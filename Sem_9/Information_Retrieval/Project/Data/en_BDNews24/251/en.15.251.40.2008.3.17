 Dhaka, March 17 (bdnews24.com)  Asian Football Confederation (AFC) president Mohamed Bin Hammam is scheduled to arrive in Dhaka on March 28. He would lay the foundations for the football centre and the synthetic football turf. Hammam will first lay the foundation of the synthetic turf next to the Bangladesh Football Federation House in Arambagh on March 29 and on the same day he will travel to Barisal to also lay the foundation stone of the football centre, said a BFF source. The BFF gets an artificial football turf on a ground known as 'Balur Math' instead of a football academy under the FIFA goal project-2. The football centre in Barisal will be built under the FIFA Tsunami Fund and will cost $ 2,50,000 as the world football governing body, FIFA, decided to build football centre-cum-cyclone centre in the coastal area of Bangladesh after Tsunami hit 13 countries in Asia in the latter part of 2004. The FIFA is also scheduled to provide the same amount for building another football centre-cum-cyclone centre in Cox's Bazar . The FIFA has also a plan to grant another $ 4,00,000 to build a football academy next to the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan under the goal project-3 immediately after the land is acquired. bdn
