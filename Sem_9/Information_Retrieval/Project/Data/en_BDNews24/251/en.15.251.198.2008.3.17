<TITLE> World must accept some blame over Kenya: group </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Nairobi, March 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World leaders had to accept some blame for the violence that rocked Kenya after a disputed December election, killing more than 1,000 people, the international Human Rights Watch group said on Monday. "Foreign governments should remember that decades of turning a blind eye to corruption, impunity and mismanagement by Kenya's governments has contributed to the recent crisis," the U.S.-based group said in a report. The world was shocked at the bloodshed in Kenya, previously seen as a haven of stability on a volatile continent, and many leaders helped pressure President Mwai Kibaki and opposition leader Raila Odinga into a Feb. 28 power-sharing pact. Human Rights Watch accused police of causing "hundreds" of deaths by using excessive force during the two-month crisis in the East African country, especially in opposition strongholds like the town of Kisumu. Fleeing children had been shot, the group said in its 88-page report. Lethal force was used quickly in opposition areas but restraint was shown towards pro-government supporters, it said. The crisis was Kenya's worst since independence from Britain in 1963 and damaged its reputation as a prosperous trade and tourism hub. Kenya is East Africa's biggest economy. Human Rights Watch blamed successive post-independence governments for failing to address land and poverty issues at the root of the violence. "Much of the ethnic-based violence was organised by local leaders, politicians and businessmen from all sides, according to eyewitnesses," it said.
