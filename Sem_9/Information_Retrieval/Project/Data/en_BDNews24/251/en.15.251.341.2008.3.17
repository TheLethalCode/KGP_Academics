<TEXT>
 Cairo, March 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Twenty-two Egyptians were killed and 13 injured on Sunday when a police transport truck loaded with conscripts collided with a truck on a highway to Alexandria, a security source said. The source said the dead included 20 police conscripts and the driver and passenger of the civilian truck. He added that the conscripts were likely headed to a police camp on the desert road leading to the coastal city. Witnesses said the truck was driving at high speed when it was involved in a head-on collision with the police transport, according to the security source. A series of road and rail accidents over the past few years has triggered a public outcry over the government's handling of road and transport safety.
