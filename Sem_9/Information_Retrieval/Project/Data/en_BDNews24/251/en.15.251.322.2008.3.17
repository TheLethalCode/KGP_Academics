 Dhaka, March 17 (bdnews24.com)  The government may reconsider tax exemptions for rice and other essentials, commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said Monday. "We will decide the issue when we are assured that the majority of people will benefit from such measures," he said in reply to questions from reporters as he was leaving the education ministry. Zillur said tax exemption for rice dealers is one of the measures the government is seriously considering to alleviate people's economic woes. Asked if the government is likely to concede tax cuts for dealers in other essential commodities, he said similar consideration was being given for staples other than rice. bdnews24.
