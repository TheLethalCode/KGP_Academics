 Shangai, March 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese shares related to Tibet tumbled in early stock trading on Monday after unrest last week in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, with tourism firm Tibet Shendi plunging its 10 percent daily limit to 13.80 yuan. "The unrest in Tibet exerted psychological pressure on investors to sell related shares, although we believe the unrest may not have a lasting effect on corporate earnings," said a senior stock analyst at a securities house in Chengdu, in western China. Technology issue Tibet Galaxy dived 8.52 percent to 9.13 yuan, Tibet Pharmaceutical dropped 7.83 percent to 12.95 yuan and trade firm Tibet Tianlu fell 7.15 percent to 15.45 yuan.
