 LONDON, March 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil plunged from a record high on Monday as a part of wider commodity sell-off sparked by growing concern over the health of the world's largest economy. US crude was trading at $106.90 by 1341 GMT, down $3.31 from the previous close. Earlier on Monday, it hit a new record of $111.80 and then fell to a session low of $105.11.

Some oil executives have also said fundamentals of supply and demand do not explain oil price strength. "From the physical point of view there is no high alarm," Royal Dutch Shell's Chief Executive Jeroen van der Veer said at a news conference. "It's difficult to understand why the oil price is where it is." But he said prices were expected to stay volatile. "We think that is quite likely because there is so much uncertainty around it, whilst the physical flow is basically the same as when the oil price was a lot lowe
