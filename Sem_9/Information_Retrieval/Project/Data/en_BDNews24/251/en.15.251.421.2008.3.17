 KUWAIT, March 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - All members of Kuwait's cabinet submitted their resignations to the prime minister on Monday, complaining of a lack of cooperation by parliament in the latest political crisis to hit the Gulf oil-exporter. Kuwait's government has been locked in a political battle with parliament that has paralysed political life in the Gulf Arab country for much of the past year. "Some members (of parliament) have continued to adopt confrontational stances with the government and to interfere in the jurisdictions of its ministers... expanding the rift between them," said the resignation letter signed by Deputy Prime Minister Sheikh Jaber Mubarak al-Sabah and carried by state news agency KUNA. "My colleagues and I ... put our resignations at your disposal so that your highness can decide what is appropriate." Parliament has repeatedly grilled ministers over their conduct, which has resulted in several resignations. Kuwait has yet to name an oil minister to replace Badr al-Humaidhi, who resigned days after his appointment in November under pressure from hostile deputies. "It is unfortunate that we face obstructive positions and practices... and a deviation in the concept of parliamentary representation," Sheikh Jaber said. Emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, who has the last say in politics, is abroad. He has repeatedly urged deputies and the government to work together for the sake of the country, but to little avail. Political sources said the move might prompt the country's ruler to dissolve parliament because the cabinet had already been reshuffled and this had failed to break the deadlock. For the resignation to come into effect, the prime minister would now have to present it to the deputy emir, who is in charge of the country in the ruler's absence, who would then have to approve it. TIME FOR CHANGE Jaber al-Muhelbi, an Islamist MP, blamed the government for the breakdown in cooperation between the two branches of government and said it was high time for a new parliament. "The government in my opinion is weak... the government is not cooperating," he said. "I'd welcome a dissolution of parliament if it's for citizens' benefit." Parliament's financial committee on Sunday demanded another pay rise for public servants despite a raise in February to counter high inflation, putting it on confrontation course with the government. Newspapers had also reported recently that the government wanted to remove diwaniyas -- popular gathering spots in tents -- as many are on government land. Lawmakers oppose the move. Kuwait's only woman minister won a confidence vote in parliament in January. She was the last in a series of ministers to face pressure from lawmakers. Abdullah al-Ajmi, an independent MP, welcomed the resignation saying it was the government's only way out of its problems. "The government has proved its inability to deal with the parliament and solve issues towards (approving) the 50 dinar increase and not demolishing the diwaniyas," he said. "This resignation should have come earlier before the problems escalate
