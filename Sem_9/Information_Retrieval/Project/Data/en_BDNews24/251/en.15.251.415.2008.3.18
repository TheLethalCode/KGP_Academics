 Bangladesh EN Rajshahi, March 18 (bdnews24.com) -- President Iajuddin Ahmed stressed the importance of science and technology education in the age of globalisation, as he spoke at Rajshahi University of Engineering Technology's third convocation ceremony Tuesday. "A country that is highly advanced in terms of science and technology will be the most successful," said Iajuddin. "Even though our country has vast human resources, we have not been able to achieve our goals due to a lack of technical excellence." The president said Bangladesh needed to produce more skilled engineers and science based graduates to face the challenges of the 21st century. He termed teachers as "the builders of the nation" and asked them to pay more attention to research programmes. Addressing the graduating class, Iajuddin said: "You have to move ahead with a firm commitment to build the nation." "You must use your knowledge for the welfare of society and its citizens." The president arrived at Rajshahi airport Tuesday morning ahead of inaugurating the RUET convocation ceremony midday. RUET vice-chancellor Dr AFM Anwarul Haq welcomed the president. Later, former students of the institution were awarded gold medals for academic excellence. bdnews
