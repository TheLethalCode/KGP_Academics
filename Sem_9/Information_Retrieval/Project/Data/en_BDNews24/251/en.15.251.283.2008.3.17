 JERUSALEM, March 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israel and Germany are united in their concern over Iran's nuclear ambitions and both support the need to stop its enrichment of uranium, leaders of the two countries said on Monday. "We regard with grave concern, in a very similar way, the continuation of Iran's steps to develop nuclear armament," Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said at a joint news conference in Jerusalem with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. "We are also joined in our acknowledgement that there is a need to continue to conduct a series of steps that will bring this development process to a halt," Olmert said.

Olmert has previously said Israel would consider "all options" to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, but Israeli leaders have stopped short of any direct threat of military action against the Islamic Republic. Merkel, 53, Germany's first chancellor to be born after World War Two, visited the Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum on Monday and laid a wreath at the Hall of Remembrance to the 6 million Jews killed in the Nazi Holocaust. On Tuesday, she will become the first German chancellor to address the 120-member Knesset, or parliament.
