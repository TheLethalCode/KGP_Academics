 Dhaka, March 16 (bdnews24.com)The Awami League and its front organisations mark the 88th birth anniversary of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Monday. The AL leaders led by the party's acting president Zillur Rahman will lay wreaths at the portrait of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman at Bangabandhu Memorial Museum in Dhanmondi Monday. In a statement Sunday, Zillur demanded release of Bangabandhu's daughter and former prime minister Sheikh Hasina from jail, who was arrested on July 16 last year on charges of extortion. The AL will celebrate the day as "National Children's Day"an idea introduced by the Hasina administrationas part of its two-day programme. The independence leader popularly referred to as Sheikh Mujib and with the honorary title of Bangabandhu was born in 1920 in Tungipara, a village in Gopalganj. He rose as a charismatic and forceful orator in the then East Pakistan politics. Sheikh Mujib demanded increased provincial autonomy and became a fierce opponent of the military rule of Ayub Khan. At the height of tension, Sheikh Mujib outlined a six-point autonomy plan seen as separatism by Pakistani rulers. After talks with President Yahya Khan fell apart, Sheikh Mujib was arrested and taken to Pakistan. A full-blown war that staggered for nine months between the Pakistan army and Bangladesh, aided by Indian forces, led to the independence of Bangladesh in 1971. Sheikh Mujib assumed office as president after his release and later became prime minister. Amid rising agitation, he banned other political parties in 1975. Mujib was assassinated along with most of his family by a group of army officers. bdnews2
