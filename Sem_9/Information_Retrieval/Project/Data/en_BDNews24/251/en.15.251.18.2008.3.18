 Dhaka, March 18 (bdnews24.com)The panel led by former BGMEA president Annisul Huq has clinched a big-margin victory in the chamber group by beating its rival 11 to 1 in the biennial election to the governing body of FBCCI, according to official results announced early Tuesday. Vote-taking continued from 9am Monday to 4:30pm for voters to elect 12 directors each from chamber and association groups. In the chamber group, 306 people cast votes.

FBCCI election board chairman Ali Ashraf who announced the results said the polls officials had started tallying up the votes in the association group. In the association group, 1,135 voters out of the 1,235 cast votes. Another 14 directorsseven members from as many chambers and another seven from seven associations have already been nominated. All 38 directors will elect the president and the vice president Wednesday.

FBCCI administrator Syed Manzur Elahi told reporters: "The government set us a deadline to hold an election by April 5. I am glad we held the election by the deadline."
