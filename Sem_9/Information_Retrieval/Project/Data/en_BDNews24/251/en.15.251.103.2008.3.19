<TEXT>
 LE PETIT BORNAND, France, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy said on Tuesday he was determined to press on with economic reforms after his centre-right UMP party suffered big losses in local elections at the weekend. "What is sure is that I will need to take a certain number of initiatives to continue the changes that are needed for our country," he said at the sidelines of a commemoration for France's World War Two resistance movement. "I was elected to conduct these policies and that's what I am going to do," he said. Sarkozy, whose own personal unpopularity played a big role in the campaign, has made little direct comment on the election, that left the opposition Socialists in charge of seven of France's top 10 cities including the capital Paris as well as most of its administrative regions. Ten months after his election in May 2007, his image has been dented by crumbling public confidence in the economy and irritation at a sometimes impetuous and brusque manner that many voters feel is unbecoming of a president. Sarkozy's public agenda this week has been filled mainly with events in keeping with the traditional role of the president, beginning with a commemoration on Monday for the last French veteran of World War One. On Tuesday, he continued with a visit to the Glieres plateau in the mountainous Haute Savoie region of eastern France, scene of a major battle between wartime resistance forces and the occupying Germans. "This is not the place for a political speech and there's so much agitation," he said. "There needs to be a lot of calm in the position I hold, a lot of cool-headedness." Sarkozy's comments came ahead of a minor reshuffle of government posts that is not expected to affect any of the main ministries or members of cabinet. Prime Minister Francois Fillon was seen entering the Elysee Palace on Tuesday evening, where he remained for about an hour to discuss the changes. The main spokesman for the president's office, David Martinon has been the most prominent victim of the election, being replaced after a botched bid to become mayor of Neuilly, the chic Paris suburb where Sarkozy himself served as mayor. Laurent Wauquiez, the spokesman for the government (as opposed to the president), is also tipped to move to take a junior ministerial post and could be replaced by Consumer Affairs minister Luc Chat
