<TEXT>
 LONDON, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British software company Misys said on Tuesday it would merge its healthcare arm with Nasdaq-listed Allscripts, a deal it said would help raise group revenue growth to 7-9 percent next year. The firm said it would raise around 75 million pounds ($150 million) in a share placing to help fund the deal, which will see it pay $330 million for a controlling 54.5 percent stake in the combined entity. "Misys healthcare has struggled in the last couple of years, but this is all about .. taking a very powerful footprint in the US ... Misys will become a growth company again," Chief Executive Mike Lawrie told reporters, adding that the deal was a key stage of the company's turnaround launched a year ago.

It will immediately have one in three U.S. physicians as clients. "The healthcare market in the US is growing at more than twice Gross National Product (GDP), and is more immune to the ups and downs in the economic cycle," Lawrie said. He will be executive chairman of the new company, which will be valued at just over $1 billion. Allscripts CEO Glen Tullman will be chief executive. Separately, Misys said its third-quarter operating profit was up 166 percent at 15 million pounds and upgraded sales growth forecasts for the current year to 2-4 percent from 2-3 percent in January. "We are still not seeing any slowdown in demand," Lawrie said. The group's banking division delivered 24 percent third- quarter growth, while the treasury and markets arm was up 15 perce
