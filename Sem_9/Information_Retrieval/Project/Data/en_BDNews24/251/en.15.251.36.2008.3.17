 Dhaka, March 17 (bdnews24.com)  National and upazila polls may be held simultaneously, said the chief election commissioner Monday after inspecting the elections to the FBCCI governing body. The Election Commission had earlier planned local government polls ahead of year-end national elections, but the decision ran into fierce opposition from most political parties, including the Awami League. Speaker Jamirdduin Sircar said Sunday that the caretaker government must prioritise national elections over the local government polls as he said a parliamentary election is its main job. The FBCCI elections began at 9am Monday to continue through to 4:30pm for the voters to elect 12 directors each from chamber and association groups. "FBCCI is holding both chamber group and association group elections together here. We are also considering holding the national and upazila polls simultaneously. No decision has been made on the issue though," said CEC ATM Shamsul Huda. FBCCI is using transparent ballot boxes for its elections. Huda said: "We'll collect sample boxes and test their suitability." The race saw 22 contestants in the association group and 27 in the chamber group. The voters this year number 1,536, an FBCCI election official said. Another 14 directorsseven members from as many chambers and another seven from seven associations have already been nominated. All 38 directors will elect the president and the vice president Wednesday. Former BGMEA president Annisul Huq and former FBCCI director MA Rouf Chowdhury are contenders for president. Prof Ali Ashraf, chairman of the election board, told bdnews24.com that elections are being held at the FBCCI using transparent ballot boxes. "The ballot boxes have been brought in from abroad as a test case, but such boxes can also be made locally," he said. The CEC has expressed satisfaction over the FBCCI polls, Ashraf said. The national elections can also be held successfully if the Election Commission demonstrates "expected skills and sincerity", he added. bdnews24
