<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 18 (bdnews24.com) - The government has moved to merge Bangladesh Shilpa Bank and Bangladesh Shilpa Rin Sangstha, the finance adviser said Tuesday. The merger is being initiated since both organisations have similar mandates to contribute to the country's industrialisation, said adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam. "It is better to have one entity at a time operating in the relevant capacity," the adviser told reporters after attending an event organised to transfer BSRS earnings to the government exchequer. The adviser said primary assessments in this regard have been initiated. "We have yet to set a timeframe for effecting the merger of the two organisations." On rumours of BSRS privatisation bids, Aziz clarified: "BSRS is not going to be privatised. We thought of floating some BSRS shares in the market, which might be done now after the merger is done." The BSRS has transferred Tk 1 crore to the government exchequer this year, the adviser said. BSRS director SRM Hafizul Islam said to reporters: "In its present circumstances, BSRS cannot contribute to our industrial development. That is why the government has decided to integrate the two." Both organisations are running profitably at the moment and their rates of loan realisation have also enhanced, Islam said. bdnews24.com
