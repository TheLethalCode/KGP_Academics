 WELLINGTON, March 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The 164-run partnership between Tim Ambrose and Paul Collingwood in England's first innings was the difference between the two sides in the second test, New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori said on Monday.

New Zealand, who had won the first test by 189 runs, were bowled out early on the fifth and final day for 311 at the Basin reserve, chasing a record 438 to win the match. Brendon McCullum top-scored with a swashbuckling 85 before he was the last man out, hitting Monty Panesar down to long-on where Ryan Sidebottom took the catch in front of the vocal "Barmy Army" travelling support. Vettori also felt the bowling of the recalled James Anderson on the second day, when he tore the top off New Zealand's batting lineup, had been a major factor in the outcome of the match. "For us to be bowled out for 198 in the first innings was purely down to him," Vettori added. "He hit the right lengths early on and did a really good job
