 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, March 18 (bdnews24.com) -- Call centres have the potential to bring a revolutionary change in the country's telecommunications sector, BTRC's chairman told bdnews24.com ahead of a public hearing on call centre guidelines to be held Wednesday. "The telecom sector can be a major source of earning foreign currency. It can create employment as there is potentially a big market for call centres in our country," Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission chairman Manzurul Alam said Tuesday. The telecom industry will become the largest earner for the country in future, Alam told bdnews24.com prior to the public hearing on guidelines for setting up call centres to be held at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre on Wednesday. BTRC official Abdullah Ferdous told bdnews24.com the guidelines are being prepared based on public opinion. "Such a public hearing is going to be held for the first time ever in Bangladesh, particularly in the telecom sector," Ferdous said. Some 2,100 interested individuals have so far registered to take part in the public hearing, BTRC said. The hearing will be held in two sessions -- the first to start at 10am and the second at 3pm, the duration of each session will be three hours. The proposed call centres will not only receive subscriber's calls, it will also provide data and information processing services, Ferdous said. India is in the top position in such business processing outsourcing services, he said. Call centres have the potential to become a larger foreign currency earner than garments in future, Ferdous added. BTRC invited opinions by Internet for preparing the draft call centre guidelines. They will be finalised after Wednesday's hearing in coordination with further opinions invited by Internet. Licences will be distributed for three kinds of centres -- call centres, hosted call centres and hosted call centre service providers. The draft guidelines have set Tk 50,000 for a licence fee. The fee might be reduced, said the BTRC chairman. "We have talented youth in this country. They guidelines seek to provide them licences on easy conditions so that they can realise the potential of their talent and earn foreign currency for the country at the same time," Alam said. bdnews
