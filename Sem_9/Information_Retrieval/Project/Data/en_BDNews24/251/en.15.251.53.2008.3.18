<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 18 (bdnews24.com)  Regulatory Reforms Commission chairman Akbar Ali Khan Tuesday predicted social instability if the prices of daily essentials were not brought within the purchasing power of ordinary people. Speaking to reporters after a meeting of the commission in Motijheel, the former adviser to the caretaker government said the spiralling prices had been testing the patience of the people. "They would have taken to the street long ago had there been no emergency in the country. But the seething anger of the people may make them explode any time if things go beyond their level of patience causing a social instability," he added. Asked if he still believed that there had been a silent famine in the country, the former adviser said: "Some people in government said I had exaggerated. Some others differed." "I made the remark observing the situation of the country. People don't starve to death if there is a silent famine in any country. They suffer from malnutrition and various diseases due to lack of food. "Children are the worst victims of such situation. Women come next after children in getting affected by the shortage of food," he said. bdnews
