The bench also gave a verdict cancelling businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury's case against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina.

The bench passed a verdict, declaring illegal the Anticorruption Commission's notice seeking a wealth statement from Hasina. In a Feb 18 verdict, the bench ruled illegal acting law secretary Kazi Habibul Awal's appointment. The opinion given for appointing Awal as acting secretary was not of the Supreme Court and it was the opinion of the chief justice, the bench said. According to article 94 of the constitution, the Supreme Court means the Appellate Division and the High Court Division, the judges had explained. The Supreme Court consists of the judges of both divisions, but the two judges said they were not aware of anything about the appointment.
