 DUBAI, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South African Imtiaz Patel, whose career spans sports administration and broadcasting, was selected on Monday as the preferred candidate to take over as chief executive of the International Cricket Council (ICC). The 43-year-old has been approached to succeed Australia's Malcolm Speed, who will step down in June after seven years in office, said cricket's governing body. "We are delighted Imtiaz is the board's choice for the post of next ICC chief executive. I have no doubt that if he accepts the position he will do a great job," said ICC president Ray Mali. ICC president-elect David Morgan, who will take over from Mali in June, said: "There was an absolute consensus on his choice. He was among the six candidates shortlisted for the job ... from a list of 15 chosen by our consultants. "We still have to negotiate the terms and conditions of the contract with Mr Patel. The initial contract will be for a term of three years." A former Soweto teacher, Patel worked for the United Cricket Board (UCB), predecessor of Cricket South Africa, from 1991 to 1999. He then joined broadcaster Supersport. Ali Bacher, who was UCB chief executive when Patel joined the board, had rich praise for his fellow South African. 'NO BAGGAGE' "He is steeped in cricket and passionate about the game," Bacher told Reuters from Johannesburg. "He has also done very well at Supersport and the biggest single source of income in world cricket is Asian television. He has energy and enthusiasm for cricket and he comes with no cricket baggage." Patel was named Supersport's director of enterprises in 2000 and the network's director of productions in 2003. He was appointed chief executive in 2005. A board member of South African soccer's Premier League, Patel is also a director of Supersport United Football Club and the Sharks and Cheetahs rugby franchises. "I am satisfied we have exhausted every avenue to find the best person for the job." said Morga
