<TEXT>
 Guahati, India, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Unidentified militants blindfolded seven people and shot them in India's volatile northeastern state of Manipur, police said on Tuesday. The victims of Monday night's shooting were all settlers from northern India. Rebels groups in the region often attack Hindi-speaking settlers accusing them of corrupting the local culture. Police said the seven were brought in a vehicle and executed by the roadside near the capital city Imphal. "Villagers informed the police after they heard gunshots," a senior police officer told Reuters. He said no militant group has claimed responsibility for the incident.
