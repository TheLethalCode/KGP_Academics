 LONDON, March 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former England batsman Marcus Trescothick withdrew from Somerset's pre-season tour to Dubai after suffering a recurrence of a stress-related illness, the County said on Sunday. The 32-year-old, who left early from England's last Ashes tour of Australia having earlier failed to complete a trip to India in 2006, withdrew on Friday just before Somerset were due to depart. "Marcus took the decision himself and the club are fully supportive," Somerset chief executive Richard Gould told club's Website (www.somersetcountycc.premiumtv.co.uk). "He has returned home to Taunton to be with his family and we look forward to him playing a full part in our season." Director of cricket Brian Rose said he expected the left hander, who scored more than 5,000 runs in his 76 Tests up to August 2006, to play a full role for the county in the forthcoming season. "I spoke to Marcus last night and while it is unfortunate that he has had a reoccurrence of his stress problems I am certain he will be available to start the season with Somerset," he told the Web site. "Marcus did a tremendous job for us last season and will be a key player again this summer.
