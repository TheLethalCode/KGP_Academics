<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 16 (bdnews24.com)  Pakistani security expert Ikram Sehgal Sunday said the army in Bangladesh should not be involved in the state affairs for long. The Bangladesh military should take lesson from Pakistan and not get involved in the running of economy as well as day-to-day affairs, he said. He added that there were commonalities between the events in Bangladesh and Pakistan. Sehgal, the publisher and editor of Pakistan's Defence Journal, underlined the need for holding the national polls immediately. "I believe the army has very short, very limited and specific duties. Several months are OK, " he told journalists while exchanging views on Pakistan's pre- and post-election situations at the auditorium of the Dhaka Reporters' Unity in the city. Terming Bangladesh's army smarter than Pakistan's, Sehgal said Bangladesh army's role in curbing corruption and saving democracy  which he termed "Bangladesh model"  was "very good". "I think that the Bangladesh model should not be for two years," he said. "They (army) should not get involved in day-to-day affairs. You (army) cannot be involved in the economy," Sehgal said. "I am sorry to say that army officers have no role in business." He said the people of Pakistan used to love armed forces very much but in recent months they had been frustrated with the army. Pakistan's army chief took back all defence members posted in different public institutions and instructed the armed forces and the intelligence agencies not to talk to the politicians. "We have a very good army chief. He wanted to see a free and fair election," he said. "Yes, I find a lot of similarities between events in Pakistan and Bangladesh. The army (in Bangladesh) should learn the lessons from the other's mistakes," Sehgal said. "Hundred percent, if the army was not taken back [to the barrack], the general elections in Pakistan would have surely been rigged," Sehgal told bdnews24.com replying to a question. "How an election could be rigged if the military could not meet politicians," he questioned. He said if the Election Commission was ready Bangladesh should go for elections. On reforms in the political parties, he said the government should not manipulate the natural system of creating leaders. "When there is a vacuum, the patriotic leaders in the parties come up as part of a natural process," he said. Sehgal also urged the government not to form a political party. He supported the resumption of rail links with India. "India is big and strong country and we should strengthen our relations with India for greater prosperity. The majority of Indians are good people like us." He said the media in Bangladesh were experiencing some government restrictions. "I think the media in Bangladesh are 50 independent and there are some sort of restrictions." Terming the media the best apparatus to ensure accountability, he urged the government to make friends with the media. bd
