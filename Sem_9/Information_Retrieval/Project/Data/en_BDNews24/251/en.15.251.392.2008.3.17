 Dhaka, March 17 (bdnews24.com) -- Visiting UNDP chief Kemal Dervis said Monday he was happy with preparations for the upcoming national polls and voter listing. In a statement to the media, prior to his departure from Bangladesh after a three-day visit, Dervis said that like many others, he believed national elections would be held on time. The United Nations Development Programme administrator and UN under secretary-general also praised the caretaker administration's efforts in preparing the voter lists. "What I have seen here and learnt about this country tells me that democracy belongs in Bangladesh. This is people with a strong love for democracy, a passion for independence, and need for forthright discussion and exchange of views," the UNDP chief said. "This is an extraordinarily important chapter in the history of Bangladesh," he said. "The country is facing important decisions, on how to further economic growth in a difficult global economic environment, and how to make sure that democracy deepens and endures." "I am impressed by the sincerity and commitment of the government to make this happen." "I look forward to all actors, especially political parties, coming forward to play their vital role constructively." Praising the government's undertaking to register all voters electronically, he said: "The voters' list is expected to be the most accurate list the country has ever had, and the undertaking is impressive by all international standards." Dervis said he was proud UNDP had played a role in the effort to register 80 million people, adding: "Bangladesh will have electronically registered the largest number of voters in the shortest period of time, ever, in any country." Regarding the spiralling cost of essentials in the market, Dervis said he had discussions with leading economists of the country: "We talked about the international commodity price shocks and what they mean here in Bangladesh." "As you know, prices are hurting many countries around the globe not only here in Bangladesh. The real issue is protecting the vulnerable from these shocks. The international community cannot leave these huge world events unattended." For an export-oriented economy like Bangladesh, what happens in the world economy is vitally important, Dervis said, adding that "the world economy is at a crossroads". Dervis said during his visit he had extremely informative meetings with the president, the finance adviser, the army chief, the chief election commissioner, various civil society leaders and business leaders. "I am proud of the long history and partnership that the United Nations has with Bangladesh, a country that gives so generously towards UN peacekeeping and has made so many other significant contributions." "It is a valued member of the UNDP Executive Board. It is respected for initiating the annual UN General Assembly resolution on a culture of peace, and for being a founding member of both the Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights Council." Dervis stressed the importance of voter participation in the polls and the need for all to accept the results following the election. The UNDP chief also said it was a matter for the people and the government to decide whether the local elections would be held before or after the national polls. On the US State Department's Country Report on human rights, Dervis said that any violation had to be considered "a big problem" and that it was the responsibility of the government to uphold human rights. Regarding the detention of politicians without trial, Dervis said that anybody could be tried, although no one could be labelled as guilty before the trial was completed. Dervis also said he was happy with Bangladesh's progress towards achieving Millennium Development Goals, especially progress in the fields of education and pure water supply. Dervis arrived in Bangladesh Saturday, and in addition to meeting the country's leaders he also toured areas affected by last year's devastating cyclone and inspected the voter listing process. UN resident coordinator Renata Dessallien also attended Monday's press briefing. bdnews24.com/
