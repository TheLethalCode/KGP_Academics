<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 18 (bdnews24.com)The Securities and Exchange Commission Tuesday rejected the IPO prospectus for Grameen Mutual Fund Two, a second scheme of Grameen Mutual Fund One. SEC executive director Farhad Ahmed told reporters in his office that the prospectus had been rejected because it failed to comply with the securities law. "The decision to reject the prospectus was made as no certificate of deposit for the Tk 17 crore pre-IPO placement for the fund's first scheme holders was submitted to the SEC," he said. In line with the securities law, sponsors can raise the money through a pre-IPO placement, a private placement before the IPO. In this case, sponsors have to submit a bank deposit certificate of the placement money to the market regulator prior to approval. The prospectus for Grameen Mutual Fund Two was submitted to the SEC on Jan 22. Grameen Bank was the sponsor of the fund and the issue manager was AIMS of Bangladesh, a private asset management company. Meanwhile, AIMS of Bangladesh announced March 25 as the record date for entitlement of Grameen Mutual Fund One holders. "We have set the record date for entitlement on March 25. We will entitle shares at a 1:1 ratio to the first scheme holders then," Yaweer Sayeed, CEO of AIMS of Bangladesh, told bdnews24.com. Subscriptions for the private placement start on April 1 and end on April 10, he added. Sayeed said that they were not willing to hold common people's money without approval from the regulator. "However, we took initiatives to raise the money for the private placement, and will submit the prospectus along with the deposit certificate," he said. bdn
