 MADRID, March 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona were held to a 2-2 draw at promoted Almeria in the Primera Liga on Sunday as they failed to make the most of leaders Real Madrid's 1-0 defeat away to Deportivo Coruna on Saturday. Bojan Krkic and Samuel Eto'o put Barca on course to cut Real's lead to five points, but after they had Gabriel Milito sent off late on, Almeria grabbed an 85th-minute equaliser through Kalu Uche. Real have 62 points, seven ahead of second-placed Barca on 55, while Villarreal climbed to 53 after they overcame Real Zaragoza 2-0 at home. Building on their 2-1 win at the Nou Camp last weekend, Turkish striker Nihat Kahveci gave Villarreal an early lead and Italian striker Giuseppe Rossi made sure of the points from the penalty spot in the second half. But much of the credit must go to their goalkeeper Diego Lopez who denied Zaragoza on numerous occasions. Uruguay striker Diego Forlan scored two for Atletico Madrid in their 3-0 home win over Levante that put them back in fourth place on 47 points, two ahead of Sevilla and Espanyol in fifth and sixth respectively. Getafe made it 11 games unbeaten in all competitions when they came from behind to beat their King's Cup semi-final opponents Racing Santander 2-1 at the Coliseum. Goals from Nigeria striker Ikechukwu Uche and Jaime Gavilan give Getafe the psychological edge for when the sides meet again on Wednesday for their semi-final, second leg at the Sardinero. Getafe hold a 3-1 lead.

However, the set-piece specialists were soon level from a corner in the 33rd when defender Ruben Pulido was left with a free header at the near post. Frank Rijkaard brought on Thierry Henry just after the restart and he cut to the line to pull back for Cameroon striker Eto'o to net, with one of his first interventions. Argentina centre back Milito collected his second yellow card with 18 minutes to go, and Almeria punished Barca once again from a corner as Nigerian Uche rose to head past Victor Valdes in the 85th. Barca have taken one point from the last nine available
