<TITLE> Japan nominates new BOJ governor, opposition wary </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Tokyo, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Japanese government put forward on Tuesday a former top finance ministry bureaucrat to run the central bank, but a senior opposition lawmaker warned the surprise choice was likely to be vetoed just like its first choice. The government named Koji Tanami, currently head of a government-backed lending agency, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, to head the central bank, a document obtained by Reuters showed. The name surprised analysts, who had not seen Tanami as a potential candidate. The government, eyeing the global credit crisis but caught in a stalemate with opposition lawmakers who rejected its initial BOJ governor nominee, has just one day to go until current governor Toshihiko Fukui is due to retire. Analysts and the government say the Bank of Japan must not suffer a leadership vacuum at a time when major central banks are taking coordinated action to combat the crisis and calm turbulent markets. However, it looked unlikely that Tanami, 68, would be accepted by opposition lawmakers that control parliament's upper house, thus holding the power to veto his appointment. Tanami held the same rank at the finance ministry, although in a different department, as that once held by Toshiro Muto -- the current deputy BOJ governor who was blocked in parliament last week when nominated for governor. A senior lawmaker in Japan's main opposition Democratic party, Kenji Yamaoka, said there was almost no chance the party would accept Tanami as BOJ governor. "Personally, I think it is almost impossible," Yamaoka said, adding his party would decide its stance by the end of the day. Parliament is expected to vote on the government's new nominations on Wednesday. GYRATING MARKETS The credit crunch and fears of a U.S. recession briefly drove the dollar below 96 yen to a 13-year low on Monday and sent Japanese shares down nearly 4 percent. Stocks made up some lost ground on Tuesday, with the benchmark Nikkei gaining 1.5 percent, while the dollar held around 97 yen. "At a time of severe global market conditions, we would like to put forward excellent candidates for governor and deputy governor who can fully take responsibility as members of a leading economic power," the top government spokesman, Nobutaka Machimura, told reporters. Analysts said it was important for the post to be filled by the time Fukui retired, and questioned how Japan could allow political squabbling over the job in a time of crisis. One economist suggested Tanami might be more dovish than the government's past nominees, but others were left seeking more information about him. "The issue is, does he have a good understanding of financial markets? Is he good at communication, particularly with foreigners and in English?," asked Robert Feldman, chief economist at Morgan Stanley in Tokyo. "Does he know the Japanese economy thoroughly and does he have experience working in financial markets? Those are the criteria that have to be balanced." The government also named current BOJ board member Kiyohiko Nishimura to become a deputy governor at the central bank, and he appeared more likely to win parliamentary approval. The Democratic Party's secretary general said Nishimura was a good choice for deputy, making it likely he would join another nominee for deputy, Masaaki Shirakawa, who was approved last week. Shirakawa is a retired career central bank official. POLITICIANS UNPOPULAR The political fight over who should succeed Fukui adds to the political paralysis in parliament, where the government has struggled to pass laws since the opposition won control of the upper house. Political analysts said the BOJ fuss would likely further dent Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda's already sagging public support and might lead to some calls to replace him. But unless his ratings slumped to around 20 percent his job might well be safe since any new PM would simply face the same problem of a divided parliament. A Yomiuri newspaper poll on Tuesday showed public support for Fukuda mired around 34 percent, with a disapproval rating of 54 percent. The same poll showed 59 percent unhappy that the Democrat-led opposition parties had vetoed Muto for BOJ governor, showing voters were unhappy with both sides in the debate. If no new governor is confirmed by March 19, the government would have the option of installing one of the new deputies into the role temporarily. It could also extend the term of Fukui while considering long-term options, although analysts and others have called for a permanent leader at a time of crisis. "What's most important for the market is that they decide on a new governor by tomorrow," said Yumi Nishimura, the manager of Daiwa Securities SMBC's investment advisory section. "Investors, especially foreign investors, don't like it that the government cannot decide on a new governor in this market environment, including unstable currency moves." Deadlock over Fukui's successor would not have a big impact on monetary policy, however, since Japan's interest rates are near rock bottom, analysts say.
