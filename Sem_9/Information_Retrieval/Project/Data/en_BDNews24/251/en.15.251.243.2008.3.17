<TITLE> Britain's Brown promises inquiry into Iraq war </TITLE>

 LONDON, March 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British Prime Minister Gordon Brown will hold an inquiry into the Iraq war but will not do so until Britain's armed forces have withdrawn, a government minister said on Monday. Brown's decision marks a shift from the policy of his predecessor Tony Blair, who took Britain to war in Iraq five years ago against a background of fierce political and public opposition which has still not abated. Monday's Independent newspaper quoted a letter written by Brown to a left-leaning think tank, The Fabian Society, in which he said: "There will come a time when it is appropriate to hold an inquiry." He gave no details of how broad any inquiry would be, or when it would be launched, but stressed it would not be now.

At the end of 2007, Britain had about 4,500 troops left in Iraq, less than 10 percent of the force sent by Blair to join the US-led invasion to topple Saddam Hussein in 2003. Brown has said the force will shrink to 2,500 by the middle of this year, including a small training mission and a rapid response team on standby. No timetable has been set for a full withdrawal of British troo
