<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 18 (bdnews24.com)  The Appellate Division Tuesday adjourned until April 23 the hearing on a government appeal against a previous ruling by the High Court that had scrapped an extortion case against Sheikh Hasina. The Tk 3 crore extortion case brought by businessman Azam Jahagir Chowdhury alleges Hasina received the amount during her 1996-2001 premiership in exchange for awarding power plant contracts. The case was filed with Gulshan Police Station on June 13, 2007. On Feb 6, the High Court quashed the extortion case, ruling that bringing the case under emergency powers rules (EPR) had been illegal. The ruling came on a writ petition filed by Hasina challenging the case's trial under EPR. A seven-strong full bench of the Appellate Division chaired by chief justice Md Ruhul Amin adjourned proceedings until April 23, as a member of the bench was scheduled to go abroad on Wednesday for medical treatment for one month. As per the rule of the Appellate Division, the hearing cannot resume if any justice of the full bench is absent. Additional attorney general Salauddin Ahmed, who took part in the hearing, said: "A case is taken under emergency powers rules if the government approves." The court asked what was the reason and consequence for such approval. Salauddin replied: "The accused will not be granted bail and the case will be resolved quickly." "The accused cannot contest the polls until the appeal is resolved," he added. Attorney general barrister Fida M Kamal was present in the court during the proceedings. Barrister Rafique-ul-Huq and barrister Sheikh Fazle Nur Taposh represented Hasina. The Appellate Division on Feb 26 accepted the government's leave to appeal against the High Court verdict. The Supreme Court also stayed that verdict but temporarily upheld the High Court ban on proceedings of the extortion case in the trial court. The government filed a motion with the Appellate Division on Feb 18, seeking permission to appeal the High Court verdict. Hasina was arrested on July 16, 2007 and was shown arrested in the case later the same day after inclusion of the case proceedings under EPR. Charges were framed against the accused, including Hasina's sister, Sheikh Rehana, on Jan 13. According to the case details, the accused received a total of Tk 2.99 crore from the businessman in 2001 in exchange for illegally awarding a contract to build Siddhirganj Power Station. Hasina and other accused have rejected the allegations. bdnews24.com/at/
