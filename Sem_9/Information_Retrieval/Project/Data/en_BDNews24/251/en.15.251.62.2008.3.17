<TITLE> Dollar`s nosedive stirs joint intervention jitters </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Tokyo, March 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The dollar's sharp slide to 13-year lows against the yen and all-time lows versus the euro on Monday is stoking jitters about the possibility of joint intervention to prop up the dollar. "The speed of the slide in the dollar/yen is so rapid that U.S. action alone can no longer stop the dollar's downward trend," said Koichi Ogawa, chief portfolio manager at Daiwa SB Investment. "The time is ripe for coordinated intervention by U.S., European and Japanese authorities." The dollar plummetted against the yen and euro on investor fears that more financial institutions could become casualties in the widening U.S. financial crisis that led to JPMorgan Chase acquiring investment bank Bear Stearns The dollar fell three percent against the yen to a 13-year low of 95.77 yen on electronic trading platform EBS and was poised for its biggest one-day drop against the yen since 1998. The euro vaulted 1.5 percent to $1.5905 the highest since the single European currency was launched in 1999. Traders said the foreign exchange market was near a state of panic, and that given this state of affairs, joint action to bolster the dollar could not be ruled out. Some traders said coordinated dollar-buying intervention may conceivably happen as soon as markets in London open on Monday. "Solo intervention by Japan seems difficult. But given this market turmoil, the US and Europe could move and conduct coordinated intervention in the currency market," says a senior options trader at a Japanese bank in Tokyo. There was still some scepticism toward the chances for joint intervention, however. "The Fed's dollar position has been relaxed so far, and will most probably remain so," Benedikt Germanier, currency strategist at UBS said in a research note. "Joint intervention seems also less likely as the ECB is busy managing inflation expectations," he said, adding that the last joint intervention had taken place in September 2000 to stem a decline in the euro. In addition, Japanese authorities had "failed to draw a line in the sand", he said. "The risk of an indifferent position will be a disorderly fall in the dollar accompanied by a further decline in U.S. equities and sharply rising yields. This would have very negative consequences on the real economy as well," Germanier said.
