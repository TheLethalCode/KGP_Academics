<TEXT>
 London, March 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Futures for major European stock indexes tumbled early on Monday, pointing to sharp falls when shares start trading at 0800 GMT. DJ Eurostoxx 50 futures were down 2.6 percent, German DAX futures were down 2.5 percent and futures for France's CAC were down 2.1 percent. The fall in European index futures was prompted by intensified fears over the global banking system after the takeover of Bear Stearns. The euro surged against the dollar and investors sought safe haven Treasuries.
