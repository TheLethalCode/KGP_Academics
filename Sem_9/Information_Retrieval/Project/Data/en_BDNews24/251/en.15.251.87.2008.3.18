 HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - Top Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba.com Ltd said on Tuesday its full-year 2007 profit grew 340 percent, boosted by a buoyant Chinese economy, increasing Internet access in the country and healthy growth in the firm's number of paying members. Alibaba.com, an online business-to-business site connecting companies looking to import and export Chinese goods, was founded in 1999 as a bulletin board for businesses to post trade leads. Last year, Alibaba had a 57.3 percent share of China's 3.9 billion yuan business-to-business market, according to local data firm iResearch. Alibaba's shares lost more than one-fifth of their value on Tuesday before the results were announced, following a sell-off of Nasdaq-listed Chinese Internet companies overnight. Alibaba, in which U.S. Internet company Yahoo is a key investor, reported profit of 967.8 million yuan ($136.7 million) for the year to the end of 2007, compared with 219.93 million yuan a year earlier. The result beat Goldman Sachs' forecast of 947 million yuan and Cazenove's estimate of 889 million yuan. Alibaba's stock had fallen by more than 44 percent this year through Monday, compared with a 24 percent fall in the benchmark Hang Seng Index. Its shares closed down 21 percent on Tuesday at HK$12.20, below its initial public offering price of HK$13.50 last November. Alibaba's registered users grew 40 percent to 27.6 million in 2007 and total paying members rose 39 percent to more than 305,000. Revenue grew 59 percent to 2.16 billion yuan in 2007, compared with 1.36 billion yuan the previous year, mainly due to an increase in paying members and average spending per paying member.
