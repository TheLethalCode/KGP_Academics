<TITLE> Turk court says to decide on taking up case vs AKP </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ANKARA, March 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkey's top court said on Monday it would decide within 10 days whether to take up a request by state prosecutors to close the ruling AK Party in a case that has upset investors and stoked fears of instability. A state prosecutor urged the Constitutional Court last Friday to close the party and ban 71 AK officials including the prime minister and president from politics for five years for allegedly trying to build an Islamic state in secular Turkey. The AK Party, which has roots in political Islam, strongly denies the accusations by the Court of Appeals prosecutor. The lawsuit has raised the prospect of prolonged political turmoil, including delays in vital economic and other reforms sought by the European Union and Turkey's business community. Turkey's political woes, combined with renewed global fears of recession in the United States, helped lop 4 percent off the lira currency and seven percent off share prices on Monday. "The Constitutional Court is now in the process of naming a rapporteur (to examine) the case. The first investigation will not take more than 10 days," Osman Paksut, deputy chief judge and spokesman for the court, told reporters. This first probe is technical and will only decide whether the dossier has been presented according to relevant rules. Once the court has agreed to examine the case, it will have to determine whether the accusations themselves are sufficiently serious and plausible to be investigated. If it does, the AK Party will then have to provide arguments in its own defence. A final verdict could take many months. The indictment is the latest shot in a long-running battle between Erdogan's AK Party and a secular elite, including judges, university rectors and army generals, which believes the government is eroding the separation of state and religion. MUSLIM HEADSCARF Secularists point as an example to parliament's recent decision to ease a ban on female students wearing the Muslim headscarf on university campuses. They see the garment as a symbol of political Islam. But the EU, the United States and top Turkish businessmen have joined Erdogan and his ministers in criticising the lawsuit as an affront to democracy. Their strong reaction prompted the Court of Appeals on Monday to issue a statement saying prosecutors had acted within their rights and that criticism should not turn into insults. Pro-AK Party commentators have dubbed the lawsuit a "judicial coup", inviting comparison with past army coups against Turkish governments. The army, with public support, ousted a government it deemed too Islamist as recently as 1997. "Now the bureaucratic empire in Ankara attacks the representatives of the people with legal decisions, not armed battalions," wrote Mustafa Akyol, a pro-AK Party columnist in the English language Turkish Daily News. "The heart of the matter is that Turkey's self-styled secularism is a fiercely anti-religious ideology akin to that of Marxist-Leninist tyrannies. And the AK Party has been trying to turn Turkey into a democracy, that's the party's real 'crime'." Erdogan, Gul and other top AK Party figures are pious Muslims whose wives wear the Islamic headscarf. They say they want to relax some of Turkey's strict curbs on religious expression but deny plans to dismantle the secular state. Erdogan was barred from politics once before for reciting a poem deemed too Islamist by Turkey's authorities. The AK Party began a closed-door meeting in parliament on Monday afternoon to discuss the indictment and how to fight it. Turkish newspapers have speculated that the AK Party, which has presided over strong economic growth and political reforms since taking power in 2002, could ask opposition parties to help push through constitutional changes to thwart the prosecutors. The changes would be aimed at making it more difficult to ban political parti
