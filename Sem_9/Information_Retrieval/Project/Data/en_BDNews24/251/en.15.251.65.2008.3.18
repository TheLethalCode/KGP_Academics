 MADRID, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Valencia defender Carlos Marchena has called upon critics to wait until the end of the season before passing judgement on coach Ronald Koeman. The Dutchman replaced Quique Sanchez Flores at the beginning of November but has been under fire from fans and media as the side slipped out of the Primera Liga title race and European competition. On Thursday, they host Barcelona at the Mestalla for the second leg of their King's Cup semi-final which is balanced at 1-1. With the side 10th in the league and nine points off the UEFA Cup places, making the King's Cup final is probably their best way of rescuing something from a disappointing season and their easiest route back into Europe. "At the end of the season we shall see whether Koeman has done well or not," the Spain international told a news conference on Tuesday. "He has his own methods and now is not the moment to criticise his work. The dressing room needs to stick together and take stock at the end of the season. "For my part I am worried about what happens to Koeman because he is my coach." Marchena was making reference to striker David Villa's words from Monday, when his Spanish international colleague was asked whether he though Koeman's future was at stake in Thursday's game. Villa said: "It's not my problem and it doesn't worry me. I concentrate on training hard to be able to do my best during games and it is others who have to decide what they have to decide." Argentine midfielder Ever Banega returned to the Valencia squad after missing Saturday's 2-1 home defeat to Sevilla in the league, but winger Vicente missed out with injury. Serbia striker Nikola Zigic was left out for technical reasons
