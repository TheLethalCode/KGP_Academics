<TITLE> UN`s Ban sees chance for deal to reunite Cyprus </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 United Nations, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on Monday there might a chance to reunite the divided island of Cyprus and urged UN member states to take advantage of the opportunity. "I think the international community should seize the momentum and window of opportunity when Mr Christofias, the new Cyprus president, was elected and is committed to a resolution of this issue," Ban told reporters after a meeting with the U.N. Security Council. Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded in response to a brief coup by Greek Cypriot extremists at the urging of the military then ruling Greece. The division of the Mediterranean island is an obstacle to Turkey's bid to join the European Union. Greek Cypriot leader Demetris Christofias, who won a presidential election last month, will meet Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat on Friday in a part of the island by administered by the United Nations. Ban said that he was sending Deputy Undersecretary-General for Political Affairs B. Lynn Pascoe, to Cyprus to "engage in dialogue with all stakeholders." But Cyprus's foreign minister, Markos Kyprianou, played down expectations before the meeting. "Yes there is a window of opportunity ... but we should not be over-optimistic. One could say we are cautiously optimistic, but we should not exaggerate the expectations," he told Reuters in an interview in Nicosia. "The window of opportunity is there, but it depends on the political will on both sides. From our side the political will is there." Reunification talks stalled in 2004 when Greek Cypriots rejected a U.N. blueprint for a settlement, which had been accepted by the Turkish Cypriots. Christofias said last week that progress would not be made if Talat stuck to that agreement.
