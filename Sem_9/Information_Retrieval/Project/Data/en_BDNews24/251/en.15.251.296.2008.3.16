 Dhaka, March 16 (bdnews24.com)  A group of Dhaka University students Sunday gave the government until March 29 to change quotas for the Bangladesh Civil Service and other governmental services. It said it would lay siege to the Public Service Commission from April 10 if the government failed to carry out the changes. The call for action came Sunday from the convener of a newfound outfit, the Quota Reform Movement, KM Selim, at a press conference at the Dhaka University Reporters' Association office. "The movement will spread onto the streets with the involvement of teachers, students and the public if the government fails to spell out a rational formula for amending quota systems for the BCS and other government services," he said. Under the current BCS competitive examination system, a quota of 30 percent of places is reserved for the children of freedom fighters and 10 percent for women. A further 10 percent is reserved for the districts and 5 percent for indigenous people. A committee comprising Regulatory Reforms Commission chairman Akbar Ali Khan and former education secretary Kazi M Rakibuddin was formed to review the quota system. Leaders of the movement allege that the government is delaying publication of a report on the quota system already submitted by the committee. Ainul Haque Anik, joint convenor of the movement, said: "Students of all public and private universities including Dhaka University have supported our demands." "Teachers, intellectuals, lawyers and other professional groups have also expressed their solidarity with the movement," said Anik. The movement has decided to not to go for action until April 10 in view of the 44th convocation scheduled for April 5-6, said joint convenor of the movement, Zakir Hossain. The movement was formed on Jan 29. bdnews24
