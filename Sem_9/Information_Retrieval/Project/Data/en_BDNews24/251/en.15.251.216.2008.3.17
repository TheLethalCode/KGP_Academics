 Dhaka, March 17 (bdnews24.com)The hearing on the caretaker government's appeal against a High Court verdict that quashed businessman Azam J Chowdhury's extortion case against Sheikh Hasina entered its second day Monday. A full bench of the Appellate Division, headed by chief justice Md Ruhul Amin, heard the appeal. Security measures were heightened in and around the Supreme Court premises ahead of the hearing which began Sunday, with body-searches carried out at all entrances. On Feb 26, the Appellate Division allowed the government to appeal against the verdict that quashed Chowdhury's extortion case after declaring its inclusion under emergency powers rules illegal. Counsel for the state, additional attorney general Salauddin Ahmed, said: "The emergency powers rules were proclaimed to save the country." The court asked if it was not a basic right of a citizen to be granted bail, to which Salauddin responded: "No it is not, and it should not be." The state's counsel said the emergency powers rules did not transgress the basic civil rights enshrined in the nation's constitution. Azam J Chowdhury filed the case on June 13 with Gulshan Police Station against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and her cousin Sheikh Selim. Hasina's sister, Sheikh Rehana, was also subsequently named in the charge sheet. According to case details, the accused took a total of Tk 2.99 crore from Chowdhury in 2001 in exchange for awarding him contracts to set up the Siddhirganj Power Plant. Hasina was arrested on July 16, 2007, the same day the case was included under the emergency powers rules. Sheikh Hasina lawyers, barristers Rafiq Ul Haque, Shafique Ahmed, Azmalul Hossain QC and Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh, and attorney general barrister Fida M Kamal were also present at Monday's hearing. bdnews24.
