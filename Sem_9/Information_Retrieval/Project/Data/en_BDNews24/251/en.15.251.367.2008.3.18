The spokesman described the incident, near the Old City's Damascus Gate, a busy area of Palestinian shops and cafes, as politically motivated.

On Sunday, dozens of right-wing Israeli activists hurled stones at cars and houses in the Arab neighbourhood in East Jerusalem where the gunman, who was killed by an off-duty army officer during the assault on the seminary, had lived. Israel annexed East Jerusalem after capturing it in the 1967 Middle East and considers all of the city its capital, a claim that has not been recognised internationally.
