 Dhaka, March 17 (bdnews24.com) -- Jute and textile mills workers Monday asked the government to resume the operations of jute mills that the authorities had ordered shut by laying off thousands of employees. At a seminar on what to be done to protect the jute industry, speakers stressed immediate allocation of funds to purchase jute from farmers to stop it being smuggled out of the country. Shafiuddin Ahmed, joint convener of the Action Council of Jute-Yarn-Textile Mill Workers, made an 18-point recommendation, which included making laws on the use of jute and ensuring due prices for growers. Rashed Khan Menon, president of the Workers Party of Bangladesh, said: "Jute farming began in March. The government must take immediate measures to allocate funds for the purchase of jute by the end of June. Otherwise jute will be smuggled into India." Menon asked the government to have discussion with the Action Council of Jute-Yarn-Textile Mill Workers. Communist Party chief Manjurul Ahsan Khan said: "We have to restore democracy to solve other problems." Khan said the country needed to have people's government instead of a government backed by the World Bank and IMF to save the jute industry. Professor Muzaffer Ahmad said: "We need to explore the multi-faceted use of jute and expand the domestic market for it." Former jute secretary Salahuddin Ahmed said: "In order to revitalise the economy, efforts must be made to enhance the domestic jute industry. Steps must be taken with determination to establish local and international markets for jute." Former general manager of Adamji Jute Mills Mazharul Kuddus said: "Those who say there is no future for jute are ignorant. The jute industry needs the government's support." bdnews24
