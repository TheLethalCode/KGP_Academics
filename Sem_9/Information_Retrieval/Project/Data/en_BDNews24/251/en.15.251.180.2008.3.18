 Moscow, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - No agreement has been reached between the United States and Russia on Washington's plans to deploy a missile defence system in eastern Europe or on the future of a key nuclear arms control treaty, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Tuesday. Speaking after talks with U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Lavrov said no agreement had yet been reached "and I mean first and foremost on the missile shield plan and the future of the START treaty after it expires next year".
