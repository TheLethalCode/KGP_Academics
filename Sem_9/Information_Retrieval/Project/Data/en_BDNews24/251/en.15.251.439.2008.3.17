 Dhaka, March 17 (bdnews24.com) The special court, set up on the Sangsad Bhaban premises, has not been officially notified of Sheikh Hasina's transfer to Square Hospital, Judge Md Firoz Alam said Monday. Judge Alam of Special Judge's Court-1 deferred further proceedings Monday morning of a graft case filed against Hasina involving the setting up of three barge mounted power plants. Proceedings were adjourned until March 23, as the former prime minister was unable to appear in court. Sheikh Hasina's lawyer Quamrul Islam told the court at the very outset of the day's proceedings: "We are not being informed of Sheikh Hasina's wellbeinghow she's faring at the hospital, her health status, nothing at all." Judge Alam replied: "I don't have it on record here that Sheikh Hasina has been admitted to Square Hospital. On March 13, I was informed that she was ill." "I've been sent this loose information sheet only this morning signed by the hospital and jailer Farukh Ahmed from Dhaka Central Jail, which says that she's been admitted to Square Hospital." "It's the court who decides where an accused should be kept and under what conditions, till the charges are substantiated," said the judge. "In case the accused is to be shifted for medical treatment, the court has to be notified of the transfer. But I wasn't informed in this case." Judge Alam said the court will issue necessary orders to the relevant authorities to officially inform all concerned as to what steps have so far been taken with regard to Hasina's treatment, what her present condition is, who may visit her and other related matters. Advocate Quamrul further complained to the court that prison authorities had summoned Hasina's lawyers on Sunday, kept them waiting for two and a half hours but then did not allow them to see the detained AL president. "They are only citing excuses in the name of treating her. They are not allowing anyone to know about her real health condition," the lawyer said. As doctors suggested, Sheikh Hasina was shifted from the special jail on the Sangsad Bhaban grounds and admitted to Square Hospital on March 11. bdnews24.
