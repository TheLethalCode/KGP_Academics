<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 18 (bdnews24.com)  Speaker Muhammad Jamiruddin Sircar has asked the government to arrange polls immediately and warned that people's patience is wearing thin over the delay in a parliamentary election. At a memorial meeting on the first death anniversary of BNP standing committee member KM Obaidur Rahman Tuesday, the speaker said: "The government failed to hold the polls in three months' time (from the dissolution of parliament). People are getting impatient now. They want immediate elections." "An unelected government cannot do everything. That's why a 90-day timeframe is fixed to hold the polls. It's democracy that can solve all problems," Sircar said. He urged the leaders and workers of the BNP to unite under the leadership of party chairperson Khaleda Zia, now detained in special jail on corruption charges. Sircar discounted "infighting" in the BNP cleaved by the two factionsone led by former finance minister M Saifur Rahman and the other led by Khandaker Delwar Hossain. Khaleda is the leader for both Delwar and Hafizuddin Ahmed, who belongs in the Saifur group, he said. "So where is the conflict? BNP is united. All will have to come back to the mainstream after election schedules are announced," Sircar said. Referring to the late Obaidur Rahman, Sircar said he had also come to the party ahead of an election. "It's not possible to survive in politics straying away from the mainstream." The speaker termed parliament a centre of democracy and said only representatives of people could protect sovereignty of the country. bdnew
