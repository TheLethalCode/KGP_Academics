 MOSCOW, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia and the United States struck an optimistic note on Tuesday before talks that are likely to be tough on nuclear arms control, NATO expansion and US plans to build a missile defence shield. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Defense Secretary Robert Gates were due to hold talks with their Russian counterparts after meeting President Vladimir Putin and president-elect Dmitry Medvedev on Monday. "We had a positive start yesterday and we look forward to further work today ... so that perhaps we can strengthen our partnership and overcome some of our differences and we can underscore the many agreements we have," she said. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Monday's discussions had "set the right tone". "We are satisfied with the way our relationships are developing," Lavrov said ahead of talks that also involve Russian Defence Minister Anatoly Serdyukov. Former Cold War foes Russian and the United States differ sharply over the missile shield, Kosovo's independence from Russian ally Serbia, and the war in Iraq although they have cooperated on sanctions against Iran and North Korea. Gates said on Monday a deal might be reached on the missile shield, which Russia sees as a threat to its security,-- before U.S. President George W. Bush's term ends in January 2009. Putin said on Monday he saw a chance to improve relations with the United States after receiving what he called a serious document from Bush. That document, a letter from Bush, laid out long-term topics for discussion and could set the stage for an agreement on the basis of a relationship for subsequent Russian and U.S. leaders, U.S. officials said. Similar meetings in the past between U.S. and Russian foreign and defence ministers have yielded little progress on the main problems. When pressed, Gates said he was cautious about the potential gain. "These are big issues and a lot of problems need to be solved," he said. Russian newspapers were equally cautious. "It looks like both sides confirm their readiness for talks across the whole strategic agenda," the daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta said. "But at the same time they do not rush to demonstrate any changes in their positions." SHIELD BREAKTHROUGH? The visit by Gates and Rice, their second to Russia in five months, was mainly intended to find a way out of the dispute over US plans to place parts of a missile defence system in Poland and the Czech Republic, once Soviet-allied territory. The two sides are also likely to discuss how to continue nuclear arms control efforts and the possibility of NATO taking in Ukraine and Georgia, two former Soviet republics which Moscow considers part of its sphere of influence. NATO will consider Ukrainian and Georgian membership at a summit in Bucharest on April 2-4. Putin has been invited to the meeting. The disagreements over big issues have damaged US-Russian diplomatic relations although but not hurt economic cooperation. Mutual trade was $17.5 billion last year, up from $15 billion in 2006, and US companies have been investing heavily in Russia. Despite Russian opposition, Washington says the missile shield is needed as protection against the growing capabilities of what it calls rogue states, a reference to Iran. The two sides are also likely to discuss how to replace the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), a Cold War-era pact limiting long-range nuclear weapons which expires next year. Washington is resisting Russian pressure to sign up to a fully fledged successor to START, but Rice has signalled the United States could be prepared to consider a slimmed-down treaty to replace
