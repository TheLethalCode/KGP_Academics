 Dhaka, March 19 (bdnews24.com) An ancient statue depicting two Hindu goddesses, recently retrieved from Gulshan, was handed over to officials of the archaeology directorate Wednesday morning. After handing over the relic to director of the archaeology directorate Dr Shafiqul Alam, Rab-1 battalion commander Lt Col Fayed Saklain told reporters: "The statue was found on March 12, on the pavement near a vacant plot beside a house on Road 91 in Gulshan-2." The 18-inch tall black statue weighs 24 kgs and on its two faces are sculpted the goddesses Swaraswati and Radha. Rab-1 notified the archaeology directorate of their find immediately after the recovery of the statue. The archaeologists examined the ancient figure and ascertained that it was a genuine artefact dating back from the regime of the Sen dynasty that ruled Bengal during the 10th and 11th centuries, Saklain said. Dr Alam thanked Rab-1 for handing over the rare artefact. Saklain said an investigation was on to identify and round up possible relic hunters and traffickers involved in the case. bdnews24.
