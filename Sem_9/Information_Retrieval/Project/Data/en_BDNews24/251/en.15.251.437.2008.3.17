<TEXT>
 Cairo, March 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least 15 Egyptians were killed and 20 injured on Sunday when a police transport truck loaded with conscripts collided with a truck on a highway to Alexandria, a security source said. The source said the conscripts were likely headed to a police camp on the desert road leading to the coastal city. The cause of the accident was not immediately known, but the source said the crash was a head-on collision. Reckless driving, lax traffic rules and poor road conditions cause many road crashes in Egypt. A series of road and rail accidents over the past few years triggered a public outcry over the government's handling of road and transport safety.
