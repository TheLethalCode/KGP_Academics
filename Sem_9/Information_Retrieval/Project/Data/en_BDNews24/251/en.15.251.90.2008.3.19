<TITLE> William Radice predicts brighter days for Bangla </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 18 (bdnews24.com)Not Kolkata of West Bengal, but Bangladesh will be a centre of excellence in the practice of Bangla, says William Radice, a scholar of Bangla language and literature. People in Kolkata are now heading for Mumbai or New Delhi. Children of middle-class families are going to English medium schools. "Why do you have to speak Bangla anyway?" Radice says he is probably fated to do so. "Probably I was a Bangalee in my previous life," he says jokingly. A poet and a scholar, Radice, some say, is the finest translator of Rabindranath Tagore's works. Radice is the senior lecturer in Bangla in the School of Oriental and African Studies, a college of the University of London. He delivered a lecture on "Bangla in globalisation", organised by the School of Liberal Arts at the Independent University of Bangladesh on Tuesday. Radice predicts that Bangla100 years down the linewill find its place among leading languages in the world. "This is one of the major modern languages, but it could not be a language for all because of negligence," he says. Radice refers to the rise of Bangladesh as a country, thanks to the value of language through its 1952 movement and the 1971 War of Independence. Bangla has its own identity with a long, rich literary tradition. "By all standards, it's a rich language." Radice stresses more organised support from the government. "Many universities and language institutes in Europe and America are now working on the Bangla language," he says. Radice suggests that Bangla-speaking Nobel laureates Amartya Sen and Muhammad Yunus should properly represent the language on the world stage. "Translation of Tagore's works with online editions is crucial for spreading the language. The songs must be translated, with their themes undistorted," he says. Radice came to Dhaka on Mar 15 on a weeklong visit at the invitation of the British Council. bdnews
