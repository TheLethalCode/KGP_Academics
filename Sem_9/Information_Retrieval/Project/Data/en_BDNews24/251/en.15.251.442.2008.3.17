 New Delhi, March 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian police arrested at least 40 people in an overnight crackdown on suspected drug dealers and other criminals in Goa following a rash of attacks on tourists, a top police officer said on Monday. Scarlett Keeling, a 15-year-old British girl, was raped and murdered last month prompting criticism of the police for failing to protect her and others visiting the popular tourist destination. A German woman was molested in a beach last week, police said. "I will be ruthless, no one can take Goa for granted," Kishan Kumar, the Inspector general of police told Reuters on Monday, referring to the drive against criminals. "Anybody lurking in the beaches after midnight with suspicious intent will have to face lot of questioning from now on". Keeling's case also highlighted the safety of tourists in India and the easy availability of drugs, especially in Anjuna beach, famous for drug and booze parties, and where Keeling's body was eventually found. Two people have been arrested in the case so far. Police said that Keeling was raped and then left to die. At least 126 foreign nationals have died in Goa in the past two years, 40 of them British, officials said. On Monday, the Goa police also claimed a further breakthrough in the Keeling case after a key witness in the case, Michael Manyon, contacted them. "Manyon, who can identify the person who dragged Keeling out of the shack and saw what happened is turning himself in for questioning," Vikram Varma, Keeling's lawyer said from Goa. Police said Keeling was dragged out of the shack after her attackers gave her alcohol, along with ecstasy, LSD and cocaine. The Indian media have severely criticised the police for not doing enough to protect tourists and the Indian government now say they could employ ex-military personnel to protect tourists in beaches around the country.
