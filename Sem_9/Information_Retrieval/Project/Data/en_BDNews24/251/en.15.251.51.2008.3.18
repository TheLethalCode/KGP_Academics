 Dhaka, March 18 (bdnews24.com)  Country's leading footballers Tuesday decided not to join the national camp for the upcoming AFC Challenge Cup and SAFF Championship following the postponement of the player transfers. "We will refrain from joining the national camp and any kind of football under the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) until the completion of the footballer transfers," said Alfaz Ahmed. Country's football governing body Monday postponed the ongoing inter-club player transfers until the BFF poll by April after having discussed the matter with the eight Dhaka clubs including giants Mohammedan, Abahani, Brothers and Muktijoddha. The footballer bourse opened on March 14 and was to have continued till April 14, two days before the start of the second edition professional football league. But the BFF high-ups said they had postponed the transfers on request of the clubs that told them they have been in financial constraints. It also said that two upcoming national assignments - AFC Challenge Cup and SAFF Championship -- and Abahani's participation in the AFC President Club this month also prompted them to suspend the transfer process. Alfaz said, "We don't want to sit with the BFF officials again as we had earlier discussed the matter with them, and from now on, we will follow them with regard to measures they take in favour of us." Drawing the attention to footballers' decision ahead of the AFC Challenge Cup and the SAFF Football, BFF president SA Sultan said, "We will soon discuss the matter with them and I am confident that they will join the national camp in the interest of the country."
