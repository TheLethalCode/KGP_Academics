 Islamabad, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The leader of Pakistan's lawyers' movement threatened nationwide protests if the Supreme Court sides with President Pervez Musharraf on Tuesday by stalling the new parliament's plan to reinstate judges he fired. "The court is not competent to interfere in parliament's proceedings," Aitzaz Ahsan, a lawyer and former cabinet minister, told a news conference late on Monday. "This would be a negation of the democratic process," he said on the eve of a session of the Supreme Court, believed to have been hastily called to put a stay order on parliament to prevent it passing a resolution to bring back the old judges. Musharraf used emergency powers in November to purge the Supreme Court of judges he feared would rule his re-election unconstitutional. Ten judges, including the chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, have been under house arrest since then, while 50 more refused to serve under Musharraf after he suspended the constitution. Ahsan, the President of the Supreme Court Bar Association, was also put under house arrest, but was released on March 2. Musharraf subsequently packed the courts with judges he could rely on to strike down challenges to his re-election and validate his actions under six weeks of emergency rule. The defeat of pro-Musharraf parties in a parliamentary election on Feb. 18 left the president, who came to power as a general in a coup in 1999, even more isolated. Western allies and neighbours are hoping the election will lead to a measure of stability in a nuclear-armed state already threatened from within by al Qaeda-inspired Islamist militants. General Ashfaq Kayani, who took over as army chief from Musharraf in November, has indicated the military will remain neutral in political affairs. U.S. officials have in the past lauded Musharraf's value as an ally in the global "war on terror", but have become more circumspect since the tide turned against the Pakistani leader. CHAUDHRY TO KEEP POWDER DRY The judges Musharraf appointed in November represent one of the few lines of defence available to the beleaguered president. Ahsan said he anticipated the Supreme Court would place a stay order on parliament preventing it from passing a resolution to bring about the reinstatement of the old judges, as the victors of the Feb. 18 election pledged to do this month. Lawyers will boycott the courts the next day and begin a campaign of peaceful protests if the Supreme Court tries to block parliament, Ahsan said. Lawyers launched a campaign of street protests last year to defend the independence of the judiciary after Musharraf first suspended Chaudhry a year ago. The Supreme Court reinstated him in July, before Musharraf resorted to emergency rule on Nov. 3. The new judges are also expected to say that a two-thirds majority would be needed in parliament to restore the old judges, but Ahsan said parliament should ignore the court. Asif Ali Zardari, husband of assassinated former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, and Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister Musharraf deposed, said the resolution should be passed within 30 days of the National Assembly convening. The Assembly met for the first time on Monday, starting the countdown to April 16. Zardari's Pakistan People's Party will lead the incoming coalition, while Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), known as the PML-N, will be the second largest partner. They have yet to settle on a prime minister, and the new government has still to be sworn in. Once it is, Chaudhry and the other judges should be released from house arrest. There has been speculation that Chaudhry would go straight to the Supreme Court to reclaim his position, but Ahsan said that would not happen during the 30-day period. "Even on release the chief justice will not proceed to the Supreme Court, as long as the countdown continues," Ahsan said.
