<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 16 (bdnews24.com)  The Appellate Division Sunday started hearing a government appeal against a High Court verdict that quashed Azam Jahangir Chowdhury's extortion case against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina. A full Appellate Division bench headed by chief justice Md Ruhul Amin began hearing the appeal at 9:30am. The hearing will continue Monday. Additional attorney general Salahuddin Ahmed said in the hearing that the High Court handed down the case cancellation verdict on purpose, as Hasina in her writ petition had only contended that inclusion of the case for trial under the emergency powers rules was illegal. He said the enforcement of the state of emergency was proper and right as per the constitution. The constitution, Ahmed said, spoke of ensuring quick and just trial. The Hasina case had been taken under the emergency powers rules legally to ensure quick justice. The emergency powers rules had been formulated under the Emergency Powers Ordinance and so long as the rules were in force as a recognised law under the constitution the High Court verdict was completely illegal, the court heard. Ahmed said granting bail under the law when the emergency powers rules were in force was completely against the rule and outside the jurisdiction of the High Court. The inclusion of the case under the emergency powers rules was proper and in line with constitution, he contended. Barrister Rafique-ul-Huq, barrister Shafique Ahmed and barrister Sheikh Fazle Noor Tapash representing Hasina were present in the court during hearing. The Appellate Division on Feb 26 stayed the High Court's dismissal of the case after accepting the government's leave to appeal petition against the verdict and set March 16 for hearing the appeal. Security inside the court and around was tightened Sunday over the hearing. Security personnel were frisking everybody at the entrances to the apex court. The government filed a motion with the Appellate Division on Feb 18 seeking leave to appeal the High Court verdict. On Feb 6, the High Court dismissed the extortion case after ruling illegal its inclusion under the emergency powers rules. The ruling came on a writ petition filed by Hasina challenging the case's trial under the rules. Azam J Chowdhury filed the Tk 3 crore extortion case against Hasina and her cousin former health minister Sheikh Selim with Gulshan Police Station on June 13, 2007. According to case details, the accused received a total of Tk 2.99 crore from the litigant in 2001 in exchange for illegally awarding a contract to build Siddhirganj Power Station. Chowdhury later denied having named Hasina in the case, saying he had struck no deal with the Awami League chief. Hasina was arrested on July 16, 2007 and shown arrested in the case later the same day after inclusion of the case proceedings under the emergency powers rules. Charges were framed against the accused, including Hasina's sister Sheikh Rehana on Jan 13. bdnews24
