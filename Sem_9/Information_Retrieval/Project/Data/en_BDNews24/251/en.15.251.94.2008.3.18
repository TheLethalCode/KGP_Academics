<TITLE> Russia to resume flights to Georgia from March 25 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Moscow, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia said on Tuesday it would resume passenger flights to Georgia later this month after Moscow cut them in November 2006 during a political row. "Russia's aviation authorities have informed the Georgian side of their consent to resume the Russian Federation's air links with Georgia from March 25," Russia's transport ministry said in a statement. Ties between the two ex-Soviet states dipped to nearly an all-time low in late 2006 after Georgia arrested several suspected Russian spies. Moscow retaliated by cutting all railway, aviation and postal links with the country. But following Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili's re-election in January this year, both countries have struck a friendlier tone.
