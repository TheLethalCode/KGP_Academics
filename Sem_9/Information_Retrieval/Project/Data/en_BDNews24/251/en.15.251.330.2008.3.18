<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 18 (bdnews24.com)  Title contenders Abahani Limited extended their unbeaten run in the Premier Division Cricket league with a massive 150-win over Kalabagan KC at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium Tuesday. City Club handed a tense four-run defeat to Old DOHS at the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan ground while Partex SC tasted first win defeating Young Pegasus by 65 runs at Dhanmondi Cricket Stadium. Abahani vs Kalabagan Opener Mahbubul Karim struck a fine 89 as Abahani posted a challenging total of 268 for eight in 50 overs after being put in to bat first. Karim along with Jahirul Islam (27) gave a fine 67-run opening partnership and added another 90 runs with Shagir Hossain (35) for the third wicket before he was the third man out, leaving the side 181 for three in 34.4 overs. Later, two quickfires from Mohammad Rafique (30 off 21 balls) and Nadif Chowdhury (30 off 37 balls) helped the Dhanmondi-based outfit go beyond the 250-mark. In reply, Kalabagan found themselves in a difficult position in the face of superb bowling from pacers Nazmul Hossain (3/14), Talha Jubaer (2/18) and Ziaur Rahman (1/18) to be reduced to 30 for five and never healed the wound. Later, spinners Tushar Imran (2/3) and Rafique (1/34) wiped up the middle and tail to end Kalabagan's innings at 118 all out in 39.2 overs though national discard Syed Rasel struck a fine 52. City vs DOHS Put in to bat first, City Club managed 204 for nine in 50 overs as Mahbubul Alam (3/34) and Monir Ahmed (3/46) wrecked the opponent innings despite a decent start from City's top order batsmen. Imran Ahmed (40) and Robiul Karim (14) laid a solid foundation and Golam Mabud smashed 65, but the middle and late order failed to keep the momentum in face of some tight bowling. DOHS, in reply, also fell into trouble wobbling at nine for two before opener Rajin Saleh (64) and Mehrab Hossain Junior (68) took their side to 102 before being separated 32.2 overs. But, the two- time champions, DOHS, suddenly slipped to 148 for seven in 42 overs to go on the back foot and never recovered the hole though Monir Hossain played a 21-ball 23 raising hopes of a win. All efforts went in vain after Monir was run out as the last batsman and DOHS stopped at 200 all out with three balls to go. Partex vs Pegasus Pegasus were bundled out for 112 in 38.4 overs, chasing Partex's paltry total of 177 all out in 46.3 overs. Sent in to bat first, Pegasus came out successfully after bowling Partex out cheaply with spinner Sabbir Hossain leading the attack with three for 23. Arif Mehmood and Nazmul Islam also took two wickets each to put their contribution as Ariful Islam topscored with 44 followed by Pratik Shah Dip on 37. Chasing the gettable total, the Pegasus batsmen returned to the dressing room at regular intervals as Mahfuzur Rahman (2/14), Rezaul Haq (2/25) and Omar Faruk (2/16) wiped their innings.
