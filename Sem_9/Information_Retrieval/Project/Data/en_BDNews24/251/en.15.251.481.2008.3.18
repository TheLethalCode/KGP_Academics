 Prodip Chowdhury bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, March 18 (bdnews24.com)Ten special judge's courts in the Sangsad Bhaban area have been given judicial powers to conduct criminal cases, the law ministry said in a circular Tuesday. The courts earlier assigned to deal with only corruption cases will now be able to try murder, rape, extortion and arms cases under the CrPC (Criminal Procedure Code). The special judge's courts sited in the Sangsad Bhaban will be called special courts of sessions, according to the circular. A court official said the extortion case against BNP senior joint secretary general Tarique Rahman and other high-profile cases including the one of murder against former state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar could start in any of the 10 courts. As the special judge's courts did not have judicial powers except for corruption cases, the trial of the case by businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina had started in the metropolitan sessions judge's court. For the trial of Hasina, a special courtroom was set up in the Sangsad Bhaban premises. Five special judge's courts started functioning in the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban on May 6 last year for speedy trial of the corruption suspect cases. Later, four more courts started work there. At present, nine special judge's courts are functioning in the Sangsad Bhaban area. The room for another is ready, but not yet functioning. bdnew
