 MADRID, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ronaldinho is not injured but is to follow a specific programme to recover from his "medical problems", Barcelona's medical services have said. The Brazil forward missed the 2-2 draw away to Almeria in the Primera Liga on Sunday, with coach Frank Rijkaard saying the player was left out of the squad because he was injured. The 27-year-old playmaker only trained for six minutes on Monday before leaving the club's training pitches. "As a result of a persistent problem in the adductor muscle of the right leg the player has had a scan which revealed there is no muscle or tendon injury," Barca's medical services said in a statement on the club's Web site (www.fcbarcelona.com). "The player will receive specific treatment to solve the medical problems that remain." No time period was given for how long Ronaldinho would be laid low. Barcelona visit Valencia for their King's Cup semi-final, second leg on Thursday, with the tie level at 1-1. Ronaldinho is a doubt but Portugal midfielder Deco is definitely ruled out with a calf strain. "The player will work on a specific recovery plan to be ready for the Champions League quarter-final match against Schalke 04," the statement said. The first leg is in Gelsenkirchen on April 1
