"Until such time as those three come into service we're extremely vulnerable." He said mining companies were aware of the situation. South Africa's electricity grid came close to collapse in January, forcing the government to declare a national emergency. Gold and platinum mines were forced to shut down for five days. Since then mines have been operating below full power, driving up precious metals prices and raising fears of possible job losses and slowing growth.
