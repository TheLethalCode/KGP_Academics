 Dhaka, March 17 (bdnews24.com)  Local AL leaders expressed their disappointment to the party's central leaders Monday as to why initiatives were not being taken for the release of party chief Sheikh Hasina. AL presidium members including Amir Hossain Amu, Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed and Kazi Zafarullah laid flowers at the grave of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in Tungipara on Monday in observance of his 88th birth anniversary. Gopalganj AL president Sheikh Mohammad Yusuf Ali told the central leaders: "We want our party leader to be released. We do not want her pushed towards death." Tungipara AL president Nayeb Ali said: "Sheikh Hasina is in jail. We should save her, we should release her." He asked the party's central leaders: "Why are you sitting inactive without taking up any programme for her freedom?" "We can't save her if we sit idle." Other local party leaders echoed the same sentiments. Replying to their comments, presidium member Abdur Razzak said: "We are demanding the release of our party president whenever we get the chance. We are constantly considering means for her release." Tofail Ahmed said: "We will hold discussions with district party leaders after March 26 to take the next steps." Later, the AL presidium members joined in remembrance prayers at the Bangabandhu Memorial Complex Mosque. Amir Hossain Amu, prior to joining the milad told reporters: "There is no divide within Awami League. We are united and we will get the leader freed from jail." Acting AL general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam also told reporters: "We will work together and get our leader freed." Razzak added: "We won't accept any conspiracy on elections. The polls must be held in line with the roadmap. We will build our 'golden Bangla' through the leadership of Sheikh Hasina after her release." Members of the party's associate organisations, including Jubo League, Mohila Awami League and Chhatra League, also offered flowers at the Bangabandhu Memorial Complex. bdnews24
