 Brussels, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Commission said it made progress in talks with Russia on Tuesday over Moscow's long-standing bid to join the World Trade Organisation but differences remained on the key issue of Russia's export duties. European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson met Russian Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin to try to make headway on the bid, to which Brussels has yet to give its final clearance. Approval has been stalled by a dispute over Russian export duties on timber that hurt paper and pulp producers in Nordic EU states, especially Finland. "The meeting today was important as Mandelson and Kudrin were able to make their points clearly to one another in a frank and constructive way, which moved the negotiations forward," the Commission said in a statement. Russia's duties on exports of timber add to costs for Swedish and Finnish paper companies such as Stora Enso , the world's biggest paper producer, UPM-Kymmene and M-Real . The duties are due to rise on April 1 and the Bank of Finland has warned they could lead to job cuts and lower national economic output. About 20 percent of raw wood used by Finnish paper mills comes from Russia. Both sides reaffirmed their common commitment to Russia's "early accession" to the WTO, the Commission's statement said. "Concluding the meeting, the two sides tasked their negotiators with continuing discussions with a view to solving the issue of export duties in a mutually satisfactory manner as soon as possible," the statement added. Russia also has to get final clearance for its WTO bid from other countries including the United States.
