 Dhaka, March 18 (bdnews24.com)  Women-rights campaigners Tuesday asked the caretaker government to ensure that 33 percent of positions in the parliament, government and political parties are reserved for women. The demands came from a roundtable discussion on "Women in Bangladeshi politics", organised by Mahila Parishad, a women-rights organisation , and Weekly 2000 at the National Press Club. Representatives from mainstream political parties participated in the discussion, attended as chief guest by women's affairs adviser Rasheda K Choudhury. The keynote speakers said women's participation in the political parties remained unacceptably low. The Awami League has only four female members in the 13-strong policymaking presidium and three secretaries out of 22. Only one member in the BNP's policymaking standing committee is a woman, while six secretaries out of 79 in the executive committee are female, they said. The 16-strong standing committee of Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal has only one female member. Jatiya Party's central committee has nine females among 305 members. Gano Forum has six women central committee members out of 94, while there are no female members in the Workers' Party politburo or the Communist Party of Bangladesh presidium, the roundtable was told. "We need to reach a national consensus on female issues beyond the political boundary, otherwise how can we fight fundamentalism?" Rasheda K Choudhury said. "The socio-political powers should be united to bring women into the mainstream," she added. Former education minister and BNP leader Osman Faruk said there should be an understanding among political parties to ensure opportunities for women in all sections of society and that the law should be amendment, if necessary. AL presidium member Tofael Ahmed said his party supported the Election Commission's proposal for reserving a 33 percent quota for women in the central committees of the political parties. Communist Party central committee secretary Mahbubul Alam said his party plans to amend its constitution to ensure it met the 33 percent target. bdnews24
