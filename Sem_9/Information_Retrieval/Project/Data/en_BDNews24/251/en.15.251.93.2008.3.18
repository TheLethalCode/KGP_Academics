<TITLE> Don't listen to DGFI, Prof Anwar asks AL </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 18 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka University Teachers' Association (DUTA) general secretary Prof Anwar Hossain Tuesday asked Awami League policymakers not to listen to military intelligence agency DGFI, which he said was part of a 'ghost government'. "A dual rule cannot continue in the country. No ghost government is acceptable. The caretaker government will run the country," Prof Anwar said, speaking at an AL-organised discussion on the 88th birth anniversary of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Addressing the AL leaders, he said: "There cannot be any contact with the ghost government. No contact with the DGFI." But none of the AL leaders responded to his remarks at the discussion held at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh auditorium. Prof Anwar urged the AL leaders to have courage like Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and roll out a programme for the release of detained party leader Sheikh Hasina. The remark drew sharp comments from policymaking presidium member Amir Hossain Amu. "The Awami League is not so poor that it has to borrow language from others for politics and movement. When it comes to such point, we will stop speaking. Many had tried before to stage revolutions but did not succeed," Amu said. Soon, he was barracked by party adherents who started chanting slogans for the release of Hasina. By the time another presidium member, Abdur Razzak, started delivering his speech, the activists were less sparing. A Jubo Mohila League worker interrupted him reminiscing about the independence leader, shouting, "We will hear from Sheikh Hasina." Razzak had however demanded proper treatment for Hasina at the start of his speech. The leaders and workers of AL's Dhaka city chapter protested at the corridor outside the auditorium as no leader of the unit was allowed to speak. Acting AL general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam and deputy publicity secretary Ashim Kumar Ukil tried to calm them, but they kept demanding Hasina's release. The agitated workers told Ashraful Islam to drive away 'the agents' from the podium. "We will hear no reform talks All must demand Sheikh Hasina's release," were some of the demands raised by the leaders and workers of the party's metropolitan unit. Later, the acting general secretary of the Dhaka city unit, Kamrul Islam, spoke. Addressing the top party leaders, he said, "[Hasina's] release is not possible through legal battles. There is no alternative to waging movement. Prepare a strategy. Be courageous like Bangabandhu [Sheikh Mujibur Rahman] and demand release of the leader." Prof Anwar then quoted Hasina as having said (before her arrest) that the intelligence agency should not run the country. "Sheikh Mujibur Rahman did not make a mistake in identifying the enemies, neither did Hasina." The Dhaka University teacher advised the AL leaders to ask for Hasina's release in 72 hours instead of demanding her treatment in 72 hours. The DUTA general secretary said people wearing military uniform and violating military rules were doing politics and detaining politicians. "People of [Bangladesh] will not forgive them. We want the army back to barrack." Prof Anwar demanded that national elections be held immediately. "We need elections in 3/4 months." Acting AL president Zillur Rahman, who presided over the discussion, said, "Only one person can save the country from this deep crisis. That person is Sheikh Hasina. The nation cannot get over this crisis if leadership is not given to her." bdnews
