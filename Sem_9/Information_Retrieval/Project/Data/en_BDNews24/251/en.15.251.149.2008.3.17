 Kandahar, Afghanistan, March 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide attack aimed at a NATO convoy in the southern Afghan province of Helmand killed at least three civilians on Monday, police said. A spokesman for British forces in Helmand said the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) had suffered casualties -- either dead or wounded -- but denied media reports that four British soldiers were killed in the attack. "That is completely untrue. As yet, all I can say is that there were ISAF casualties," Lieutenant Colonel Simon Miller said. "We are still waiting for confirmation of nationalities and types of casualties and I am not aware of four British soldiers being killed, that is wrong," he said. The attacker was in a car, but failed to hit the NATO convoy travelling in the Girishk district of Helmand, one of the areas where Taliban guerrillas are most active and the region which alone produces nearly half the world's opium, the Helmand police chief said. "Three civilians were martyred and seven more were wounded in the attack," police chief Mohammad Hussein Andiwal told Reuters. British soldiers form the bulk of the International Security Assistance Force in Helmand. Violence in Afghanistan has spiralled since the hardline Islamist Taliban relaunched their insurgency to topple the pro-Western Afghan government and eject foreign troops two years ago. The Taliban rely heavily on suicide and roadside bomb attacks, but as foreign forces use more heavily armed vehicles and are becoming better at avoiding casualties, a greater proportion of the victims are innocent Afghan civilians. More than 12,000 people, including some 350 foreign soldiers, have been killed since 2006 in Afghanistan, United Nations according to estimates. On Sunday night, one Canadian soldier was killed by an explosion in Kandahar, ISAF said.
