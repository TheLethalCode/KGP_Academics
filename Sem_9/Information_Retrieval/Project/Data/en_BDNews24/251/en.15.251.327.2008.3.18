 Sarajevo, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bosnia's war crimes court indicted on Tuesday a Bosnian Serb ex-soldier for the rape and illegal detention of Muslims in the eastern town of Foca early in the country's 1992-95 war. Miodrag Nikacevic, 44, is accused of crimes against humanity for raping two Muslim women in Foca, one of them a neighbour's daughter, in April and June 1992. "The accused came to his Muslim neighbour demanding that her daughter come to his apartment, purportedly to clean it and is then alleged to have raped her after she finished cleaning up his apartment," the court said in a statement. Nikacevic is also accused of taking part in the abduction and unlawful detention of a Muslim civilian in the Foca prison together with two other Bosnian Serb soldiers. The man was later taken from the prison and killed at an unknown location. The Bosnian war crimes court is currently trying several war crimes suspects from Foca, the scene of some of the worst atrocities in the war that claimed more than 100,000 lives. It was set up in 2005 to allow the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague to focus on the most serious abuses of the conflict and has convicted 14 suspects so far.
