<TITLE> L&G sees profit drop as Britons live longer </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UK insurer Legal & General missed forecasts with a 26 percent drop in 2007 profit, hit by a 269 million pound ($539 million) charge as British life expectancies increase faster than expected. L&G, the most domestic-focused of Britain's top insurers, also warned of a tough year ahead for UK savings, buffetted by market volatility and capital gains tax changes, but said its key protection business would outperform, as a new distribution deal with building society Nationwide offset a weaker housing market. L&G shares, however, rose almost 3 percent in early trade, as comfort on the outlook for its annuity and protection markets -- despite weak markets -- and a higher-than-expected new business profit helped offset the headline miss. Britain's third-largest life insurer said its 2007 operating profit, on a European embedded value (EEV) basis, was 912 billion pounds. That was below an average forecast, according to Reuters Estimates, of 1.1 billion and below the lower end of forecasts ranging from 941 million to 1.24 billion pounds. The operating number was hit by a higher than expected longevity charge, as the insurer followed peers including Prudential and Aviva, who in past weeks have also raised their assumptions of how quickly the average British age expectancy will rise, and took a 269 million provision to account for the extra cost. L&G is one of the largest UK providers of annuities, contracts which provide customers an income in retirement that continues until they die. "We have always expected them to live longer, but it is the rate of improvement which we are changing," Chief Executive Tim Breedon told reporters. On a statutory basis, operating profit more than halved to 658 million pounds, again hit by longevity changes but also by 84 million pounds of weather-related losses in its general insurance arm after last year's storms and floods which dented an increased contribution from the investment management arm. SHARES CLIMB Despite the drop in the operating line, L&G said the value of new business came in at 359 million pounds -- below 418 million a year ago but at the high end of expectations. Resilient margins in protection were offset by drop in unit-linked bonds, but the group comforted the market on worries over its key bulk annuity market, and said margins there were not expected to drop. That positive news helped offset the headline miss, with L&G shares, which trade at one of the sector's highest multiples, rising 2.4 percent at 0845 GMT to trade at 122.1p, outperforming a sector recovering from a hard fall on Monday. "Whilst Legal & General's full year results may at first sight appear to have missed consensus expectations at the operating level, we think this `messy' set of numbers is much less concerning when viewed in detail," Lehman Brothers said in a morning note. "After the restructuring of the balance sheet in 2007 and the uncertainty of the size of the expected annuity reserving change, consensus operating profit estimates were unusually unreliable, having a spread of 33 percent." L&G recommended a full-year dividend of 5.97p, up 7.6 percent on the year earlier. The insurer reiterated it has no material exposure to credit-impaired securities, and said its financial strength ratings were unchang
