 KUWAIT, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kuwait's ruler could dissolve parliament and call an election in the Gulf oil exporter after the government's sudden resignation brought a long-running political crisis to a head, analysts said on Tuesday. "I think the emir will dissolve the parliament to end this crisis between government and parliament," said political analyst Ali al-Baghli, a former Kuwaiti oil minister. "The government was not decisive enough and lacked a clear agenda and MPs focussed on popular demands ... There is hope that a new assembly will change things but I am not too optimistic." The cabinet quit en masse on Monday less than a year after it was sworn in, complaining of a lack of cooperation from a parliament that has grilled ministers over their conduct, leading to several resignations. The standoff has paralysed political life and delayed economic reforms. Kuwait has yet to name an oil minister to replace Badr al-Humaidhi, who resigned days after his appointment in November under pressure from hostile deputies. The previous cabinet had itself resigned to avert a parliamentary no-confidence vote in the then health minister, a member of the ruling family. Emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, who has the last say in politics, has repeatedly urged deputies and the government to work together for the sake of the country, but to little avail. Politicians and analysts say Sheikh Sabah has two options. He can either accept the resignation and name the current or a new prime minister to form a new cabinet, or he can dissolve parliament and call a new election within two months. Islamist lawmaker Dhaifallah Buraimi said the ruler would probably dissolve the assembly since intermittent cabinet reshuffles over the past year had failed to break the deadlock, a view that was also echoed in Kuwait papers on Tuesday. "The government was unable to rule the country," he said. Kuwaiti rulers have repeatedly dissolved assemblies since parliament was set up in the ex-British protectorate in 1963. POLITICAL DEADLOCK Parliament had made progress approving long-awaited reforms such as a reduction in taxes on foreign firms and privatisation of the loss-making national airline. But tensions flared again on Sunday when lawmakers demanded another pay rise for public sector employees who comprise more than 90 percent of working Kuwaitis. The demands put parliament on a collision course with the government which had already raised state salaries in February to counter high inflation. Musallam al-Barrak of the Popular Bloc said the last straw for the government was the salary raise, but like many deputies, he blamed a lack of cooperation on the part of the government. "It has been difficult dealing with the government," he told reporters in parliament. Kuwait wants to diversify the economy away from oil to emulate the success of Gulf neighbours Dubai or Bahrain which have become regional financial centres. But a key bill to set up a financial regulator and open up the stock market to more foreign investment has been stalled in parliament. Instead, deputies forced the cabinet to set up a fund to buy back bad debts Kuwaiti nationals incurred from shopping sprees, in a blow to plans end reliance on a nanny state. Speaker Jasim al-Kharafi delayed until April 1 a parliament session that was meant to take place on Tuesday, after the government said it could not attend until its fate was decid
