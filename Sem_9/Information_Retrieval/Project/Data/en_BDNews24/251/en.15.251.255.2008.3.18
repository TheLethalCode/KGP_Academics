<TITLE> EU door wide open, but will Croatia waltz in? </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ZAGREB, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union's door is wide open for Croatia to join, but the former Yugoslav republic first has to show it is ready to bring in deep reforms and analysts say this can not be taken for granted. "This is one of those rare positive moments in history that must be seized. All the other obstacles have been removed. The spotlight is on Croatia. And that's why I am concerned," said Chris Cviic, a London-based Balkans expert, on Tuesday. The EU's executive Commission told Prime Minister Ivo Sanader last week -- after he pushed through parliament an unpopular motion allowing EU states to fish freely in the Adriatic -- that Zagreb can finish accession talks by mid-2009. To achieve that, in the next 15 months Croatia will have to step up its fight against corruption, revamp its judiciary and public administration, overhaul loss-making shipyards, cut state subsidies and reform public health, pension and tax systems. "It's an immense job, an immense challenge, and I feel the administration may not be sufficiently motivated," said Cviic, a Croatia-born former editor and analyst of the Economist. "But Sanader has a good majority in parliament and can politically justify every painful reform. So it is now or never," he said. Zagreb's membership bid languished in the past year, amid slow reforms, a long election campaign that gave Sanader another 4-year mandate, and a fishing row with EU neighbours. Hrvoje Stojic of Hypo Alpe Adria Bank said the government had so far delayed the more painful reforms, like shipyard restructuring, which could cause job losses. "Now that we have a date, a carrot, there is much more incentive to get to work. We can do it if there is political will. Or we can wait another 3 or 4 years," Stojic said. BALKAN EYES ON CROATIA Andjelko Milardovic of the Centre for Political Research saw overhaul of the judiciary and the public administration as the biggest challenge. "It is a conservative and corrupt system, which is just crying out to be quickly modernised," he said. Croatia is almost certain to be invited next month to join the U.S. NATO military alliance. But lack of its quick progress with the EU could send a bad signal to the Balkans, where Kosovo's independence from Serbia is threatening to renew ethnic hostilities. "We would set a bad example for the region and boost those in the Balkans who say: 'See, the EU only demands and gives nothing in return'. That could destabilise the region, a black scenario that everyone fears," said political analyst Zeljko Trkanjec. EU entry for Croatia could make it a beacon for the rest of the turbulent region and the wide-selling Jutarnji List daily said its success would allow Brussels to offer more incentive to other Balkan states this year. Bosnia would sign an accord on closer ties, Montenegro and Albania would get a signal to apply for membership and Macedonia a date for opening accession talks. Serbia would face a choice of moving towards the EU or becoming the new Belarus, it said. The EU is therefore keen to see Zagreb's membership bid move fast, but probably not so much as to let it join unprepared. "If there is political will among EU majors to get Croatia in on the fast track, as a signal for the region, then this is possible," said Trkanjec. "But Europe may not be ready to risk another Romania and Bulgaria," Trkanjec said. The two Balkan countries had to postpone their entry date for a year because of slow reforms and joined in 2007, although many diplomats said they were not fully prepared. "It is more likely that the Commission would eventually lend us its own experts to get the job done properly," Trkanjec sa
