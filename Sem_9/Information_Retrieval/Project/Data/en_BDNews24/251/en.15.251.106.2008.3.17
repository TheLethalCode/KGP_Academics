 BANGKOK, March 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thai police pressed alleged international arms dealer Viktor Bout to board a plane for the United States, where he has been charged with aiding terrorism, after his arrest in Thailand, his lawyer said on Monday. "He was doing everything in his power, including physical resistance, not to fly to the US," lawyer Yan Dasgupta told reporters in Bangkok, where his client was caught in a US sting operation on March 6. Bout was not harmed and remains in a Bangkok prison, but the move was unlawful because it did not follow proper procedure under a Thai-US extradition treaty, Dasgupta said. "Even with his consent, it would have been illegal," he said. Thai police denied attempting to coerce Bout, dubbed the "Merchant of Death" of the clandestine arms trade and picked up from a Bangkok hotel hours after arriving from Moscow. "That is just lawyer's talk," Police Colonel Phetcharat Saengchai, who is leading the Thai investigation, told Reuters. "We have to follow the Thai legal process by first bringing this terrorism-related case to court," Phetcharat said. "We cannot simply put him on a plane." Bout was denied bail last week on a Thai charge of "seeking or gathering assets for terrorism". He is also charged in New York with conspiring to sell weapons worth millions of dollars to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. Bout's British associate, Andrew Smulian, was accused of similar charges on March 10 after he was arrested in New York. Bout told police he was in Bangkok on holiday and his lawyers say their client was not involved with terrorist groups such as al Qaeda or the Southeast Asian network linked to it, Jemaah Islamiah. "He considers his arrest unlawful and groundless," said Dasgupta, adding that Bout faced no charges in Russia, where he operates an aircraft repair company. According to the United Nations and the US Treasury Department, Bout runs a network of air cargo companies and has sold or brokered arms that have helped fuel wars in Afghanistan, Angola, Liberia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and Sudan. The United States, which has given billions of dollars in military aid to Colombia to fight the Marxist rebels and drug cartels, has said it will seek Bout's extradition. Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman Tharit Jaroongwat said no formal request had been received from Washington "because they still need to gather evidence and build a case against him". US officials were not immediately available to comment. Thai police, who can detain Bout for three months, say they expect to finish their investigation in two months before submitting it to prosecutors. Thai police have said Bout's extradition would have to wait until after he was tried in Thailand. Thai laws require detained foreign terror suspects to be tried in the country. Bout's jail conditions were generally good, but he was not allowed to write letters home in Russian or read newspapers, Dasgupta said, calling the restrictions a "gross violation of his right
