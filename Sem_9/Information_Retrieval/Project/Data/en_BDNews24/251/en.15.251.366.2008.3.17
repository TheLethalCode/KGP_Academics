<TITLE> Last chance saloon for Koeman and Valencia in Cup </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MADRID, March 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Valencia's last chance to take something positive from the season depends on them getting through their King's Cup semi-final, second leg at home to Barcelona with a goalless draw or a win on Thursday. Ronald Koeman's troubled outfit put on an impressive defensive display in the first leg last month, and were only denied a 1-0 victory by Xavi's injury-time equaliser at the Nou Camp. But these are difficult times for Valencia. They are on a run of six matches without a win in all competitions, and have the joint worst home record in the league. Their 2-1 defeat at the Mestalla to Sevilla on Saturday left them 11th in the Primera Liga, nine points off the European places, but more worryingly only four above the relegation zone. The Cup winners earn a place in next seasons's UEFA Cup. Koeman's controversial decision to drop the likes of David Albelda and Miguel Angel Angulo, his tactics, and three wins from 17 league games since he replaced Quique Sanchez Flores, have won him few friends. "We need a change and it could happen on Thursday. I don't like to think about what might happen if we don't win," Koeman said after the Sevilla defeat. Koeman's opposite number, Dutch compatriot Frank Rijkaard, is also under pressure though his side are still going strong on three fronts. They are in the Champions League quarter-finals, and second in the league behind Real Madrid but only impress intermittently and look fragile in defence. They have one win from their last five games in all competitions and were missing the injured Lionel Messi, Ronaldinho, Deco and Yaya Toure in their 2-2 draw away to promoted Almeria in the league on Sunday. OUTSTANDING TEAM The other semi-final, to be played on Wednesday, appears closer to a resolution with the Primera Liga's outstanding team of the moment, Getafe, holding a 3-1 first leg lead over fellow high-flyers Racing Santander. Michael Laudrup's Getafe are on an 11-match unbeaten run in all competitions, are eighth in the standings, have a UEFA Cup quarter-final against Bayern Munich to look forward to, and are on the brink of a second successive King's Cup final appearance. On top of that, they scored a psychological blow over Racing on Sunday beating them 2-1 at the Coliseum in the Primera Liga. Marcelino's Racing, in their first appearance in the final four, are a different side at the Sardinero though, where they have won all their Cup ties in the current campaign
