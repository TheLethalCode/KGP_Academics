 LONDON, Mar 17 (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - Oil rose to a record near $112 on Monday as a surprise weekend cut in the Federal Reserve discount rate and the sale of stricken U.S. investment bank Bear Stearns sent the dollar to all-time lows. U.S. crude for April hit a fresh high of $111.80 a barrel. It was trading $1.15 up at $111.36 a barrel by 0915 GMT. May London Brent crude was $1.28 higher at $107.48. "The recent oil prices have been swayed by the currency moves, including this latest rally to a record," said Tony Nunan, risk management executive at Tokyo-based Mitsubishi. "The dollar weakness is the factor at the moment." The dollar plunged across the board on Monday as the spiraling U.S. financial crisis led to JPMorgan Chase acquiring Bear Stearns, stirring fears that more financial firms may become casualties. The Federal Reserve took more emergency measures to stem the fast-spreading financial crisis, cutting its discount rate on Sunday and opening up discount window lending to major investment banks, a tool not used since the Great Depression. The dollar slid 3 percent against the yen at one point to its lowest since 1995. The euro hit a peak against the dollar as investors became more convinced that the Fed and other major central banks may have to conduct coordinated dollar-buying intervention to stem the sell-off. Fed policy-makers are set to meet on Tuesday and are widely expected to lower the benchmark federal funds rate by up to a full-point. Crude oil prices have risen by about 16 percent so far this year. Key commodities include oil have hit record highs as investors have shifted money to hedge a weakening U.S. dollar. Ministers of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries maintain their view that high oil prices are not related to fundamentals, but are due to speculation and the U.S. dollar's fall. "There is no problem at all with world oil inventories," Kuwait's Oil Minister Mohammad al-Olaim said in comments published by state news agency KUNA on Monday, echoing similar remarks on Sunday by OPEC President Chakib Khelil. Adding support to energy markets, Iraq halted pumping of Kirkuk crude through its northern pipeline to Turkey on Sunday due to a minor breakdown, although this was expected to resume soon, a shipping source said on Monday. In Nigeria, an oil workers' union is calling for a strike in the oil sector starting on Wednesday to protest about a labor dispute at the Nigerian arm of ExxonMobil, a union boss said on Monday.
