 MORONI, March 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Soldiers from Comoros have clashed with rebels on the island of Anjouan ahead of a planned assault by government troops with African Union support, officials in the Indian Ocean islands said on Monday.

Comoros officials say there is no other option left for Anjouan than a military assault after mediation failed to end a protracted standoff with Bacar, who declared himself the winner of an illegal vote last June.
