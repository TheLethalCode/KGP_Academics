<TITLE> Bear Stearns crisis batters stocks, dollar </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, March 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Global stocks sank and the dollar tumbled on Monday as a fire sale of Bear Stearns and a Federal Reserve emergency cut of a key lending rate sparked fears that worldwide credit crisis will claim more casualties. European shares opened nearly 3 percent lower following a sell-off in Japan where the leading index shed more than 3.5 percent. The dollar hit new lows against the euro and a basket six of major currencies. Oil hit a new high of nearly $112 a barrel on the weaker dollar. Investors dived into safe haven assets, lifting gold to more than $1,030 an ounce at one point and sending yields on short-dated euro zone debt below 3 percent for the first time in more than two years. "The markets are in a complete state of panic and in such situations there is no such thing as valuation or value in any asset," said Michael Klawitter, FX strategis at Dresdner Kleinwort in Frankfurt. In an unexpected move late on Sunday, the Fed lowered the discount rate it charges on direct loans to banks to 3.25 percent from 3.50 percent and implemented steps to provide cash to a wider range of financial firms, using tools last used in the Great Depression. Minutes earlier, JPMorgan Chase & Co had said it would buy Bear Stearns for a rock-bottom price of $2 a share, valuing the U.S. investment bank at the centre of a widening global credit crisis at about $236 million. JPMorgan and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York temporarily bailed out Bear Stearns on Friday after a deterioration in the latter's liquidity, one the worst cases yet in a broad-based drying up that has been going on since mid-2007. Investors are now nearly fully pricing in a 1 percentage point cut in the main federal funds rate at or before the Fed's policy meeting on Tuesday. "Desperate times need desperate measures. The Federal Reserve is doing what it takes to restore stability," said Craig James, chief equities economist at Commesec in Sydney. STOCKS, DOLLAR DOWN SHARPLY Equity markets took a hefty hit across the world as uncertainty grabbed hold of investors. European shares tumbled in early trade. The FTSEurofirst 300 was down 2.9 percent. Earlier, Japanese stocks fell to about a 2-1/2 year closing low, dragged down by exporters worried about a rising yen. The benchmark Nikkei average fell 3.7 percent or 454.09 points to end at 11,787.51, its lowest finish since Aug. 8, 2005. The broader TOPIX index shed 3.7 percent or 43.58 points to 1,149.65, the lowest close since June 2005. The dollar plunged across the board. It slid as much as 3 percent in early Monday trading to as low as 95.77 yen according to Reuters data, the lowest since 1995, and set fresh all-time lows at 0.9637 Swiss francs. It later recovered slightly to 97.21 yen and 0.9825 Swiss franc. The euro soared as high as a new record $1.5904 before dropping back to $1.5788. The weak dollar drove oil prices higher. Crude for April delivery was up $1.10 at $111.31 a barrel, off a record $111.80 hit earlier. SEEKING SAFETY Investors dived into safer assets. Spot gold hit $1,030 an ounce, before falling back to around $1,023 an ounce. "Gold will be the main beneficiary (of the falling dollar) as a hedge against global risk," said Australia & New Zealand Bank senior commodities analyst Mark Pervan. When the US currency falls, the price of gold, like that of oil, tends to rise as investors with dollars buy it to lock in value and non-dollar investors find it cheaper. Investors also bought bonds. Short-dated euro zone government bond yields were at their lowest in over two years and implied rates down. The two-year cash yield fell 8 basis points to 2.984 percent , its lowest since early 2006 while the 10-year Bund yield was down 3 basis points at 3.6
