 Islamabad, March 18 (BBC/bdnews24.com) -- The Pakistan People's Party (PPP) of slain opposition leader Benazir Bhutto Monday named a close associate of her husband as parliamentary speaker. Fahmida Mirza, a businesswoman, will be Pakistan's first female speaker of the national assembly if she is approved in a vote Wednesday. But correspondents say divisions remain over who should be the next PM. Mirza, 51, is an experienced politician from Bhutto's home town in the province of Sindh. Her husband, Zulfiqar Mirza, is a long standing ally of Asif Ali Zardari, Bhutto's widower and now the PPP's leader. Zulfiqar Mirza sits in the Sindh provincial assembly. The new parliament - comprising opponents of President Musharraf who swept to victory in last month's elections - met for the first time on Monday.
