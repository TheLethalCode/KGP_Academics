<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 17 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh's national cricket team captain Mohammad Ashraful Monday apologised profusely for Sunday's incident involving a spectator. "Yesterday an incident occurred before the practice session that was totally unintentional. I apologise for the incident and ask you to regard it in a merciful way," Ashraful told reporters just before the pre-match briefing at Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium (SBNS) Monday. Ashraful Sunday was reported to have slapped a spectator for swearing at him on the way to the Indoor Complex for practice during the Premier Cricket Twenty20 final match between Abahani and City Club at the SBNS. Some 100 spectators, who were watching the final match, called the national team captain 'bhua' (rubbish) and the Bangladesh captain reportedly losing his cool slapped a youth at the gate that connects the SBNS with the Indoor Complex. Ashraful hopes such an incident will never be repeated in future. "We all want to see the progress of cricket," Ashraful said, "I hope this progress will continue through the supports and the players." Bangladesh coach Jamie Siddons believes the chapter should be closed after Ashraful's admission of regret and apology, though the coach was disappointed at some of the reactions from his players. "The crowd also has a right to be disappointed; I wish they wouldn't, but they have the right, they pay the money to get in," said the Australian. " I think they need to understand the quality of the opposition that we play and our team is also very young." "But players have no right to react the way they have. Ashraful has apologised today. Hopefully that's the end of it," the coach said. Siddons added: "I am sure as soon as we start to play good cricket, the crowd will be back on our side." Bangladesh will take on Ireland in the three-ODI series opener Tuesday at the same venue. b
