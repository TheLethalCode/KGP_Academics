 WELLINGTON, March 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England were "desperate" to win the second test against New Zealand to end an eight-match streak without a victory, captain Michael Vaughan said on Monday. England bowled New Zealand out for 311 early on the final day of the second test at the Basin Reserve to record an 126-run win -- their first since they beat West Indies by seven wickets in Durham last June. It was also England's first win overseas since they beat India by 212 runs in Mumbai in March 2006. Vaughan had not won a test overseas since beating South Africa by 77 runs in Johannesburg in January 2005. "We were all desperate to win a game of cricket," Vaughan told reporters. "I can only say how delighted I am for that set of players and the management, we've not won many games and we've all been working very, very hard. "It's just nice to be sat in the dressing room with a victory under our belts. "We won't go over the top, we'll treat the game with respect, we know New Zealand are hard to beat on their home soil. "A week in cricket is a long time." Vaughan had said before the match his side needed to improve from their performance in Hamilton, where they lost by 189 runs, and while he was pleased with the outcome there was still work to be done. "There's an improvement from Hamilton but there's still a long way to go before we can say we're a proper team again," said Vaughan. "As a bowling unit I thought we were excellent throughout the match, catching unit not so good and as a batting unit we got a little bit better but we've still a long way to go in that." The final test begins in Napier on March
