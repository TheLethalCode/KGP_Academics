<TITLE> Light decision was umpires call says Taylor </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WELLINGTON, March 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The decision to allow England to bowl one over with the second new ball in failing light was the umpires' and New Zealand would have to live with it, batsman Ross Taylor said on Sunday. Jacob Oram survived four deliveries of Ryan Sidebottom's over with the new ball but was then caught on the fifth to reduce New Zealand to 242 for six, chasing an unlikely victory target of 438, late on the fourth day of the second test. New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori then faced the final ball of the 81st over before the umpires abandoned the day's play four overs early. The players had left the field due to the poor light 30 minutes previously before they returned five minutes later. Oram had been involved in a 69-run partnership with wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum and the pair looked to have settled on seeing out the day's play in an effort to launch an attempt on an improbable victory on the final day on Monday. "It was disappointing to lose that wicket," Taylor told reporters. "It would have been nice to go into tomorrow only being five down, but that's the umpires' call. "He (Oram) was disappointed to get out but again it's the umpires' call. I'm sure he will reflect on that a bit later on." BIG HUNDRED Taylor admitted the responsibility of scoring the bulk of the 196 runs needed to win the test and series, would now fall on the shoulders of McCullum (43 not out) and Vettori (0). "We have put the pressure on Daniel and Brendon to get us a big hundred to win us the game," Taylor said. "Tomorrow morning will be crucial with the new ball. If we can see the new ball through for the first hour without losing a wicket then our chances of winning improve immensely." England's Stuart Broad, however, said the match was definitely there to win for his side to level the series. "We're pleased with the position we're in needing four wickets to win a test match on the last day," he said. "With this new ball it's very important we strike early." Broad, who took two wickets in one over after lunch to remove Matthew Bell and Stephen Fleming, added the team had responded well since they were lost the first test in Hamilton by 189 runs. "(We are) delighted with the position. The wicket has suited us so far, playing into our hands here. "We've come out fighting, bowled nicely, batted nicely, and fielded well up until today. We're really pleased.
