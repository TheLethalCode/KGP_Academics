<TITLE> Malaysia PM shakes up cabinet after poll setback </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Putrajaya, Malaysia, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Malaysia's prime minister made sweeping changes to his cabinet line-up on Tuesday, dumping his long-serving trade minister, after the ruling coalition suffered a heavy setback at elections this month. The omission of Trade Minister Rafidah Aziz, a minister for almost 30 years and a senior member of the main ruling party, was the biggest surprise in the new line-up, which could shape Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi's political future. "Half (of the cabinet) will be new faces and will represent the people effectively," said Abdullah, who faces a possible test of his leadership at party elections later this year. Asked why Rafidah, reputedly the world's longest-serving trade minister with 20 years in the job, had been dropped, he replied: "I don't want to discuss this. I don't need to explain further. "Rafidah needs to make way for someone new to take over." Rafidah was replaced by ex-farm minister Muhyiddin Yassin. Abdullah's National Front coalition suffered the biggest electoral setback in its 50-year reign on March 8, when it lost its two-thirds majority in federal parliament and five of the country's 13 states to opposition parties. He kept technocrat Nor Mohamed Yakcop as second finance minister, a role in which he effectively runs economic and fiscal policy, though Abdullah formally remains the finance minister. The new line-up comprises some younger politicians than the previous cabinet, which was known as the "mummified cabinet" by opposition parties because it included several ministers with more than 20 years of service.
