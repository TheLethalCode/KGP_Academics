 JERUSALEM, March 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Dozens of right-wing Jewish activists on Sunday stormed the Arab neighbourhood in East Jerusalem of a Palestinian gunman who killed eight Israelis at a Jewish seminary earlier this month, police and witnesses said. Dozens of protesters broke through police barriers and hurled stones at cars and houses in the neighborhood of Jabal Mukaber, where the family of the seminary attacker lives. About 200 people had gathered outside the village and a number of the protesters broke through the police barrier, said police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld. "Stones were thrown and 13 people were arrested," Rosenfeld said. No one was injured in the violence, police said. The attacker, Ala Abu Dhaim, was buried at night on Thursday after about a week's delay because police feared a public funeral might trigger protests and violence. The attack on the Jewish seminary earlier this month was the deadliest Palestinian attack on Israelis in two years and the first major attack in Jerusalem in four year
