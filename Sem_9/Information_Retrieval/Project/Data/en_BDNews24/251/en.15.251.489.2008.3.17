 Hong Kong, March 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks sank on Monday to their lowest level since August 2007 and the dollar tumbled, as the fire sale of ailing U.S. bank Bear Stearns and the Federal Reserve's emergency cut in its discount rate intensified concerns that there could be more victims of the global credit crisis. U.S. stock futures fell in Asian trade, pointing to a sharply lower Wall Street open later in the day, as global investors wonder if other financial institutions might need rescuing. S&P 500 futures fell 30 points, while Dow Jones industrial average futures dropped more than 200 points. The fall in the dollar, which sank to a record low against the euro, sent spot gold and crude futures hurling towards record highs, deepening concerns of rising inflationary pressures throughout the region. Other safe-haven assets also rose. Japanese government bond futures hit a three-year high and U.S. Treasury futures rose to a five-year high. "Desperate times need desperate measures. The Federal Reserve is doing what it takes to restore stability and if it means cutting the discount rate on a Sunday night in the U.S., then so be it," said Craig James, chief equities economist at Commesec in Sydney. The MSCI measure of Asian stocks outside Japan dropped 3.8 percent as of 0316 GMT, after earlier hitting its lowest since Aug. 20, 2007. The index is now down about 20 percent for the year, marking a sharp reversal from five previous years of double-digit gains. Financial firms across the region were hammered, including Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and South Korea's biggest lender Kookmin Bank . In an unexpected move before the markets opened in Asia, the Federal Reserve lowered the discount rate it charges on direct loans to banks and set up a a new programme to provide cash to a wider range of financial firms, using tools it has not used since the Great Depression. At the same time, JPMorgan Chase & Co said it would buy Bear Stearns for a rock-bottom price of $2 a share, valuing the U.S. investment bank at the centre of a widening global credit crisis at about $236 million. The uncertainty has caused futures on the federal funds rate to soar, with March futures contract showing a roughly 25 percent chase of 125 basis points of cuts at the Fed's policy meeting on Tuesday. PAINFUL 2008 Japan's Nikkei average dropped 3.2 percent hitting earlier its lowest since August 2005, with exporters, such as Toyota Motor Corp , sinking after the dollar hit a 13-year low against the yen. Elsewhere in Asia, shares in Hong Kong fell 4.9 percent, South Korean stocks dropped over 3 percent, while markets in Shanghai , Taiwan , and Singapore were down more than 2 percent each. Asian stocks are suffering from a painful 2008 as subprime and credit-related writedowns in the global financial sector are happening at a time when analysts fear the U.S. economy is in or about to enter a recession. The twin effects are having a knock-on effect from Bangkok to Tokyo. Local currencies are strengthening in line with the slumping dollar, denting the growth outlook for the export-dependent region by hitting returns from overseas and making goods less competitive. Meanwhile, surging food and energy prices are hitting the pocketbooks of Asian consumers, leaving central banks in a bind as they must deal with slowing economic growth but rising inflation. DOLLAR SINKS, GOLD SOARS The dollar plunged 3 percent gainst the yen to hit a 13-year low below 96 yen and was on course to post its biggest one-day drop since 1998. The U.S. currency was last trading at 95.77 yen, from near 99.00 in late New York trade on Friday. The euro vaulted to a record $1.5905 against the dollar, up 1.5 percent on the day. "Market players are afraid that there will be a second and third Bear Stearns out there," said Kosuke Hanao, head of forex sales at HSBC in Tokyo. The slumping dollar and the perceived safety quality sent spot gold up more than 3 percent to a record $1,030.80. Bullion later gave up some of the gains to trade at $1,022.60/$1023.40, compared with late New York levels on Friday of $996.90/997.70. Prices of bullion were last trading at $1,020.09/1,021.70. Oil jumped to its latest record on Monday as well, with crude for April delivery up at 88 cents at $111.09 a barrel, continuing a string of peaks hit since through late last week. Investors opted for other asset classes perceived to be safer, with Japanese June bond futures jumping 0.98 point to 141.25, the highest since July 2005.
