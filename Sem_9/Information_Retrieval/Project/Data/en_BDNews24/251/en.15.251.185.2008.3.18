 United Nations, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said on Monday he was "increasingly concerned" about reports of violence and loss of life in Tibet. "At this time I urge restraint on the part of the authorities and call on all concerned to avoid further confrontation and violence," Ban told reporters at U.N. headquarters in New York. Ethnic Tibetan students staged a candle-lit vigil in Beijing on Monday, saying it was to pray for the dead, hours before a midnight deadline warning anti-Chinese rioters in the Tibetan capital to surrender. China, which has sent in troops to enforce control in the regional capital Lhasa, said earlier that the violent protests by Tibetans were organized by followers of the Dalai Lama seeking to derail the Beijing Olympics in August. Tibet's exiled spiritual leader has denied this charge. Asked whether the United Nations should play a role in the crisis in the light of calls for an independent U.N. investigation, Ban said he was following the situation closely, adding "We'll get back to you." He said he had no information on exact numbers of casualties in the clashes. "I had meetings with the Chinese ambassador this morning and also we discussed this matter and I expressed my concern and my views to the Chinese government," he said. "I'm increasingly concerned about the tension and reports of violence and loss of life in Tibet and elsewhere," he said, adding that he stressed the importance of a peaceful solution.
