 Biplob Rahman bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, March 18 (bdnews24.com) -- The Election Commission has abandoned plans to manufacture transparent ballot boxes in the country and is attempting to source them free of cost from the Canadian government, an election commissioner said Tuesday. Election Commissioner Sohul Hossain told bdnews24.com that manufacturing the ballot boxes locally had proved to be prohibitively expensive. "The cost of the materials needed from abroad is very high. We also have time constraints as the national elections need to be held by December," said Sohul. "Therefore a decision had been made not to manufacture the boxes locally through a joint investment venture as was originally planned." Sohul said the Election Commission was in talks with the Canadian government about the possibility of sourcing transparent ballot boxes free of cost from them. The EC will use the steel ballot boxes it already has in the upcoming national polls if the transparent ballot boxes cannot be supplied, said the commissioner. The development follows assurances by the chief election commissioner, in a recent interview with bdnews24.com on Feb 6, that the cost of making the ballot boxes locally would be "minimal". In the interview, the CEC said there was no need to import transparent ballot boxes from abroad and an international tender would be floated regarding the boxes. EC officials had earlier said that in addition to companies from Canada and Denmark, local concerns including Machine Tools Factory and Bengal Plastics Industries had expressed interest in manufacturing clear plastic ballot boxes. Machine Tools Factory offered to procure or lease equipment from abroad if necessary to manufacture the boxes in order to fulfil the contract. The Canadian embassy notified the Election Commission in 2006 that Canada would need about two years to manufacture enough transparent ballot boxes to serve 9.5 crore voters, at a cost of around Tk 35 crore. Three years ago, during the last BNP-led coalition government, the EC rejected a European Union offer of free transparent ballot boxes. One of the main advantages of transparent ballot boxes is they prevent stuffing of fake ballots, which reduces vote rigging. They are also lighter and more easily portable. The Awami League among other parties allies demanded the use of transparent ballot boxes in the upcoming elections during electoral reform dialogues with the EC. bdnews24.
