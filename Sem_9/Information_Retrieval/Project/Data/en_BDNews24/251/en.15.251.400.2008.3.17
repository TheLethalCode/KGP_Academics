 Dhaka, March 17 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) Monday postponed the ongoing inter-club footballer transfers until the completion of the BFF election by April. The decision was made after a meeting among the club officials and the BFF high-ups at the BFF House. "We have decided to postpone the transfer after request of the clubs, that told us they have been suffering from financial problems," said BFF acting general secretary Manzoor Hossain Malu. "Besides, two upcoming national assignments - AFC Challenge Cup and SAFF Championship -- and Abahani's participation in the AFC President Club this month have also prompted us to suspend the transfer process," said Malu. The inter-club booter transfers started on March 15 and would April 14, but the country's football governing body was forced to stop the process to demands of clubs of the professional football league. On March 12, the representatives from eight clubs, including Mohammedan, Abahani, Muktijoddha, Brothers, declined to take part in the players bourse and submitted a written paper to the BFF president to stop the process. They wanted to know how it would be possible to play the Independence Cup and participate in the players' bourse simultaneously. They also said it was not possible to take part in the player transfers before the BFF poll, scheduled for April 28. On March 16, the footballers also met with the BFF high-ups to request them to make the clubs understand to take part in the transfer as the footballers are going through crisis since the last transfer in early 2007. The footballers will sit Tuesday on the next plan action.
