<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 17 (bdnews24.com)- Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said Monday the government would not hold any pre-budget discussion with political parties. "I have no plan to hold separate talks with the political parties on the upcoming budget, as the government already has a plan to hold political dialogues with the parties," he said. He added, however, that after taking power the next elected government could make changes to the budget. The finance adviser spoke to reporters after a pre-budget meeting with the former finance minister, former finance advisers, former finance secretaries, economists and researchers at the finance ministry Monday. Mirza Aziz said: "In the meeting, all advised the government to take necessary steps to keep the price of essentials within the reach of common people." "They have also advised expanding the social security net in the next budget (2008-09) considering the present situation of the poor." On input for preparing the next budget, the adviser said: "The next budget will be prepared with the involvement of almost all relevant quarters except the political parties." "After the election, if the next government wants to it can amend the budget as it wishes." Mentioning that the present administration has taken an initiative to formulate a law on fiscal responsibility and accountability of government, he said: "The draft has already been approved in principle in the meeting of the council of advisers. It has been sent to the law ministry for scrutiny." In the draft law a provision has been kept for adjusting the budget in March, well ahead of the new budget. At present, parliament only has a chance to adjust the previous year's budget when passing the forthcoming budget. Under the new law, the finance minister would be required to make at least three speeches in parliament on the forthcoming budget, giving lawmakers an opportunity to more fully discuss different aspects of the budget. Asked whether the the budget of the current fiscal (2007-08) would be amended in March, the adviser said: "If the new law is finalised within a few days the budget could be amended in March." Bangladesh Bank governor Dr Salehuddin Ahmed, former adviser Hafizuddin Khan, former finance minister M Saifur Rahman, National Board of Revenue chairman Mohammad Abdul Majid, planning secretary Zafar Ahmed Chowdhury, ERD secretary Aminul Islam Bhuiyan, former finance secretaries Motiul Islam and Siddiqur Rahman Chowdhury, economist and chairman of Centre for Policy Dialogue Rehman Sobhan, former ERD secretary Moshiur Rahman, and Dhaka University economics professor MA Taslim participated in the discussion. bdnews24.
