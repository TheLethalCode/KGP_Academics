 WELLINGTON, March 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Teenage pace bowler Tim Southee was added to an otherwise unchanged New Zealand squad for the third test against England, beginning in Napier on Saturday. Southee, who played in the Twenty20 matches against England at the start of the tour, was recently named player of the tournament at the International Cricket Council's under-19 World Cup in Malaysia. The 19-year-old took 17 wickets at an average of 6.64 at the tournament. Pace bowler Kyle Mills is to have a medical examination later on Monday after he experienced soreness behind his left knee during the second test, won by England on Monday by 126 runs. Southee was not regarded as cover for Mills and would be considered for selection if the Auckland pace bowler is declared fit for the third test, New Zealand Cricket said in a statement. The three-test series is tied at 1-1 after England's victory at the Basin Reserve. New Zealand won the first match in Hamilton by 189 runs. Squad Daniel Vettori (captain), Matthew Bell, Jamie How, Stephen Fleming, Ross Taylor, Mathew Sinclair, Jacob Oram, Grant Elliott, Brendon McCullum, Kyle Mills, Mark Gillespie, Jeetan Patel, Tim Southee, Chris Marti
