 LONDON, March 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British building materials group Wolseley reported a 23 percent fall in first-half profit on Monday, hit by the collapsing US housing market, and warned of tougher conditions, sending its shares to 5-year lows. Woleseley, the world's biggest distributor of plumbing and heating products, earns half its group revenues in North America. "Since our last update in January, markets have continued to weaken," Chief Executive Chip Hornsby told reporters. "US housing in particular is still declining against the backdrop of the global credit squeeze, which is affecting consumer confidence in many more markets including Europe." Wolseley reported trading profit of 300 million pounds ($591 million) for the six months to end-January, compared with analysts' average forecast of 307.6 million pounds, as its US unit Stock swung to a loss of 44 million. Wolseley defines trading profit as operating profit before amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles. It warned the US housing market was likely to deteriorate further and put additional pressure on the "repair, maintenance and improvement" (RMI) market. Its North American division includes plumbing and heating operation Ferguson and building materials unit Stock, which bore the brunt of the continued decline in new residential housing. Wolseley said housing starts fell 25 percent during its first half to an average of 1.2 million, with the trend worsening further to 1.0 million in January, increasing pressure both on volume and prices. In Europe, growth rates are also likely to slow, although the RMI and commercial industrial segments are expected to remain marginally positive, Wolseley said. Shares in Wolseley fell 5.6 percent to a 5-year low of 502 pence a share by 0850 GMT. The shares have fallen more than 40 percent over the past six months, hit by the U.S. slowdown and a weakening outlook for the non-residential market in the U.S. and Europe. Deutsche Bank analysts said 2009 consensus forecasts were likely to be cut sharply, and reduced their 2009 earnings per share forecast by 3.6 percent to 42.5 pence. NO BREACH IN COVENANT Wolseley, however, reassured investors that its cash flow remained strong with no breach in debt covenants and said it would cut costs further. "The group is fully in compliance with its borrowing covenants and is confident that this will remain the case," Wolseley said, adding it had committed and undrawn banking facilities of around 1 billion pounds at end-January. Wolseley, which slashed 10,000 jobs in the past 18 months, or more than 10 percent of its workforce, said it expected significant cost reductions in the second half, as it plans reduced capital spending and is more selective about acquisitions. The group raised its interim dividend by 3.7 percent to 11.25 pence per share, saying that showed confidence in its longer-term grow
