 Dhaka, March 17 (bdnews24.com)Vote-taking in the biennial election to the governing body of the FBCCI, the apex body of businessmen and industrialists, ended Monday. The FBCCI election began at 9am and continued through to 4:30pm for the voters to elect 12 directors each from chamber and association groups. The race saw 22 contestants in the association group and 27 in the chamber group. The voters this year number 1,536, an FBCCI election official said. FBCCI election board chairman Ali Ashraf told reporters: "In the association group, 1,135 voters out of 1,235 voters cast their votes. In the chamber group 306 from among 316 voters cast their votes." Another 14 directorsseven members from as many chambers and another seven from seven associations have already been nominated. All 38 directors will elect the president and the vice president Wednesday. Former BGMEA president Annisul Huq and former FBCCI director MA Rouf Chowdhury are contenders for president. Ashraf told bdnews24.com that the elections were held peacefully. "Our election can be a model for the national election." FBCCI used transparent ballot boxes for the election. "The ballot boxes have been brought in from abroad as a test case, but such boxes can also be made locally," he said. FBCCI administrator Syed Manzur Elahi told reporters: "The government set us a deadline to hold an election by April 5. I am glad we held the election by the deadline." After visiting the polling centres, Democracywatch executive director Taleya Rehman told bdnews24.com: "There was huge chaos in vote-taking." "This has to be made more disciplined. If necessary the election venue has to be moved elsewhere outside the Federation Bhaban. In that case changes may be necessary in the FBCCI constitution." Annisul Huq alleged that his rival president candidate MA Rouf Chowdhury had printed names of three candidates of his panel in the Rouf panel. Rouf denied the allegation. "The three candidates came to our panel voluntarily," he said. bdnews24.co
