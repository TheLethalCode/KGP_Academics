<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 17 (bdnews24.com)Food adviser AMM Shawkat Ali said Sunday Indian high commissioner Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty's comment on rice import from India had gone beyond diplomatic norms. The adviser Sunday wrote a letter to the foreign affairs ministry to take "necessary steps" about the statement of Chakravarty that Bangladesh was responsible for the delay in rice shipments from India. The adviser came down hard on the Indian envoy while speaking to bdnews24.com about the shipment of five lakh tonnes of rice from the neighbouring country. "What Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty said was not right at all. At the same time he went beyond diplomatic norms by saying that. I have written to the foreign ministry today to take necessary steps about the matter," Shawkat told bdnews24.com. Foreign secretary Md Touhid Hossain told bdnews24.com that he had not received the letter yet and declined to comment on the issue. On Saturday Chakravarty told a meeting with business leaders in Kushtia that it was Bangladesh that was "responsible for the delay in rice shipments from India". Shawkat said preparation for the rice shipments had been taken according to advice of the Indian authorities. The twin deals for one lakh tonne rice out of the five lakh tonnes have been signed. The adviser said an Indian team had arrived in Dhaka to discuss the signing of the remaining four lakh tonnes. bdnews24.com.co
