<TEXT>
 Warsaw, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Tuesday he would seek a referendum on the European Union reform treaty if the conservative opposition continued to block its ratification in parliament. "If in their belligerence (the conservatives) block the Lisbon treaty, we will have to appeal to the people in a referendum," Tusk told a news conference. "I hope this can be avoided." The treaty, agreed last year, aims to make the bloc more efficient. It must be approved by all 27 member nations. So far it has been ratified by five EU countries.
