 Islamabad, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Pakistani al Qaeda-linked militant, sentenced to death this month over a 2006 suicide attack that killed a U.S. diplomat, appealed on Tuesday against his sentence, his lawyer said. An anti-terrorism court convicted Anwar-ul-Haq for involvement in a bomb attack near the U.S. consulate in Karachi in March 2006 that killed U.S. diplomat David Foy and three other people on the eve of a visit to Pakistan by U.S. President George W. Bush. The bomber was also killed. "We have filed an appeal in the Sindh High Court against the death sentence," said lawyer Mohammad Farooq. Karachi is the capital of Sindh province. The appeal was filed on the grounds that there were "material contradictions" in witnesses' statements that led to the conviction, he said. "The most important thing is that the two witnesses which they produced, our contention is that they were planted witnesses," he said. At the time of his arrest, police said Haq was a trained militant with links to al Qaeda and had fought against U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Police said the blast, which wounded 49 people, was aimed at disrupting Bush's visit to Pakistan. The U.S. president went ahead with his trip to the capital, Islamabad, as scheduled. Bomb attacks on foreigners have been rare in Pakistan in recent years, but on Saturday a Turkish woman was killed and five Americans were among 11 people wounded in a blast at an Islamabad restaurant popular with foreigners. An Interior Ministry spokesman told a briefing on Tuesday "reasonable progress" was being made in the investigation into the attack. He declined to elaborate but said "in all probability" the bomb had been thrown over a wall into the restaurant's back garden dining area.
