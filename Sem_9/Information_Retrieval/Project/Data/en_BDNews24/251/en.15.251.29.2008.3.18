 Santiago, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chilean police arrested nearly a thousand people in the dawn hours on Tuesday in a nationwide raid in which they also seized arms, ammunition, drugs and stolen vehicles. Police said 844 people were arrested, many of them in the nation's capital Santiago, in the sweep that came amid reports of rising crime in one of Latin America's most vibrant economies. A spokesman for the Interior Ministry said more than 1,000 police participated in the sweep that came just days after the government announced new measures to clamp down on crime. Chile's economy is booming on the back of soaring copper prices, but the Andean country is also experiencing social tensions as some complain the newfound wealth is not fairly distributed.
