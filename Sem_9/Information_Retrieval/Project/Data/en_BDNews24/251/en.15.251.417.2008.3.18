<TITLE> Japan in new deadlock over central bank governor </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's government proposed its second nominee for central bank governor on Tuesday, only to see him swiftly rejected by the main opposition party, leaving parliament once again deadlocked just a day before the current governor retires. The rebuff means Japan will likely appoint a temporary Bank of Japan head to replace Toshihiko Fukui when his term ends at midnight on Wednesday (1500 GMT), a stopgap measure that analysts had said should be avoided in the midst of a global credit crisis. Political analysts said they were stunned that Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda, having seen one former top finance ministry official vetoed in parliament's opposition-controlled upper house, had nominated someone with the same credentials. The government had put forward Koji Tanami, the 68-year-old head of a state-funded lending agency, as its second pick for governor. He was once vice minister of finance, the top bureaucratic position in the ministry and the same job as that once held by Toshiro Muto, whom opposition parties rejected last week. While Muto, currently deputy BOJ governor, was rejected for his close ties to the government, the main opposition Democratic Party cast doubt on the experience of Tanami to head the BOJ. "We have doubts about whether he can do the job as he is not an expert on international financial problems," the Democrats' secretary-general, Yukio Hatoyama, told reporters. "We have to be very careful about the selection because the BOJ governor has a responsibility to protect people's livelihoods." STOPGAP GOVERNOR With Tanami set to be rejected, it will bring the government back to square one in its search for a new Bank of Japan leader, with a deputy governor slated to take over once Fukui's term ends. Parliament has already approved one new deputy governor, former central banker Masaaki Shirakawa, and the Democrats said they would back a second nominee for deputy governor, current BOJ board member Kiyohiko Nishimura, when parliament votes on Wednesday. One small opposition party broke ranks and said it would vote with the government on the central bank nominations, but its four lawmakers would not be enough to swing the balance in the upper house of parliament, which must approve BOJ nominations. Fukuda, already under fire from voters over a broad paralysis in policy-making, had said he believed the Democrats would make a "sensible decision". "Tanami is knowledgeable about both international finance and the domestic economy. He's perfect in terms of both character and insight," Fukuda told reporters ahead of the opposition decision. "Monetary policy needs independence from the government but it also needs coordination with the government." Underlying the succession row is a traditional rotation of the job of heading the BOJ between career central bankers and former finance ministry officials. As Fukui is a career central banker, the government may see it as the turn of a former ministry bureaucrat -- despite the misgivings of opposition lawmakers that such a governor would threaten the BOJ's independence from the government. "It's a different name but more or less the same kind of candidate. How come (Fukuda) is so determined to install a former vice finance minister? I'm disappointed," said Jun Azumi, the Democratic Party's deputy head of parliamentary affairs. MARKET WANTS A DECISION Deadlock over Fukui's successor will not have a big impact on monetary policy since Japan's interest rates are near rock bottom, analysts say, but they said the crisis in financial markets means a permanent governor is needed. "What's most important for the market is that they decide on a new governor by tomorrow," said Yumi Nishimura, the manager of Daiwa Securities SMBC's investment advisory section. "Investors, especially foreign investors, don't like it that the government cannot decide on a new governor in this market environment, including unstable currency moves." The credit crunch and fears of a U.S. recession briefly drove the dollar below 96 yen to a 13-year low on Monday and sent Japanese shares down nearly 4 percent. Stocks made up some lost ground on Tuesday, with the benchmark Nikkei average gaining 1.5 percent, while the dollar held just above 97 yen. Tanami, speaking in parliament after his nomination, warned clouds were gathering over the world's second-largest economy. "Downside risks and uncertainties for Japan's economy are heightening at home and abroad," Tanami told lawmakers. "Under these circumstances, the BOJ needs to carefully analyse various risk factors and make policy decisions decisively without preconceptions." Political analysts said the BOJ fuss would likely further dent Fukuda's already sagging public support and might lead to calls to replace him. But any replacement will face the same divided parliament. A Yomiuri newspaper poll showed public support for Fukuda around 34 percent, with a disapproval rating of 54 percent. But the same poll showed 59 percent unhappy that the Democrat-led opposition parties had vetoed Muto for BOJ governor, showing voters blamed both sides for the stalema
