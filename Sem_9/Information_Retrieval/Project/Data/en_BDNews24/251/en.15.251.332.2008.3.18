<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 18 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Tuesday halted until Monday the hearing on twin writ petitions filed by BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia and ex-student leader Nasiruddin Ahmed Asim over dialogue with the Election Commission. The bench of justices Mirza Hussain Haider and Mamnun Rahman heard the petitions for the 10th day and issued the order. After hearing the petition of Khaleda, the court asked the lawyer of Nasiruddin Ahmed Asim if the two petitions could be disposed of together. Asim's lawyer, Barrister Nawshad, left the matter to the court to decide. The High Court had earlier issued a rule nisi on Asim's petition asking the Election Commission to explain why order would not be given to invite BNP to the dialogue complying with laws and the party constitution and tradition. Dr Kamal Hossain, lawyer for the Election Commission, told the court that only a faction of the BNP would be happy if any verdict were delivered on the writ petition. The other faction would be unhappy." Dr Kamal stopped short of saying a verdict was unnecessary. The lawyer said the two BNP factions had let the EC know of their interest to attend the dialogue after the EC started inviting political parties for the same. "Both groups wanted to attend the dialogue. It is an intra-party dispute. The court should not get involved in it," he added. He said the Nov 22 dialogue had been cancelled, adding: "So there should not be any verdict on anticipation about a future dialogue." Dr Kamal said the BNP should have appointed a mediator to settle the intra-party feud. He said that the decision of the party standing committee could not be an issue of disposal in court. Khaleda's lawyer TH Khan said an influential quarter had plotted to split the BNP through the EC. The HC had earlier frozen the EC invitation to Hafizuddin Ahmed, leader of the Saifur-led faction, for the dialogue after Khaleda Zia filed the writ petition on Nov 18. Asim filed the writ petition on Nov 4. bdnew
