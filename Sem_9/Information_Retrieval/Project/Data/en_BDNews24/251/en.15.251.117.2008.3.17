 Beijing, March 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese security forces did not use lethal weapons on protesters in Tibet's capital, Lhasa, the region's governor said on Monday as troops poured into neighbouring provinces to quell copycat rioting by Tibetans. "I can say with all responsibility we did not use lethal weapons, including opening fire," Qiangba Puncog, the government chief in Tibet, told a news conference in Beijing, adding that only tear gas and water cannon had been used on protesters. He said 13 "innocent civilians" were killed and dozens of security personnel were injured when several days of monk-led protests broadened into riots in which houses and shops were burned and looted last Friday. Exiled representatives of Tibet in Dharamsala, India -- home to Tibetan Buddhists' spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama -- on Sunday put the death toll in Lhasa at 80. Qiangba Puncog said the rioting was premeditated, planned and organised by "external and domestic forces" of the "Dalai clique" and had caused "serious damage" to law and order in Lhasa. The Dalai Lama fled Tibet after a failed 1959 uprising against Chinese rule. Beijing reviles him as a separatist though he says he only wants more autonomy for the region. Capital of the remote and mountainous region of Tibet, Lhasa was under tight police watch on Monday ahead of a midnight deadline set by Tibet's government for protesters to give themselves up to the police. Qiangba Puncog said calm was returning to the city. Foreign reporters are barred from travelling to Tibet without official permission and foreign tourists have been asked to leave. Protests hit ethnic Tibetan areas in the neighbouring Chinese provinces of Sichuan and Gansu on Sunday, reducing the chances of an early end to the instability that is a major challenge to China's leaders just months before it hosts the Olympic Games. A Reuters reporter in Sichuan said he saw columns of trucks filled with armed troops on the roads in ethnic Tibetan areas. In Sichuan's Aba region, two ethnic Tibetans said hundreds of People's Liberation Army vehicles moved in overnight, after unrest in which police said a crowd of Tibetans hurled petrol bombs and set a police station and a market on fire. "They've been driving through all night. It's just tailing off now," the man said, adding that word had spread of protests in other parts of the region as well. In Gansu's Machu town, a crowd of 300-400 carried pictures of the Dalai Lama and shouted slogans as they marched on government buildings, breaking windows and doors and setting fire to Chinese shops and businesses, the Free Tibet Campaign said. The London-based group said 100 Tibetan students staged a sit-in at Northwest Minority University in Gansu's capital, Lanzhou, a worry for a country with a history of student unrest, notably the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 that ended in a bloody military crackdown. CALLS FOR RESTRAINT "If the Tibetans in Lhasa take to the streets again in large numbers and really challenge the Chinese authorities, I think we'll see a very harsh crackdown," said Kenneth Lieberthal, a political scientist at University of Michigan. However, Governor Qiangba Puncog said that while protesters who committed serious crimes would be dealt with harshly, those who showed remorse could expect leniency. Western governments have called on China to exercise restraint and there have been daily pro-Tibet protests around the world since last Monday, the 49th anniversary of the failed uprising against Chinese rule. Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd on Monday said the crackdown in Tibet was disturbing. China's rulers brook no challenge to their rule, and the unrest comes at a time of growing threats to social stability fuelled by inflation and a yawning gap between rich and poor. The Dalai Lama called at the weekend for an investigation into what he called cultural genocide. Communist troops entered Tibet in 1950, after taking power in Beijing. Xinhua quoted Tibetan officials as saying the Nobel peace laureate's charge was "downright nonsense" and trumpeted China's development policies in Tibet. Critics say those policies helped fuel the protesters' anger by favouring Han Chinese migration to the region, contributing to a huge wealth gap between Chinese and Tibetans.
