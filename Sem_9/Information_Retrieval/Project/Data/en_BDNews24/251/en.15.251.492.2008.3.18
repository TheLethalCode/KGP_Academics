 Beijing, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao is holding his annual news conference following the closing session of the National People's Congress, or parliament. Following are highlights: ECONOMY AND EXCHANGE RATES "Recently the impact of the U.S. subprime crisis has led to devaluation of the U.S. dollar, several interest rates cuts and oil prices have stayed consistently high, reaching as high as $110 per barrel. "All of this has had a major impact on global stock markets, which have experienced swings. "I am closely watching and feel deeply worried about the global economic situation, especially the U.S. economy." "China adopts its tight monetary policy and sound fiscal policy in line with China's own situation, which includes overly fast investment growth, excessive money and credit expansion as well as overly rapid growth in the trade surplus. "Global economic developments cannot but have an impact on China. Therefore, at the same time as pursuing these policies, we must pay close attention to international economic developments and, based on changing trends, be flexible and timely in adopting corresponding countermeasures. "The outcome of these policies must be viewed in the medium to long term. It is very difficult to see them in a short one or two months. "What concerns me now is the continuous depreciation of the U.S. dollar and when the dollar will hit bottom." He said the yuan's exchange rate is set by market forces of supply and demand but with reference to a basket of currencies. "Up till now, the yuan has appreciated 15 percent against the dollar in the last two years, and the pace of appreciation has been accelerating recently. "The fundamentals of the Chinese economy are sound. We are confident of China's economic prospects." POLITICAL RIGHTS He said China wants to ratify the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights "as quickly as possible". But China had to work on reconciling its domestic laws with international standards. Asked about Tuesday's trial of leading dissident Hu Jia: "I can say clearly that this is a country of rule of law, and these issues will be handled according to the law. He said the charge that Hu was on trial just for being a dissident was "spun out of thin air". OLYMPICS "We need to respect the principles of the Olympics and the Olympic charter. That is, we should not politicise the Olympic Games."

"We need to vigorously develop agriculture." He said rural investment in particular must be expanded so farmers' incomes keep rising steadily. "We need to ensure that grain and other agricultural output will increase in a stable manner." China needs to create 50 million jobs in the next five years: "We need to continue pursuing a proactive employment policy." "We need to work very hard to attain the goals we set in the 11th five-year plan in terms of conservation of resources and energy and reduction of pollution and emissions so we can markedly improve the natural environment." "We need to continue strengthening and improving macro controls." TAIWAN "We hope to resume peace talks across the Straits under the one China principle as soon as possible. Any questions can be addressed, including such major issues as ending the hostile state between the two sides." For a full story, double-click on [ID:nPEK308754] NEED FOR GROWTH "China is a developing country with 1.3 billion people. We have to maintain a certain degree of fast economic growth to provide enough jobs. "We have to strike a balance between economic growth and inflation. Setting targets of 8 percent GDP growth and 4.8 percent CPI for this year aims to do that. "As I've said before, 2008 might be the most troublesome year for China's economy. Why? Because international and domestic uncertainties are making it difficult to make decisions. "We have to closely the watch changes and trends in economic developments and adopt timely and flexible measures, as well as control the pace, direction and forcefulness of macro controls in order to ensure stable and fairly fast economic growth. "This can also help us create jobs for about 10 million people a year, while effectively curbing inflation. "Maintaining stable and fairly fast economic growth while curbing inflation is not a target just for this year, but for the next five years. "We also have to continue with active policies to create jobs in order to create 50 million jobs in five years. "I have a very firm conviction that we should never shy away from the difficulties, take responsibility and stride ahead. "We have to strengthen macro controls and adjustments and give full play to market forces in allocating resources." TIBET RIOTING "There is ample fact and plenty of evidence proving this incident was organised, premeditated, masterminded and incited by the Dalai clique. "This has all the more revealed the consistent claims by the Dalai clique that they pursue not independence but peaceful dialogue are nothing but lies. Those claims that the Chinese government is engaged in cultural genocide are nothing but lies.

To be honest with you, it's not easy to achieve this goal, especially given that we suffered very rare snowstorms in the first two months of this year. "This brings us even greater pressure to curb prices. "But we still haven't changed the goal. This is for two reasons. First, it shows the government's determination to make controlling price rises and curbing inflation the biggest priorities for us this year. "Secondly, it can help stablise residents' inflationary expectations. When prices rise fairly fast, inflationary expectations become more dangerous than price rises themselves. "We also have reasons to set such an inflation target. Our current stock of grain reserves is between 150 million and 200 million tonnes; the situation of oversupply of major industrial products has not changed. For a separate story on grains reserves, please double-click on [ID:nPEK284464]. "So as long as we come up with appropriate policies and effective measures, we are fully confident that we can control the situation of excessive price rises." CURRENT PREOCCUPATIONS Wen said he was concerned with four main issues. "First is to ensure stable and fairly fast economic growth in China while effectively controlling inflation. This requires us to resolve the problems of economic instability, lack of coordination and unsustainability. "The biggest difficulty now is excessive price rises and the resulting inflationary pressures. This could bring some hidden risks of economic fluctuations. So we have to carefully tread the path between these two choices." The other three issues he mentioned were needing breakthroughs in the reform of the political and economic systems, promoting social justice and equity and fostering the building of social ethics.
