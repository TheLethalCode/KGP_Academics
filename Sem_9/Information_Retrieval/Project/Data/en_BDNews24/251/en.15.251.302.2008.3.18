 Vancouver, British Columbia, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Vancouver-area man has been arrested for alleging raising funds for the Tamil Tigers, which has been declared a terrorist organization by Canada, police said on Monday. Prapaharan Thambithurai was arrested Friday on charges of illegally raising money for "terrorist purposes" by getting Canadian residents of Tamil heritage to make cash donations to the separatist group, police said. The rebel group has been fighting for an independent homeland in Sri Lanka since the early 1980s, and was added to Canada's list of outlawed organizations in 2006.
