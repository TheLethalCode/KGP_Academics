 Rangpur, March 16 (bdnews24.com)The army chief, General Moeen U Ahmed, Sunday urged people to choose honest candidates in the next elections and said good leadership was necessary for development in the country. Moeen also asked the people to stay alert against vote buying and said: "If the dishonest people become winners by buying votes for the next five years they will try to make up for the money spent and earn more." "They will not work for welfare of people," the army chief said, speaking at the inauguration of a sewing training centre at Begum Rokeya Memorial Complex in Pairaband of the northern district of Rangpur. "The registration of five crore voters has already been completed with the help of the army. Work on voter listing will be completed by July. The number of voters may exceed the eight crore mark," Moeen said. Moeen expressed concern over spiralling prices of essential commodities and said: "The prices of essentials have doubled. Prices of food and oil have increased much. Rice now sells at Tk 32 to Tk 33 a kg. Despite all, the country did not plunge into famine, he said. "We said none would die from starvation. In the wake of Cyclone Sidr, we had said we would not let anybody die without food and treatment." "The army has succeeded in facing the disaster with the help of all including the administration." Moeen said: "There is a food crisis in the country, but it is not possible to meet the crisis by importing food from abroad alone. Although we have the financial capacity to buy food from abroad we have to meet demand by increasing local output." "For this, supply of fertiliser, diesel and other agricultural inputs to farmers must be ensured." BKMEA president Falzul Hoque, Dhaka University history professor Syed Anwar Hossain, Jahangirnagar University archaeology professor Kamarul Hasan and Rajshahi divisional commissioner Hafizar Rahman Bhuiyan also spoke. The army and BKMEA officials received the army chief when he reached Begum Rokeya Memorial Complex. At the inaugural function, he also unwrapped the book "History and Heritage of Greater Rangpur-Dinajpur Region in Photographs" edited by Lt Col Nazrul Islam. bdnews2
