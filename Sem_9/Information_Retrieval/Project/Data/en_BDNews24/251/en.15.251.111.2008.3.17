 London, March 17 (bdnews24.com)Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed has said relations between Bangladesh and the UK are multidimensional and evolving. "The UK is Bangladesh's one of the biggest investors, a big source of remittance and the third biggest export market," Fakhruddin said. The chief adviser called upon the Bangladeshis in the UK to help build a stronger economy and democratic Bangladesh by further strengthening the existing "close and meaningful" relations between the two countries. But the relations between the two countries are not limited to economic activities, he said. Expatriate Bangladeshis have important contributions in the social, economic and political areas in the UK, the CA said in his address to the Bangladeshi community there, at a programme organised by the Bangladesh High Commission in London Sunday evening (London time). The chief adviser thanked the UK government and the expatriate Bangladeshis for cooperation in relief and rehabilitation activities in the aftermath of twin floods and Cyclone Sidr that ravaged Bangladesh. Fakhruddin informed the expatriate Bangladeshis about different programmes taken and implemented by the government for reforms and to make the economy dynamic. Fakhruddin said the government wants to increase participation of the expatriates in economic activities, referring to a government initiative to implement the recommendations of the 2007 Dhaka conference for non-resident Bangladeshis as an "expression of its positive attitude". The chief adviser recalled the immense contribution of the expatriate Bangladeshis in the UK in the independence struggle and in reconstruction of the war-ravaged country. Fakhruddin said the government had taken into account the manpower export with importance. In 2007, 8.32 lakh workers received clearance for employment abroad, up from 3.81 lakh in 2006. The chief adviser said an acceptable election and institutional reforms or reconstruction are the government's strategy to reach its goal. He mentioned that the Election Commission's full independence has been ensured. "The commission is now working independently," he claimed. The price hike in Bangladesh, the CA said, affected the group with limited income. He mentioned different steps including duty cuts to keep the prices of essentials within a tolerable limit. Foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury, Bangladesh high commissioner Shafi U Ahmed and the chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim were present at the programme. bd
