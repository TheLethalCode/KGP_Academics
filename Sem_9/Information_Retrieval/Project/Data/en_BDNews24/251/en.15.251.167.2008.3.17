 LONDON, March 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's leading share index skidded 2.6 percent by midday on Monday as financials were lashed by fears the fire sale of US bank Bear Stearns signalled the credit market crisis would claim more victims. Alliance & Leicester and HBOS both slid more than 10 percent, while Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays both lost nearly 8 percent. Investors shunned the sector after JPMorgan announced a takeover of Bear Stearns at a rock-bottom price, and ahead of a set of key investment bank results due this week. By 1139 GMT the FTSE 100 was down 146 points at 5,485.7, hitting its lowest level since the end of January as Europe tracked steep falls in Asia and US stock futures tumbled. The index has shed 15 percent so far this year on investor fears of a possible US recession and further credit-related writedowns. In a shock move on Sunday, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) cut its discount rate by a further quarter point to 3.25 percent and launched a new facility that would allow US primary dealers, mainly investment banks, to tap the discount window in a tool not used since the Great Depression. "The Fed's in a new phase now of making pretty unusual policy steps... It's bringing home to people just how serious the situation is," said Chris Iggo, a strategist at Axa Investments. "The US banking system's in a pretty precarious position at the moment," he said. "In the short term, the situation remains very dangerous." The dollar plunged across the board, and US short-term interest rate futures pointed to a near certainty the Fed would cut rates by 1 percentage point at or before Tuesday's policy meeting. The Bank of England's exceptional offer of 5 billion pounds worth of 3-day loans to calm money markets on Monday was nearly five times oversubscribed. Bucking the trend, however, UK nuclear power company British Energy Group rose about 10 percent after saying it was in talks which could lead to a business combination or an offer for the company. GlaxoSmithKline shares, the only other FTSE 100 gainers, added 2.4 percent following incremental good news on drugs and appreciation of its strong dividend, analysts said. bdnews24.com/lq/1852hrs WOLSELEY HIT Building materials group Wolseley lost 5.4 percent after it reported a 23 percent fall in first-half trading profit and warned that business conditions in its major markets, which includes the United States, would become more challenging. Among energy stocks, BP, BG Group and Tullow Oil all fell with the wider market, shrugging off rising US crude oil prices. Royal Dutch Shell reversed earlier gains to trade flat. It said earlier that its oil and gas reserves held stable in 2007 despite expectations of a drop, but added its growing focus on unconventional projects would limit growth until after 2010. Miners all fell as copper prices dropped on global growth concerns. Kazakhmys shed 7.5 percent, Vedanta fell 5.1 percent and Antofagasta dropped 6.9 percent. Mitchells & Butlers dropped 8.5 percent after Panmure cut the stock to "sell" from "hold" and cut its price target to 350 pence from 500 pence. The Sunday Times cited people close to the company as saying the pub operator, up for sale, will consider selling a minority stake to private equity firms in return for cash in the hope of giving it enoug
