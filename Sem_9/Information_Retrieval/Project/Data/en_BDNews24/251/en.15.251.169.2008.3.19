 Kuala lampur, March 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Malaysia's former home minister resigned from political party posts on Wednesday after being dropped from cabinet, but denied that the move heralded a split caused by growing unhappiness in the premier's party. Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi dropped several veterans from his cabinet this week, in a bid to shore up credibility after his ruling Barisan Nasional, or National Front, coalition suffered the worst election setback in its history this month. Abdullah's UMNO party is a key component of the ruling coalition, which lost its two-thirds majority in federal parliament and five of Malaysia's 13 states to opposition parties in the March 8 election. "When you are not made a minister, you cannot work effectively as a secretary-general for UMNO," former home minister Radzi Sheikh Ahmad said, referring to his post in Abdullah's party, the United Malays National Organisation. Asked if he had resigned over not being included in the new cabinet, he replied, "You can take it that way." Radzi, 66, said Abdullah had accepted his resignation with immediate effect from the position of secretary-general, both in the premier's party and in the ruling coalition, but denied that his departure signalled a split in the party. "I don't think so," he told reporters in the Malaysian capital when asked if the move foreshadowed such cracks. "I don't belong to some faction." In the cabinet reshuffle, Abdullah dropped long-serving trade minister Rafidah Aziz, but retained his deputy, Najib Razak, as the defence minister, left his economic team almost intact, and gave Radzi's old job to former Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar.
