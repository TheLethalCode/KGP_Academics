 Dhaka, March 17 (bdnews24.,com) - Bangladesh look for their first one-day triumph Tuesday after the World Cup when the Tigers take on Ireland in the three-ODI series opener at Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium (SBNS). The match starts at 9:30am with state-run television BTV telecasting the match live from the venue. "It is not a match of revenge, rather we are getting three more one-dayers to play and we will want to get the first win since we have remained winless after the World Cup," said Bangladesh captain Mohammad Ashraful at a pre-match briefing at the SBNS conference room Monday. In the last ICC World Cup in the West Indies, Bangladesh stunned cricket world to make big upset beating India on way to their first-ever super-eight berths where they again tamed top-ranking South Africa, but they surprisingly went 74-runs down against Ireland in their first-ever appearance. After two disappointing series against New Zealand and South Africa, the Tigers are certainly going through low confidence, but Bangladesh captain believes it would not affect their performing well against Ireland. He, however, did not want to take the Irish lightly, and believed his side would get the home advantage against the visitors on the slow and low wicket. "We felt no pressure and want to concentrate on the series opener and play match by match," said Ashraful. "We will try to put our best and hope we will come out of successfully if we can execute our plan accordingly," said the 23-year old cricketer. Coach Jamie Siddons said their preparation was good though things were difficult against South Africa, the boys were fired up and all set to go. "It would be nice if we could win and I am pretty confident that we will win. But there are lots of cricket to play. They (Ireland) are a good cricket team.... I think our team rule and play with the best of their ability and I'm pretty sure if they can play to their ability, they can be successful," said Siddons. He, however, emphasised the need to play each ball considering its merit. "We need to put process in place. Of course it's an opportunity. But we have to play the first ball on merit and then the next ball We have got to play good cricket and the result will take care of itself." On the other hand, Ireland captain Trent Johnston said they had come here to be very competitive after having a two-week good preparation in Abu Dhabi. "We think we can walk away with the series victory.... Bangladesh are going through a tough period at the moment. Hopefully we can capitalize on that. Bangladesh are favourite to win the series, but we can also have a ride," said Johnston. The Irish captain, however, was a bit worried over the conditions here. "We have beaten them in the World Cup, but that's a different situation. Now we are here. We are not used to these conditions. But if we can do well in three disciplines, we are going to be competitive. It's going to be a tough challenge," said Johnston. The Bangladesh team management has kept opener Junaed Siddique and middle order Nazimuddin out of the 12-member squad with keeping three spinners in the fold. Bangladesh 12-member squad: Tamim Iqbal, Shahriar Nafees, Aftab Ahmed, Mohammad Ashraful, Shakib Al Hasan, Roqibul Hasan, Dhiman Ghosh, Abdur Razzak, Mahmudullah Riad, Farhad Reza, Mashrafee Bin Mortaza and Shahadat Hossain.
