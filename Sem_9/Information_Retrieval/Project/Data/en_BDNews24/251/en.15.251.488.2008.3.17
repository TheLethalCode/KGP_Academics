<TITLE> Iran elections conceal democratic deficit:Ebadi </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TEHRAN, March 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran uses elections to mask a lack of true democracy in its tightly controlled system, Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin Ebadi said. She said she had not voted in Friday's parliamentary poll, in which conservatives loyal to clerical rule in the 29-year-old Islamic Republic kept their grip on the 290-seat assembly. "Why should I vote when I believe the election is not free and I don't know any of the candidates?" Ebadi asked. "The first step in a democracy is for people to be able to vote for whomever they want to," she told Reuters in an interview on Sunday night in her basement office on a quiet Tehran sidestreet. "But people are not free to choose, only to vote for those approved by the Guardian Council. Such an election cannot be classified as free," the 60-year-old lawyer declared. Only about 60 percent of the 7,600 would-be candidates survived a vetting process by government committees and the Guardian Council, an unelected body of 12 clerics and jurists. Those barred included many from the reformist camp that sought to improve Iran's human rights record when former President Mohammad Khatami was in power from 1997 to 2005. Ebadi, who won the Nobel prize in 2003, said anyone who had criticised the government was liable to be disqualified. She acknowledged that democracy in Iran was healthier than in neighbours like Saudi Arabia, which holds no national elections, but said it fell far short of Iranian aspirations. Elections in Iran functioned as a tool for the government to "confirm existing conditions" and to tell the world that the system has public support simply because Iranians have voted. The authorities have said more than 60 percent of Iran's 44 million voters turned out on Friday. Reformists as well as their conservative opponents had urged Iranians to vote. WESTERN CRITICISM The European Union called the election "neither fair nor free" and the United States said it was "cooked". Iran regularly rejects such Western criticism as meddling in its affairs. "I have my personal objections to human rights violations in the United States," Ebadi said, recalling that she had criticised the Guantanamo prison camp in her Nobel acceptance speech. "But human rights is an international concept. "For the same reason that the Iranian government gives itself the right to talk about (Israeli) violations of human rights in Palestine, anyone in the world has the right to talk about human rights in this country." Ebadi, wearing the headscarf prescribed by Iran's religious authorities, said her country's human rights record had regressed in the past two years, citing what she said was a rising number of political prisoners and the highest number of executions per capita in the world last year. "Freedom of speech is decreasing and many Internet sites are being filtered," she said through an interpreter. Ebadi blamed the West's intense focus on Iran's disputed nuclear programme for diverting attention from rights issues. "They have tended to ignore or forget human rights conditions in Iran. That's why the situation is getting worse." Blocking a draft family law "against the interests of women and children" by threatening a sit-in outside parliament was the only achievement Ebadi could point to in the past two years. Her Centre for Defenders of Human Rights is providing legal aid to political detainees and financial support to their families. Ebadi said she and her colleagues were also defending about 50 women charged over a campaign to collect a million signatures for a petition in favour of women's rights in Iran. "They are calling for human rights, but in court they have been accused of acting against national security," she said. Under laws passed since Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution, a woman's testimony is deemed to be worth half that of a man, Ebadi said. In car accidents, a woman can expect only half the compensation due to a man. A man can marry four wives and divorce at will. It is hard for a woman to seek divorce. Over the years, Ebadi's struggle has earned her a spell in jail and, she says, a stream of threatening letters and telephone calls. The diminutive mother of two seems unfazed. "When you believe in the correctness of your work, there is no reason to be afraid of anything," she shrugg
