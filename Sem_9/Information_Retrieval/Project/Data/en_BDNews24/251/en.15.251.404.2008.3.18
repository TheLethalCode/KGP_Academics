<TEXT>
 LONDON, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's FTSE 100 share index rose 1.5 percent early on Tuesday, buoyed by expectations of a big U.S. rate cut and led by banks recovering some ground after dropping on Monday following the firesale of Bear Stearns. At 0902 GMT the index was up 96.1 points at 5,510.5 after hitting its lowest closing level since late 2005 on Monday. Overnight, the Dow Industrials rose, while Japanese stocks snapped a three-day losing streak on Monday, after JPMorgan Chase & Co's deal to buy struggling brokerage Bear Stearns at a rock bottom price for $2 per share. On the economic front, the US Federal Reserve is expected to deliver one of the steepest interest rate cuts since 1982 after the market close in an attempt to boost turbulent credit markets. There was also market talk that other central banks may take action to ease the nervousness within the investment community. UK banking and financials benefited from the positive sentiment, accounting for over 19 index points. Among individual stocks, Barclays, HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland gained between 1 and 3 percent. Man Group added 4.9 percent. "Slightly predictable rebound given the fact that yesterday's sell-off was fairly severe and it closed on the low," said Tim Hughes, head of sales trading at IG Index. "Overnight people have had a chance to chew the fat a little bit and think, this is still a financial sector problem." "Yes, it has the potential to roll over (but) we're expecting the Fed to act decisively today." "(But) if you are to believe the majority of analysts and economists, the consensus of opinion does seem to be that things are likely to get worse before they get better," he said. Hughes added that results from Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs later today would be keenly watched by investors. Insurers were also higher with Old Mutual up 3.3 percent and Prudential up 3 percent. Legal & General was volatile however, falling first but recovering to trade up 3.4 percent despite saying its 2007 profit fell 26 percent, missing analysts' expectations after making a 269 million pound charge to account for Britons living longer. "These results are unlikely to rock the market but are robust nonetheless," Collins Stewart analyst Tim Young said. "We would have preferred a rebased dividend now and greater clarity on future capital releases but in such an uncertain market for financial assets this represents prudence on the company's part." In mining shares, Rio Tinto added 3.2 percent. Chinese aluminium giant Chinalco, which this year led a $14 billion investment in Rio, is more likely to raise its stake than reduce it, its president said on Tuesday. Europe's biggest travel firm TUI Travel gained 3.8 percent after it said its key summer holiday bookings remained strong across the group and it was on track to hit 2008 profit forecasts and merger cost-saving targets. BSkyB advanced 2.7 percent after the pay-TV operator won the right to show the majority of Champions League soccer matches from 2009 to 2012. The European governing body of soccer, UEFA, said BSkyB emerged as the clear winner for a number of rights packages including exclusive coverage of all live matches and highlights on a Tuesday and all games on a Wednesday with the exception of the first choice fixture. Among the few decliners, building materials group Wolseley slipped a further 0.8 percent having reported a fall in first-half profits on Monday. Both Citigroup and Panmure cut their price ratings on the stock. In midcaps, department stores group Debenhams rose 5.6 percent after like-for-like sales fell a slightly worse than expected 0.7 percent in the first half of its financial year and it said it expected the retail environment to remain tou
