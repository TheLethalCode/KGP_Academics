 Dhaka, March 17 (bdnews24.com) Politicians at a seminar Monday said that only a people's representative government elected through a peaceful election could resolve the crisis the country was facing. They stressed that the parliamentary election must be held in line with the roadmap. Awami League leader, Abdus Shahid, said that there was no alternative to polls: "The election has to be held as soon as possible. Power must be handed over to the representatives of the people to recover from the crisis." Jatiya Party leader, GM Quader, stressed holding of local elections along with the parliamentary polls. "Election is a must to open the door of democracy," he said. Former caretaker adviser, Mahbubul Alam, said that the election must be accepted and participated in by all parties. Dr Osman Gani, president of the Society for Bangladesh Development Strategy that organised the seminar at the Jatiya Press Club, made a 23-point recommendation to the government. The recommendations included initiatives to strike a balance between the power of the resident and the prime minister, compulsory registration of political parties with the Election Commission, speeding up the process of corruption trials and initiating the trial of war criminals. bdne
