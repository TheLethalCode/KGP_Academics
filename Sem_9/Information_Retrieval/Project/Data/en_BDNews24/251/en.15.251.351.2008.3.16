 Dhaka, March 16 (bdnews24.com)House speaker Muhammad Jamiruddin Sircar said Sunday the caretaker government must prioritise national elections over local government polls. Sircar said the government failed to hold elections in 90 days from the dissolution of parliament. "But it is not an illegal government but an irregular one," he said in his address as chief guest to the launch of the "Strengthening the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) Project" at Sonargaon Hotel. The parliament's PAC is responsible for examination of annual audited accounts of public spending. PAC receives reports from the auditor general and plays an active role in recommending corrective actions to ministries, based on the reports. At the programme co-organised by the Bangladesh parliament secretariat and the World Bank's Dhaka office, Sircar said: "The caretaker government was formed to hold the Jatiya Sangsad elections. So national elections should be its top priority." Later replying to reporters the speaker said: "The caretaker government is a creation of the constitution. Article 58 of the constitution has specified the work area of the government. This government will do routine work and will assist in holding the elections at the same time." "The constitution mentions when the elections will be held. It is not right that there is no limit to a government's tenure. Elections have to be held within 90 days of the dissolution of the Jatiya Sangsad," he said. Sircar questioned why the government would hold local government elections before the national polls and said: "Holding national elections is the main task of the caretaker government, not the local elections. But the matter is up to people to decide." On the oversight functions of PAC, World Bank country director Xian Zhu, who also attended the programme, said: "Accountability as we all understand is not optional in a democracy. It is the price in exchange for power and delegation of authority. In Bangladesh as elsewhere, the primary responsibility for ensuring financial accountability rests with the government." Xian Zhu said parliamentary oversight committees ensure completion of the "accountability loop". "If the principle of openness is practised, I'm sure the PAC will not only help create a strong chain of accountability but  will deter all avenues of misuse of public funds." bdnews
