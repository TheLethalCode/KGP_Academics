<TITLE> Hong Kong prostitute deaths spark serial killer fear </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Hong Kong, March 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hong Kong police are investigating the murder of three sex workers in the past few days, with police keeping open the possibility on Monday that a single serial killer might be responsible. Since Saturday, three prostitutes, all in their 30's, have been found murdered in their ransacked apartments in two districts in Hong Kong's northern New Territories. The first two women had been robbed and strangled to death, one with a hose, while the third was certified dead with no apparent injuries early on Monday morning. "We are adopting a very open-minded approach, we will rigorously pursue all lines of inquiries," said Steve Li, a police superintendent, when asked if a serial killer may have been responsible for the three crimes. "We can't rule out the possibility that either one or more persons carried out these crimes," he told reporters. The triple murders in Tai Po and Yuen Long have sent ripples of fear through Hong Kong's large prostitution community. Murders of prostitutes are rare in Hong Kong. In 2003 and 2004, a retired Chinese PLA soldier killed two sex workers during a visit to the former British colony. A brief police statement put out early on Monday said the third victim, a 35-year old woman, had been found in her ransacked Tai Po flat, with police saying all three cases carried a "high degree of similarity". Zi Teng, Hong Kong's most established help group for sex workers, told Reuters the three murdered women were among some 1,800 women who advertised in local newspapers for services rendered in the privacy of their own apartments. The so-called "one flat, one phoenix" set-up lowers the chance of prosecution compared with working out of a brothel, but often leaves women vulnerable to dangerous clients, Zi Teng said. "We are very concerned about these incidents and we hope that some action is taken to protect these girls," said Elaine Lam, a spokeswoman with Zi Teng. While there are no official statistics on the size of Hong Kong's sex industry, experts say there are at least 100,000 women working at any given time, consisting mostly of a transient pool of women from China's impoverished inland provinces.
