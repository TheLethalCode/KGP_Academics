 MADRID, March 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Betis's Primera Liga match against Athletic Bilbao was abandoned on Saturday after visiting goalkeeper Armando was struck by a bottle thrown by a fan. Bilbao were leading 2-1 during the second half at the Manuel Ruiz de Lopera stadium when a fan behind the goal threw what looked like a small plastic bottle full of liquid at Armando. The keeper, who had gone to get the ball for a goalkick, was treated on the pitch and taken off on a stretcher. Referee Carlos Clos Gomez stopped the game with about 18 minutes left. "Armando suffered a blow to the right eye and has bruising and a cut in the same area. He has had stitches," Bilbao said on their Web site (www.athletic-club.net). Later, on La Sexta televsion channel, Bilbao's head of medical services Paco Angulo said the player was to have further tests on his eye on Sunday. Betis condemned the incident on their Web site (www.realbetisbalompie.es). "The aggressor was immediately detained by the stadium's private security and will be prevented from attending future sporting events," the club said. It is not the first time such an incident has occurred at the Manuel Ruiz de Lopera. Last season, Sevilla coach Juande Ramos, now at Tottenham Hotspur, was knocked out after being hit by a bottle thrown from the stands during a King's Cup quarter-final match there. That game was abandoned and the remaining 33 minutes played behind closed doors at Getafe's stadium while Betis were hit with a three-match stadium ban
