 Dhaka, March 17 (bdnews24.com)  There will be no third umpire when the three-ODI series between hosts Bangladesh and Ireland gets underway Tuesday at Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. "Due to equipment constraints, no Third Umpire referrals will be made and all decisions will be taken by the on-field umpires," said a Bangladesh Cricket Board press release Monday. The state-run BTV, will however, telecast all three matches live from the venue. All matches start at 9:30am. Local Enamul Hoque Moni and Sri Lankan Tyron Wijewardena will umpire the first and third matches (March 22) while Nadir Shah and Wijewardena will stand in the second one-dayer on March 20. Ranjan Madugalle of Sri Lanka has been appointed match referee for the series.
