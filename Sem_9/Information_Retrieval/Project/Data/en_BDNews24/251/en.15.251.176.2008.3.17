 LONDON, March 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid and Bayern Munich both had their leads cut in the Primera Liga and Bundesliga respectively after suffering away defeats. Manchester United gained the psychological edge in the Premier League after Arsenal lost ground with a fourth successive draw, while in Italy, Inter Milan ended a troubled week by restoring their six-point lead at the top of Serie A. ENGLAND Manchester United took pole position in the race for the Premier League title with a 1-0 win at Derby County, while Arsenal stuttered again to draw 1-1 at home with Middlesbrough. Cristiano Ronaldo got United's winner 14 minutes from time while Kolo Toure's 86th-minute header saved a point for Arsenal. However, the Londoners' fourth successive draw allowed United to go top on goal difference, with a game in hand. United have 67 points from 29 matches, Arsenal have 67 from 30 while Chelsea are still in the hunt on 64 from 29 after a 1-0 win at Sunderland. Liverpool gained ground in the chase for fourth as they came from behind to beat Reading 2-1 at Anfield while Everton lost 1-0 at second-last Fulham, where the Merseysiders have not gained a point since 1966, to fall three points behind. SPAIN Real Madrid's lead was cut to seven points in the Primera Liga this weekend after the champions lost 1-0 away to Deportivo Coruna on Saturday. An own-goal from Portugal defender Pepe was all that separated the sides in a dull clash, as Real's Riazor jinx extended to 16 seasons without a win in La Coruna. Second-placed Barcelona, on 55 points, failed to make the most of their chance. They were held to a 2-2 draw at promoted Almeria on Sunday. Bojan Krkic and Samuel Eto'o twice put Barca ahead but poor defending at corners and the dismissal of Gabriel Milito 18 minutes from time were their undoing. Villarreal climbed to within two points of Barca with a 2-0 home win over Real Zaragoza, while Atletico Madrid remain fourth on 47 after a comfortable 3-0 home win over bottom club Levante. ITALY Inter Milan beat Palermo 2-1 at home on Sunday to restore the champions' six-point lead at the top of Serie A after a troubled week. Goals by Patrick Vieira and Luis Jimenez settled nerves at the club after coach Roberto Mancini said he was leaving at the end of the season following Tuesday's Champions League last 16 defeat by Liverpool. Mancini changed his mind the following day. Inter have 67 points from 28 games, while second-placed AS Roma have 61 after coming from behind to beat AC Milan 2-1 on Saturday. Juventus, who are seven points behind Roma in third, beat Napoli in the late Sunday game thanks to an 88th-minute strike by substitute Vincenzo Iaquinta. Fifth-placed Milan are now four points adrift of the Champions League qualification zone. GERMANY Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich suffered a shock 2-0 defeat at lowly Energie Cottbus on Saturday, only their second league defeat of the season. Hamburg SV moved ahead of slumping Werder Bremen, beaten 1-0 by VfL Wolfsburg, into second with a 1-0 win over Borussia Dortmund. Bayer Leverkusen climbed to third with a 4-1 win over Nuremberg. Bayern, who had a seven-point lead going into the weekend, have 50 points, five more than second-placed Habburg. Leverkusen are on 44 and Bremen have 43. Serbian striker Branko Jelic scored two first-half goals for Cottbus, who moved off the bottom of the table after recording only their fourth win of the season. FRANCE Olympique Lyon continued their march towards a record seventh consecutive title with a 3-0 win at Monaco on Saturday. Lyon scored all their goals before the break, with Kader Keita showing them the way with a superb strike from the edge of the box on 20 minutes. Striker Fred doubled the advantage from close range and three minutes later, Keita exploited a defensive blunder to flick the ball over Monaco goalkeeper Stephane Ruffier. Lyon have 61 points from 29 games, six ahead of second-placed Girondins Bordeaux, who beat Racing Strasbourg 3-0. Third-placed Nancy drew 1-1 at Sochaux and still enjoy a three-point edge over Olympique Marseille, who wasted a two-goal lead in a 3-3 draw at struggling RC Lens on Sunday. NETHERLANDS Luis Suarez scored a hat-trick to inspire Ajax Amsterdam to a 4-1 victory over Willem II Tilburg. The result narrowed PSV Eindhoven's lead to four points after they were held to a 1-1 draw at Roda JC Kerkrade. Jefferson Farfan opened the scorings for PSV Eindhoven midway through the second half but Marcel Meeuwis struck from close range to salvage a point in stoppage time. Third place Feyenoord cruised to a 4-1 home win over VVV Venlo and have 54 point
