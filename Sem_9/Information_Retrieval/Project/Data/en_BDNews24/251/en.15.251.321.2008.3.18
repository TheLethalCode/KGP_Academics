 LONDON, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Central London property firm Derwent London said on Tuesday adjusted net asset value per share rose 8.4 percent but deepening financial sector turmoil threatened prospects in the city's stalwart West End market. Derwent said 2007 net asset value per share rose to 1,862 pence and recurring profit before tax more than doubled to 38 million pounds ($76.12 million) from 16.4 million a year ago. Derwent shares had gained 4.4 percent to 1,477 pence by 1019 GMT, against a 2.5 percent rise in the FTSE 350 Real Estate Index. Chairman Robert Rayne said he expected a more demanding property market going forward as the U.S and European credit market meltdown continued to chip away at confidence and liquidity. "At present, the investment market is experiencing some instability and equilibrium will only return when there is a consistent deal flow," said Rayne. He said London's West End market -- traditionally seen as Britain's most robust office market -- could become the next real estate casualty of the crisis. "Currently demand for space in the West End remains firm for the limited available space. However, in the event of a general economic slowdown, even in this distinctive area, rental growth is likely to be affected," said Rayne. Analysts at JPMorgan described the Derwent results as "solid" and reiterated their overweight recommendation of the stock. MID-MARKET RENTS Derwent said a dip in occupier demand and rental growth would likely play into their hands, as rents at its signature, design-led offices were more "economic", ranging between 40 and 65 pounds per square foot, compared with prime West End rents which have topped 120 pounds per square foot in recent times. It completed 21,900 square metres of lettings in 81 transactions during the year, generating additional rental income of 8.3 million pounds, some 18 percent above valuers' estimated rental values. "Our focus on properties offering mid-market rents provides relative resilience and many of the group's most successful projects were originally acquired in similarly testing markets," said Rayne. While property values in Britain have slipped around 15 percent since June, Derwent said the book value of its 2.7 billion pounds portfolio rose by 90.3 million pounds in the period. With balance sheet gearing of 43 percent and unused bank facilities of 370 million pounds, Derwent said it was well positioned not only to face, but to profit from these "challenging times". However, the firm's finance costs more than doubled in the period, from 20.4 million pounds to 49.1 million pounds following the takeover of London Merchant Securities last year, which contributed to a rise in group net debt to 782.8 million pounds in 2007 from 349.8 million pounds in 2006. Derwent achieved an underlying property return of 11.2 percent in 2007, outperforming a 5.7 percent Investment Property Databank benchmark return for West End offices and the All Property Index, which delivered minus 4.4 percent in 20
