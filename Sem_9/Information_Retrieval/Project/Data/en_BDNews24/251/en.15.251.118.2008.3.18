 Abdur Rahim Harmachhi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, March 18 (bdnews24.com)  The government has planned to slash the Annual Development Programme (ADP) to Tk 22,500 crore from Tk 26,500 crore apparently for the administration's failure to use the allocation for the current fiscal year. The interim government has used only 25 percent of the total allocation of the ADP in July-January of the current fiscal year while it was 40 percent during the same period in fiscal 2006-07, according to the statistics of the Planning Commission. Officials have said the sluggish implementation of the annual plan has prompted the government to slice down the total allocation. Planning secretary Jafar Ahmed Chowdhury told bdnews24.com on Monday: "The ministry has decided to slash the size of the ADP to Tk 22,500 crore. But everything will be finalised in a meeting of the Executive Committee of National Economic Council (Ecnec) on March 24." A draft on the ADP for fiscal 2008-09 will also be placed before the meeting, he said. Economists in a pre-budget consultation advised the government Monday to speed up the implementation of the ADP. The economists also asked the government not to go for an ambitious ADP for the upcoming fiscal year. In a post meeting briefing, finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Monday told reporters: "The economists advised the government to speed up the ADP implementation (for the current fiscal year). They also asked the government to keep the size of the ADP for fiscal 2008-09 small and manageable." The adviser had said the government would give importance to the suggestions by the economists. According to the Bangladesh Economic Review, the size of the ADP for fiscal 2006-07 was Tk 26,000 crore but at the end of the year the plan had been slashed by Tk 4,400 crore. In fiscal 2005-06, the ADP was for Tk 24,500 crore but later it had been cut down to Tk 21,500 crore. But the government could not even implement the amended ADP in the previous fiscal years. bdnews24.
