 Dhaka, March 17 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court has deferred once more the proceedings in a graft case against Awami League president and former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, involving illegal contracts for setting up three barge-mounted power plants. Judge Md Firoz Alam of Special Judge's Court-1, set up on the Sangsad Bhaban premises, adjourned proceedings Monday until March 23 as Hasina was unable to appear in court. Sheikh Hasina was admitted to Square Hospital on March 11. Specialist doctors have advised that she should be sent abroad for appropriate medical treatment. The same court had previously deferred the hearing for the same reason on March 13 to March 17 (Monday). Among the other accused in the case, former power secretary Toufique-e-Elahi Chowdhury was present in the court. The rest are presently fugitive. The former prime minister was produced before court on March 9, when her defense lawyers first appealed for deferment of proceedings taking Hasina's medical condition into consideration. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case with Tejgaon police on Sept 2, 2007, naming eight people including Hasina. The antigraft body accused Hasina and the others of being variously involved in the exchange of Tk 3 crore in bribes from Wartsila Power Development Limited Consortium's local representative, and Summit Group and United Group representatives, for awarding contracts to set up three barge-mounted power plants in Khulna, Shikalbaha and Haripur. The ACC also accused Hasina of receiving a large part of the bribe money in the name of the Bangabandhu Memorial Trust during her term as prime minister. Others accused in the case are former power secretary Toufiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, former chairman of the Power Development Board Nooruddin Mahmud Kamal, Summit Group directors Md Aziz Khan and Farid Khan, United Group directors Hasan Mahmud Raja and Abul Kalam Azad, and curator of Bangabandhu Memorial Museum Syed Siddiqur Rahman. bdnews24.
