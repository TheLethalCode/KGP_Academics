 London, March 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nuclear power company British Energy Group Plc said on Monday that it was in talks which could lead to a business combination or an offer for the company. "The board announces that the company is in discussions with interested parties in the context of its future and its plans to take a pivotal role in any new nuclear programme," British Energy said in a statement. Shares in British Energy closed at 571.5 pence on Friday, valuing the company around 5.9 billion pounds ($11.6 billion). On Saturday, the Financial Times reported that the UK government had approached energy suppliers to see if they were interested in its 35.2 percent stake in British Energy. The newspaper quoted people close to the situation as saying Germany's E.ON AG and RWE, France's EDF, Iberdrola of Spain and Britain's Centrica were approached to see if they were interested in acquiring part of the stake, worth at least 2 billion pounds. "The government is keeping its stake in British Energy under review," a spokesman for the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform had said in a statement on Saturday. The spokesman said UBS had been appointed to advise the government on commercial and financial aspects of the interest in nuclear new build in Britain. "This may include advice on any proposals coming forward from British Energy following the company's call for new build partners, but UBS is not touting the government's stake on the market as is suggested," the spokesman had added.
