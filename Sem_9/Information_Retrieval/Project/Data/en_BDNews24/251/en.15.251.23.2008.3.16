 CAIRO, March 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Egypt's main stock indexes dipped on Sunday as falling global depositary receipts in London weighed on heavweight Orascom Telecom, but investors strongly bought steel stocks, brokers said. Shares in Orascom Teleocm, the fourth biggest Arab mobile operator by market value, lost 3.4 percent to 76.27 Egyptian pounds ($13.97) after its London GDR shares fell 2.8 percent on Friday. "OT is cheap and has a very good price-to-earning ratio, but people were only paying attention to what happened in London," said Eissa Fathy Eissa, managing director of the Strategic Company for Securities. Investor confidence took a fresh blow on Friday as an emergency funding plan to rescue Wall Street's fifth biggest broker Bear Stearns hammered global equity markets and boosted safe-haven flows to government bonds and inflation hedges like gold. Housing and real estate stocks were also in the red as Medinet Nasr Housing extended losses to a second session shedding 2 percent to last trade at 70.27 pounds. Helopolis Housing also fell 1 percent to 571 pounds, while the Sixth of October Development and Investment lost 1.5 percent to last trade at 240.01 pounds. Shares in Orascom Construction Industries (OCI), the most heavily traded stock by turnover, dipped 0.3 percent to 665 pounds. Overall, the CASE 30 index shed 1.2 percent to end at 11,198.48 points, while the well-watched Hermes index lost 1.1 percent to 98,355.21 points. The broader CIBC index fell 1 percent to 542.64 points. But Ezz Dekheila bucked the market trend to last trade 13.5 percent higher at 1,503.50 pounds after the company said it made 2.3 billion pounds in net profit in 2007, 14.3 percent up on the previous year. "With the continuous rises in local steel prices, people are re-evaluating the stock as they expect more profits for the company," Eissa said. Ezz Steel also rose, gaining 3.8 percent to 87.75 pounds. ($1 = 5.46 Egyptian poun
