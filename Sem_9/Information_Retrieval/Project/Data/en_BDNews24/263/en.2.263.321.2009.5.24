 Dhaka, May 24 (bdnews24.com)RAB killed an alleged robber in a 'shootout' when he 'attempted' to rob a CNG refuelling station early on Sunday at suburban Aminbazaar. 25-year-old Rafiqul Islam Azad also known as Swapan, faced two murder cases for allegedly killing police sub-inspector Motiur and two RAB members. RAB personnel recovered a loaded foreign pistol and sharp weapons from the spot. Menhazul Alam, assistant director, operations, RAB-4, said they had received prior information that the notorious 'Gangchil Gang' of Savar would raid the CNG pump station. The gangsters swooped on the earmarked NR Filling Station at 2:30am. As soon as the RAB-4 men arrived there, the robbers began fleeing the scene and RAB chased them. The miscreants fired at RAB men and they retaliated. As the five-minute gun-battle ceased, RAB took the bullet-hit Swapan to Savar Health Complex, where the doctors declared him dead. Five people have so far died in May in Dhaka and its suburbs in 'shootouts' with the elite anticrime force. bd
