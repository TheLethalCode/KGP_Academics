 Dhaka, May 24 (bdnews24.com)The government on Sunday served a third notice on BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia to leave her Dhaka Cantonment house by June 30. The notice, sent by the military lands administrator, asked her to hand the mansion over to military lands and cantonments directorate by that time. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam said Khaleda was served with a notice on May 7 and told to reply by 15 days why she should not leave the house. She did not respond by the deadline that ended on May 22. So, Alam said, she has been asked in the latest notice to leave the 6 Shaheed Moinul Road residence, Alam said. The High Court on May 18 ordered the government not to force opposition her out of the house until May 25. The court deferred to May 25 the hearing on the writ and supplementary petitions filed by Khaleda against an executive order. Military lands and cantonments directorate served Khaleda the notice on April 20 asking her to vacate her cantonment house. Challenging the legality of the Apr 20 notice, the former prime minister filed a writ petition on May 3. In a modified notice on May 7, it asked the opposition BNP chief to leave the house within 15 days. The cabinet on April 8 cancelled the lease on the house on grounds that the leasing process had been faulty and that she violated lease terms. Khaleda responded to the government's first notice with a legal notice of her own on Apr 23. After murder of her husband, army chief-turned-president Zia, on May 30, 1981 during a military mutiny, his widow, Khaleda, was given another house in Gulshan in addition to the house in the cantonment the family had been living since the 1970s. The 2.72-acre mansion was originally the official home of the army chief, a position held by then Lt Gen Zia who then converted himself into a civilian head of state through martial law proclamations and controversial votes. Before the cabinet took the decision to cancel the lease, prime minister Sheikh Hasina said in parliament that she would ask the slain general's wife to vacate the house and that blocks of apartments would be built in the prime land for families of army officers killed in the Feb mutiny. bd
