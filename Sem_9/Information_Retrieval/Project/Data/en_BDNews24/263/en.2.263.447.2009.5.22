 WASHINGTON, Fri May 22, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Obama administration has no plans to push General Motors Corp into bankruptcy next week and the outcome of the automaker's restructuring efforts may not be known until a June 1 deadline, a source familiar with the situation said early on Friday. Earlier, the Washington Post, citing sources familiar with the discussions, reported that the Treasury Department would steer GM into bankruptcy next week under a plan that would provide the company just short of $30 billion in new federal loans, A U.S. Treasury spokeswoman declined to comment.

If General Motors files for bankruptcy, as widely expected, its healthy assets will be quickly sold to a new company owned by the US government, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters on Tuesday. The source, who was not cleared to speak with the media and asked not to be identified, said the US government would pay for the assets by assuming the automaker's $6 billion of secured debt and forgiving the bulk of the $15.4 billion of emergency loans that the US Treasury has provided to GM.
