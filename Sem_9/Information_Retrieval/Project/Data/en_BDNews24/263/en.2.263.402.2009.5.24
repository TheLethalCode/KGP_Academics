 Dhaka, May 24 (bdnews24.com)The government will make a new law to stop extortion and terrorism over cellphone, the home minister said on Sunday. "Extortionists-terrorists have chosen mobile phones as a tool for their work," Sahara Khatun told reporters after a meeting with the delegation of mobile phone operators and officials of different organisations at the ministry. She said the government was taking strong measures to stop the menace. A high-level team headed by chairman of Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission BTRC Zia Ahmed has been formed, she added. The committee will recommend ways in 15 days to stop cellphone violence, and measures will be taken accordingly, Sahara said. State minister for home Tanjim Ahmed, home secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikder, BTRC chief Zia Ahmed, representatives of police, RAB, DGFI, NSI and mobile-phone operators were present in the meeting. Tanjim said the government with the help of Interpol would take initiatives to track extortionists-terrorists who are calling from abroad and threatening people in Bangladesh. "We are keeping contact with the Interpol to track these extortionists, terrorists. Initiatives will be taken through the foreign ministry to bring them back. Their list will be forwarded to Interpol, if needed." Earlier in the day, Sahara and Tanjim met with prime minister Sheikh Hasina and discussed overall law and order, and the report submitted by the national committee on the Feb 25-26 BDR mutiny. bdnews
