 Seoul, May 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - North Korea, condemned by the UN Security Council for its nuclear test the previous day, looked set to further ratchet up tension with a report on Tuesday that it would launch more short-range missiles. The nuclear test, which North Korea said was a success and made advances in explosive power, drew a sharp rebuke from regional powers. U.S. President Barack Obama said the North's nuclear arms programme was a threat to international security. In response, North Korea said Obama's administration remained hostile and that it was prepared for any attack by the United States. "Our army and people are fully ready for battle ... against any reckless U.S. attempt for a pre-emptive attack," the North's KCNA news agency said. In an unanimous statement adopted just hours after Monday's nuclear blast, the Security Council decided to start work immediately on a new resolution, condemning Monday's test as a "clear violation" of a previous resolution banning such tests in 2006. "The members of the Security Council have decided to start work immediately on a Security Council resolution on this matter," said the nonbinding statement read after a closed-door meeting by Russian U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin. The North fired off three short-range missiles from its east coast missiles bases on Monday. The Yonhap news agency quoted an unnamed South Korean official as saying it was likely to launch more, this time from its west coast, either on Tuesday of Wednesday. "North Korea declared a ban for ships in the sea off its South Pyongan province between the 25th to 27th (of May). It looks like it will fire a short-range missile between today and tomorrow," it quoted the official as saying. In Seoul, financial markets recovered from an initial shock by the close of trade on Monday but still looked nervous. Top financial officials were due on Tuesday to hold emergency talks on the possible impact for the economy and financial markets. The nuclear test drew outrage in the South, which was mourning the death of former President Roh Moo-hyun. SCALE OF BLAST DEBATED Analysts said the North opted for a nuclear test sooner than expected to draw the attention of the Obama administration and to raise the stakes for potential direct negotiations. It also sought to strengthen the power base of leader Kim Jong-il to lay the ground for succession, they said. Russia said the blast was about equal in power to the U.S. atomic bomb dropped on the Japanese city of Nagasaki in World War Two. That bomb had an explosion of about 20 kilotons. Other estimates said the North's nuclear device had a lower yield. One kiloton equals 1,000 tonnes and indicates the explosive yield of about that much weight of TNT. "When you have an artificial earthquake of 4.4 on the Richter scale, it's definitely more than 1 kiloton and it could be up to 20 kilotons (in explosive yield)," South Korea's Defence Minister Lee Sang-hee was quoted as telling parliament late on Monday. North Korea was under a Security Council resolution that banned activities related to nuclear and ballistic missile tests and subject to sanctions imposed under that 2006 resolution. "North Korea can only be hawkish this time, because time's running out for Kim Jong-il," said Jang Cheol-hyeon, an expert at the Institute for National Security Strategy in Seoul and a former official at the Workers Party of North Korea. Kim wants to seal a deal with the United States quickly and seek a swift and sharp improvement in the country's economy before he can publicly anoint one of his sons to succeed him, Jang said. "The recent military moves are yet another signal of trying to invite the U.S. to negotiations," he said.
