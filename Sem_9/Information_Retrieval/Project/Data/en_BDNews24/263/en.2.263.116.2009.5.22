 Dhaka, May 22 (bdnews24.com)The taskforce for interrogation cell (TFI) in Dhaka has started grilling former chief of National Security Intelligence retired brigadier general Abdur Rahim in the much-talked-about 10 trucks arms haul in Chittagong. The investigation officer of the case, CID Senior ASP Muniruzzaman Chowdhury, on Friday did not clarify further on Rahim's interrogation. Rahim was brought to Dhaka on Thursday afternoon for interrogation. Rahim and another former chief of the NSI retired major general Rezzaqul Haider Chowdhury were arrested at their houses in the capital on last Friday and the next day there were sent to the CID office in Chittagong. Rezzaqul would also be placed before the TFI cell, Muniruzzaman said. Earlier, they faced joint interrogation during three-day remand but this time they would be interrogated separately for the motive of the case, he said. Rahim was serving as the chief of NSI while Rezzaqul Haidar as the director of Counter Intelligence Bureau of DGFI during the arms haul. Rahim, then a retired officer, was appointed to the top NSI job by the BNP-led coalition government. Gen Chowdhury succeeded him later and was removed immediately after the army intervened to impose emergency on Jan 11, 2007. Chowdhury was also sent into retirement from the army. Another accused in the case, NSI director, security, retired wing commander Shahabuddin Ahmad, in his confessional statement in the court on Friday that Rezzaqul and Rahim were involved in the smuggling and transportation of arms. On the midnight of Apr 1, 2004, police seized a huge cache of deadly arms and ammunition hauled at the restricted jetty of Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Ltd. bdn
