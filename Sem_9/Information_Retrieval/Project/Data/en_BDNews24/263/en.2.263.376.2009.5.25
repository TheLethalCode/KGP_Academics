 Beijing, May 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese health authorities confirmed two new cases of H1N1 swine flu infection on Sunday, bringing the total confirmed infections on the mainland to nine, the Xinhua news agency reported late that day. The patients confirmed sick with the new virus strain were a 46-year-old Chinese man in a Beijing hospital and a two-year-old Chinese girl in the eastern coastal province of Fujian, the Health Ministry said, according to Xinhua. Both patients had recently returned from north America -- the man from Canada and the girl from the United States via Hong Kong, the report said. The man had been visiting relatives in Toronto. After returning on May 21, he went to a Beijing hospital with a sore throat and a cough. The report said the child was in stable condition. China has been checking people arriving from regions with outbreaks of H1N1 for signs of the flu, and authorities have put passengers they fear may have been exposed to the virus into enforced quarantine.
