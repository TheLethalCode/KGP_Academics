 Dhaka, May 24 (bdnews24.com)Steps to fully implement the budgetary measures in education and health would be the key towards a gender-sensitive budget, according to speakers at a pre-budget discussion on Sunday. "It should be the focal point since the betterment of health and education is directly linked to uplift of women," said Mustafizur Rahman, executive director of private research firm Centre for Policy Dialogue. Bangladesh Mohila Parishad organised the discussion on 'A Gender Sensitive Budget for Equal Rights for Women.' The CPD official also stressed on implementing the Millennium Development Goals as they include key indicators for women development. The government's programmes to provide support to the hard-core poor regions should be targeted towards the women in the area, he added. Touching on some mid-term initiatives, Musatfizur said the government should roll out plans to heavily invest in skills developing programmes for women. He said a market for skilled women in medical services would be there in the developed nations in next ten years and emphasised measures to pour in money to grab the opportunity. The Parishad recommended an allocation of at least Tk 100 crore in various sectors for women entrepreneurs in the next budget. Women rights activist Salma Khan, however, differed. Those entrepreneurs who are mostly from the Women Chambers of Commerce usually get support from their families. "All of the chamber leaders are spouses of prominent business people." She suggested the allocation for women instead go to the entrepreneurs of small and cottage industries. Speakers at the session agreed that a lack of accommodation facilities is hindering women to join the workforce and the next budget should set aside funds to build hostels for women across the country. "Most of the female students and working women in the district towns face this problem severely," said former caretaker government adviser Rasheda K Chowdhury. She focused on strong inter-ministerial coordination to address the key issues for gender development. Maleka Banu, general secretary of Parishad, underlined the need for strong monitoring on implement besides allocations. The session also heard from former caretaker government adviser Sultana Kamal, playwright Atiqul Haque Chowdhury and women activist Shirin Akhter.
