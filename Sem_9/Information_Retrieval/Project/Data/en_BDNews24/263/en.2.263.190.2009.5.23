<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov May (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh A suffered a four-wicket defeat to visiting Maharashtra Cricket Association in the second one-day match at the Bir Shreshtha Shaheed Motiur Rahman Stadium in Khulna on Saturday. Ameye Srikhande and Kedar Jadhav each struck half-centuries to propel the Maharashtra to 220-6 in 43.4 overs after the hosts managed 215 all out in 48.5 overs. The tourists began cautiously making just 37 runs in 9.5 overs before Ziaur Rahman removed Harshad Khadiwale for 24. Sharifullah dismissed opener Rahit Motwani for 29, leaving Maharashtra at 70-2 in 16.5 overs, but Ameya and Kedar defied the hosts attack to put on 93 runs for the third wicket. Sharifullah broke the stand having Kedar caught by Ziaur for stroke-filled 59 off 49 balls that was studded with four fours and three sixes and with his next delivery trapped new batsman Digambor Wagmare for a first-ball duck, leaving the visitors at 163-4 in 32.5 overs. However, Ameye with Ankit Bawne almost took the side home before Ameye was caught by Arafat off Suhrawardi Shuvo for a timely 75 off 93 balls featuring eight boundaries. Shuvo also removed another batsman in the same over to reduce Maharashtra to 211-6 in 41.1 overs, but could not avert the hosts from a defeat with Ankit with Srikant Munde remaining unbeaten on 20 and one. Earlier, opting to bat, Bangladesh's second string side slumped to 117-5 by 30 overs after opener Nazmus Sadat fell to Samad Fattah off the third delivery of the innings. However, captain Mehrab Hossain and Sharifullah contributed 43 and 65 respectively to help the hosts go beyond the 200-run mark. bd
