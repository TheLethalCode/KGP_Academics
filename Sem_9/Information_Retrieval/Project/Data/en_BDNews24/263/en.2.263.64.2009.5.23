<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, May 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's new coalition government said on Saturday it was up to Pakistan to take the first step towards better ties by cracking down on militants on its soil. "They should take determined and credible action to dismantle the infrastructure of terrorism operating from their territory that has been the stumbling block," new Foreign Minister Somanahalli Mallaiah Krishna told reporters soon after he was named to the post. India has ruled out talks with Pakistan unless it moves against militants New Delhi said carried out attacks on Mumbai last November, in which at least 166 people were killed. Pakistan says it has detained some suspects and sought more evidence from New Delhi for any further action. Krishna, 77, a former chief minister of Karnataka and governor of Maharashtra, said he would like India to be able to make peace with Pakistan. "Generally we would like to live in peace with our neighbours. This has been our desire and we are pursuing it," Krishna said. "We stand ready to extend our hand of friendship and partnership to Pakistan." Analysts say that with a stronger mandate behind it and a weakened Hindu nationalist opposition, the new Congress-led coalition has a freer hand to manage ties with Pakistan. While no major peace moves are considered likely, New Delhi could make small symbolic moves such as lifting of a travel advisory against visiting Pakistan imposed in December.
