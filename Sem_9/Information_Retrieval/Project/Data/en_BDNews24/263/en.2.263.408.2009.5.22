<TEXT>
 PARIS, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news from Ligue 1 before this weekend's matches: Playing at home against AS Monaco should help Girondins Bordeaux clinch their first title since 1999 on Saturday as they are unbeaten in the 32 games they have played at their Chaban-Delmas stadium since Oct. 7 2007. This season they have recorded 13 wins and five draws and won 44 points from their 18 home games, while second-placed Olympique Marseille have taken 32 and Olympique Lyon 35. The Aquitaine side will be crowned champions if they win and Marseille lose or draw at Nancy. If Bordeaux get a draw, a Marseille defeat would hand them the title. Olympique Marseille coach Eric Gerets believes his team "still have a one-in-a-thousand chance" of clinching the Ligue 1 title. "We have to be realistic, our 3-1 defeat to Olympique Lyon last weekend had dented our chances but we are still in a position to fight for the title," he added. Marseille are three points adrift of leaders Girondins Bordeaux with two games to play. They travel to Nancy on Saturday and will host Stade Rennes on May 30, while Bordeaux will play at home against Monaco and travel to Caen in their last two matches. Nancy chairman Jacques Rousselot has promised a warm welcome for Olympique Marseille on Saturday. "I have not forgotten that we were relegated in 2000 because Marseille had a better goal difference and they pipped us for third place and the preliminary round of the Champions League last season in the last game of the season," he told a press conference. Monaco's international midfielder Camel Meriem has announced he will leave the club at the end of the season. "I'm going to quit. The games gainst Girondins Bordeaux and Prti St Germain will be my last two with Monaco," the 29-year-old said in a statement posted on the club's website (www.asm-fc.com) on Friday. "I'm talking to several clubs. I'll go to Spain or Germany." Olympique Lyon supporters are bracing to bid farewell to midfielder Juninho, who will probably play his last game with the club against Caen at their Gerland Stadium on Saturday as he will be suspended for the last game of the season a week later. The 34-year-old Brazilian joined Lyon in 2001. Along with French international striker Sidney Govou, he is the only player to have played a part in all seven consecutive Ligue 1 titles. With two games remaining, the outgoing champions are third in the standings seven points adrift of leaders Girondins Bordeaux and four behind Olympique Marseille
