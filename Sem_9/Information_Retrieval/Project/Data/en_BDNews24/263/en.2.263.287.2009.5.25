 BUENOS AIRES, May 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Velez Sarsfield completed a miserable week for Boca Juniors by handing them a 2-0 defeat in the Argentine championship on Sunday. Velez scored twice in as many minutes against a Boca team still reeling from their shock Libertadores Cup elimination at home to Uruguayan outsiders Defensor Sporting on Thursday.

River Plate and Independiente, two more of Argentina's big five, went into their derby at the Monumental stadium after both suffering four-goal defeats last week. River redeemed themselves with a 2-0 win as both teams missed a penalty. Diego Barrado put River ahead with a superb goal in the 29th minute, running from midfield before firing a 25-metre shot past Fabio Assman. Barrado also set up the second nine minutes later, providing the cross for Radamel Falcao Garcia to head the second. Garcia missed a penalty in the 59th minute, firing over the bar, and Independiente's Daniel Montenegro had another penalty stopped by River goalkeeper Daniel Verga two minutes la
