<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 23 (bdnews24.com) The food minister on Saturday said that the government would introduce a new system so that farmers could sell paddy at the price set by the government. The farmers are counting losses as paddy sells at Tk 380-420 per mound against government-fixed price of Tk 560 in the northern districts including Naogaon. Under the system, the mill owners would be obliged to purchase certain amount of paddy directly from the farmers, Abdur Razzaq said on Friday. He vented his dissatisfaction over the overall situation of rice-paddy market during his visit to Hapania Hat of Naogaon Sadar Upazila on Friday. The minister visited the northern districts including Bogra , Dinajpur, Rangpur and Naogaon to monitor the current Boro procurement campaign and spoke to the farmers. Razzaq directed the food officials to purchase paddy in huge quantity from the farmers. He said the incumbent government was trying to ensure that the farmers are not affected. Earlier, the minister exchanged views with the mill owners at Naogaon Circuit House where the mill owners demanded that more rice were procured from the region and construction of more granaries. Razzaq said the granaries could store only 12 lakh metric tons of rice, which was why the government was unable to procure huge amount of rice and paddy despite bumper production. He said the government would construct food storage with capacity of 101,000 tonnes in the northern region apart from one at Naraynganj and two at Mongla port. b
