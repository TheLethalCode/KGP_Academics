<TEXT>
 Centurion, May 22 (bdnews24.com) A blistering 85 from skipper Adam Gilchrist propelled last edition's bottom-ranked Deccan Chargers into the final of the Indian Premier League following their six-wicket win over table-toppers Delhi Daredevils in the first semi-final on Friday. 'Man of the Match' Gilchrist hammered 10 fours and five sixes in his 35-ball knock that single-handedly turned the semi-final into a no contest after Delhi, invited to bat, rode on Tillakaratne Dilshan's half-century to post a fighting 153 for eight. The Australian wicketkeeper seemed to be in a hurry to finish off the match. He was in a murderous mood, hitting Dirk Nannes for five consecutive boundaries in the very first over and then welcoming Pradeep Sangwan with back to back fours and a huge six over mid-wicket. Herschelle Gibbs' (0) dismissal had very little effect on him as he brought his 50 off just 17 deliveries, the fastest in the IPL so far, and fifth quickest in Twenty20 cricket. His innings was finally brought to an end by Amit Mishra after Gilchrist attempted another big one but held out to Nannes at short third-man. And if Delhi thought getting rid of Gilchrist was the end of all their troubles, they were in for shock as Andrew Symonds (24 off 15 balls) walked in and clobbered Nannes for two successive boundaries. Tirumalsetti Suman (unbeaten 24) too joined in the party and picked up a couple of fours and by the time Symonds fell to Mishra (3/19), Deccan Chargers were well into the final, which they did with 14 balls to spare. Earlier, Tillakaratne Dilshan's breezy half-century helped Delhi Daredevils recover from a nightmare start and post 153 for eight against Deccan Chargers in the first semi-final. Sri Lankan Dilshan survived two dropped catches and a run out attempt to score 65 off 51 balls and alongwith captain Virender Sehwag (39) and AB de Villiers (26), helped Delhi reach a competitive total. Dilshan, who started off with a pulled six off RP Singh, and Sehwag produced a counter-punch that saw Delhi recover from two down without opening their account. Adam Gilchrist's decision to put Delhi Daredevils to bat after winning the toss seemed vindicated when they suffered a twin blow in the very first over, Ryan Harris removing openers Gautam Gambhir and David Warner in quick succession. Gambhir tried to hoist the Australian over the top but only found RP Singh at third man without opening his and Delhi's account. Warner slashed the next ball to Herschelle Gibbs at point and Delhi were in trouble with two down without any runs on the board. It brought Sehwag and Dilshan together. The duo was in ominous form as they drove, cut and pulled with effortless ease and at the half-way stage, Delhi had raced to 83. However, the first over after the break accounted for Sehwag. Andrew Symonds trapped the Delhi skipper in front of the wicket for 39. His 31-ball knock included five hits to the fence. Sehwag's departure put the breaks on Delhi before Dilshan, accompanied by AB de Villiers, got the team back on track. The Sri Lankan brought his 50 off 35 balls with a four and De Villiers then hit two sixes to push the run rate. The South African fell for 26 (off 21 balls) and Dinesh Karthik (9) went soon after. Towards the end, wickets fell in a heap and Dilshan, who hit seven fours and a six, too perished, going for a non-existent second run in the last over. And with Gilchirst at his ominous best, no score was safe and Delhi found that out on Friday much to their dis
