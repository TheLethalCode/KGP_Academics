 Rajshahi, May 23 (bdnews24.com)At least six, including two police men, sustained injuries in a clash between police and pro-Jamaat-e-Islami Islami Chhatra Shibir at Rajshahi University on Saturday. The clash broke out as police stopped them bringing out a procession on the campus violating a ban on all processions and meetings. The Shibir men pelted them with stones and in retaliation police fired tear gas and charged baton on them. Traffic on Dhaka-Rajshahi Highway came to a halt as the procession moved along when the police intercepted them. Proctor Chowdhury Mohammad Zakaria told bdnews24.com that Shibir sought permission to take out the procession on the campus. But authorities refused them fearing deterioration of law and order and told them that if they did police would take steps, he also said. Rajshahi Metropolitan Police urged Shibir activists not to demonstrate on the campus as the university was scheduled to reopen on June 1, Jahangir Hossain, assistant commissioner of Boalia Zone, said. They also threw stones at the university police camp, he added. bdn
