<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 24 (bdnews24.com)The High Court on Sunday ordered the government to take effective measures against erection of any installationtemporary or permanenton the banks of the Buriganga, Shitalakhya, Balu and Turag rivers. The court also prohibited encroachment and land filling of all sorts on these rivers skirting capital Dhaka. The bench of justices ABM Khairul Haque and Mohammed Mamtazuddin gave the order after hearing the public interest writ petition filed by Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh, a human-rights and environmental organisation. The court asked the government to explain why an order to restore the rivers in question to their former state and to remove the installations on their shores should not be served. The court further wanted to know why the government should not be ordered to define the natural boundaries and limits of the rivers. The secretaries to the planning, finance, shipping, land, local government, water resources and communication ministries, BIWTA chairman, land and environment directors-general and Dhaka, Narayanganj and Gazipur deputy commissioners have been asked to respond to the ruling in a week. These agencies also were told to take steps to stop raising any structure on the river-banks. Advocate Manjil Morshed conducted the hearing of the petition. bdne
