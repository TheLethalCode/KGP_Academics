 BORDEAUX, May 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Girondins Bordeaux moved closer to the Ligue 1 title on Saturday when a 1-0 win at home to Monaco kept them three points clear of Olympique Marseille with just one game left to play. Bordeaux, who were last crowned champions 10 years ago, are on 77 points after extending their winning streak to 10 league games. They will visit strugglers Caen next Saturday. Marseille, second on 74 points, secured automatic entry to the Champions League with a 2-1 win at Nancy before they host Stade Rennes for their last game. "We would have liked Nancy to hold Marseille but at least we won," Bordeaux playmaker Yoann Gourcuff told Canal Plus television.

"We should have won 6-0," Marseille coach Eric Gerets told reporters. "Bordeaux still have the best chances to win the title," he added. Juninho scored his 100th goal for Lyon when he converted from the spot after being brought down in the area. The Brazilian midfielder was then given a standing ovation from Lyon's fans when he was substituted after the interval. Ligue 1 top scorer Andre-Pierre Gignac scored two to take his tally to 24 goals as he helped Toulouse move up to fourth with a 2-0 win over Nice. Second-bottom Nantes lost 2-1 at fellow strugglers Sochaux and are on the brink of relegation to Ligu
