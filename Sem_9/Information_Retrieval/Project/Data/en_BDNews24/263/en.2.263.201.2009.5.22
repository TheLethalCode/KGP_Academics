 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, May 22 (bdnews24.coom)Foreign minister Dipu Moni has instructed Bangladeshi diplomats abroad not to attend any "political" events hosted by any group, ruling or opposition. The minister's directive came after a meeting with her senior civil servants, who sat recently to discuss a letter from an ambassador seeking her permission to attend a political programme organised by local Awami League unit in a European country. She instructed the foreign secretary to notify this to all officials serving in 46 Bangladesh missions or consulate offices. "We've already communicated the minister's directive to all missions," foreign secretary Md Touhid Hossain told bdnews24.com on Thursday at his office. "Why should the officials go to the political programmes. They must not," he said. "But they can attend social events hosted by the Bangladeshi community." Foreign ministry sources say a Bangladeshi ambassador serving in a European country sought the minister's permission about two months ago to attend an event of the local unit of Awami League. The Awami League supporters based in that country mounted pressure on the ambassador when he rejected the invitation, forcing him to turn to the foreign minister herself. The foreign secretary said the diplomats serving in foreign missions have long been facing such pressure. One former diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, gave details of the kind of pressure the so-called overseas units of major parties put on the public servants posted in foreign countries. "Very often such activists engage themselves in scuffles over leadership, control of the event, who speaks or who doesn't," the diplomat said. "And all this happens in presence of the ambassador." "It is indeed difficult to say 'no' to these people. They will straight call the ministers or top ruling party figures to complain (against those refusing)," the diplomat said. "Sometimes, they would come to invite us with some minister or a top ruling party man on the other side of their mobile phone. "If we would say 'no', the ministers would hear it and take action against the officials. "How many officials have the courage to refuse to attend an event on Ziaur Rahman's birth anniversary hosted by the overseas activists when BNP is in power," the former diplomat told bdnews24.c
