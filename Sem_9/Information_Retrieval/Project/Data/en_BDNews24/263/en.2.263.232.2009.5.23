<TITLE> FACTBOX: Key ministers in Manmohan Singh's cabinet </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 New Delhi, May 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was sworn in on Friday for a second five-year term with a host of old-guard ministers at a time of economic downturn and fraught ties with Pakistan. Nineteen members of his cabinet, including Congress stalwart Pranab Mukherjee, who is tipped to be the new finance minister, were sworn in. Portfolios of the ministers have not been allocated. The following are profiles of the main cabinet members. PRANAB MUKHERJEE: Mukherjee, 73 is a veteran Congress leader and has held several key posts in earlier governments. He was the foreign minister and acting finance minister in the previous Manmohan Singh-led government, and is seen as a safe pair of hands. Congress party sources say he may be finance minister again. A sign of his priorities was seen in February when Mukherjee said spending may have to jump later this year to shield the economy from a global slump and stem job losses. KAMAL NATH: Kamal Nath, 62, has played a key role as a negotiator for emerging nations in the struggling Doha round of global trade talks. He is likely to stay on as commerce and industry minister. Nath is seen as one of the key reformers in the Congress. Under his tenure as commerce and industry minister in the previous government foreign direct investment touched around $27 billion in 2008/09, in part helped by his efforts in attracting top global firms to India. PALANIAPPAN CHIDAMBARAM : Palaniappan Chidambaram, 63, is seen as having successfully revamped India's security apparatus as home minister after last November's Mumbai attacks. Many think he will stay on in this post. Chidambaram was also finance minister for four years in the last government, lauded for his reformist stance. His tenure as finance minister saw growth averaging about 9 percent. SHARAD PAWAR: Pawar, 68, who held the farm ministry portfolio in the last government, heads a major party allied to Congress in the western state of Maharashtra, home to financial hub Mumbai. He is seen as one of India's most powerful politicians, close to the business world. Known as the "Maratha strongman" for the large sway he holds in his home state, Pawar had been tipped as a potential compromise candidate for prime minister if the polls had resulted in a hung parliament. ARACKAPARAMBIL KURIAN ANTONY: A three-time chief minister from the southern state of Kerala, he is popular among Congress supporters for his clean politics. Antony, 68, was the defence minister in the last Congress-led coalition government, and is tipped to continue in the same post. If he was defence minister again, he would face the challenge of overcoming delays in modernising India's largely Soviet-era weapons system and opening up arms deals to Western nations like the United States. MAMATA BANERJEE: The job of railway minister will likely go to Mamata Banerjee, the maverick chief of the regional Trinamool Congress which routed the communists in their stronghold eastern state of of West Bengal. Banerjee, 54, swept to power after successfully opposing seizure of farmland for industry, a campaign that forced Tata Motors to abandon plans to produce its Nano car in West Bengal. Banerjee, who was the railways minister in early 2000, faces a huge challenge in keeping the railways in profit and upgrading security systems to avoid accidents.
