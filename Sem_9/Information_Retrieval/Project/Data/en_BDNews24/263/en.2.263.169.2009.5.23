 MILAN, May 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Inter Milan coach Jose Mourinho hinted on Saturday he needed to sign more players in order to commit 100 percent to the Italian champions. Mourinho, who has led Inter to the Serie A title in his first season in charge, alarmed fans on Thursday when he said he was 99.9 percent certain to stay amid reported interest from Real Madrid. "I want to transform this 99.9 percent into 100. Little things are needed," he told a news conference without specifying what he meant. However, Mourinho later went on to talk about new signings he feels Inter need to challenge in the Champions League next season. Genoa's Diego Milito and Thiago Motta are poised to join the champions with others likely to follow. "I'm happy at Inter. The club is working, we've practically signed two players," he said on Saturday. "In life nothing is certain but I said 99.9 percent not 99. Yes 99.9 is different from 100, there's a tiny bit of temptation. I'm not a person to hide things." Mourinho, who said he had turned down Real when he was Chelsea coach, had previously stated he would like to win a championship in Spain one day having won titles in England and Italy
