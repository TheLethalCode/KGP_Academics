<TITLE> Ronaldo deal would be 'madness', Real candidate says </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MADRID, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Buying Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United for a figure of up to 100 million euros would be 'madness', Real Madrid presidential candidate Juan Onieva said on Friday. The former vice-president, who has said he will stand in next month's election for the Real presidency, told a radio interviewer that he was aware of a pre-agreement with the Portugal winger that was set up by former president Ramon Calderon. He said there was an obligation on both parties to come up with an indemnity payment if either changed their mind by June 30. "I wouldn't go through with it. If I had to take a decision I would contest the deal. I think it's madness," Onieva told Onda Cero. "I only know the terms in general; I haven't seen the document." The interviewer mentioned a figure of 100 million euros, to which Onieva replied: "I think it is a little less than this, because the deal was made in pounds. "In terms of the figures, as far as I am aware, it is not right to pay that amount of money especially in times like these. It's almost offensive. Also I don't think he is the solution for Real Madrid." Onieva, former president Florentino Perez and the little-known Eduardo Garcia have said they will stand in the election which is due to take place on June 14
