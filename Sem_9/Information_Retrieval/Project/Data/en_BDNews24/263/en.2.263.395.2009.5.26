 Canberra, May 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia's government on Tuesday ordered more than 2,000 passengers of a visiting cruise ship to isolate themselves after two child passengers were confirmed with H1N1, raising the country's total to 32. Thirteen people were taken to hospital in Queensland state with flu symptoms after travelling on the super liner Pacific Dawn, where two children tested positive to so-called "swine flu", Health Minister Nicola Roxon said. A 41-year-old Canberra man became the first recorded N1H1 case in the nation's capital after returning from the United States, while four others tested positive in Victoria state.
