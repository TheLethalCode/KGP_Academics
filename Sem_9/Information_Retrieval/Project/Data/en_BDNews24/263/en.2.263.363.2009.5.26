 Brahmanbaria, May 26 (bdnews24.com)Six of the eight units of Ashuganj thermo-electric power station have been shut down by the authorities on Tuesday morning due to cyclone Aila. The shutdown caused a 428 megawatt supply dearth in the national grid. "Electric wires and poles were damaged in different districts by cyclone Aila. Electricity cannot be supplied unless those are repaired," the managing director of the station, Abdul Khaleq, told bdnews24.com. "Besides, the demand for electricity went down because of rain." He said Unit 3 and Unit 5 are now producing 100 and 80 megawatts respectively instead of their usual 150 megawatt each. The units shut down are 56-MW GT 1, 56-MW GT 2, 34-MW MP Unit, 64-MW Unit 1, 64-MW Unit 2 and 150-MW Unit 4. bdnews
