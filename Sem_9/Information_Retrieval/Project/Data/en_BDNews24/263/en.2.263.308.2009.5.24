 Dhaka, May 24 (bdnews24.com)The government will soon launch a combing operation in Khulna and Barisal to improve security in the southwest, police have told a parliamentary watchdog. A high-ranking police official told the parliamentary standing committee on the home ministry that preparations were underway for the joint Police-RAB operation against criminals. "One of the (standing committee) members said the law and order has deteriorated in Khulna and Barisal region. "In reply, the police officials told us that the Police-RAB combing operation will start soon," Sanjida Khanam, a committee member, told bdnews24.com on Sunday after the meeting. The Awami League government in its previous 1996-2001 term carried out a combing operation and imprisoned many notorious criminals operating under the banner of armed 'communists'. The committee chairman Abdus Salam refused to give details of the operation but admitted that the police informed the meeting about the operation. He said the meeting mainly highlighted the activities of the fire service and civil defence under the home ministry. After the presentation on fire service, the parliament officials were asked to leave the meeting venue in parliament building. Abdus Salam said fire service and civil defence department could not check whether the owners of highrise buildings fitted the necessary fire equipment necessary to fight incidents of fire. "Therefore, we have asked the fire brigade and civil defence department to submit a proposal to the home ministry for introduction of fire certificate before a newly constructed highrise building is occupied," Salam said. Committee members home minister Shahara Khatun, state minister for home Tanjim Ahmed, whip Mirza Azam, Md Mujibul Haq, Md Habibor Rahman and Shafiqul Islam attended the meeting.
