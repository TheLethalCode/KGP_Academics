 Dhaka, May 22 (bdnews24.com)India has provisionally agreed a Bangladesh proposal to change the timing of Dhaka-Kolkata passenger train Maitree Express to woo more passengers, railway officials say. The new timetable would come into effect in two months, subject to a final approval, Bangladesh Railway's director general Md Belayet Hossain told bdnews24.com on Thursday. According to the draft proposal, the train will reach destinations in 11 hours instead of 13 hours, he said. The time for customs and immigration formalities will also be cut to three hours and 10 minutes from four and a half hours, he said. Additional director general Quazi Asadullah said Maitree Express will start from Dhaka Cantonment Station on Saturday at 7:35am and reach Kolkata at 18:15pm, all BdST, according to the new proposal. The same train will start for Dhaka on Sunday at 7:10am (IST) and reach the cantonment station at 18:45pm (BdST), he said. At present, the Maitree Express, the first and only direct passenger train between India and Bangladesh launched on April 14 last year, starts for Kolkata at 8:30am on Saturday and reaches in 13 hours. Similarly, one Eastern Railway train leaves Kolkata for Dhaka on Saturday at 7:10 am (IST) and takes 13 hours to reach the cantonment station. The train returns next day. According to the proposal, the Indian side will require two hours for customs and immigration formalities at the bordering station Gede. The proposal also gives Bangladesh one hour and 10 minutes to complete customs and immigration activities at bordering Darsana station. The Maitree Express cannot attract more passengers due to its four and a half hours stoppage--two hours in Dasana and two and a half hours in Gede--for finishing customs and immigration formalities. On average, 75 passengers travel by the train having 400-plus seats. At the May 12-14 Inter-governmental railway meeting in New Delhi, Dhaka proposed that the Bangladesh train should reach Kolkata on Saturday and return on Sunday. It also said the Indian train should run on Tuesday instead of Saturday and return on Wednesday. "The Indian side told us that they need to mobilise more manpower to change the schedules of the train," said Asadullah. The director general said, "If any passenger wants to stay in Kolkata for two days, he/she must wait for seven days to travel by train. "A change in the schedules will certainly give passengers the chance to travel and return by train". The railway distance between the two cities is 538 kilometres418 kilometres in Bangladesh and 120 kilometres in the Indian side.
