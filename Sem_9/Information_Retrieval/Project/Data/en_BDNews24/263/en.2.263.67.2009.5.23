 Dhaka, May 23 (bdnews24.com)The government will constitute a committee soon to see if the bribe money paid by German industrial giant Siemens was diverted to fund banned Islamist outfit Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh, the telecoms minister has said.. Raziuddin Ahmed Razu told reporters on Saturday that the committee would be formed in a week to investigate irregularities in the telecoms sector during the 2001-2006 BNP-led coalition government, the period Bangladesh was ranked the most corrupt country in the world by Transparency International. He spoke to reporters after attending a discussion marking World Telecommunication Day and award-giving ceremony organised by Bangladesh Mobile Phone Business Association at Sonargaon Hotel in Dhaka. The decision came after US-based television channel Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) ran a feature indicating that former telecoms minister Aminul Haque, who is allegedly involved in the Siemens corruption, had formed a deadly alliance with the JMB, which has been charged with a wave of abductions and killings in the northwest region. Siemens paid $5 million in bribes to government officials to land a telecom deal. Haque was sentenced to 31 years in prison in 2007 for aiding and abetting JMB.
