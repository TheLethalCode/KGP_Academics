 Chennai, May 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The DMK, a major ally of India's ruling Congress party said on Monday it had returned to the coalition after settling differences over ministerial posts, boosting the government's stability. The Tamil Nadu party refused to join the government last week and offered its 18 lawmakers as outside support to the coalition in parliament. DMK chief Karunanidhi said in a statement that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called him up on Monday and accepted a list of possible ministers from his party. "The new ministers will be sworn in on Tuesday", Karunanidhi said. Officials in the Congress coalition, which has a comfortable majority in parliament, confirmed Singh's council of ministers would be expanded on Tuesday and it would include DMK lawmakers. DMK party sources said its members could be allotted three cabinet posts and four junior minister posts.
