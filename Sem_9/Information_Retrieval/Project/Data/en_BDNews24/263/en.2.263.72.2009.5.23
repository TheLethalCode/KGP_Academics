 LONDON, May 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chelsea players Didier Drogba and Jose Bosingwa have been charged with misconduct by European soccer's governing body UEFA after ugly scenes at the end of their Champions League semi-final against Barcelona on May 6. UEFA has also brought disciplinary proceedings against the Premier League club for the improper conduct of their players and the throwing of missiles by their fans. Barcelona went through to the final against Manchester United next Wednesday on away goals after the match ended in a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge. Ivory Coast captain Drogba harangued Norwegian referee Tom Henning Ovrebo after the final whistle before directing a foul-mouthed tirade at a television camera while Bosingwa made disparaging remarks about Ovrebo in the media. Both players face charges of bad sportsmanship. "UEFA has today announced it has instigated disciplinary proceedings against Chelsea FC and two Chelsea players, Didier Drogba and Joseph Bosingwa, following the Champions League second leg semi-final match at Stamford Bridge. The statement added: "The disciplinary proceedings are based on the following charges: "Chelsea FC for being responsible for the improper conduct of players and the throwing of missiles by their supporters. "Didier Drogba and Joseph Bosingwa for being in breach of the principles of sportsmanship by insulting the referee by making offensive comments." Chelsea issued a statement later on Friday on its website (www.chelseafc.com) saying the club would respond to the charges in "due course" adding: "We would like to make clear again, as we did at the time, that the incidents in question were regrettable and occurred only because of the high emotions and frustrations which arose from the disappointment of a controversial defeat in such an important game. "We are all acutely aware of the responsibilities that lie with both the club and its players as regards setting a good example as role models and upholding the principles of fair play in football. Both of the players accept that and apologised honestly very soon afterwards for their actions." TURNED NASTY A tense semi-final, second leg, turned nasty when Barcelona's Andres Iniesta scored in the third minute of stoppage time to level an early goal by Michael Essien, sending Chelsea out of the competition on the away goals rule. Drogba, and other Chelsea players, were furious that several strong penalty claims had been turned down during the match. Bosingwa later described the referee as "a thief" when talking to Portuguese television. Both players later apologised for their reactions. Chelsea's Germany captain Michael Ballack has escaped any punishment despite charging after Ovrebo when another penalty appeal was waved away as they searched for a last-gasp winner. UEFA has asked Chelsea for statements from the club and the two players by May 29. UEFA's Control and Disciplinary Body will deal with the case on June
