Seven people died in Calcutta when huge trees uprooted by the cyclone fell on buses, cars and auto-rickshaws. Shanta Mitra was inconsoable because her son Abir Lal was crushed by a banyan tree that crashed on the auto rickshaw in which he was travelling. "He took me for a medical checkup at the Bangur hospital. Then we both took an auto back home and he was beside me when the tree fell on him. I saw him die in front of my eyes," said a wailing Shanta. The rest of the casualties were reported from Howrah, Hooghly , Nadia , Bankura, North 24 Parganas and East Midnapore district. "We have rescued more than 100,000 people and send them to safer places. We are now arranging dry food packets and drinking water pouches for them," Hossain said.
