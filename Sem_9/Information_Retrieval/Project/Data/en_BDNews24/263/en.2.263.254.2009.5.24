 Dhaka, May 24 (bdnews24.com)The cabinet purchase committee decided on Sunday to put the contract out to fresh tender for running inland container depots in Dhaka and Chittagong. The committee at a meeting decided the move because the price was 12 percent more than actual cost in the acceptable tender, said cabinet secretary Abdul Aziz, also a member of the committee. Only two companies, for each terminal, submitted bids and one of those has been approved. Besides, three of the seven proposals discussed, were approved in the meeting presided over by finance minister AMA Muhith. The meeting decided to renew the agreement with Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) in 2009-10 fiscal year. Bangladesh will import 17.45 lakh metric tonnes of fuel oil from Kuwait under the deal that had expired in December last year. The new deal that took retroactive effect from April ends in Dec next year. The committee also approved the appointment of the lowest bidder for renovation of bleaching plant at Khulna Paper Mill at a cost of Tk 93 crore. The proposal to import 25,000 metric tonnes urea fertiliser for Tk 51.51 crore in the next fiscal year was also approved. The committee cancelled two tenders for maintenance of 25 straddle carriers at Chittagong port.
