 Dhaka, May 24 (bdnews24.com)  In a bid to strengthen relations between Bangladesh and Bangladeshi Diaspora living in the United Kingdom, a six-member British Bangladeshi delegation visited Abahani Limited on Sunday to exchange views with club officials. Abahani director Kazi Nabil Ahmed uphold the history of Abahani Limited as well as the successes in different disciplines like football, cricket, hockey, table tennis, badminton etc since it was established in 1972, but the delegation's attention was on only football. Mesba Ahmed, head of the delegation, asked the Abahani director how to include the British Bangladeshi footballers in the Bangladesh national team as well as in the professional football league. Nabil said that as they were participating in the professional football league regularly, they could consider those British Bangladeshi footballers subject to qualification. Mesba, also chief executive of London Tigers  a semi professional football team in the UK, showed interest in the youth development and asked Abahani whether it had any plan with different age-level teams like Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool. Mentioning the lack of financial support, Nabil said they would form age-level teams if the delegation extended their helping hand towards them. "The main object of our visit is to bring the new generation British Bangladeshis closer to their counterparts in Bangladesh and provide a platform so that they can candidly exchange views, ideas and opinions," said Mesba, who has been working with many professional clubs, sporting governing bodies in the UK including The FA, Sports England and Middlesex Cricket Board.
