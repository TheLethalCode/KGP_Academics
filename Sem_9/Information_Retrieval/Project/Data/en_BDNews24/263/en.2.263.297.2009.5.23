 Kathmandu, May 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - One person was killed and at least a dozen wounded when an explosion ripped through a church near the Nepali capital on Saturday, police said, hours before the country's parliament was set to elect a new prime minister. The blast hit the Dhobighat suburb in Lalitpur, an adjoining town 4 km (3 miles) south of Kathmandu. "The wounded people have been rushed to a local hospital and we are investigating," superintendent of police Kedarman Singh Bhandari told Reuters, without giving further details. There were no claims of responsibility. Nepal will elect a new prime minister on Saturday, three weeks after Maoist leader Prachanda resigned amid a row over his plan to fire the country's army chief. Majority-Hindu Nepal has little history of religious conflict with minority Christians. But two people were killed in a similar blast on a mosque in east Nepal last year. That attack was claimed by a little-known group called the Nepal Defence Army. Nepal has just emerged from a decade-long civil war that ended in 2006, and the former Maoist rebels won a surprise victory in national election held in April last year.
