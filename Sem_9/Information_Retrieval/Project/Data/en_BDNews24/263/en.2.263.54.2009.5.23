 PARIS, May 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Last time Rafael Nadal was in Paris, he was booed by the crowd. Defending his French Open title, he hopes, will allow him to win back the city's affection. "Last year I had a little bit of a problem in Paris, in Bercy when I retired," the world number one told reporters on Friday. The Spaniard was jeered by the capacity crowd at last October's Paris Masters at the Bercy arena, when he limped off after retiring with an injury during his quarter-final against Russian Nikolay Davydenko, having lost the first set 6-1. "It was tougher maybe because it was painful for me to go off the court when I was injured," Nadal said. "It was really a tough moment, and the crowd, yeah, they booed me a little bit." Although the French Open crowd have always had a soft spot for his rival Roger Federer, Nadal, four-times champion at the grand-slam event, is happy with his own relationship with the fans at the Roland Garros complex. "Everybody is free to do what they want. I always, I think, was nice with the French crowd, and I think they were okay with me," he said ahead of this year's tournament, which starts on Sunday. Frenchwoman Amelie Mauresmo knows that her home fans can react differently in different venues. A darling of the fans at the Coubertin indoor arena, where she won the Paris Open this year, Mauresmo has always had a more difficult relationship with the Roland Garros crowd. "It was a dream then. I was asked what is the difference at the time and I said, 'When you come to Coubertin, I don't even need to convince them. They're there. They're supporting'," the former world number one, seeded 16th at the French Open, told reporters. "Every year it's the same, and it's fantastic. Of course, this gives me a lot of pleasure. Now it's going to be up to me to create the same relationship with the crowd here, because this doesn't happen naturally. "It is up to me to share my emotions with the crowd in order to have them be behind me," added Maure
