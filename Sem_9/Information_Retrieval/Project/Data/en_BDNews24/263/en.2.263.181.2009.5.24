 Dhaka, May 24 (bdnews24.com)The deep depression over west central Bay and adjoining east central Bay intensified into cyclonic storm "Aila" on Sunday, the Met office said in a bulletin. The depression moved slightly northwards to north Bay and adjoining west central bay and was centered at 6pm about 565 km southwest of Chittagong port, 510 km southwest of Cox's Bazar port and 460 km south-southwest of Mongla port. It is likely to intensify further and move in a northerly direction. Maximum sustained wind speed within 54 km of the storm centre is about 60 kph rising to 70 kph in gusts. Sea will remain rough. Chittagong, Cox's Bazar and Mongla ports have been advised to hoist local warning signal number four. All fishing boats and trawlers over north Bay have been advised to remain in shelter until further notice. Rain or thundershowers accompanied by temporary gusty to squally wind is likely to occur at many places over Barisal, Khulna and Chittagong divisions and at one or two places over Rajshahi, Dhaka and Sylhet divisions with moderately heavy rainfalls at places over Khulna, Barisal and Chittagong divisions. A mild heat wave over Rajshahi division may continue. Day temperature may fall slightly across the country. River traffic halted The Inclement weather has forced suspension of ferry movement from 8am on all rivers routes, said Patuakhali river port official Md Shahidul Mia. Fishermen are coming back from the sea because of high tide, said general secretary of fish traders committee Nimai Chandra from Kuakata. The rivers in the costal areas are flowing in high tide because of the depression in the bay, said Ahsan Azim from Charkajal. It has been raining sporadically in the coastal areas of Patuakhali from Saturday midnight. Barguna wary The people of the coastal southern district of Barguna, hit by cyclone Sidr in late 2007, are living in constant fear on the news that a depression in the Bay of Bengal has deepened and still intensifying. It has been raining sporadically from Saturday midnight and the sun has remained behind the clouds. Hundreds of fishing trawlers haves returned to Pathorghata, Noli and Taltoli from the Bay until Sunday afternoon, said president of Barguna District Trawler Owners' Association Golam Mostafa Chowdhury. "We will start calling people to shelter buildings through megaphones as soon as the level of the signal is increased," said the team leader of cyclone preparation activities and member of Borguna Red Crescent Unit Zakir Hossain Miraj. bdnews24
