 Dhaka, May 24 (bdnews24.com)Sepoy Md Abdus Samad of 44 Rifles Battalion, one of the 25 BDR men declared absconding by the government, has been in the prison, his family says. Azizul Huq, brother of Samad, told bdnews24.com that his brother was arrested from his room at Peelkhna on Feb 27 and sent to prison by the court. He showed jail slips as proof of their meeting. "I met him several times in the prison but the government is now saying that Samad is absconding." bdnews 24.com tried to reach BDR director-general major general Moinul Islam on Sunday evening. "He is in a meeting,'' an aide said. After the Peelkhana massacre by the renegade border guards, the government said 25 were absconding and sought cooperation of the people to arrest them. At the same time a list of fugitives were sent to police stations, airports and border outposts. Samad's name including his photo was the 19th on the list. "After his arrest I first met him on March 3. He was then sent to Kashimpur prison. I met him in that prison on March 11, April 3, April 26 and May 11," the brother said. According to three slips supplied to bdnews24.com by Huq, he met his brother in Kashimpur jail on Apr 26 under slip no 1831 and on May 11 under slip no 4773 He said he had collected slip on Sunday but could not meet his brother.

His number as accused in the court was 962 on that day. The same court sent him to Dhaka Central Jail on May 23. Over 1,000 BDR members were sued by Lalbagh police on Feb 25 and 26 on charge of sedition for the mutiny that left 57 army officers deputed to the paramilitary force killed. b
