 Dhaka, May 25 (bdnews24.com)The government has said as many as 42,000 volunteers along with army, navy and coast guard members are conducting rescue and relief operations in the affected areas under local arrangements. Five people have died so far in the cyclone 'Aila' in Bhola and Patuakhali districts. Of them three died in Chharfashion in Bhola and one each in Baufal and Galachipa in Patuakhali district, disaster management minister Abdur Razzaq said in a press briefing in Dhaka on Monday. He said prime minister Sheikh Hasina has already directed the MPs to visit the affected areas. Razzaq said damage and casualties were not severe as the wind speed caused by the cyclone was less. However, the height of the surges was much higher than before, 12 to 13 feet at places, forcing many people to seek shelter on rooftops. At places dams gave in due to the surge, flooding the areas inside the dams. The government granted 1000 metric tonnes of rice and Tk 12 lakh as relief for the affected people, the minister said adding there were already sufficient stocks of relief in the affected districts. bd
