Maximum sustained wind speed within 54 km of the storm centre is about 70 kph rising to 90 kph in gusts or squalls. Sea will remain very rough, the bulletin said. Maritime port of Mongla has been advised to keep hoisted danger signal number seven.

All fishing boats and trawlers over north Bay have been advised to remain in shelter till further notice. River traffic halted The weather has forced suspension of ferry movement since 8am Sunday on all rivers routes, Patuakhali river port official Md Shahidul Mia said. Fishermen are coming back from the sea because of high tide, said general secretary of fish traders committee Nimai Chandra from Kuakata. The rivers in the costal areas are flowing in high tide because of the depression in the bay, said Ahsan Azim from Charkajal. It had been raining sporadically in the coastal areas of Patuakhali since Saturday midnight, our correspondent said. Barguna wary The people of the coastal southern district of Barguna, hit by cyclone Sidr in late 2007, are living in constant fear on the news that a depression in the Bay of Bengal has deepened and still intensifying. Our correspondent says it has been raining sporadically since Saturday midnight and the sun has remained behind the clouds. Hundreds of fishing trawlers have returned to Pathorghata, Noli and Taltoli from the Bay until Sunday afternoon, said president of Barguna District Trawler Owners' Association Golam Mostafa Chowdhury. "We will start calling people to shelter buildings through megaphones as soon as the level of the signal is increased," said the team leader of cyclone preparation activities and member of Borguna Red Crescent Unit Zakir Hossain Miraj. b
