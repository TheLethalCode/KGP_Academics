 Dhaka, May 26 (bdnews24.com)The High Court on Tuesday deferred hearing on opposition BNP chief Khaleda Zia's writ petition against an executive order over her cantonment house to Wednesday. The bench of justices Syed Refaat Hossain and Moyeenul Islam Chowdhury heard the petition from 2pm to 4pm before adjourning the hearing for a second time until 2pm. The bench on Monday postponed the hearing until 2pm on Tuesday after Khaleda's lawyer appealed for time. Khaleda's chief counsel TH Khan sought one day to submit the third notice she received from the government on Sunday to leave the house by June 30. "We have to file affidavit that will need time," he said. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam also appealed for one day. After being refused by four High Court benches, the fifth bench on May 12 accepted the petition of the BNP chairperson. The government on Sunday served a third notice on the former prime minister to leave her Dhaka Cantonment house by June 30. Military lands and cantonments directorate served Khaleda the notice on April 20 asking her to vacate her cantonment house. Challenging the legality of the Apr 20 notice, the former prime minister filed a writ petition on May 3. In a modified notice on May 7, it asked the opposition BNP chief to leave the house within 15 days. The cabinet on April 8 cancelled the lease on the house on grounds that the leasing process had been faulty and that she violated lease terms. Khaleda responded to the government's first notice with a legal notice of her own on Apr 23. After murder of her husband, army chief-turned-president Zia, on May 30, 1981 during a military mutiny, his widow, Khaleda, was given another house in Gulshan in addition to the house in the cantonment the family had been living since the 1970s. The 2.72-acre mansion was originally the official home of the army chief, a position held by then Lt Gen Zia who then converted himself into a civilian head of state through martial law proclamations and controversial votes. Before the cabinet took the decision to cancel the lease, prime minister Sheikh Hasina said in parliament that she would ask the slain general's wife to vacate the house and that blocks of apartments would be built in the prime land for families of army officers killed in the Feb mutiny. bdne
