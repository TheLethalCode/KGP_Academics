They appealed for bail in four tax-evasion cases in which each of them has been sentenced eight years in jail. Sobhan along with his wife and sons Sadat Sobhan Tanvir and Sayem Sobhan surrendered before the Dhaka's Special Judge's Court at around 3:48pm. Judge Mozammel Hossain said they will be free until June 25 until when the High Court had stayed the proceedings of the cases. Then they will have to surrender before court after that date. A special judge's court handed down the sentence to Sobhan, his wife and their three sons on Sept. 30, 2007. The other son, Shafayet Sobhan, did not surrender. Kabir Uddin Molla, deputy tax commissioner of the National Board of Revenue, filed the case on July 25, 2007.

A Dhaka court on July 7 last year sentenced the business conglomerate chief to two years in jail for illegally possessing foreign currency. Afroza and Tanvir, Sayem Sobhan and Safayet Sobhan also received similar sentences in the same case. Dhaka metropolitan first additional sessions judge Md Abul Bashar also fined them Tk 10,000 each.
