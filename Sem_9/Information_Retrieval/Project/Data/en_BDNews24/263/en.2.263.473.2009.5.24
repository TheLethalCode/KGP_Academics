 TEHRAN, Sun May 24, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The presidents of Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan began talks in Tehran on Sunday on ways to combat terrorism, drug trafficking and other regional security problems.

In Pakistan on Saturday, the military said street fighting erupted in the main town of the Swat valley as security forces mounted a new phase of their offensive against the militants. The United States, which sees Pakistan as vital to its plan to defeat al Qaeda and bring stability in Afghanistan, has applauded Pakistani resolve to fight what some US leaders have called an "existential threat" to the country. The United Nations launched an appeal on Friday for $543 million for more than 2 million people displaced by fighting in northwest Pakistan, where officials said villagers were turning against the Tal
