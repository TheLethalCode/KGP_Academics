 PUTRAJAYA, Malaysia, Fri May 22, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Malaysian court handed control of the disputed northwestern state of Perak to the government on Friday in a move that will likely further inflame political tensions in the Southeast Asian country. The fight for peninsular Malaysia's second-largest state began when the ruling National Front government took control of the Perak state government in February through defections orchestrated by Najib Razak before he became premier in April. An appeal court on Friday overturned a decision last week that had handed power back to the national opposition. Hundreds of opposition supporters gathered outside the court, branding the court sitting a "shotgun session". "The only way is to go back to the people. The erosion of support towards Najib will get worse," Lim Kit Siang, one of the leaders of the country's three-party opposition alliance, told reporters. The court ruled that Perak's Sultan had been correct in naming the National Front as the state government following the defection of three opposition lawmakers, overturning an earlier decision that said the move was invalid. The tussle for control of Perak has triggered anti-government protests, with 90 people arrested earlier this month. The state, one of five won by the opposition People's Alliance when it scored its best-ever results in national and state polls in 2008, has passed from opposition control to the government twice. Najib, already less popular in opinion polls than the prime minister he replaced in April, has to grapple with the problems in Perak as well as slowing economic growth and a surging budget deficit as Asia's third most trade-dependent economy seeks to reinvent itself. The government is set to revise down its forecasts that the economy could shrink by one percent this year after growth data due next week . "Najib is in a rather pitiful situation, because despite winning one court battle, it is the battle for the hearts of the people that he has to think of," said Ooi Kee Beng of the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore. WHOLESALE REFORM Political uncertainty and a rising budget deficit, that will require around 99 billion Malaysian ringgit ($25.77 billion) of bond issues this year according to estimates from investment bank HSBC, have pushed A-rated Malaysian bond yields outside those of BBB-rated Thailand. Malaysian five-year bonds yield 3.846 percent versus 2.6 percent for Thailand. As well as dealing with his political woes and a fractured ruling coalition, Najib has promised fundamental reforms to Malaysia's economy which has depended on low-value electronics exports and cheap foreign labour to survive. To do that he will have to tackle a system of economic and social privileges for ethnic Malays who make up 64 percent of the population, a system critics say has damaged competitiveness and engendered corruption. So far, Najib has announced a series of small measures on liberalisation that have been welcomed by investors, but there has been no landmark reform as the country gets ready to enter its first recession since the 1998 Asian financial crisis. "Even if he does a relatively good job in managing the country, that will still not be enough. He will have to radically transform Malaysian economic policies to be given a fighting chance of being accepted," said political analyst
