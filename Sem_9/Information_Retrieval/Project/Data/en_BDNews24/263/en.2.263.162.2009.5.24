 Dhaka, May 24 (bdnews24.com)A committee will be formed by a parliamentary watchdog to investigate if the bribe money paid by the Germen industrial giant Siemens to government officials during the four-party alliance administration made its way to fuel militancy, telecoms minister Raziuddin Ahmed Razu said on Sunday. The minister told bdnews24.com that the committee will be formed in accordance with guidelines from the parliamentary standing committee. The next meeting of parliamentary standing committee scheduled for June may form the committee, he added. A report by David Montero published on May 11 on the website of US-based television channel Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) said in 2004, Siemens paid $5 million in bribes to government officials to secure a telecom deal with the government. The report said that according to court document filed by prosecutors at the US Department of Justice, Siemens had bribed the former telecommunications minister, Aminul Haque. "The documents didn't name the minister, but further investigation revealed that he was Aminul Haque. I also discovered that during the time Haque was receiving bribes from Siemens, he was also patronizing Jamat'ul Mujahadeen Bangladesh, or JMB, an Islamic militant group in Bangladesh," the report added. In its last part it said, "Although there is no evidence that money paid to Haque by Siemens made its way to JMB, it underscores how bribe money can easily fall into the wrong hands." Haque was sentenced to 31 years in prison in 2007 for aiding and abetting the JMB. bdn
