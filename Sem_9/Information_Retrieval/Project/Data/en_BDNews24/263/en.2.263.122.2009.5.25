"The Criminal Investigation Department is investigating. Many evidence have been found," he told reporters on Monday after a meeting with Bangladesh Mills Association delegation at the Secretariat. "We hope the charges will be pressed between one and a half months and two months." "The government wants a neutral investigation, quick submission of chargesheet and trial of the those guilty." On the government probe report, the minister said: "The report will be made public in future. The necessary parts of the report will be placed in parliament."
