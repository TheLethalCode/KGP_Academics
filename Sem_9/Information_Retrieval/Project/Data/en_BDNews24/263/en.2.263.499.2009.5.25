 Dhaka, May 25 (bdnews24.com)The law will take care if opposition leader Khaleda Zia does not vacate the cantonment house after the third notice, the law minister said on Monday. "According to law if any person does not leave the house or property even after issuance of the third notice, the government can file case and evict him or her," Shafiq Ahmed told reporters at the Secretariat. "If she does not vacate house by the time (June 30) legal action will be taken against her." The government on April 20 served the first notice asking her to leave the 6 Moinul Road house within 15 days. Later a supplementary notice was sent on May 7 and May 24 another notice was sent for the third time. The High Court on Monday adjourned the hearing on Khaleda's writ petition against the executive order until 2pm on Tuesday. bdne
