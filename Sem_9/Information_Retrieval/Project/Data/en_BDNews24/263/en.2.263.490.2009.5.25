 Dhaka, May 25 (bdnews24.com)BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain and three Supreme Court lawyers filed two petitions to the Supreme Court seeking permission to challenge a landmark High Court ruling that declared the fifth amendment of the constitution illegal. TH Khan, Delwar's counsel, said the government filed a leave to appeal against the ruling earlier but withdrew the appeal on May 3. Delwar earlier appealed to be an additional party to the appeal. The court accepted his appeal and ordered him to file leave to appeal within one month. On when the hearing would be held, Khan said the chief justice would set the date and added it could be June 21. The Appellate Division bench led by chief justice MM Ruhul Amin on May 4 ordered for filing leave to appeal on two petitions filed by the BNP secretary general and three Supreme Court lawyers Munshi Ahsan Kabir, Tajul Islam and Quamruzzaman Bhuiyan. The High Court bench of justices ABM Khairul Haque and ATM Fazle Kabir gave the ruling on Aug 29, 2005 upon a writ appeal challenging Martial Law Regulation-Seven, 1977 over the validity of then the military government. In the judgment, the High Court said that takeover of the powers of the government from Aug 15, 1975 by Khandkar Mostaque Ahmed placing Bangladesh under Martial Law Administration (MLA) and his assumption of the office of the president by the proclamation of August 20, 1975 were a clear violation of the constitution, illegal, and consequently all his subsequent actions were illegitimate and void. "The taking over of the office of president of Bangladesh, in favour of Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem, on November 6, 1975 being beyond the ambit of the constitution was void and illegal," the court observed. It observed that takeover of the office of the president of Bangladesh by Justice Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem and his assumption of the powers of Chief Martial Law Administration (CMLA) and appointment of the Deputy CMLA and the proclamation on November 8, 1975, were all in violation of the constitution, illegal and without jurisdiction and subsequently all functions and actions were illegal. "The handing over of the office of MLA to Major General Ziaur Rahman by Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem by third proclamation on November 29, 1976 and consequently all their subsequent functions and actions were illegal and illegitimate," the court further said. The court also observed that nomination of Major General Ziaur Rahman by Justice Sayem to become the president and the handover of the office of the president to him was illegal and without jurisdiction. "The assumption of the president of Bangladesh by Major General Ziaur Rahman on April 21, 1977 and nomination being beyond ambit of the constitution was illegal, and consequently all his subsequent functions and actions of such president are illegal and without jurisdiction," it said. It observed the Referendum Order-1977 (Martial Law) published on May 1, 1977, unknown to the constitution being made only to ascertain the confidence of people of Bangladesh by president Ziaur Rahman was illegal and void. The High Court said the violation of the constitution is a grave legal wrong and remain so far all time to come. It cannot be legitimate, however, all the necessitating of the state only such a legal wrong can be condoned in certain circumstances, and invoking Doctrine Sales Populist Supremacy Lex. "Martial Law Regulation 7 of 1977 is also illegal and violation of the legal one and legitimate of the necessitating such legal action can be done invoking Sales and Supremacy," the court said. The government, in 1972, declared the land of then Moon Cinema Hall at Wizeghat in Dhaka as an abandoned property and gave it to the Muktijoddah Kallyan Trust. Maksud Alam, the owner of the land, had filed a writ petition seeking the ownership of the land back in the High Court. The High Court, in 1977, had ordered the government to give back the property to the petitioner. But the government did not do so, stating that as per the Martial Law Regulation of 1977 the judgment was annulled. In 1994, he filed another writ petition in the High Court but it was rejected. Maksud, later managing director of Bangladesh Italian Marble Works Limited, in 2000 filed a writ petition in the High Court challenging the validity of the Martial Law Regulation. b
