 Dhaka, May 23 (bdnews24.com)  Commonwealth gold medallist shooter Asif Hossain was eliminated from the ISSF World Cup on Saturday after finishing 54th among 75 competitors in the qualifying round in Milan, Italy. Asif scored 588 out of 600 in his favourite 10m air rifle event. Asif, who bagged gold in the same event in the SAFF Shooting November last, had a bad start scoring 94 with the first shot, but he gradually improved to score 97, 100, 100, 99 and 98 with the rest shots. Asif was scheduled to leave Milan on Saturday for the German city of Wesbaden to receive high-profile training at the Wesbaden Olympic Training Centre for one month in a bid to earn a quota place in the 2012 London Olympics. The training will begin on May 24. Atikur Rahman will accompany Asif as a trainer. Asif won gold in the Commonwealth Games' 10m air rifle event in Manchester in 2002 as well as in the 2003 SAFF Games in Islamabad in Pakistan. bd
