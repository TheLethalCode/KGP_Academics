 PARIS, May 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World number one Rafael Nadal started his bid for a fifth consecutive French Open title by labouring past Brazilian qualifier Marcos Daniel 7-5 6-4 6-3 on Monday. The Spaniard, who is unbeaten at Roland Garros since his debut in the claycourt grand slam in 2005, needed two hours and 23 minutes to go past Daniel and set up a second round meeting with either Teimuraz Gabashvili or Igor Kunitsyn of Russia. Daniel mixed up his game with cunning drop shots to try and unsettle the four-times champion but Nadal stepped up a gear at 7-5 1-3. World number 97 Daniel got a break back in the eighth game of the third set but it was the Brazilian's final gasp and Nadal sealed the win on his opponent's serve on his first match point
