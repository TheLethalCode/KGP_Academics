 Dhaka, May 24 (bdnews24.com)bdnews24.com on May 23 ran a report headlined 'Direct tax may increase: Muhith' which contained wrong information. The news of our Sylhet correspondent quoted finance minister A M A Muhith at pre-budget discussion as saying, "Direct tax may see a rise, as we try to offset the recession impact". In fact, the finance minister had not announced any hike in the income tax rate. Instead, he had spoke about increasing the government's revenue income by bringing increased number of tax payers under the tax coverage. The National Board of Revenue pointed out the mistake and we appreciate its effort. We are sorry for the inadvertent mistake and regret the inconvenience that it may have caused.
