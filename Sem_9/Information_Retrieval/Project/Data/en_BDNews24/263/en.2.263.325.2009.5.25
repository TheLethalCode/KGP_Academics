 Dhaka, May 24 (bdnews24.com)The introduction of automation at Dhaka and Chittagong customs houses will help cut corruption and trading cost, government ministers said. Commerce minister Faruq Khan said the houses being directly related to import and export will also help to reduce price of commodities in the market. Finance minister A M A Muhith and Khan made their observations on Sunday evening while inaugurating Dhaka Customs House Automation System at Hotel Sonargaon in the city. Dhaka and Chittagong customs automation systems are good instances of the government's efforts to develop the country through public-private partnership (PPP), Muhith pointed out. "It will help increase trading. Cost of trading will also come down. Time will be saved. The process for import and export will be easy." "Above all, liability, transparency and accountability will be ensured." He said the government will take a great step toward fulfilling the vision of prime minister Sheikh Hasina to make Bangladesh digital by 2021 if two houses were fully automated. Many more such work will be done under the PPP, he said. Dhaka Customs House and Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry jointly took the initiative for Dhaka Customs House Automation. Dhaka Customs House will go into full operation of its automation work on July 1. Chittagong Customs House formally ran its automation work in last Oct.
