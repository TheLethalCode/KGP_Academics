 Dhaka, May 24 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh captain Mohammad Ashraful and his deputy Mashrafee Bin Mortaza are focusing on five practice matches in England ahead of the ICC Twenty20 World Cup scheduled for June 5 to 21. Ashraful and Mashrafee, who arrived Dhaka from South Africa on Friday and Saturday respectively, left for England on Sunday, a day after the departure of their team-mates. Despite having spent an idle time in the Indian Premier League in South Africa, both players think the lack of IPL matches will not affect them much and they are concentrating on five warm-up matches before facing India (June 6) and Ireland (June 8) in the main battle. "True, I haven't had enough matches in the IPL for the Mumbai Indians, but I think it will not affect me because I was practising hard in South Africa," Ashraful told reporters at Zia International Airport. "We are getting five warm-up matches in England to be prepared and I think it will make up for our lack of match practice," said the Bangladesh captain. Pace spearhead Mashrafee also believes he and his captain will benefit through the five warm-up matches and that they will be quite ready to face defending champions India and Ireland. "I don't think the lack of practice matches in the IPL will trouble us or hamper the team's combination as we have known each other for a long time. Besides, the five warm-up matches are equally important for us as well as the team," said Mashrafee. Bangladesh will play their first warm-up matches against New Zealand (May 26), Netherlands (May 28) and Scotland (May 29) at Wormsley. They will then play official warm-up matches against Australia (June 1) and Sri Lanka (June 2) in Nottingham before going into the main battle. Bangladesh have set their sights on the Super Eights and aiming to upset India in the first match and then rout Ireland, who upset Bangladesh in the 2007 ICC World Cup. "If we win both group matches against India and Ireland, we may have a hope of qualifying for the semi-finals by winning two out of three Super Eight matches," said Ashraful adding that in a Twenty20 match any side could do anything. However, Mashrafee was a bit realistic saying: "At the moment, India are a very strong side with their all players involved in the IPL. It is not impossible to beat them, but we all need to put up much more than hundred percent and we can beat them on the given day. bd
