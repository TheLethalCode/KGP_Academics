 ROME, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news ahead of this weekend's matches in Serie A (all on Sunday at 1300 GMT): Kaka says he sees his future at AC Milan regardless of whether Carlo Ancelotti is the club's coach next season. "I have a contract with Milan until 2013, not with Carlo Ancelotti," the Brazil playmaker told reporters ahead of Sunday's home clash with AS Roma. "Lots of things can happen in the future, but it's difficult for me to imagine myself far from Milan." Second-placed Milan have said they will clear up the uncertainty about Ancelotti, who has reportedly been lined up to take over at Chelsea next season, on Monday if they seal automatic qualification for next season's Champions League this weekend. Victory on Sunday would guarantee that. Italy midfielder Daniele De Rossi is suspended for sixth-placed AS Roma, who need a win to help fend off competition from Palermo for a place in next season's Europa League. Caretaker Juventus coach Ciro Ferrara is likely to be without captain Alessandro Del Piero in his first match in charge at Siena after a seven-match winless run cost Claudio Ranieri his job on Monday. The striker is a major doubt for the match, which the Turin club must win to be sure of staying in third and on course for automatic Champions League qualification, after taking a knock to his thigh in training. Czech midfielder Zdenek Grygera is out for the season's last two games because he too has a thigh problem, the club said on their website (www.juventus.com). Fiorentina, who are one point behind Juve in fourth, will be confident for their visit to almost-doomed bottom club Lecce, who are depleted by the suspensions of Dimitrios Papadopoulos, Axel Konan and Tiziano Polenghi. While coach Jose Mourinho said he was 99.9 percent sure he would not go to Real Madrid next season, Maicon said there was no chance the Spaniards' reported interest would tempt him from Inter Milan. "I'm 100 percent certain of staying here. I'm happy to be at this club, which has given me lots of faith and chances to show my football," the Brazil fullback, who has been out since March with a leg injury, told reporters. Inter, who clinched a fourth consecutive league title last weekend, visit Cagliari on Sunday. Palermo, who are two points behind Roma in seventh, cannot call on suspended Danish defender Simon Kjaer for their visit to Atalanta
