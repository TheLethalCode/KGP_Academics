<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 24 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) on Sunday decided to place a proposal to the sports minister on holding one or two matches of the 2011 ICC World Cup at the Bangabandhu National Stadium. "A unanimous decision was taken at the meeting that the board will officially place a proposal to the state minister for youth and sports on holding a couple of the ICC World Cup matches at the BNS," BCB spokesman Jalal Younus told bdnews24.com after the meeting. It is all but decided that the BNS will host the opening ceremony of the World Cup and the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium and Narayangnaj Fatullah Cricket Stadium will host the eight matches. "We are getting such demands of holding matches at the BNS from many Dhaka clubs. Besides, this venue is also historical one, which hosted the mini World Cup as well as Bangladesh's inaugural Test against India. But, there is no World Cup match at the venue and it is not right," said Younus. The BCB is also thinking of getting accreditation from the ICC to hold matches in Chittagong, which has been demanding to hold matches in the port city. The meeting also decided to make the head of the local organising committee among the board directors and he will be named in the next board meeting. It also made $10 million budget for the World Cup opening ceremony and it would be placed to the central organising committee meeting in Mumbai, said Younus. The BCB media chairman also informed that the players of participating teams would start to enter the capital from February 11, 2011. bdnew
