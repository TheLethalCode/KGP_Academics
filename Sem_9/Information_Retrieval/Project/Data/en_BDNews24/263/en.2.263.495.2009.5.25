<TEXT>
 Chandigarh, India, May 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thousands protested in Punjab on Monday after an attack in a Sikh temple in Austria, torching a train, vehicles and shops, police said. Authorities imposed a curfew on parts of the state and the army was put on standby after members mainly of the Dalit or "untouchable" community protested against the attack in Vienna that killed one of their leaders, according to police. "The situation remains tense but under control," said senior superintendent of police R.K Jaiswal, from Jalandhar where the violence was centred. Guru Sant Rama Nand, 57, died after the attack on Sunday when armed men attacked the preacher and worshippers with a gun and knives in the temple in the Austrian capital of Vienna. At least nine people were wounded. Austrian national news agency APA quoted witnesses as saying the preacher had travelled from India to Vienna to conduct the service even though members of rival temples had threatened violence if he appeared.
