<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 25 (bdnews24.com) Although the new draft industry policy says no more state-run mills will be privatised, the industries minister says the government will not privatise any running mills. "We'll not privatise those mills that are running. But initiatives will be taken to resume closed mills through public-private partnership," Dilip Barua told reporters after a seminar titled "SME Development: Status and Strategies" at the SME Fair. The Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industries (FBCCI) is organising the fair at Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre that will run through to May 27. Asked whether the government would take initiative to re-run the laid off industries individually, he said, "The announcement was already made regarding the re-opening of Chittagong Chemical Complex." "The government will reopen the potential industries after conducting feasibility studies," Barua said Earlier on Apr 25, the minister argued against privatisation move at the launch of new draft industry policy. The draft policy says the government will not privatise state-run industries considering the socio-economic condition. At the seminar, Barua stressed the need for development of small and medium industries to cushion the massive impact of global recession. He said that there was no alternative to developing local industries and diversify the utilities of export products. He said that there were around 60 lakh small, medium and micro industries in the country providing livelihood to about 3 crore of people directly or indirectly. Barua mentioned some problems involved with the industries like arranging fund, high bank interest rate, high tariff structure and complex banking system and role of the Department of Environment. The acting managing director of SME Foundation, Momtaz Uddin Ahmed, demanded the establishment of a separate bank to ease funding problem and develop the sector. Barua agreed . "SME entrepreneurs have funding problem. So the sector needs a separate bank." The minister urged the industry ministry, Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority and the Board of Investment to work together to make Bangladesh a industrialised nation. b
