<TEXT>
 Oxfordshire, May 25 (bdnews24.com) - With the captain and vice captain joining the rest of the group after nearly two months the spirit in the Tigers camp has gone up a notch. Mohammad Ashraful and Masrafe Bin Mortaza flew into England last night and after a decent nap headed for training in the morning. Both stars looked fresh and ready as the Bangladesh team had an extended Centre wicket training session of nearly four hours at the Ashton Rowant Cricket Club ground, a five-minute drive down the road from the team hotel and through the lush valleys and sunflower fields of a typical English village, according to a report filed by Tigercricket.com, the official website of the Bangladesh Cricket Board. This was probably not as picturesque as the breathtaking sceneries that soothe the eyes at the Wormsley Cricket Ground but the wicket and the outfield was perfect for preparation. At the start of the day the sky had cloud cover but slowly the sun came out and the intent shown by Masrafe and Ashraful came as a welcome sign after their separation with the national team due to IPL commitments. Practice focused on creating certain match situations and the bowlers and batsmen were challenged to execute certain plans. "Twenty20 is very positive cricket and you have to take initiatives with a positive mind frame. Although we did not play many matches still for me and Ash (Ashraful) the time at the IPL allowed us to study the game more and hopefully we have learned a few things that we can share with the coaching staff and the other players," said Mortaza. Bangladesh's first practice game will be at the Wormsley Cricket Ground Tuesday against New Zealand who are also staying at the same hotel. The match starts at 3:00pm local time (8:00pm Bangladesh Standard Time). After showing no side effects or jet-lag from the long flight from Dhaka both the captain and his deputy will play the game. The rest of the team will could be decided in the afternoon's tea
