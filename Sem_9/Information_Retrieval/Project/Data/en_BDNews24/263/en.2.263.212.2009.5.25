 Tokyo, May 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Schools in western Japan were re-opening their doors on Monday but continued to urge strict hygiene measures, as the number of new H1N1 flu infections levelled off. Japan's Health Ministry had confirmed 343 cases of the new flu as of late on Sunday. About 4,500 schools closed last week as the virus spread, mostly among teenagers in the western prefectures of Osaka and Hyogo. Japan is the worst-affected country in Asia in terms of the spread of the new H1N1 swine flu virus. South Korea said on Monday its number of confirmed flu cases rose sharply over the weekend to 22, when a 23-year-old woman, a U.S. citizen, who flew from San Francisco to teach English, was confirmed with the virus. Fourteen others who were in contact with her were also confirmed with the virus. Australia also announced a jump in numbers to 17, after a woman from Brisbane was tested positive after having returned from the United States. In Japan, the government had relaxed some of its regulations on dealing with the new strain of flu last week, concerned that they would harm the already ailing economy. World Health Organization chief Dr. Margaret Chan said on Friday that the world had to be ready for H1N1 swine flu to become more severe and kill more people. The WHO is poised to declare a full pandemic of the virus, which has infected more than 12,000 people in 43 countries and killed 86.
