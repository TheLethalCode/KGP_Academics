<TITLE> Deficit woes likely to dog dollar for some time </TITLE>

 New York, May 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - It was an awful week for the dollar, which sank to its lowest level of the year last week, and with markets now focused on a trillion-dollar-plus US deficit, the greenback's sharp slide is not over yet. Unlike in the recent past, when investors terrified of a global financial meltdown sought safety in Treasury bills and other dollar assets, the greenback is now being driven by its own fundamentals, and all of them look fairly bleak. Massive spending and unorthodox monetary policies over the last year have the United States looking down the barrel of a $1.75 trillion deficit. That reality took on a new relevance last week when Standard & Poor's said it may cut Britain's AAA credit rating because of soaring public debt, prompting fears that the United States could be next. Persistently sluggish U.S. growth and rising unemployment also suggest interest rates may be at zero for some time yet. That has started to frighten foreign investors away from U.S. assets altogether: U.S. Treasury yields spiked to six-month highs this week and the dollar has lost some 10 percent against a basket of currencies since March .DXY. "The charts suggest the dollar is oversold, but people are starting to ask existential questions about the United States," said T.J. Marta, founder and chief strategist at Marta on the Markets in Scotch Plains, New Jersey. "The fear is about how much the government can do -- it's underwriting the banking system, the insurance industry, the auto sector. At some point, people say, 'Oh my God, is the whole thing going to implode?'" The government has said it will need to borrow $2 trillion, or 14 percent of the country's total economic output, in 2009 alone. It has already spent most of a $700 billion rescue plan to prop up the banking system and juiced up the economy with a $787 billion fiscal stimulus plan. The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, is committed to buying $1.5 trillion in mortgage and agency debt issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and is making direct purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds to the tune of $300 billion. And it won't get any easier. The dollar could face more selling if Treasury struggles to attract many takers for $101 billion of fresh government debt this week. After that, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner heads to China, the biggest buyer of U.S. government debt, where he will have to reassure his hosts that the United States will be able to ensure the value of the dollar even as its deficits balloon. It all adds up to more gray skies for the dollar, with near-term rallies seen as excuses for renewed selling that could send the euro, which broke $1.40 last week for the first time since January, toward $1.45 and sterling toward $1.60. "There are half a dozen reasons to sell the dollar. Until we get an event to alter the course of events, traders will stay on the bandwagon," said Brian Dolan, chief strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey. UNWINDING SAFE-HAVEN FLOWS The dollar decline isn't new, of course. The value of the currency began eroding weeks ago as increased optimism about the global financial sector meant investors were no longer drawn to buying it as a safe-haven. Instead, they began searching for better returns in global stock markets or by purchasing higher-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar or Brazilian real. Steven Englander, a strategist at Barclays Capital in New York, said the safe-haven bid that boosted the dollar for months has only begun to unwind, suggesting more selling. What's more, financial sector conditions have improved to the point where investors no longer fear that another major bank failure such as the one that toppled Lehman Brothers last year lurks around the corner. That further dulls the need for a safe-haven and frees investors to consider the dollar impact of the massive amounts of money U.S. authorities have pumped into the banking system. That's worrisome since authorities in Canada, Australia and the euro zone have embraced far more conservative policies that are less likely to stoke deficits or inflation. "When investors were petrified about the potential downside, that wasn't a big issue," he said. "Now it's hard to back away from the longer-term concerns." Some analysts say the dollar will rebound later this year as U.S. policies start to help the economy recover, allowing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates before other central banks and increasing the dollar's allure. Indeed, if the euro and yen get much stronger, Marta said, Germany and Japan may increase Treasury purchases, which "would have a salutary effect." But for now, the bears are in control, with all the major market themes translating into dollar weakness. "If the news stream is good, we are told investors are less risk averse and do not need the dollar's security," said Brown Brothers Harriman currency strategist Marc Chandler. "If the news stream is poor, we are told the U.S. is in horrific shape and the budget deficit will swell even more. It is difficult to see what will break this psychology in the coming weeks."
