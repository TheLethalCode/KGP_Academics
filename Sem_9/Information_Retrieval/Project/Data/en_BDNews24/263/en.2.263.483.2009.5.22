 Sylhet, May 22 (bdnews24.com)The finance minister on Friday said the ongoing global economic recession has not impacted the financial sectors and remittance inflow. "Remittance inflow was higher in the current fiscal year compared to the previous fiscal year," AMA Muhith said after launching 'Remittance Fair' in Sylhet. The minister urged the expatriates to send in money through banks and avoid 'hundi', money sent through illegal channel' to enrich the economy. "The expatriates are playing a vital role in the economy. Discarding the hundi is a must for a richer economy," he said. Muhith acknowledged the Sylhet expatriates' contribution to the country's remittance inflow. "The lion's share of remittance comes from the expatriates from Sylhet region." "There must be initiatives for the welfare of the expatriates. There must be a strengthened banking network so that even village people can benefit from it," he said. Organisers of the three-day fair said the exposition was an initiative to encourage the expatriates to not send in money through hundi. As many as 27 government, private and foreign banks are presenting their services related to remittance and expatriate banking. bdnews24
