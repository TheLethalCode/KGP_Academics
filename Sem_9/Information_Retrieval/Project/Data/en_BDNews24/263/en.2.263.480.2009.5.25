Dhaka University vice-chancellor professor AAMS Siddique led the DU teachers to pay their respects to the poet and social thinker. After a brief discussion on Nazrul there, Ustaad Alauddin and Khalid Hossain rendered songs. "Even after a century, the rebel poet's songs, poetry and myriad other writings continue to enchant us," said Siddique. The memorial under construction near Nazrul's grave will be hopefully completed and inaugurated during the forthcoming birth anniversary, he said. Khilkhil Kazi said, "I miss my grandfather. His birth anniversaries should be observed in a more colourful manner." The poet's grandson Arindam said, "I live in India. I'd like to see my grandpa's birthdays celebrated with due solemnity and fervour here."
