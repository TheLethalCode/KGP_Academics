 Colombo, May 24 (bdnews24.com) Sri Lanka's Tamil Tigers rebels have admitted for the first time that their leader Velupillai Prabhakaran is dead. Reported BBC online. The BBC's Charles Haviland says that a statement issued by the Tigers said their "incomparable leader" had "obtained martyrdom". The Sri Lankan army last week released pictures which it said showed the body of Prabhakaran. It said he was killed as he tried to flee a last stand by rebels in the north-east of the island. The statement was signed by the defeated group's head of international relations, Selvarasa Pathmanathan. In an interview with the BBC, he said Prabhakaran had died on 17 May but did not give details of the circumstances. Mr Pathmanathan said the Tigers would now use non-violent methods to fight for the rights of Tamils. Story from BBC
