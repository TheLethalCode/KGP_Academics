 KOLKATA, May 25 (bdnew24.com/Reuters) - A cyclone hit West Bengal on Monday, flooding villages and forcing thousands of people from their homes, officials said. Authorities began evacuating thousands from two coastal southern districts and warned people living in Kolkata to stay indoors, as cyclone Aila advanced towards the biggest city in the region, packing winds up to 100 kph (60 mph). It was about 130 km (80 miles) south of Sagar Island, the world's biggest riverine delta, and was expected to hit Kolkata by late afternoon, authorities said. "The situation is very grave, countless families have been displaced, especially in the Sundarbans," said Kanti Ganguly, West Bengal state minister for the Sundarbans. The region holds thousands of people as well as the world's biggest tiger reserve. Heavy rains triggered by the cyclone raised river levels and burst mud embankments in at least three places in the Sundarbans Tiger Reserve, flooding homes. At least 500 families have been displaced in Sundarbans, and authorities said they were giving shelter to thousands of people inside schools and government buildings
