<TEXT>
 BAGHDAD, May 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Katyusha rocket blasted Baghdad's fortified government and military Green Zone compound overnight, killing a civilian working for the U.S. Department of Defense, the US military said on Saturday. They gave no further details, except to say that the attack occurred at around 8.15 p.m. (1:15 a.m. EDT) on Friday night. Earlier, an Iraqi police official said the rocket had hit a munitions store in the compound, causing an explosion and a fire but no casualties. The zone used to be a regular militant target for mortar or rocket fire, but attacks slowed to a trickle in the past year. At the end of November, a rocket or mortar attack on the Green Zone killed at least two foreign workers and wounded many.
