 Dhaka, May 24 (bdnews24.com)The European Commission has pledged support to modernise madrasa education system many see as a breeding ground for Islamic militancy so that the madrasa students get jobs after studies. European Commission envoy Stefan Frowein on Sunday saw state minister for foreign affairs Hasan Mahmud at his office and discussed the "streamlining" of the madrasa education and other bilateral issues. Frowein also said a mission of the European Troika would arrive between June 7 and 9 to discuss democracy and human rights in Bangladesh. The Trioka team, with delegation from the EU's current and future presidencies, would have talks with prime minister Sheikh Hasina and other high government officials. "We spoke as well about education, we spoke about madrasa education, we spoke about the necessity to streamline Madrasa education and make sure that it respects the national curriculum that produces results in the field of writing, reading, and understanding. "And that produces people who can find the job on the basis of their learning in the schools," Frowein told reporters after the meeting. "The European Commission is very supportive of the idea." "He has assured me of providing assistance to modernise Bangladesh's education system," Hasan Mahmud told reporters. The minister declined to elaborate on the discussion on the modernisation. The issue of modernising Madrasa education came up for discussion as there are allegations that most of the Madrasa students were fanatic Muslims involved in extremism and political violence. A groups of controversial Islamic thinkers in 1970s set up a board for Kawmi education that has no ties to national curriculum. The Kawmi madrasa teaches Islamic affairs, Arabic and Persian languages instead of Bangla and English. "The ambassador has told me that the Troika mission will arrive between 7 and 9 next month," Mahmud said. European Troika is involved in dialogues with the third world countries on issues of mutual interest. Frowein said the last European Troika came to Bangladesh in June 2007. HR commission, shrimp export The EC ambassador said he also discussed with the minister for passage of a bill in parliament's next session to set up a national human-rights commission. He also talked on the possible ways of restoring Bangladesh's shrimp export to the EU countries. The government as per the suggestion of the exporters suspended shrimp exports to EU market for six months as laboratory testing detected presence of an injurious antibiotic in Bangladeshi shrimps. Bangladesh's annual shrimp export to EU countries is about 500 million euros, according to the local EC office.
