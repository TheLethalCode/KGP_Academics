 Dhaka, May 24 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court has acquitted former Awami League MP and graft convict Haji Mohammed Selim and three others in Jubo Dal leader Hannan murder case. Judge Masder Hossain of Speedy Trial Tribunal-1 handed down the verdict. Selim's lawyer Prannath told bdnews24.com that there were 137 cases against his client and he had got acquittal some cases and the High Court froze several others. All cases had been filed to politically persecute him, he claimed. "We have appealed to the Dhaka deputy commissioner to withdraw the cases," the lawyer said. According to case details, Haji Selim and his associates picked up BNP's youth front Jatiyatabadi Jubo Dal leader Hannan from the Jubo Dal office and took him to Balur Ghat Mathh on Mar 30, 2004. Selim along with cohorts Hedayetul Islam, Golam Rahman, Ali Ahmad, Delwar Hossain, Mofizul Islam Dudu and Buddha Dome shot Hannan at the chest and other parts of the body and killed him. Buddha Dome was lynched by a mob when he tried to flee. Local Jubo Dal president Rafiqul Islam filed a case with Kotwali Police Station against six people on Apr 31 that year. Hedayetul and Mofiz died during the trial. On April 27 last year, he was sentenced to 13 years in jail in his absence on twin charges of suppressing wealth information and accumulating illegal wealth. A Dhaka court on May 20 sent him to jail after he surrendered. The court refused him bail after the Dhaka Metropolitan AL joint general secretary turned himself in to the court that had convicted him. The judge had also fined him Tk 10 lakh with a legal binding that the convict will have to serve another year in prison in failure to pay the fine. The court sentenced Selim's wife Gulshan Ara to three years in jail for assisting him in accumulating wealth. The court fined her Tk 1 lakh and she will stay six more months in jail if she fails to pay the fine. His wife is still on the run. bdne
