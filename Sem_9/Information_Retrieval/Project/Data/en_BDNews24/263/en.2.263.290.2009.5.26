<TEXT>
 HANOI, Tue May 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian and European Union foreign ministers will urge Myanmar on Tuesday to release opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other detainees in a strongly worded statement to be released at the end of a meeting in Vietnam. Diplomats said China, which is one of Myanmar's biggest backers, adopted a fresh, more critical tone when the issue was debated at the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) late on Monday, as Suu Kyi's trial for violating the terms of her house arrest entered its second week. Myanmar's Foreign Minister Nyan Win was "defensive", some said, and the regime was possibly taken aback by the unity of opposition to the trial of Suu Kyi, who stands accused of violating her house arrest terms after an American man swam uninvited to her lakeside home. China's intervention had been "very constructive on this point, and it was also constructive on the point of the North Korean nuclear test", Finland's Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb said on Tuesday. The ASEM foreign ministers on Tuesday condemned North Korea's second nuclear test, urged Pyongyang to refrain from future tests and called on it to return to the Six-Party Talks process. "We can certainly say that they have not been pushing on the brake. I'm not saying that they're pushing on the accelerator either, but they are not holding things up," Stubb said. "LOUD AND CLEAR" He said Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi "did mention political prisoners and he did talk about the dangers of the nuclear test in North Korea. So the message that we got in the meeting room was loud and clear". Another senior European diplomat, who declined to be identified, said Yang did not mention Suu Kyi by name, "but he de-facto did". "It was a new tone from China on the question of Burma. That, I think, can be said. There's no question about it," the diplomat said. Yang declined to comment specifically on Tuesday, telling Reuters only that the meetings in Hanoi of ASEM's 45 members had so far been very good. Asked about the statements, Yang said "it's a consensus". Last week, after the military junta that rules Myanmar put Suu Kyi on trial, China's foreign ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu said Myanmar should be left to handle its own affairs. In Beijing on Tuesday he said there had been no change in this position. The call for Myanmar to release the Nobel Peace Prize winning Suu Kyi will be included in a sweeping final statement at the end of the meeting later on Tuesday. The North Korea remarks were made in a separate document. Myanmar's Foreign Minister Nyan Win declined repeatedly to comment to journalists on the sidelines of the Hanoi meeting, but diplomats said that in bilateral meetings and the larger forum he defended the regime's charges and the trial of Suu Kyi. Bill Rammell, Britain's junior foreign minister, did not mention China specifically, but agreed there was a new tone on Myanmar among some at the meeting. "I sensed that there's actually been a shift on this issue," he said, noting that Thailand had already spoken out firmly. "I think other states are engaging on this in a way that wasn't the case in the past... If I'm honest I think the Burmese regime has miscalculated and has been somewhat taken aback by the force of international reaction." The global financial crisis, pandemic flu and climate change were among other issues on the agenda of the two-day Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM), involving 45 member count
