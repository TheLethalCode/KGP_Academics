<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 23 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh needed more modern granaries for adequate food stocks to ensure food security, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation has said. A FAO team led by Ad Spijkers, the resident representative, toured with food minister Abdur Razzaq and agriculture minister Motia Chowdhury in Bogra, Naogaon and Jessore for the two days to observe the situation. A press release released on Saturday quoted Spijkers as saying that the potentials of the southern agriculture were important to face the challenges for future Bangladesh that would need investment, technology and coordinated efforts of research and extension. The FAO delegation called 'for an immediate action plan for water including the Gorai River revival in the south to boost Boro and other winter crop cultivation'. Spijkers highlighted the FAO's on-going programme for the south particularly supporting 1.4 million Sidrhit farmers. He expected to launch a massive programme for input support with the fund of World Bank. The representative also pledged continuous support of FAO for sustainable agricultural development and food security. Razzaq said farmers should get the benefit of the price of rice declared by the government. The government would build new silos in the northern districts to help the farmers with more price support in the harvest time, he added. Motia said the agricultural development topped the priority list of the government which was making every effort to ensure food production, self-sufficiency and food security. Motia also spoke highly of the enormous potentials of the south and southwestern agricultural development. b
