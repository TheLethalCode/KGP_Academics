 Dhaka, May 25 (bdnews24.com)The finance ministry has decided to set aside block allocation in the forthcoming budget to fund the war crimes trial, finance minister AMA Muhith said on Monday. However, the decision has to be approved by the cabinet before the budget is in place, Muhith told reporters after attending a meeting with the liberation war affairs ministry and representatives of nine other organisations. "We discussed with all the parties involved with the trial process how the trial will be initiated, who'll do what and how the relevant activities will be financed," said the minister. "I've assured all concerned of the required fund allocations, making them available through lump sum grants. "We're advancing cautiously. Those who'll be directly involved in the execution of the plans must have a lot to do." Law minister Shafiq Ahmed, home minister Sahara Khatun, planning minister and Sector Commanders Forum president AK Khandaker, state minister for law Kamrul Islam, state minister for liberation war affairs AB Tajul Islam, Ghatak Dalal Nirmul Committee convenor Shahriar Kabir, War Crimes Trial Citizens Commission chairman justice Golam Rabbani and others were present in the meeting. Home minister Sahara Khatun told reporters that as preparatory steps to executing the war crimes trial, forming an investigation cell, constituting tribunal and appointing prosecutors have been accomplished. But the process, she stressed, should need a lot of money as a huge number of people will require to be talked to at home and abroad. "We sat with the finance minister to find ways of mobilising funds for the process. The finance minister assured us of lump sum allocations in the next budget for the purpose," said Khatun. "'Finance shouldn't be a constraint to holding the trial', the finance minister said. We must hold the trials, no one can stop us from realising that mandate," reiterated Khatun. Ahmed, the law minister, said, "The government will thwart any conspiracy to stall or foil the trial process." "The trial process must be completed at any cost. The finance ministry will provide funds for meeting the related expenses." AK Khandaker, the planning minister, said, "It is our moral responsibility to try the war criminals." "People gave us mandate during the polls to perform that particular act. All obstacles impeding the war crimes trial process must be removed." Asked if the Pakistani war criminals will be made to face any trial like their erstwhile Bangladeshi counterparts, the Sector Commanders Forum president said, "I also want it very much that the Pakistani war criminals should face trials." "But with the passage of time, the situation has changed. The possibility of trying the Pakistani offenders has to be examined closely." bdne
