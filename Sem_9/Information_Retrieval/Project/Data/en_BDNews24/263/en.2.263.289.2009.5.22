 Dhaka, May 22 (bdnews24.com)Foreign minister Dipu Moni, now in London on a private visit, has had talks with two British cabinet ministers including foreign secretary David Miliband, with the war crimes trial in Bangladesh topping the agenda. A foreign ministry statement issued in Dhaka on Friday said Dipu Moni received a call from Miliband on Thursday and assured him of meeting international standards in the trial of 1971 war criminals. "The foreign minister of Bangladesh briefed the secretary of state about the government's initiative to try the perpetrators of crimes against humanity during the War of Liberation of Bangladesh," said the statement issued by foreign ministry. "She also mentioned that the government would ensure that due processes are followed and that international standards are met," it said. "The move is a reflection of the people's will that mandated the government to bring the perpetrators to justice and set the records rightonce and for all," the statement quoted Dipu Moni as saying. Parliament on Jan. 29 adopted a unanimous resolution on the trial of war crimes. The Bangladesh foreign minister sought Miliband's support in resolving the problems of Bangladeshi expatriates, serving Britain's curry industry, after the introduction of points-based system of immigration. She also received a call from Douglas Alexander, the secretary of state for international development. Dipu Moni pointed out to Miliband that the stricter immigration measures adopted by the UK authorities under the points-based-system adversely impacted the curry industry, the economic backbone of the British-Bangladeshi community. She called for special measures to address the grievances of the industry, which represents important economic and cultural links between the two countries The statement said Miliband assured her of taking the matter up with the relevant authorities. The points-based system of immigration stipulated good English knowledge as one of the conditions for working in the UK's thousands of restaurants dominated by Bangladeshi workers. Most of the Bangladeshi restaurant workers are poor at English. The secretary of state appreciated the prudent handling of BDR tragedy in the immediate aftermath of the government's assumption of office, according to the statement. Alexander, whose department handles the single largest bilateral aid to Bangladesh, told Dipu Moni that Bangladesh's economic performance in the face of global economic meltdown was good. "He (Alexander) was confident that the development partnership between the two countries would cover wider expanse with an elected government at the helm of affairs in Dhaka," the statement added. He also appreciated the macro-economic achievements of Bangladesh.
