 CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida, May 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bad weather forced the cancellation of the landing of the space shuttle Atlantis on Saturday, and NASA said it would try to bring it back to Earth on Sunday. "The weather at the Kennedy Space Center (in Florida) has not cooperated ... we are waiving for the day," a NASA official said. Clouds and rain showers over Florida caused NASA flight directors on Friday to keep the shuttle and its seven-member crew in orbit an extra day after its Hubble Space telescope repair mission. Too much rain or too many clouds violates the space agency's criteria for a safe landing. NASA has four scheduled opportunities on Sunday for Atlantis to land either at Kennedy Space Center in Florida or at the alternative touchdown site at the Edwards Air Force Base in California. Atlantis has enough supplies to stay in orbit until Monday after its 12-day mission that repaired and upgraded the Hubble Space Telescope. Due to the unstable weather over Florida, NASA is staffing its backup landing site at Edwards Air Force Base in California's Mojave Desert. Landing in California costs NASA more than $1 million and it takes a week or two to prepare and transport the shuttle on top of a jet carrier aircraft back to Florida for its next launch. As NASA focused on the Atlantis landing on Saturday, the White House announced President Barack Obama would nominate Charles Bolden, a 62-year-old, four-time space shuttle astronaut and retired Marine major general, to serve as NASA's new administrator. HUBBLE TELESCOPE UPGRADED The space agency is trying to finish up eight flights on the shuttle's manifest before the shuttle fleet is retired by the end of 2010. NASA is targeting its next shuttle mission for launch in three weeks. Shuttle Endeavour, which was on standby as a rescue vehicle for the Atlantis crew, is scheduled to deliver an outdoor porch for the Japanese laboratory on the International Space Station. NASA wanted the standby rescue capability since the Atlantis crew on their mission to the Hubble observatory could not reach the station if their ship was too damaged for the supersonic return flight through the atmosphere for landing. NASA has been worried about possible heat shield damage to shuttles since the 2003 loss of shuttle Columbia. The Atlantis crew had used laser imagers to inspect their ship's heat shield after reaching orbit. NASA determined the shuttle is in good shape for landing. On their mission, the astronauts conducted five consecutive days of spacewalks to refurbish the highly productive Hubble telescope, which has been in orbit since 1990. Hubble was outfitted with a new panchromatic wide-field camera that is expected to be able to image objects formed about 500 million years after the birth of the universe. The Atlantis astronauts also left Hubble with a new light-splitting spectrograph to investigate the chemical composition of gas and dust between the galaxies. Astronomers are curious to learn how early structures like galaxies came into existence. The first images from the rejuvenated Hubble are expected in September.
