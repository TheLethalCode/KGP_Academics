 ATHENS, May 22 (bdnews24.com/ Reuters) Greek riot police fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of Muslims who pelted them with sticks and stones outside parliament on Friday during protests over what they said was the destruction of a Koran by a Greek policeman. The Muslim Union of Greece says that during police checks at a Syrian-owned coffee shop, an officer took a customer's Koran, tore it up, threw it on the floor and stomped on it.

"Police told us they need more time for the internal investigation so we went ahead and filed a suit," union president Naim Elghandour told Reuters. Thousands of immigrants, many from Muslim countries, cross into Greece illegally every year seeking a better life in the West. Trapped in legal limbo, most have no jobs, live in squalid conditions and are often arrested for minor crimes. On May 9, members of a rightist group attacked immigrants in Athens, sending at least three to hospital. Rights groups accuse predominantly Orthodox Christian Greece of not doing enough to protect immigrants. Greece has said repeatedly that the burden of being the main entry point for illegal immigration into Europe is too heavy to bear alone and has asked its EU partners for h
