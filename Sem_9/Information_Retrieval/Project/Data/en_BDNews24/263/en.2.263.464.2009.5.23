 Dinajpur, May 23 (bdnews24.com) The law enforcers have arrested only those BDR members who mutinied in sectors and battalions across the country after the Feb 25 Peelkhana carnage, the chief of the border guards said on Saturday. "The members were arrested only after identification and sued on sedition charge," director general major general Moinul Islam said at a darbar at Dinajpur sector headquarters. Moinul said he was visiting the sectors, battalions and border out posts across the country to reconstitute the force. "We will take the force to its previous state as early as possible," he said. "Otherwise the smugglers and enemies of the country will take the advantage of the weakness." The BDR head thanked the guards at the border outposts for sticking to their tasks and not joining in with their fellows during the rebellion. "The force is still upright on these dedicated and patriotic soldiers," he said. Moinul later visited Dinajpur-2 Rifles Battalion, Phulbari 40 Battalion and Hili port and spoke to the frontier guards at the border outposts. He also exchanged views with customs officials and clearing and forwarding traders. bdn
