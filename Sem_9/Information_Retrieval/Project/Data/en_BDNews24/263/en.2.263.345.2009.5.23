<TITLE> Tigers off to England </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 23 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh cricket team left for England on Saturday aiming to qualify for the Super Eight stage of the ICC Twenty20 World Cup that takes place from June 5 to 21. But captain Mohammad Ashraful and vice-captain Mashrafee Bin Mortaza will fly out Monday to join the team. Ashraful was scheduled to arrive here on Sunday from South Africa after spending most of the time on the sidelines for Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League like Mashrafee, who reached home on Friday. Both players appeared in a single IPL match after their respective sides were virtually out of the title race. Bangladesh, who are pitted in Group A along with defending champions India and ICC associate member Ireland, are dreaming of starting their campaign by upsetting India. Victory against India on June 6 will all but take Bangladesh to the Super Eights before facing Ireland two days later. "It's a Twenty20 game and that is the main concern. You can get knocked out at any stage, but realistically we should make Super Eights. We are hoping to beat India first, not waiting for the Ireland game," Bangladesh coach Jamie Siddons told reporters a few days back. The Australian, before leaving Dhaka, explained where the Tigers' confidence lay. "The depth of our batting order makes me want to dream. Look at Mushi (Mushfiqur Rahman), who is batting at number six, following by Riad (Mahmudullah) at number seven and Mash (Mashrafee) at number eight and I think our batting order has much depth." The onus will definitely be on Bangladesh's top order to build a platform for the middle order to tame India as well as Ireland, who will play in familiar conditions. The Tigers will especially wary of the Irish threat after losing to the minnows in the 2007 World Cup in the West Indies. "If you feel pressure it will hamper your play," said Bangladesh opener Tamim Iqbal, whose well-composed fifty sank India in the 2007 World Cup. The left-handed opener said, "Look, there is no alternative but perform to the best of one's ability in order to beat a team like India." All-rounder Shakib Al Hasan also played a key innings against Indians in that memorable match. "Earlier we upset India in a one-day match, but this time we will play in a totally different format, a Twenty20 match, in which any side can win the game," said a Shakib. The world's number one all-rounder did not forget mentioning that India are the reigning champions and whose players are at their peak at the moment due to the IPL. "We have nothing to lose. The June 6 match may be ours if we can perform our best," said the confident left-arm spinner. Bangladesh will play three warm-up matches against New Zealand (May 26), Netherlands (May 28) and Scotland (May 29) at Wormsley. The Tigers will then take on Australia (June 1) and Sri Lanka (June 2) in the official practice games in Nottingham. bd
