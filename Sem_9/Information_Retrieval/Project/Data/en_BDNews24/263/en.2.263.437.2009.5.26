 Seoul, May 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - North Korea, condemned by the international community for its latest nuclear test, on Tuesday accused the United States of being hostile and was reportedly ready to test-fire more short-range missiles. In a move likely to heighten tension in the region, South Korea said it would join a U.S.-led initiative to intercept ships suspected of carrying weapons of mass destruction, something Pyongyang has warned it would consider a declaration of war. Monday's nuclear test, the North's second after one in 2006, drew a sharp rebuke from regional powers, and U.S. President Barack Obama called Pyongyang's atomic arms programme a threat to international security. Underlining concerns over how far the North might be prepared to raise the stakes, Obama assured South Korean President Lee Myung-bak of Washington's unequivocal commitment to his country's defense on the long-divided peninsula where some two million troops face off. Pyongyang said the United States was being hostile, its long-held argument to justify efforts to build a nuclear arsenal, which years of international negotiations have failed to block. "Our army and people are fully ready for battle ... against any reckless U.S. attempt for a pre-emptive attack," the North's KCNA news agency said. In a unanimous statement adopted just hours after the nuclear blast, the U.N. Security Council decided to start work immediately on a new resolution, condemning the test as a "clear violation" of a previous resolution banning such tests in 2006. "The members of the Security Council have decided to start work immediately on a Security Council resolution on this matter," said the nonbinding statement read after a closed-door meeting by Russian U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin. The North also fired off three short-range missiles from its east coast missiles bases on Monday. The Yonhap news agency quoted an unnamed South Korean official as saying it was likely to launch more, this time from its west coast, either on Tuesday of Wednesday. In Seoul, financial markets have largely recovered from their initial shock following the nuclear test, but remain nervous about the escalating tension in a region that accounts for about a sixth of the global economy. Top South Korean financial officials also met to discuss the latest developments. The nuclear test has drawn outrage in the South, which is still mourning Saturday's apparent suicide of former President Roh Moo-hyun. It is also bound to raise concerns about proliferation, a major worry of the United States which has in the past accused Pyongyang of trying to sell its nuclear know-how to states such as Syria. SCALE OF BLAST DEBATED Analysts said the North opted for a nuclear test sooner than expected to draw the attention of the Obama administration and to raise the stakes for potential direct negotiations. It also sought to strengthen the power base of leader Kim Jong-il to lay the ground for succession, they said. Russia said the blast was about equal in power to the U.S. atomic bomb dropped on the Japanese city of Nagasaki in World War Two. That bomb had an explosion of about 20 kilotons. Other estimates said the North's nuclear device had a lower yield. One kiloton equals 1,000 tonnes and indicates the explosive yield of about that much weight of TNT. North Korea was under a Security Council resolution that banned activities related to nuclear and ballistic missile tests and subject to sanctions imposed under that 2006 resolution. "North Korea can only be hawkish this time, because time's running out for Kim Jong-il," said Jang Cheol-hyeon, an expert at the Institute for National Security Strategy in Seoul and a former official at the Workers Party of North Korea. Kim wants to seal a deal with the United States quickly and seek a swift and sharp improvement in the country's economy before he can publicly anoint one of his sons to succeed him, Jang said. "The recent military moves are yet another signal of trying to invite the U.S. to negotiations," he said.
