 ROME, May 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Soccer agent Vinicio Fioranelli says the Swiss consortium he represents is keen to buy Italian club AS Roma, but the outlook for the deal remains clouded. Serie A side Roma, owned by oil storage company Italpetroli and the Sensi family, have missed out on the lucrative Champions League for next season and fans have demanded fresh investment. However, Fioranelli said the situation was complicated. "We have the opportunity to move forward but it doesn't depend on the Sensi family, more on us," Fioranelli told reporters late on Friday. "It is not that we don't want clarity, the situation will become clear when it is clear. But things are not clear at the moment." Roma said in a statement last week they were aware of interest but that the group had not shown enough financial resources for "the maintenance and competitive level of the club". Runners-up in Serie A last season, Roma have been the subject of interest for several years and earlier this month pharmaceutical magnate Francesco Angelini said he wanted to buy 60 or 70 percent of the listed club's shares. Billionaire financier George Soros walked away from talks last year
