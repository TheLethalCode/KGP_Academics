 Dhaka, Apr 22 (bdnews24.com)BDR authorities have sent a list of names and photos of over 100 fugitive border guards to police and law-enforcing agencies that have been involved with Operation Rebel Hunt since the Feb 25-26 Peelkhana mutiny. "Many of the fugitives reported to police stations and BDR camps around the country soon after government announced a bounty of Tk 50,000 for information leading to their capture," BDR chief Maj Gen Moinul Islam told bdnews24.com Wednesday. Thousands of BDR members fled their Dhaka headquarters in the wake of the armed uprising by rebel border guards. Most reported back to work in line with a government directive issued early March, while others were arrested up and down the country. Earlier this month, authorities said some 800-1100 BDR members were still absconding. Investigating agencies later revised the number to around 200. The home ministry announced the Tk 50,000 bounty on Apr 7. "Around 100 are still on the run. We have sent the list of names and photos to police stations, Rebel Hunt members and others concerned," said Gen Moinul on Wednesday. bdnews
