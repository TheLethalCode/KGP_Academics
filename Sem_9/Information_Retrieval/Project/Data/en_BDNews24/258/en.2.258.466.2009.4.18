<TEXT>
 ROME, April 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Coach Jose Mourinho said he is confident Zlatan Ibrahimovic will stay at Inter Milan because no one is willing to fork out the huge sums needed to lure the Swedish forward away from the Serie A leaders. "I don't expect there to be an offer for Ibra in the summer because everyone knows an offer of 40, 50 or 60 (million euros) would be rejected immediately," Mourinho told a news conference. "No one will be able to make an offer of 100 million. I'm absolutely certain no offers will arrive because clubs don't make stupid offers. They don't make stupidly low offers and a stupidly high one won't arrive.
