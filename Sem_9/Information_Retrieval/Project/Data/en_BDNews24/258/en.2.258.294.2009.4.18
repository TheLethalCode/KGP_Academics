 Dhaka, April 18 (bdnews24.com)Madrasa teachers, after meeting the law minister on Saturday, appeared to put aside differences with the government over bringing the Kawmi madrasa system "into the mainstream" of education. "They seek recognition," Shafiq Ahmed told reporters after meeting a delegation of teachers representing some of the 15,000 or so Kawmi madrasas, or Islamic schools, that hold some 25-30 lakh students countrywide. "The government wants, through registration, to bring the madrasas into the mainstream, meaning religious education along with modern and scientific education," said the law minister. "The teachers have said they want this too." Mufti Imamuddin, leader of the teachers' delegation that met with Shafiq, said: "The government has spoken of introducing all types of education in Kawmi madrasas. We also want that." "We have told the minister that religious education has to be made compulsory up to Class Eight. We do not want that a madrasa student will not know how to recite the holy Koran." "But we also want recognition by the government," he said. A 62-strong delegation of religious leaders also met with the prime minister on Saturday. After a one-hour meeting at Sheikh Hasina's official Hare Road residence, they said the prime minister asked them to submit a proposed syllabus to be included under a new national education policy being formulated by the government. Hasina assured them of every type of assistance under the new policy, they said. Meanhwile, the law minister stressed again that a recently reported comment of his linking madrasas with militancy was a misquote by the media. Some newspapers earlier in the month had reported Shafiq as saying Kawmi madrasas were "dens for militants", sparking strong protests by many in the Alim community, including calls for the minister's resignation, although he denied making the comment. Imamuddin also told reporters Saturday: "The law minister has assured us he did not make any such comment. It was sensational reporting by the media." b
