 TOKYO, April 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Donors pledged over $5 billion in new aid -- more than originally expected -- over the next two years to cash-strapped Pakistan on Friday after President Asif Ali Zardari promised to fight the militancy destabilising the nuclear-armed country. The international community is worried an economic meltdown in Pakistan, propped up with a $7.6 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund over two years, could fan popular support for al Qaeda and other militant groups. Pakistan is central to U.S. President Barack Obama's plan for South Asia, which includes trying to stabilise Afghanistan where Taliban militants -- many operating from lawless enclaves in northwest Pakistan -- have thrown that effort into doubt.
