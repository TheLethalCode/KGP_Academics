Mutual funds, insurers and non-bank financial institutions eroded their previous day's gains. Power, energy, pharmaceuticals and textile shares continued to slide. Turnover on the twin exchanges also fell substantially from the previous day. Dhaka stocks saw shares worth Tk 4.56 billion changing hands, edging down from Tuesday's Tk 5.42 billion.
