 Naogaon, Apr 16 (bdnews24.com)The government has extended for three more months the detention of former deputy speaker and BNP leader Akhtar Hamid Siddiqui, arrested on Mar 21 for alleged seditious statements, a government official said Thursday. "The home ministry has sent a letter extending his detention order, which will come into effect from April 20," said Naogaon deputy commissioner Md Ahsan Habib Talukder. The letter has already been sent to the supervisor of the district jail, he added. Detective Branch police arrested Siddiqui at his home under the Special Powers Act following a general diary filed by Mahadevpur police officer-in-charge Ilias Fakir. He was given a month's detention, without being charged, under the act. Fakir had quoted Siddiqui as telling him: "This government will fall within the next two months and lakhs of Awami League supporters will die." The OC claimed Siddiqui had made the statement and personally threatened Fakir after inviting him to his residence on Mar. 19. By Mar 29 four cases and two general diaries ranging from physical assault to extortion were filed against the former deputy speaker. bdnews24
