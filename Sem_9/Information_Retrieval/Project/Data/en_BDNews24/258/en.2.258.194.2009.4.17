 Dhaka, April 17 (bdnews24.com)  The national booters will try to do something different from what they had achieved under Brazilian coach Edson Silva Dido when they square off against Nepal Police in Kathmandu on Saturday. It is the lone practice game for the Bangladesh team ahead of the AFC Challenge Cup qualifying round in Dhaka, scheduled for April 26-30. Before leaving Dido said that his only intention to play a match abroad was to boost the players' morale whoever the opponents were. The match will be played at the Kathmandu Police ground instead of Dashrath Stadium which is undergoing some renovation, according to a message from BFF vice-president Badal Roy. Roy, who is accompanying the team, informed that the pitch is particularly hard and the ground staff is trying to soften it. But coach Dido will be more concerned on how his new strike partnership of Enamul Haq and Mithun Chowdhury performs as well as see whether the other players have adopted his coaching methods. The new pairing got the chance to cement their places in the Challenge Cup matches against Cambodia, Myanmar and Macao after regular front men Jahid Hasan Emily and Mohammad Robin both got injured. League champions Nepal Police are not expected to be an easy side as they blanked B. League champions Abahani Limited studded with eight national players 4-0 in the AFC President's Cup in Malaysia in 2008. bd
