 Dhaka, Apr 20 (bdnews24.com)Former communications secretary Iqbal Mahmud has denied approving a proposal on the purchase of a luxury vehicle for communication minister Syed Abul Hossain. "I did not approve the proposal though I was informed of it," Mahmud, now establishment secretary told bdnews24.com Monday. "The file was approved by the former additional secretary of the communication ministry, Muhammad Shafiul Alam, as I was then abroad," he said. Shafiul is now acting secretary of the president's office. Mahmud made the comment as he was asked about a parliamentary standing committee's summons on the car purchase issue. He said he would turn up before the committee to clarify his position. "As a government employee, I am accountable to the higher authority for all my actions." In an advertisement in a national daily on Mar 18, the Roads and Highways Department invited a formal tender for a car to be officially used by the communications minister. The bids were to be opened on Monday, the closing date of tender submission. The parliamentary watchdog discussed the issue on Sunday and asked Mahmud for his clarification. bdnews2
