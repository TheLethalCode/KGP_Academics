He added the contribution to Mujibnagar Government will always be remembered. Hasina said, "The liberation took an institutional shape after Mujibnagar government had been formed on April 17." "The government ran the struggle for nine months and united freedom-loving people from all classes and professions, including political parties, and gained the final victory with the assistance of the allied forces on December 16." She also called on all to work in unison being imbued with the spirit of the day to form a hunger and poverty-free Bangladesh.

Mujibnagar also became the first capital of independent Bangladesh. Independence hero Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was made president, Syed Nazrul Islam vice president, Tajuddin Ahmed prime minister and Muhammad Mansur Ali finance minister in that makeshift government. Later Syed Nazrul Islam became acting president in the absence of Sheikh Mujib, who had been arrested by the Pakistani occupation forces on the night of Mar 25, 1971 and detained in a Pakistan jail. The government led the country's nine-month war of independence from Pakistan that ended with the surrender of the occupation forces on Dec 16. Installation of the government began with a guard of honour led by a contingent of police. Syed Nazrul Islam hoisted the national flag and read out the charter of independence as hundreds of local and foreign journalists watched on. The government launched political and diplomatic offensive, sensitised the international community about the genocide and carried operation to rehabilitate some 10 million refugees who were accommodated by India. bd
