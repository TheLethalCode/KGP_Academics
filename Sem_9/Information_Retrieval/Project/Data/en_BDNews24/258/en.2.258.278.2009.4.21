<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 21 (bdnews24.com) The Indo-Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industry hopes to see Bangladesh's exports to the northeastern Indian states touch $1 billion by 2011. Speaking exclusively to bdnews24.com Tuesday, IBCCI president Abdul Matlub Ahmad said the export basket would now include products like brick, plastic goods, readymade garment, agro-products and frozen foods. Bangladesh exported products worth $1.4 billion in 2007-8 financial year, and goods worth $35.8 million were sold to India, he added. The exports to India mainly are frozen foods, processed agro-products, jute and jute products, tea, chemicals and readymade garment. "We hope to close a deal to supply 40 crore pieces of bricks worth Tk 200 crore with the Tripura state government in the next 10 days," said Ahmad, also the chairman of Nitol-Niloy Group. Bangladesh's exports to India's economically lagging northeastern states are ten times the imports from the Seven Sisters, as the states are called. Ahmed, who led an IBCCI team to Tripura earlier this week, said they had plans to expand Bangladesh's market to other Indian states based on the business model with the northeastern states. He explained why and how business prospects between Bangladesh and the tiny Indian state were very high. "The people of Tripura have a soft corner for Bangladeshis, the cultural ties between us and them are rooted deep," he said. "Many people are basically migrants from Bangladesh." The state had given refuge to Bangladeshis more than twice its population during the independence war in 1971, Ahmad said, quoting Tripura's chief minister Manik Sarkar who he met during a recent trip. Sarkar has his origins in Bangladesh, so do so many otherssuch as the vice chancellor of the top university there. Ahmad says the university has agreed to offer five fellowships to Bangladeshi students. The IBCCI chief, however, pointed out that a lack of infrastructure in that region was a major obstacle to doing business there. The government can let the private sector develop the infrastructure if it cannot do it. "The most discouraging is the lack of a land port as well as poor road communications." Better roads and other facilities in that region can also woo Bangladeshi tourists, contributing to their economy, added the IBCCI president. He said they were launching package tours of 4 days-3 nights in Tripura at Tk 5000 for students and Tk 9500 for businesspeople, which would be announced Wednesday. The trade body has also plans to open a large shopping mall, styled Bangla Bazaar, in Agartala, the capital of Tripura, for exclusively displaying Bangladeshi products. "It would be a joint venture on a five bigha land where at least 100 small enterprises would display Bangladeshi goods," said Ahmad. The IBCCI president added that they planned to open up such outlets in other Indian states, as well.
