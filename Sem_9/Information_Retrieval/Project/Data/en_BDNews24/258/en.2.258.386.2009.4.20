 Dhaka, Apr 20 (bdnews24.com)Citing personal reasons, General Moeen U Ahmed resigned Monday as chairman of National Sports Council amid controversy over a football sponsorship deal. A sports ministry official, speaking at around 3:15pm, told reporters that the resignation letter had reached the ministry half an hour back. An aide to the army chief had earlier confirmed the news to bdnews24.com. Bangladesh Olympic Association CEO retired colonel Waliullah told bdnews24.com that the general had cited personal reasons in his letter of resignation. The general is also head of the national Olympic committee. The state minister for sports, Ahad Ali Sarker, welcomed the general's move. "To strengthen democratic process, the charge for sports should be vested in the political leadership," the state minister told bdnews24.com. The minister said he would thank Moeen for his services. "He took over during a transitional period and tried his best to discharge his duties." The presence of Moeen in the signing on Apr 13 of a Tk 4.5 crore three-year sponsorship deal between Bangladesh Football Federation and Bashundhara Group, headed by Ahmed Akbar Sobhan, better known as Shah Alam, who is facing corruption charges, touched off controversy. Alam was indicted during an anti-corruption campaign launched by the two-year rule of the military-installed government. The campaign, it was widely perceived, was spearheaded by Gen Moeen. Under the Basundhara deal, the BFF would get Tk 1.5 crore a year for the development of football at district levels. The group also announced that it would provide two grounds worth Tk 200 crore for the BFF. The day after the deal was sealed in the army-run Golf Club in Dhaka, largest-selling Bengali daily Prothom Alo ran a cartoon mocking the agreement and referred to the crusade against corruption. bdnew
