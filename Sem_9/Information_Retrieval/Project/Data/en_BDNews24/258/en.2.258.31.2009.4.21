 Dhaka, Apr 21 (bdnews24.com)There will be no respite as Bangladesh bakes in a heat wave for past three days, twinned with power cuts, so intense that mud houses become as hot as ovens. The searing temperatures that started sweeping the country Saturday is likely to continue for a couple more days, senior Meteorology Department official SM Mahmudul Haque told bdnews24.com Tuesday. The high temperatures led to a shortage of drinking water and dehydration and sunstroke, crippling millions in capital Dhaka and in other parts of the country. Many are forced to use stinking and dirty water for washing and bathing. Heat waves always precede the monsoon rains and induce the moisture to come in. The Met office said the "heavy heat wave" sweeping over Khulna division and regions of Rajshahi, Iswardi, and Dhaka, looked likely to continue, with the mercury soaring above 41 degrees Celsius. The heat wave was the impact of a severe dry weather in India's West Bengal, Mahmud said. Meteorologist Sujit Kumar Dev Sharma on Sunday said, "It depends on the situation. Rain will reduce the temperature but dry weather would prevail again." "The sun is nearing to the Tropic of Cancer, which is why the heat feels more scorching," said Sharma. The highest temperature was recorded Tuesday in Jessore at 41.4 degrees, which is also the season's maximum. Met office recorded 36.5 in Dhaka, 38.0 in Ishwardi, 37.5 in Faridpur, 35.5 in Madaripur, 35.6 in Tangail, 36.5 in Tangail, 36.5 in Rajshahi, 34.8 in Chandpur and 32.3 in Kutubdia. The weather forecast said the medium to heavy heat wave over Khulna division and mild wave over Dhaka division was likely to continue. bdnews
