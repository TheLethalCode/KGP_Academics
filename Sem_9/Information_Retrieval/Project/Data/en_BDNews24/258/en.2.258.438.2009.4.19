<TITLE> Coming budget will boost purchasing power: PM </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 19 (bdnews24.com)There will be special initiatives in the next budget to boost people's purchasing power, prime minister Sheikh Hasina said Sunday. "Only lowering will not do; the purchase power of the people will also have to increase," she said. "The coming budget will prioritise the protection of local industries and boosting people's purchasing power." She said the two priorities had been set at a pre-budget meeting with the finance minister AMA Muhith the previous day. She said by lowering the cost of essentials, the government has met its first pledge of her party's the election manifesto. Highlighting that farmers never incurred losses during the previous Awami League government, she said this time as well the farmers will not be harmed by low prices. The government would ensure they get fair prices for their produces, she said. The premier made the remarks when a delegation of Bangladesh Grey and Finished Fabrics Mills and Exporters Association met her at her office. "The government will extend all kind of support to exporters after protecting domestic industries and meeting local demand," she said. She heard the problems of the grey and finished fabrics mills industry and assured the delegation of solutions. "You are contributing to the economy but the sector is neglected," Hasina said. Hasina advised them to seek incentives from the just-announced government package to offset the negative impacts of the global recession. The prime minister said she was wholly against shutting down industrial mills. Her government did not have any plans to shut down the Adamjee jute mills, she said. "[Rather] we want jute-based manufacturing to be housed under private ownership on the vacant spaces of that area." On the electricity crisis she said, "I had talks with the regulatory commission on whether the cost fo licence and licence renewal for captive power plants could be lessened." Earlier in the morning, the comptroller and auditor general Ahmed Ataul Hakim handed over annual reports to the prime minister at her office. She stressed making the parliamentary standing committees more effective to ensure transparency in government's financial records. bdnews2
