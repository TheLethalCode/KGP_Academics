<TEXT>
 JOHANNESBURG, Sun Apr 19, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa's ruling ANC leader Jacob Zuma said on Sunday his party had no plans to change the country's constitution and made a plea for unity at a final campaign rally ahead of this week's election. The ANC is almost certain to win the poll but faces its biggest challenge in the April 22 national and provincial elections since coming to power when apartheid ended in 1994. Zuma told tens of thousands of supporters who packed two sports stadiums in Johannesburg the ruling party had used its parliamentary majority responsibly. "In 15 years that the ANC has been in power, the ANC has never used its electoral mandate to change the constitution and it has no intention of doing so," Zuma said. He made a plea for unity among South Africans and said the ANC will work towards reducing the impact of the global financial crisis on the country and its people. "We will forge partnerships to reduce job losses, and ensure that our economy has a solid foundation for renewed growth once the recovery begins," Zuma said. The ANC has promised to do more to bring economically disadvantaged blacks into the mainstream economy through land reform and affirmative action programmes. But Africa's biggest economy is on the brink of recession, and Zuma will be in a difficult position. Union allies are pushing him to spend more on the poor, while foreign investors crucial for growth fear he will steer the economy to the left. MANDELA BOOST The ANC's campaign was given a boost by Nelson Mandela attending the final rally on Sunday. The rally was held at two adjoining Johannesburg sport stadiums with a combined capacity of over 100,000 people. Former president Mandela, 90, was driven into a packed sports stadium in a golf cart to cheers from the tens of thousands of ANC supporters gathered for the rally to be addressed by party leader Jacob Zuma. A frail-looking Mandela, wearing an ANC shirt, was helped onto the stage by the Zuma and said in a pre-recorded message broadcast at the stadiums an ANC victory had to be used to stamp out poverty. "As we try to secure a decisive victory in the upcoming elections we must remember it is to eradicate poverty and ensure a better life for all," Mandela said in the message. The elder statesman, who led his country out of apartheid and fostered reconciliation, has steered clear of politics and the power struggles that have hurt the ANC over the past few years. His attendance at the rally alongside Zuma is bound to boost the ANC ahead of the election in which analysts expect the ruling party to lose its two-thirds parliamentary majority as it faces criticism over its performance on poverty, crime and AIDS. The new breakaway Congress of the People (COPE) party, formed by ANC dissidents, and a revitalised official opposition Democratic Alliance, hope to tap into frustrations with ANC graft scandals. State prosecutors have given the ANC a boost by dropping graft charges against Zuma, whom the new parliament is certain to elect president. Zuma has said the graft case was part of a political campaign to undermine
