<TITLE> Lyon coaching a problem, says Benzema </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PARIS, April 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news from Ligue 1 ahead of this weekend's matches: Olympique Lyon coach Claude Puel constantly changing his starting line-up was proving to be a problem, striker Karim Benzema has said before the seven-times French champions visit fellow title contenders Girondins Bordeaux on Sunday (1900 GMT). "I am not the coach but it's true that with all those changes we sometimes find it difficult to get our bearings," France forward Benzema told sports daily L'Equipe on Friday. Puel's team had held the lead for seven months until a 2-2 home draw with Monaco last weekend knocked them down to second place, one point behind new leaders Olympique Marseille and one point ahead of third-placed Bordeaux. "It would be a catastrophe," Benzema said, of the prospect of Lyon not winning an eighth consecutive title. "But I think Bordeaux have nothing we don't have. We must go there to win." France holding midfielder Jeremy Toulalan, who missed Lyon's match at Monaco because of a knee problem, was back in training on Friday and should play against Bordeaux. Olympique Marseille could be without Taye Taiwo when they visit mid-table Lorient on Sunday (1500 GMT). The Nigeria defender, who was substituted with a groin strain in Thursday's 2-1 UEFA Cup defeat by Shakhtar Donetsk, has to rest for two days, the club said on its website (www.om.net). Paris St Germain will probably miss Sammy Traore when they host bottom club Le Havre on Sunday (1500 GMT). The towering central defender was substituted in Thursday's 3-0 UEFA Cup defeat by Dynamo Kiev because of a recurrent hip problem. Strugglers Nantes will have to make do without Ivan Klasnic when they welcome Nice on Saturday (1700 GMT) after the Croatia striker missed training this week because of a groin injury. Nice will miss holding defender Cyril Rool, who will be suspended after collecting three yellow cards over the last 10 matches. The notoriously rough Rool has picked a total 12 yellow cards and one red in various competitions this season. Fifth-placed Lille will welcome back influential midfielder Yohan Cabaye from a three-match suspension when they visit once-great St Etienne on Saturday (1900 GMT)
