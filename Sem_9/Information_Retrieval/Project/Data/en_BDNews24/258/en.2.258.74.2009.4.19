<TITLE> World lags on poverty goals, food security key: G8 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CISON DI VALMARINO, Italy, Sun Apr 19, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Poor progress in tackling poverty and problems in balancing supply and demand mean fears about how to feed the developing world will persist, a draft G8 farm ministers' paper said on Sunday. The world is struggling to meet a pledge to bring millions out of hunger, a problem worsened by the financial crisis, it said, while price volatility and the tenuous balance between food supply and demand mean fears about global security will continue. Draft conclusions from the first meeting of agriculture ministers from G8 and G5 countries betrayed concerns that the world was lagging on commitments to tackle poverty and hunger, and hampered by its inability to guarantee food supply. "The Millenium Declaration aimed to halve the proportion of the world population facing poverty and undernourishment by the year 2015," the draft declaration from the G8 ministers said.

"It will refer to humanitarian needs and stock management with a view towards limiting price volatility," he said. The declaration will also refer, vaguely, to other sensitive issues debated: "land-grabbing", or investments by food importer countries in arable land in other countries, as well as the roles of biotechnology and biofuels. A growing trend is for governments to invest in farm projects beyond their borders. Countries in the arid Gulf Arab region have blazed the trail in this, hoping to achieve greater food security and also spend less on major grain purchases. The declaration will mention "public and private investment in sustainable agriculture" and the "importance of innovative technologies", the draft showed, and to say that renewable energies should be increased in a sustainable ma
