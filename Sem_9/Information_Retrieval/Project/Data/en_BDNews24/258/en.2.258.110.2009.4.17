<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 17 (bdnews24.com)The market shrugged off the losses over the past week, riding mainly on banks after a bearish trend that lasted for weeks. The hike in banks caused Dhaka stocks to pass the last week upbeat but profit-taking on the closing day made the premier bourse end almost flat. The honours of top gainers were dominated by banks led by IFIC Bank . Uttara Bank, Trust Bank, AB Bank and Eastern Bank provided the backbone for the rally. The week saw four trading days as Apr 14 was a national holiday. Total turnover for the week was Tk 16 .10 billion while the daily average turnover recorded a 5.42 percent increase from the previous week to Tk 4.25 billion. The opening day's, that is Apr 12, trading saw share prices of banks sky-rocket, rising almost eight percent on average, which led the indices of Dhaka Stock Exchange to gain significantly after weeks. The benchmark DGEN or general index was at 2408.67 on the opening day and gained 142.07 points or 5.90 percent to 2550.74 on the closing day. The DSI or all share price index also soared 113.24 points or 5.66 percent from the opening day to finish at 2115.12 on Thursday. Market observers said the rise in banks was the outcome of its high profit margins. "Large margins in [banks'] operating income probably fuelled the demand for banks," Bashir Ahmed, an investment consultant for brokerage firm Stocks & Bonds, told bdnews24com. Brokerage firm officials, however, said institutional investors made the most buying on Sunday. Mutual funds, insurance and non-bank financial institutions joined the rally with banks on the following day which helped the bourse to maintain an upward trend. Markets were closed on Tuesday, a public holiday for Bangla New Year's Day. Wednesday's market heated up as retail investors joined the buying spree. The day saw Dhaka stock's benchmark general index end 72 points higher. Power, energy and pharmaceutical scrips also witnessed rises on buying pressure. Market operators said investors gained confidence due to the ongoing hike of banks, which accounted for 52 percent of the market capitalisation. "It seems [retail] investors have also regained confidence from the recent rise of banks," Dhaka Stock Exchange's senior vice-president Saiful Islam told bdnews24.com on Wednesday. He, however, anticipated profit-taking 'very soon', which turned out to be the case the next day. Markets remained nearly flat on Thursday as investors opted to reap profits from the week's gains, reflecting edginess, according to experts. "[The profit-taking ] is a sign of nervousness," former DSE chief executive Salahuddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com. Investors with low confidence in the markets went for profits from banks after just three days of gains, he said. "The price correction was just starting," added Ahmed, a professor of finance at the University of Dhaka. Market capitalisation witnessed a 4.4 percent increase to Tk 1032.66 billion on the closing day from Tk 989.10 billion on Sunday. Beximco topped the week's turnover board with shares worth Tk 1.29 billion traded, or 8.07 percent of the week's total turnover. Summit Power, AB Bank, ACI Ltd and Titas Gas were the other turnover leaders. Reports of new SEC chief The post of the Securities and Exchange Commission chairman fell vacant after Faruq Ahmad Siddiqi retired on March 19 as the head of the market watchdog. Investment Corporation of Bangladesh (ICB) managing director Ziaul Haque Khondker voluntarily retired Wednesday and rumours were swirling that he might helm the regulatory body. Unconfirmed reports say the government would announce Khondoker's appointment to the top job in "two or three days". It has been learnt that the appointment has been approved by offices of the prime minister and the president.
