<TITLE> From Our Blog: Bailout to industries and the greater question of industrialisation </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 From Our Blog Mahmud ur Rahman Choudhury On 12 April, the PM while speaking to officials of the industries ministry instructed them to reopen all shut-down state-owned mills and convert them into profit making enterprises. Shortly thereafter, on 19 April, the AL government unveiled a bailout package for the entire economy to the tune of Tk. 3, 424 crorer. No doubt the PM and her government mean well but well-meaning intentions are just not enough to get industrialization going in Bangladesh; one has to understand the reasons behind the rise and fall of industries. When Bangladesh became independent, mills and factories could be counted on the fingers of ones hands and all of these were owned by Pakistani industrialists, who fled the country after the Liberation War, forcing the Bangladeshi government to nationalize them. Bangladesh had neither the expertise nor the experience to run industries and so these nationalized industries dissolved into inefficiency and corruption and were shut down within a few years. One remarkable thing though, about these pre-liberation era industries were that they were all based on resources and raw materials that agriculture provided such as jute, tea, tobacco, sugar etc. So, on the one hand these industries prompted diversification of agriculture into both "cash" and cereal crops and on the other hand made industries sustainable because raw materials were growing from the earth and were virtually limitless. Returns were slow in coming but finally value additions were tremendous  both to agriculture and to industries  nothing needed to be imported and everything could be exported after satisfying domestic demands. This was import substitution and value-addition at its best. That the people of Bangladesh did not benefit from all these could be laid at the doors of exploitative policies followed by the Pakistanis, who took away all the returns. That agriculture and its related activities provided us with prosperity, lies rooted in our economic history. Consider, for example the fact that already by late 16th century, land fertility, rice cultivation and population density, all grew to such an extent that south & east Bengal were producing surplus grain for exports. From two principal seaports, Chittagong in the east & Satgaon in the west, rice was exported throughout the Indian Ocean region. The most impressive evidence in this regard comes from Francois Pyrard. After spending the spring of 1607 in Chittagong, the Frenchman wrote: "There is such a quantity of rice that besides supplying the whole country, it is exported to all parts of India. as to Sumatra, the Moluccas and all the islands of Sunda, to all of which lands Bengal is the very nursing mother, who supplies them their entire subsistence and food. Thus one sees on arriving there, everyday an infinite number of vessels from all parts of India for these provisions". Even earlier, Wang Ta-yuan, a Chinese merchant who visited the delta in 1349-50, observed that the Bengalis: "owe all their tranquility and prosperity to themselves, for its source lies in their devotion to agriculture, whereby a land originally covered with jungle has been reclaimed by their unremitting toil in tilling and planting The riches and integrity of its people surpass, perhaps those of Ch'iu-chiang (Palembang - Indonesia) and equal those of Chao-wa (Java)". Defying so many centuries of history, in the 1980s the buzzword in Bangladesh was industrialization and the form it took was the half-processing sweat-shops of garments. All raw materials, including packing cartons and threads were imported, quickly sewed into clothing and exported  returns and turn-around times were quick and so the government encouraged it. Gradually back-ward linkages were developed to produce threads, accessories and some fabrics but still all raw materials had to be imported. A whole host of service industries developed around these "garments" such as transportations, financial and banking enterprises, insurances, shipping and clearing agents etc. The government imposed taxes and dozens of licensing fees on all of these activities and turned a blind eye to corruption which these activities engendered. Within just about 2 decades the whole thing had turned into a regime of loot and rapine of both public and private wealth. This was not import substitution, value-addition or even industrialization in any real sense because it gave rise to a system of exploitation as debilitating as any in the world. The greatest damage it did was to our agriculture and agriculture based industries, destroying them to such an extent that the word "cash crop" ceased to exist in anyone's lexicon, including those of the farmers. Huge masses of people engaged in producing raw materials for industries based on agriculture were driven into unemployment and poverty  the garment industries today claim credit to providing employment to 30 or 40 lakh people but who is going to claim the discredit of driving millions into starvation? So, if the PM and the AL government which she heads, means to achieve industrialization, which will benefit the "people" in any meaningful way, the PM and her government have to go back to the basics  to a system which will allow agriculture and industries to feed on each other benefiting and sustaining both. We must have industries based on resources and raw materials which our land and our people can produce; only then can we have import-substitutions and value-additions which will benefit all of us as opposed to benefiting a small coterie of so called "industrialists".
