 Dhaka, Apr 21 (bdnews24.com)Tax payers will be able to submit their returns online this year as the government moves to set up a "totally digitalised" revenue system, the finance minister said Tuesday. "It will make the process of paying tax easier and curb corruption," said AMA Muhith after a meeting with National Board of Revenue officials in the capital. "Online tax returns will mean a tax payer will not need a lawyer," he said. Corporate tax payers may still need the help of experts, he added. "We'll transform the entire NBR administration into a totally digital one, helping to substantially reduce corruption." Muhith said he did not see much need for institutional reform. "Legislative reform should be enough to extract desired revenue." The minister mentioned WTO trade rules in recent years causing revenues from duty and VAT to fall for all countries. This may be better for the people's pockets, said Muhith. "But the government needs to depend more on income tax for its revenue." Despite the ongoing global recession, he was optimistic about reaching revenue targets. Taxmen have collected Tk 35,080 crore in the first three quarters of the current fiscal year, with the target for the year set at Tk 54,500 crore, said the minister. Muhith said the last quarter of the year usually saw a greater rate of revenue collection. He said NBR's target would be set at over Tk 60,000 crore for FY 2009-10. The ongoing global downturn has begun to cast a shadow on Bangladesh's economy, said Muhith. "But we are not in such a bad position," he added. He renewed his pledge to take all necessary measures to protect the economy from serious losses. bdne
