 JOHANNESBURG, Apr 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - ANC leader Jacob Zuma, boosted by the support of Nelson Mandela at a final election rally, dismissed accusations his ruling party planned to change South Africa's constitution and appealed for national unity. The ANC is almost certain to win the national and provincial elections on April 22 but faces its biggest challenge since coming to power when apartheid ended in 1994. Zuma told tens of thousands of supporters who packed two sports stadiums in Johannesburg that the ruling party had used its parliamentary majority responsibly. "In 15 years that the ANC has been in power, the ANC has never used its electoral mandate to change the constitution and it has no intention of doing so," he said. The official opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) and F.W. de Klerk, South Africa's last white president, have said the ANC will abuse its power and planned to change the constitution. Their criticism centres on cabinet's approval of a draft bill that would give the government wide powers to intervene at local authority level. Mandela, 90, endorsed the ANC in a pre-recorded message after entering the stadium in a golf cart. The former president, who led South Africa out of apartheid and fostered reconciliation, has steered clear of politics and the power struggles that have hurt the ANC over recent years. Looking frail and wearing an ANC shirt, Mandela was helped on to the stage by Zuma. "As we try to secure a decisive victory in the upcoming elections, we must remember it is to eradicate poverty and ensure a better life for all," Mandela said. His attendance at the rally alongside Zuma is bound to boost the ANC, although analysts expect the ruling party to lose its two-thirds parliamentary majority at the election after criticism over its performance on poverty, crime and AIDS. Appealing for unity among South Africans, Zuma said the ANC would work towards reducing the impact of the global financial crisis on the country and its people. "We will forge partnerships to reduce job losses, and ensure that our economy has a solid foundation for renewed growth once the recovery begins," he said. The rally was held at two adjoining Johannesburg sports stadiums with a combined capacity of more than 100,000. Supporters, waving flags and wearing the black, green and yellow ANC colours, packed the stadiums and cheered their leader. "I've been voting for the ANC since 1994. I'm not about to stop. ANC for life," said Siphiwe Kunene. MANDELA SUPPORT The ANC has promised to do more to bring economically disadvantaged blacks into the mainstream economy through land reform and affirmative action programmes. But the economy, Africa's biggest, is on the brink of recession, and Zuma is in a difficult position. Union allies are pushing him to spend more on the poor while foreign investors crucial for growth fear he will steer the economy to the left. The new breakaway Congress of the People (COPE) party, formed by ANC dissidents, and a revitalised DA hope to tap into frustrations with ANC graft scandals. The DA, COPE and the second biggest opposition party, the Inkatha Freedom Party, criticised corruption involving ANC officials at closing campaign rallies on Sunday. "The ruling party has over the past few years demonstrated its defiance of the constitution and disdain for the rule of law. Corruption, cronyism and nepotism have become the order of the day," COPE deputy president Mbhazima Shilowa told a rally. State prosecutors have given the ANC a boost by dropping graft charges against Zuma, who is certain to be elected by the new parliament. Zuma has said the graft case was part of a political campaign to undermine him
