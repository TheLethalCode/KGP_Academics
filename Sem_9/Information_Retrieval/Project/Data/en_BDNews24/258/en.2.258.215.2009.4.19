 Dhaka, April 19 (bdnews24.com)  The country was sweltering under a heat wave Sunday, as the mercury climbed above 41 degrees Celcius in the southwest and city dwellers suffered frequent power cuts to add to the soaring heat. The met office said the "heavy heat wave", sweeping over Khulna division and regions of Rajshahi, Iswardi, Bogra and Dhaka, looked likely to continue. Meteorologist Sujit Kumar Dev Sharma told bdnews24.com, "It depends on the situation. Rain will reduce the temperature but dry weather would raise it again." The highest temperature was recorded in Jessore at 41.4 degrees. It registered 37.3 degrees in Dhaka, with a brief spell of rain bringing small respite in the afternoon. "The sun is nearing to the Tropic of Cancer, which is why the heat feels more scorching," said Sharma. The met office, in its forecast for the 24 hours from 6pm Sunday, said the weather was likely to remain mainly dry over most of the country. There are chances of rain or thunder showers accompanied by temporary gusty, squally wind at one or two places over Rajshahi, Chittagong and Sylhet divisions, it said. Day temperatures will remain unchanged, said the forecast. Among the highest temperatures recorded Sunday were: Tangail 36.7, Faridpur 39.1, Madaripur 36.2, Chandpur 35.5, Rajshahi 40.7, Iswardi 39.6, Bogra 36.7, Khulna 38.6, Mongla 38, Satkhira 39 and Chuadanga 40.7 degrees.
