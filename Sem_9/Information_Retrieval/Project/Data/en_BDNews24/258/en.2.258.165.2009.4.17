 Chittagong, Apr 17 (bdnews24.com)Local authorities started evacuating people from risky areas along the resort district Cox's Bazar coastline as cyclonic storm 'Bijli' was zeroing in on the shore. Some 5,000 people were moved to shelter centres and other safe places by 6:30pm, as volunteers were asking people over loudspeakers to leave coastal areas. Chittagong Port Authority secretary Syed Farhad Uddin said they at an emergency meeting decided to suspend all activities of the port after the Meteorology Department asked them to raise danger signal 7. It also asked fishing boats to rush back to shore. The met department has forecast that the storm was likely to weaken gradually and move in a northeasterly direction and may cross Chittagong-Cox's Bazar coast by midnight. Separate control rooms were opened at Chittagong City Corporation, district and Upazila headquarters to oversee the cyclone preparedness. Chittagong deputy commissioner Fariduddin Ahmed said some 6,000 volunteers were working in the district and some 283 medical teams formed. They marked out seven most risky Upazilas across the coast and dry foods and essential medicines have been supplied to all the upazilas. Coastal districts have been experiencing medium to heavy rain since Thursday night, local officials said. The Chittagong City Corporation has opened up all the coastal schools, ward offices and shelter centres to accommodate evacuees. bdnews24.co
