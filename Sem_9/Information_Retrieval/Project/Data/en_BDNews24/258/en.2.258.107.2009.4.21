The student front Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal will also hold a rally at the central party office at Naya Paltan Tuesday afternoon, party deputy publication secretary Muhiuddin Khan Mohan told bdnews24.com. Other associate organisations were also launching protest programmes, he said. Khaleda's lawyer Mahbubuddin Khokan told bdnews24.com BNP was preparing to petition the High Court on reviewing the notice. "The notice has no legal basis," he said.
