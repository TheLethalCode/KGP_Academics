 Dhaka, Apr 18 (bdnews24.com)The BNP will only accept a court verdict on the fate of party chief Khaleda Zia's cantonment residence, a senior BNP leader said Saturday. "We will accept whatever verdict the court gives on the cabinet decision to cancel the lease of the cantonment house," said BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, addressing a protest rally in front of the party central office at Naya Paltan in the city. "Say 'yes' to the court verdict as we are ready to do so," he said, directing his comments to the government. "The country is beset with limitless problems like power and water crises, lack of employment, low foreign investment and return of overseas workers because of global recession," he said. "But the government is up in arms about the cantonment house. Well, we will leave the issue to be decided by the court" he said BNP has been protesting since the cabinet's April 8 decision to cancel Khaleda's lease on the cantonment house, given after her husband, president Zia Rahman, was killed in a military coup. "The house was leased out to the widow and children of 'Shaheed' Zia under the-then presidential government system." "The cabinet decision to cancel the lease was wrong and the government should approach the court to settle the issue," said Delwar. "Don't threaten us. The government will have to bear the consequences if it tries to forcibly oust the party chief from her house," he warned. On the government's first 100 days in power, he said, "We see no big successes but a big failure in not releasing the probe report on the BDR tragedy in due time." "Rather they are trying to influence the report of the probe committee," claimed Delwar. bdn
