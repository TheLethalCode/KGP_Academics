 Dhaka, Apr 17 (bdnews24.com)  The trial of crimes committed in the 1971 war of independence from Pakistan starts Monday and may end by this Victory Day, the law minister said Friday. "We will appoint investigating agencies and prosecutors early next week or by Monday," Shafiq Ahmed told reporters after inaugurating children's organisation Khelaghar's National Conference-2009 at the Shaheed Minar. These appointments will mark the start of the trial of war crimes, he added "We hope to complete the trial of war crimes soon once it starts. It may be complete within next Victory Day (Dec 16, 1971 when Pakistan army surrendered)." The trial of crime against humanity is going to take place under International Tribunal Act-1973 in line with the electoral pledge of the ruling Awami League and an unanimous decision in parliament, the minister said. An advisor to Khelaghar, he urged the new generation in his brief speech to be good citizens by knowing the history of independence war. He also called upon their guardians and teachers to teach the right history. "Our students have to be taught who fought for freedom, introduction of Bangabandhu (independence hero Sheikh Mujibur Rahman)-led freedom fighters and opponents of liberation war." He earlier administered oaths to participants who expressed solidarity with the demand for war crimes trial. Educationist Sardar Fazlul Karim was scheduled to open the ceremony but he was indisposed. His statement for the ceremony was read out, though. b
