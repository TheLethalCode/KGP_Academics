 BERLIN, April 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Top Hertha Berlin striker Andriy Voronin, on loan from Liverpool, said on Friday he expected to return to England at the end of the season. Voronin would like to stay on in Berlin after scoring 11 goals in the Bundesliga this season, which briefly steered Hertha to the top of the table, but the Ukrainian said the two clubs could not agree a deal. "On the matter of my contract there has been no movement in Berlin," he told Bild newspaper. "Liverpool made a good offer which Hertha did not accept. It is a shame that it may not go through." "I have already ordered the boxes and am moving out of the apartment within a month and a half." The 29-year-old is adored by fans in Berlin but Hertha has insisted it could only afford to buy him from Liverpool if they clinch a Champions League spot to boost their revenues next season. Hertha are on 49 points in fourth place, five points behind leaders VfL Wolfsburg with seven matches left. The top two teams qualify directly for the top European club competition while the third-placed team plays qualification matches. Hertha will be missing Voronin for three of those league games after the striker kicked an opponent and then kicked the ball into his body before being sent off in the final minute in Hertha's 2-0 defeat by Hanover 96 last Saturday
