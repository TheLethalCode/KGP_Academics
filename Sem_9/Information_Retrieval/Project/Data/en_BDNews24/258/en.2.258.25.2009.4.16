<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 16 (bdnews24.com)The government has refused to give in to pressure from Upazila Parishad chairmen to revoke the latest version of Upazila Parishad law but says it may be fine tuned if needed. Local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam told reporters Thursday at his office that chances were that parliament might change the law if any problem cropped up once the law was implemented. His remarks came a day after Upazila chairmen and vice chairmen threatened to declare local MPs "unwanted" unless the local councils' authority was not restored in line with the 2008 ordinance passed by the caretaker government. The chairmen on Wednesday demanded cancellation of the much-debated Upazila Parishad Act 2009, passed by parliament on Apr 6, that restored powers of MPs over the councils. It also made it mandatory for chairmen to accept MP recommendations as ex-officio advisers to the country's 481 local government bodies. "Some quarters, including a number of media outlets, are instigating (Upazila chairmen) so that the law is not implemented. Too much instigation may bring dire consequences because the MPs have lots of power. They can amend the law if they wish. If necessary they can repeal the entire law," he warned. He urged the Upazila chairmen to have patience and reminded them that law had been passed unanimously in parliament. The government is preparing to execute the law and offices for Upazila chairmen, manpower and cars for Upazila Parishad have been recruited, he added. Asked how the government would respond to the chairmen's threat, the minister said the government was not thinking of anything at the moment because it wanted to work with the Upazila chairmen. The law gives no-one supreme authority and the MPs are only advisors. "I don't think they will give uncalled for advice. They can give make suggestions as people's representatives, if necessary. It is up to the chairman whether to take the advice or not," he said. The latest changes to the law make chairmen executive chiefs of the Upazila Parishad and the Upazila Nirbahi officers secretary. But the caretaker government in its ordinance made UNOs executive chiefs, he pointed out. Ashraful said the Upazila Parishad law was passed by the previous Awami League government, but it was not implemented. It would not be fair to pass a new law defying parliament when one was already in place. "I think all problems will be resolved once the Upazila chairmen start working," the minister observed. b
