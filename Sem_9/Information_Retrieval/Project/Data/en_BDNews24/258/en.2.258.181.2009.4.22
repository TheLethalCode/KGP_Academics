 UNITED NATIONS, Apr 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - North Korea on Tuesday dismissed UN Security Council efforts to prepare a list of North Korean firms to be blacklisted after Pyongyang's widely criticized rocket launch earlier this month. North Korea's Deputy UN Ambassador Pak Tok Hun said his country was ignoring a Security Council statement that condemned the long-range rocket launch and demanded tougher enforcement of sanctions imposed after Pyongyang's nuclear test in October 2006. "We have already made ourselves clear," he told reporters outside a closed-door meeting of the Security Council sanctions committee on North Korea. "We don't recognize that statement, because it runs against ... international laws," he said. "We have the rights, as I told you, the rights to make peaceful use of outer space." The United States, Japan and South Korea have accused Pyongyang of launching a ballistic missile in violation of Security Council Resolution 1718 of October 2006 that forbids North Korea from firing such missiles. The North says it launched a satellite and was not in breach of the resolution. After the Security Council's statement this month, Pyongyang announced it would boycott six-nation nuclear disarmament talks, restart a plant that makes bomb-grade plutonium and threatened war with South Korea if it joins a U.S. initiative to halt the proliferation of illicit weapons. Even though Resolution 1718 imposed financial sanctions, banned arms sales and imposed a limited trade embargo on North Korea, the measures were largely ignored once Pyongyang returned to aid-for-disarmament talks with the United States, China, Russia, Japan and South Korea in 2006. BLACKLIST Until the April 5 rocket launch, the North Korea sanctions committee had not met for two years. The council statement demanded that the committee reconvene and draw up a list of firms known to be aiding North Korea's nuclear and missile programs by April 24. Turkey's UN Ambassador Baki Ilkin, who chairs the committee, said he was "hopeful" it would meet the deadline. So far, only the United States and Japan have proposed lists of North Korean companies to be placed on a UN blacklist, diplomats on the committee said. The US list, they said, contains 11 companies it believes are linked to the North Korean military, while Japan's list has the same 11 firms and three more not on the US list. Several diplomats complained that Russia was slowing down work on the list of designated firms. They said the Russian delegation told the committee that several Russian government agencies needed time to assess the Japanese and US lists. China, the nearest North Korea has to a major ally, and Russia say that they are not convinced North Korea violated 1718. Some analysts believe the push to enforce the sanctions against North Korea will be largely symbolic and that enforcement of the measures will depend largely on China
