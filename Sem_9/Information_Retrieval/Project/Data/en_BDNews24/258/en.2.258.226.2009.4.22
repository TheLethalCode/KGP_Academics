<TEXT>
 KARACHI, April 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan captain Younis Khan has appealed to the International Cricket Council (ICC) to review its decision to move 2011 World Cup matches out of Pakistan. Younis told the Geo Super sports channel in Dubai that he and his players were devastated by the decision to switch the games away from Pakistan due to security concerns. "I can only appeal to the ICC to rethink their decision because it will put back Pakistan cricket a lot," Younis told reporters during preparations for the five-match one-day series against Australia in Dubai which starts on Wednesday. The 2011 World Cup will take place in India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh
