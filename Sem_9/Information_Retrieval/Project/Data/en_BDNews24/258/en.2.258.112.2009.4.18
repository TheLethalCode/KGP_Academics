 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Apr 18 (bdnews24.com) - The government is going to introduce a revised storm warning system by June, to synchronise maritime and river port signals, a food and disaster ministry official said Saturday. The cabinet division has already approved the revised signal system, Md Sultan Ul Islam Chowdhury, deputy secretary at the minister of disaster management, told bdnews24.com. The new signal system was also one of the last proposals to be approved by the interim cabinet, under the past caretaker government, before the December general elections last year. "It will not be possible to introduce the system on Apr 30 as was originally scheduled," said Sultan. "But it will be launched by June through a countrywide training and awareness programme," said Sultan. The system will update and harmonise the storm signals for both maritime and river ports, he said. Whereas now river ports have signals one to four, and sea ports have a separate one to ten system, both will be brought under the same 1-10 scale. Successive governments had considered revising the warning system for over a decade and a half, but a proposal was finally made in 2007 by a committee headed by disaster expert Prof Jamilur Reza Chowdhury. "I welcome the government's efforts to introduce the new system as quickly as possible, to save lives before the next storm season starting in September," said Chowdhury. According to the proposed new system, there will be eight warning signals for the maritime ports and six for river ports, on an overlapping 1-10 scale, said Md Shah Alam, deputy director of the Meteorological Department. Of the signals, 5 and 7 will be omitted, with maritime ports having recourse to signals 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 10, while river ports will accordingly hoist 3, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 10 on the same scale ranging from cautionary to great danger. Shah Alam said the Disaster Management Bureau would work to train officials and raise public awareness before launching the new signals. The Bureau's director general, Md Farhad Uddin, stressed: "Just changing the signal system is not enough to save lives and properties." "The public must understand the changes and the proper infrastructural support must be put in place." bd
