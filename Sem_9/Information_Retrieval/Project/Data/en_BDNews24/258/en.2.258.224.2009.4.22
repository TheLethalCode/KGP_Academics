 Dhaka, Apr 21 (bdnews24.com)Police picked up two members Bangladesh Chhatra League on Tuesday, "following directions", they said. The arrestees are Mostafa Kamal and Mahmudul Hasan, both Dhaka University students, said sub-inspector Abdul Malek of Shahbagh Police Station. The arrests made in the afternoon from the campus triggered a mild protest among BCL supporters. A number of them gathered in front of the vice-chancellor's residence. Malek said they arrested the two in compliance with instructions of "higher authorities". He did not say who the authorities were. Witnesses said a third BCL man was also picked, but Malek denied this. Kamal beat up two fellow Chhatra Leaguers few days ago, a BCL insider said. The pro-Awami League student front has been heavily condemned for campus violence in past months that has forced temporarily closures of a number of universities and colleges countrywide since the new government came to power in January. Prime minister and AL chief Sheikh Hasina withdrew as BCL's organisational head earlier this month in the wake of mounting violence, seen as a move to sever AL's and Hasina's ties with the unruly student body. The party also issued a stern warning, saying law enforcers had been instructed to take the strongest action against violence and extortion by student leaders and activists. On Apr. 13, Rapid Action Battalion arrested two members of the BCL central committee for "disrupting educational activities at Dhaka University". bd
