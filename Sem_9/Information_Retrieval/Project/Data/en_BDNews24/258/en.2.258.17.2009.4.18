 Dhaka, Apr 18 (bdnews24.com)  India has warned Bangladesh's political leadership, including prime minister Sheikh Hasina, of a possible assassination plot, an Indian newspaper reported Saturday. The Indian Express said foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon had informed Dhaka of the threat during a recent visit. Menon arrived in the capital on an "unscheduled visit" on Apr 12. Bangladesh foreign ministry officials had said it was the first time an Indian foreign secretary had arrived without prior announcement at such short notice. Indian officials in Dhaka had played down the 'unnanounced' element, saying the trip was just "part of ongoing dialogue between friends, between neighbours". The Express on Saturday, meanwhile, quoting unnamed sources said Menon during the visit exchanged notes during the visit with his Bangladesh counterpart on the activities of radical groups that were suspected to have played a role in the recent BDR massacre.

"[T]here was specific intelligence on a plot to target the new Sheikh Hasina government in those conversations intercepted by Indian intelligence agencies. That prompted India to go ahead and warn the Bangladesh top brass of the threat," it said. Dhaka and New Delhi have an agreement to swap anti-terror intelligence, said the Express. It also commented that radical and terror groups in Bangladesh were under pressure since the Awami League government came to power in January, pledging to crack down on terror elements. "New Delhi fears the BDR plot was one of the ways to destabilise the newly elected government ... This is what is believed to have triggered these radical groups to plan an assassination," the newspaper said, echoing previous Indian media reports that February's BDR mutiny in Dhaka had nilitant links. Similar warning before An Indian television network last December reported that Islamist militants were planning to assassinate Awami League president Sheikh Hasina, before she came to power in January. CNN-IBN, just days ahead of the Dec 29 general election, said the former prime minister had been warned by Indian intelligence agencies that a six-member suicide squad of the banned Harkat-ul-Jihad-e-Islami Bangladesh was planning an attempt on her life. Indian high commission spokesperson Deepak Mittal said at the time he was not aware of the warning
