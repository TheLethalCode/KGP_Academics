<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 20 (bdnews24.com)Finance minister AMA Muhith has said the textile sector may still get an incentives boost after it was "overlooked" in the support package. Local textile producers, which supports the country's biggest export earnergarmentsalready enjoy a five percent cash incentive. AMA Muhith on Sunday rolled out a Tk 3,424 crore support package for the last quarter of the current fiscal year to shield farming, power and export sectors from the effects of the global slowdown. Though it raised incentive rates for some export sectors, namely jute, leather and frozen fish, it did not raise them for textiles. Muhith said Monday he "forgot" to include the vital sector. "I forgot include support to the textile sector. We had everything ready. But they were overlooked at the last moment," he said. "After the announcement of the package, reactions from different quarters have come in," he said. The minister said he welcomed the comment of the FBCCI president, who said "you cannot please all the people all the time". "My package might have not satisfied all, but the door is not closed," said Muhith. Muhith said the government would consider extending further support to those "really affected" by the recession. Asked whether the incentives in the textile sector would be increased in the current package or in the next budget, he said the working group would decide on it. Whether the readymade garment sector will get financial support in the face of the recession, the minister said support would be provided if the sector's growth sees a slowdown. There is currently no cash incentive for garments exporters. "I said Sunday that the growth of the readymade garment sector is still increasing." "The package is a process and we'll try to extend support for all sectors affected by the recession," Muhith said. Muhith said Sunday the government had divided its recession package into two parts, an immediate allocation for the remainder of the current year and one for 2009-10. Agriculture received the bear's share of the funds, with direct subsidies to the sector jumping to Tk 5,785 crore from Tk 4,285 and an extra Tk 500 crore under recapitalisation of farm loans. The rest will go to increase subsidies in power and raise the rate of cash incentives for recession-hit exporters in the remaining few months of FY 2008-09. Muhith also laid out an extensive policy support plan for exporters, manufacturers, investors and the labour market. He was speaking to reporters Monday at his ministry after meeting with a delegation of the Bangladesh Football Federation. bdnews24.co
