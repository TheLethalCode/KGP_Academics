<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 17 (bdnews24.com)Authorities shut Chittagong sea and air ports, evacuated thousands of people from coastline and put emergency services stand by Friday as the season's first cyclonic storm "Bijli" lashed shorelines. Roaring in from the Bay of Bengal, it triggered high waves and a tidal surge which may reach up to three metres above the normal tide. About 10,000 people have been evacuated to shelters in Cox's Bazar, as the storm battered many thatched houses and uprooted trees, local residents said. Heavy rain swept Cox's Bazar town, and power supplies were disrupted, according to Reuters news agency. The storm also swept over several offshore islands, and many fishing boats may have been caught in the rough seas while returning to shore, Cox's Bazar officials told reporters, although no death or injury has been reported so far. The met officials citing coastal observations and radar imageries said the storm moved northeastwards further and started crossing Chittagong-Cox's Bazar coast by 7:30pm. It may take another 4-6 hours to complete crossing the coast. It is likely to move in a northeasterly direction and weaken gradually by giving precipitation. Authorities had earlier raised danger signal 7 for busy Chittagong port, asked fishing boats to rush back to shore and put Red Crescent volunteers and law-enforcers on alert for any emergency, including a possible tidal surge, as the storm was forecast to hit the Chittagong-Cox's Bazar coastline by midnight. Cox's Bazaar and Mongla ports were asked to keep hoisted danger signal 6 and 5, respectively, the Meteorological Department said in a special bulletin. Storms are graded with signals ranging from 1 to 10, and authorities start major preparations when the signal is raised to five or beyond. Its peripheral gusty winds has already been experienced in the coastal districts of Cox's Bazar, Noakhali, Feni, Laxmipur and Bhola Coastal districts have been experiencing medium to heavy rain since Thursday night, local officials said. The change in weather provided people in Dhaka and elsewhere the much-needed respite from heat and humid condition by bringing rain, an overcast sky and cool breeze. The low-lying areas of these coastal districts and their offshore islands and chars are likely to be inundated by a storm surge 7-10 feet above the height of normal tide. Cyclone Sidr battered part of the shore in Nov 2007, killing around 3,000 people and damaged huge crops and property. A devastating cyclone in Apr 1991 claimed lives of nearly 140,000 people. bdn
