<TITLE> SpiceJet to raise fares after Jet, Kingfisher </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Mumbai, Apr 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Low-cost carrier SpiceJet Ltd will raise fuel surcharge on air tickets by up to 300 rupees after similar moves by Jet Airways and Kingfisher Airlines after last week's rise in jet fuel prices. "We are also looking at increasing the fuel charge by 200 rupees to 300 rupees in the next few days," SpiceJet said in an e-mail to Reuters on Monday. Jet and Kingfisher had raised fuel surcharge by the same amount, effective April 19. The surcharge, levied for travel on domestic sectors, was increased by 200 rupees for routes below 750 kilometres and by 300 rupees for sectors above that. However, state-run Air India has no "immediate plans" to raise fuel surcharge, its spokesman said. The higher fares come after India's state-run oil marketing firms raised the price of aviation turbine fuel (ATF) for domestic carriers by 6.7 percent on April 16. They had earlier raised fuel prices by 10 percent on April 1. ATF prices account for over 40 percent of an airline's operating cost. At 10:57 a.m., SpiceJet shares were up 4.22 percent at 19.00 rupees. Jet Airways was up 5.72 percent at 211.75 rupees and Kingfisher by 7.37 percent at 38.60 rupees.
