<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 19 (bdnews24.com)Markets ended higher on the opening day of the week, driven by banks that recovered from Thursday's losses, though most scrips lost. "Investors opted for only banks. Everything else was put to sale," an official of Latif Securities told bdnews24.com, requesting anonymity. Sunday's markets saw losers dominating across the board, though the turnovers registered an increase from the previous trading day's. Dhaka stocks saw shares worth Tk 4.77 billion changing hands, edging up from Thursday's Tk 4.29 billion, while turnover on the port city's bourse reached Tk 617.682 million, up from 578.055 million of Thursday. Most of the mutual funds lost on profit-taking after the previous day's gains while insurers and pharmaceuticals continued to slide. Power, energy and non-bank financial institutions ended mixed. Market experts said that investors were still sceptical about the market. The sell-off show that they are nervous to put money on shares, said former DSE chief executive Salahuddin Ahmed. "They [retail investors] sold their holdings fearing a fallout." Banks were probably exempted due to their good reputation of being stable entities, he told bdnews24.com. "And institutional investors are also betting on them," added Ahmed, who teaches finance at the Dhaka University.
