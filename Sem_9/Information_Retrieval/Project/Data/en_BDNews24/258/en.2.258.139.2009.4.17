<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 17 (bdnews24.com)Authorities raised warning signal 7 for main port Chittagong, suspended port operations and shut the Chittagong airport Friday as the season's first cyclonic storm, "Bijli", was closing in on southwestern shorelines. They asked fishing boats to rush back to shore and put Red Crescent volunteers and law-enforcers on alert for any emergency, including a possible tidal surge, as the storm was forecast to hit the Chittagong-Barisal coastline by midnight. The cyclonic storm is gaining strength, packing winds up to 90 kph, the Meteorological Department said in a special bulletin. Cox's Bazaar and Mongla ports were asked to keep hoisted danger signal 6 and 5, respectively. Storms are graded with signals ranging from 1 to 10, and authorities start major preparations when the signal is raised to five or beyond. The storm over north Bay of Bengal moved northeastwards and laid over the same area and was centred at 6pm about 235 kms southwest of Chittagong port, 215 kms of Cox's Bazaar and 135 kms south of Mongla. The Meteorology Department said in a special weather bulletin it was likely to weaken gradually and move in a northeasterly direction and may cross Chittagong-Cox's Bazar coast by midnight to night. Its peripheral gusty winds has already been experienced in the coastal districts of Cox's Bazar, Noakhali, Feni, Laxmipur and Bhola Coastal districts have been experiencing medium to heavy rain since Thursday night, local officials said. Maximum sustained wind speed within 54 kms of the cyclone centre is about 70 kph, rising to 90 kph in gusts and squalls. Sea will remain very rough, the bulletin said. The change in weather provided people in Dhaka and elsewhere the much-needed respite from heat and humid condition by bringing rain, an overcast sky and cool breeze. The coastal districts of Chittagong, Noakhali, Feni, Laxmipur, Bhola, Barisal and Chandpur and their offshore islands and chars will come under danger signal seven. The coastal districts of Cox's Bazar and offshore islands and chars will come under danger signal six. The coastal districts of Patuakhali, Barguna, Pirozepur, Jhalokathi, Bagerhat, Khulna, Satkhira, and their offshore islands and chars will come under danger signal five. Under the influence of the storm, the coastal districts of Cox's Bazaar, Chittagong, Noakhali, Feni, Laxmipur, Bhola, Barisal, Patuakhali, Barguna, Chandpur, Pirozepur, Jhalokathi, Bagerhat, Khulna, Satkhira, and their offshore islands and chars are likely to experience heavy rain accompanied by squally wind speed up to 120kph. The low-lying areas of these coastal districts and their offshore islands and chars are likely to be inundated by a storm surge 7-10 feet above the height of normal tide. Cyclone Sidr battered part of the shore in Nov 2007, killing around 3,000 people and damaged huge crops and property. A devastating cyclone in Apr 1991 claimed lives of nearly 140,000 people. bdn
