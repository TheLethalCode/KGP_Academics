<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 20 (bdnews24.com) The government will try only 'identified' war criminals, the state minister for law said Monday. "We won't hold trial for thousands of war criminals. Only the identified will be put in the dock," Kamrul Islam told reporters at the law ministry. But the minister did not name the 'identified' war criminals. Awami League MP Mahmudus Samad Chowdhury placed the proposal to try identified war criminals in the first session of the new parliament. But parliament unanimously decided to try all war criminals. Asked how many days it would take to complete the trial process, Kamrul said: "The sooner the better. We hope to complete the process before the Victory Day on December 16." He said the government's decision to hold trial itself be will treated as FIR or filing of case, when asked if the government will files separate cases. Those who are working on the issue have many information, he said when questioned what information or proof would be presented in trial. Besides newspaper reports during the war, documents preserved in the country and abroad will be tapped into, he added. Kamrul said the government was yet to finalise the investigating and prosecuting teams for trial. A final decision will come after law minister Shafiq Ahmed returned home. The law minister left for Tehran early Monday for a conference of Muslim countries and international experts on efficient judicial processes to deal with war crimes and genocide in Gaza and other occupied territories, he said. The conference takes place from Apr 21-22, with Shafiq returning on the 24th, said Kamrul. "The trial of war criminals is not a trivial matter. It is a difficult and complicated issue. We will disclose the investigating and prosecuting teams after completing all preparations and incorporating all machineries of the state." On the work range and time of the investigating agency Kamrul said: "It is not a matter of fixing a timeframe. The people who collaborated with the Pakistan army in killing, looting and arson will be brought under trial." On the fate of the cases filed against the war criminals across the country the state minister said: "Those cases will not be brught under our investigation. The cases will be handled separately." Pressed to know the international acceptability of the trial as only the associates were being tried keeping aside the main force, he said: "It must have international acceptability. The trial will not be questionable if their trial is not held." "We are yet to decide to try the main force," Kamrul said. The government was not facing any pressure from any country for not trying the war criminals, he added. The state ministers for law and home on Sunday, and home minister Sahara Khatun last week, had all given Monday as a likely date to finalise the investigating and prosecuting teams for the much-awaited war crimes trials. The law minister had chaired a meeting of the committee on war crimes up to late Sunday evening to finalise members of the two teams. The top-level meeting was attended by home minister Sahara Khatun, state minister for home Tanjim Ahmed, the state minister for law, additional attorney general Inayetur Rahim, home secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikder, law secretary Kazi Habibul Awal and lawyers Mosharraf Hossain Kajol and Anisul Haque. But it was adjourned without a final decision, said the state minister for home. Tanjim had said up to seven investigators and five prosecutors were being considered. He said the investigation team would comprise former or serving members of existing investigation agencies. bdnew
