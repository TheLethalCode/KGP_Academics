 Dhaka, April 21(bdnews24.com)BNP leaders have reiterated that the government's notice asking party chief Khaleda Zia to vacate the Dhaka Cantonment house "has no legal basis". "The government will have to bear the consequence if the lease of the house is cancelled," BNP secretary general Khandakar Delwar Hossain said at a protest rally in front of the party's central office on Tuesday evening. "The notice has no legal basis. The house was allotted to Khaleda Zia by the state. It is a settled issue," he said, addressing over a thousand party supporters at the rally organised by student wing Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal. The mass rally was being held just a day after opposition leader Khaleda, widow of slain army chief-turned-president Ziaur Rahman, was served an official notice to vacate the 6 Moinul Road residence. BNP immediately dismissed the notice, calling it "political vendetta", and questioned its legal validity. Party leaders said they were consulting legal experts. They also said ongoing protests against the government's decision. The party has been protesting since the cabinet's April 8 decision to cancel the lease, saying since Khaleda was given a second house, on a 1.5-bigha plot in Gulshan, the allotment of the 9-bigha cantonment house should be cancelled. The government has also argued that no political leader should be based in the cantonment, and Khaleda violated the terms of the lease by conducting political affairs from the house. BNP has said it will only accept a court verdict on the issue. 'Only courts can settle it' "The government will have to go to court to cancel the lease allotment and we are also looking for that," BNP standing committee member Moudud Ahmed MP told a press briefing at his Motijheel chamber on Tuesday. "We will also pursue a legal battle to face the government move," said the barrister. Moudud said the notice, served by the Directorate of Military Lands and Cantonments, didn't mention the government's complaints over violation of lease terms by the BNP chairperson He also said a notice issued by any single organisation cannot scrap any "permanent state allotment". The only option open for the government was to go to the courts, he said. "The defence ministry put into effect a state decision to give the lease of the house to Khaleda Zia by deed. Now, after all this time, the same ministry is saying that it had no legal power to lease out the place," he observed. "The country is heading for instability because of what the Awami League is doing out of retaliation," Delwar warned on Tuesday. "Please stop it," he said, pointing his remarks at the government. "Don't create commotion over the house. Do not push us towards a path of disruptiveness." "We want to extend cooperation to you. Implement the promises you made to the people before election. Avoid the path of retaliation," said Delwar who acted as party chief during Khaleda's time in special jail between 2007-08. The party is set to continue its protest movement with a rally at Muktangan on Wednesday. b
