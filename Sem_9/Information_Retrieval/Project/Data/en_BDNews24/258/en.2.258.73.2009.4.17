<TITLE> La Liga the priority for Barca, says Alves </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MADRID, April 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news from the Primera Liga ahead of this weekend's matches: (All times GMT): Leaders Barcelona have the chance to win three trophies this season, the league, the King's Cup and the European Cup, but it is the Primera Liga title that takes priority, full back Daniel Alves has said. "We have to crown this great season with titles. I am sure Barca will win something. In our minds the most important is the league," the Brazilian told Radio Marca. Pep Guardiola has no injury problems for Saturday's game at Getafe (1800), against the only team left in the league they have not beaten. They drew 1-1 at the Nou Camp in November. Getafe coach Victor Munoz has highlighted Barcelona's defensive organisation over their fearsome forward line, as the key to their impressive campaign. "What strikes me most about them is that they defend well. Most big clubs don't do this very well because they rely on being superior player for player. This is the fundamental difference in this Barca side," he said. Real Madrid, who are six points back in second with eight games left to play, travel to face struggling Recreativo Huelva on Saturday (2000). Juande Ramos's side have won 14 of their last 15 league matches. Recre are three points from safety in 18th after three consecutive defeats. Third-placed Sevilla's home defeat to Getafe last weekend has put them under pressure for their trip to Valencia on Sunday (1700), their midfielder Aldo Duscher has said. Valencia are eight points back in fourth after three wins on the trot. "It will be a key gamealthough like us Valencia still have to play Barca, Real Madrid and Villarreal," the Argentine said. Villarreal need to pick themselves up from the double blows of their midweek Champions League exit to Arsenal, and the losses to injury of influential midfield duo Marcos Senna and Santi Cazorla. Consecutive league defeats have dropped them out of the Champions League qualification places down to fifth, and they are away to Real Valladolid on Sunday (1500). Sixth-placed Atletico Madrid's ability to raise their game for big matches only to slip up against struggling teams will be put to the test again when the side with the worst away record, second-from-bottom Numancia, visit on Saturday (1800). "We have been lucky because our rivals have slipped up when we have, so it hasn't affected us too badly. But we can't afford to fail again (if we want to return to the Champions League next year)," defender Luis Perea said
