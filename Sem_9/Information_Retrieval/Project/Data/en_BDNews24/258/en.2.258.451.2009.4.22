 Bhola, Apr 22 (bdnews24.com)  Road communication with the southern district of Bhola snapped from 5am Wednesday. The Bhola District Bus Owners' Association Monday declared suspension of traffic movement on all routes of the district for an indefinite period. Bhola bus workers then laid siege to the Roads and Highways Department office demanding urgent repair of the Bhola-Charfashion-Aricha regional highway. The workers later took out a protest procession and three demonstrators were injured when police baton-charged them. The injured could not be identified immediately. Additional police were deployed to control the situation. bdnews
