 Dhaka, Apr 16 (bdnews24.com)Amendments to city corporation law will curtail the power of mayors, the local government minister said on Thursday The government will hold all remaining local government electionsincluding to Dhaka City Corporation, municipalities and district councilsby December, Syed Ashraful Islam told reporters. "The current year is going to be the election-year," he said. The deadline for holding the DCC elections expired on May 14, 2007, during the caretaker government's tenure. The tenure of the Chittagong City Corporation mayor and councillors will expire on May 9, 2010. "But there are some inconsistencies in the relevant local government laws," said Ashraf. The minister said if necessary, some laws would be amended and inconsistencies would be removed to hold all elections. "The government is taking preparations, including amending the laws regarding city corporations and municipalities, for holding the elections," he said. He said a proposed amendment to the city corporation law would curtail the power of mayors and their accountability to the government would be ensured. In case of municipalities, new legislation would fix their sources of income, said Ashraf. The so-called autonomous bodies were unable to work independently due to dependency on external funds, he said. "The elections will be held once the laws are finalised," he added. "Ways of holding district council elections are also being discussed. " He said the government was deciding whether they would be held on the "electoral college" system or popular vote. bdne
