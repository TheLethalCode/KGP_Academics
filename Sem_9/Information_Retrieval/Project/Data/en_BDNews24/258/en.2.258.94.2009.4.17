<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 17 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Cricket Board is all set to launch a new tournament styled the Public Universities and Services Cricket Competition from this season. "We initially wanted to hold two competitions with one featuring the public universities and the other with services teams but changed our mind and went with a single competition instead," said BCB tournament committee chairman and director Gazi Ashraf Hossain. The former Bangladesh captain said that the public universities and the services teams were not involved in tournaments after the national cricket championship was restricted only to First Division players and that they would organise this competition every year. Only nine universities and one services team has so far confirmed entries after the tournament committee headed by Hossain invited 29 public universities and three services teams. "There might be some problems for those teams not entering this time. We let everyone know that the BCB would organise this competition every year and I think it will help them to make a budget for their team from the second edition," said Hossain hoping that the number of participants would increase from next season. Hossain also agreed that they might face some problems with the Bangladesh Biman team, who have a good number of players from national team as well as Premier Division. "We have not taken any decision on Biman whether their contracted (employee) players or seasonal players will play for them and the final decision will take in the tournament committee meeting," said Hossain. The BCB director also said that they would also take steps to request those universities reopen their players' quota admission. The matches might be held at the Jahangirnagar University and Bangladesh Krira Shikka Protisthan after approval from the BCB grounds and facilities committee. The format of the competition has not been finalised. Participating teams: Dhaka University, Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology, Sher-e-Bangla Krishi University, Jahangirnagar University, Noakhali Science & Technology University, Khulna University, Islamic University, Bangladesh Biman and Bangladesh Police Cricket Team. bd
