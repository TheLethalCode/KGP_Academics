 Dhaka, Apr 16 (bdnews24.com)  Furniture can turn into a key export in future and the government needs to help streamline the fledgling industry, business leaders say as a six-day National Furniture Fair kicked off in the capital Friday. "Readymade garment is now carrying the colours of Bangladesh to the world. Next, furniture has the potential to carry the emblem," said Annisul Huq, president of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers for Commerce and Industries (FBCCI) at the launch at Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre. In 2007-08 fiscal year, $ 2.44 million worth of furniture were exported, which was 0.02 percent of the total export earnings. Furniture traders discussed the problems facing the sector at the ceremony. "We are lagging behind because of a lack of technology. Besides, there is a lack of institutes which can train people in this trade," said KM Aktaruzzaman, president of Bangladesh Furniture Industry Owners Association. He spoke about the need to streamline and protect the industry by creating a national policy and to develop raw materials as substitutes for costly wood. Around Tk 2.5 lakh crore worth of furniture are sold worldwide a year, including Tk 4,000 crore in Bangladesh, he added. Local demand is met mostly by local traders and heavy duty needs to be levied on imported furniture and less tax on raw materials, said Selim H Rahman, secretary general of the organisation. Trade minister Faruq Khan said the government would support the development of the industry and see to it foreign furniture did not harm the local industry. He pledged assistance to boost export by creating opportunities for local traders to attend international trade fairs. Faruq said he will ask the education minister to introduce new courses on furniture design and trade. He asked the traders to retain the big local market of furniture in the midst of global recession and develop new designs. Fifty-five furnishers and furniture export institutes are taking part in the fair, open from 6am to 9pm until Apr 21. b
