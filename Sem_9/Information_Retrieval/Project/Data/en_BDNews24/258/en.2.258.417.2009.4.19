 Dhaka, April 19 (bdnews24.com) - The government's just-announced stimulus package aims to boost domestic spending to tackle the effects of global recession, said economist Zaid Bakht in an instant reaction on Sunday. "The government's aim is to heighten internal demand through a huge increase in agriculture subsidies," said Bakht, senior research director of Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies. In an instant reaction to bdnews24.com, Bakht said the rise in internal demand could offset the fall in the country's export demands due to the global recession. The stimulus package, unveiled Sunday morning by finance minister AMA Muhith, gives a massive Tk 2000 crore to agricultureraising subsidies by Tk 1500 crore, from Tk 4,285 crore to Tk 5,785 crore, and recapitalising agro loans to Tk 1,500 crore from Tk 1,000 crore. Among other measures, subsidies in the power sector will be doubled to Tk 1,200 crore from Tk 600 crore, while cash incentives to export sectors will be raised by Tk 450 crore. On greater cash incentives for exports of jute, leather and frozen food, Bakht said he thought it would create an "immediate effect". "But proper and timely disbursement of the incentives is very important," he added.
