 KABUL, Tue Apr 21, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghanistan has made progress in talks with the Taliban for ending the conflict and is engaged with its foreign allies to remove names of some militants from wanted lists, a government spokesman said on Tuesday. With violence spreading in recent times, more than seven years since the Taliban's ouster, some Western officials have said the Afghan war cannot be won militarily and eventually talks will have to be held with the militants to end it.

Hamidzada reiterated comments this week by Karzai that talks with the Taliban will not succeed unless the Afghan government is involved. The Taliban have described Obama's offer of talks as a "lunatic" idea and say they will fight until all foreign troops leave Afghanistan. U.S.-backed Afghan forces drove the Taliban from power in 2001 after its leadership refused to hand over al Qaeda leaders wanted by Washington for the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States. The Taliban made a comeback in recent years, spreading their attacks to previously secure areas despite an increase in foreign troops, now numbering more than 70,000. To fight instability in Afghanistan and its nuclear-armed neighbour Pakistan, Obama has pledged to send 21,000 more troops to Afghanistan and pump more aid to both nat
