 Chittagong, Apr 21 (bdnews24.com) - A crew member was missing and shipping was suspended as a vessel carrying clinker sank in the Karnaphuli channel at Chittagong port Tuesday night. Eleven crewmen of the lighter ship 'Seven Circle-25', which went down at around 8:30pm, managed to swim to shore. "The twelfth crewman, Bahar Master, remains missing," deputy port conservator Captain Nazmul Alam told bdnews24.com at around 10pm. The lighter vessel sank after taking on clinker from a mother ship at the outer anchorage. It was becoming impossible to locate the accident spot in the dark and stormy weather, said the port official. He said they suspected the ship might have sunk due to the storm. "As special cautionary measures all types of ship movement in the Karnaphuli channel has been suspended for the night," he said. A further decision will come Tuesday morning after identifying and inspecting the accident spot, he said. bd
