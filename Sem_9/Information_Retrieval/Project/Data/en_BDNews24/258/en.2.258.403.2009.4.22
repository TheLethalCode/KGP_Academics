<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 22 (bdnews24.com)The Muslim world must act together to try the genocide and war crimes perpetrated by Israel in the Gaza Strip and Occupied Territories, law minister Shafiq Ahmed said on Wednesday. The law minister was addressing a conference of lawyers from Muslim countries on efficient judicial and legal mechanisms to deal with war crimes and genocide in Gaza and the Occupied Territories. "The Muslim world will have to be prompt in determining efficient laws and legal mechanisms for trying Israeli genocide and war crimes," a law ministry statement quoted the minister as saying at Iran's capital Tehran. "Israel is launching offensive on innocent civilians and their establishments which is violation of international convention, agreements and human rights," he added Bangladesh never supports such inhuman attack of Israel. The whole world including the Muslim world will have to play a very active role in preventing Israel from carrying such anti-humanitarian activities, he added. The minister said The Hague-based International Court established in the light of 1998 Rome Statute can play a part in holding the trial for the genocide and war crimes in the Gaza and Occupied Territories. "The organisation can hold trial for the serious offence which takes place in the international arena. It is not mandatory for any country to be signatory to the Rome Statute for trial of the criminals," Shafiq said "It is also not mandatory for the complainant to be sovereign state or nation for trial of genocide, war crime and anti humanitarian activities," he said Citing example of Nazi trial for atrocities on the Jews under the international court, he said, "The court tried Germans despite Jews having no sovereign state." "So the trial of Israel is also possible for genocide and war crimes against Palestinians." The minister is likely to return home on Apr 25 after attending the two-day conference that began on Tuesday.
