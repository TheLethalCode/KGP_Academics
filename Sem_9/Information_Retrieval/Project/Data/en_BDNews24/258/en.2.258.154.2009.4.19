 CAPE TOWN, South Africa, Apr 19 (bdnews24.com) Sporadic rain in Cape Town dampened Kings XI Punjab IPL start as they went down to Delhi Daredevils by 10 wickets. Rain interruption saw Delhi Daredevils' target revised to 54 runs to win in six overs, in reply to Punjab's 104 for 7. Earlier, intermittent rain delayed the start and reduced the game to 12 overs a side. Delhi were 24/0 when rain came down. With all wickets intact, the D/L method swung in Delhi's favour. Nevertheless, they have started their IPL campaign on a winning note. Gautam Gambhir and Virender Sehwag remained unbeaten on 15 and 32 respectively. Earlier Delhi skipper Sehwag won the toss and chose to field. Soon after the toss, it started pouring again. As a result, the game was shortened to 12 overs a side. But the way Kings XI openers started the proceedings, it looked like they would score more than 150 runs in 12 overs. But Delhi bowler Daniel Vettori picked three crucial wickets and executed a run out to restrict them for 104/7. Punjab openers Karan Goel and Ravi Bopara fell in quick succession after the duo gave a sensational start to the team. Karan butchered Delhi bowlers and made 38 runs before Yo Mahesh struck to dismiss him. Bopara and Karan started their '12 overs a side' game confidently and made 67 runs for the first wicket. Bopara looked to attack from the very outset and played some juicy shots. Karan, taking cue from his partner, also went on to smack the Delhi bowlers. In his quickfire knock of 38 runs, Karan hit three fours and three sixes. He was looking to launch one from Mahesh into the crowd but the ball took the top edge of his bat and was taken by Vettori at mid-off. Vettori was soon introduced and the Kiwi skipper proved his utility quickly as he caught Bopara plumb in front to the middle stump. He struck two massive sixes during his knock of 22 runs. Vettori struck again to remove Sri Lankan batsman Sangakkara, who tried to go for the pull over the short fine leg region but found Dirk Nannes there. He could add only 8 runs. Punjab skipper Yuvraj Singh played a couple of sixes before he was run-out by Vettori. Yuvraj made only 16 runs. Jayawardene made six runs before he mistimed a shot off Vettori and was taken by compatriot Tillkaratne Dilshan at long-off. Leg-spinner Piyush Chawla went his skipper's way without even opening his account. Irfan Pathan threw away his wicket off the last ball of the innings while trying to clear the boundary. The shot off Avishkar Salvi's last delivery had more elevation than the distance and was taken successfully by Dils
