 Abdur Rahim Harmachi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Apr 21(bdnews24.com)The Bangladesh Better Business Forum, a high-powered body formed during the last caretaker government for strengthening the country's trade and economy, will get a new footing, the finance minister has said. Talking exclusively with bdnews24.com on Monday, AMA Muhith said, "The forum worked well during the caretaker government's two years. Quite a good number of recommendations from the BBF had a positive impact on the country's economy." "So we want to revive the BBF," he said. The Fakhruddin Ahmed-led interim administration, in a move hailed by businesses, unveiled the 38-strong high-profile forum on Nov 26, 2007 to maintain institutional relations with the private sector. Its stated aim had been "to create an environment favourable to investment and economic growth". The government will soon reconstitute the body with the prime minister at its head, as the chief adviser had been before, said Muhith. "There will be little change to the number and composition of members and its working areas will be the same," he said. He said the forum would meet at least once a month, as it did previously, to suggest measures for the economy to overcome hurdles. "And the government will enforce the recommendations," said the minister. The forum was launched with members from the top tiers of the government and private sector. Muhith said he met Sunday with a number of BBF members, including the FBCCI president, all of whom asked the government to keep up the forum active. Anisul Huq, president of the country's apex trade body FBCCI, also lauded the efficiency of the BBF and said the institution was able to ensure swift actions as the head of the government was the chief of the body. "There was little bureaucratic tangle," Huq said, with a hope that the body would be able to carry out its tasks under the present government as well to boost the country's economy and trade. bdne
