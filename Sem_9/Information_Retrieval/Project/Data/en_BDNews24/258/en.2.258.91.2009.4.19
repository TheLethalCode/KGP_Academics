 Dhaka, April 19 (bdnews24.com)Finance minister AMA Muhith unveiled a support package Sunday, to tackle the immediate impact of the global recession, amounting to Tk 3,424 crore for the remaining quarter of the current fiscal year. The government has divided its recession package into two parts  an immediate allocation for the current fiscal year 2008-09 and one for 2009-10, said the minister. "The package will be executed in two phases  an emergency step (FY 2008-09) and a medium to long term programme to be implemented in 2009-10," he said. The amended budget for FY 2008-09 will require the additional allocation of Tk 3,424 crore for the first phase, said Muhtih. This will go to increase subsidies in power and agriculture and raise the rate of cash incentives for recession-hit exporters in the remaining few months of the current fiscal year. The current budget for the mentioned sectors - power, agro and exports - will be revised to Tk 14,554 crore from Tk 11,130 crore, said the finance minister. "We have also adopted policy support along with incentives to keep the Bangladesh economy vibrant in the face of the global crisis," said Muhith. The prime minister's finance adviser Moshiur Rahman, Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed, finance secretary Muhammad Tareq, commerce secretary Feroz Ahmed, NBR acting chairman Nasiruddin Chowdhury and ERD secretary Mosharraf Hossain Bhuiyan were also present during the announcement at the finance ministry. bd
