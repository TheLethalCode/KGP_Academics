 Dhaka, Apr 22 (bdnews24.com)  State minister for home Tanjim Ahmed has warned of the government getting tough on any agitators stirring up public unrest over water and power crises. "If any opportunists attempt to disturb law and order taking advantage of the water and power shortages they will be dealt with stringently," the state minister told reporters Wednesday after a core committee meeting at the ministry. His comments came a day after angry residents in Araihazar, Narayanganj, damaged a power sub-station, and attacked a rural power supply office and a police outpost, protesting against repeated outages. Tanjim said the past BNP-led coalition government embezzled thousands of crores of taka channelled to the power sector, wgich was why people were now suffering from lack of power and water. "The power stations are public property. People must work alongside the government to save the sector." "I hope the crises will be resolved soon with the people's cooperation," Tanjim said. Replying to a query he said: "I would request the BNP chairperson to vacate the Dhaka Cantonment house soon, being a responsible person and serving as prime minister in the past." "If I were in her place I would have left the house much earlier," he said. Questioned about a recent comment by Awami League general secretary Abdul Jalil that many ministers in the government were 'paid agents of DGFI' during the past caretaker government, Tanjim did not make any direct comment. He said: "Everyone has right to freedom of expression. Everyone can express their opinions. But we don't have to believe what they say is true," the state minister said. bdn
