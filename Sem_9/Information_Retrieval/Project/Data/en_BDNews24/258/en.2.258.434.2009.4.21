<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 21 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary watchdog has said the government should scrap a deal with Singapore-based Ipco International Ltd for construction of a five-star hotel and golf course adjacent to Zia International Airport. The standing committee on the civil aviation and tourism ministry on Tuesday also recommended taking legal steps against the company for violating the terms of the deal by "delaying construction". "We observed that Ipco completely failed to act in accordance with the agreement," committee chairman Engineer Mosharraf Hossain told reporters after a meeting Tuesday. He said, under the deal signed with the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh in 1999, Ipco was supposed to start construction on the 315 bighas (105 acres) of land within one and a half years of signing. "Therefore, we have recommended to cancel the deal and asked the civil aviation authority to take legal action against the errant company," said Mosharraf. But Ipco's executive chairman Abul Khair Litu says his company is not responsible for violating the deal. "We are not at fault. The total fault goes to the government for not approving the plans." "If the government wants, it can take the land back providing compensation as per the agreement," Litu told bdnews24.com. The deal was signed a decade ago when Engineer Mosharraf Hossain, now standing committee chairman, was civil aviation minister. But civil aviation officials have told bdnews24.com that the land is a necessity for the expansion of Zia International Airport. The current monetary value of the land is Tk 3,150 crore, according to the land registration office. Moinuddin Khan Badal, a committee member who attended Tuesday's meeting, told bdnews24.com: "All the members, especially the chairman, feel the agreement is void as Ipco failed to begin construction within the stipulated time." "The civil aviation minister and the secretary told the meeting that the deal would be cancelled soon in line with the committee's recommendation," he said.
