 By Arshad Mahmud Washington, Apr 21 (bdnews24.com)The New York Times won five Pulitzer Prizes on Monday for reports on subjects as varied as America's wars in Asia, the sudden downfall of a political titan, art from ancient to modern and a history-making presidential campaign. Administered by the Columbia University Journalism School, the Prize is considered the most prestigious and coveted in print journalism. The latest five takes the Times over the hundred mark, with a total of 101 awards since the Pulitzers were first established in 1917, by far the most of any news organisation. Only twice has an organisation won more than five in a year: in 2002, when The Times won seven, and last year, when The Washington Post won six. The Los Angeles Times won five in 2004. Bill Keller, executive editor of The New York Times, said that while budget cuts have convinced many newspapers that they cannot pay for expensive work like investigations and overseas reporting, "this paper has decided it can't afford not to do those things." "[But] prizes are not the reason we do what we do, or the measure of it," he added, saying that he was especially proud of The Times's coverage of the financial crisis, a finalist in the public service category that did not win a Pulitzer. In fact, no organisation won for economic coverage. The Times won the prize for breaking news reporting, for its coverage of the rapid disintegration of New York Governor Eliot Spitzer's political career when the newspaper revealed he had been a client of a prostitution ring. The Times's won the prize for international reporting for its coverage of the war and political struggle in Afghanistan and Pakistan. David Barstow won the prize for investigative reporting examining the conflicts of interest among the military analysts who help television networks cover the wars in Asia. He found out that those analystsmostly former military officerswere paid by the Pentagon to speak favorably about the war during President Bush's administration. The prestigious prize for public service went to The Las Vegas Sun for its exploration of a large number of construction worker deaths at some of that city's biggest building sites. The St. Petersburg Times won two awards, including one in the national reporting category, for its PolitiFact project, which checks the truth of political claims. The other was won by Lane DeGregory, for feature writing. The prize for breaking news photography went to Patrick Farrell of The Miami Herald for his images from Haiti of the destruction left by a hurricane. Bettina Boxall and Julie Cart of The Los Angeles Times won the prize for explanatory reporting, for their examination of wildfires in the West. Eugene Robinson of The Washington Post won for commentary; the award for editorial writing went to Mark Mahoney of The Post-Star in tiny Glens Falls, N.Y.; and Steve Breen of The San Diego Union-Tribune won in the editorial cartooning category
