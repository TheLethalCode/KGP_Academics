<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 17 (bdnews24.com)The main opposition BNP will dissolve district units and replace them with convening committees by next week, a senior BNP leader said Friday. Fomer law minister Moudud Ahmed revealed his party's plans to make room for new committees from grassroots to the highest level through election and hold its national council by late July. "The task to reconstitute the party is at its final stage," he told reporters at his residence in Gulshan in the capital. "It may be possible to hold the national council by July 25," said the MP, who is also a member of BNP's standing committee, the party's highest policy-making body . Moudud, elected to Bogra-7 in the recent by-elections, said if they failed to hold the council by the time they would explain the reasons to the Election Commission. EC rules obligate political parties to hold councils by July 25. Legal battle looms The former law minister also spoke of the party's stance on the notice to be served on party chief Khaleda Zia after the cabinet revoked the lease on the sprawling Dhaka Cantonment mansion allotted 'illegally' to her. A debate is raging between the government and the BNP over the house. The government plans to build blocks of flats for the family members of the army officers slain in the Feb 25-26 BDR mutiny. "We are waiting for the notice and preparing for a legal battle as well. We will move after seeing what's there in the notice," Moudud said. "The government is moving on the issue out of vindictiveness," he alleged. The house was allotted to Khaleda Zia and her family through a permanent lease deed, he added. The government cancelled the lease only to put the pressing issues to the backburner, said Moudud, who has changed political spots for two decades and sat on the cabinet of military dictator HM Ershad who allotted the house to Khaleda in 1981. He said the previous the Awami League government had asked the defence ministry on July 8, 2001 to evict Khaleda, but the Cantonment Board refused. "Legally, it can't be done." bdnew
