 Dhaka, Apr 16 (bdnews24.com)Profit-taking after days of gains caused the country's stock exchanges to end almost flat on the closing day of the week. Investors sold-off banks to reap profits from the recent gains, according to market observers. Banks, accounting for 52 percent of market capitalisation, rose for the last three days, which allowed the indices to shake off a bearish trend that had continued for weeks. Thursday saw gainers dominating across the board with turnovers holding stable. DSE shares worth Tk 4.29 billion changing hands, edging up from Wednesday's Tk 4 billionwhile turnover on the port city's bourse reached to Tk 578.055 million, slightly down from 578.415 million the previous day. Meanwhile, insurers, pharmaceuticals, power and energy shares joined the losing streak following Wednesday's gains. Non-bank financial institutions and mutual funds continued to rally. Market experts said, the day's trading reflected investors' edginess. "[Thursday's] profit taking is a sign of nervousness," former DSE chief executive Salahuddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com. The price correction of banks was just starting, he said. But investors due to low confidence in the market went for profit taking after four days of gains in banking shares, he said. "The selling hype caused insurers, power and pharma shares to witness losses," added Ahmed, who teaches finance at the Dhaka University.
