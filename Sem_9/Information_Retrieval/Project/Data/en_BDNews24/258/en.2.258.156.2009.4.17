 New Delhi, Apr 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The following is a snapshot of recent developments in India's general election campaign. (The sources are mentioned in brackets). At least 62 percent people voted in the first phase of India's general election. The vote was marred by Maoist violence in some states. The turnout was lower in some of the same areas than the last election held in 2004. (The Times of India) Varun Gandhi, the great grandson of the country's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, was released on parole after spending 20 days in prison, accused of making inflammatory comments against Muslims in an election speech. Gandhi, who is contesting polls as a candidate for the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), will be out of prison for two weeks to file nomination papers and campaign. (The Hindu) A shoe thrown at L.K. Advani, the BJP's prime ministerial candidate, by a former party worker, narrowly missed him at an election rally in a central Indian state, but the incident has forced Indian politicians to step up their personal security.(The Indian Express)
