 Dhaka, Apr 19 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia chaired a two-hour meeting of the party's highest policy making body Sunday to reach a final decision on reconstitution, said party leaders. Standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain said they were aiming for a "final result". "We have been holding a series of meetings. Today's meeting might see a final result," he told bdnews24.com before the meeting that began at around 8.45pm. However, BNP leaders had nothing to announce as the meeting ended at 10.30pm. The standing committee in recent weeks has been reviewing six divisional reports on reconstitution of party units from the grassroots level. Another senior BNP leader, Moudud Ahmed, said Friday that BNP would dissolve its district units and replace them with convening committees within the week. "The task to reconstitute the party is at its final stage," he said. Joint secretaries general Abdullah Al Noman, Mirza Abbas, Selima Rahman, MA Mannan, Goyeshwar Chandra Roy and Nazrul Islam Khan prepared the six reports in consultation with upazila, thana and municipality leaders in the six divisions. The standing committee comprises 10 members led by Khaleda Zia. Other members are M Saifur Rahman, Khandaker Delwar Hossain, Abdul Matin Chowdhury, RA Goni, Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, Moudud Ahmed, Mahbubuddin Ahmad, Mahbubur Rahman and M Shamsul Islam. b
