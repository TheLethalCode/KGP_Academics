 Dhaka, Apr 21 (bdnews24.com)  Police recovered Tuesday bodies of two men from two different places in the city. A slaughtered body of an unknown person, with full pants and shirt still on, was recovered from Banani at 6:30am in the morning, said Mir Rezaul Karim, officer-in-charge of Gulshan Police Station. Awai in Uttara, the bullet-hit body of Md Mithu, a 25-year-old businessman, was recovered by railway police from Azampur Railgate at 12:30am, said Md Amir Hossain, a railway police officer. The bodies were sent to the morgue of Dhaka Medical College. Mithu was involved with Mamoni Jewellers and readymade garment business in Kochukhet. "He did not come home Monday night though he said he would. His mother got a call from his mobile at 9:30pm which said that his dead body was lying at Azampur Railgate. Later, we went there and found him," said Delwar, Mithu's relative. "A group of local thugs demanded tolls from Mithu a few months ago. He might be killed for that," he said. bd
