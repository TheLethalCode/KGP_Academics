 MUMBAI, April 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A special court on Thursday appointed a new lawyer for the man accused of being the lone surviving gunman of the Mumbai attacks, and heard the prosecution intends to produce nearly 2,000 witnesses to prove its case. Judge M.L Tahilyani appointed Abbas Kazmi to represent Mohammed Ajmal Kasab a day after his previous lawyer was dismissed due to a conflict of interest. "After due deliberation it was decided advocate Abbas Kazmi will represent the accused," Tahilyani said in the specially built court housed in Arthur Road jail, where Kasab is held. Kazmi said he had volunteered his services because other lawyers had been unwilling. Legal representation for Kasab, who is charged with "waging war" against India during the attacks that killed 166 people, has been a contentious issue, with several lawyers refusing to step forward and others being threatened by Hindu nationalist outfits. Kasab, who on Wednesday repeated a request for a Pakistani lawyer, was told by the judge on Thursday that the Foreign Ministry had not responded to the court's request. Police say Kasab, who sat barefoot in the dock dressed in a long-sleeved T-shirt and navy blue track pants, was one of 10 gunmen who arrived in Mumbai last November by sea from Pakistan and rampaged through the city, killing nearly 170 people. State prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam, who will make his opening remarks on Friday, told the court he intends to produce 1,820 witnesses and more than 750 pieces of evidence to prove Kasab's guilt in seven cases, and indirect involvement in five others. Kasab could face the gallows if found guilty. The attacks on India's financial hub sparked renewed tensions between India and Pakistan, with New Delhi saying state agencies were involved in the attacks. Islamabad has denied the charge.
