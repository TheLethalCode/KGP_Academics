 ROME, April 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news ahead of this weekend's matches in Serie A (all times GMT): Keeper Julio Cesar is expected to return from a groin strain as leaders Inter Milan seek to close in on the Serie A title in Saturday's clash with second-placed Juventus in Turin (1830). The Brazilian was back in training with his team mates this week after missing Saturday's 2-2 draw with Palermo, which sent Inter 10 points clear with the help of Juve's 3-2 defeat at Genoa. However, Colombian defender Nelson Rivas injured knee ligaments in training on Thursday and looks set to be out for the rest of the season. Juventus captain Alessandro Del Piero and David Trezeguet are contesting a place up front alongside Vincenzo Iaquinta, who can be confident of a starting place thanks to his strong form, Italian media say. Fellow striker Amauri has recovered from a thigh injury but looks unlikely to start after a month out, while Juventus boss Claudio Ranieri is without suspended midfielders Mauro Camoranesi and Claudio Marchisio. Marco Marchionni is favourite to take Camoranesi's place on the right wing, while Cristiano Zanetti, whose season has been disrupted by injury, and Tiago may also come in after Christian Poulsen had a bad game in the centre of the park at Genoa. Captain Paolo Maldini should return for third-placed AC Milan's home game against Torino (1830) on Sunday after missing last week's 1-0 win at Chievo Verona with a thigh muscle problem. Maldini's presence would boost a back-line without the suspended Marek Jankulovski. Coach Carlo Ancelotti has a touchline ban for being sent off for dissent in Verona. Sixth-placed AS Roma will have to contend with injuries and suspensions when they entertain Lecce on Sunday (1300) needing a win for their bid to close an eight-point gap on fourth-placed Genoa and claim a Champions League slot. Defenders Cicinho and Juan, midfielder Alberto Aquilani and forward Mirko Vucinic have fitness problems while the back-line is also without Christian Panucci and Philippe Mexes, who were sent off in Saturday's 4-2 defeat by Lazio. Coach Luciano Spalletti will be unable to sit in the dugout after he too was given a red card during the derby. Fifth-placed Fiorentina also have troubles with suspensions ahead of Sunday's visit to Udinese (1300). Felipe Melo is serving the first part of a five-match ban for fighting with Cagliari's Diego Lopez at the end of last weekend's 2-1 win, while fellow midfielder Riccardo Montolivo is also out after getting a yellow card
