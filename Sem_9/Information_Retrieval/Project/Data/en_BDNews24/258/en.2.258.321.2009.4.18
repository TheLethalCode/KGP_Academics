 MANCHESTER, England, April 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Alex Ferguson's quest for a sixth FA Cup success with Manchester United faces a stern test against a "hungry" Everton side on Sunday. United face their Premier League rivals in the semi-final of the competition at Wembley and a win will ensure Ferguson's team a place in the final for the fourth time in six years. "My problem on Sunday is that we are facing a hungry team," Ferguson told a news conference on Friday. "They want to win a trophy but we have got to make sure we are on top of our game." Everton have not won a major trophy for 14 years, whereas United are course for five this season with the Premier League leaders having already won the League Cup and FIFA Club World Championship. Holders United also face a two-leg semi-final date with Arsenal in the Champions League. "I'm not getting into all that," Ferguson said, playing down the prospect of finishing the season with five trophies "All I'm thinking about is our next game which is Everton on Sunday. Then we play Portsmouth in the league next Wednesday. "I'm not looking at anything further." Wes Brown returned to training on Friday after a lengthy knee injury although the tie comes too soon for the defender. However, Ferguson will make changes to the side which defeated Porto in midweek to advance to the last four stage of the Champions League. "Wednesday was a very high tempo game," said Ferguson. "There's a loss of energy in parts of the team and I have to recognise that. I will be making changes.
