 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com energy correspondent Dhaka, Apr 20 (bdnews24.com)Petrobangla will 'soon' give the go-ahead to Scottish exploration company Cairn Energy to sell any gas finds in Magnama and Hatia to a third party, the state-owned oil and gas exploration authority's chief has said. Cairn had proposed to sell gas at a price higher than that fixed in the production-sharing contract (PSC) to a third party, beyond Petrobangla, if it struck commercially viable reserves in Magnama and Hatia through a 3-D survey. The company that is drilling Magnama and Hatia said it could not make profit if it sold any new gas at the same price as that of its other offshore field at Sangu. Petrobangla said a maximum gas purchase price has been determined in the PSC with the Cairn. Currently, Cairn sells gas from the Sangu field at around $ 2.70 per thousand cubic feet. "A decision on the issue will soon be sent to the [energy and mineral resources] ministry," the Petrobangla acting chairman Md Moktadir Ali told bdnews24.com Sunday. He made no further comment. A top official of Petrobangla, who spoke to bdnews24.com on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to media, said the authority had already formed their opinion and would tell the ministry about it in a couple of days. The official said the PSC with Cairn Energy does in fact allow the exploration company to sell gas to a third party. Having failed to strike any commercially viable gas reserves in the two areas after drilling wells last winter, Cairn proposed a 3-D survey there. The Scottish firm told Petrobangla that it had already spent $117 million on exploration and will spend a further $30 million on 3-D survey. And if gas reserves are found, it said it would have to splash out more than $100 million to drill wells and set up offshore platform. Cairn is now operating Bangladesh's lone offshore gas field at Sangu in the Bay of Bengal and supplying approximately 55 million cubic feet of gas per day (mmcfd) to the national gas grid. bdn
