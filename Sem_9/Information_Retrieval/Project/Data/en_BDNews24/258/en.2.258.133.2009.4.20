<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 20 (bdnews24.com)Textile industry leaders on Monday questioned the wisdom of the government's recession task force, or working group, after mill owners failed to secure a cash incentive hike under the government's newly announced support package to face the global recession. President of the Bangladesh Textile Mill Association, Abdul Hye, called it a suicidal decision not to give the sector a boost and termed the package "bereft of reality". "How far are the government taskforce members aware of the overall condition of the textile sector? Do they have least idea about its contribution to the country's economy and exports?" he asked, at a press conference. The textile sector, which supports the country's biggest export earnergarmentsalready enjoys a five percent cash incentive. Hye demanded a hike up to 15 percent. "The taskforce solely consisted of bureaucrats, former bureaucrats, economists and civil society members with no representative from the Tk 40,000 crore textile sector." "Due to the global recession, our spinning and weaving mills are facing unhealthy competition". "Our competitors India, Pakistan and China are providing stimulus packages for their textile sectors and so their production cost is now 30-40 percent lower than ours," he said. Hye also said loan rates should be lowered to single digits. BTMA member Anwar-ul-Alam, also a former BGMEA president, also criticised the government for giving priority to the agriculture sector in the package. Describing the garments industries as the "worst hit by the recession", he said, providing subsidies to the agriculture was "a government agenda which has no link to the recession." Suggesting the government immediately sit with businessmen, he said: "We'll need no government help if bank loan rates are fixed at 11 percent and smooth power supply is ensured." Textiles may still get boost: Muhith Finance minister AMA Muhith, meanwhile, has said the textile sector may still get a boost after it was "overlooked" in the support package. Muhith on Sunday rolled out a Tk 3,424 crore support package for the last quarter of the current fiscal year to shield farming, power and export sectors from the effects of the global slowdown. Though it raised incentive rates for some export sectors, namely jute, leather and frozen fish, it did not raise them for textiles. Muhith said Monday he "forgot" to include the vital sector. "I forgot to include the textile sector. We had everything ready. But they were overlooked at the last moment," he said. "My package might have not satisfied all, but the door is not closed," said the minister. He said the government would consider extending further support to those "really affected" by the recession. Asked whether the incentives in the textile sector would be increased in the current package or in the next budget, Muhith said the working group would decide on it. bdne
