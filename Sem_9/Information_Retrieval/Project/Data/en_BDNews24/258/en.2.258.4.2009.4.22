 JOHANNESBURG, Wed Apr 22, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africans voted on Wednesday in an election expected to preserve the dominance of the African National Congress despite the strongest opposition challenge since apartheid ended 15 years ago. The ANC looks assured a fourth straight win since defeating white minority rule in 1994 under Nelson Mandela and will make its leader Jacob Zuma president weeks after he succeeded in getting corruption charges dropped on a technicality. But the party faces an unprecedented challenge from opposition parties hoping to capitalize on frustration over corruption, poverty and crime, and could lose the two-thirds majority that gives it the right to change the constitution and entrench its power further. Queues snaked before dawn outside polling stations across South Africa, the continent's biggest economy and diplomatic heavyweight. With some 23 million eligible voters, a high turnout could strengthen Zuma's authority. "I think people will give the ANC a bigger mandate to try and sort out some of government's challenges. Remember, Rome wasn't built in a day," said Alex Saziwa, 72, a self-employed businessman in Cape Town. Many analysts believe the ANC, whose anti-apartheid credentials make it the choice for millions of black voters, will win between 60 and 66 percent of the vote, compared to nearly 70 percent in 2004. A smaller ANC majority would cheer investors keen to see its grip loosened. Despite Zuma's assurances, they fear he may bow to leftist allies who say the poor lost out from policies credited with South Africa's longest spell of growth over the past decade. RECESSION But as South Africa heads toward its first recession in 17 years, its mines and factories hard hit by the global downturn, Zuma's room for policy change is limited. Finance Minister Trevor Manuel, a market favorite, is expected to stay for now. One key challenge to the ANC comes from a new party formed by those loyal to former President Thabo Mbeki, who was ousted by the ANC amid allegations he meddled in a corruption case against Zuma. The charges were dropped on a technicality. The first credible black opposition party to the ANC, the Congress of the People (COPE) has some support among the growing black middle class, but has faltered as it struggles to win over the poor majority. COPE presidential candidate Mvume Dandala said he was still optimistic that the new party could bring change. "It is a baby with teeth. We can bite and I do believe the people of South Africa have heard our message," he said. The official opposition Democratic Alliance, resurgent under its new leader Helen Zille, a white South African, also hopes to boost its presence in parliament and has campaigned under a "Stop Zuma" slogan, aiming to attract voters uneasy over the ANC's record on corruption. "I think South African voters know what we need to do to save democracy and to ensure that a government delivers. I know that they know what to do to prevent a criminal state and they'll go out today and do it," Zille said. Polls close at 9 p.m. (1900 GMT) and first results are expected late on Wednesday n
