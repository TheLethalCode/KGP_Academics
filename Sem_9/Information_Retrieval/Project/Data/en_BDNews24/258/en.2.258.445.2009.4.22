 Dhaka Apr 22 (bdnews24.com)  The government has decided to drastically cut land registration fee to net more revenues, the finance minister has said. "Many pay less in fees than they ought, by providing false information on land purchases to save on the registration cost," AMA Muhith told reporters Wednesday after an inter-ministerial meeting at the Secretariat. The government loses out on significant revenue because of this, he said. At present, a 14-18 percent registration fee is charged on the total price of the land. For instance, Tk 14 to 18 lakh has to be paid in registration for a piece of land bought for Tk 1 crore. "If the fee is lowered land buyers are less likely to provide false information, and the government will eventually realise more revenue," Muhith said. The meeting also decided to cut the land registration process to a single phase from four separate steps. Both decisions will be sent to the cabinet for approval, said the minister. bd
