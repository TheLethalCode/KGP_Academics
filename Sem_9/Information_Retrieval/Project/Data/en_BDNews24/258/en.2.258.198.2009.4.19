 Dhaka, April 19 (bdnews24.com)Finance minister AMA Muhith unveiled the government's much-anticipated stimulus package Sunday, amounting to Tk 3,424 crore for the current fiscal year to tackle the immediate impact of the global recession. This will go to increase subsidies in power and agriculture and raise the rate of cash incentives for recession-hit exporters in the remaining few months of FY 2008-09. The government has divided its recession package into two parts  an immediate allocation for the current year and one for 2009-10, said the minister. "The package will be executed in two phases  an emergency step (FY 2008-09) and a medium to long term programme to be implemented in 2009-10." The amended budget for FY 2008-09 will require the additional allocation of Tk 3,424 crore for the first phase package, said Muhith. The current budget for the mentioned sectors - power, agro and exports - will be revised to Tk 14,554 crore from Tk 11,130 crore, he said. "We have also adopted policy support along with incentives to keep the Bangladesh economy vibrant in the face of the global crisis," said Muhith. The breakdown Among other measures, agricultural subsidies will see a rise to Tk 5,785 crore from Tk 4,285 crore and subsidies in the power sector will be doubled to Tk 1,200 crore from Tk 600 crore. Agricultural loans will also be recapitalised to Tk 1,500 crore from Tk 1,000 crore and social safety net programmes (food) to Tk 4,569 crore from Tk 4,195 crore. For the export sector, cash incentives for jute and jute goods will be raised to 10 percent from 7.5 percent, for leather and leather goods to 17.5 percent from 15 percent and for frozen fish to 12.5 percent from 10 percent. The total allocation for these sectors will rise to Tk 1,500 crore from Tk 1,050 crore with the new rates. Incentives for export of locally-produced textiles, agricultural commodities (vegetables and fruits) and processed foods will also remain, said Muhith. The prime minister's finance adviser Moshiur Rahman, Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed, finance secretary Muhammad Tareq, commerce secretary Feroz Ahmed, NBR acting chairman Nasiruddin Chowdhury and ERD secretary Mosharraf Hossain Bhuiyan were also present for the announcement of the 'Stimulus package to tackle global recession' at the finance ministry. bd
