 Dhaka, Apr 19 (bdnews24.com) - The national textbook expert committee has recommended distributing books free of cost up to secondary level and making textbook copies available online to resolve the textbook crisis. The government formed the 15-member committee on Mar 9, to resolve the textbook crisis, headed by Mohammad Akhtaruzzaman, professor of Islamic history at Dhaka University. Akhtaruzzaman and committee member Syed Manzurul Islam, of the DU English department, submitted a report to the education ministry on Sunday. "We will realise the recommendations after reviewing the report," education minister Nurul Islam Nahid said after receiving the report. "There are many problems outlined in the report for which necessary steps will be taken," he said. Asked about not implementing recommendations submitted to the ministry in the past, Nahid said, "As we have formed the committee, we must realise its recommendations." Akhtaruzzaman said, "It will be a great task if textbooks are made available to students free of cost at secondary level as they are for primary level." The committee also recommended recasting the National Curriculum and Textbook Board in addition to decentralising it. It said skilled people should be fully appointed to the board instead of appointments on deputation. "An institution becomes strong if it has its own manpower," said Akhtaruzzaman. Sectors-based recommendations were also made in the report, he added. An education ministry official said the committee recommended following previous action plans regarding annual printing of textbooks, such as completing printing by Oct. 31 each year. The report also contained recommendations for strengthening monitoring of printing at divisional levels if possible. b
