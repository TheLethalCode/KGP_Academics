 NEW DELHI, Apr 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The following is a snapshot of recent developments in India's general election campaign. (The sources are mentioned in brackets). Bharatiya Janata Party chief L.K. Advani, said if voted to power his government would examine all aspects of the India-US nuclear deal signed last year, but would not cancel it. (Hindustan Times) The BJP had opposed the deal and sought a no-confidence vote last year against the Congress party-led coalition to block it. India's communists, who walked out on the coalition following differences over the deal, has said it will "review" the deal if voted to power. The leader of AIADMK, a top party in southern India, has backed Sharad Pawar, the chief of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), for the post of prime minister. (Hindustan Times) Pawar is part of the Congress-led coalition, but could join the Third Front, a loose alliance of regional parties and the communists, if the grouping does well in the election. Pawar harbours prime ministerial aspirations and the backing of AIADMK chief J. Jayalalithaa could leave the Congress uncomfortable. It could also pose problems for the Third Front leadership which already is grappling with the problem of too many claimants for the PM's job. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh says he is confident that the Congress-led coalition will be returned to power, but says he is open on the question of post-poll alliances. "I am not ruling out or ruling in...anything," he said on Monday. (The Asian Age
