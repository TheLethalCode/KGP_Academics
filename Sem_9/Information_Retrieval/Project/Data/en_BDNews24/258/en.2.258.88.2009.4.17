 LONDON, April 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bundesliga side Hamburg SV were beaten 2-1 at Manchester City in their UEFA Cup quarter-finals, second leg on Thursday but survived a second-half siege to hang on for a 4-3 aggregate victory. Martin Jol's in-form side, who impressed in a 3-1 victory last week, had a dream start when Paolo Guerrero punished some slack City defending to leave the hosts a daunting task. However, the Dutchman who was sacked by Tottenham Hotspur last season despite two consecutive fifth-place finishes in the Premier League, was made to sweat as City hit back with a fortunate Elano penalty five minutes later and a Felipe Caicedo shot after the break. Elano twice hit the woodwork with swerving free kicks and Caicedo had a goal ruled out for offside as City swarmed all over Hamburg in the second half, even after having Richard Dunne sent off for a second yellow card. One more goal would have sent the tie into extra time but Hamburg just about did enough to book a semi-final against northern neighbours Werder Bremen. "We were the better team at home and I feel we were the better team here in the first half," Jol told ITV Sport. "The penalty was a bit harsh and gave them a way back. "I was worried because I thought we needed another goal but luckily they didn't get the third." City's exit increases the pressure on manager Mark Hughes who is due to meet the club's billionaire Abu Dhabi owners on Friday, although his side produced a gutsy display. "I'm proud of their performance," Hughes told ITV. "We kept on probing and putting pressure on their back four and they couldn't handle it." Guerrero slotted Hamburg ahead after Dunne's failure to deal with a low cross. City levelled when Piotr Trochowski was harshly adjudged to have handled in the area and Elano converted the spot kick. Elano sent a fierce free kick against the crossbar as City took a grip and five minutes after the break Caicedo fired the home side in front from just inside the area. It was all City after the break with Elano hitting the post and Robinho twice being denied by Hamburg keeper Frank Rost
