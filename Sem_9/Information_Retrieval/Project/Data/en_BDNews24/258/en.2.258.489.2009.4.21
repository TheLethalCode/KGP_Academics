 Cox's Bazar, Apr 21 (bdnews24.com)  Myanmar's border guards Nasaka has started constructing an earthen weir within 80 gauges of zero point ignoring objections from Bangladesh Rifles. Construction started along the border pillar 20 of the Palongkhali Rahmater Bill area under Ukhiya Upazila at 10am Monday. Members of the armed forces of Myanmar and local Rakhain youths are assisting Nasaka, said locals of the sparsely populated area. Major Tanim Hossain of Cox's Bazar-based 17 Rifles Battalion said written complaints were lodged after Nasaka ignored several verbal protests from BDR, but they were continuing with the work. "They are doing this to put up barbed-wire fencing," he said. There are around 40 BDR members at the Palongkhali Anjuman Para BOP but they are inactive as no orders came from the high-ups, a bdnews24.com correspondent said by phone. Asked, Major Tanim said the matter has been conveyed to the higher authority and a discussion will be held on Tuesday. Palongkhali Union Parishad chairman Mazharul Anwar Chowdhury Sifat said the Bill area was inhabited by around 1200 people. "They are living in constant fear due to the weir construction activities in the border areas," he said. bdnews2
