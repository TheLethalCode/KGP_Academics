 Dhaka, April 18 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh Football Federation has decided to make the Bangladesh football team's jersey popular among the countrymen selling some 1,000 shirts before the start of the AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers this month in Dhaka. "We see many football fans in the country walk around wearing an AC Milan, Manchester United or Chelsea jersey and we think it is the right time to give them a chance to wear a Bangladesh jersey too," BFF general secretary Al Musabbir Sadi told reporters in his office on Saturday. Sadi, however, said that it was a part of promotional activities to keep the fans talking about the football team. Bangladesh have been pitted in Group A with Myanmar, Cambodia and Macao and the group champions will qualify for the final round. The BFF has also taken some decisions to attract fans into the big bowl by releasing 50,000 leaflets in the city as well as putting up five billboards at vital points in the city. They are Farmgate, Motijheel, Tatibazar, Kakoli (Banani) and Jatrabari. A two-horse caravan will also be used to drum up publicity for the tournament especially in the old part of Dhaka. The BFF has also plan to stage a street play on football just a day before the tournament gets started, said the new BFF general secretary. The federation also may hire two big TVC screens in the city. bd
