<TITLE> Package will frustrate garment exporters: FBCCI </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 19 (bdnews24.com)The apex business body has said the financial package the government rolled out Sunday to tackle immediate impact of global economic downturn will upset readymade garment exporters. The FBCCI president, Annisul Huq, himself an RMG exporter, said it would be better if the package raised cash incentives for the export-focused sector. "It is hard to find what we understand as stimulus in the context of the global recession in the package announced by the finance minister," he told bdnews24.com in an instant reaction. It was not similar to stimulus packages announced by different countries to deal with the immediate aftermaths of the global recession, Huq added. Finance minister AMA Muhith unveiled the government's much-anticipated stimulus package earlier in the day, amounting to Tk 3,424 crore for the current fiscal year. This will go to increase subsidies in power and agriculture and raise the rate of cash incentives for recession-hit exporters in the remaining few months of FY 2008-09. Huq described the package as one for overall economic programme of the government. He, however, said the increased cash incentives for exports of jute and leather goods and frozen foods would help these sectors to overcome the losses. The Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industries chief thanked the government for 'a positive step for the economy' and stressed on fast implementation of the pledges by the government. bdn
