 WASHINGTON, Apr 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai on Sunday said US efforts to tame the growing Taliban insurgency through negotiations would fail unless his government agreed to such talks. The Obama administration has announced it will send more troops and economic assistance to Afghanistan as well as intensify diplomacy within the region in a bid to counter the Taliban, who now control large parts of the Asian nation. But in an interview with CNN, Karzai objected to the strategy of having US military commanders in Afghanistan conduct direct talks with Taliban members in order to persuade them to abandon their struggle and join local militias. "If you want to accomplish a local deal with a certain Taliban commander at a tactical level, good enough," the Afghan leader told CNN's "GPS" program.

The United States is deploying an additional 17,000 troops to reinforce the roughly 70,000 international troops already in Afghanistan. NATO leaders also have agreed to boost troops levels by 3,000 to provide security ahead an August 20 election. Karzai, who has ruled the multiethnic nation since the Taliban's ouster, won the 2004 presidential election. The United States has said that it will not back him or any other candidate in the upcoming poll. The Afghan leader also said his government would change a law critics said legalized rape within marriage for Shia Muslims, saying he was unaware of the provision when it was passed. President Barack Obama called the measure, which prevented women from declining a husband's request for sexual intercourse, abhorrent
