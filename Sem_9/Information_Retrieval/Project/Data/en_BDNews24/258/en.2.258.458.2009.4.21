<TITLE> No funny business, pledges Sarker as new NSC chief </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 21 (bdnews24.com) - State Minister for Youth and Sports Ahad Ali Sarker has been appointed the chairman of the National Sports Council. "I know that the NSC deals with crores of money and I assure you that I won't go to prison on the charge of embezzlement," said the minister on Tuesday. A government handout earlier in the day stated that the resignation letter of General Moeen U Ahmed was accepted by the president and Ahad was appointed in his place. The move came just a day after army chief Moeen resigned from the post of national sports council and its executive committee chairman following a controversy over a football sponsorship deal. The presence of Moeen in the signing on April 13 of a Tk 4.5 crore three-year sponsorship deal between Bangladesh Football Federation and Bashundhara Group, headed by Ahmed Akbar Sobhan, better known as Shah Alam, who is facing corruption charges, touched off the controversy. Alam was indicted during an anti-corruption campaign launched by the two-year rule of the military-installed government. The campaign, it was widely perceived, was spearheaded by Gen Moeen. Moeen took over as the NSC chairman in a presidential order on July 8, 2007 during the caretaker government. Meanwhile, the NSC chairmanship is a traditional prerogative of the sports ministry. "According to custom, this post is mine and I came back to my place. The army chief assumed this post in a process," Sarker told reporters after being appointed. Meanwhile, a task force which was formed during the caretaker government found more than Tk 80 crore misappropriated. The sports minister assured that there would be no misappropriation in his five-year tenure. bdnew
