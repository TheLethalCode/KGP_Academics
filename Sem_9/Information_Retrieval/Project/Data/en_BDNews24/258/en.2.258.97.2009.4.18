 SOUTH AFRICA, Apr 17 (bdnews24.com)  New Zealand wicketkeeper-batsman Brendon McCullum will lead the Kolkata Knight Riders for the second season of the IPL, which begins on Saturday in South Africa, according to cricinfo.com. He has replaced former India captain Sourav Ganguly, who led Kolkata during the first season of the IPL. The move has cleared some doubt regarding the multiple-captain theory proposed by Kolkata coach John Buchanan. The team had been using different captains in each of their practice games in South Africa, but it is now clear the strategy has been done away with. "Prior to coming here there was obviously some speculation about the multi-captains," Buchanan said. "We've appointed Brendon, who is very happy about it. He has the support of Sourav Ganguly, Brad Hodge and Chris Gayle as senior members and obviously Matthew Mott as team coach." McCullum will also keep wicket and open the batting. "I'm immensely proud to have been named Kolkata Knight Riders captain. It's a tremendous honour," he said."We've got some quality players in our line-up and I will be looking to use the skills and expertise of Sourav, Brad and Chris throughout the tournament. "We've trained hard and we've put big expectations on ourselves and we hope to deliver and push the boundaries towards the end of the tournament, and hopefully be in the semi-finals and finals." Buchanan said the decision was taken in the best interests of the team. "I'm sure there'll be the odd objection to it, but hopefully the fans will understand that what we are trying to do is the best for them, the best for the franchise and the best for Sourav. We don't make these decisions lightly." Ganguly is the third captain to have lost the captaincy after the IPL's first season. VVS Laxman was the first to go when the Deccan Chargers appointed Adam Gilchrist to lead the side, followed by Rahul Dravid making way for Kevin Pietersen at the helm for the Bangalore Royal Challengers. Kolkata will play their first game against Deccan on Sun
