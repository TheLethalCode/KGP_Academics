 BANGKOK, Tue Apr 21, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thailand's government will face more protests if it presses ahead with a crackdown on the red-shirt movement allied to former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, an opposition strategist said on Tuesday. "The government needs to stop hunting protesters right now and show that it respects the people's rights," Chaturon Chaisang, a former minister in the Thaksin administration ousted in a 2006 coup, told Reuters. Police arrested three leaders of the pro-Thaksin United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD) last week after the government imposed emergency rule to end street protests that have distracted its handling of an economy heading for recession. Another nine UDD protesters in the northern city of Chiang Rai, a former stronghold of Thaksin's banned political party, surrendered to police on Tuesday. Police have issued arrest warrants for nearly 30 other UDD leaders and supporters they say were involved in protests that forced the cancellation of a summit of Asian leaders and a three-week siege of the seat of government in Bangkok. Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva said his government was consulting with Asian leaders on a new date for the East Asia Summit, which officials said could be held in June on the southern resort island of Phuket far from the restive capital. [nBKK487674] "We need to make our partners feel confident that they can meet safely," Abhisit told reporters after a cabinet meeting. The protests, which left two people dead and more than 100 injured, were hugely embarrassing for Abhisit, who has tried to present an image of stability since taking power four months ago. He has said emergency rule in Bangkok, now in its 10th day, will stay until he is sure the red shirts have abandoned their protests. Other UDD leaders have vowed to fight on. They have called for a series of rallies outside Bangkok, starting on Saturday with a demonstration in the province of Samut Sakhon, which is not under emergency rule. "The UDD will not back down," said Somyos Prueksakasemsuk, a political activist who protested against the 2006 coup and calls himself a "second generation" UDD leader. EXPORTS FALL AGAIN The latest political unrest comes as Thailand's economy teeters of the brink of recession. The latest export figures released on Tuesday showed a sharp drop for the fifth month in March and analysts warned the outlook was bleak. While calm has returned to Bangkok, where emergency rule has had little impact on daily life, the divide between Thailand's royalist elite and middle classes who oppose Thaksin and his backers among the urban and rural poor remains as deep as ever. Moody's Investors Services said on Monday prolonged political unrest would weaken Thailand's fundamentals and its economic prospects. "Although the army has regained control of Bangkok, last Friday's assassination attempt on one of the leaders of the royalist and anti-Thaksin People's Alliance for Democracy underscores the fluidity and dangers of the political situation in Thailand," Moody's analyst Thomas Byrne said. He was referring to the attack on PAD founder Sondhi Limthongkul, who remains in hospital recovering from head injuries suffered when gunmen sprayed his car with automatic rifle fire and triggered fears of more political violence. Police initially said they were hunting for five suspects, but they have since rolled back and said only that their investigation was making prog
