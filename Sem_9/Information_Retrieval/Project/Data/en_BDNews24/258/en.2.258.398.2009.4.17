 Dhaka, Apr 17 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina warned her Awami League supporters Friday against "extravagance", reminding them they could not duck the people's verdict. "Our time is not smooth, but we must move forward. Awami League has a history of struggle and sacrifice, not of extravagance," she said at a discussion to mark Mujibnagar Day. "It has been seen in this general election what happens to those who want to indulge in extravagance when in power," she said. Hasina reaffirmed her government's maximum efforts to ease power and water crises and sought a bit more time. "We know what pains the people are going through. We're trying." "[But] its not possible to reach a solution to power crisis in a short time. More power needs to be generated and national grid will have to be expanded. To this we need time," Hasina said. The prime minister said the power generation did not increase in the last seven years. "What did they [those in state power] do?" She said the Dec. 29 national polls were a revolution. "[We] will have to respect the people's trust and confidence in us." The gathering was organised by Awami League at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre to mark the day that independent Bangladesh' first interim government was formed. The government-in-exile, which came to be known as the Mujibnagar Government, took oath in a quiet mango grove of Baidyanathtola in Meherpur in 1971. bdnews2
