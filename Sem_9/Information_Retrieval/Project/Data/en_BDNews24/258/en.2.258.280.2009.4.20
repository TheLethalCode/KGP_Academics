<TEXT>
 CAPE TOWN, April 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - West Indies fast bowler Fidel Edwards gave away just six runs in his four overs to lift Deccan Chargers to an eight-wicket win over Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League on Sunday. Virender Sehwag's unbeaten 38 off 16 balls helped the Delhi Daredevils to a 10-wicket victory over King's XI Punjab in a rain-affected first game of the day. The match was delayed by almost two hours and reduced to 12 overs per side before rain again intervened, leaving the Daredevils a target of 54 in six overs. Sehwag made a mockery of the run chase to secure victory with seven balls to spare. The King's XI appeared set for more than their final total of 104 for seven after an opening stand of 67 in six overs between Karam Goel (38) and England's Ravi Bopara (22). But New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori's canny left-arm spin applied the handbrake and earned him figures of three for 15 in three overs. The Kolkata Knight Riders struggled to 101 all out in increasingly bowler-friendly conditions against Deccan. Aside from Edwards's remarkable figures, which included a maiden over, Rudra Pratap Singh claimed four for 22. DAMP SURROUNDINGS Only Australian Brad Hodge came to terms with a pitch offering pace and seam movement in damp surroundings, scoring 31 from 34 balls. As tricky as batting was towards the end of the fourth match in two days on the same pitch, Herschelle Gibbs was equal to the task on what has been his home ground for 20 years. He guided the Chargers home with an unbeaten 43 from 26 deliveries to secure victory with 41 balls to spare. The opening weekend of fixtures produced victories for three of last season's worst performing franchises with Mumbai Indians, Bangalore Royal Challengers and Deccan Chargers all victorious after finishing in the bottom four last year. Champions Rajasthan Royals are bottom of the table after losing to Bangalore on Saturday. The second edition of the IPL was moved out of India due to security concerns and logical issues surrounding the general elections currently being held in that country
