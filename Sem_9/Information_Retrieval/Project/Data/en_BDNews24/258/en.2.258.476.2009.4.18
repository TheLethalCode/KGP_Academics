 Dhaka, April 18 (bdnews24.com) - All disciplines of South Asian Games in Bangladesh have been asked to trim their respective squads before the start of the second-phase training this month. The directive came on Saturday during the BOA training and development committee meeting presided over by its chairman and BOA vice-president Mizanur Rahman. As many as 23 disciplines will be showcased in the 2010 SA Games and over 700 athletes from different disciplines have been training from January. The meeting also emphasised the need for foreign coaches before the start of the final-phase training and asked the respective federations to finalise foreign coaches in a bid to go for resolute training. "We have directed the federations to go for more intensive training from this month and for that, it is important to cut the number of athletes in the ongoing camp," said Manu. The training committee head, however, said that 16 disciplines out of 23 had almost finalised their squads for the second-phase training. BOA vice-president and chairman of the SA Games technical committee Sirajul Islam Bachchu, member secretary of training committee Anisur Rahman Dipu and director & CEO Col (retd) M Wali Ullah were also present. bd
