 Dhaka, Apr 19 (bdnews24.com)  The government is set to form an investigation body and prosecution cell for the trial of 1971 war crimes, said the state minister for home on Sunday. Home minister Sahara Khatun and law minister Shafiq Ahmed, among other members of the government committee on war crimes, were sitting on Sunday evening to finalise members of the investigation and prosecution teams for the trials. The group sat from 6.15pm at the residence of the law minister, and adjourned at around 8pm to convene again the following day, said state minister for home Tanjim Ahmed who was also present. He said up to seven investigators and five prosecutors would be announced in a joint press conference of the law and home ministers. Tanjim said the investigating team would comprise former or serving members of existing investigation agencies. Asked on what criteria they were being picked, he said, "We will choose them on the basis of their patriotism, experience and qualifications." Chaired by the law minister Sunday's meeting was also attended by the state minister for law Kamrul Islam, additional attorney general Inayetur Rahim, home secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikder, law secretary Kazi Habibul Awal and lawyers Mosharraf Hossain Kajol and Annisul Haque.
