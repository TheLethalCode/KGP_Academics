<TITLE> Australia's Rudd beats a path to big government </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CANBERRA, Apr 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Like a good investor, Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd sees opportunity amid financial tumult, but in his case the prize seems to be repositioning government as the country's main driver. Since September Rudd has promised close to $58 billion, or two percent of GDP, in cash and guarantees to beat a coming recession, and this month pledged a $30 billion super broadband to link the nation, with the state as its majority owner. "The new, super-fast national broadband network is the single largest nation-building project in Australia's history," Rudd said, promising it would be bigger than a 1950s scheme re-shaping Australia's alps to water the arid southeast with snow-melt. Rudd seems to be using the onset of global market failure to put into practice his long-held view that governments should play a more central role in the economy. As governments battle the global financial crisis, Rudd is not alone in doling out government funds in the hope of boosting economic demand and limiting job losses. U.S. President Barack Obama has promised an economic stimulus of $787 billion, Britain has nationalised ailing banks and the recent G20 meeting of major economies in London pledged $1.1 trillion to jump-start the global economy. But Australia's stimulus spending is large for the size of its economy. At 2 percent of GDP it equals U.S. discretionary spending in 2009 and outstrips that of Britain and France. Rudd has also guaranteed Australia's entire banking deposit base of A$600-A$700 billion for three years and wholesale bank funding, while promising to plug a A$75 billion shortfall in corporate funding if loan-averse foreign banks pull out. And after guaranteeing bank deposits, Rudd corralled the country's four big banks to aid the car-retail industry, with loan funding worth A$2 billion. RUDD'S POLITICAL RISK But the big government agenda carries risks, through a return to big borrowing in a country that has run budget surpluses for a decade and where voters view deficits with suspicion. The government in February forecast a deficit of A$35.5 billion ($24.8 billion) by June next year, a few months out from an expected national election due by late 2010. Some expect cumulative debt in coming years to top A$200 billion. Conservative opponents have leapt on the possibility. In advertisements featuring an image of two tiny feet, they warn parents of newborn babies that their child had inherited "ten little toes from Mum and Dad, A$9,500 debt from Kevin Rudd". Rudd eulogised the controversial 1970s record of Australia's last big government champion, former Labor prime minister Gough Whitlam, calling him "our very own Pericles", even though Whitlam was dumped for economic incompetence. Australians have now begun to wonder what next from a man whose infatuation with government runs so deep that his schoolboy hobbies included reading transcripts of parliamentary debate. The current slowdown will likely bring a shift from private spending towards social services like health and education, traditionally steered by government, respected University of Queensland economist John Quiggin argued this month. Australians, like Europeans, have always supported a central role for government in welfare, health, education and even employment, but on its scope they sit somewhere between Stockholm and Paris at one end, and Washington at the other. During his 2007 election race Rudd tilted the bar further to the Seine, suggesting a national takeover of state-controlled public hospitals if state governments would not adopt his national plan to boost health care levels. A government-backed review in the middle of this year is expected to stop short of that and suggest only stronger central oversight, health industry sources told Reuters. That will be good news to wary private hospital operators like Ramsay Health Care Ltd, as well as the states. At the same time Rudd will in the May 12 budget announce funding worth A$10 billion for road, rail, port and other infrastructure improvement, possibly involving more broadband-style public-private partnerships. Construction and property firms like Lend Lease and Leighton, along with building materials groups such as Boral and CSR, can hardly wait as they look to ride out a coming recession with the government's help. Rudd's sweeping victory over conservatives in 2007 was also pinned on an "education revolution", with the focus so far on stimulative spending to improve school facilities, rather than on the quality of teaching that education experts have called for. Extra training places will come in the budget, which Rudd already hints will contain a third economic stimulus worth as much as A$10-15 billion, building on earlier cash handouts for families and pensioners. Much of that will ride on infrastructure spending. "NEO-LIBERALISM FAILED" "The great neo-liberal experiment of the past 30 years has failed. Neoliberalism and the free-market fundamentalism it has produced, has been revealed as little more than personal greed dressed up as an economic philosophy," Rudd wrote in an essay penned over his summer break, earning the nickname "Comrade Rudd" from newspapers. But it is with April's shock decision to junk a market tender and set up a new company, in which government will hold a 51 percent stake, to build and plug cutting-edge broadband into just about every home, that most marks Rudd's departure from a pre-election pledge to govern as an "economic conservative". Norman Abjorensen, who lectures in political science at the Australian National University, argues Rudd's brand of big government is not the radical departure others claim it to be. "In the United States, government is quite often seen as the enemy of private enterprise, but Australia is quite the opposite. Here people tend to look to governments for solutions," he said. Abjorensen said successive surveys show Australians are prepared to fork out more money for government coffers if it leads to better government services, and they support government ownership. That should help Rudd avoid a ballot backlash. But Gerard Henderson of the Sydney Institute think tank said that while Rudd does not share his hero Whitlam's indifference to economic reality, his broadband project shows as much bravado as Whitlam before he was ousted in a 1975 constitutional crisis. "The prime minister is demonstrating his belief in government high up on a rope and without a safety net. Let's hope he makes it," Henderson wrote
