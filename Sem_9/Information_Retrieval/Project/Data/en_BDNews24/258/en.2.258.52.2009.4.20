<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 20 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court asked the government on Monday to explain why it would not be ordered to ban the series of books styled 'Documents on the War of Independence' that misrepresents history on the proclamation of Bangladesh's independence. It also directed the government to present in the final hearing the newspapers published between Mar 1 and Mar 25 in 1971 and preserved in national archives. The 2001-2006 BNP-Jamaat-e-Islami coalition government published the books in June 2004. The bench of justices ABM Khairul Haque and Md Momtaz Uddin Ahmed also ordered the government to explain why it should not be asked to take legal action against those who distorted history on the declaration of independence by publishing the 15-volume book. The orders came on a writ petition filed by Dr MA Salam, a freedom fighter, on Sunday as a public interest litigation. Manzill Musrhid, the lawyer for the petitioner, served a legal notice on April 13 on the government to ban the books by Apr 15. The cabinet secretary, president's secretary, the prime minister's secretary, information secretary, home secretary, director of the publication and owner of the publication project and owner of Priyanka Printing and Publication have been asked to reply in three weeks. Morshed said Sunday the government commissioned a committee on Feb 13, 1979 to write and publish the history on war of independence from Pakistan. The committee published the history in November 1982 and reprinted it in December 2003 where it was said that the war of independence was declared by Mujibnagar government-in-exile on April 10, 1971. It clearly said independence hero Sheikh Mujibur Rahman declared independence of Bangladesh on Mar 26, 1971, Morshed said. The BNP government decided to reprint the war history and thrust pro-BNP intellectuals into the reformed committee. And, the liberation war ministry changed the part 'Declaration of Independence' in the third volume when it was reprinted in June 2004 which said major Ziaur Rahman, BNP's founder, declared independence, the lawyer said in the legal notice. He said those who twisted the national history had committed offence against the state and violated the constitution. The petition also appealed to confiscate the books. bdne
