 Colombo, Apr 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least 5,000 people burst out of Sri Lanka's tiny war zone on Monday, after soldiers broke through a long earthen wall the Tamil Tiger rebels built to stall their advance, the military said. The wall of earth had blocked the widest land link to the coastal strip where Sri Lanka's military has surrounded the Tigers with the goal of crushing them and ending a civil war that has raged since 1983 and is now Asia's longest-running. "Troops captured the earth bund and so far 5,000 people have been rescued. It is still going on," military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara said. The no-fire zone is a 17-square-km area of coconut groves, where the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) separatists are fighting their last stand from among tens of thousands of civilians they have held there by force. The Sri Lankan government has been under heavy Western pressure to call a ceasefire to protect people in the no-fire zone, since the LTTE has rejected all international calls to let them go and insists civilians are staying by choice. Sri Lanka has rejected further calls for a truce after the expiration of a 48-hour pause last week, saying the Tigers only used it to bolster their defences and make it harder for people to escape. The state-run Daily News said 15,000 people had fled on Monday, which Nanayakkara denied. However, military sources told Reuters that the number was likely to climb later in the day, and that the 5,000 figure given only represented those people who had been checked and cleared by soldiers for onward passage to refugee camps. Anyone approaching military lines has to be screened for weapons or bombs, since an LTTE suicide bomber in February blew herself up at a refugee screening centre and killed at least 28 and wounded nearly 100.
