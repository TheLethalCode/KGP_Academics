<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 20 (bdnews24.com)Khaleda Zia, widow of slain army chief-turned-president Ziaur Rahman, was served an official notice Monday to vacate the 6 Moinul Road residence in Dhaka Cantonment, said party officials. Speaking to reporters in the evening, a BNP official dismissed the notice to the main opposition BNP chief, and questioned its validity. "This has no legal basis," said joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan. "This is purely political vendetta." Khan said they were consulting legal experts and senior party leaders. He also said BNP's ongoing protests against the government's decision to cancel the lease on the house would continue. Shamsur Rahman Shimul Biswas, private secretary to the BNP chairperson, earlier told bdnews24.com that several Cantonment Board officials handed the notice to the caretaker at the mansion. He said the former prime minister was with her lawyers at her Gulshan office in the afternoon. Caretaker Muhammad Yunus also confirmed receipt of the notice to bdnews24.com. "The Cantonment Board officials delivered the letter at around 3.30pm today." 'Let the courts decide' BNP has said it will only accept a court verdict on the fate of the party chief's lease on the cantonment residence. "We will accept whatever verdict the court gives on the cabinet decision to cancel the lease of the cantonment house," said BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, addressing a protest rally earlier in the week. "The country is beset with limitless problems ... But the government is up in arms about the cantonment house," he said. "Well, we will leave the issue to be decided by the courts," he said BNP has been protesting since the cabinet's April 8 decision to cancel Khaleda's lease on the cantonment house, given after her husband was killed in a military coup. "The cabinet decision to cancel the lease was wrong and the government should approach the court to settle the issue," said Delwar. The government, meanwhile, has said it will lawfully quell any move to create unrest over the cabinet decision. Decision to give notice The Zia family has been living in the cantonment house since the 1970s. The 2.72-acre mansion was originally the official home of the army chief, a position held by then the Lt Gen Zia. The government has argued that since Khaleda was given a second house, on a 1.5-bigha plot in Gulshan, the allotment of the 9-bigha cantonment house should be cancelled. It also said the house was leased out to Khaleda for 99 years with some conditions including restrictions on political activities in the house. Sheikh Hasina told parliament at the start of the month that she would ask the opposition leader to vacate the house and that blocks of apartments would be built in the prime land for families of army officers killed in the February BDR mutiny. "No member of parliament, no leader of the opposition, should live in the cantonment," Hasina had said. Hasina has also said the cantonment authorities allocated the house to Khaleda violating Cantonment Board laws. Reaction Responding to the development, a US embassy official said there were "many important issues facing Bangladesh." "This is an issue for Bangladesh to resolve through dialogue and/or established legal procedure," a spokesperson for the US embassy in Dhaka told bdnews24.com. "There are many important issues facing Bangladesh. We hope the government and opposition will work together for the common good of the country," said the spokesperson
