 TEHRAN, April (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Iranian-American journalist accused in Iran of spying for the United States has been sentenced to eight years in jail, her lawyer said on Saturday, five days after she was put on trial. The jailing of Roxana Saberi could become a source of tension between Iran and the United States at a time when Washington is trying to reach out to the Islamic Republic following three decades of mutual mistrust. Iran's judiciary earlier this week said Saberi went on trial on Monday at a Revolutionary Court, which handles state security issues. "She has been sentenced to eight years ... I will appeal," lawyer Abdolsamad Khorramshahi told Reuters. The United States has called the charges against Saberi, a freelance reporter who has worked for the BBC and National Public Radio, "baseless and without foundation" and demanded her immediate release. Saberi, 31, is a citizen of both the United States and Iran but Tehran does not recognize dual nationality. The judiciary was not available for comment on Saturday. Her case coincides with speculation of a possible thaw in U.S.-Iranian ties after U.S. President Barack Obama offered a new beginning of engagement if Tehran "unclenches its fist." Under Iran's penal code, espionage can carry the death penalty. The Islamic Republic last year executed an Iranian businessman convicted of spying on the military for Israel. Saberi, who was born in the United States, was arrested in January for working after her press credentials had expired. MISS NORTH DAKOTA Her parents visited her in Tehran's Evin jail on April 6, after arriving from the United States. Evin is a jail where rights groups say political prisoners are usually taken. According to a website set up to campaign for her release, freeroxana.net, Saberi is of Iranian and Japanese descent and moved to Iran six years ago. She grew up in Fargo, North Dakota, and holds Masters Degrees in Journalism and International Relations. She was chosen Miss North Dakota in 1997, the website says. Washington cut ties with Iran shortly after the Islamic revolution in 1979 but Obama's administration has offered talks with Iran to try and solve a row over Tehran's nuclear plans. Iran says it wants to see a real switch in Washington's policies away from those of former President George W. Bush, who led a drive to isolate the country because of nuclear work the West suspects has military aims, a charge Iran denies. On Thursday, the U.S. State Department said Tehran had formally informed Washington via Swiss interlocutors that Saberi had been put on trial. State Department spokesman Robert Wood raised questions about the transparency of Iran's judicial system. Switzerland represents U.S. interests in Iran as Tehran and Washington do not have diplomatic ties. Wood said a Swiss representative was not in the courtroom during Saberi's trial.
