 Dhaka, April 19 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has ordered 58 Islami Chhatra Shibir leaders and workers to surrender to a Rajshahi court within four weeks in connection with a case of campus violence at Rajshahi Medical College. A High Court bench of Justice Nazmun Ara Sultana and Justice Md Shamsul Huda gave the order on Sunday rejecting the anticipatory bail appeal of the 58 accused. The case was filed against 61 Shibir men, including the RMC branch president Abu Talha, at Rajpara Police Station by RMC's Bangladesh Chhatra League president Ashok Kumat Saha on March 15. The pro-Jamaat-e-Islami Shibir men were accused of beating up pro-Awami League BCL workers and ransacking their rooms at the medical college on March 10. A counter-case was filed by Talha at the Rajshahi Magistrate Court on March 22. Barrister Abdur Razzak represented the accused in the bail hearing. b
