<TITLE> Elephants kill three in Teknaf </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Cox's Bazar, Apr 21 (bdnews24.com)  A group of elephants killed three people, including two children, as they were collecting firewood in the Teknaf hills near the Myanmar border on Tuesday, said a local government official. The dead were identified as Fazal Ahmed (35), eight year-old Laila Begum and her seven year-old sister Kohinoor Akhtar from Boro Lechuaprong in Hila Union. "The elephants trampled them after knocking them over with their trunks," said Yunus Bengali, vice chairman of Teknaf Upazila. "Fazal and Laila were killed on the spot while Kohinoor died on the way to hospital at around 10:30am," he said. Yunus said all three were poor and made a living by selling firewood. "They went out at 7:30am as usual to collect wood in the hills and fell victims to the family of elephants," he said. All three bodies were buried without autopsy with permission from the Upazila administration, said the official. The incident has cast a shadow over the area, said Yunus. "People here are in shock." Elephant attacks have become more frequent in South Asia in recent years, as their forest habitats shrink due to encroachment by growing human populations and habitats, say conservationists. One of the world's most densely populated nations, Bangladesh's forest cover has shrunk to just 17.5 percent over past decades, with an estimated elephant population of 400, including 100 in captivity. The World Conservation Union says that an average of 40 people are killed each year by stray elephants in Bangladesh. bdn
