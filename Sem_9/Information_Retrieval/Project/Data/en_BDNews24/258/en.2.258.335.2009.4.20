<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 20 (bdnews24.com)State minister for law Kamrul Islam said Monday the government was yet to finalise the investigating and prosecuting teams for trial of 1971 war crimes. Law minister Shafiq Ahmed left for Tehran early morning for a conference of Muslim countries and international experts on efficient judicial processes to deal with war crimes and genocide in Gaza and other occupied territories, said Kamrul. The conference takes place from Apr 21-22, with Shafiq returning on the 24th, said Kamrul. "As soon as the law minister returns, we will finalise the investigating agency and prosecuting cell." The state ministers for law and home on Sunday, and home minister Sahara Khatun last week, had all given Monday as a likely date to announce the investigating and prosecuting teams for the much-awaited war crimes trials. "The trials are a momentous task, with involvement of state machinery. We don't want to rush anything, we must take time to get every step right," said Kamrul on Monday. The law minister had chaired a meeting up to late Sunday evening to finalise members of the two teams. The top-level meeting was attended by home minister Sahara Khatun, state minister for home Tanjim Ahmed, the state minister for law, additional attorney general Inayetur Rahim, home secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikder, law secretary Kazi Habibul Awal and lawyers Mosharraf Hossain Kajol and Anisul Haque. But it was adjourned without a final decision, said the state minister for home. Tanjim said up to seven investigators and five prosecutors were being considered. He said the investigation team would comprise former or serving members of existing agencies.
