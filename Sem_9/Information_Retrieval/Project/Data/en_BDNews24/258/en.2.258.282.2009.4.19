 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, April 19 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary committee on Sunday questioned communications minister Syed Abul Hossain's move to buy a luxury car costing over Tk 1 crore for his official use. The parliamentary standing committee on communications at a meeting also summoned former communication secretary Iqbal Mahmud who is accused of floating a tender to buy the costly car mentioning the minister's name. The incumbent communications secretary Ali Kabir admitted that mentioning the minister's name in the tender was a "wrong" decision. "One or two members raised the issue at the meeting," said Shaikh Muzibur Rahman, the committee chairman. "MP Golam Moula Roni raised the issue of buying a luxury car for the minister," committee member Nazrul Islam Monju told bdnews24.com "Under which authority did the ministry float a tender on car purchase mentioning the minister's name. Isn't this against the law?" Monju quoted Roni as asking at the meeting. Monju, the only opposition MP in the 10-member parliamentary watchdog, said the communications secretary admitted the mistake saying: "The ministry can buy cars. But we should not mention the minister's name in the tender". "Ali Kabir said his predecessor approved the file." "The secretary also said that the issue should be discussed in presence of the minister," said Monju Syed Abul Hossain is now in China. "We have asked the former secretary to be present again at our next meeting to clarify the issue," Shaikh Muzibur Rahman told bdnews24.com. "Some committee members talked about the car purchase for the minister," Omor Faruk Chowdhury, another committee member, told bdnews24.com. Roni raised the car purchase issue as the media had reported that the minister visited a car showroom to choose a luxury car for his use. Media reports also said the minister had instructed huge spending to decorate his ministry office.
