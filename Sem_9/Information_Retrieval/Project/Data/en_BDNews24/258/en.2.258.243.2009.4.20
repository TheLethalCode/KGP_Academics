 JERUSALEM, Mon Apr 20, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday he had not made Palestinian recognition of Israel as a Jewish state a precondition for opening peace negotiations. Comments last week on the issue by a senior official in the Prime Minister's Office led many media outlets in Israel to report that Netanyahu had set those terms for holding talks with Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Palestinians said at the time that Netanyahu, on a collision course with Washington over his reluctance to commit to Palestinian statehood, raised a new demand to try to avoid entering a serious negotiating process.

Visiting Israel and the occupied West Bank last week, US President Barack Obama's Middle East envoy, George Mitchell, said he would vigorously pursue the creation of a Palestinian state, setting the stage for possible conflict with Netanyahu. Netanyahu has pledged to hold talks with the Palestinians on economic, security and diplomatic issues but has made no public promise to negotiate statehood. Palestinian leaders have rejected any notion of an "economic peace" and have said U.S.-backed talks with Israel could not resume until Netanyahu committed to statehood. His far-right foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, has said talks on a Palestinian state launched at a 2007 conference in Annapolis, Maryland had reached a "dead
