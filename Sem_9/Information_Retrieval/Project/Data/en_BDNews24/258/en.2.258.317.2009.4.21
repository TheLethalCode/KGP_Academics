 Dhaka, April 21 (bdnews24.com)Markets finished downbeat Tuesday driven by banks mainly, as investors locked in profits. The country's bourses had seen previously gains for six straight trading days, riding on a surge in bank shares. Almost 60 percent of the traded scrips fell on Tuesday, though non-ban financial institutions continued to rally and mutual funds joined them following Monday's losses. Insurers ended mixed while power, energy and textile shares slipped. Market experts said that investors had opted for banks in recent days, in a bid to reap profits as their prices fell unusually low prior to last week's gains. "Banks' recent lower-than-usual prices caused investors to bet on them," former DSE chief executive Salahuddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com. The hype in banks, which account for more than 50 percent of the market capitalisation, was inevitably followed by 'hurried' profit taking, said Ahmed who teaches finance at the University of Dhaka. He said this was anticipated as investors' confidence in the market is still low overall. Meanwhile, turnover on the twin bourses managed to remain more or less steady. Dhaka stocks saw shares worth Tk 5.42 billion changing hands, edging down from Monday's Tk 5.42 billion. Turnover on the port city's bourse reached Tk 788.845 million, slightly up from 775.933 million the previous day.

Losers beat gainers 135 to 101 while seven issues held steady. Summit Power emerged as the turnover leader with shares worth Tk 390.543 million changing hands. It slipped 3.20 percent to Tk 1141.25.
