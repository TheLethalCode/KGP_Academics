 HYDERABAD, Mon Apr 20, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tech Mahindra Ltd, which is taking over Satyam Computer Services Ltd in a deal worth about $580 million, said on Monday it would run the fraud-hit outsourcing firm as a standalone unit. The buyers of the company at the centre of India's biggest corporate fraud said their priority was keeping customers and winning back lost business, but said it was too early to talk about possible job cuts. "On reaction of customers so far, I don't believe this is a sinking ship, no longer. This may not be a racing car yet. That is our task to make it one," Tech Mahindra chairman Anand Mahindra told a news conference at Satyam's headquarters in Hyderabad. Tech Mahindra, 31 percent owned by Britain's BT Group BT, was the highest bidder for a controlling stake in Satyam at an auction last week, a deal that will see it step up to the top tier of Indian IT firms.

"This is highest on our priority, retaining our existing clients. That should not be taken as a given because there was certain uncertainty about the future of Satyam and its financial viability," said Vineet Nayyar, chief executive of Tech Mahindra. Satyam, which counts Citigroup Inc, Cisco Systems Inc and General Electric among its clients, has not reported results since releasing its July-September figures in October. Its accounts are in the process of being restated. On possible layoffs at Satyam, which had about 48,000 staff at the end of the March quarter, Nayyar said Tech Mahindra would look at all the options and laying off people would be the last. The combined entity will have about 73,000 staff and Tech Mahindra - a unit of tractor and utility vehicle maker Mahindra & Mahindra - will become India's fourth-largest outsourcing firm from a current ranking of s
