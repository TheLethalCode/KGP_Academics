 Seoul, Apr 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - North Korea's army issued a fresh warning to the South on Saturday not to join a U.S-led initiative against the flow of weapons, saying it would be considered an act of war. North Korea has expelled international inspectors and threatened to restart its nuclear plant after being chastised by the United Nations for a rocket launch, which many see as a disguised long-range missile test. South Korea, which already angered the communist neighbour by ending its unconditional aid, is expected to join the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) in a move that could cut into the North's international arms business. Pyongyang's official news agency KCNA quoted a spokesman for the General Staff of the Korean People's Army as saying Seoul's move to join PSI was tantamount to "a declaration of undisguised confrontation and a declaration of a war". It said the North's army would increase defence capability including nuclear deterrent, without being limited by agreements from previous international disarmament talks. "(South Korea) should never forget that Seoul is just 50 km away from the Military Demarcation Line," it said.
