<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 16 (bdnews24.com)Squally winds and rainfall was sweeping over coastal areas, while sea ports were asked to raise local warning signal number four on Thursday evening as cyclonic storm Bijli, the first of the season, gained force over the Bay. Fishing boats and trawlers over the north Bay and deep sea were advised to take shelter immediately and remain in shelter until further notice, the met office said in a bulletin. The sea was very rough around the storm centre, it said. Movement of water vessels also remained suspended on inland routes. A deep depression over the southeast and central Bay of Bengal formed into cyclonic storm Bijli in the early hours. Brewing from around 3am, it moved north-eastwards over the west central and adjoining east central Bay through the day. The storm was centred about 735 km southwest of Chittagong port, 685 km southwest of Cox's Bazar port and 600 km south or southwest of Mongla port at around 6pm, said the weather office. Maximum sustained wind speed within 54 km of the cyclone centre was about 60km per hour rising to 80 km per hour in gusts or squalls. Bijli was likely to intensify further and move in a north and northeasterly direction, said the forecast. bdne
