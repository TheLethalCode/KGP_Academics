 CHISINAU, Tue Apr 21, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Moldova's ruling Communist party was again declared the winner on Tuesday in the ex-Soviet state's disputed parliamentary election in a recount ordered after violent protests against the initial result. Iurie Ciocan, Secretary of the Central Election Commission, said the results differed little from the original figures issued after the April 5 election giving the Communists just short of 50 percent of the vote.

He called for the recount after protesters denouncing the vote as rigged ransacked the president's offices and parliament. Voronin accused opposition parties of trying to stage a coup and said neighboring Romania had fomented the violence. But he said the recount could restore trust in the country of 4 million wedged between Ukraine and EU member Romania. Opposition parties, broadly pro-Romanian in outlook, said they would mount a legal challenge to the recount. "We, the three opposition parties, will challenge the result in the Chisinau Court of Appeal. We do not agree with it," said Nicolae Railean of the Our Moldova party.
