 CHENNAI, India, April 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Indian sports minister has criticised cricket captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and spinner Harbhajan Singh for not attending a function to receive a prestigious government award from the president this week. Both were in the country but did not travel to New Delhi on Tuesday to collect the Padma Shri award, given to Indian citizens excelling in various fields. Cricket-mad India is debating their attitude, days after praising the team for a successful tour of New Zealand. The sports ministry has re-issued a directive asking everyone to receive its annual awards in person and urging the interior ministry to issue a similar directive for its function. "I don't agree with the casualness by anyone. I deplore it," sports minister Manohar Singh Gill told the Times of India on Friday. "Selection for Padma award is the highest honour for any Indian and we are lucky if we get it and receive it from the president," he said.
