Chelsea captain John Terry should return to the side after missing the midweek Champions League aggregate victory over Liverpool through suspension. Everton manager David Moyes has an injury doubt over striker Louis Saha who has a stomach virus ahead of their FA Cup semi-final against Manchester United on Sunday (1500) Brazilian on-loan striker Jo is cup-tied but defender Joseph Yobo and striker James Vaughan have recovered and are in the squad.

However, strikers Roque Santa Cruz (knee) and Jason Roberts (foot) and midfielders Brett Emerton and Steven Reid (both knee) are all unavailable.
