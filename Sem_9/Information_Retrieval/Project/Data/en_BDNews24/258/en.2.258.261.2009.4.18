<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 18 (bdnews24.com)Cyclone Bijli turned into a land depression early Saturday morning after striking the Chittagong-Cox's Bazar coastline overnight with winds of up to 100 kph. The met office said the depression was moving in a northeasterly direction and would dissipate by afternoon. At least one person, a nine year-old boy, was killed in Pekua Upazila, Cox's Bazar, as the storm raged Friday night. Officials in the cyclone-hit district said Saturday morning it would take some time to assess the damage and any further death toll. Duty officer at the disaster ministry control cell, Syedul Islam, told bdnews24.com that solid preparations, including evacuations in the coastal belt, prevented casualties. Hundreds of thousands were evacuated from homes along the coastal belt of 11 districts. Except for the two southeastern districts of Chittagong and Cox's Bazar, Bijli left most of the coast relatively unscathed. "We don't expect to get news of many deaths," said Islam. "But there are reports coming in of damage to property and homes." "We will know more as the day goes on," he added. Chittagong deputy commissioner Fariduddin Chowdhury said there had been no deaths reported in the district up to Saturday 11am. Still packing winds Met department official Abdul Mannan said the depression was still packing moderate winds Saturday morning, causing rough seas along the Chittagong and Cox's Bazar coastline. The two maritime ports were asked to keep hoisted local cautionary signal number three. Chittagong seaport was up and running again from morning. Port official Syed Muhammad Farhaduddin said the jetties were open. "We hope all activities will be in full swing by afternoon," he told bdnews24.com. Chittagong airport, which had also been closed the previous night, was operating again from 8am. Nine-year old dies in treefall A boy of nine was killed in Cox's Bazar as Bijli bore down on Friday night. Pekua Upazila Nirbahi Officer Humayun Kabir said a tree fell on Abdur Rahim of East Jaliapara, killing him on the spot and injuring his sister Jamila Khatun, 12. Early reports from correspondents in Chittagong and Cox's Bazar said the storm, the first of the cyclone season, damaged thousands of mud-and-thatch houses and swathes of cropland, uprooting trees, and knocking out power and telephone lines. They said the damage was caused by strong winds sweeping the region, including offshore islands and chars, but there was little rainfall in the region after midnight. The southern coastal districts of Noakhali, Feni, Laxmipur and Bhola were also hit by moderate winds. The cyclone lost strength gradually after making landfall in the Chittagong region, met officials said. Blackout Parts of the resort district of Cox's Bazar and the port city of Chittagong were without power and telecommunications through the night. Authorities had shut down Chittagong seaport and airport, evacuated hundreds of thousands of people from the coastline and put emergency services on stand-by. Roaring in from the Bay of Bengal, the storm triggered high waves and a tidal surge that reached up to three metres above the normal level. More than 200,000 people were evacuated to shelters by Red Crescent volunteers in the Chittagong and Cox's Bazar districts, said bdnews24.com correspondents quoting local officials. Danger signal 7 Authorities had earlier raised danger signal 7 for busy Chittagong port, asked fishing boats to return to shore and put and law-enforcers on alert for any emergency, including a possible tidal surge, as the storm was forecast to hit the Chittagong-Cox's Bazar coastline by midnight. Cox's Bazar and Mongla ports had been asked to keep hoisted danger signal 6 and 5, respectively, the Bangladesh Meteorological Department said in a special bulletin. The last major cyclone to hit Bangladesh was 'Sidr' in November 2007, leaving a death toll of around 3,000 in its wake. A devastating cyclone in April 1991 claimed the lives of nearly 140,000 people. bdnews2
