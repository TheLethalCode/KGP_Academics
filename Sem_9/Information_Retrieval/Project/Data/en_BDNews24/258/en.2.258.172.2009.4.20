 New Delhi, Apr 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The following is a snapshot of recent developments in India's general election campaign. (The sources are mentioned in brackets). The head of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), an ally of Congress in Tamil Nadu, said the leader of the Tamil Tiger rebels in Sri Lanka was "not a terrorist" but a friend. M. Karunanidhi said in a television interview the Tigers' aims for an independent Tamil homeland were genuine but had been marred by terrorist elements. The remarks may appeal to some of the state's 60 million Tamils but could embarrass Congress, which distanced itself from Karunanidhi's stance. India is seeking the extradition of Tamil Tiger leader Vellupillai Prabhakaran, blamed for former Congress Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's assassination during a 1991 election campaign in Tamil Nadu. (The Asian Age, The Indian Express). India's Election Commission rejected a plea to disqualify Congress party chief Sonia Gandhi from parliament after she accepted a Belgian national award in 2006. A lawyer from Kerala state had made the plea, arguing Gandhi's acceptance of the "Order of Leopold" meant she owed allegiance to Belgium's constitution. (The Hindu)
