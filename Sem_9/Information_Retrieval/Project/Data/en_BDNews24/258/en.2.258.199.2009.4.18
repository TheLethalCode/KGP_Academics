Playmaker Arman Aziz's 19th minute free-kick separated both side's at the Police ground in Kathmandu. According to a BFF message, assistant coach Shafiqul Islam Manik informed that Bangladesh began with a 4-2-3-1 formation but could not perform as expected due to the small-sized playground and uneven pitch.

However, Dido tested as many as seven players sending them as substitutes after the playing eleven included goalkeeper Aminul, Nasir, Sujan, Saikat, Wali Faisal, Manik, Arman Aziz, Iman Babu, Mamunul Islam, Jahed Parev and Enamul Haq The result was all the more impressive as Nepal Police had earlier beaten B.
