 Cox's Bazar, Apr 21 (bdnews24.com)  Mixed reports came from Cox's Bazar on Wednesday over Myanmar's disputed border fencing activities, including construction of an earthen weir within 80 yards of zero point. BDR officials claimed Wednesday the neighbouring nation's border force Nasaka had ceased activities. Lieutenant colonel Sakhawat Hossain, captain of Cox's Bazar-based 17 Rifles Battalion, told bdnews24.com: "I visited that area of the border around noon today. Myanmar ceased construction of the weir after midday." "Nasaka has managed to pile up earth along a 100 yard stretch, but it is no threat to us in any case," he said. However, Majharul Anwar Chowdhury Sifat, Union Parisad chairman of Palongkhali, on the Myanmar border, said Nasaka was continuing "full swing" with construction of the weir with only a short break in the afternoon. "They have already completed 300 yards of the weir since Monday," he added. Myanmar began construction of the earthen embankment Monday within 80 yards of Border Pillar 20, opposite Palongkhali under Ukhia Upazila in Cox's Bazar. Myanmar army personnel and local Rakhain youths were assisting Nasaka, said locals of the sparsely populated border area. Lt Col Sakhawat said on Tuesday the Myanmar border force had invited BDR to company commander-level talks that might be held within a few days. "A timetable has not been fixed yet," he said. bdn
