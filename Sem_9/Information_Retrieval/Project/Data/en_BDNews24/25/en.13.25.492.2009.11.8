 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)  Ministers have called for patience regarding the launch of war crimes trials as the government is presses ahead with work. State minister for housing and public works, Abdul Mannan Khan, and state minister for law, Kamrul Islam, visited the building at 14 Abdul Gani Road on Sunday, where a special war crimes tribunal will be set up. Mannan, asked by reporters why trials had not yet begun almost one year into the present government's tenure, said: "The nation will have to have more patience. We have to be given time. We are not idling  we are progressing with our work." Currently, three administrative appeals tribunals and an office are housed in the building at 14 Abdul Gani Road. Mannan told the reporters that orders have been given to move these offices to Janata Tower in Kawran Bazar. "However, it will take about two months to relocate and make those offices fully operational again." Kamrul Islam said the government is gradually advancing towards the trials. "We have made much progress already. A budget has been allocated and passed in parliament. We are collecting information and evidence on war criminals." "When we are ready, we will reveal who are to be tried, who will prosecute and who will be the judges," said Islam. One of the Awami League's top election pledges was the long-awaited trial of 1971 war crimes. Several government ministers have given a series of dates in recent months for formation of investigative bodies, prosecution cells and tribunal. But these are yet to be announced. b
