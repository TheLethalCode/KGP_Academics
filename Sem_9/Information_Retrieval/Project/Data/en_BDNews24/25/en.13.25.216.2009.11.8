 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)The British Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce is looking to bring millions to Bangladesh, if the government can provide a suitable investment climate. A 15-member BBCC delegation, on a four-day trip to the country, sees "huge potential" for business and investment in Bangladesh. "Most of our delegates are British citizens of Bangladeshi origin," chamber president Shahagir Bakht Faruk told a press conference in the city on Sunday, jointly organised by BBCC and the British High Commission's UK Trade and Investment department. "Therefore, they all have a special feeling about the home country. We are trying to find ways to build more trade and commerce between Britain and Bangladesh." The delegation arrived in Dhaka Saturday on a mission to explore sectors suitable for investment in Bangladesh and products that would interest the British market. UKTI (Bangladesh) director Kevin Ringham said, "We are hoping that Bangladesh will get investments of more than $100 million through this initiative." But, he said, the amount of money was not the main focus right now. "Rather this initiative will start a new relationship, that will boost future cooperation in the field of business and investment. The businessmen said they were looking at shipping, hospitality, fashion, medical facilities, consultancy, education and housing. "We want Bangladeshi citizens to enjoy British services, technology, medical facilities, education and many other things. At the same time, we want to create scope for exporting new products," said Faruk. The BBCC are already invested in a number of projects in Bangladesh. bdn
