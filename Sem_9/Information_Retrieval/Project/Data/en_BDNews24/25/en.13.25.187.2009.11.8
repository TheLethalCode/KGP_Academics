 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh has strongly protested and expressed deep concern at the unprovoked shooting and killing of a Bangladeshi child by India's Border Security Force. A protest note, handed to the Indian High Commission in Dhaka, states that such shooting incidents are in clear violation of the Bangladesh-India Border Guidelines of 1975, the foreign ministry said on Sunday. A twelve year old Bangladeshi girl was shot and killed by Indian border guards of 162 BSF Sahapara Camp at around 6pm on Nov 6, the ministry said in a statement. The body of the child was found about 25 yards inside Bangladesh territory near Border Pillar No 1066 at Roumari in Kurigram district. Bangladesh has also conveyed concern at the trend of indiscriminate shooting and killing by BSF, which creates unnecessary tensions between the two border security forces, said the foreign ministry. "Such acts go against the spirit of good neighbourliness and the close friendly relations that exist between Bangladesh and India," the protest note observed. Bangladesh has demanded that a proper investigation be conducted by the concerned authorities of India and necessary legal action be taken against those responsible. Bangladesh has also called for a strong policy directive to the Border Security Forces to put an end to such shootings
