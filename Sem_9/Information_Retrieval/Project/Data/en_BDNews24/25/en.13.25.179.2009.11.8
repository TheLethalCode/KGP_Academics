 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)  Six people have so far died from infection of H1N1 virus (swine flu) in Bangladesh, the IEDCR said on Sunday. The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research confirmed three deaths until the first week of October. Three others died in the past one month. "Of the six dead, most of them live outside Dhaka. A laboratory test has confirmed that they were infected with H1N1 virus," Mahmudur Rahman, director of the IEDCR said. The number of H1N1 virus infected cases stood at 800 until Sunday, he said. The figure was 680 on Oct 11. Rahman said: "We do not fear the spread of swine flu in our country though it has turned serious in the developed countries. "The intensity of winter is not that helpful in transmission of the virus. That's why the chance of infection is very little here. "It comes to our country from the developed nations," he said. On H1N1 vaccine Rahman said: "Many countries have already started using the vaccine. "We are delaying procurement of the vaccine of our own as we expect to receive it from World Health Organisaiton. But we don't know about how much vaccine we will be provided and when." The IEDCR director, however, hoped to get the vaccine at the start of the next year. The first case of swine flu was detected in Bangladesh on June 18. The government on Aug 31 confirmed the first H1N1 death in Bangladesh. WHO declared a global H1N1 flu pandemic on June 11. b
