 Meherpur, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)  Police have arrested another nephew of Bazlul Huda, a death convict in the Bangabandhu murder case, in connection with the Oct 21 bomb attack on MP Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh. Investigation officer and assistant commissioner of the Detective Branch Md Akbar Hossain told bdnews24.com Habibur Azim Habib, 36, was detained from his house in Meherpur early on Sunday. He was to be taken to Dhaka, said police. Officer in charge of Meherpur Sadar Police Station Rabiul Islam said he was detained "at the order of higher authorities". Habib is the son of Anwarul Huda, Bazlul Huda's cousin. While detained at the police station, Habib claimed there was no case against him and he did not know why police had detained him. His wife Halima Khatun told journalists Habib returned from Malaysia two years ago after working there for many years. She said he now ran a fish farming business in Ujalpur village of Meherpur Sadar upazila. Detective Branch police last week arrested Ataul Huda, another nephew of Bazlul Huda, in connection to the same case. At least six relatives of four death convicts in the Sheikh Mujibur Rahman murder case, are among those arrested to date following the bomb attack case filed by Taposh. Police arrested Shariful Haque Dalim's brother Quamrul Haque Swapan on Oct 19. They arrested Khandaker Mehnaz Rashid, daughter of fugitive death convict Lt Col Abdur Rashid's on Oct 24. Mohammed Nazmul Hassan Sohel and Mahbubul Hassan, sons of former Lt Col Mohiuddin Ahmed, were arrested on Oct 27. Others arrested in the case are Shafiullah Safu and Abdur Rahim, both said to be members of the Freedom Party. Taposh, a nephew of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, is involved with the legal team assisting the state counsels in the ongoing appeals of the death convicts in the Bangabandhu murder case. Senior Awami League figures, including the prime minister, have suggested the bomb attack was an attempt to "derail the Bangabandhu murder trial proceedings". Taposh, a ruling party MP, whose parents Sheikh Fazlul Haque Moni and Arzoo Moni were murdered alongside Sheikh Mujib on Aug 15 1975, came under a bomb attack as he was leaving his Motijheel office by car on Oct 21. He was unhurt but 13 others, mostly bystanders, were injured by the blast. bdnews24.c
