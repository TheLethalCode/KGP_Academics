 GUWAHATI, India, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A five-wicket haul by left-arm seamer Doug Bollinger helped Australia restrict India to 170 in 48 overs in the sixth one-day international on Sunday. New ball bowler Bollinger dismissed Sachin Tendulkar (10) and Yuvraj Singh (6) off successive overs in his opening spell before claiming Mahendra Dhoni (24), Ravindra Jadeja (57) and Harbhajan Singh for a duck. All-rounders Jadeja and Praveen Kumar (54 not out) struck fifties and shared in a 74-run stand for the eighth wicket to lift the hosts, who were tottering at 27 for five. Spearhead Mitchell Johnson gave the world champions a spectacular start by dismissing opener Virender Sehwag (6) and in-form Gautam Gambhir (zero) in the first over of the match after India chose to bat first. Top-ranked Australia are eyeing an unassailable 4-2 in the seven-match series after winning the previous two encounters. Johnson, rested for the previous game, sent back Suresh Raina as the hosts lost half their side by the ninth over. Dhoni (24) put on 48 with Jadeja for the sixth wicket before he fell lbw to Bollinger, who removed Harbhajan two balls later. Jadeja rode his luck while Kumar batted with pluck to take the home side past the 150-m
