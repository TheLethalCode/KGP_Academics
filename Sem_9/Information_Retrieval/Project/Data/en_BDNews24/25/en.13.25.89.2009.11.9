 Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)River transport workers continued their countrywide indefinite strike on Monday as talks with the shipping ministry in realising their demands failed the previous day. bdnews24.com correspondent reported only one vessel reached Sadarghat terminal in Dhaka early morning that had set out from Bhola prior to the start of the strike enforced Saturday midnight. Bangladesh River Transport Workers Federation, a coalition of workers unions, enforced the strike to press home their 22-point demands, including a reasonable pay scale, effective application of riverine laws and curbing harassment and robbery on the river routes. Federation leaders were in talks with shipping secretary Abdul Mannan Hawlader through Sunday afternoon. Chowdhury Ashiqul Alam, general secretary of the federation, told reporters: "Talks with the government have failed. We'll continue our strike." The ministry's public relations officer, Jahangir Alam Khan, meanwhile, said the government had decided to form a committee, headed by a top labour ministry official, to prepare recommendations after reviewing the workers' demands, including pay issues. The strike paralysed river communication causing trouble to thousands of passengers and disrupting transportation of goods.
