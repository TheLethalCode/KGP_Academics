 Dhaka, Nov 08 (bdnews24.com)  Khandaker Mehnaz Rashid was denied bail and sent to jail Sunday, after three consecutive periods in remand as a suspect in the Taposh bomb attack case. Mehnaz, daughter of 'Bangabandhu' murder convict Khandakar Abdur Rashid, was arrested by the Detective Branch police on Oct 24 in connection with the bomb attack on Awami League lawmaker Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh's car on Oct 21. Dhaka additional chief magistrate Habibur Rahman Siddiqui dismissed her bail petition on Sunday. Habibur Azim Habib, a nephew of another 'Bangabandhu' murder convict Bazlul Huda, was arrested at his house in Meherpur earlier the same day. At least six relatives of four death convicts in the Sheikh Mujibur Rahman murder case, are among those arrested to date following the bomb attack on Taposh. Detective Branch police last week arrested Ataul Huda, another nephew of Huda, as a suspect in the same case. They arrested Shariful Haque Dalim's brother Quamrul Haque Swapan on Oct 19. Mohammed Nazmul Hassan Sohel and Mahbubul Hassan, sons of former Lt Col Mohiuddin Ahmed, were arrested on Oct 27. Others arrested in the case are Shafiullah Safu and Abdur Rahim, both said to be members of the Freedom Party. Taposh, a nephew of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, is involved with the legal team assisting the state counsels in the ongoing appeals of the death convicts in the Bangabandhu murder case. Senior Awami League figures, including the prime minister, have suggested the bomb attack was an attempt to "derail the Bangabandhu murder trial proceedings". Taposh, a ruling party MP, whose parents Sheikh Fazlul Haque Moni and Arzoo Moni were murdered alongside Sheikh Mujib on Aug 15 1975, came under a bomb attack as he was leaving his Motijheel office by car on Oct 21. He was unhurt but 13 others, mostly bystanders, were injured by the blast. bdnews
