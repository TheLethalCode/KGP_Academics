 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)River transport workers vowed to continue their indefinite strike on passenger, goods and fishing vessels as talks with the shipping ministry failed on Sunday. The strike, which began Saturday midnight, had paralysed river communications from morning. The Bangladesh River Transport Workers Federation, a coalition of worker unions, enforced the strike to press their 22-point demands, including a proper pay scale, effective application of riverine laws and a stop to harassment and robbery on river routes. Federation leaders were in talks with shipping secretary Abdul Mannan Hawlader through the afternoon. Mid-meeting, general secretary of the federation Chowdhury Ashiqul Alam emerged at arounf 7.30pm to tell reporters, "Talks with the government have failed. We'll continue our strike." He said discussion of their demands was still going on however. "The owners will be called in for a tri-lateral meeting if any positive decision is made today. But it will take much time, and the strike will go till then," Alam added. The ministry's public relations officer Jahangir Alam Khan, meanwhile, said the government has decided to form a committee, headed by a top labour ministry official, to prepare recommendations after reviewing the workers' demands, including pay issues. Hundreds of passengers were stranded at Sadarghat since Sunday morning, finding no launches leaving the capital's main river terminal, while goods piled up too. Launches bound for nearby destinations like Chandpur generally leave in the morning while those on the distant routes set out in the afternoon. Huge crowds scrambled to get a place on one of the few vessels leaving the terminal, the government-run 'Rocket' steamer that left for Khulna at 6pm. Thousands of other passengers were seen waiting through the day, expecting withdrawal of the strike. Motor launch MV Reaz's employee Asgar Hossain said they would not call off the strike until their demands were met. In Chittagong, port officials said unloading of ships at the outer-anchorage had been halted as lighter ships were not operating during the strike. Joint secretary of the Bangladesh River Transport Workers Federation Khorshed Alam told bdnews24.com, "No lighter ship has offloaded goods from the mother vessels since morning." Port authorities said some 48 ships have been waiting to unload. 'No untoward incidents' Dhaka Kotwali police chief Md Salahuddin told bdnews24.com no untoward incidents occurred through the day, though "a faction" of workers demonstrated in defiance of the strikers. Pro-ruling party Bangladesh River Transport Workers League marched Sunday afternoon in protest against the strike, he said. "But police patrol has been tightened. There is no possibility of deterioration of law and order here," he added. bdnews
