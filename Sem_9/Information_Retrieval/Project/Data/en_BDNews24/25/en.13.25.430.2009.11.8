<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)Terrorists are getting their hands on small and light firearms seized by law enforcers in South Asia although they should have been destroyed, the finance minister says. "Those arms need to be destroyed since the terrorists get those again," AMA Muhith said at a regional seminar on Sunday. "It'll bring comfort to all," Muhith told the two-day seminar on 'Peace and Security in South Asia: Issues and Preferences to Control Small and Light Firearms' at a hotel in Dhaka. However, in the beginning of his speech Muhith was confused about his invitation. "It's not clear why I have been asked to inaugurate (the seminar) or given the honour of 'chief guest' of the seminar on this topic." According to statistics in 2001, the latest available figure, Muhith said there are some 5 billion small arms in the world and 5,000 people are killed every day on average in gunfire, "which is alarming". "Arms worth $1,464 billion were traded in 1981 during the Cold War. The business saw a downturn following the knock-down of 'Berlin Wall' in 1989-90. But after the 9/11 terrorist attack on the Twin Towers, the business soared again." Land mines were the most preferred means in earlier days. But now the small and light arms have seen a rise in demand, the minister said. Government representatives and experts from the SAARC countries, China and the United Nations attended the seminar organised by the Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies (BIISS), a government-run research centre. bdn
