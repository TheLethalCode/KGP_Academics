 Pabna, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)--An Union Parishad chairman, allegedly an extremist leader, was killed in a so-called gunfight with police in Faridpur Upazila in Pabna early on Monday. Police identified the man as Kamruzzaman Oli, 45, chairman of Pabna's Hadal Union and a top leader of Purba Bangla Communist Party (ML-Janjuddha) of the region. But Abdus Sattar Khan, the father of the deceased, alleged that his son was killed after he had been brought to Pabna from Dhaka's Mirpur. Pabna police superintendent Nibash Chandra Majhi told bdnews24.com that they had raided the spot at around 12:30am on a tip-off that a group of terrorists was holding a clandestine meeting in Hadal village. The alleged terrorists opened fire, forcing the law enforcers to retaliate, he said. The extremists fled the scene at one stage of the shootout, leaving Oli dead on the spot. Police recovered one gun, seven rounds of ammunition and some ammunition, the SP said. He added that Oli had faced at least four cases. bdnews
