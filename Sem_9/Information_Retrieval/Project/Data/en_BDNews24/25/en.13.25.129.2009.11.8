 WELLINGTON, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand Cricket (NZC) officials hope to appoint a new national coach by the end of the the year. Former coach Andy Moles quit last month after falling out with senior players and the team are playing their current limited over series against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates without a coach. NZC chief executive Justin Vaughan said he expected a new coach would be named by the end of next month to allow him to prepare the team for their home series against Bangladesh, starting in February. "There's no rush. It's important that we make the right appointment," Vaughan said in a statement on Sunday. "We have begun a scoping exercise to clearly define the exact requirements for the position. "This is an essential first step which needs to be completed before any meaningful conversations can be held with potential candidates." Vaughan said he had been approached by a number of people interested in the position but was still uncertain the process he would use to pick the new coach. "The position will not be openly advertised, and we shall actively identify potential candidates we want to talk to," he said. "I can confirm I have received a number of strong inquiries from both New Zealand and overseas." Former coach Steve Rixon had already indicated he may be interested in the job, while local media have reported that former New Zealand opening batsman and India coach John Wright was also interested.
