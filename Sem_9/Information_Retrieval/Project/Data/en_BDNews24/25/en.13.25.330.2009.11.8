 Dhaka, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka and Thimphu renewed a bilateral trade deal and discussed climate change on Saturday, during Sheikh Hasina's visit to the Himalayan kingdom. Bhutanese prime minister Jigmi Y Thinley thanked his Bangladesh counterpart for highlighting the impact of climate change on countries like Bhutan, alongside Bangladesh, in the global arena. "We are grateful to you for your noble efforts in raising the issue prominently in important international forums," Thinley told Hasina at a meeting on the second day of her visit. Briefing the press, following the meeting, the prime minister's deputy press secretary Nazrul Islam said the two premiers discussed a range of socio-economic issues and strengthening of ties in important areas including trade and connectivity. Officials, touring with the prime minister, told bdnews24.com that the two premiers also agreed on increasing road connectivity between the two South Asian countries for further expansion of bilateral trade. Foreign minister Dipu Moni had said ahead of the visit that Bangladesh and Bhutan would broach the subject of transit through India, but were not expected to sign a deal just yet. She said the two countries would renew a trade agreement, however. The agreement was renewed between the two sides on Saturday. Bangladesh's commerce minister Faruque Khan and his Bhutanese counterpart Lyonpo Khandu Wangchuk signed the agreement on behalf of their respective countries. Bhutanese foreign minister Lyonpo Ugyen Tshering and minister for economic affairs of Bhutan Lyonpo Khandu Wangchuk were with the Bhutanese side while Bangladesh foreign minister Dipu Moni, industries minister Dilip Barua and prime minister's adviser HT Imam accompanied Hasina during the meeting. Hasina said renewal of the agreement would further expedite bilateral trade and commerce between the two countries benefiting both. Hasina eyes power from Bhutan Hasina also expressed interest in importing electricity from the Himalayan nation during her visit. Bhutanese press focused on the power issue on Hasina's arrival in capital Thimphu Friday. Bhutan's English-language daily Kuensel asked: "Will Bhutan be able to export electricity to Bangladesh in the future?" "If Bhutan can export electricity we will be very happy to get it," Kuensel quoted Hasina as telling the Bhutanese press. Foreign minister Dipu Moni had told bdnews24.com, before their departure, that Bangladesh wanted to "become involved" with production of electricity in Bhutan, an energy surplus country. The tiny mountainous kingdom has the potential to produce up to 30,000 MW of hydro electric power, according to estimates of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. Indian companies have so far been able to extract 10,000 MW from the country, most of which goes to India, experts say. If Bangladesh and Bhutan reach an agreement on power, however, they must get Indian approval to implement it. The two countries would have to construct distribution lines across 50 kilometres of Indian territory for export of electricity from Bhutan. Audience with the king Hasina was given a royal welcome for her audience with King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck at his Tashichodzong office on Saturday morning. Hasina's motorcade was led by a colourful Chipdrel procession, with flutes, trumpets, drums and Bhutanese dancers in traditional dress, to the South Gate of the Tashichhodzong. Here, Sheikh Hasina and the Bangladesh delegation were received by Thimphu governor Lhab Dorji and senior government officials. The national anthems of Bangladesh and Bhutan were sung, as Hasina received a guard of honour and salute from the Bhutanese Royal Army. Hasina, in her later meeting with her Bhutanese counterpart, thanked his government and the people for her warm reception in the city of Thimphu. He accepted the invitation, saying he would visit Bangladesh at a convenient time. She handed over medicines to her Bhutanese counterpart as part of Bangladesh's offer of emergency drugs worth Tk 20 lakh for victims of the country's recent earthquake. bdn
