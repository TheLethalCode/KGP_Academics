Russian Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov said last month "there have been no such deliveries to date." The truck-mounted S-300PMU1, known in the West as the SA-20, can shoot down cruise missiles and aircraft. It can fire at targets up to 150 km (90 miles) away and travel at more than two km per second.

Iran has threatened to retaliate for any attack by firing medium-range missiles at Isr
