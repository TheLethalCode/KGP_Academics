 Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court on Monday upheld controversial businessman Giasuddin Al Mamun's bail granted by the High Court in a tax evasion case. A five-member Appellate Division bench, headed by justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim, made the order rejecting the government's appeal to overturn the bail order. He will not be released from detention in prison since he faced another case involving money laundering, Sabbir Hamza, lawyer for Mamun told reporters. Mamun got a six-month bail from the High Court in this case on Oct 20. The National Board of Revenue filed the case with Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court on Aug 26 against Mamun for dodging Tk 14 crore in income tax. Additional attorney general A K M Jahirul Haque represented the state while barrister Rafique-ul Huq stood for Mamun. The Appellate Division on Nov 2 upheld Mamun's bail in four extortion cases. On Jan 30, 2007, the joint forces had arrested Mamun, who is known as a close friend and business partner of Tarique Rahman, the son of former prime minister Khaleda Zia.
