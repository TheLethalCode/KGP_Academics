<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com) -- The "untold" story of Pakistan cricket icon Imran Khan has finally been revealed by an Indian journalist, who has come up with unknown details about the sportsman-turned-politician, reports PTI. Khan's cricketing glory fascinated Frank Huzur, a young boy from Bihar capital Patna, to such an extent that by the time he completed his studies and started his career as a journalist, the fascination turned into a passion for the former Pakistan skipper. "Imran was not only a superstar of the cricketing world but also a celebrity. He was very positive and very affirmative. I could never come across a cricketer who had an independent opinion on the state of world affairs," Huzur, who has finished Khan's authorised biography "Imran versus Imran -- An Untold Story", said. The book is Huzur's tribute not only to Imran's politics of "struggle and sacrifice" but also to Pakistani society and people, he said. The Indian journalist travelled to Pakistan several times and visited Lahore, Islamabad and Mianwali in search of credible information about Imran. The former cricketer is as much popular across the world as Congress party scions Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi, Huzur said. Rahul has said he likes Imran's political style, which has been quite surprising to many people in India, as has been Imran's endorsement of Rahul's efforts at grassroots politics, he said. Speaking about the relationship between India and Pakistan, Huzur said that the major problems affecting the two neighbours are illiteracy and ignorance, and more needs to be done by the two governments. "There have been efforts to defuse tension between the two at individual and non-government levels. Cultural and literary exchanges do have a role in enhancing people-to-people contacts but both governments should increase the frequency of meetings and visits of bureaucrats, both civil and military," he suggested. The 550-page book to be published in London, is likely to come out during next spring. Imran Khan played for Pakistan from 1971 to 1992 and served as its captain throughout 1982-1992. He led his team to World Cup victory in 1992. In 1996, Khan founded the Tehreek-e-Insaf party, and represented Mianwali as a member of the National Assembly from November 2002 to October
