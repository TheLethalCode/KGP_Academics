 Prokash Biswas bdnews24.com court correspondent Dhaka, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com)Long-awaited security cameras that finally began surveillance at Dhaka courts at the end of last month are already delivering benefits, an official said on Saturday. The decision to set up closed circuit television cameras as a security measure in the trial courts was first made following the Aug 17 2005 countrywide serial bombings by militants. But they took more than four years to set up. Eight CCTV cameras were finally installed on Oct 27 this year to monitor the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court and Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court. All entry points of the two prison cells at the two court premises can now be monitored from a control room on the ground floor of the CMM court premises, which is used as the headquarters of the criminal prosecution division of metropolitan police. Ruhul Amin, deputy commissioner of police at the prosecution division, and in charge of the control room, told bdnews24.com, "We are already seeing the benefits of the cameras." "The number of touts and troublemakers loitering on the court premises has dropped significantly and illegal transaction of money has waned simultaneously." On an average, 700 prisoners produced before the court each day, from Dhaka Central Jail and Kashimpur Jail, can be monitored through the cameras, said Amin. The cameras operate on all holidays including weekends Friday and Saturday. Each camera covers a range of 30 feet and is equipped with night vision. Recorded images remained on tape for 10 days, he added. Amin said 22 more closed circuit cameras would be installed on court premises "very soon." Shakhawat Hossain, proprietor of Nirapatta Services Ltd, supplier of the cameras, said, "US-based company Avtek manufactured the camera parts that were later assembled in Taiwan." b
