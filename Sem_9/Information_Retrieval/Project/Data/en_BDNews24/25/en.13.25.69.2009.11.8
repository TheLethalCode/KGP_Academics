<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 08 (bdnews24.com)  The Appellate Division on Sunday stayed a High Court order on city developer Rajuk to reserve 130 plots of Uttara Model Town's Phase III project before holding lottery for allocating of land there. Appellate Division chamber judge Mohammed Mozzammel Hossain gave a seven-day stay on a petition by the government. The High Court on Nov 4 ordered Rajuk to distribute plots in the third phase of the Uttara project only after setting aside 130 plots, whose allocation had been cancelled during the past caretaker government. Around 300 Uttara third phase plots were distributed on Oct 6, 2006. Of these, 130 allocations were cancelled by the caretaker government on allegations of irregularities. Applicants were invited again for the plots on Nov 26 last year. The High Court order was made on a petition filed at the beginning of this year by the 130 individuals who lost the plots. Meanwhile, Rajuk on the same day, Nov 4, had already allotted 273 plots by lottery in Uttara's Phase III project and in the new satellite town of Purbachal. The Uttara lottery saw 218 plots go to freedom fighters, artists, writers, sportspersons, private service holders, lawyers and forex earners, among others. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam was assisted in Sunday's hearing by deputies Mohammed Sohrawardy and Motahar Hossain Shaju. Deputy attorney general Mohammed Sohrawardy told reporters of the stay order at the end of the hearing. bdne
