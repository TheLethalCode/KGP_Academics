 Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)--Action will be taken against military officers if any links are found with the bomb attack on MP Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh , the home minister said on Monday following media reports. "The matter is under investigation. Whoever is linked with the event will have to get punishment," Sahara Khatun said in reply to a media query after a meeting with visiting UNCTAD executive director Mike Smith. A number of media reported that several military officers were involved with the bomb attack on Taposh, one of the lawyers of the state panel in the Bangabandhu murder appeals hearing. Sahara said there were allegations against military officers for their links with the killings of political leaders since the assassination of founding father 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Aug 15, 1975. "The tendency has started since 1975. They (the military officers) will not dare to proceed further once the Bangabandhu murder trial is complete." The minister said the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development executive director, also assistant secretary general of the United Nations, had proposed for setting up a Counter Terrorism Institute in Bangladesh. The government is determined to wipe out militancy. If the institute is built not only Bangladesh but also the member countries of SAARC will benefit from it in controlling and curbing militancy, she said. bd
