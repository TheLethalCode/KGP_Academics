 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)  The government will introduce its national service job scheme from next month to provide employment to one educated member per family, the finance minister said on Sunday. "This government in its election manifesto pledged to provide jobs for at least one educated member per family. The national service programme is being introduced to meet that pledge," AMA Muhith told reporters after opening a seminar at Sheraton Hotel. "It will be introduced from December in the initial phase in Barguna and Kurigram districts and later spread to other districts," he said. Applications will be invited from those who have passed HSC or equivalents, and a list will be prepared of the deserving candidates, Muhith said. Those selected will be given three months' training after which they will be appointed to different government departments for two years, particularly as assistants to agriculture and education officers, he said.
