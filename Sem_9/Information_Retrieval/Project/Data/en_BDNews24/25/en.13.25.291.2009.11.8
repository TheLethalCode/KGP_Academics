<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)Kushtia police recovered eight "large bombs" in the Islamic University locality near the district town on Saturday. Two members of a faction of the outlawed militant outfit Gono Bahini were arrested with the bombs, Kushtia police assistant superintendent (headquarters) Alamgir Hossain told bdnews24.com. The two were identified as Moyen Uddin, 38, and Imdadul Haque, 43. "The bombs were found in a plastic bag in Moyen's possession," said Hossain. "We were tipped off that members of the banned extremist outfit were meeting secretly at a banana plantation in the Santidanga 14 Mile area," said the police official. Detective Branch police went to the spot at around 11.45pm to round up the suspects, said Hossain. "Seven or eight of them managed to escape before police could arrest Moyen and Imdadul." Hossain said the bombs recovered were "much larger in size than handmade 'cocktail bombs'." "They have been soaked in water to deactivate them," he said. Bomb experts were inspecting them, he added. Police are interrogating Moyen and Imdadul for further information. "We suspect they were planning some major attack," said Hossain. Law enforcers have expressed concern in recent months at the rising incidence of extremist activities in the southwest, attempting a serious crack down in the region, Kushtia in particular. Less than a week ago, Kushtia police arrested local Mahila Awami League leader Taslima Khanam Akhi with an AK-47 assault rifle. The AL leader and three associates were arrested from a vehicle on the outskirts of the district town on Nov 3, in possession of the AK-47, a shotgun and 82 rounds of ammunition. Police said all four were found to have links to Gono Mukti Fouz, another left-leaning militant outfit banned by the government. Akhi was expelled from the ruling party's women's wing the following day for "violating party discipline and for links to criminal activities". Meanwhile, the law and order crack down in the southwest has led to a spate of so-called 'crossfire' killings in recent months. Some 27 suspected militants have been killed over the past three months in Kushtia alone in reported shootouts with law enforcers.
