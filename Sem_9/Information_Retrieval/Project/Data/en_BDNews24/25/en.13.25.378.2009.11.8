<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 07 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh River Transport Workers Federation began an indefinite strike from Saturday midnight to press demands including better wages, a federation leader said. Shah Alam, senior vice president of the federation, told bdnews24.com that the strike had begun "as scheduled" at midnight after overnight launches had left terminals. He said passengers, goods and fishing vessels would all be observing the strike. "It will continue until our demands are met," he said. However, transport owners said they would not bow to the strikers. One top official of the River Transport Owners Association said, "We will operate as normal in the morning." Faruk Hossain, manager of river launch MV Tipu, told bdnews24.com, "Our launch will run despite the strike." Mahbubur Rahman, police sub-inspector at the capital's main Sadarghat Terminal, told bdnews24.com extra police and RAB teams have been deployed in case of trouble. There had been no untoward incident as the strike began, he added. Workers federation leader, Alam, said they were forced to call the strike as they did not receive any hint of a solution to problems even after setting a 15-day deadline on Oct 21. He said they had in fact been pressing their demands since August, which include a proper pay scale, effective application of riverine laws and a stop to harassment and robbery on river routes. Alam said they spoke with shipping minister Shahjahan Khan, river vessel owners and others about their demands, who all assured them of "solutions". But, said the federation leader, with no sign of progress, the river workers were forced to set a 15-day deadline on Oct 21. BIWTA director Shafiqul Haque told bdnews24.com: "Talks have taken place more than once, but no development has yet come out." He said he did not see any possibility that the workers would call off the strike. b
