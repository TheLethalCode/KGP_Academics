<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)--The High Court has asked the government why the MPs should not be removed as advisers to the Upazila Parishad, a local government body. The bench of justices Mohammad Anwarul Haque and A H M Shamsuddin Chowdhury issued the order on Sunday on a petition filed by three Upazila chairmen of Manikganj. It asked the government why the provision of appointing the MPs as advisers to Upazila Parishad and their approval in the planning of development programme should not be declared illegal. It also asked the government why the provision of keeping the Upazila Nirbahi officers presidents of standing committees instead of secretaries should not be declared illegal. The government has had four weeks to give the reply to the rule. Manikganj's Gheor Upazila chairman Afzal Hossain Khan, Saturia Upazila's Abdul Majid and Sadar Upazila's Ataur Rahman Ata filed the plea on Sunday. Kamal Hossain and Shahdin Malik argued for the petitioners. Malik told reporters after the ruling: "The rule has been issued asking the government why the four sections of the amended Upazila Parishad Act should not be declared illegal. Parliament on April 6 passed the Upazila Parishad (Amendment) Act 2009 restoring powers of MPs over the councils and making the elected chairmen virtually toothless. The Upazila chairmen have been protesting against the Act since then. According to the new law, recommended by the parliamentary standing committee on local government, elected chairmen will mainly be in charge of planning and monitoring development programmes at the grassroots. bdne
