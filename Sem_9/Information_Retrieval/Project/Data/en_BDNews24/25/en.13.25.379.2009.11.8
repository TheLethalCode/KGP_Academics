 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)  South Africa's batting line-up enjoyed a useful workout in the opening ODI against Zimbabwe in Benoni on Sunday as they reached an impressive 295-5, reports Cricinfo. Hashim Amla top-scored with a fluent 80 while AB de Villiers also looked in fine touch for a run-a-ball 51. The late acceleration came from Albie Morkel's 39-ball half century and Alvrio Petersen, recalled to a new role in the middle order, as the batting Powerplay brought 58 runs. However, the home side didn't have it all their own way as the Zimbabwe spinners kept a lid on the scoring rate during the middle of the innings with Ray Price taking three wickets. Amla and captain Graeme Smith gave the innings a solid base, although Smith struggled for his timing to begin with as he settled in on a sluggish surface.

De Villiers, meanwhile, has been moved up the order to No 3, with Arthur wanting to give him more time to build an innings and improve on a slightly disappointing return of three centuries in 89 ODIs. He certainly had time today to register hundred No 4, moving effortlessly to a 48-ball half-century, before picking out long-off where Mark Vermeulen held a well-judged catch. Zimbabwe now managed to haul in the scoring rate with Amla content to work the field while Mark Boucher struggled to find his timing. Amla was set to bat through the innings when, much to his disgust, he deposited a long hop from Graeme Cremer down deep midwicket and three overs later, Boucher's laboured effort ended with a miscued drive to long-off. Morkel gave himself a few overs to settle then the Powerplay was taken. The first two over went for just five each, but then the boundaries started to flow with the next three costing 48. Morkel collected three sixes, including a tracer-bullet blow flat over long-on during his second ODI half-century to go alongside the 97 he made in the previous meeting between these two sides. Petersen, playing his first ODI since March 2008, supported well with a sprightly effort as South Africa's superior skills were made to c
