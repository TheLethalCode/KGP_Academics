 Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com) -- Australian media on Monday hailed their national cricket team for the ODI series win against "upstart rivals" India in their own backyard, saying the triumph has established that Ricky Ponting's men are the undisputed kings of limited overs game, reports PTI. Australia took an unassailable 4-2 lead in the seven-match series after their six-wicket victory in Guwahati on Sunday, and the media here lauded Ricky Ponting's men for the way they tamed India despite being ravaged by injury to some of their top players before and during the tour. The series win also dashed India's ambition of dethroning Australia from the top position in the International Cricket Council ODI rankings.

"Australia will fly out this week with both its number one ranking and 13-year unbeaten run in one-day series here intact, after taking an unassailable 4-2 lead over India," the newspaper said.
