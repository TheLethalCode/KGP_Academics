<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com) -- Spot orders from buyers at this year's BATEXPO, the country's largest apparel fair, fell 30 percent from last year, according to the industry's top trade body. Spot orders at last year's expo amounted to $55.45 million; this year they totalled just $41.64 million, BGMEA president Abdus Salam Murshedi told a press briefing Sunday. On the reason behind the fall in orders, he said buyers are seeking lower prices. "Buyers say prices are much lower in other countries," said Murshedi. He said production costs had risen at home due to gas and power crises, mismanagement at Chittagong port and high rates of interest as well as bank charges. Exports of readymade garments in the first quarter of the current fiscal dropped by 9.71 percent compared to the same period last year, he added. "Exports for the month of September fell by 26.93 percent from the same month last year." Meanwhile, the government has set export targets for woven and knitted garments at $17.6 billion this year, which is 13 percent above last year's target. Fearing further fall in exports in October, Murshedy told reporters the crisis can be averted if the government comes up with "policy support". The three-day BATEXPO 2009, of the Bangladesh Garments Manufacturer and Exporters Association, ended on Saturday. According to BGMEA, 62 organisations hosted 86 stalls for buyers from UK, US, Canada, Middle East, Hong Kong and Japan. bd
