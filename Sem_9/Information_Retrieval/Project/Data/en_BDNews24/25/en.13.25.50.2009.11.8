 GUWAHATI, India, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Left-arm seamer Doug Bollinger grabbed five for 35 to set up Australia's six-wicket victory over India in the sixth one-dayer Sunday for an unassailable 4-2 lead in the seven-match series. New ball bowler Bollinger dismissed Sachin Tendulkar (10) and Yuvraj Singh (6) off successive overs in his opening spell before claiming Mahendra Dhoni (24), Harbhajan Singh (zero) and Ravindra Jadeja for 57 to bowl out India for 170. All-rounders Jadeja and Praveen Kumar (54 not out) struck fifties and shared in a 74-run stand for the eighth wicket to lift the hosts, who were tottering at 27 for five after choosing to bat first on a two-paced pitch. In-form Shane Watson struck 49 but the world champions suffered a mini collapse when off-spinner Harbhajan Singh took Watson and Ricky Ponting (25) in quick succession. Michael Hussey (35 not out) put on 53 for the fourth wicket with Cameron White (25) and 29 with Adam Voges (23 not out) to guide the team to victory in 41.5 overs. Injury-hit Australia had five players sent back from the series with injuries. Spearhead Mitchell Johnson gave Australia a spectacular start by dismissing opener Virender Sehwag (6) and Gautam Gambhir (zero) in the first over of the match. The left-arm pacer, rested for the previous game, then sent back Suresh Raina for nought as the hosts lost half their side by the ninth over. Dhoni (24) put on 48 with Jadeja for the sixth wicket before he fell lbw to man of the match Bollinger, playing in his seventh game, who then removed Harbhajan two balls later. Jadeja rode his luck while Kumar batted with pluck to take the home side past the 150-mark. Australia, who won the Champions Trophy last month, won their third straight game in the series after having been 2-1 down. Opener Shaun Marsh fell early but Watson, who cracked 93 in the previous game, put on 61 with Ponting for the second wicket. Harbhajan foxed Watson and Ponting in successive overs on a turning pitch but vice-captain Hussey helped Australia win their second straight series victory in India following their 4-2 win two years ago. The last match will be played in Mumbai Wednesday.
