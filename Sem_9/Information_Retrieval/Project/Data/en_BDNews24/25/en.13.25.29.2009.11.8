<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)The High Court withheld on Sunday a verdict given the same day, which allows mutual funds to issue rights and bonus shares, for seven days. The move was made after pleas from lawyers defending the Securities and Exchange Commission that barred mutual funds issuing rights and bonus shares through an amendment. The verdict, however, had said that the ruling would be applicable only on the mutual funds that were listed when the amendment was done on July 22, 2008 by the SEC, said M Zahir, the counsel for the petitioners. "The High Court ruling also gave SEC the power to approve the issuance of right or bonus shares," he told reporters at the HC premises. SEC's lawyer Mahmudul Islam asked for the halt as they would appeal against the verdict, added Zahir. Mutual fund operators cited the verdict as "appropriate". "There's really nothing to be excited about the verdict," Md Iftikhar-uz-zaman, chief executive of ICB Capital Management told bdnews24.com. He however, said that mutual funds should have a provision to issue rights share or bonus shares. "The verdict is appropriate." Iftikhar said close-end mutual funds cannot issue stock dividends by definition. "Close-end mutual funds by definition can only increase its paid-up capital through revised redemption," he added. On July 22, 2007, the SEC amended the rule regarding mutual funds where it prohibited mutual funds to increase its paid up capital through issuing rights shares. The decision also barred mutual fund operators to issue bonus shares as dividend. An SEC spokesperson then told the press that the move was to remove the ambiguities in the rule. "There are some ambiguities in the rule about mutual funds," said SEC executive director Farhad Ahmed. The news of restrictions, just two days before the closing of accounts of mutual funds angered retail investors, followed by demonstrations by them and a slump in the prices of MFs. Consequently the market slipped into the red due to sell-offs as investor confidence on the market went down. bd
