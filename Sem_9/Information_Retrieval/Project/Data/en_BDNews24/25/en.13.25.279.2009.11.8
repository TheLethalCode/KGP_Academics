<TEXT>
 Chandpur, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)  River erosion has attacked Chandpur city embankment near Molehead, at the extreme west of the town. Thousands of blocks of a 700 sq km area of the embankment have reportedly fallen into the Meghna river. Local Water Development Board officials arrived on the scene Sunday. Chandpur district commissioner Biswas Md Azimuddin also municipality mayor Nasiruddin Ahmed also visited the site on Sunday. Primarily, sandbags were thrown around the endangered area, but without much effect against the currents of the Meghna, said locals. Panic has seized the families living in the area. Monwara Begum, Kulsum Begum and Bachchu Mian, among the residents in the endangered area, told bdnews24.com that the blocks of the embankment adjacent to the Jamuna Pilot House had begun to plunge into the river from 7am Sunday. Many of their neighbours had left their houses in fear, they said. Blocks worth Tk 22 crore were most recently relaid along the embankment at Molehead in 2007. Numerous establishments including Chandpur railway station, 'Machghat' (fishing wharf), the river terminal and an ice-factory, which had been situated just about 200 yards from the newly endangered area, were swallowed by the river during rapid erosion on September 19, 2001. People living there are still haunted by the memory of the destruction. BIWTA senior assistant director Zahiruk Alam Khan said Sunday night, "The situation has calmed down a bit." "Orders have been served to WDB officials to continuously monitor the situation there." "We have been throwing down sand-bags. If needed, blocks will be laid there on an emergency basis too." bdnews2
