<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 07 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina, on a visit to Bhutan, has expressed interest in importing electricity from the Himalayan nation. Hasina saw Bhutan's King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck Saturday at Tashichodzong in Thimpu. Hasina was also scheduled to meet Bhutanese prime minister Jigmi Y Thinley Saturday. "Will Bhutan be able to export electricity to Bangladesh in the future?" Bhutan's English-language daily Kuensel asked on its online site. "If Bhutan can export electricity we will be very happy to get it," Kuensel quoted Hasina as saying to the Bhutanese press. Foreign minister Dipu Moni, accompanying Hasina to Bhutan, told bdnews24.com Thursday, before their departure, that Bangladesh wanted to "become involved" with production of electricity in Bhutan, an energy surplus country. The tiny mountainous kingdom has the potential to produce up to 30,000 MW of hydro electric power, according to estimates of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). Indian companies have so far been able to extract 10,000 MW from the country, most of which goes to India, experts say. If Bangladesh and Bhutan reach an agreement on power, they must get Indian approval to make it successful. The two countries would have to construct distribution lines across 50 kilometres of Indian territory for export of electricity from Bhutan. Hasina also told the Bhutanese press after landing at Paro International Airport, "We want to enhance and develop the existing trade and business between two countries as Bhutan is a good neighbour of Bangladesh." Bangladesh's exports to Bhutan is less than $1 million, and includes warm garments, computer accessories, dry food, pharmaceuticals, toiletries and textile items. Bhutan's exports to Bangladesh totals around $14 million, according to the latter's commerce ministry figures. Bhutan's main export items are mineral products, foodstuffs, fruits, beverages and oat. Hasina, Dipu Moni, industries minister Dilip Barua, commerce minister Faruque Khan, and others of a 28-member delegation landed in the Bhutanese capital Friday on a three-day official visit.
