<TEXT>
 LONDON, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester City had to settle for a fifth consecutive Premier League draw on Saturday, finishing 3-3 with Burnley after having battled back from a two-goal deficit to lead with three minutes remaining. Tottenham Hotspur took advantage to move back into the top four above City with a 2-0 home defeat of Sunderland after two consecutive losses while Aston Villa climbed to fifth with a 5-1 hammering of Bolton Wanderers at Villa Park. Portsmouth remain bottom of the table after losing 3-1 at fellow strugglers Blackburn Rovers. City looked to have sealed the points when goals from Shaun Wright-Phillips, Kolo Toure and Craig Bellamy wiped out Burnley's 2-0 lead but Kevin McDonald struck late to earn the visitors their first away point this season. "It's fair to say we were disappointed with our first half performance," City manager Mark Hughes, who spent nearly 100 million pounds in pre-season, told Sky Sports. "We put in a huge effort to get our noses in front and we should have seen the game out. There are things we need to look and things we need to address." City, who last won a league game in September, fell to sixth on 20 points, Villa have 21 while Tottenham are on 22, the same as Arsenal who can leapfrog Manchester United into second spot if they win at Wolverhampton Wanderers later. Sunderland could count themselves unlucky to lose at Tottenham, dominating the game for long periods. Robbie Keane gave Tottenham and early lead but were hanging on to that slender advantage when their former striker Darren Bent was brought down by goalkeeper Huerelho Gomes to earn a penalty, only to have it saved by the Brazilian who was fortunate to still be on the pitch. Sunderland manager Steve Bruce bemoaned his side's luck. "Anybody who witnessed that today will know that we should have got something," he told Sky. "We were terrific. "In my opinion Gomes should have been sent off because he denied a clear goalscoring opportunity. That was the turning point. We missed the penalty and they should be down to 10." Tom Huddlestone wrapped up the points when he blasted a shot past Sunderland's substitute keeper Marton Fulop, one of five former Tottenham players in action for the visitors.
