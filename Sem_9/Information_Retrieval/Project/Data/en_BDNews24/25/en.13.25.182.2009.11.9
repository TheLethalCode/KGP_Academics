 Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)The attorney general capped his arguments on Monday at the hearing of death appeals at the Supreme Court in the Bangabandhu murder case. The five-member Appellate Division bench, headed by justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam, began hearing arguments for the 26th day at around 9:45am. It ended at around 1:45pm. Another state counsel Toufique Newaz will begin his arguments on Tuesday. After the prosecution is done with its arguments, the defence counsels will get their turn to reply to the arguments. The hearing focuses on the five points, based on which the Appellate Division had granted the appeal petition. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam argued against the defence plea of an 'army mutiny' at the previous day's hearing. "The Aug 15 killing in no way can be termed a mutiny. Even the convicts in their statements did not say it was a mutiny," he had said. Before Alam, the chief state counsel in the case, Anisul Haque, delivered his arguments. The prosecution started its arguments on Nov 2. On Oct 5, the newly formed bench began hearing the appeals against previous court sentences to hang some convicts in the case for assassinating the nation's founding leader 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Aug 15, 1975. bdne
