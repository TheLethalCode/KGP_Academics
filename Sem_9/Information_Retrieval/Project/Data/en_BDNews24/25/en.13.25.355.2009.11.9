 LONDON, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sunderland striker Darren Bent has been recalled to the England squad for next Saturday's friendly against Brazil in Qatar despite missing a penalty in front of England coach Fabio Capello on Saturday. Bent has been in excellent form since moving to Sunderland this season, scoring eight goals for his new side. However, he did miss a penalty when Sunderland lost 2-0 at his former club Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday. Tottenham's Tom Huddlestone, who scored a blistering goal against Sunderland on Saturday, could win his first senior England cap. Aston Villa defender Stephen Warnock is also included and has the chance to add to the one cap he won as an 84th minute substitute when England played Trinidad & Tobago in Port of Spain in June last year. Capello has again omitted Michael Owen, even though forwards Emile Heskey and Carlton Cole are out with injuries and Owen's chances of playing in the World Cup finals next year now look slim. Other absentees include Steven Gerrard, Rio Ferdinand, Ashley Cole, Aaron Lennon and David James. They are all carrying injuries, apart from Cole who is playing his way back into the Chelsea side after an injury layoff. Squad Goalkeepers: Ben Foster (Manchester United), Robert Green (West Ham United), Joe Hart (Birmingham City). Defenders: Wayne Bridge (Manchester City), Wes Brown (Manchester United), Gary Cahill (Bolton Wanderers), Glen Johnson (Liverpool), Joleon Lescott (Manchester City), John Terry (Chelsea), Matthew Upson (West Ham United), Stephen Warnock (Aston Villa). Midfielders: Gareth Barry (Manchester City), Michael Carrick (Manchester United), Tom Huddlestone, Jermaine Jenas (both Tottenham Hotspur), Frank Lampard (Chelsea), James Milner, Ashley Young (both Aston Villa), Shaun Wright-Phillips (Manchester City). Forwards: Darren Bent (Sunderland), Peter Crouch, Jermain Defoe (both Tottenham Hotspur), Wayne Rooney (Manchester Uni
