 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)  The Sri Lankan Test team, seeking its first win in India, arrived in Mumbai on Sunday to play a three-match series, commencing on Nov 16, reports PTI. The team will begin their campaign with a three-day game against Board President's XI starting on Nov 11 in Mumbai, from where they will move on to Ahmedabad for the first Test starting from Nov 16. Kanpur (Nov 24- 28) and Mumbai (Dec 2- 6) will host the second and third Tests respectively. Both the teams have played each other 29 times in Test matches with India having won 11 matches, while the visitors have won only five. The remaining 13 matches have ended in draws. Interestingly, none of Sri Lanka's five wins have come in India though the visiting team has played 14 matches in the country. India beat Sri Lanka 2-0 the last time these two teams met in the country in a three-match series in 2005-06. After the Test series, Sri Lanka will play two Twenty20 Internationals -- Nagpur (Dec 9) and Mohali (Dec 12) -- and five one-dayers at Rajkot (Dec 15), Visakhapatnam (Dec 18), Cuttack (Dec 21), Kolkata (Dec 24) and Delhi (Dec 27). All the ODIs, barring the first, will be day-night encounters.
