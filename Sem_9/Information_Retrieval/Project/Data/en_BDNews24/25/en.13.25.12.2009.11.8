<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)  River transport workers enforced an indefinite strike from Saturday midnight to realise their 22-point demands disrupting movement of vessels across the country. No vessel left the Sadarghat terminal in the morning, stranding hundreds of passengers. The demands include a proper pay scale, effective application of riverine laws and stopping harassment and robbery on river routes. Bangladesh River Transport Workers Federation began the strike from Saturday midnight, taking in passenger, goods and fishing vessels. bdnews24.com correspondent Kamal Hossain reported there was no launch leaving Dhaka's main Sadarghat terminal as passengers intending to travel turned up. The launches bound for nearby destinations like Chandpur generally leave the terminal in the morning while those on the distant routes set out in the afternoon. Amena Begum, a passenger, told bdnews24.com she had come to the terminal to travel to Chandpur. "But there is no launch going there," she said. Another passenger Shahina Akhter had to return home when she failed to get any transport. Mahbubur Rahman, police sub-inspector at the capital's main Sadarghat terminal, told bdnews24.com no vessels had left the terminal since Sunday morning. Motor launch MV Reaz's employee Asgar Hossain said they would continue their strike until their demands were met. Shah Alam, senior vice president of the workers federation, earlier told bdnews24.com that the strike had begun "as scheduled" at midnight after overnight launches had left the terminal. "It will continue until our demands are met," he said. Alam said they were forced to call the strike as they did not get any hint for a solution to their problems even after setting a 15-day deadline on Oct 21. Alam said they had talked to shipping minister Shahjahan Khan, river vessel owners and others concerned people for meeting their demands. "They all assured us of a solution, but a solution is yet to come," he added. Since there was no sign of progress, the river workers were forced to set a 15-day deadline on Oct 21, he said. BIWTA director Shafiqul Haque told bdnews24.com: "Talks have taken place more than once, but there is no development yet in resolving the problems." He said he did not see any possibility that the workers would call off their strike soon. bdnews24.
