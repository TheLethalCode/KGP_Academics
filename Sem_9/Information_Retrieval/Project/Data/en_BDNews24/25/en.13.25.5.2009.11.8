<TEXT>
 MADRID, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pedro netted twice and Thierry Henry scored his first of the season to set leaders Barcelona on the way to a 4-2 win over Real Mallorca in La Liga on Saturday and put them four points clear of second-placed Real Madrid. Pep Guardiola fielded an unfamiliar starting lineup at the Nou Camp after consecutive draws against Osasuna and Rubin Kazan, leaving Spain midfielders Xavi and Andres Iniesta on the bench along with Argentina forward Lionel Messi. The ploy seemed to be paying off when Zlatan Ibrahimovic showed off his sublime talent to release Pedro to slot home Barca's first in the 11th minute but they were rocked back nine minutes later when Jose Carlos Nunes headed in from a corner. Mallorca goalkeeper Dudu Aouate was unlucky to concede a second five minutes before halftime after he produced three superb saves during a desperate goalmouth scramble to deny Pedro, Henry and Sergio Busquets. But Pedro eventually smashed the ball into the net from close range. Pedro was again involved in Barca's third four minutes later, floating a freekick to the far post that Busquets nodded back across goal for Henry, who recently returned from a thigh strain, to head into the empty net. Messi replaced Pedro in the 51st minute and stroked home a late penalty after Ibrahimovic was chopped down in the area before Alhassane Keita scored a consolation in added time. Barca have 26 points from 10 matches, four ahead of Real Madrid, who are again without the injured Cristiano Ronaldo when they play at city rivals Atletico in Saturday's late match. NINE-MAN DEPOR Deportivo Coruna made light of having a player sent off in each half earlier on Saturday to win 2-0 at Getafe and climb above Valencia into fourth. Mista nodded the visitors in front in the 15th minute before Miguel Angel Lotina's side went down to 10 men 12 minutes later. Striker Riki was shown a second yellow card for what appeared from television replays to be an attempted handball after he was earlier booked for diving in the penalty area. The referee sent an angry Lotina off the bench shortly after for the coach's repeated protests but Depor managed to double their lead on the hour when Mista presented defender Filipe with a simple tap in. Midfielder Sergio was dismissed with 17 minutes of regular time left for a second yellow but Depor kept Getafe at bay and are level on 19 points with third-placed Sevilla and one ahead of Valencia in fifth. Sevilla host improving Villarreal on Sunday and Valencia entertain promoted Real Zaragoza. Also on Saturday, Malaga fought back from two goals down to draw 2-2 at promoted Tenerife and moved one place off the bottom, above Xerez, who play at Real Valladolid on Sunday, on goal differ
