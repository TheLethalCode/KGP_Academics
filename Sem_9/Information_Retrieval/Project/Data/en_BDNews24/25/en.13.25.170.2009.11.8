 SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao meets African leaders on Sunday, aiming to boost a relationship which politically goes back decades and is now economically booming -- to the discomfort of some in the West. All eyes will be on new offers of aid to Africa at the meeting in Egypt, after President Hu Jintao promised $5 billion in loans and credit at the last summit in Beijing in 2006. Blossoming trade and business ties have drawn Western criticism that Beijing is only interested in African resources, while Chinese commentators retort that envious Europeans still treat the continent like a colony. Wen himself underlined the strength of the relationship. "Despite the great distance between China and Africa, the friendship between our two peoples has remained strong," he told a business forum in the Egyptian resort of Sharm El-Sheikh before the main meeting.

"The West is envious of China and Africa drawing closer," popular Chinese tabloid the Global Times, published by Communist Party mouthpiece the People's Daily, wrote on Tuesday. "Europeans view Africa as their own backyard," the newspaper quoted Chinese Africa expert Xu Weizhong as saying. "Of course they feel uncomfortable about the arrival of the Chinese." Some Africans welcome how China's approach differs from that of Europe or the United States. "China's policy is based on mutual development. Few Western countries have a foreign policy like this -- most are about telling Africans what to do," said Kwaku Atuahene-Gima, executive director of the Africa programme at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai. China says it is up to Africans to decide whether the relationship is good for them, and is sure they will say it is.
