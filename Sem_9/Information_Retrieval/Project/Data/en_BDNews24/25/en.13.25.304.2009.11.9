 Rajshahi, Nov 09 (bdnews24.com)  Two students were killed and at least 30 injured Monday as a study tour bus from Rajshahi Polytechnique Institute crashed into a roadside ditch trying to evade hijackers in Naogaon. The dead identified as third year students Imtiaz Hossain Razu, 20, of Godagari upazila, and Zeenat Rehana Moly, 20, of Rajshahi city. The institute's principal Dr Jainal Abedin told bdnews24.com that two buses were carrying students to Barapukuria Coalmine in Dinajpur on a study tour. "At around 3.30 in the morning, at Solpi bridge in Dhamoirhat upazila, on the Dhamoirhat-Jaypurhat highway, the buses came across trees placed across the road by a group of hijackers." "The bus drivers tried to evade the hijackers. That's when one of the buses lost control, veered off the road and crashed into a roadside ditch," said Abedin. Two students were killed on the spot, he said. Dhamoirhat police sub-inspector Rezaul Islam Reza said the bus driver, reaching Solpi bridge, had tried to take a U-turn at high speed after seeing the suspected hijackers on the bridge. Five injured students were admitted to Rajshahi Medical College hospital in critical condition, and over 20 others were admitted to Dhamoirhat Upazila Health Complex, said rescue workers. Patnitala fire brigade and Dhamoirhat police carried out rescue operations. Police gave no further information on the suspected hijackers. bdnews24.co
