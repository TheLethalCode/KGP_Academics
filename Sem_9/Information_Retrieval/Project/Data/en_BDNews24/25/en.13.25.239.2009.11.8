<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)Talks between river transport workers and the shipping ministry failed on Sunday afternoon. The workers vowed to continue their indefinite strike on passenger, goods and fishing vessels, which began Saturday midnight paralysing river communications from morning. The Bangladesh River Transport Workers Federation, a coalition of worker unions, enforced the strike to press their 22-point demands, including a proper pay scale, effective application of riverine laws and a stop to harassment and robbery on river routes. Hundreds of passengers were stranded at Sadarghat since Sunday morning, finding no launches leaving the capital's main river terminal, while goods piled up too. Launches bound for nearby destinations like Chandpur generally leave in the morning while those on the distant routes set out in the afternoon. Huge crowds scrambled to get a place on one of the few vessels leaving the terminal, the government-run 'Rocket' steamer that left for Khulna at 6pm. Thousands of other passengers were seen waiting through the day, expecting withdrawal of the strike. Motor launch MV Reaz's employee Asgar Hossain said they would not call off the strike until their demands were met. In Chittagong, port officials said unloading of ships at the outer-anchorage had been halted as lighter ships were not operating during the strike. Joint secretary of the Bangladesh River Transport Workers Federation Khorshed Alam told bdnews24.com, "No lighter ship has offloaded goods from the mother vessels since morning." Port authorities said some 48 ships have been waiting to unload. bdnews
