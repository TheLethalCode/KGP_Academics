 Dhaka, Sept 9 (bdnews24.com) -- The government has published a circular outlining permission for limited political activities, law adviser Mainul Hosein said Sunday night, hours after chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed lifted a ban on indoor politics. The removal of the ban is meant to facilitate talks between the Election Commission and political parties ahead of elections, scheduled to take place by the end of 2008. The government kept some restrictions in force in line with the state of emergency. Political parties are not allowed to make "inflammatory comments" against the government or take to the streets. The political parties have to seek permission for a gathering of more than 50 people, a home ministry official said, referring to the circular. The government may reopen the offices of the political parties on request. In a televised address to the nation, Fakhruddin lifted the ban on indoor politics, clearing the way for talks between the main election office and political parties. The decision prompted praises from the Awami League and BNP. bd
