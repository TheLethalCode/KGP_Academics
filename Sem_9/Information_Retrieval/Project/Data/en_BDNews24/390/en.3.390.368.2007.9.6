<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court dealing with a case on charges of gold smuggling against former president HM Ershad Thursday deferred the verdict for a seventh time to Sept 18. Abul Bassar, the judge of the First Additional Metropolitan Sessions Court for Dhaka, was to deliver the verdict Thursday but he regretted the postponement due to his illness. The case involves an alleged attempt to smuggle gold worth more than Tk 2 crore in 1990. On July 16, 1990 immigration authorities seized the gold from two foreigners, a German and a British, at Zia International Airport. Later, Customs and VAT inspector Md Zakaria, being a plaintiff, filed a case with Airport Police Station. On Aug 31, 1991, Ershad's name was included in a supplementary chasrgesheet of the case. Ershad's counsel Sheikh Sirajul Islam appealed to the court Thursday for pushing the date beyond Sept 17 arguing that it would be convenient for his client since there were more cases against him. The judge later set Sept 18 for the final verdict. Ershad came to the court at 10:15am to hear the verdict. "I am fine but the judge is sick. What can I do?," the former military ruler told bdnews24.com. His lawyer said he hoped that his client would get justice. Anisul Islam Mahmud, acting president of the Jatiya Party, accompanied Ershad to the court. bdnews24.com/p
