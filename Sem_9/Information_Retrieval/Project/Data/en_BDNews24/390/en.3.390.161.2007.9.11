 TOKYO, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's support rates have fallen near lows hit after he suffered an election drubbing in late July, according to a newspaper poll on Tuesday. About 29 percent of respondents in a weekend poll published by the Yomiuri newspaper said they support Abe, below the 30 percent level analysts say is critical and only 1.8 percentage points higher than a month earlier.

More than 63 percent said pensions and social security were the top priority, after a row over millions of misplaced pension records came to a head earlier this year. Other problems mentioned in the poll included employment, the economy and political corruption, the paper said.
