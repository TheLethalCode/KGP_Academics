 Dhaka, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com) - Stocks posted gains Thursday as buying pressure continued for an eighth day. "Limited supply of issues is pulling the prices of issues up. If there had been adequate supply, the market would have been steady," said Moin Al Kashem, a market analyst. "Nothing to worry about. The market will see a natural process of corrections," he said. Profit-taking drove the market down in morning trade. Indices however regained pace after midday trade as buying pressure mounted. Insurance and non-banking financial institutions and mutual funds gained. IT stocks and most of the banks fell on profit-taking. Cement and pharmaceutical sectors closed mixed. The DGEN or general index ended at 2553.91, up 12.93 points or 0.50 percent. The DSI or all-share price index added 7.78 points or 0.36 percent to 2127.11. The DSE-20 blue-chip index climbed 15.02 points or 0.73 percent to 2056.43. Gainers dominated losers 113 to 73. Some 18 issues held steady. Turnover dropped to Tk 1.67 billion from Wednesday's Tk 2.09 billion. A total of 79,94,159 shares traded on the DSE. On the Chittagong Stock Exchange, all indices except CSE-30 index finished higher with gainers beating losers 58 to 50. Seven issues closed unchanged. Turnover reached Tk 233.32 million from transactions of 13,38,716 shares. Power Grid Company of Bangladesh, market leader in turnover, declined 0.75 percent to Tk 659.25 due to profit-taking. Market major BRAC Bank, the second-highest traded scrip after Power Grid, surged 3.50 percent to an all-time high of Tk 1180. BRAC said it recorded Tk 216.95 million in net profit in the six months to June. "It's a matter of concern. Many issues have become overpriced. Investors, who trade by borrowing from brokers and merchant banks, should be careful. If correction starts, they will be the major losers," said Saiful Islam, an analyst at Equity Partners Securities. DESCO gained 0.48 percent to Tk 1146. UCBL advanced 2.96 percent to Tk 4408.75 on hopes of better dividend yields. It reported Tk 228.96 as earning per share in the January-June period this year.
