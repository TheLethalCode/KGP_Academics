<TITLE> Law in the making to cut punishment for the repentant </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com)  The government has planned to introduce a new law cutting punishment for those who would voluntarily confess to crimes, an adviser said Tuesday. The law will be named "Plea Bargain Act". Stressing the need for the law, law and information adviser Mainul Hosein told reporters in his office: "Many countries have such law. It's not clear to me why such law has not been made in Bangladesh yet." "When the law is made, any criminal can confess to crimes in court. It will reduce the penalty for the accused and time and money for running cases." On the gazette issued Monday for bail to the co-accused relatives of politicians in corruption cases, he said the government was thinking over giving bail to the co-accused for long. "The matter of not granting bail to the co-accused created a painful condition," he said. "Corrupt people in our country committed crime involving most of the members of their families. They deposited the money earned through corruption in the name of their close relatives that created a humanitarian situation," he said. "Considering the humanitarian side, the government has introduced the novel provision." Earlier, there was no provision of granting bail in the emergency powers rules to complete the trial of the corrupt persons in a short time. The amendment will remove the painful side. The court will be able to take decisions on bail." He said those who have already been sentenced in different cases they would also be able to appeal to the High Court for bail. "In this case the court can consider granting bail to the co-accused, as described in the law. They will face no more problems," Mainul said. bdnews24.com/mk
