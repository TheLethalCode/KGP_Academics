 MADRID, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A large car bomb placed by the Basque guerrilla group ETA in the northern city of Logrono failed to explode late on Sunday after only the detonator ignited, Spanish news media reported on Monday. The group telephoned a warning to a Basque newspaper at 11 pm (2100 GMT) and 30 minutes later a small explosion was heard in a car park in the city, the capital of the Rioja region adjacent to the Basque country. News media quoted police sources as saying there could have been between 100 and 150 kg (220 and 330 lb) of explosives in the bomb, which was later deactivated. Hours earlier, the separatist group vowed to keep up bomb attacks against the Spanish state, saying last year's unsuccessful peace talks showed there was no point in negotiating with the Socialist government. In the Basque city of San Sebastian, police broke up a rally on Sunday in support of ETA prisoners and arrested the leader of an amnesty movement and five other people.
