 Dhaka, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com)A team of BTRC and RAB officials have seized illegal Voice over Internet Protocol equipment worth Tk 4 crore in six separate raids in Sylhet. Five special teams of RAB, in raids in six areas of the city, seized the VoIP equipment, including 392 fixed wireless terminals and 20 VoIP gateways operated by Jalalabad Telecom and BTS Communications. Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission filed cases with Gulshan and Tejgaon police stations against Jalalabad Telecom and BTS Communications, the telecom watchdog said in a statement Monday.

In a raid Thursday last, the RAB officers seized two Quintum gateways, a computer, UPS and stabiliser from a rented house beside Varthakhola Mouchak Market in the city. Kamal Hossain of Musargaon was running the illegal VoIP services from his house. The second round of raids was conducted Friday morning at houses in Khuliapara, Chandantula, Zindabazar Puran Lane and Ambarkhana Bara Bazar in the city. Details on other raids were sketchy.
