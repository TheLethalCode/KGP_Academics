<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 6 (bdnews24.com)  The government has moved to enact a law for bail to detained family members of the politicians arrested on corruption charges. "A proposal on a law to this end has been tabled at the law ministry for review. A final decision will be taken soon," law adviser Mainul Hosein said Thursday at his law ministry office. He added the government would make some amendments to the emergency powers rules as well. Mainul ruled out any more lists of graft suspects in future. "The 230 people so far enlisted as graft suspects will be dealt with. Those beyond the lists would be taken care of in line with the law." The Anticorruption Commission will see to the matter, he said. Asked to comment on the meeting that deposed BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan had Wednesday with so-called the reformists despite a ban on indoor politics under the state of emergency, Mainul said he did not know about the meeting. "It's the jurisdiction of the home ministry. They will deal with it." The adviser said chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed and army chief General Moeen U Ahmed at a meeting with business leaders Wednesday asked businessmen to work without fear. "They would not be harassed." bdnew
