 Dhaka, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com) - Widespread flooding has inundated many areas of the country again, disrupting efforts to rebuild certain regions still recovering from the early monsoon deluge in July and August. Many communities, still reeling from the earlier flooding, have been forced to search for temporary shelter again. Most of the country has experienced moderate to heavy rain over the last few days leading to rising water levels in all rivers of the country. At least 10 rivers are now flowing above their danger levels. Areas adjacent to Kaptail Lake in Rangamati have been submerged over the last 48 hours, leaving about 30,000 people marooned. The well-known suspension bridge on the lake is now under water. The main road link between Chittagong and Rangamati was cut off when a bridge collapsed under the huge volume of water. Road communication between Feni and Parshuram upazila was also severed by the rising water. bdnews24.com's Chittagong office said about 100 fish farms have been inundated by a surging tide on the Bay of Bengal. Most of the aman seedbeds in Raozan, Satkania, Chandanaish and Patia are now under water. The Nilphamari correspondent reports: "All rivers in the district have been flowing dangerously high following three days of incessant rainfall and flash flooding to the north." The Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre said Saturday: "Bangladesh and West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Bihar in India have been experiencing moderate to heavy rain under the impact of the active monsoon. The rainfall will continue for the next 24 hours." In the Brahmaputra basin, the Dharla, Teesta and Jamuna rivers were flowing 62, 70 and 35cm above their danger levels at 6am Friday, according to the FFWC. The Padma was flowing 25cm above the red mark at Goalundo point. The Surma was flowing 150cm above danger level at Kanaighat point and the Kushiara 137cm above its critical point at Amalshid point. The Muhuri was flowing 85cm above the danger mark at Parshuram point and the Halda 140cm above danger level at Narayanhat in Chittagong. bdnews24.com's Sirajganj correspondent said: "River erosion can be seen at Shailabari and Simla as well as Meghai and Shubhagacha as the Jamuna water continues to rise." bdnews24.com's Feni correspondent added: "A vast area in Parshuram upazila has been inundated by the swelling Muhuri river." bdnews24.com/cor
