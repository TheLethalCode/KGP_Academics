 Dhaka, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com)  Offices of the left-leaning political parties Monday seemed to be waking up gradually from the spell of 'no politicking' that was enforced from the day emergency was declared. Following the withdrawal of restrictions imposed on indoor politics Sunday night, leaders and workers of different leftist parties flocked to their offices, exchanged greetings and attended to official chores. "We've started our regular official activities. A number of our leaders and workers came to the office and soon we'll start preparing for the CPB central committee meeting and national council congress," CPB general secretary Mujahidul Islam Selim told bdnews24.com. "Restrictions imposed on the freedom of speech of people and full-scale political activities should also be lifted as soon as possible," Selim said, hailing the lifting of the embargo. Leaders and workers of the Workers' Party, including its president Rashed Khan Menon and general secretary Bimal Biswas and most of the Politburo members thronged their Topkhana Road office. Menon told bdnews24.com: "We welcome the chief adviser's move lifting the ban on indoor politics. But the decision of allowing political deliberations on a limited scale will hardly let us breathe freely." He said they expected the CA's promises would be fully implemented. bdnews24.c
