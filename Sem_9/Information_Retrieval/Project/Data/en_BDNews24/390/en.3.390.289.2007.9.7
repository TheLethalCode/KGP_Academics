<TEXT>
 STOCKHOLM, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sweden's prime minister plans to meet top Muslim diplomats to try to defuse a row over the publication of a drawing of the Prophet Mohammad that several countries have denounced, his office said on Thursday. Prime Minister Frederik Reinfeldt invited diplomats from around 20 Muslim countries to meet on Friday, a spokesman said, following protests in Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan and other states over a drawing depicting Prophet Mohammad's head on the body of a dog. Muslims believe images of the Prophet are forbidden and also consider dogs to be impure. Swedish daily Nerikes Allehanda published the drawing on Aug. 24 in what it called a defence of free speech after Swedish galleries declined to display a series of works, including the Mohammad drawing, by Swedish artist Lars Vilks. Iran then summoned Sweden's charge d'affaires in Tehran to lodge a protest. Pakistan and other states soon followed suit. "We have taken this initiative to continue our dialogue with these countries regarding this issue," the spokesman for the prime minister said. Reinfeldt invited the diplomats to meet with him on Friday. Swedish flags were burnt during demonstrations in Pakistan last week, although protests by Muslims in Sweden have so far been peaceful. Last year cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammad in a Danish newspaper, later reprinted by other newspapers in Europe, led to a storm of protests as well as boycotts in Muslim countries of Danish products.
