 Dhaka, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com)  Expelled BNP joint secretary general Ashraf Hossain Thursday claimed that Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan remained the legal secretary general of the party. "We will represent the party in any dialogue with the Election Commission," Ashraf said. The ousted BNP leader briefed reporters following a meeting with Bhuiyan at his Gulshan home. "According to BNP's constitution, anyone facing expulsion from party membership or any other post must be given the opportunity to defend themselves," he said. "Nobody can be expelled without completing this process first. The way the decision was made public through a lawyer after the chairperson was arrested is totally illegal." Ashraf said: "We constitute the mainstream BNP, we represent the party. Mannan Bhuiyan is our legitimate secretary general." "Khandaker Delwar Hossain's instatement as BNP's secretary general is illegal. "The Election Commission has not yet asked for formal talks. We will make a decision about this after we get a letter from them." "The letter sent to the Election Commission on Khandaker Delwar Hossain's behalf has no legality at all." "After the emergency is lifted we will implement our reforms through the party council. The party will then be free from authoritarian leadership and joint leadership will be established," he said. bdnews24
