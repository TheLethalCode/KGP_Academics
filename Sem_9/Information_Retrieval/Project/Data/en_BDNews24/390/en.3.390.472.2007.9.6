 LONDON, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Jude Law has been arrested on suspicion of attacking a photographer outside his London home, his lawyer and police said on Wednesday. Law, 34, back from the Venice Film Festival showing of his new film 'Sleuth,' went voluntarily to Marylebone Police Station in central London after the incident on Tuesday and was released on police bail. "Mr Law provided the police with a statement regarding his denials of allegations by a 'paparazzi' photographer against him and made his own allegations concerning the photographer," said Law's solicitor Graham Shear. "Jude has the utmost respect for the police and whilst this is an ongoing matter no further comment will be made." London's Scotland Yard police headquarters said a 34-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of actual bodily harm. "The arrest followed an allegation of assault outside a residential address," a police spokesman said. "The man has been released on bail ... pending further inquiries." Law, the star of 'The Talented Mr Ripley' and the 2004 remake of 'Alfie,' appears with Michael Caine in 'Sleuth,' itself a rewrite of the original 1972 thriller. Law is not the first British actor to get into trouble over an alleged altercation with a photographer. Hugh Grant was arrested in April and questioned by police after a photographer accused the British actor of attacking him with a tub of baked beans near the actor's London home. But the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to press charges against the star of 'Four Weddings and a Funeral,' saying there was too little evidence with discrepancies between the accounts of what happen
