 Dhaka, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com)  Booters except chief coach Syed Nayeemuddin leave Dhaka for Cox's Bazar Friday morning for a month-long residential camp for upcoming three meets . Bangladesh's Indian coach Nayeemuddin stayed back at home to be with his family after Bangladesh national team's Nehru Cup campaign last month. Nayeemuddin was scheduled to return here Thursday but he could not leave Kolkata for not having the Bangladesh visa. "He did not get the Bangladesh visa till Wedneday and is scheduled to appear in the Bangladesh embassy today (Thursday) again in Kolkata," said the Bangladesh Football Federation acting general secretary Manzoor Hossain Malu Thursday. "We have sent a letter to the Bangladesh embassy in Kolkata with a request to take necessary step for Nayeemuddin's visa," Malu added. Nayeemuddin, who coached Brothers Union in the inaugural professional football league, became a defaulter due to his five- month overstay in Bangladesh and the BFF settled the issue by paying about Tk 50,000 as fine last month. The BFF Wednesday picked 33 footballers ahead of World Cup prequalifiers against Tajikistan (October 8 and 22), the Grand Royal Challenge Cup in Myanmar (November 1-7) and SAFF Championship in Sri Lanka and Maldives (December 10-22). The booters will gear up themselves in the sandy beach in Cox's Bazar under the guidance of local coaches Hasanuzzaman Bablu, Golam Jilani and Nayeemuddin. But Nayeemuddin is yet to return.
