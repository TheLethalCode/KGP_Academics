 Dhaka, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com)  Home secretary Abdul Karim Thursday said action would be taken against Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan if he had violated emergency powers rules by using loudspeakers at his Gulshan home. Bhuiyan, expelled as BNP secretary general by chairperson Khaleda Zia Monday, held a meeting Wednesday at his Gulshan home where loudspeakers were used. Reporters asked Karim whether Bhuiyan had violated the emergency powers rules and whether the home ministry would take action and he replied: "If the emergency powers rules were violated, action would definitely be taken. We have to check." Karim's remarks came in a briefing to reporters after a meeting on "Raising public awareness for prevention of militant activities" at the home ministry. After the meeting, the home secretary said: "Islam is a religion of peace. Islam does not support extremism and militant activities. Islam is a complete way of life, not a way of death. "Awareness programmes are being organised with teachers of madrasas, schools, and colleges, imams of mosques, chairmen and members of the Union Parishads to prevent militant activities." He sought cooperation from the media for creating anti-militancy awareness. Different ministries put forward some proposals on anti-militancy publicity at the meeting chaired by Karim. Representatives from the law, information, finance, religious affairs and local government ministries and senior officers of law-enforcement agencies attended the meeting. bdnews24.com
