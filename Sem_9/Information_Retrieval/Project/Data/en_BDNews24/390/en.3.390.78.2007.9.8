<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com) New BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain has categorically said that no-one can force party reforms through political posturing. On the other hand, recently ousted Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan who still claims to be secretary general said the image of the BNP can only be retrieved through reforms. Delwar and Bhuiyan aired their views separately Saturday at press conferences held at their homes. Delwar told reporters: "Khaleda Zia is still leading the same party that was founded by Ziaur Rahman. It is the mainstream. There is no stream outside it". "BNP reforms will take place only with the consent of the party council in line with the party constitution. There can be no reform through hints or political gestures on anybody else's part." Contradicting Delwar's assertions, Bhuiyan claimed: "We represent the mainstream BNP founded by Ziaur Rahman. Most of the BNP leaders and workers are with us." "The party will be reformed through the council session. We will retrieve the ideals of BNP through reforms," Bhuiyan said. bdnews24.com/
