 Gaibandha, Sep 10 (bdnews24.com)  Agriculture adviser CS Karim Monday warned banks that they would face legal action unless flood-hit farmers get loans in two days into application. The adviser sounded the warning from a meeting organised by the disaster management committee at Gaibandha Deputy Commissioner's Office. Karim gave out relief among the flood affected and visited medical facilities for them in Fulchhari Upazila of the district. He told bank officials: "Applications of loans by flood-affected farmers should be processed and disbursed within two days. Otherwise, legal actions would be taken." "Flooding is a natural calamity. We can't stop it. However, we need to tackle this disaster bravely. The first phase of floods was confronted by joint efforts of governmental and non-governmental organisations. We will deal with the second phase likewise," he said. The adviser earlier visited some flood-stricken areas of Kurigram district. He distributed Tk 4.71 lakh in cash aid among 357 flood victims at Madhyakumarpur of Sadar Upazila and at Nageshwari of Berubari Upazila of the district. CS Karim also met officials from the district administration at Rangpur Circuit House and went to Nowhali union of Gangachara Upazila. He talked to the flood-hit people there and promised steps about river erosions. Water Development Board executive engineer Babul Chandra Sheel, assistant general manager of Janata Bank Khalilur Rahman and civil surgeon Dr Shamsul Haque also spoke at the meeting chaired by deputy commissioner Kazi Md Anwarul Hakim. bdnews24.com/c
