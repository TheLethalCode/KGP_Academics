 BERNE, Switzerland, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European soccer's governing body UEFA has fined five clubs over crowd trouble during the final qualifying round for the Champions League. Belgium's Anderlecht were hardest hit as UEFA handed out a 20,000 Swiss francs ($16,526) fine after fans threw missiles and attempted to invade the pitch during their second leg defeat against Turkish side Fenerbahce in Brussels. Fenerbahce, who went through 3-0 over the two legs, were fined 8,000 Swiss francs for their supporters setting off fireworks. Italy's Lazio and Romania's Dinamo Bucharest were fined 12,000 and 9,000 Swiss francs respectively for incidents involving fireworks during their third round meeting. Lazio went through to the group stage as 4-2 aggregate winners. UEFA's disciplinary committee made no mention of racist behaviour at either match despite media reports of chanting by Anderlecht, Fenerbahce and Lazio. Red Star Belgrade were also given a 10,000 Swiss francs fine by the committee after their supporters threw missiles during their qualifier against Rangers, which ended in a 1-0 overall victory for the Glasgow side
