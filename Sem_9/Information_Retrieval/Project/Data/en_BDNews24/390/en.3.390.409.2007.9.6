 LONDON, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The International Cricket Council (ICC) has defended umpire Peter Hartley after England skipper Paul Collingwood was controversially run out during the defeat by India in Wednesday's one-day international. Collingwood set off for a risky single and appeared to be struggling to make his ground when India wicketkeeper MS Dhoni whipped off the bails. Though Hartley initially declined to call for the third umpire, he changed his mind after a replay on the Oval's big screen showed Collingwood was out. The England captain was duly sent to the pavilion having scored just one run. Collingwood was clearly angry at the circumstances but the ICC said Hartley had not broken any protocol. "There is nothing to prevent an umpire reversing his decision as long as it is before the next ball has been bowled," an ICC spokesman said on Thursday. "The way he got to the decision was not ideal but the fact is that the right decision (to give Collingwood out) was made. "He should have referred the decision straight away but he had the presence of mind to refer it once he realised his mistake and the right decision was made. "Imagine if he had not referred it when Collingwood was clearly out." The ICC also stressed that no India players requested Hartley, who was officiating his first one-day international, to refer the decision to the third umpire. India went on to reach their target of 317 to win the match with two balls and two wickets to spare. The series stands at 3-3 before Saturday's final match at Lord's
