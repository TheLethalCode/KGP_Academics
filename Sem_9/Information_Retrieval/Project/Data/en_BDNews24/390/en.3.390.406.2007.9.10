 Dhaka, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com) -- The World Bank Monday offered a $75 million interest free credit in budgetary support to help the government meet the flood-related emergency spending. "Floods in Bangladesh have become quite serious. We are providing the budget support so that government can put it in place and meet additional expenditure needed for the flood recovery," World Bank country director Zian Zhu said in a press briefing in his office. The fund will help the government meet non-programmed flood-related spending and face "any unforeseen pressure on the foreign exchange reserves", the WB said. The 2007 floods, according to WB, affected 39 of the country's 64 districts resulting in the loss of over 600 lives, rocked shelters of millions, damaged standing crops and affected the infrastructure including roads and embankments. An outbreak of diarrhoea due to a lack of safe drinking water and damage to latrines also created health problems in the flood-affected regions. "The government relief effort is putting a strain on its fiscal year 2008 budget. Expenditures earmarked for the development activities and being redirected for flood relief," Zhu said. He said WB had assessed the damage caused by the floods. "We are regularly monitoring the flood situation. We have put forward a two-pronged financial assistance strategy to contribute flood relief effort," he said adding that the agency would first provide support for budget and then start working for rehabilitation. "If everything goes smoothly, we hope to release the fund by October," Zhu said. Zhu hoped the government would meet half of its requirements for flood-related expenses after it received the fund from WB. The government earlier sought $150 million from donors to meet its flood-related expenditure, he said. The maturity period of the interest-free credit is 40 years with a 10-year grace period. bd
