 Dhaka, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com)  CSB News staffers spent a gloomy day at office Friday after the government Thursday halted its transmission on charges of forging a no-objection certificate. The journalists crowded their Uttara office from morning, said its officials. "Even if transmission remains stopped for seven days we will keep the office open and carry on with our normal work," head of output Probhas Amin told bdnews24.com Friday. "There was no work today. There was no planning for Friday as the transmission was stopped abruptly on Thursday," said Amin. The government based its decision to halt transmission on charges of channel authorities fraudulently obtaining air frequency allocation by forging the approval papers of the information ministry. The order was implemented at 6:35pm after four officials of Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission visited the private station's headquarters in Uttara with the notice for suspension. More than 150 of the channel's journalists gathered at the office Thursday evening and some broke down in tears. The BTRC asked authorities to explain in seven workdays why the frequency allotted to the channel should not be cancelled. The information ministry's no-objection certificate for transmission of news and programmes to the channel's owners, Focus Multimedia Ltd, has also been cancelled. "However, all other work except transmission will resume in a day or two," Amin said. "At the same time the work on the approval papers will be complete in line with BTRC directives." Hummam Quader Chowdhury, a director of Cronus Satellite Broadcast (CSB), told bdnews24.com Friday evening: "The transmission has remained stopped at the directive of the BTRC. However, our office work is going on." "There is restriction on news gathering," he added. Chowdhury said they were consulting lawyers to prepare a reply to the BTRC notice. The country's first 24-hour news channel, owned by Focus Multimedia Ltd, began transmission on March 26 this year. bdnews24.co
