 NEW DELHI, Sept 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's ruling coalition would win an election if snap polls were held, with inflation and farming issues far more important for voters than a controversial U.S. nuclear deal, a survey released on Sunday showed. The coalition, in power for about three years, is led by the Congress Party but opposition to the U.S. civil nuclear deal from its communist allies in parliament has led to talk of a political crisis and speculation an early election could be called. The survey, by the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies for the Indian Express and CNN-IBN television, found that the United Progressive Alliance would win at the expense of Hindu nationalist opposition and communist parties. The survey showed the coalition could gain 267 parliament seats, compared to the 222 it won in May 2004 when it swept to power in a shock election win over a coalition led by the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The BJP-led opposition coalition, which has suffered internal divisions and a leadership crisis, would win 133 seats, down from 189 in 2004. The left parties, which prop up the ruling coalition in parliament, would win 43 seats, also a drop from the 2004 elections. But the newspaper warned that there were signs of growing voter discontent over India's economy, especially at rising prices and the ruling coalition performed worse than in a January survey, when it was forecast to win around 300 seats. Sunday's poll showed that 36 percent of voters said inflation and the condition of farmers -- India's population is mostly rural -- were the main election issues. The civilian nuclear deal with the United States was the main issue for only six percent of voters. Sixty-four percent of those surveyed had not even heard of the nuclear pact, which aims to lift a three-decade ban on sales of U.S. nuclear fuel and reactors to India, imposed after it conducted a nuclear test in 1974 while staying out of non-proliferation agreements. While the deal has been hailed as historic by Washington and New Delhi, the communists say it compromises India's sovereignty and imposes American hegemony. Only 14 percent of voters wanted an early election, the survey said. The survey comes as India's economy has been booming over the past three years, but the government has faced pressure from leftist coalition parties to tone down its market-friendly reforms and do more for millions of the country's poor. The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), a party championing the lowest castes that scored a surprise win in elections in India's most populous state of Uttar Pradesh in May, would more than double its votes from the last election to 35 seats, the survey found. The BSP is led by Mayawati, a fiery former teacher who is considered a rising star on India's political stage. The next general election had been expected in 2009, before a crisis over the nuclear deal sparked talk of earlier elections. The survey, conducted Sept 1-4, is based on interviews with 18,750 people in towns and villages in 18 of India's 29 states.
