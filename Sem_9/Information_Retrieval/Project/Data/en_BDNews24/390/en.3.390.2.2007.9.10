<TITLE> Ronaldinho strike lifts Brazil to victory over U.S. </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CHICAGO, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ronaldinho scored the decisive goal from a free kick as Brazil came from behind to beat a feisty United States 4-2 in a friendly on Sunday. The Barcelona forward curled the ball through a gap into the wall to put Brazil 3-2 ahead in the 75th minute, two minutes after Clint Dempsey had scored for the hosts to make it 2-2 in an entertaining game on a hot afternoon. A last-minute penalty converted by substitute Elano completed Brazil's win in a match between the respective Copa America and CONCACAF champions. Brazil head coach Dunga said the game against an improving American side had been a good test for his team, who begin World Cup qualifiers in October. "It was difficult for us because of the temperature and a lot of our players are still (getting into shape after the) preseason. The U.S. is a very tactical team and very disciplined, even when they're behind on the scoresheet," Dunga told reporters. The U.S. opened the scoring in the 21st minute when Landon Donovan's corner deflected in off the chest of defender Carlos Bocanegra. Brazil equalized in the 33rd minute through an Oguchi Onyewu own goal. Kaka's shot was saved by U.S. keeper Tim Howard but cannoned off Onyewu into the net. Lucio's far-post header from a Ronaldinho corner put Brazil 2-1 ahead in the 53rd minute. Howard dislocated a finger as he leapt to make the save but he stayed on the pitch after several minutes of treatment. Howard made impressive saves from Afonso and Kaka to keep the game close. U.S. striker Josh Wolff had a penalty claim waved away in the 68th minute. Bocanegra, who committed the foul on Daniel Alves that led to Ronaldinho's decisive free kick, felt the Americans did enough to earn at least a draw. "I didn't think the scoreline represented that game," he said. "It's difficult. The non-call on the penalty and their two dead-ball goals that came off of not much. It's frustrating when we did play so well, to not get something from that game." Brazil complete their U.S. tour with a friendly against Mexico on Wednesday in Boston
