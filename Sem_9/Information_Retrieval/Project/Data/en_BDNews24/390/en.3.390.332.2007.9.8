 MODENA, Italy, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thousands of Luciano Pavarotti's grieving fans are expected at the tenor's funeral on Saturday, including rock stars and world statesmen who want to honour a man who took opera to the masses. The imposing, bearded opera star, whose captivating voice touched millions, died of cancer on Thursday at the age of 71. His funeral is scheduled for 3:00 p.m. (1300 GMT) at the 12th century cathedral in the historic centre of his home town in northeastern Italy. U2 frontman Bono, one of several rock and pop singers to have performed with Pavarotti, confirmed he would attend and former United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan is also expected, according to city officials. On behalf of the Italian state, Prime Minister Romano Prodi and other government officials will be present. Some of Pavarotti's friends from the world of opera including blind Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli and Bulgarian soprano Raina Kabaivanska are to sing at the funeral, which will be broadcast live by state television. Pavarotti's voice may also ring out at the funeral, local media reported, saying organisers were considering playing a recording of him singing the hymn "Panis Angelicus" ("bread of angels") with his father. Tens of thousands of mourners have been paying their last respects to the "Maestro" since Thursday when his body was put on display at the cathedral in the town's historic centre. Condolences have come from around the world. U.S. President George W. Bush and Russia's Vladimir Putin joined opera singers Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras in praising Pavarotti. "Big Luciano", as he was endearingly called in Italy, achieved superstardom at the celebrated "Three Tenors" concert with Domingo and Carreras in Rome during the 1990 soccer World Cup in Italy. "Nessun Dorma" will be played ahead of Euro 2008 soccer matches by the Italian and English national teams on Saturday. Pavarotti had surgery for cancer in New York in July 2006, then retreated to Modena where he had two weeks of treatment in hospital last month before going home for the last time. The tenor will be laid to rest at the Montale Rangone cemetery near his villa outside of town, where his parents and his stillborn son Riccardo are buried.
