 PARIS, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French Interior Minister Michele Alliot-Marie said on Thursday that police services in the Paris region would step up coordination to halt a rise in clashes between youth gangs. The centre of Paris has been the scene of repeated scuffles between rival gangs in recent months that have revived memories of the weeks-long riots in French suburbs in 2005, and violent student protests in Paris last year. "It's a phenomenon that we have known for a long time and which has re-emerged," Alliot-Marie said after a meeting with local prefects from the Paris region and police representatives to discuss gang violence. France's police intelligence service has said 129 violent clashes were recorded in the first five months of the year, 29 percent up on the same period last year. Alliot-Marie announced the creation of a special police cell on youth violence and said information collected through video surveillance should be shared among different services. Prime Minister Francois Fillon said this week France planned to step up security at the capital's Gare du Nord station, which was the venue of fighting last Sunday. President Nicolas Sarkozy's government has already pushed through a law imposing harsher sentences on repeat offenders. Sarkozy, a law-and-order hardliner, won criticism and praise for his tough handling of the suburban riots in 2005, when he was interior minister under a previous conservative government. Paris prosecutor-general Laurent Le Mesle said punishment for violent youngsters had to be tough and swift. "(Sanctions) will not only be tougher but they also should be as immediate as possible," he told the Le Parisien daily. Le Mesle said the authorities had not been prepared for the surge in violence in Paris, adding the recent clashes showed "groups (were) leaving their respective territories to come settle their scores in Paris. This is rather new and worrying." On Wednesday, the daily Le Monde quoted France's police intelligence service as saying in a report that gang clashes were mainly linked to turf battles, but that there was also a "noticeable return of the phenomenon of ethnic gangs mainly composed of individuals of sub-Saharan origin".
