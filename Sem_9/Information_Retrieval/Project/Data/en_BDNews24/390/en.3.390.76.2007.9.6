 LONDON, Sept 6 (bdnews24/Reuters) - European stocks slipped by midday on Thursday ahead of comments from the European Central Bank (ECB) expected to shed light on the future of borrowing costs after both the ECB and the Bank of England kept rates steady. At 1220 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.4 percent at 1,516.71 points, losing ground after the Bank of England (BoE) maintained rates at 5.75 percent but flagged its concern over prices. Investor attention shifted to the European Central Bank, whose president, Jean-Claude Trichet, is due to begin a news conference at 1230 GMT after keeping rates steady at 4 percent. All the economists polled by Reuters last month expected the BoE to keep rates at 5.75 percent and most saw the ECB holding at 4 percent, and the probability of rate increases had fallen drastically from surveys done before credit conditions worsened. Bank stocks were the top negative weight on the European index, cancelling out the effect of gains in commodity stocks. Royal Bank of Scotland slipped 2.7 percent, Barclays 2.8 percent and BNP Paribas 2.2 percent. Fortis Bank strategist Bart Robenek said he still expected the ECB to raise rates this year. "If money markets stabilise there will be no excuse not to raise rates, and if inflation picks up they will not wait to increase rates with European economic figures being so strong," he said. "Euribor three-month rates at 4.72 percent are still too high -- they will wait for this to stabilise." Global stock markets have been roiled by tight credit market conditions stemming from a crisis in the US market for subprime, or risky, mortgages that hit financial shares especially hard. European shares are up around 3 percent so far this year, recovering after the US Federal Reserve cut its discount rate on Aug. 17, but are still down more than 6 percent from a 6-1/2 year peak hit in mid-July. CONSOLIDATION, PRICES DRIVE COMMODITIES Commodity stocks were the top-weighted gainers on the FTSEurofirst 300, with miner Rio Tinto climbing steeply on persistent market talk that rival BHP Billiton planned to ally with Brazil's CVRD to make a bid. Rio, whose stock rose 3.3 percent to lead percentage gainers in Europe, declined to comment. BHP gained 1.5 percent. Other miners also advanced, with Anglo American putting on 1.8 percent, Lonmin 3 percent and Kazakhmys 1.5 percent. Brent crude gained 33 cents to just under $75 a barrel, lifting index heavyweight oil shares. BP gained 0.5 percent, Total 0.4 percent and Royal Dutch Shell 0.6 percent. Overnight interbank lending rates, which have spiked sharply as banks hesitate to lend to each other due to uncertainty about subprime exposure, slipped before the ECB decision. The overnight euro deposit rate dipped to 4 percent, at the ECB's target level, as the bank stepped in with an emergency injection of 42.2 billion euros. "Psychological problems in the interbank markets can lead to problems in the real economy with banks not lending to each other and then hesitating to stand loans to individuals and companies," said Philippe Gijsels, another strategist at Fortis Bank.
