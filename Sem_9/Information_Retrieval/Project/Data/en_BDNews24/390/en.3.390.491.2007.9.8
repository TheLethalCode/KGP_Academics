 Dhaka, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com)-- Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Saturday called on all to work together for higher literacy rate in the country. At a programme marking International Literacy Day at Osmani Memorial Auditorium, he said the government was planning to set the adult literacy level at 90 percent by 2015. "We need educated citizens to build a corruption free, honest leadership. All our people will have to be enlightened with education. They will keep the economic wheel rolling and practice proper democracy," the CA said in his speech. "We should emphasise moral education at the primary level. Children should learn lessons on patriotism, discipline, honesty and cleanliness. From the very beginning, they should learn to respect each other," he added. "According to the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), education will have to be meaningful, to boost economic growth and human development. From the strategic point, we are emphasising the rate of school admission, gender equality and quality education. We are also trying to ensure the right to education at all levels," he said. The CA said collective efforts were important to ensure quality education. bdnews24.c
