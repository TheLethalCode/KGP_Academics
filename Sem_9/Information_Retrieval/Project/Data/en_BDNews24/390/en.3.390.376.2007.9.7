<TITLE> Greek PM rules out coalition after Sept 16 poll </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ATHENS, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis said on Thursday he would not agree to a coalition if his party failed to win enough votes to form a government in a Sept. 16 election, raising the prospect of a poll rerun. Opinion polls show no party easily winning an outright parliamentary majority in the election, widely seen as crucial for the pace of reform that European Union member nation needs to catch up with its euro zone partners. During the only televised election debate involving the leaders of the country's biggest parties, Karamanlis said he saw no possibility of any coalition with the other four parties that opinion polls show could enter parliament. The surveys show the conservatives leading by two percentage points against the opposition socialists but neither seems set to reach the 42 percent mark needed for an outright majority. "Objective conditions for coalitions do not exist," Karamanlis said. He ruled out any coalition with the left as well as the far-right LA.O.S. party, which is expected to reach the three percent threshold and enter parliament for the first time. "We will have new elections if the government has no majority (in parliament)," he said. "Current conditions say the possibility of coalition does not exist." Karamanlis said while he did not want a new election, a rerun would be necessary to try to produce a strong government to push through reforms. Among envisaged reforms are changes to the education system and the introduction of private universities, and overhauling the ailing pension system which could mean merging pension funds and raising retirement age limits. Socialist leader George Papandreou, who favours a pro-business model coupled with solid welfare state, accused the government of covering up scandals, including one where pension funds bought overpriced state bonds. "(Karamanlis) did not expose the bond scandal. He covered it up," said Papandreou. The scandals and the government's reaction to destructive forest fires that killed 65 people have pushed voters towards the smaller parties, which urged voters during the debate to help them become power brokers.
