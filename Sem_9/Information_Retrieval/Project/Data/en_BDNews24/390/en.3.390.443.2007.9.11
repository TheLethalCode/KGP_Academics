 Dhaka, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com)  The caretaker government is considering to set a time-limit to complete its administrative reforms, a top civil servant said Tuesday. "The speeding up of the process will extend the benefit of the reforms already undertaken as well as those still to be implemented to the people as soon as possible," Kazi M Aminul Islam, acting secretary to the Chief Adviser's Office, told bdnews24.com by phone. "The caretaker government is eager to give people the benefit of the reforms in the shortest possible time," Islam said. "The government is therefore considering a time-limit for the completion of the reforms," he said. An official with the Cabinet Division said the establishment ministry introduced a 'citizen's charter' on Sept 3 as part of the reforms. All offices under the establishment ministry have posted a citizen's charter, which provides specific timeframes for public services. "The charter will be introduced in phases to the other ministries," the official said. A modern land registration system will also be introduced, which is intended to tighten the existing regulations that determine genuine owners of lands. The move will reduce the time needed to obtain complete land deeds. Home ministry officials said the police force has initiated a freer flow of views with local communities in an attempt to improve the law and order situation at the local level. The committee formed with secretaries to assist the process will sit with ministries separately to review progress on the work. The caretaker government has delegated oversight of the initiative to an advisory council committee, comprising finance, education, industry and health advisers. bdnews24.com/
