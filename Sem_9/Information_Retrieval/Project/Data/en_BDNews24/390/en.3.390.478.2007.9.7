 BERLIN, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany defender Philipp Lahm will miss Saturday's Euro 2008 qualifier against Wales in Cardiff after suffering a knee injury in training on Thursday. The German Football Association (DFB) said the Bayern Munich player was heading straight back home after straining ligaments in his left knee. Lahm had been due to play either at right back or in midfield against Wales on Saturday. His absence means a further headache for coach Joachim Loew, who is already without senior midfielders Michael Ballack, Torsten Frings, Bernd Schneider and Tim Borowski. Lahm will also miss Germany's friendly international against Romania in Cologne on Wednesday, the DFB said in a statement. Germany lead qualifying Group D with 19 points from seven matches, five points ahead of the Czech Republic in second place. Wales are down in fifth place with seven points from six games
