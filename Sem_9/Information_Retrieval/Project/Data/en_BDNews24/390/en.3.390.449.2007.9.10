 Dhaka, Sept 9 (bdnews24.com)  Acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman Sunday welcomed the withdrawal of a ban on indoor politics and asked the government to end emergency rule. "The government has made the right decision at the right time. I urge the government to consider whether the state of emergency can be withdrawn. No situation prevails in the country that requires emergency rules." He gave his reaction to journalists at his Gulshan home after chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed addressed the nation Sunday evening. Zillur said it appeared the government was sincere about holding elections in 2008. He said a decision on discussion with the Election Commission would be taken at the party's central working committee meeting. "We need to see what is in the letter of the Election Commission. A decision will be taken at the meeting of the working committee." Zillur said the working committee meeting will be convened with the consent of detained party chief Sheikh Hasina and at her direction. He also said the Awami League would also discuss the issue with the 14-party allies. "When the entire nation was concerned about political, social and economic situation, then the chief adviser has addressed the nation. The chief adviser has acknowledged each of the problems and outlined steps the government is taking to get over them." The acting chief said there is no division in Awami League. "All in the party are united." bdnews24.
