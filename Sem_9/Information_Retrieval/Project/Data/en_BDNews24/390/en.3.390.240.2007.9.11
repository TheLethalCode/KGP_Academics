<TEXT>
 DURBAN, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South African batsman Ashwell Prince has resigned as president of the South African Cricketers' Association (SACA) after alleged details of a meeting were published, reports said on Tuesday. Afrikaans-language newspaper Rapport claimed on Sunday that Prince, who is black, was among 30 players who signed a memorandum calling for an end to South Africa's racially influenced selection policies. On Tuesday, another Afrikaans paper, Die Burger, reported that Prince had resigned as SACA president. "I trusted people and that confidentiality has been broken," the paper quoted Prince as saying. "I was betrayed and used. "I feel strongly that SACA had nothing to do with this. But the fact that it could have been a player, or players, made me realise that I cannot represent people whom I cannot trust. "My standpoint about certain aspects of Cricket South Africa's policy has never been a secret. Those who conspired against me should have known it." Prince, 30, is part of the South Africa A squad that is touring India
