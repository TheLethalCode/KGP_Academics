 Dhaka, Sept 9 (bdnews24.com)  An insipid batting display saw Bangladesh suffer a six-wicket defeat to Kenya in their World Cup Twenty20 last warm-up match at Willowmoore Park, Benoni Sunday. Kenya raced to 117 for four with one ball to spare in reply to Bangladesh's paltry 116 all out in 16.3 overs. The bowlers, however, raised some hope of hunting down the Kenyans at one stage, but the total proved too little to defend. Opener Tamim Iqbal, after a lean patch, blasted his way into form by hitting a 41-ball 56 but other batsmen hardly troubled the scoreboard. Bangladesh ended their innings with a run rate of 7.03 an over with 3.3 overs to spare. Aftab Ahmed (17 off 10 balls) and Nadif Chowdhury (12 off 9 balls) made it into the double digits. Inform Nazimuddin (5), Mohammad Ashraful (1), Saqib Al Hasan (2), Alok Kapali (3), Mushfiqur Rahim (2), Mashrafee Bin Mortaza (5), Farhad Reza (3) and Syed Rasel (4) could not do justice to their reputation against the Kenyan medium pacers. Nehemiah Odhiambo was the pick of the Kenyan attack with three for 37 while Lameek Onyango, Thomas Odoyo and Rajesh Bhudia chipped in with two wickets each for 19, 21 and 24 runs. Skipper Steve Tikolo made a 28-ball 36 to lead Kenya whose openers David Obuya (21) and Collins Obuya (16) put on 41 runs. Ashraful grabbed two wickets for 19 runs in his four-over spell while Farhad Reza and Syed Rasel took one wicket apiece for 22 and 19. Mashrafee Bin Mortaza remained wicketless conceding 31 runs in four overs. bd
