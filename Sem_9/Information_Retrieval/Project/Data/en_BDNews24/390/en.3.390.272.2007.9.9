The Commission plans to introduce legislation next year to have emissions from new cars cut to an average 130 grams per kilometre by 2012. That would contribute to an overall aim of 120 g/km by 2012, against current levels of 163 g/km. Car makers have criticised the move as unfair and unrealistic, and called on the executive body of the European Union to push the deadline back to 2015 to give them more time. "As the public debate has become more intense, we've suddenly seen what can be achieved," Dimas said. "Just about every carmaker is now bringing out low-emission vehicles on the market -- and that is true for every segment."
