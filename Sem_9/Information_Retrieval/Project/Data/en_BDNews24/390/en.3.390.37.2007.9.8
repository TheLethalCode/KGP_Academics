<TITLE> Economic revival matters more than curbing inflation, BB governor says </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 8 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed Saturday said he believed a revival of the stagnant economy was more important than curbing the much-talked-about rising inflation. "The pace of economic growth has become a bit stagnant recently and we have to consider how to overcome that situation," Ahmed told a meeting held to discuss inflation at the BRAC Centre Inn. Ahmed said the recent flooding and anti-corruption drive had hit the economy hard after achieving impressive GDP growth of 6.7 percent in fiscal 2006-07. According to experts, the projected GDP growth rate for this fiscal year is 7 percent, although some of the interim government's initiatives combined with the floods may impede growth. Ahmed said the BB has planned to concentrate on improving the real sector economy, by which he meant farm output, and the informal sector, deficits in electricity production and infrastructural constraints. The central bank governor did not however dismiss the importance of controlling inflationary pressures. Prof SR Osmani from the University of Ulster in the United Kingdom said his reading of the situation led him to think that inflation has been rising in the country since 2001 partly due the central bank's policies. Osmani said: "Domestic inflation is not rising as a result of demand. The supply side and global trends may have fuelled inflationary pressure." "Bangladesh Bank should review its monetary policy as well as its exchange rates and foreign exchange reserve policies," he said. According to available data, point-to-point inflation reached a 10-year high in June of 9.2 percent. Food inflation figures from the same time show 9.8 percent. Ahmed said: "We plan to make monetary policy more flexible and pragmatic to ensure growth momentum as well curb inflation." Prof Wahiduddin Mahmud said Bangladesh has no option other than increasing agricultural output to avoid inflationary pressure in the long term. The renowned economist suggested an occasional withdrawal of import duties on essentials might help curb inflation. Prof Rehman Sobhan from the Centre for policy Dialogue, which organised the discussion, said: "You [the governor] should formulate a policy on broad-based consultations, rather than relying only on the International Monetary Fund." bd
