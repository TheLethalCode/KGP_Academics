<TITLE> Iraq group sets 10-day deadline for German hostage </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 DUBAI, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraqi militants said Germany had 10 days to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan or they would kill a German-Iraqi hostage, a video posted on the Internet said on Tuesday. The Arrows of Righteousness group released the man's mother, Hannelore Marianne Krause, in July. The video showed her apparently saying goodbye to her son, Sinan, before being released. "For the last time, we are giving 10 days to Germany to pull out its troops from Afghanistan or we will cut his throat," said a statement read by an off-camera militant. The woman was released because she had converted to Islam, the militant said. Krause, who was freed after 155 days in captivity, is married to an Iraqi physician. Her son is in his mid-20s and has dual German-Iraqi citizenship. Iraqi militants had threatened to kill the two, seized from their home in western Baghdad on Feb. 6, unless Germany withdrew its 3,000 troops from Afghanistan. The group has extended its deadlines several times in the past.
