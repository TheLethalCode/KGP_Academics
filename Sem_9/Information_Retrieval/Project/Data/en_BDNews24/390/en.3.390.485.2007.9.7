 LONDON, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fast bowler James Anderson has been drafted into England's squad for the Twenty20 World Cup as a replacement for injured all-rounder Ravi Bopara, the England and Wales Cricket Board said on Friday. Anderson, set to play in the final match of the one-day series against India at Lord's on Saturday, will fly to South Africa on Sunday providing England receive clearance from the International Cricket Council organisers. Bopara fractured his right thumb during Sunday's one-day international in Leeds and is out for four to six weeks. Fellow all-rounder Andrew Flintoff is also a doubt for the South African tournament because of a recurring ankle problem. The 29-year-old will have a fitness test on Saturday to see if he can play in the series-deciding one-dayer against India. India levelled the series 3-3 with a thrilling victory at the Oval on Wednesday
