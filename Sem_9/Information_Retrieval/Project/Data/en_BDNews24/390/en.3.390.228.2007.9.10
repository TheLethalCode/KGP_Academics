 LONDON, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England have named a 15-man squad for next month's one-day series in Sri Lanka, staying loyal to the players who sealed a 4-3 series win over India. The only new face in the party named on Monday was Nottinghamshire off-spinner Graeme Swann, who replaces fast bowler Chris Tremlett after a seven-year absence from the international scene. Sussex all rounder Luke Wright was rewarded for a half century on his debut against India last week with a spot in the squad while young Essex all rounder Ravi Bopara was included despite being ruled out of the Twenty20 World Cup with a fractured thumb. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) also revealed its central contracts for 2008 on Monday, with bowlers James Anderson and Ryan Sibebottom both making the 12-man list. "The team's series win on Saturday was particularly pleasing as our chances of beating India had been written off by many people before," chairman of selectors David Graveney said in an ECB statement. "The selectors were delighted with many aspects of the team's performance including Paul Collingwood's development as a captain, Ian Bell's batting, the energy shown in the field and the significant contributions made by the newer members of the squad; Ravi Bopara, Stuart Broad, Dimitri Mascarenhas, Owais Shah and Luke Wright." Graveney said Sidebottom, who like Bopara misses the Twenty20 World Cup because of injury, and Anderson have been rewarded with central contracts because of their form in the test matches and one-dayers over the summer. "Jimmy Anderson's form in both test and one-day cricket this summer has been impressive and we are also very pleased with the progress Ryan Sidebottom has made following his return to the international team earlier this season," Graveney said. As well as the 12 central contracts, the ECB has the option of offering six-month summer contracts to any players who perform well on overseas tours in the next few months. England squad for Sri Lanka series: Paul Collingwood (captain), James Anderson, Ian Bell, Ravi Bopara, Stuart Broad, Alastair Cook, Andrew Flintoff, Dimitri Mascarenhas, Monty Panesar, Kevin Pietersen, Matthew Prior, Owais Shah, Ryan Sidebottom, Graeme Swann, Luke Wright. List of England's central contracts for 2008: James Anderson, Ian Bell, Paul Collingwood, Alastair Cook, Andrew Flintoff, Stephen Harmison, Matthew Hoggard, Kevin Pietersen, Monty Panesar, Ryan Sidebottom, Andrew Strauss and Michael Vaughan
