<TITLE> Akhtar slams disciplinary committee over doping scandal </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JOHANNESBURG, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar has described the doping scandal that engulfed him last year as the worst time of his life and hit out at the disciplinary committee that initially found him guilty. The "Rawalpindi Express" and fellow paceman Mohammad Asif tested positive for the banned steroid nandrolone in internal testing by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) before the Champions Trophy last October. A PCB disciplinary committee banned Akhtar for two years and Asif for one year. The ban was overturned on appeal, however, as the committee had used the World Anti-Doping Agency Code (WADA) regulations instead of PCB's own anti-doping policy, which allows for ignorance of the law to be used as a defence. "The doping matter was pretty serious and a big setback for my entire life," he said on Thursday. "It was not easy to cope with." "It's difficult when you get into trouble," he said. "If I do it, then it is a problem, but if anyone else does it, they don't get into trouble." WADA lodged an appeal against the ruling with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), which found in July it did not have jurisdiction in the matter as neither PCB nor International Cricket Council provided for a right of appeal to CAS. "The Pakistan Cricket Board has helped, it was not their fault the case went wrong," said Akhtar, in South Africa for the inaugural Twenty20 World Cup. "The disciplinary committee turned out to be the main culprit." The 32-year-old also strongly criticised rules changes in the game, saying they have deprived fans of the joy of watching fast bowling. "Cricket should be about fast bowlers, not batsmen," he said. "The charm has gone down in cricket because you don't have fast bowlers running in and bowling at 90mph anymore. "The spectators like to see fast bowlers running in, hurting people, and pitches that make batsmen struggle for runs. "But nowadays we play on good batting tracks all the time; they've made laws about bouncers and now there's the free hit rule for a no-ball.
