<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com)  Breakaway Jatiya Party faction chief Roushan Ershad in a tit-for-tat move Friday expelled acting chairman Anisul Islam Mahmud and presidium member Ziauddin Bablu. The expulsion came a day after Mahmud, who was made makeshift party chief by founder H M Ershad a few months ago, Thursday removed eight top JP leaders including Roushan-led faction's secretary general Golam Mosih. "Roushan Ershad took the decision [of expelling them] at an urgent meeting Friday at her Command House home. The decision will come in force very soon," Mosih told bdnews24.com Friday. "[Mahmud and Bablu] have been expelled as they have acted in breach of party discipline. They were conspiring to destroy the party by creating divisions [among leaders and activists]," Mosih said. He said the two 'expelled' leaders were conspiring against some leaders who had been presidium members since inception of the party. On Thursday, Mahmud expelled JP presidium members Kazi Feroz Rashid, H M Gaffar, Tajul Islam Chowdhury, Golam Sarwar Milon, Golam Mosih, S M Alam, Fakhrul Imam and Moshiur Rahman Ranga on charges of breaching party discipline. Some of the leaders had joined Ferdous Ahmed Quraishi's new party styled Progressive Democratic Party. Ershad's decision to elevate Mahmud as the acting chairman apparently did not sit well with Roushan could who was quick to break away from her husband's party and float another faction. bdnews24.c
