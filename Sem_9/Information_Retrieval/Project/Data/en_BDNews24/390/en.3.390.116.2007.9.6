<TITLE> Despite Iraq stance, Germany moves up target list </TITLE>

 LONDON, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - If some Germans still believed their country's opposition to the Iraq war would spare it from militant Islamist bombings, they have suffered a rude awakening. Wednesday's news of a thwarted plot to carry out "massive bomb attacks" against US-linked targets in Germany followed months of stern warnings from authorities that the country faced a grave threat, including possible suicide attacks. Officials, long aware that Germany's troop presence in Afghanistan could make it a target, had become increasingly concerned in the past year about the training of German nationals at al Qaeda camps in Pakistan. If anything, security analysts said, the surprise was that the alleged plot was directed not primarily at Germans but against Americans on German soil. Suspects had scouted out sites such as discos, pubs and airports frequented by Americans. "Germany is in Afghanistan and it is a weak coalition patner," said Peter Neumann, a German national and director of the Centre for Defence Studies at King's College, London. "If you carried out a massive terrorist attack in Germany, probably this would alter the (public) attitude towards Germany's engagement in Afghanistan very significantly. Some of the Taliban leaders have argued along these lines and that's why I believe Germany is very much in the front line now." Germany has "moved up the ladder", becoming a more attractive target as the focus of the international jihadist movement has increasingly shifted to Afghanistan, Neumann said, where NATO forces are facing a resurgent Taliban. PAKISTAN LINKS Security analysts said there seemed to be significant Pakistani links to the German plot, with all three arrested suspects reported to have trained in militant camps there. They were also intrigued by the German federal prosecutor's statement that the three were members of the Islamic Jihad Union, an obscure group with roots in Uzbekistan that has not previously featured on Europe's militant landscape. "It could be a little bit of a change of pattern compared to the last couple of years where there were really homegrown, amateuristic, autonomous groups," said Edwin Bakker of the Clingendael Institute, a Dutch think-tank. "Perhaps now there's a stronger link with Pakistan, therefore also a stronger link with organisations instead of with al Qaeda as an 'idea'...The Pakistani connection is very interesting." Several militant Islamist plots in Britain have featured members of its large ethnic Pakistani community who travelled to their ancestral homeland for al Qaeda training. But the Pakistan link is newer to Germany, which has no such demographic ties to South Asia. Plots foiled by German authorities in recent years have often involved ties to Iraq. Two of the three men arrested in Germany were German nationals who converted to Islam, in line with a trend also observed elsewhere. Bakker, who has conducted a study of the backgrounds of militant Islamists convicted or accused of planning attacks in Europe, said about five percent were converts. "Converts are new believers, they want to over-compensate their failure to acknowledge God in the past, they are over-eager to become hardcore members," he said. The German arrests on Tuesday coincided with a major counter-terrorism operation in neighbouring Denmark in which eight people suspected of al Qaeda links were held. Two were later remanded in custody and six released. Although apparently unconnected, the cases highlight the diverse militant threat across the European Union, which has not got around to appointing a new anti-terrorism coordinator since Dutchman Gijs de Vries stepped down in March. "I don't think the risk has changed, I just think people are becoming more aware of it," said Nick Pratt of the George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies in Germany. "The problem is here, it's been here for a long time. You've got all these cases of homegrown radicals and people are finally beginning to realise the size and the scope of the proble
