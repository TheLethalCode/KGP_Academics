<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 9 (bdnews24.com)  Asian Development Bank (ADB) Sunday said the anti-corruption drive should in no way destabilise economic stability. "We should also try to mitigate any repercussion from any big corruption drive. We have to make sure that the [macro-economic] stability is maintained and the economy is not hurt by any of the short-term measures," Hua Du, ADB's country director, told reporters. She made the remarks at a meeting with foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury at the foreign ministry. The ADB director said success in fighting corruption could not be achieved overnight or over a few months or even a few years. She said the fight should be considered as long-term objective. Iftekhar told reporters that the ADB was providing a soft loan of US $150 million in technical assistance to fight corruption. "An inter-ministerial committee, headed by the foreign secretary, has been formed to find out the gap between the country's anti-corruption measures and the UN convention against corruption since Bangladesh is a signatory to the UN convention," Iftekhar said. He told bdnews24.com that the foreign ministry would develop an action plan in the line with the UN convention for fighting corruption. An inter-ministerial meeting within six months would find out the gaps, said the foreign adviser. "We have discussed how the ADB's assistance can be used to find out the gaps," Iftekhar said. bd
