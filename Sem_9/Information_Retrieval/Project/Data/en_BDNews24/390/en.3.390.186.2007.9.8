 ISLAMABAD, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Saad al-Hariri, son of assassinated Lebanese leader Rafik al-Hariri, was due to meet Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf on Saturday, apparently in connection with the return to Pakistan of a former prime minister. Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister army chief Musharraf ousted in 1999 and sent into exile the following year, is due to return from London on Monday. He has vowed to launch a campaign to end Musharraf's rule. The government has been trying to block Sharif's return, at least until after Musharraf tries to secure another term in a presidential election by the national and provincial assemblies some time between Sept. 15 and Oct. 15. The government has tried to press Sharif to stick to an agreement the government says he struck in 2000 to go into exile in Saudi Arabia and avoid a life sentence on hijacking and corruption charges. The government says the deal was guaranteed by Saudi leaders and Rafik al-Hariri. But Sharif says he made no deal with the government and is determined to return, along with his politician brother, Shahbaz. Saad al-Hariri has met Sharif in Britain recently, a spokesman for Sharif said, adding that Sharif had rejected a suggestion he postpone his return. An official in the president's office said al-Hariri had arrived at Musharraf's offices on Saturday for talks. Al-Hariri was later due to meet reporters, the official said. After the 1999 coup, Musharraf co-opted the rump of Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League party to form his political base, and analysts say that could splinter if Sharif were to return. Musharraf, whose popularity has plummeted since he tried to sack the chief justice in March, is trying to negotiate a power-sharing deal with another former prime minister in exile, Benazir Bhutto. A general election is due around the end of the year.
