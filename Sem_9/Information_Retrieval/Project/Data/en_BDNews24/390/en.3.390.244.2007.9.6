 LONDON, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India clinched a nailbiting two-wicket victory over England at the Oval on Wednesday, knocking off an imposing 317-run target to level the series at 3-3. Sachin Tendulkar scored a sensational 94 as India chased down England's daunting score but it was Robin Uthappa, a late call-up, who steered India home with two balls to spare thanks to his unbeaten 47. India, who got off to great start to their chase with Saurav Ganguly and Tendulkar putting on 150 for the first wicket, needed 10 off the last over. Uthappa, brought in to replace Dinesh Karthik, sprinted for two runs off the first ball but Stuart Broad then brilliantly ran out Zaheer Khan (0) off his own bowling. Showing no nerves, Uthappa flicked a full toss down the leg side for four and then thumped the fourth ball of the over past a despairing fielder to spark celebrations amongst thousands of Indian fans in the stadium. It was a stunning end to an absorbing contest full of dazzling strokes. After winning the toss and electing to bat on hard, fast surface, England's total was rescued from mediocrity by a maiden one-day international century by Owais Shah. He hit an unbeaten 107 from 95 balls but it was Dimitri Mascarenhas who rocketed England past the 300-barrier with booming sixes off the last five balls of the England innings bowled by the unfortunate Yuvraj Singh. England lost both openers inside the first four overs, Alastair Cook edging a pinpoint delivery from Zaheer to keeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni without scoring and Matt Prior (6) trapped lbw by Ajit Agarkar. Ian Bell and Kevin Pietersen repaired the damage with a 59-run partnership before Bell played across the line to young spinner Piyush Chawla and was bowled for a fluent 49 in the 17th over. CONTROVERSIAL DISMISSAL Next to fall was England skipper Paul Collingwood in controversial circumstances. Pietersen called Collingwood for a risky single and the skipper was clearly in trouble as Dhoni whipped off the bails. Umpire Peter Hartley was unmoved until a replay of the incident on the big screen showed that Collingwood was short of his crease. Hartley then called for the third umpire and an angry Collingwood was sent packing after scoring just one run. Pietersen then ludicrously ran himself out after scoring a 53, charging back for a second run that was never on. Shah continued to play beautifully in tandem with debutant Luke Wright, putting on a century stand for the sixth wicket. Wright, called in for the injured Andrew Flintoff, hit seven fours and a six in his 50 before a sharp run out by Uthappa. Shah reached his century in the penultimate over before Mascarenhas embarked on his five-ball onslaught that will live long in the memory. India set about their task with a flourish, Ganguly smashing Broad over his head for six after bringing up the 50 in the eighth over. Tendulkar cut loose at the other end, carving three consecutive boundaries off Collingwood to bring up his 83rd ODI half century. Broad broke the partnership when he had Ganguly caught at mid-off by Pietersen and a cramping Tendulkar went three overs later off the bowling of Monty Panesar. Gautam Gambhir kept India up with the run rate but wickets began to fall with Yuvraj Singh caught and bowled by Mascarenhas and captain Rahul Dravid getting a leading edge to the grateful hands of Collingwood off Shah for just four. India looked to be tottering when Gambhir skied a catch to Panesar on the boundary to leave them on 234 for five. Dhoni scratched around for 35 valuable runs to get India near the finish line before he was undone by the impressive Broad but Uthappa stood firm to clinch an epic vic
