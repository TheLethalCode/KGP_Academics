 Dhaka, September 11 (bdnews24.com) Dishonest and profiteering businessmen asking higher-than-market prices for daily foods and necessities during the holy month of Ramadan will be severely penalised, said food and disaster management adviser Tapan Chowdhury Tuesday. Speaking to reporters at the energy and power ministry, the adviser said: "The government will be compelled to take stern measures against dishonest and greedy businessmen and traders, who are found guilty of causing suffering to the people especially during Ramadan." Under the open market sale (OMS) programme, the government has already started selling rice at a price which is Tk 4-5 lower than the current market prices of coarse rice, he said. "Despite a sufficient flow of grain supplies on the domestic market, some unscrupulous traders create artificial scarcity of essentials and take advantage of the situation." Tapan, also power adviser, said a special monitoring team has been put in place to ensure a sustained supply of electricity during Ramadan. It will take steps to remedy any shortfall in power supply instantly and readily. Tapan said power supply during the Tarabih prayers (Ramadan-time special prayers) in all mosques will be ensured by installing 'double feeders' to handle any occurrence of 'single feeder failure'. Trolley-mounted transformers have been arranged to replace faulty transformers when required, the adviser said. The adviser warned shop-owners against consuming excess power during Ramadan by lighting decorative bulbs, adding that they will be allowed to keep their emporiums open for longer hours in view of the ensuing festivities. bdnews24.
