 Dhaka, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com) -- Election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain said Thursday that any political party or group meeting the registration conditions could begin discussions with the Election Commission on Sept 12. Talking with reporters at his Sher-e-Bangla Nagar office, the commissioner said: "The making or unmaking of political parties has always gone on." "This is not something for us to deal with. The Election Commission will sit with the original parties for discussions on electoral law reform." "The Election Commission will meet to discuss election laws and the constitution of political parties," he said. Sakhawat stressed that any new group or party would have to fulfil the conditions for registration prior to talks with the Election Commission. The commissioner also said he hoped the ban on indoor politics would be lifted before the EC opens the way to discussions with political parties. bdnew
