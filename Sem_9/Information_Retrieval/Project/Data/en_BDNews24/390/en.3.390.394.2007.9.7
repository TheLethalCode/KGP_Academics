 ABOARD USS KITTY HAWK, Bay of Bengal, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States hopes to build an alliance with friendly navies such as India's to form a global force of 1,000 ships and boost maritime security, a top US naval commander said on Friday. But Washington's naval cooperation with New Delhi is not intended to send a signal to Beijing and the US navy was not looking to build a base in the Indian Ocean region, Vice-Admiral Doug Crowder said. The comments by Crowder, commander of the Seventh Fleet, came midway through wargames involving five nations, led by the United States and India, in the Bay of Bengal, one of the biggest such peacetime exercises which has raised the hackles of China.

"But the United States navy just isn't large enough to do that." "We have to find common cause and every nation's sovereignty is protected. They join us for those missions they have a common interest in ... anti-piracy, humanitarian relief, security of the sea lanes." The six-day wargames which began on Tuesday, involving nearly 30 ships and over 100 aircraft, is the latest in a series called the "Malabar Exercise", first held in the mid-1990s between Indian and US forces. India's navy now has around 140 ships, compared with about 280 in the US navy. This year the drill has been expanded to include a few ships from Australia, Japan and Singapore in what some analysts see as a new alliance of democracies ranged against the growing military might of China. Although top officials from countries involved in the wargames have assured Beijing that it is not the focus of the exercise, China remains concerned by what it sees as a new security alliance that aims to encircle it. Crowder sought to once again underplay the strategic significance of the wargames, held not far from a Myanmar island where China is believed to have a military listening post. "This was not put together as a signal against anyone," Crowder said. Asked if Washington was looking to build new bases in the Indian Ocean region due to growing tensions in the Persian Gulf region and cooperation with navies such as India's, he said: "We're not looking to be in any certain place. We maintain the flexibility to take this fleet wherever we need to take i
