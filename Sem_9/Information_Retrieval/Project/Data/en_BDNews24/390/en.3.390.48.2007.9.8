 PORT OF SPAIN, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The longtime prime minister of the eastern Caribbean island of St. Lucia, Sir John Compton, died late on Friday after suffering a series of strokes in May that left him physically impaired. He was 81. The death of Sir John was announced in a radio statement to the island nation of 165,000, read out by acting Prime Minister Stephenson King. No date was announced for the funeral but King said there would be an official two week mourning period for the man labeled "father of the nation" by islanders. Sir John, who served as prime minister from 1964 to 1979 and again from 1982 to 1996, returned to active politics and regained the prime minister's post with a surprise victory in last December's general elections. He suffered a series of strokes in May. Two weeks ago, he began experiencing breathing problems and was flown to the nearby French island of Martinique for treatment. There doctors discovered that he had suffered another stroke. The veteran leader was hooked up on a respirator to help his breathing, and returned home where the island began preparing for his death.
