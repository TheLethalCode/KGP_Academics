<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com)  A blistering 74-run knock from Nazimuddin powered Bangladesh to a six-wicket win over Scotland in the World Cup Twenty20 warm-up match at Centurion in Pretoria Saturday. The right-handed opener clobbered three sixes and nine fours in 42 balls to remain unbeaten on 74. He took the Tigers to 148 for six with four overs to spare, chasing Scotland's fighting 145 for eight in 20 overs. The Scots struck a blow to Bangladesh in the very first over sending back opener Tamim Iqbal (8). But Nazimuddin and Aftab Ahmed put the team on solid footing, scoring 86 runs off just 50 deliveries. Aftab played a run-a-ball 33 with the help of five boundaries before he was stumped by Colin Smith off Ross Lyons, who also bowled Mohammad Ashraful (4) to reduce Bangladesh to 108 for three in 11.1 overs. Saqib Al Hasan (8) also failed to make an impact as he was bowled by Majid and Bangladesh were 126 for four in 12.5 overs. Alok Kapali remained unbeaten on 9 off as many deliveries with Nazimuddin. Earlier, Scotland chose to bat first after winning the toss and Navdeep Poonia topscored with 54. Left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak was the most successful Bangladesh bowler claiming two wickets for four runs in two overs. Saqib and Mashrafee Bin Mortaza also chipped in with two wickets apiece for 28 and 42 runs. bdnew
