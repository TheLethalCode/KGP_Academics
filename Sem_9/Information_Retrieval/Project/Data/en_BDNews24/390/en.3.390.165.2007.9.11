 ISLAMABAD, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Supporters of former Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif were due to petition the Supreme Court on Tuesday, seeking action against the government for deporting their leader to Saudi Arabia. Authorities deported Sharif on Monday hours after he returned home after seven years in exile, vowing to challenge President Pervez Musharraf as he prepares to seek another term in office. While Musharraf has succeeded in fending off an immediate challenge by deporting his rival, the move looks bound to trigger a showdown with the Supreme Court which last month ruled that Sharif had an "inalienable right" to come home. Musharraf's relations with the Supreme Court have been fraught since March when he tried to fire its top judge. The court reinstated the judge in July and last week began hearing challenges to Musharraf's rule as he prepares to seek re-election -- some time over the next month -- by an electoral college of national and provincial assembly members. Supporters of Sharif, who also clashed with the Supreme Court during his rule -- in 1997 his supporters stormed and ransacked the court -- are now looking to it for redress. "The government has committed a contempt of court and abducted the twice-elected prime minister of Pakistan and we are going to challenge this action in the court," said Khawaja Mohammad Asif, a senior official in Sharif's party. Musharraf ousted Sharif in a military coup in 1999 and the following year sent him to Saudi Arabia as part of what the government says was a deal that Sharif would stay in exile for ten years. Sharif was dogged by accusations of corruption during his two terms in the 1990s and an anti-corruption court last month reopened three cases against him. Government officials said Sharif, who flew in from London, had been given a choice of prosecution or leaving, and he opted to leave. His party denies that. "UTTER DESPERATION" Pakistan, an important US ally, faces weeks of uncertainty. Newspapers, which have enjoyed more freedom under Musharraf than they did under Sharif, condemned the government for ignoring the Supreme Court ruling saying Sharif could come back, and for deporting him. The English-language News said it was "an act of pure and utter desperation by a government that seems to be now operating very much in panic mode". "The country faces turbulent times in the next few days and weeks," it said. A pro-Sharif opposition bloc, the All Parties Democratic Alliance, has called for protests and lawyers, who have been at the forefront of a campaign against Musharraf's rule since March, boycotted the courts to protest Sharif's deportation. Another former prime minister in exile, Benazir Bhutto, is also expected to try to come home. But she is in talks with Musharraf on a power-sharing pact. Musharraf, under more pressure from the courts and public after deporting Sharif, might now be more willing to cut a deal with Bhutto to shore up his position. An aide to Bhutto said on Monday she would likely return in October to lead her party in general elections. The United States, which was mildly critical of Sharif's deportation, has urged Musharraf to find ways of cooperating with Bhutto. US Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte is due for scheduled talks this week.
