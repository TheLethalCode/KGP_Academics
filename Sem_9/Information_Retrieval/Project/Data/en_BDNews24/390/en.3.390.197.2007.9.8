 Dhaka, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com) - Left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak sustained a hamstring injury during the World Cup Twenty20 warm-up match against Scotland at Centurion in Pretoria Saturday. Razzak, who Saturday bowled only two overs to take two wickets for four runs, has been given four days rest following the injury. "The team management has informed me about the injury of Razzak, who has also been given four days rest," said the cricket operation chairman of Bangladesh Cricket Board Gazi Ashraf Hossain Lipu, adding that he was not aware of details. Bangladesh will start their inaugural Twenty20 campaign playing against West Indies on September 13. Earlier, Saqib Al Hasan suffered from a right-thumb injury during the four-nation Twenty20 tournament in Kenya that ruled him out from that tournament. However, Saqib recovered his thumb and played against Scotland Saturday. bdne
