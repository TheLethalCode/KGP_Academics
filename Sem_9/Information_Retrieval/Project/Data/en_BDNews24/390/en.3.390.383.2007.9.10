 Dhaka, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Monday jailed former BNP minister Mirza Abbas's younger brother Mirza Khokan for eight years in jail on charges of tax-dodge. Judge Shahed Noor Uddin of the Special Judge's Court-3 also fined him Tk 2.5 lakh and Khokan faces another six months in jail if he does not pay the penalty. He has been on the run since the caretaker government took over. The court handed down five years' jail term and a fine of Tk 2.5 lakh under the 1984 Income Tax Ordinance for concealing information about his wealth. Khokan received three years' imprisonment under the same ordinance for giving false information. However, with both punishments coming in force simultaneously the convict would have to spend five years behind bars, the court ruled. The sentence would take effect on the day the accused is arrested or surrenders. Assistant tax commissioner Rahima Khatun of the National Board of Revenue filed a case with the court of Dhaka senior special judge Md Azizul Haque on June 30. The NBR official alleged Khokan, as the director of Sava Enterprise, transacted Tk 3.83 crore in his own account with Rupali Bank Rajarbagh branch in fiscal 2005-06. The balance in the account on June 30, 2005 was Tk 12.96 lakh. He concealed the information in the income tax return and evaded tax worth about Tk 2.26 lakh. Tk 12.96 lakh has been forfeited. Charges were framed on August 23 after the case was transferred to the court housed in the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban complex for trial. Witnesses testified in the court from August 28 to 29 before the judge fixed the date for the verdict. The court in two separate cases had sentenced Mirza Abbas's wife Afroza Abbas to 16 years in for similar offences. A case against Mirza Abbas on charges of tax-dodge is also on trial at the same court. bdnews24
