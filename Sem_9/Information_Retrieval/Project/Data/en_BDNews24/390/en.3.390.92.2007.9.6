<TITLE> It's all but impossible to bypass donors now: Azizul </TITLE>

 Dhaka, Sep 6 (bdnews24.com) -- Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Thursday said it was nearly impossible to make policies, bypassing donors, importers, exporters and neighbours. But the adviser disagreed with the views of his predecessors that the economic policy was too donor-prescription-driven. The finance adviser's predecessors had earlier said that policies adopted through external pressure could not be sustainable. "In the era of globalisation, the so-called sovereignty of a country is automatically curtailed," Azizul told a seminar in reply to observations of former ministers and advisers on, what they termed, donors' excessive intervention in the country's policymaking. Former planning and finance ministers and advisers, who gathered to mark Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies' golden jubilee celebration, said that policies without political mandate could not be sustainable. Azizul chaired the seminar titled "Policymakers and policies: From the past into the future" at Spectra Convention Centre. Prof Rehman Sobhan, AMA Muhit, M Syeduzzaman, M Hafizuddin Khan and AK Khandaker spoke as panellists. "Changes are taking place in other countries and one has to look at these changes," Azizul said. He admitted that aid dependence on macro-economy has declined, but still the country depended on donors for about 40 percent of its development budget. "I see no way of covering the gap from internal resources," the adviser said. The panellists briefly evaluated the past policies of all governments and focused on future policies for upcoming governments. From donor-pushed policies to unplanned domestic ones, the discussants touched the policy matrix related to poverty, education, agriculture and rural farm and non-farm activities for future planning. They said that political parties and people should be involved in policymaking issues, not the development partners who they blamed for undue intervention. "Policies adopted from external pressure can't be sustainable," said Prof Rehman Sobhan, an economist and former adviser to the Shahbuddin Ahmed-led caretaker government. He asserted: "Political parties as well as people should be involved in all policymaking issues." "Political mandate for decision making policies is required," Syeduzzaman echoed Prof Sobhan. Prof Sobhan said Bangladesh's aid dependence hovers at around just 2 percent of the GDP. He said that the country did not need let its policies decay for that poor aid figure. "Once you acquire dependence on aid psychologically, you can't come out of the cycle," Prof Sobhan said, "We're sovereign to our people, not to donors." He asked the government to ensure people's ownership in the policies. Hafizuddin Khan said that he had been pressurised by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to formulate a public expenditure review committee and raise energy prices respectively when he was an adviser. Muhit asked the government to think twice before adopting donor-driven policies. He cited that donor contribution to the economy was currently less than 3 percent from 60-80 percent two decades ago. Stressing on the need for capacity building, Prof MA Taslim of Dhaka University said that the BIDS's capacity had declined over the years. "Donors push policies because we don't have the capacity." The finance adviser agreed with Prof Taslim and said, "Perhaps, capacity building within the government has declined in course of time." Azizul asked the BIDS officials to identify critical issues for self-research. Prof Nazrul Islam, chairman of the University Grants Commission asked the government to adopt policies in line with the decentralisation of urbanisation. BIDS, a research organisation, set up in 1957, organised the seminar to mark its golden jubilee. bd
