 Dhaka, Sept 9 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh finished seventh in the 7th Asia Cup Hockey with a 3-1 win over Hong Kong in the place-deciding match in Chennai Sunday. Bangladesh, whose hope to finish sixth in the 11-nation meet, was destroyed after suffering a 10-0 defeat to Pakistan Saturday, went one goal down with Ali Arif giving Hong Kong a 25-minute lead converting a penalty corner. Bangladesh, however, bounced just before the break with Rasel Mahmud Jimmy equalising the margin in the 35th minute through a field goal and Bangladesh did not look back. After the breather, Zahid BinTalib Shuvo gave Bangladesh a lead through a field goal in the 46th minute and Jimmy, who was later adjudged man of the match, sealed the match in the 59th minute converting a penalty corner. In the pool matches, Bangladesh lost to India, South Korea and China while they beat Thailand and Sri Lanka. The hockey team is scheduled to leave Chennai today by train and is expected to return home on September 11.
