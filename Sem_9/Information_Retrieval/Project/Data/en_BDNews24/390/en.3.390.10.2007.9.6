 LONDON, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares rallied on Thursday as short-term lending rates eased ahead of two key central bank meetings that are expected to yield no change in interest rates, while higher oil prices boosted energy majors. A sharp rally in Japanese stocks late in Tokyo added to the positive tone early in Europe. By 0802 GMT the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.7 percent at 1,533.55 points. The European Central Bank and the Bank of England release their decisions on monetary policy later, and analysts expect a squeeze in credit markets and high volatility to prompt both the ECB and BoE to hold fire. But equity investors will be eager to hear any words of reassurance from ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet on the bank's commitment to keep money markets liquid. "We'll all be on the sidelines and watching out what the ECB will eventually say, how will they argue, not what they will do," said Heino Ruland, a strategist at German brokerage Steubing in Frankfurt. bdnews24.com/lq/1500hrs "If (central banks) inject tons of liquidity into their money markets in order to keep interest rates low, then they can't be reducing the Federal funds rate, while positioning for at least a hike in the UK as well as Europe," he said, adding: "Money market conditions are very tight, and providing liquidity and raising interest rates doesn't fit." Commodity shares were the top gainers in Europe. Leading the charge higher was Rio Tinto, which rose over 3 percent on renewed speculation rival BHP Billiton might bid for it. Rio declined to comment. Consolidation talk and a rise in the copper price also helped miners, including Anglo American, which rose 2.1 percent, and BHP Billiton, which gained 1.8 percent. Shares in BP rose 0.5 percent, France's Total rose 0.7 percent and Royal Dutch Shell rose 0.9 percent in London as Brent crude futures rose 0.4 percent. London's FTSE 100 index rose 0.7 percent, while Frankfurt's DAX gained 0.6 percent, and Paris's CAC 40 rose 0.7 percent. The FTSEurofirst is up over 3 percent for the year, but is still down by more than 6 percent from its highs for 2007 in mid-July before the crisis in U.S. subprime lending triggered a rise in volatility and lending rates, forcing some U.S. mortgage lenders into bankruptcy and leading to losses at hedge funds and other financial institutions. Overnight euro deposit rates fell to 3.9 percent from 4.5 percent earlier in the day after the ECB said it would hold a quick money market tender, further reducing the bank's scope to raise benchmark rates above their current 4 percent. "Clearly, the ECB, like the BOE and the Fed, wants to make sure that at the very least the overnight rate remains close to the official rate," said Barclays Capital analysts in a note. "The central banks will probably be successful on that count, but it seems clear that for the moment, banks are on their own as far as term money is concerned," they said. Among decliners, Royal Bank of Scotland was the top-weighted decliner, after it said on Wednesday that speculation it might lower its bid for ABN AMRO was "very premature". ABN AMRO rose 1.2 percent, while Santander gained 1 percent. Shares in Drax Group, Britain's biggest coal-fired power station, fell 3.7 percent after the company reported a 14 percent fal
