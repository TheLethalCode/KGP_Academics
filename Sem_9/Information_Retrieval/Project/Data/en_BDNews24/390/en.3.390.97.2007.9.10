 Dhaka, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com)  The US and the UK Monday welcomed the lifting of the ban on indoor politics. "The US embassy welcomes the chief advisor's announcement that the ban on politics would be partially lifted. This is an excellent sign of progress on the goals outlined in the elections roadmap," the American mission in Dhaka said in a statement. "We commend the government for taking this positive step to allow political parties to contribute to the reform process. It is now vital that all groups work together to forge progress through unhindered, constructive dialogue," the statement said. The British High Commission in Dhaka "warmly welcomed" caretaker administration head Fakhruddin Ahmed's speech and termed the end of the ban on parlour politics "an important step". The UK also welcomed the chief adviser's announcement of the intention to hold next parliamentary elections earlier than December 2008.
