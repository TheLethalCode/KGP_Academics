 Dhaka, Sep 9 (bdnews24.com)  Key apparel trade bodies and an expert Sunday welcomed the interim government's decision to lift restrictions on parlour politics. They said the withdrawal would help the government to create a congenial environment for the upcoming elections by 2008. "I hope the decision will enable politicians and parties to carry out the much-needed reforms," Anwar-Ul-Alam Chowdhury, president of BGMEA, told bdnews24.com. "Certainly, we welcome the decision," Fazlul Hoque, president of BKMEA, said. Hoque hoped the decision would help the Election Commission to conduct the next election as per its roadmap. The emergency government had slapped the ban on indoor politics on March 7 and the law enforcers had locked offices of the political parties. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed in a televised address to the nation Sunday evening announced an end to long-standing ban on indoor politics from Monday. Qazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmad, president of Bangladesh Economic Association, said the decision is a timely one and will help restore democracy. "Now the Election Commission would be able to sit with the political parties on the reform agenda," Ahmad said. The Election Commission plans to start crucial dialogue with political parties from September 12 on electoral reform proposals. The dialogue will run through to November 29, according to initial plan of Chief Election Commissioner A T M Shamsul Huda. The CEC earlier had made clear that they would sit with the representatives of 15 political parties selected on the basis of three criteria. The criteria are Parties that secured at least one parliamentary seat in any general election since Bangladesh's independence, parties that got at least 2 percent of votes cast in any general election and parties that have offices in 32 district and sub-district headquarters and have minimum 1,000 members. bd
