 Dhaka, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com)  Arafat Rahman Coco's wife Syeda Sharmila Rahman Sithi visited her mother-in law Khaleda Zia in the special jail Friday afternoon. Sharmila arrived at the special jail premises at 4:45pm. Her car was stopped in front of the security barricade and she was taken to the special jail in an ambulance. Sharmila's grandmother Shahana Afzal, who had accompanied her, did not get permission to enter the special jail, and waited for her grand-daughter in their car in front of the security barricade. Khaleda's elder daughter-in-law Jobaida Rahman, Tarique Rahman's wife, visited the former prime minister Thursday afternoon. After her arrest Monday, Khaleda's two daughters-in-law have been allowed to visit her in phases.
