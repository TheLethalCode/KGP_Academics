 ISLAMABAD, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At London's Heathrow airport, supporters, like party guests, wore green rosettes and T-shirts printed with the face of exiled Pakistan politician Nawaz Sharif. The noisy group took photographs of each other and gave the thumbs up as they headed through the departures lounge. Hours later, they stood dejected on the blistering tarmac of Islamabad airport, wondering where the host of their abandoned celebrations had been taken.

A wall of grim-faced police officers grabbed Sharif, shoving him first towards the airport exit and then back out to the landing strip, as his friends and supporters bellowed their shock and outrage.
