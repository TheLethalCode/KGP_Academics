 Dhaka, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com)A reliable and constant communication system is a primary need for any growing enterprise, businessmen said at a road show on global connectivity Sunday. Singapore Telecommunications (SingTel) and its Bangladesh partner Advanced Data Networks System organised the ConnectPlus IP-VPN road show at Radisson hotel to demonstrate a new suite of services. SingTel unveiled highly-secured data connectivity solutions that link the country's business outfits with their counterparts worldwide. "The IP-VPN technology will boost the communication systems in Asia. It will enhance Bangladesh's business connectivity with Asia Pacific, Middle East, Europe and United States," said Jeremy Tann who heads the company's South Asia business unit. Its customers can transfer data and run various applications using the international private leased lines of BTTB's submarine cable. "SingTel maintains world class security and quality of such solutions," Tann said. It was not long ago the dedicated leased lines were the only viable option for businesses requiring secure data transmission among multiple business locations. But it was highly expensive and was associated with a lot of complexities. Putting an end to it, the use of the internet and IP (Internet Protocol) for business purposes has accelerated the data networking environment for corporate clients. VPN stands for Virtual Private Network. The technology permits organisations to secure data transmission with key stakeholders. It allows sharing a particular subset of data with all stakeholders, sharing all data with a particular subset of stakeholders and sharing a particular subset of data with a particular subset of stakeholders. The key feature is IP security, which means it ensures the privacy of data travelling over the public internet. Asif Mahmood, chairman of Advanced Data Networks System, also spoke at the programme. Representatives of the Foreign Investors' Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Bangladesh Association of Software and Information Services and BGMEA were also present. bdnews24
