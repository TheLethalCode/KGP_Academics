 Dhaka, Sep 10 (bdnews24.com)Police have not allowed BNP leaders and activists to enter the party headquarters in Naya Paltan Monday despite the lifting of the ban on indoor politics. Police have been posted at the main entrance to the party office from 7:30 Sunday evening. The gate of the office was locked, with four office assistants inside. Several home ministry officials said the police stopped party leaders and workers from entering amid fears that two rival factions of the BNP, one led by Khandaker Delwar and the other by Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, might engage in clashes for occupation of the party office. Earlier Monday, newly appointed BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain along with party colleagues RA Gani, Masud Ahmed Rumy, Sohrab Hossain and Akhteruzzaman were denied entry into the party headquarters. Rizvi Ahmed, BNP assistant office secretary, told bdnews24.com, "We have got no comment from the DMP commissioner about the denial of entry. We sought permission from senior police officers so that our secretary general could go to the party office with senior leaders, but we did not get it." Joint commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan Police Mili Biswas told bdnews24.com at about 7.30 Monday evening that some BNP leaders along with Rizvi Ahmed had met her Monday. "They (BNP leaders) asked me why they were refused entry to the party headquarters and why police were posted there. I told them that the commissioner was aware of the matter. I asked them to wait and meet the commissioner," she said. After waiting for a while in her office, they left and did not leave any written documents in this connection, Mili said. bdnews
