<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com)  A magistrate's court Thursday sent Arafat Rahman Coco, the detained younger son of former prime minister Khaleda Zia, to jail even though his seven-day remand was yet to end. Coco was taken to the court of metropolitan magistrate Mohammed Salahuddin at around 1:50pm. His lawyers appealed for his proper treatment as he was suffering from chest pain and heart disease. They said he needed to be admitted to the National Institute of Cardio-Vascular Diseases (NICVD) or LabAid Cardiac Hospital for proper treatment. The attorneys also sought his division in the jail on the grounds that his elder brother Tarique Rahman had been given division in jail following a High Court order. The case filed against Coco could only be filed against civil servants but he was not one of them, the court heard. The magistrate ordered Coco into Dhaka Central Jail and court officials to keep the bail prayer in court record. He also ordered authorities to take measures for Coco's proper treatment and steps as per jail code regarding his appeal for division. More than 50 lawyers including Advocate Sanaullah Miah, Khorshed Alam and Golam Mostafa took part in the hearing. Coco and Khaleda were detained in their Shaheed Mainul Road home in Dhaka Cantonment on Sept 3 and the same day a Dhaka court placed Coco on a seven-day remand. Investigation officer of the case Anti-corruption commission deputy director Zahurul Huda earlier told bdnews24.com that Coco was fine, amid rumours flying around in the city over past two days that he died in custody. "He is fine and safe," Huda, who is investigating charges of corruption against Khaleda and Coco, told bdnews24.com. "It's completely a rumour that he is sick." An official close to the government had earlier hinted to bdnews24.com that Coco might be sent to jail Thursday although his seven-day remand was still running. "Coco might appear before the court anytime if necessary," the policymaker said on condition of anonymity. The ACC Sunday filed a corruption case against Khaleda and Coco and 13 others. According to case details, Khaleda awarded contracts to a private firm to operate two government container terminals, one in Kamlapur Railway Station and another in Chittagong Seaport, when she was in office in 2003. Coco allegedly influenced her mother to award the contracts. bdnews24.com/ehb/ah
