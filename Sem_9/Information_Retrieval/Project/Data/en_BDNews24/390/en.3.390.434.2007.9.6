 Dhaka, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com) -- Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed assured Thursday that the supply of market essentials would remain free of the annual price hikes experienced during Ramadan. After a meeting with a visiting team from the International Monetary Fund, Salehuddin told reporters: "The supply of essentials such as rice and wheat has substantially increased. "Some other commodities will be imported soon and will arrive before the start of the holy month. "Given these provisions there should be no problem with the supply of commodities in the markets' over Ramadan." He added: "To keep inflation at a bearable level local output will have to increase alongside imported goods." "Without increasing agricultural output it will be very difficult to contain inflation." The central bank's governor also said the IMF team had been satisfied with their brief on the macro-economic health of the nation. When questioned on any IMF reaction to the central bank's monetary policy, Salehuddin said: "They did not make any comment on that." "We will follow monetary policies in line with our needs. It is not a big issue what the IMF or others say," he added. The IMF's Asia Pacific Department adviser Thomas Rumbaugh led the delegation to the talks held at the central bank's headquarters. bdnews24.
