 Dhaka, Sep 10 (bdnews24.com) -- Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Monday said more government-owned companies would offload shares soon to make the capital market vibrant. "The government is working on a plan to offload the shares of state-owned enterprises, including some oil companies, banks, Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board, Titas Gas and Jamuna Multi-purpose Bridge to enhance the supply of securities to the market," Azizul said at a ceremony to mark the inauguration of Dhaka Stock Exchange Training Academy. But the adviser slammed the private sector, mostly family-owned, for not coming to the market to raise their capital base. "They (family) lack the vision for expansion," Azizul said. "Look at Indian companies, such as Tata and Reliance that have adopted the trend of global expansion." "If they (family businesses) had a vision, they would have understood that the most cost-effective way to raise capital is to come to the capital market," said Azizul, former chief of the Securities and Exchange Commission. SEC chairman Faruq Ahmad Siddiqi spoke as special guest at the ceremony, chaired by DSE president Abdullah Bokhari. The finance adviser said, "Corporatisation of BTTB was underway and a memorandum of articles is awaiting the chief adviser's approval." "Offloading of BTTB's shares would take a little time as valuation of its assets is time-consuming," Azizul said. On Jamuna Bridge, he said: "I hope there would some progresses this year." Recalling the days of 1996 and the consequences in the capital market, Azizul said the capital market has now developed to some extent. But he said it requires combined efforts to promote growth. He said the government realised less taxes from listed companies than unlisted ones to encourage more to come to the market. "Road shows need to be arranged for issuers, not for investors," he suggested saying that investors are already motivated. bd
