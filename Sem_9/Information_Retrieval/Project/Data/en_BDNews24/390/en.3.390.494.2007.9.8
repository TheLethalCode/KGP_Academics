<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com) - Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Saturday said the government would not enter into any deal with the International Monetary Fund compromising the country's interest. However, the IMF, he said, wanted an agreement of any kind to provide budgetary assistance for Bangladesh. "At the moment, assistance of donor agencies including the IMF and the World Bank was necessary for rehabilitation to make up for floods losses," the adviser told reporters after a meeting with a visiting IMF delegation at the Planning Commission. "But I want to assure you that the government won't take any assistance from the IMF or any other donor agency through any agreement that compromises the interest of the country," he emphasised. IMF Asia-Pacific region adviser Thomas Rumbaugh led the five-member IMF team. Rumbaugh said the IMF was continuing discussions and wanted to sign an agreement with the government in the light of budgetary assistance. There are several ways for Bangladesh to receive the IMF assistance, he said. Media reports over the past several days had it that the government was going to sign the Policy Support Instrument (PSI) with the IMF. Economists, business leaders and civil-society representatives had said that national interests would be compromised if Bangladesh signed the PSI. Azizul said: "There was no discussion on PSI during the meeting with the IMF. They want to assist Bangladesh under the Poverty Reduction Growth Fund or any such agreement." "However, much misunderstanding has been created over the matter. It is not right that the IMF is going to impose PSI on us. "The main thing is at the moment we need assistance. Be it under the PRGF or the PSI. However, I can assure you that the government will sign no agreement with the IMF which goes against the country's interest." The adviser said, "The IMF has given several conditions for budgetary assistance. I agree on almost all of them. They have suggested separation of the National Board of Revenue and Internal Resources Division." "I personally agree on this proposal. Besides they have told us to reform the income tax laws and revenue administration, take effective steps for keeping inflation at a tolerable level, carry out finance sector reform and expand VAT base. We are also considering the matters." "The prices of essentials increased in the local market as the prices went up in international market. However, I have found through a personal research that prices have not increased in local market at the level they have increased in the international market." "There is deficiency in revenue collections. The government's expenditure has increased due to floods. In such situation, the IMF' budgetary assistance is very much necessary," Azizul said. bdnews24.
