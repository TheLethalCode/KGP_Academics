 Dhaka, Sep 9 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed in a televised address to the nation Sunday announced an end to a six-month long ban on indoor politics from Monday. He also said no more cases would be filed and nobody would further be harassed in connection with the incidents at Dhaka University and other public universities across the country late August. Fakhruddin further assured the nation the national taskforce on corruption would publish no new lists of corruption suspects after the end of the current month. However, the other government agencies would continue their anti-corruption activities in line with law and rules. In his 25-minute speech simultaneously broadcast live by the state-run Bangladesh Television and Bangladesh Betar, and the private TV stations, Fakhruddin said: "Eight months have passed since this caretaker government took office amid an unexpected turmoil." "Since then the government has been working to arrange a free, fair and neutral election. To reach that goal some fundamental institutional and infrastructural reforms were required." The chief adviser admitted that there might have been some mistakes his government made as there are mistakes made by any government. But Fakhruddin stressed his administration has been taking some tough measures only to build a good social infrastructure. "The government has taken some short-term stern and corrective steps keeping in mind the unchangeable condition that the present government has come to power for a limited time." "Our efforts will go on to build solid foundations for democracy and good governance and create a context free from corruption and muscle power to make sure that our path to a progressive and democratic society is not hampered," he added. Fakhruddin repeated his pledge to transfer power to elected public representatives after arranging the elections by the 2008 deadline. The chief adviser reminded the public that the Election Commission has taken steps to prepare a flawless voter list and prepared the draft of the amendment to the election laws and rules, which will be finalised in a series of discussions with the political parties beginning September 12. "I would like to assure you that we are determined to do the work we are meant to do." He said to create the proper environment for the electoral reform discussions the government was lifting the ban on parlour politics from Monday. The Election Commission, on its part, has long been asking the government to lift the ban to enable it to hold its proposed dialogues with political parties. Chief Election Commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda earlier in the day had said the EC would ask the chief adviser on September 11 to allow indoor politics if the government had not done so by then. Fakhruddin said the government was also determined to reflect the anti-corruption stance of the public. He said the government had recovered Tk 820 crore siphoned off through corruption and other irregularities. Speaking of the events in late August, the chief adviser said an unwanted situation arose over a sad incident at Dhaka University. "The government accepted the demands of the students in the shortest time." But an unruly quarter indulged in violent and destructive activities in Dhaka and other parts of the country, and the public and businesses suffered huge losses, said Fakhruddin. As a result, said the chief adviser, the government was compelled to impose curfew on divisional cities and close public universities and some colleges. As the situation returned to normal the government quickly withdrew the curfew and announced the opening of the universities and colleges. He assured the nation that no more cases would be filed in connection with the events of late August. However, earlier in the day, Dhaka Metropolitan Police submitted charge sheets against 36 persons including Dhaka University teachers Prof Anwar Hossain and Prof Harun-or Rashid in 13 out of 53 cases filed in connection with the student protests on August 21-22. The chief adviser said the government would try to maintain uninterrupted power supply to the shops and shopping malls during Ramadan and would also strengthen security during the month. He said the government was trying its best to contain price spiral of essentials. BDR's dal-bhat programme has been strengthened to keep the prices lower in the retail market. The interim government head saidAnother 200 megawatt power would be generated by December this year, 370 MW more by June next. He said Tk 2,100 crore has been channeled from budgetary allocation to repair the physical infrastructure damaged by flooding. The armed forces are sincere about providing assistance to establish true democracy through free, fair and credible elections, he reminded the nation. bdnews24.co
