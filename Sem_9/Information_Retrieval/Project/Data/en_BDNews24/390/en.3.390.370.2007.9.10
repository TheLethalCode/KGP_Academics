 LONDON, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's former prime minister Benazir Bhutto aims to return from exile in October to contest national elections, a spokesman said on Monday. "Mrs Bhutto has decided to travel to Pakistan," Bhutto's spokesman Wajid Hassan told Reuters Television in an interview. "She has planned it next month, probably. She will announce it on Sept. 14 as to the date of her arrival in Pakistan."

Bhutto wants Musharraf to step down as army chief, immunity from prosecution for herself and others who ruled in the late 1980s and 1990s and the lifting of a ban on a prime minister serving a third term. She also wants presidents stripped of the power to dissolve the National Assembly and dismiss governments. In return, her party would bolster Musharraf's support base and help clear the way for him to run for re-election after he quits as army chief by backing a constitutional change waiving a bar on state servants running for office. Bhutto has already been prime minister of Pakistan twice. On both occasions she was dismissed from office by the president for suspected corrupti
