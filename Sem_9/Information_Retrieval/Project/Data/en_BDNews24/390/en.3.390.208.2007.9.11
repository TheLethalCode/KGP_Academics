<TEXT>
 MELBOURNE, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A second-half header from Martin Demichelis gave Argentina a 1-0 victory in an entertaining friendly against Australia on Tuesday. After both sides had clattered the woodwork at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the Bayern Munich defender got the faintest of glances on the inspirational Lionel Messi's inswinging freekick on 49 minutes to claim the spoils. Messi had struck the post for the South Americans in the first half and was a constant danger to the home defence. "He was fabulous," Argentina coach Alfio Basile told reporters. "He brings a lot of fantasy into the game like Ronaldinho. "He is always doing the unexpected and it is something that is unique. He's obviously an immense talent." With Basile fielding a strong starting line-up and Australia without most of their Premier League contingent, it was the hosts who surprised with the best early chance. Mark Bresciano's angled drive beat goalkeeper Roberto Abbondanzieri on seven minutes but was stopped on the line by Demichelis. MIRACULOUS ESCAPE Carlos Tevez just failed to get a toe on a cross from Jonas Gutierrez, before the Manchester United forward provided Gabriel Heinze with a chance at the far post only for the left-back to balloon the ball into the stands. Messi capped a fine spell of Argentine pressure by cutting inside his man and smacking the inside of the post with a low left-foot effort from 25 metres. The South Americans enjoyed a miraculous escape on 25 minutes when Bresciano's 30-metre free-kick was palmed on to the bar by Abbondanzieri. The ball rebounded off the keeper's body on to the woodwork again before a second rebound off the stopper. Argentina's flair continued to master Australia's industry after the break and it was inevitably Messi who carved out the breakthrough. His free-kick found Demichelis in a big space in the Australia box and a glancing header sent the ball past Mark Schwarzer into the far corner. The Socceroos responded with David Carney's mishit cross forcing Abbondanzieri to scamper back to turn away for the corner, before the keeper was again called into action to palm over Bresciano's free-kick. The match was Australia's first since they went out of the Asian Cup at the quarter-final stage in July, while Argentina were using the contest as preparation for the South American World Cup qualifiers, which get underway next month
