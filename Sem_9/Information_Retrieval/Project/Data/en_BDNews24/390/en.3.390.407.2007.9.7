 Dhaka, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com)  Expelled BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan Friday renewed the claim that his faction represented the mainstream BNP. "It is us who do politics of mainstream BNP. We uphold the ideals of [Ziaur Rahman]. Inshaallah, BNP will win the election next time with the support of the people," he said to reporters at his Gulshan home. "We represent the BNP which is following the ideals of Zia. This is the mainstream BNP. We have taken initiative to make this party more dynamic through reform. "When the reform programme will be implemented the BNP will be more acceptable and popular to the people," Bhuiyan said before saying his Friday prayers. He urged party leaders and workers to remain united. "BNP will have to be taken forward with the ideals of Zia. We will surely win the next election with people's mandate after making time-befitting reform." BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia prior to her arrest on Sep 3 expelled Bhuiyan and joint secretary general Ashraf Hossain and appointed standing committee member Khandaker Delwar Hossain as secretary general. However, most of the senior leaders and former lawmakers of the party snubbed her decision and sided with the renegades. Several hundred workers including more than 100 former lawmakers and central leaders attended an emergency meeting at Bhuiyan's Gulshan home Wednesday to throw their weight behind him. Bhuiyan and Ashraf in their immediate reaction had said Khaleda's action was in breach of BNP constitution, and undemocratic and unacceptable. Delwar, the new secretary general, said, "Mannan Bhuiyan and Ashraf Hossain no more belong to BNP. They have been expelled in line with party constitution." bdnew
