<TEXT>
 LONDON, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British music and books retailer HMV Group Plc said the latest Harry Potter blockbuster and a boost to DVD sales from wet summer weather had led to strong trading and leaves the business in good shape ahead of the key Christmas trading period. The company, which runs Waterstone's bookstores as well as music shops under its own name, said like-for-like group sales were up 5.8 percent in the 18 weeks to Sept. 1, which compares with sales growth of 3.8 percent in the first eight weeks. "The group has made a pleasing start to the current financial year, with good momentum in sales, margins and cost management," Chairman Carl Symon said in a trading update ahead of the company's annual shareholders' meeting on Thursday. "At this point in our trading calendar we have much work to do, but we expect to approach the key Christmas period in good operational shape," he added. Shares in HMV gave up early gains to stand unchanged at 130 pence by 0835 GMT, valuing the company at 543.8 million pounds ($1.09 billion). The stock had outperformed the UK general retailers' sector by 3 percent so far this year. "We believe HMV is still a business in structural decline and in our view the new initiatives are not sufficient to offset the forces of declining markets in both music and DVDs, strong price deflation and increased competition from both online retailers and supermarkets," Numis said in a note. Numis kept its 80p price target on the stock. Meanwhile Kaupthing Singer & Friedlander called it a "solid statement" while sticking to its forecast for pretax profit in the year to April 2008 of 50.5 million pounds. According to Reuters Estimates, analysts expect HMV's underlying pretax profit will rise to 49.7 million pounds, on average, with forecasts ranging from 34.7 million to 77 million. In June, HMV said underlying pretax profit had more than halved to 48.1 million pounds for the year ended April 28, as it battled cut-price supermarket and online sales. "The DVD market has remained unexpectedly buoyant over a rainy summer period with volume growth of 20 percent for the 18 weeks," Chief Executive Simon Fox told a conference call. Like-for-like sales at HMV UK grew by 9.6 percent in the 18-week period, which compared with growth of 8.8 percent in the first eight weeks, helped by the stronger than expected DVD sales. Like-for-like sales at Waterstone's rose by 2.7 percent in the period, reflecting very strong sales of the seventh and final volume of the Harry Potter series of books. Adjusting for the impact of Harry Potter, like-for-like sales were flat. Fox told reporters the company sold more than half a million copies of "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows", up 200 percent on the same period for the sixth book in the series. "The better than expected HMV performance is likely to more than offset the weaker than expected gains at Waterstone's, leading to an upgrade to our estimates," Landsbanki analyst David Stoddart said in a note. "This still leaves the shares looking fairly valued in the short term, with longer-term concerns about high street-based entertainment retailing still in place," he added. HMV has faced mounting competition from supermarket groups such as Tesco Plc and Wal-Mart Stores Inc's Asda, as well as online retailers selling CDs and DVDs. HMV sold its Japanese business in July but Fox said there were no plans to sell any other parts of the group. "There are no other parts of the business under review," he told reporte
