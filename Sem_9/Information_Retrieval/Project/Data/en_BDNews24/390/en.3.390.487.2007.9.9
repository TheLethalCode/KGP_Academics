 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com Staff Correspondent Dhaka, Sept 9 (bdnews24.com)  Agriculture experts warn that fresh flooding in seven to eight districts of the country will severely impact the nations agricultural output. The Directorate of Agriculture Extension said the Aman rice harvest may be drastically reduced this year. The directorate also said newly sown crops would be destroyed if they remained under water more than 24 hours. A special agriculture programme is operating in 39 flood-hit districts at a cost of Tk 30 crore. The programme supplies farmers with seedlings of six different crops and free fertiliser. Aman seedlings worth Tk 1.55 crore have so far been distributed. The second phase will require Tk 52 crore, according to directorate estimates. DAE officials said if rain continues at current levels for just two or three more days the Rabi rice crop could also be severely damaged. They added that livestock may also be affected by bovine 'foot and mouth disease'. Dr Zahurul Karim, former chairman of Bangladesh Agriculture Research Council, told bdnews24.com: "Sowing Aman seedling is not possible after Sept 10." "Generally if Aman is sown after Sept 5 production decreases by 30 percent. It might be totally destroyed in areas that have been flooded for a second time. The farmers will not see any return on their investment," he said. According to government data, crops on 779,151 acres have been destroyed in the current flooding. Fish worth Tk 200 crore have also been washed away by the rising flood waters. bdnews24.
