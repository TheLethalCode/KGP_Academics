 BUCHAREST, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Four people were killed and several were missing after torrential rains flooded areas of eastern Romania on Wednesday and Thursday, officials said on Thursday. "Hundreds of households were flooded in several villages in the counties of Vrancea, Bacau and Vaslui," an Interior Ministry press officer told Reuters. The ministry said in a statement authorities would distribute food and water in the flooded areas. "Losses are bigger than we could imagine," Prime Minister Calin Tariceanu said on television after visiting the area. Worst affected is the town of Tecuci, where 150 people were rescued by firefighters from their flooded homes. Rain had eased on Thursday and meteorologists said the weather was likely to improve further before the weekend.
