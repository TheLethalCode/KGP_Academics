 Dhaka, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh's Indian football coach Syed Nayeemuddin has emphasised booters' fitness in a month-long residential camp at Cox's Bazar. Nayeemuddin, who returned to Dhaka Saturday from Kalkata, is scheduled to leave here for Cox's Bazar tonight to join the booters. "There is no alternative to increasing players' fitness to compete at the international level and I first want to strengthen players' fitness, fitness and fitness," Nayeemuddin repeated the word to bdnews24.com Saturday at the Brothers Union tent in Gopibagh. Nayeemuddin believes the camp in Cox's Bazar would help the players a lot in terms of strengthening players' calf and muscle for their playing in the sandy pitch and the fresh air in this tourism resort would boost their physical strength considerably. He said that he would deck up the daily schedules after observing the condition of the playground and weather in Cox's Bazar. The veteran coach was satisfied with the team's performance in Nehru Cup, where Bangladesh lost three matches against India, Syria, and Kyrgyzstan and drew with Cambodia. "It is not possible to bring result in a day, but I am happy in the way the players fought. They tried hundred percent though they got a little time to get fresh by playing four matches in six days," said Nayeemuddin. Asked whether he committed any mistake with fielding players in different positions instead of their real positions, he said, "Football is a very easy game : receive the ball and pass it, and if a player can play as a right stopper, then why doesn't he play as a left stopper as the task is same?" Nayeemuddin said, "Only experience makes the difference between Bangladesh and Indian football teams. Indians are playing a lot of football throughout the year. They have built up a strong pipeline through holding different age-level tournaments ,thus creating quality booters at the national fold." The Indian coach, however, kept mum about the exclusion of veteran striker Alfaz Ahmed, who returned to the national fold breaking his retirement and played for the nation in last month's Nehru Cup in India. During the announcement of a 33-member squad, assistant coach Hasanuzzaman Bablu said that they dropped Alfaz in line with Nayeemuddin's suggestion. "I let you know later about this," said Nayeemuddin adding he had just been informed of the preliminary squad. Our Cox's Bazar correspondent said that the footballers arrived at the town on Saturday morning and assed sometime on the sandy beach. Of 33 players, three footballers -- Motiur Munna, Firoz Mahmud Titu and Mehdi Hasan Ujjal -- did not turn up at the camp citing family problems, said co-coordinator Amirul Islam Babu.
