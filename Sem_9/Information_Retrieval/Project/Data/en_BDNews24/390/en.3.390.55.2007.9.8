<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Party's acting chairman Anisul Islam Mahmud has said Roushan Ershad does not have the right to expel leaders from the party. "She's just a presidium member," Anisul Islam told bdnews24.com Saturday, a day after breakaway JP faction chief Roushan expelled him and presidium member Ziauddin Ahmed Bablu. "It's not clear on which basis of the party constitution she is claiming to be the chairman. According to the party constitution, the presidium member cannot expel anybody." Anisul Islam, who took over as acting chairman, nominated by HM Ershad two and a half months ago, said: "Punitive measures will be taken if anyone breaches party discipline. It doesn't matter who they are and what positions they hold." Acting secretary general Golam Mosih of the Roushan-led faction told bdnews24.com: "Anisul Islam Mahmud and Ziauddin Ahmed Bablu are nobody. Barrister Anis became acting chairman of the party illegally. "Roushan Ershad is next to party chairman HM Ershad. She is the leader of the party in his absence. The explanation by Anisul Islam is not right." Roushan called an emergency meeting as "party chairman" at her Gulshan home Friday and decided to expel Anisul Islam and Ziauddin Ahmed. The expulsions came a day after Anisul Islam removed eight top JP leaders including, Roushan-led faction's secretary general Golam Mosih. Some of the leaders had already joined Ferdous Ahmed Quarishi's new party, Progressive Democratic Party. Ershad's decision to elevate Anisul Islam to acting chairman irked Roushan who was quick to break away from her husband's party and float a faction. bdnews24.com/s
