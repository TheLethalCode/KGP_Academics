 KARACHI, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan have recalled fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar from the Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa after a bust up with team mate Mohammad Asif. The incident took place on Thursday in the team's nets. A team source said a heated arguement between the two led to Shoaib striking Asif on the thigh with a bat. "A decision has been taken to call back Shoaib on the basis of an initial inquiry by the touring team management in South Africa," Shafqat Nagmi, chief executive of the Pakistan Cricket Board, told Reuters on Friday. Naghmi said a detailed inquiry into the "unfortunate incident" would be held when the player returned to Pakistan. "Shoaib has also admitted to hitting Asif. Thankfully Asif didn't suffer any major injury but a bruise on his left thigh and he will be okay," he added. No decision had been taken on sending a replacement to South Africa, which is allowed under tournament rules, although a PCB source said pacer Mohammad Sami was being lined up. Naghmi said the board was clear on its disciplinary policy and that no player was bigger than the game. "No one will be spared if he flouts the rules and team spirit. What has happened is something that has shocked us." Former test captain Aamir Sohail said the board had taken the correct decision because players had to be shown they cannot cross the line. "Senior players have a responsibility in the team and what Shoaib did was sad. The incident needs to be investigated thoroughly." Shoaib has a history of run-ins with players and officials and has been reprimanded on several occasions for his conduct. He has taken 169 test and 208 one-day wickets
