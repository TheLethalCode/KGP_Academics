<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com)  Leaders and activists of the Awami League and BNP rushed to party offices Monday, a day after chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed lifted a ban on indoor politics. Supporters of BNP's new secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, nominated by chairperson Khaleda Zia, showed up in front of the BNP central office at 8:30am. But they were not allowed in. Security officers reasoned out a lack of necessary 'permission'. Police barred them from entering the office, BNP spokesman Rizvi Ahmed said. On the other hand, leaders and activists of AL and its front organisations gathered in front of the party office on Bangabandhu Avenue Monday morning. They entered the office without any obstacle. But no central leader came to the office until 11:30am. bdnews24.com/sm/sum/
