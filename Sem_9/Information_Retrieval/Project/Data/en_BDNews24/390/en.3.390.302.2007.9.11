 Dhaka, Sep 11 (bdnews24.com) A Dhaka court Tuesday ordered first-class division for Dhaka University teachers Anwar Hossain and Harun-or-Rashid in jail. Metropolitan magistrate Md Sarowar Hasan ordered the prison authorities to take steps in this regard in line with the Jail Code. Meanwhile, police took two DU students, Din Islam Angel, a second-year student of Mass Communications and Journalism, and Shafiqul Islam Sujon, student of Islamic History and Culture, on five-day remand for questioning. They are accused of being involved in clashes and rampages during the student unrest at Dhaka University late August.

Earlier on Tuesday, another metropolitan magistrate, ABM Abdul Fattah, took confessional statements from the students.
