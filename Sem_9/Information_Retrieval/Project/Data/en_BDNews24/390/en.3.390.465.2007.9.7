 Dhaka, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com)  Arafat Rahman Coco was admitted to Bangabandh Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital Friday afternoon with chest pain, less than 24 hours after he was taken to the Dhaka Central Jail. The younger son of detained former prime minister Khaleda Zia has been kept under the supervision of the doctors at Coronary Care Unit (CCU) of the hospital. "Coco has been brought to the hospital for better treatment. Cardiac specialist Dr Manzur Mahmud saw Coco at the central jail at 1:30pm and he was shifted to the hospital at 4:20pm," deputy inspector general (DIG), prisons, Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told bdnews24.com "Coco is feeling pain in the chest," he said. Thursday night, inspector general (IG), prisons Brigadier General Zakir Hasan told bdnews24.com, "Coco is very sick. He is being given treatment inside the jail." A metropolitan magistrate's court sent Coco to jail Thursday afternoon before the end of his seven-day remand. He looked pale in the court. His lawyers had told the court that Coco was suffering from chest pain and cardiac disease. They appealed for his admission in the National Institute of Cardio-Vascular Diseases (NICVD) or LabAid Cardiac Hospital. The court ordered jail authorities to take necessary steps for his treatment. The Anticorruption Commission (ACC) Sunday night filed a case with Tejgaon Police Station against 13 persons including Khaleda and Coco, who were arrested Monday morning. bdnews
