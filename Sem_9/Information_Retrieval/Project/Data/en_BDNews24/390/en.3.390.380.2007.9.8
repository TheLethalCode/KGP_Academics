 Dhaka, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com) Dhaka University reopens on Oct 28, according to a DU syndicate decision Saturday. Dhaka University treasurer Syed Abul Kalam Azad said a syndicate meeting also decided to reopen all residential halls of the university on Oct 23. The university will reopen after a long closure that includes Puja and Eid vacations. The syndicate finalised the decisions Saturday following recommendations of the deans' committee. Vice chancellor Prof SMA Faiz presided over the syndicate meeting. The meeting of the admissions committee on admission tests for 2007-08 will be held on Sept 12. Besides, the authorities have decided to complete all admission related-activities during the vacation. Commerce faculty dean Prof Sirajul Islam said the university authorities would take preparation so that they could complete the admission process by December and start classes on Jan 1 next year. All hall offices and department offices would reopen Sunday. The hall authorities have been directed so that the students can take their necessary materials from the halls before Eid. Departments that have only viva tests due to be taken, have been directed to do so during the vacation. Decision was also taken to start the examinations of the evening courses of different departments, centres and institutes and the colleges affiliated with the university, from September 15. All universities and colleges at the divisional cities were closed following a government circular on August 22. A total of 419 examinations of different sessions under different faculties of Dhaka University have been suspended from Aug 21. Of them, 253 ongoing examinations of the arts faculty and social science faculty and 140 exams of the science, biological science and pharmacy faculty and about 20 examinations of the commerce faculty have been suspended. Besides, examinations in some departments were scheduled for August and September, but they were also suspended. As a result, students would suffer a nearly five- month session jam. Earlier in mid-Ramadan last year, the academic activities remained suspended for about six months. That means students are losing one academic year. About 15 days were required to set the routine for an exam. As a result, it would take beyond the year 2007 to start all the suspended examinations. bdnew
