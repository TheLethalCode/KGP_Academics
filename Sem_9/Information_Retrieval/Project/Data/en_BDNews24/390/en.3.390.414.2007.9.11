 BAGHDAD, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraq's government on Tuesday welcomed testimony by the American commander in Iraq, who recommended 30,000 troops withdraw by next summer. "The Iraqi government welcomes this report," said Iraq's national security adviser Mowaffaq al-Rubaie, reading a statement on the government's official reaction to the testimony by General David Petraeus to Congress in Washington on Monday. "We highly appreciate the sacrifices given by our friends in the coalition, which has paved the way to boost victory and security in Iraq." Petraeus recommended cutting American troops by about 30,000 by next July, ending the so-called surge of forces but not fundamentally changing strategy in the unpopular war. He suggested the force could fall to about 130,000 without hurting modest security improvements. That would return US troop strength to roughly the same level it was before an increase ordered by President George W. Bush early this year. bd
