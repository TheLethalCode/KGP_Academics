 NEW YORK, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Swiss virtuoso Roger Federer captured his fourth successive U.S. Open title with cold-blooded efficiency on Sunday, proving to young Serb Novak Djokovic that he is not yet ready for a changing of the guard. Though far from his fluent best, world number one Federer won his 12th career grand slam title, wearing down the third-ranked Serb 7-6 7-6 6-4 in two hours, 26 minutes. Djokovic had five set points in the opening set and two more in the second but failed to convert any against the player who has held the world's top ranking for 188 weeks. "He had his chances today, many of them," Federer said. "You could sing a song about it. It's a tough one for him to swallow, especially with him losing in the end straight sets." The 20-year-old Djokovic was bidding to become the second youngest champion in U.S. Open history, behind Pete Sampras who captured his first title at the age of 19. "He's been there," lamented Djokovic, whose Arthur Ashe Stadium box included 2006 U.S. Open champion Maria Sharapova and actor Robert De Niro. "He has this experience. He knows what it feels like to be in that kind of situation. He knows how to cope with the pressure. "For me, this is something new. I have to look positive. Next time I hope I'm going to hold that trophy." Federer survived five set points at 5-6 in the opening set, a Djokovic double-fault forcing a tiebreak in which the Swiss was down a mini-break before clinching it 7-4. "I was quite nervous, a lot of pressure, and I knew that I had to make some shots," Djokovic said. "Obviously, that was mistake because I just needed to calm down and wait for my chances. Which I didn't." TIEBREAK MUTTERING Like a shark looking for weakness in its prey, Federer found it. Djokovic spent much of the tiebreak muttering to himself, tossing his racket and searching for answers. In the second set, with Federer serving at 5-6 and 15-40, Djokovic squandered two additional set points when the Swiss turned up his game to force another tiebreak, which he breezed through 7-2. In the third set, Federer broke Djokovic in the 10th game to claim his 27th successive win at Flushing Meadows and become the first man to win four straight Wimbledon and U.S. Opens. The 26-year-old five-times reigning Wimbledon champion is two grand slam wins shy of the all-time record set by American Pete Sampras. Federer used to claim he did not think about the record but has now changed his tune. "I think about it a lot now, honestly," he said. "In the beginning I felt pushed a little bit in the corner because you don't win slams like that. It's just too tough. "So to come so close already at my age is fantastic, and I really hope to break it." Federer played like a champion on Sunday, winning despite committing 34 unforced errors after averaging only 14.8 during the tournament. The black-clad Swiss converted three of five break-point opportunities while Djokovic was successful on just two of nine. Djokovic, who delighted the National Tennis Crowd last week with hilarious impressions of Sharapova and world number two Rafael Nadal, left Flushing Meadows ruing missed opportunities. "My next book is going to be called; 'Seven Set Points'," he joked
