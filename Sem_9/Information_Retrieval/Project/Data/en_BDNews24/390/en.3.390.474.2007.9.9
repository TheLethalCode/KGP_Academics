 MIRANSHAH, Pakistan, Sept 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani security forces killed 10 pro-Taliban militants on Sunday after they tried to attack a military convoy near the Afghan border, an army spokesman said. The clash took place in the Shawal area, 70 km (45 miles) southwest of Miranshah, the main town in the North Waziristan region, a hotbed of support for al Qaeda and the Taliban.

Pakistani forces have tried to clear out the foreign militants and subdue their Pakistani allies and the region has been plagued by intermittent violence since then. But violence has surged since July when a 10-month peace pact with militants in North Waziristan broke down and commandos stormed a radical mosque in Islamabad where militants linked to Waziristan were based. While most of the violence has been in the northwest, suicide bombers have killed more than 50 people in the capital Islamabad and the nearby city of Rawalpindi, home to army headquarters. In South Waziristan, tribal elders are trying to secure the release of 240 soldiers captured by militants late last month. The militants, who are demanding the withdrawal of troops from the region, released six of the captured soldiers last week.
