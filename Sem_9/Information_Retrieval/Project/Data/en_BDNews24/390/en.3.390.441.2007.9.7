 STUTTGART, Germany, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China outclassed their rivals easily to retain their men's team title at the world gymnastics championships on Thursday. Earning top scores on four of the six apparatus, next year's Olympic hosts underlined their dominance with a total of 281.900, a convincing 4.875 points ahead of silver medallists Japan. Hosts Germany gave the home crowd plenty to cheer about, including Fabian Hambuechen's breathtaking horizontal bar routine, to capture the bronze. Last year's silver medallists Russia were seventh in the eight-team final, further misery for the former powerhouse after their women's team finished last in their final on Wednesday. The United States finished fourth in a final that many critics had thought they would not even qualify for and proved that last year's abysmal 13th place had been a blip. For China, the gold was just a piece in the jigsaw that they hope to complete with a big medal haul at the 2008 Games on home soil. "I think the competition has been great for us and we know the mistakes we have to correct (before next year)," coach Bai Yuanshao told a news conference. CHINA SHINE In the same rotation group as Japan, China outshone their fellow Asians on the pommel horse after a solid but unspectacular start on the floor exercise. Xiao Qin spun his legs fast and high in a stylish routine that earned 16.225 and suggested he was on course to hold on to his pommel horse title in the weekend's apparatus finals. Last year's rings champion Chen Yibing showed he too was at his best, effortlessly switching from controlled handstands to dynamic swings on the rings to pick up 16.450, half a point more than anyone else managed. The holders surged further ahead after the vault where defending all-round champion Yang Wei's explosive twisting effort notched 16.525, the day's highest score on that apparatus. The gulf between Japan and the winners was evident on the rings where the silver medallists repeatedly seemed unable to hold their handstands although they said they still planned to give China a run for their money at the Olympics. "We did our best and are optimistic (about Beijing)," all-round hopeful Hiroyuki Tomita said. "Of course we expected to become world champions but we had problems on some apparatus but as soon as we are home we will work on it." Russia had been relieved to reach the final after a dreadful qualifying session where they had to compete with two hobbling gymnasts. Lacklustre displays on the floor, pommel horse and vault left them below less established teams such as fifth-placed South Korea and sixth-placed Spain. Romania finished last
