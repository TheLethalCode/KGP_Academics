<TITLE> Inflation unlikely to rise further: BB governor </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed Tuesday said inflation was unlikely to increase any further. The June inflation rate of 9.2 percent soared to 10.2 percent in July, pushing commodity prices to a new high, alarming consumers. The central bank governor has an explanation. The rate of opening L/Cs by businessmen for imports of commodities including grains fell in July, so did the supply of commodities to the market, Salehuddin said. The prices of merchandise, as a result, rose further, prompting Bangladesh Bank to adopt a number of measures to enhance the imports of consumer goods. After the first spell of floods, all banks started disbursing farm loans, which also contributed to promoting imports, he said. The governor expected that the country would see the inflation rate ease in the August-September period. The governor made the observation to reporters during the Prime Bank- sponsored education stipend awards distribution for meritorious students at Bangladesh China Friendship Conference Centre. The stipend awarding ceremony was also attended by Prime Bank chairman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury, who gave away stipends among 170 students. bdnews24.c
