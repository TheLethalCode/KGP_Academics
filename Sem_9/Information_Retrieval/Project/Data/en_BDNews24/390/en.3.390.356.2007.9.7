 GOMA, Congo, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Eight people were killed when a cargo plane overshot the runway and caught fire while landing in the eastern Congolese town of Goma on Friday, the latest in a spate of crashes in the central African state. The Russian-made Antonov plane, carrying a cargo of palm oil, burst into flames when it slammed into a petrified lava flow beyond the runway, expelled from nearby Mount Nyiragongo when it erupted in 2002, witnesses said. The two crew and six passengers, including three children, were killed, police said. "The tyres exploded on one side and then blew on the other side as well, and the plane slid into the lava at the end of the runway," one witness told a Reuters reporter in Goma. The plane, operated by local Galaxy Kavatsi airlines, was making a stopover on a flight from the capital Kinshasa to the town of Bukavu in neighbouring South Kivu province. A dozen U.N. firefighters doused the burning wreckage with hoses, as black smoke from the charred fuselage blew across the closed runway. Debris was scattered across the 5-metre (yard) high laval flow and small explosions kept rescue workers at bay. The accident occurred amid an increase in aircraft movements around Goma as U.N.-backed government troops battle fighters loyal to renegade General Laurent Nkunda in clashes which have forced thousands of refugees to flee. Air travel is notoriously dangerous in Democratic Republic of Congo, with ageing planes suffering from a lack of maintenance and spare parts, but it is often the only way to transport people and goods across the vast African country slowly recovering from a devastating 1998-2003 war. An Antonov carrying tin ore crashed and burst into flames shortly after takeoff in the eastern Katanga province late last month, killing 13 people on board. Africa accounted for nearly a fifth of fatal airliner accidents last year, despite having only 3 percent of global flight departures, according to the Dutch-based Aviation Safety Network (http://aviation-safety.net). Congo, a country the size of Western Europe with only 500 km of paved roads, has one of Africa's worst air safety records and was dubbed an "embarrassment" by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) last year. In March 2006, the European Union banned all but one of Congo's 51 carriers from flying in Euro
