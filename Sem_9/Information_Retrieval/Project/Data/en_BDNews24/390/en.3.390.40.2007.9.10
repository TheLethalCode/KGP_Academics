 Dhaka, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com)The major challenge to food security in Bangladesh is the fact that 56 million people still remain below the poverty line based on direct calorie intake, said speakers at a discussion meeting Monday. Of them, 27 million living in extreme poverty are also severely undernourished, said speakers at the meeting held to disseminate the major findings of a study titled, "Relative Efficacy of Food and Cash in Enhancing Livelihood of the Extreme Poor". As part of the growing debate on "cash versus food" as a poverty alleviation strategy, the meeting stressed the need for increasing the effectiveness, efficiency and coverage of the social safety net considering the extreme vulnerability of the ultra-poor. A World Food Programme-commissioned study was carried out by the IFPRI (International Food Policy Research Institute) in May 2006. With DFID support, the study examined four major food- and cash-based interventions in Bangladesh. Meeting participants said food and cash both have advantages in certain circumstances as part of a safety net programme, but a critical look at other options would improve such future programmes. Economist Dr Hossain Zillur Rahman, in a critical review of the executive summary of the study, said: "There is still scope for exploring ways to find 'additional avenues' to engage the poor in alternative sources of work. This has not been explored in the study in detail." "Where are those productive employment opportunities which can be pursued for the poor?" he questioned. Rahman also stressed a "community approach" to addressing poverty as a strategy that has proven to be very effective in other countries. DFID Extreme Poverty Coordinator Penny Davies agreed that there is still a need for a sustainable safety net programme to lift millions of people out of extreme poverty. "We believe there remains much scope to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of safety nets." The debate over "food or cash" argues on the one hand that cash transfers to the poor enable them to purchase the food they require, rather than handing out food rations. On the other hand, studies aimed at improving the livelihood of the extreme poor have found that food transfers are often preferred by poor women whose control over cash is more constrained. Thus, most experts agree that both food and cash in combination is necessary but not sufficient to improve nutritional status  other support is also required. Those experts reviewing the present study, however, argued that to date most cash transfers have been implemented as pilot projects, making it hard to determine long-term or larger-scale effects. According to the secretary of the Planning Division, Jafar Ahmed Chowdhury, a programme with strong links to voluntary savings, raising community awareness and access to financial services such as microcredit is most effective in reducing poverty in a sustainable manner. The major findings of the study show that most of the programmes examined are well targeted, but in general the size of the cash transfers are not adequate to move people out of poverty. Programmes with strong links to markets and larger cash transfers seem to have more sustainable impacts. bdn
