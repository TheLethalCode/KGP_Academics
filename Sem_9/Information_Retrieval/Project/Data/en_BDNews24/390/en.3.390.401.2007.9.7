 Dhaka, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Party's acting chairman Anisul Islam Mahmud Thursday expelled eight presidium members from the party. A press statement made available to the media Thursday night said the action had been taken as per article 46 of the party constitution. The leaders who have been removed are Kazi Firoz Rashid, Tajul Islam Chowdhury, Golam Sarwar Milon, HM Gaffar, Golam Mosih, SMM Alam, Fakhrul Imam and Moshiur Rahman Ranga. "We already left the party earlier, so the question of ejecting us is immaterial. We cannot stay in a party which has the undemocratic article 46," Firoz Rashid said to bdnews24.com. Secretary general of the Rawshan Ershad-led JP faction Golam Masih said: "The decision to relieve is adventurous and illegal. The acting chairman does not have the jurisdiction to relieve us this way. "They have taken this illegal decision out of fear of the councillors and that is not acceptable." bdnews24
