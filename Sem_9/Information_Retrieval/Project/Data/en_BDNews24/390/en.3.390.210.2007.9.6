 LISBON, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Armed men wearing wigs robbed a famous gold museum in Portugal's Viana do Castelo early on Thursday despite the city being full of police guarding a meeting there of EU foreign ministers. Four people were injured by gunshots, including one policemen, local radio TSF said. A witness quoted by TSF said he saw the robbers exchange fire with police as they fled the museum and made their getaway in a van. "I heard them breaking the museum cabinets while police surrounded the area," Luis Costa said. A police spokeswoman confirmed the robbery had taken place but declined to give further details. EU foreign ministers and officials begin a two-day meeting in the northern city on Friday. Portugal currently holds the six-month EU presidency and the gathering is one of the biggest on its agenda. TSF said the gunmen had also robbed a jewellery store next to the museum. The van they used to escape was found burning on the outskirts of the city. The heist is the latest in a wave of violent crime across the country.
