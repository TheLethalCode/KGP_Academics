 SYDNEY, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President George W. Bush said on Thursday he and his family would attend the 2008 Beijing Olympics at the invitation of Chinese President Hu Jintao. Bush said he had eagerly accepted Hu's offer, which was extended during talks ahead of this week's Asia-Pacific summit in Sydney. Bush last visited China in 2005. "He extended an invitation to me, Laura and our family to come to the Olympics and of course I was anxious to accept," Bush said. But Bush, an avid fan of baseball and American football, made clear to Hu that he wanted to go to the Olympics "for the sports and not for any political statement," deputy national security adviser Jim Jeffrey said. Beijing sees the Olympics as a chance to showcase its development into one of the world's fastest-growing economies
