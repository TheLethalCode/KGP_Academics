With political parties taking advantage of the lifting of the ban on indoor politics to discuss the draft laws in their party forums, Sakhawat said: "Islami Oikya Jote has informed us that they are holding a meeting of their Majlish-e-Sura to discuss the draft laws."

"Many more parties, besides the 15 who are due to sit with us, have expressed their desire to participate in talks," Sakhawat said.
