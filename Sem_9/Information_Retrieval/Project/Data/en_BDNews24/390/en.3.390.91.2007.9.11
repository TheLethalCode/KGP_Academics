 MOGADISHU, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An influential Somali businessman briefly arrested over financing the Islamic Courts is weighing whether to back the movement again or turn to Somalia's interim government, an aide said on Tuesday. Abukar Omar Adan, 72, supported the sharia courts' movement during their six-month rule of Mogadishu and most of south Somalia last year. He was detained in neighbouring Kenya after allied Ethiopian and Somali government troops drove out the courts at the New Year, scattering fighters and supporters. In February, Kenya dropped an immigration case against Adan without explanation, and this weekend he showed up in Djibouti where Somali Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi flew in an effort to bring him back to his homeland. "He was not of the (Islamic) courts, he supported them morally and financially in the beginning," Adan's aide told Reuters by telephone from Djibouti. "But when they turned more destructive and uncompromising, he withdrew his support." He added: "If the courts still stand for good things, he will support them, and if the government changes its tune and stands for good things, he will support them." Adan's dialogue with Gedi came as the government seeks to shore up its power-base in Mogadishu against an Islamist-led insurgency resulting in daily attacks on government and Ethiopian positions. Several senior Islamists, meanwhile, are in Eritrea at a conference of Somali opposition figures intending to produce a new umbrella movement to press for the Ethiopians' exit. The aide said Adan, who ships commodities such as sugar and building materials to Somalia, would stay in Djibouti. "He's not going to Asmara, Addis Ababa or Mogadishu." Inside Somalia, gunmen shot dead a Somali employee of the World Health Organisation (WHO) while he was driving his car in a revenge killing apparently unrelated to the wider conflict, local authorities said. "A group of four clan militiamen killed Farah Warsame Diriye, a high-ranking WHO officer in Abudwaq because of a clan conflict," said Abdirizak Hassan Awil, chairman of Abudwaq district, 600 km (373 miles) north of Mogadishu. "He was killed because of another man killed a long time ago," he added of the morning attack. In the latest violence related to the insurgency, a grenade was hurled at a legislator's house, and police said three civilians died in gunfire after a roadside bomb targeted a military convoy carrying government soldiers. In the provincial city of Baidoa, a gang stabbed to death a government soldier, police added. Those three incidents took place on Monday night Somalia's 9 million people have endured near-ceaseless conflict and instability since warlords toppled a military dictator in 19
