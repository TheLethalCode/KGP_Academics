 NEW YORK, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Belarus pair Max Mirnyi and Victoria Azarenka seized the U.S. Open mixed doubles title with a 6-4 7-6 victory over Indian Leander Paes and American Meghann Shaughnessy on Thursday. Paes and Shaughnessy held five set points in the second set but Mirnyi and Azarenka rallied to claim their first grand slam crown together by winning the tiebreak 8-6. It was 18-year-old Azarenka's first grand slam title. For Mirnyi, it was his third mixed doubles crown at a grand slam and seventh in total. "It's been an amazing two weeks for me," Azarenka told the crowd. "I have always loved the U.S. Open and wanted to do well here so thanks to everyone, especially Max." Azarenka also beat former champion Martina Hingis on her way to the fourth round of the singles. The Belarus pair lost the Australian Open final in January and Mirnyi said he hoped the title would prove the start of a long and successful career for Azarenka. "I hope it brings the same kind of luck I brought Serena (Williams) when we won the mixed in 1998," he said. "Hopefully Victoria can learn from this and go on to become a great player." Paes praised Shaughnessy for her efforts in the second set. "We thought we had just about done enough to win that set but it just shows the calibre of those two that they came up with the goods when they needed to," he said
