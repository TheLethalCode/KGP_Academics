 SYDNEY, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President George W. Bush said on Saturday the release of a new video of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden underscored the need to show resolve in Iraq. "The tape is a reminder about the dangerous world in which we live and it is a reminder that we must work together to protect our people," Bush told reporters after a meeting with close ally, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The release of the tape coincided with the sixth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States. "I found it interesting that on the tape, Iraq was mentioned, which is a reminder that Iraq is a part of this war against extremists," Bush said. He added that the militant group was seeking to establish a safe haven in Iraq to launch attacks against the United States and its allies. "Therefore it's important that we show resolve and determination to protect ourselves and deny al Qaeda safe haven." In his first video appearance for almost three years, the al Qaeda leader said Bush was repeating the mistakes of the former Soviet Union by refusing to acknowledge losses in Iraq, but he made no specific threats. In a sign that the almost 30-minute tape was made recently, bin Laden mentioned new French President Nicolas Sarkozy and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown.
