 Dhaka, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh had another blow in the Asia Cup Hockey when they suffered a massive 10-0 defeat to Pakistan in the place-deciding match in Chennai Saturday. The defeat means Bangladesh's hope to finish sixth in the 11-nation tournament ended and they now will fight for the seventh or eighth place taking on Hong Kong Sunday. Bangladesh trailed by four goals in the first half and conceded half a dozen goals in the second half. Tariq Aziz, Muhammad Imran, Abbas Haider and Muhammad Arshad scored two goals each while Waqas Shariff and Yasir Islam scored one goal apiece. "We could not show our normal performance as a few players  goalkeeper Zahid, defender Chayan and winger Rajon  played the match with their pains and they could not put their hundred percent in the match," manager Mohammad Yousuf Ali told bdnews24.com by phone from Chennai Sunday. "It is hard to put up a better show against giants like Pakistan after having played five matches in a short time," said Ali adding that it could have been better for the side had the senior players, who were in the country, joined the team.
