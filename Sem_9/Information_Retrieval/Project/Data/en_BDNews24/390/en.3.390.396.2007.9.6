<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com)  Eighty-five people, who have recently been stripped of their jobs on the Election Commission, sent a legal notice to the commission Thursday in a prelude to suing its top officials for their "illegal decisions". A man, who lost his post of upazila election officer, said they sent the notice to chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda and commission secretary Mohammad Humayun Kabir. The commission recently retook tests of 302 upazila election officers, who were appointed by the latest political government under the leadership of former prime minister Khaleda Zia. There were reports that their appointments were made under political consideration. A total of 303 people were appointed to the post. After assuming power in mid-January, the military-backed interim administration decided to retake the tests on their efficiency. On May 18, they sat the tests. One person among 303 candidates did not appear. As many as 218 people passed the hurdle while the rest failed, the CEC said Sunday. He said those, who have passed the exams would be under observation for one year. The legal notice asked the commission officials to explain in next 20 days why they were stripped of their jobs, especially when they had got the job through the official recruiting agency, the Public Service Commission. It also asked the commission officials to explain in details why the re-tests had been taken. If the commission bosses gave no satisfactory answers, the sacked candidates would file case against them, one such candidate told bdnews24.com on condition of anonymity. bdnew
