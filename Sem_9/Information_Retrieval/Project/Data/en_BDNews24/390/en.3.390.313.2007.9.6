 ROME, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Here are some tributes to Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti, who died on Thursday aged 71: Italian film director Franco Zeffirelli: "There were tenors, and then there was Pavarotti." Spanish tenor Placido Domingo, who teamed up with Pavarotti and Jose Carreras for the "Three Tenors" performance in 1990: "I always admired his divine voice, with its unmistakeable timbre and complete vocal range.
