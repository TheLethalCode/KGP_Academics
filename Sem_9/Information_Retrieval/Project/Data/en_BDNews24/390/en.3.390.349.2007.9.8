<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com) - Sheikh Hasina's lawyer Toufique Newaz Saturday said the detained Awami League president has the legal right to talk with her relatives by telephone Saturday. Newaz said: "According to the jail code, a detained person can talk over the telephone. We have informed the jail authorities of this." After meeting Hasina at the special jail on the Sangsad Bhaban complex where she is currently held, Newaz told reporters: "The relationship the Awami League president and I have is that of a lawyer and his client. Therefore, most of what we talked about is privileged information that I cannot divulge." "I can say we discussed whether she was receiving her constitutional rights. Things are currently happening which are not consistent with the constitution. Many flaws remain in the process." Newaz added that he should be given more time to discuss Hasina's cases. bdnews24.c
