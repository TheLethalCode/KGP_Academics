 Dhaka, Sept 9 (bdnews24.com) - A three-member delegation of pro-reform BNP group led by expelled secretary geneal Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan Sunday met the chief election commissioner. The members of the delegation headed by vice-chairman Major (retd) Hafizuddin Ahmed claimed to CEC ATM Shamsul Huda that they represented the mainstream BNP. They also asked the Election Commission to make all communications to their group. The delegation gave the CEC a letter written in BNP letterhead and signed by office secretary Mofiqul Hasan Tripti. Earlier, Huda told journalists the Election Commission has not yet decided which faction they would contact. Hafizuddin later told journalists: "We don't think chairperson Khaleda Zia has expelled Mannan Bhuiyan and Ashraf Hossain. "We have trust in the wisdom and leadership of Khaleda Zia. We have doubts whether she has expelled out secretary general and the joint secretary general." He, however, termed the expulsion order "undemocratic and against the party constitution." "We have come to meet the CEC since a letter has been issued informing the commission that the BNP secretary general and the joint secretary general have been expelled. "We told the commission that we have 130 former lawmakers and numerous leaders and workers throughout the country on our side and requested the commission to contact with us." "BNP is a big political party. BNP will participate in the next election on its own. So if there is any misunderstanding among us it will be resolved." To a question, Hafizuddin said, "It merits consideration if the party secretary general can be expelled during the state of emergency." The other members of the delegation were BNP chairperson's advisors AHM Mofazzal Karim and retired Major General ZA Khan. BNP chief Khaleda Zia after her arrest on Sept 3 expelled Bhuiyan and joint secretary general Ashraf Hossain and appointed Khandaker Delwar Hossain as acting secretary general. Party assistant office secretary Rizvi Ahmed on behalf of the new secretary general sent a letter to the Election Commission conveying the chairperson's decision. bdnews24
