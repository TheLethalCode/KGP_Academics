<TEXT>
 VIENNA, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - German-born Pope Benedict on Friday said the Roman Catholic Church wanted to show "repentance" for what happened to the Jewish people during the Holocaust in which the Nazis killed some 6 million of them. The use of such a strong, specific term by the Pope, who arrived for a three-day visit to Austria, was one of the most significant times a Pontiff has referred to efforts seeking forgiveness for offences against Jews and to the Church's need to come to terms with the religious roots of anti-Semitism. Benedict made the comments to reporters aboard his plane hours before he prayed along with leaders of Vienna's Jewish community at a stark concrete monument in Vienna's Judenplatz commemorating the 65,000 Austrian Jews killed by the Nazis. The leader of the world's 1.1 billion Roman Catholics, who stopped for about 10 minutes at the monument in a driving rain, said he wanted his visit to the memorial to show "our sadness, our repentance, our friendship with our Jewish brothers." Abraham Foxman, national director of the U.S.-based Anti-Defamation League, told Reuters: "I welcome this. Repentance is a powerful, significant word in Catholic parlance. I think this will help repair some strains of recent months." Jews expressed concern in July over the possible re-introduction in the old Latin Mass of a Good Friday prayer in which Catholics prayed for the conversion of Jews In 1998 the local Church put a plaque on a nearby building reading: "Today, Christianity regrets its share in responsibility for the persecution of Jews and realises its failure." The silent prayer at Judenplatz followed a visit to the former Nazi death camp at Auschwitz in Poland last year, where he asked why God remained silent when millions of people, mostly Jews, were murdered there. Before World War Two, Austria's Jewish community numbered some 200,000 and was one of Europe's most vibrant. There are about 10,000 Austrian Jews today. The Pope served briefly in the Hitler Youth during the war when membership in the Nazi paramilitary organisation was compulsory, although he was never a member of the Nazi party and his family opposed Hitler's regime. Upon his arrival in Vienna, Benedict was greeted with military honours and welcomed by Austrian President Heinz Fischer and members of government, although celebrations had to be moved indoors into a hangar due to strong rain. The main purpose of Benedict's trip is to visit the 850-year old shrine of Mariazell on Saturday where some 33,000 pilgrims including 70 cardinals are expected to join him. He will cap the visit with a Mass in Vienna's 13th century St Stephen's Cathedral on Sunday. His visit of the predominantly Catholic country will also underscore the problems of a national church which has been debilitated by internal dissent, dwindling church attendance and that found itself living in the shadow of sexual abuse scandals. In the 1990s, a sex abuse scandal forced the late archbishop of Vienna, Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer, to retire after allegations that he had molested a schoolboy 20 years earlier. In 2004, the bishop of St Poelten resigned after a scandal involving pornographic pictures at a seminary. bdnews24.com/lq/1858hrs "I hope that I still can help in the healing of these wounds," Benedict told reporters, adding that he wanted "to say thank you to all those who suffered in these past years". He also praised those "who, in a Church of sinners, nonetheless recognised the faith of Christ." In his chat with reporters aboard the plane, the Pope said he wanted his trip to remind people in a Europe where religious participation has been diminishing that "a life without God does not succ
