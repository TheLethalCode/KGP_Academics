 Dhaka, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com)  Inflation, one of the major indices of the economy, will soar higher in the wake of floods, economists said Monday. The runaway inflation has crossed the double-digit figure, the first in two decades. According to government data, inflation on a point-to-point basis rose to 10.2 percent in July from 9.20 in June. Economists said the inflation rate would climb higher because of the floods and the latest available figures did not reflect the impact of floods. The knock-on effect of the deluge on the economy will be felt in August and September, which will further hike the inflation rate. "The statistics on inflation for July did not reflect the crop loss due to the floods. The effects of the flooding would be reflected in the August-September inflation. The inflation would rise further then," president of Bangladesh Economic Association Dr Qazi Kholiquzzaman told bdnews24.com. He said the inflation rate went double-digit much earlier in unofficial counts. If the calculation was done based on real figures the rate of inflation would be much higher than the government figures. According to Bangladesh Bank statistics, during 1987-88 floods the inflation rose to highest 11.42 percent. The inflation rate on point-to-point basis was 9.20 percent in June. Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said the government was desperate to keep inflation in check and blamed it on an abnormal rise in food crop prices on the international market. He told reporters Sunday the government was not losing sleep over inflation even though it had treaded into the double-digit territory. The measures the government had taken would help make inflation bearable soon, Azizul said. bdnews24.
