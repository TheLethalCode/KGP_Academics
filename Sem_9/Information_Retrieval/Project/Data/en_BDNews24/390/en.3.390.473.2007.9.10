<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com) - Law adviser Mainul Hosein Monday said that the government had lifted the ban on indoor politics with no strings attached. "We have provided explanations and definitions," he told reporters in his office, when he was asked whether any condition had been attached to the lifting of the ban on indoor politics. He said, "It is not a condition, rather an explanation. We did not withdraw the ban on indoor politics on any condition." He said that indoor politics had become part of law and it would be considered a part of the emergency powers rules. Replying to a question Mainul said indoor politics had, in fact, been going on in a form, but politicians had no legal right to it. The information adviser said, "Now, their legal rights have been established." Replying to another question, adviser Mainul said, "Offices of the political parties have been reopened. However, if any indiscipline is created due to any faction of any party concerned, the government cannot control it." Noting that the abysmal political situation improved following the arrest of corrupt politicians, he said that no more lists of corrupt politicians would be published. Now, the Anticorruption Commission will look into the issue, he added. Mainul said the government was pondering whether some rules of the emergency powers rules could be relaxed. Asked whether a situation fit for withdrawing the emergency powers rules had been created, the adviser said: "We are trying to understand the overall situation. The government will take decision after taking everything into account." He said people have to remain cautious about the politicians because they "created a crisis" in the country. On whether the convicted politicians would be able to participate in elections in future, he said that as per the constitution of Bangladesh, a person could not participate in elections if he was sentenced for more than two years in any case. Commenting that the government had succeeded in coping up with the flood situation, the adviser said that no government in the past could face the floods the way the present government had. bdnew
