 NEW DELHI, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's cricket board has dismissed local media reports that Sachin Tendulkar is set to retire from one-day cricket. The Indian Express daily reported on its front page, quoting unnamed sources, that one-day cricket's leading batsman had discussed quitting the format with friends in order to extend his test career. Tendulkar, who top-scored in India's win in the penultimate game over England at Oval on Wednesday, was even contemplating making the move at Lord's on Saturday when the tour ends with the decisive final match, the reports said. "I spoke to Tendulkar after last night's game and he told me it is not true," the board's chief administrative officer, Ratnakar Shetty, told Reuters on Thursday. "There is no substance to it, it is pure media speculation." Tendulkar, 34, has recently spoken about how difficult it was to recover for back-to-back one-day games, having suffered a series of injuries in the past seven years. He has suffered back, hand, foot and elbow injuries, mainly attributed to the wear and tear of constant playing since he burst onto the international scene as a 16-year-old in 1989. He also opted out of the inaugural Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa starting on Tuesday. Tendulkar is the leading one-day batsman, having aggregated a record 15,395 runs with 41 hundreds from 394 matches. He has also scored a record 37 test centuries. India face Australia in a seven-match one-day series starting on Sept. 29 which will be followed by a test and one-day series against the visiting Pakistan
