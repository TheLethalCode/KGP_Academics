 Dhaka, Sept 9 (bdnews24.com)  Stocks surged for a ninth day Sunday as investors rushed into heavy buying to power the benchmark general index to an all-time high. Power and banking shares hit new highs to propel the robust market growth. "It appears that prices of many issues have been overvalued. Investors should be cautious," said Ziaul Haque Khondker, managing director of ICB, a state-run investment bank. Multinationals powered the rally but stocks with small market capilatisation gained as well. Insurance stocks also went up, but IT shares continued the downtrend. Mutual fund, cement and pharmaceuticals stocks closed mixed. The DGEN or general index ended at an all-time high of 2599.69 points, up 45.77 points or 1.79 percent from the previous day.

A total of 81,63,813 shares worth Tk 1.88 billion were traded, and 114 issues gained, 68 lost and 20 closed unchanged. "A correction is rationally expected if the market crosses 2600 points," said Yawer Sayeed, who helps manage about Tk 850 million in funds with AIMS of Bangladesh. Market bigwig BRAC Bank, the leader with Tk 269.76 million in turnover, surged 8.58 percent to hit a record high of Tk 1281.25.
