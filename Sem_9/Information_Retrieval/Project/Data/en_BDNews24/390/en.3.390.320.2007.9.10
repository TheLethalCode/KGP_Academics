 Dhaka, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com)  The police Monday denied BNP's new secretary-general Khandaker Delwar Hossain entry to the party headquarters in Naya Paltan, a day after the government allowed indoor politics. "The government has curbed my political right [by doing so]," he alleged. "The government has deviated from its announcement by not allowing us to enter the party office even after lifting a ban on parlour politics," Delwar told reporters and several hundred leaders and workers in front of the BNP central office at 1:35pm. Party followers clapped and chanted slogans in a show of support for detained BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia. Delwar drove to the central office at around 1:30pm and approached the collapsible gate of the main door through a crowd. Police stood in his way in front of the gate. He introduced himself to the on-duty officer as the party secretary general. "I have come to attend office. Let me get in," Delwar said. "You cannot go in. I am going to talk to the high officials," the officer told him and went away. After six minutes, the officer told him they were under orders not to let anyone in without permission and that Delwar had no permission. "You see what sort of ban on indoor politics the government has lifted. On the one hand they are saying they have allowed indoor politics and on the other, I'm not being allowed to do my duty as party secretary general. "Refusal of entry into party office in this way is an infringement on fundamental rights." "Thousands of leaders and activists are waiting in front of BNP office. They are not being allowed to enter. This is illegal and undemocratic," he said amid cheers and applause before leaving with some leaders. BNP leader Akhteruzzaman told reporters: "The police have committed a major crime by stopping us entering our own office today. This is illegal. "This same police guarded corrupt persons in last five years. Even now they are supporting them by not allowing us to enter." Delwar was accompanied, among others, by party colleagues RA Gani, Syed Masud Ahmed Rumi, Sohrab Hossain, Akhteruzzaman, Shirin Sultana and Helen Zerin Khan. bdnews24
