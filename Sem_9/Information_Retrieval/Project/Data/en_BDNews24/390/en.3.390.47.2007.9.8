 TORONTO, Sep 08 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- Oscar winners Reese Witherspoon and George Clooney were set to parade up the red carpets on Friday at the Toronto International Film Festival, setting the stage for a weekend of star-filled, gala premieres. Witherspoon and actor Jake Gyllenhaal headline movie marquees in thriller "Rendition," which explores the U.S. practice of detaining terrorist suspects in foreign jails, and Clooney stars in "Michael Clayton," a look at a "fixer" of problems in a big city law firm. Those two movies follow Thursday's debut of Jodie Foster's "The Brave One" about a woman who goes on a vigilante killing spree in New York. All three movies reinforce themes that organizers said run throughout the 10-day Toronto International Film Festival. The backdrop for "Rendition" is the U.S.-led wars on terrorism and in Iraq while and "Brave One" and "Clayton" give audiences a look at people facing personal and professional crises. "Until you are forced into a situation that challenges you, that changes you, you can't know who you would be," Foster has said about her role as Erica Bain, a New York radio personality who goes on a killing rampage after her fiancee is murdered. The Toronto film festival annually serves as a launch for movies that fill theaters throughout the fall and compete for Oscars. This year, the human toll of war seems to be on the mind of many filmmakers., Thursday's opening night movie, `Fugitive Pieces,' looked at Holocaust survivors living in Canada and still set to debut is `In the Valley of Elah,' starring Tommy Lee Jones and Charlize Theron in a tale about a murder among a platoon of U.S. Marines home from Iraq. In a recent interview, Theron told Reuters she saw the movie as a `personal, intimate story' about how war impacts young men, women and their families when the return home. Other major premieres in the early days here include `The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford,' starring Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck in an exploration of how notoriety impacts people. `Elizabeth: The Golden Age' has Cate Blanchett reprising her Oscar-nominated role from 1998's `Elizabeth' as Queen Elizabeth I dealing with treachery in her royal court
