 JERUSALEM, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas agreed on Monday to create teams to tackle Palestinian statehood issues, a move both sides described as a step towards more substantive talks. But Israel cautioned against expecting major final status breakthroughs, either before or during a US-sponsored conference planned for mid- to late November. Washington is pushing a reluctant Israel to make tangible progress to avoid disappointment at the conference, which Western diplomats said could culminate in an agreement to relaunch full-blown peace negotiations. After their three-hour meeting, Olmert and Abbas "emphasised the importance of their joint commitment to a two-state solution and decided to appoint teams in order to work towards achieving this goal", said Olmert's spokeswoman, Miri Eisin. Abbas aide Saeb Erekat said the appointment of the teams was a "significant development" but offered few details. "They (Olmert and Abbas) now believe it is time to take it to the next level, to engage on the substance of how to achieve a two-state solution," Erekat said. The Israeli leader is seeking a broadbrush "declaration of principles" for the November conference. Abbas wants an explicit "framework" agreement with a timeline for implementation. It is still unclear to what extent Olmert is prepared to meet Abbas's appeal to delve deeply into the core "final status" issues of Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees and the borders of a Palestinian state. A senior Palestinian official close to Abbas said Washington was exerting "immense pressure" on both sides to come to the conference with an agreed document. Eisin said the leaders did not set timetables during their session in Olmert's official residence in Jerusalem. "Both sides would like to see the success of the international meeting, but the meeting (in November) is not the end-game," she said. Olmert and Abbas have been meeting regularly since Hamas Islamists seized control of the Gaza Strip in June and are keen to show progress ahead of next week's visit of U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Eisin said Olmert and Abbas had agreed to meet again within two weeks. An opinion poll found that only 26 percent of the Palestinians it surveyed in the West Bank and Gaza Strip expect the Middle East conference to succeed. The findings by the independent Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research showed that a final peace deal, mirroring a U.S. proposal in 2000 to establish a Palestinian state in nearly all of the West Bank and in the entire Gaza Strip, would be supported by just 46 percent of Palestinians. The bilateral meetings and the conference are part of a U.S.-led campaign to shore up the Fatah leader's hold on power in the occupied West Bank and to isolate Hamas in Gaza. Olmert has also been weakened politically since last year's war in Lebanon, raising doubts among Israelis and Palestinians over his ability to deliver on any peace promises. Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad told his cabinet after the meeting, which he also attended, that the time had come to "move from the stage of verbal discussions to the drafting of proposals", a Palestinian official said. Eisin said ministers in Olmert's cabinet would separately begin holding face-to-face meetings with their Palestinian counterparts in a sign of growing cooperation. During Monday's talks, Olmert told Abbas he would ask his cabinet to approve the release of Palestinian prisoners as a goodwill gesture. Israel is expected to free around 100 Fatah prisoners for the Ramadan fast month, which begins this we
