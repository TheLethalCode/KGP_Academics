<TITLE> Jodie Foster finds her inner killer in `Brave One' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TORONTO, Sep 08 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- In real life, two-time Oscar winner Jodie Foster is a mother and a fierce gun control advocate. But in her latest movie, she plays a stone-cold vengeance killer and admits she finds it oddly appealing. Holding and shooting a gun even in a movie she told Reuters on Friday, "gives you the power to say, 'I live, you die,' and that is horrifyingly satisfying." Her new film, `The Brave One,' debuted to a packed house late on Thursday at the Toronto International Film Festival, and opens across North America on September 14. It is her latest thriller in a line that includes `Panic Room' and `Flightplan.' Only this time the actress who has played nearly every possible role from cute kid to rape victim is predator instead of prey. She portrays Erica Bain, a Manhattan radio personality who goes on a killing spree after her fiancee is murdered in a Central Park attack. The movie explores whether people, when pushed beyond their limits, will turn the other cheek or hit back. Foster said she doesn't know whether circumstances might cause her to turn into a vigilante. "I'd like to say, 'no' and 'absolutely not.' But here I am having had this experience and walked in those shoes and you find a side of yourself you didn't know," Foster said. "This stranger is, at once, monstrously human and also quite beautiful in a strange way," she added. KILLER FOSTER Foster, 44, won her first Academy Award playing a rape victim in 1988's `The Accused.' Three years later her turn as an FBI agent on the trail of serial killer Hannibal Lecter in `The Silence of the Lambs' earned her a second Oscar. Director Neil Jordan, whose hits include 1992's `The Crying Game,' called Foster one of most versatile actresses of our time and said she was perfect for the role because audiences know her as someone who always occupied the moral high ground. This time her morals are constantly challenged by questions people often ask themselves if pushed, should we push back? And just how far and how hard should we take on our enemies? `The Brave One' is a thriller, but one with a greater emphasis on psychology than a typical action-packed movie. Questions the movie raises about violence and revenge seem to have taken on even greater significance in the years since the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York, a point that Jordan acknowledges. But he said sensitivity to 9/11 only came up when dealing with certain words or scenes, and not with the overall tone of `The Brave One.' "It's a very sophisticated movie in an unsophisticated (thriller) genre. It hits people viscerally, but there's so much to talk about," Foster said with a gleam in her eye
