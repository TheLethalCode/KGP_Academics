 KHARTOUM, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sudanese government planes bombed a rebel-controlled town in Darfur on Monday, an insurgent group said, hours after the government said it was investigating a bloody rebel raid on one of its bases last month. Abu-Bakr Mohammed Kadu, a field commander in the Sudanese Liberation Army's Unity (SLA-Unity) faction, said government aircraft bombed Haskanita then ground forces entered the town in northern Darfur. "The clashes are still going on," he told Reuters just after 4.30 p.m. local time (1330 GMT). He said Haskanita was predominantly a civilian area but could not give an estimate of casualties. Sudanese military officials were not available for comment. Kadu could not confirm whether the attack was in retaliation for a raid by the SLA-Unity and the rebel Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) on a government base just over 200 km (125 miles) east of Haskanita at the end of August. The justice ministry said on Monday it had launched an inquiry into six JEM members who it suspects masterminded the attack that killed 41 people at the government base in the town of Wad Banda in the Kordofan region across the border from Darfur. Reports of Monday's attack on Haskanita came seven weeks before the start of peace talks between Khartoum and rebel groups, expected to take place in Libya on Oct. 27. It also coincided with renewed calls from the United Nations for Sudan and rebel groups to cease hostilities and prepare for the arrival of a 26,000 strong force of U.N./African Union peacekeepers. International experts estimate 200,000 people have died in more than four years of conflict in Darfur and 2.5 million others have fled their homes. Washington calls the violence genocide, a term European governments are reluctant to use. Khartoum says only 9,000 people have been killed. PARIS MISSION U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called for an end to hostilities as he wrapped up a six-day tour of Sudan, Libya and Chad on Sunday. "There must be an end to violence and insecurity, a strengthened ceasefire supported by the incoming UNAMID-Hybrid Operation, as well as an improvement in the humanitarian situation," he said. Ban said the priority now was to persuade as many Darfur rebel groups as possible to attend the Libyan talks. Riek Machar, the vice president of the semi-autonomous southern Sudan, flew to France late on Sunday with a team of senior politicians to try and persuade one key Darfur rebel leader to attend the negotiations. Abdel Wahid Mohamed el-Nur, the Paris-based founder of the Sudan Liberation Movement, has so far refused to take part, demanding an end to hostilities in Darfur before talks. "They've gone to convince him to join the peace talks process," South Sudan Minister for Presidential Affairs Luka Biong told Reuters. Another rebel leader, Suleiman Jamous, said on Monday he was still waiting to hear when he would be allowed to fly to Kenya for medical treatment, six days after Sudan's president promised he would be allowed to leave. Jamous, the Sudan Liberation Army's humanitarian coordinator, who needs a stomach biopsy, has been under effective house arrest in a UN hospital near Darfur for more than a year. Sudan originally threatened to arrest Jamous if he left UN care but President Omar Hassan al-Bashir last week gave Ban a pledge that Jamous would be able to leave as soon as possible. Bashir held talks with the British Foreign Office Minister for Africa, Lord Malloch Brown, who arrived in Khartoum on Monday ahead of a one-day visit to Darf
