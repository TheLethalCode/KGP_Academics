 Dhaka, Sep 10 (bdnews24.com)  A former army major, Sujan Ahmed, has been arrested with Tk 50,000 in extorted cash and a pistol and remanded for one day, police said Monday. Investigating officer Didarul Islam, a sub-inspector of Mohammadpur Police Station, said the owner of the overseas employment agency, Mahinur Miah, filed the case against the ex-army officer on charges of conning money from his firm. Didarul said Sujan was forced out of his job on Bangladesh Army but could not confirm when. The police are questioning him after the court granted remand. Didarul also told bdnews24.com that the pistol seized from Sujan was a licensed one. According to case details, Sujan asked Mahinur to come by the Anurag Community Center in Mohammadpur on Aug 30. Mahinur met four people, including Sujan, all of them claiming to be army majors. They demanded Tk 5 lakh from Mahinur after alleging that he was exploiting people by sending them abroad with false employment prospects. They threatened Mahinur with detention by joint forces, it was alleged in the case. Mahinur paid the ex-army major Tk 1 lakh on Sep 6 and a further Tk 2 lakh on Sep 7. Mahinur promised to hand over the rest of the money on Sep 9, but could only give Tk 50,000 on the day, as he could not manage any more, according to the details in the case. However, Mahinur took Sujan to his Panthapath home that day after harassment by the former officer for the rest of the amount. In the meantime, relatives of Mahinur had called Tejgaon police on suspicions aroused by Sujan's conversations. Police arrested the former major at Mahinur's home with the Tk 50,000 he took that night and a pistol he carried on him. Tejgaon police handed Sujan to Mohammadpur police after Mahinur filed the case Monday. The court granted a one-day remand after the investigating officer asked for five days. bdnews24.co
