<TITLE> Small Sunni Arab party returns to Iraq parliament </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BAGHDAD, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A small Sunni Arab political party returned to Iraqi's parliament on Saturday after a boycott of more than two months, ending walkouts by various factions that have disrupted the legislature. The Iraqi National Dialogue Front, which has 11 seats in the 275-member legislature, suspended its participation in June, partly over the sacking at the time of the speaker, a Sunni Arab from a larger Sunni Arab bloc. Mustafa al-Hiti, a senior member of the Dialogue Front, said the party had returned because most of its demands had been met. He did not elaborate, but the speaker, Mahmoud al-Mashhadani, was reinstated in July. The party's decision to attend sessions again follows the return to parliament in recent months of the main Sunni Arab bloc, the Accordance Front, and also a faction loyal to Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. Parliament resumed hearings this week after a month's break. Legislators are under growing pressure from the United States to pass major laws aimed at drawing minority Sunni Arabs more firmly into the political process. The lawmakers complain that the government has yet to submit most of the drafts.
