 Dhaka, Sept 9 (bdnews24.com)  More areas in northern parts of the country went underwater after heavy late monsoon rains fed rivers to deluge lowlands Sunday, sparking fears of a more prolonged and devastating flooding. The Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) said 14 rivers including major ones such as Padma, Brahmaputra, Jamuna, Gumti, Teesta, Surma and Kushiara were flowing above danger levels at 24 points. Water Development Board (WDB) officials said some 20 districts were flooded after three days of rain swelled major rivers. Some 60 villages have been inundated and nearly 200 houses in Rangpur district washed away due to erosion of the Teesta River. Heavy rainfall and flash floods rolling in from northern hilly regions have also affected areas of Nilphamari, Lalmonirhat, Gaibandha, Kurigram, Bogra, Pabna, Sirajganj, Jamalpur and Sherpur in the north and low-lying areas in Feni to the south with the Teesta, Dharla, and the Dudhkumar swelling. The northeastern districts of Sylhet, Sunamganj, Habiganj, Moulvibazar, Netrakona and Sherpur went further underwater with waters coming down the hills, the flood warning centre said. Deluge in the southeastern Comilla, Feni, Noakhali, Chittagong, Rangamati, Bandarban and Khagrachhari districts may worsen Monday, the FFWC said. The WDB officials said active monsoon winds are causing medium to heavy rainfall in Bangladesh and the surrounding Indian states of West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Behar. The WDB forecast added the situation might further worsen in the north, middle, south and south-west due to swelling rivers in the Brahmaputra and Ganges basins. Thousands of people have been marooned in Kazipur and Shahzadpur upazilas of Sirajganj district. bdnews24.com/
