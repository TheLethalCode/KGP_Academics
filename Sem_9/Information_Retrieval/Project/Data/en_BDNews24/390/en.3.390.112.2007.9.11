 SACRAMENTO, Calif., Sept 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A federal judge sentenced an American to 24 years in prison for material support to terrorists by attending a paramilitary training camp in Pakistan and lying about it to US officials. A jury in Sacramento, California, convicted Hamid Hayat in April 2006 for his activities between 2003 and 2005. Federal prosecutors had sought a 35-year sentence and his defense had argued that he should spend no more than 15 years behind bars. "It is because of prosecutions like this that we have prevented another attack against the United States," McGregor Scott, the US attorney for the Eastern District of California, told reporters. "The threat to our nation demonstrated by the acts of the 9/11 terrorists was brought home with the revelations of Hamid Hayat's actions two years ago," Scott said. In June 2005, federal investigators announced they uncovered an al Qaeda cell in Lodi, California, south of Sacramento, where Hamid lived with his father, Umer, an ice cream truck driver. During the trial, prosecutors presented no evidence that either of the Hayats had any direct links to the terrorist organization or any plans to launch a terrorist attack. Both Hayats are US citizens, but the American-born son retained the services of a court interpreter on Monday to hear the proceedings in Urdu. He wore an orange prison jump suit and had shaved a beard he had in previous court appearances. "It was a sad day for us, but we are very confident he is going to get out on appeal," Umer Hayat told reporters on the steps of the court after the sentencing. "He is innocent." The father, an immigrant from Pakistan, pleaded guilty last year to a single count of lying in an unrelated 2003 incident. He was initially charged with lying to the FBI about his son's alleged attendance at the camp. SEEKING A RETRIAL Defense lawyers immediately filed a motion asking that the imposition of the sentence be delayed pending a reconsideration of the verdict. "Hayat was charged with the class of offense most likely to inflame the passions and prejudices of an American jury in wake of the 9/11 attacks," two of lawyers wrote. "The United States attorney's office fanned the flames of that potential jury bias by announcing Hamid Hayat's arrest was due to the unearthing of an al Qaeda cell in Lodi, California, an exercise in propaganda that the government has since admitted was without any factual basis." The filing also said Hayat's original attorney -- who is still involved in the case -- had never before defended a client in a criminal case. "She knew nothing about defending a client in a complex federal proceeding," Hayat's new lawyers said in arguing for a trial because he did not receive effective representation. Government officials said under sentencing rules Hayat would spend at least 20 years behind bars and then would be subject to a decade of supervised release. The FBI's probe was aided by an informant in the Muslim community of Lodi, a farm town in California's Central Valley.
