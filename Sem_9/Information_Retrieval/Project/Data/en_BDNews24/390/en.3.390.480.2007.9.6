<TITLE> Kosovo a test of EU foreign policy-Britain, France </TITLE>

 PARIS, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Securing agreement on the final status of Kosovo, Serbia's breakaway province, is a key test of the European Union's foreign and security policy, the foreign ministers of Britain and France said on Thursday. Serbia had to present proposals acceptable to Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority if Belgrade was to continue to oppose Kosovo independence, France's Bernard Kouchner and his British counterpart David Miliband said in a joint opinion piece.

The EU plans to launch an 1,850-strong rule of law mission, the largest in its history, that would take over law enforcement and supervisory duties from the United Nations. But a split in the EU over Kosovo recognition could scupper the plan, and Kouchner and Miliband said the European Union should not shirk its responsibilities over Kosovo. UN mediator Martti Ahtisaari has proposed independence for Kosovo under EU supervision, an outcome resisted by Serbia, whose stance is backed by UN veto-holder Russia. Kouchner and Miliband said the ball was now in Serbia's court: "If Belgrade persists in finding Mr Ahtisaari's conclusions unacceptable, it is up to it to propose alternatives that are likely to be accepted in Kosovo. "As for Pristina, it has to reflect on the ways of convincing Serbia and the Serbs of Kosovo of its attachment to a multi-ethnic Kosovo, shorn of all discrimination," they wrote, referring to the province's Albanian-majority leadership. "If no agreement is possible, the proposals of Mr Ahtisaari remain, in our view, the best way to advance. For one thing is certain -- the status quo is not a solutio
