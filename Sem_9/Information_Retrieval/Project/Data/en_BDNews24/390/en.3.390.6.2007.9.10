 Dhaka, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com)  The caretaker government amended the emergency powers rules Monday, introducing bail provisions for family members of persons charged with corruption, an adviser said. The amended rules will come out in a gazetted notice, law and information adviser Mainul Hosein told reporters in his office. Until the amendment, the emergency powers rules had no provision allowing bail appeals for the family members, the adviser said. The court will now be able to entertain bail petitions and may grant them, Mainul said. The amendment purports that in case the spouse, under-18 children, unmarried daughter, mother, mother-in-law or sister are implicated as accomplices or co-accused in a corruption case with the main accused, bail petitions for the co-accused may be filed with the court or tribunal. bdnews24.com
