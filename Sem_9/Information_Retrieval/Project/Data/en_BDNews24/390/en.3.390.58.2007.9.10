 BAGHDAD, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki told lawmakers on Monday his government had stopped Iraq sliding into civil war and pledged his commitment to reconciling the country's majority Shi'ite and Sunni Arabs. Maliki spoke in a formal address to parliament hours before American officials were to deliver a vital progress report on Iraq that could influence future US strategy. He told lawmakers that security gains had been made across Iraq, but added his forces needed more time to take over full security responsibility from US-led foreign troops. US President George W Bush is under mounting pressure to withdraw some troops after more than four years of war that has killed more than 3,700 US soldiers and tens of thousands of Iraqis as well as forced millions to flee their homes. Bush's top officials in Iraq, military commander General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker, will give their assessment later on Monday to the Democrat-controlled Congress on the president's decision to send 30,000 extra troops to Iraq. Their testimony could be a turning point and is considered crucial to any move by Bush on force levels as he faces demands from Democrats and some Republicans for US troops to leave. Maliki, a Shia Islamist, defended his government in the face of blistering criticism from both Iraqi and US lawmakers. Some Democratic legislators in the United States have even called for him to be replaced. "We succeeded in stopping Iraq from sliding toward civil war, which was threatening our beloved country," Maliki said. "We are absolutely confident that national reconciliation is our only choice, which will take Iraq to safe shores." When he finished his speech, Maliki took questions from lawmakers in a rare direct exchange between the prime minister and parliament. A US official, who asked not to be identified, said on Sunday that Petraeus and Crocker would argue that a major pullout of forces would hurt progress made since troop levels were increased to 168,000. Petraeus and Crocker are expected to highlight improved security but criticise the country's politicians for failing to pass laws seen as vital to healing deep sectarian divisions. Bush's top officials in Iraq speak before a joint session of the House Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees. Petraeus' testimony starts at 1630 GMT. Maliki has resisted demands from the influential political bloc loyal to anti-American Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr to set a timetable for the withdrawal of US troops. "Despite improved security, we still realise we need more time and effort so our security forces can handle security from the multinational forces," Maliki said. Maliki has also been combative in recent weeks, appearing regularly before the media to respond to his detractors. But government decision-making has been paralysed since more than a dozen ministers from both Shi'ite and Sunni Arab political parties quit his cabinet. There is little sign that laws demanded by Washington will be passed soon. They include legislation that would share Iraq's vast oil wealth among its ethnic and sectarian groups. Top Iraqi officials have warned that a premature U.S. troop pullout would tip the country into an all-out civil war that would engulf the region. Citing US officials, The New York Times reported on Monday Petraeus has recommended that decisions on major troop cuts in Iraq be delayed until March 2008. A majority of Americans are sceptical of what Petraeus is expected to recommend and most support setting a timetable to withdraw forces regardless of what is going on in Iraq, according to a USA Today/Gallup poll conducted released on Monday. Bush raised the prospect of a troop drawdown on a visit to Iraq a week ago, but said any withdrawals had to come from a position of streng
