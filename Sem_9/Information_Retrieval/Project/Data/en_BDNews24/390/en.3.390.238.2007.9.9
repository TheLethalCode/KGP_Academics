 Dhaka, Sep 9 (bdnews24.com) - The caretaker government Sunday approved purchase of one lakh tonnes of wheat at a cost of Tk 260.53 crore. Finance adviser and chairman of the advisory committee on purchases AB Mirza Azizul Islam approved the deal. "The wheat has already been imported by the private sector and the government will procure one lakh tonnes through local tenders," Azizul told reporters. "The price per kilogram of wheat will cost between Tk 25.78 and Tk 26.83 depending on the haulage distance from the import point," he said. Officials with the food ministry told bdnews24.com that the wheat would be procured by September 20. Azizul stressed there was no shortfall in food stocks: "The current food stock is higher than the corresponding period of last year." The advisory committee also approved a central effluent treatment plant to be established at Savar's leather industrial park at a cost of Tk 296 crore. "I hope once the plant is set up businessmen will not hesitate to relocate to Savar from Hazaribagh in the city," Azizul said. The committee also approved a land development project under the third phase of Uttara Model Residential Town at a rate of Tk 146-164 per cubic metre. bdnew
