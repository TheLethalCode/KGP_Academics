<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com) -- The readymade garments industry, the country's main foreign exchange earner, is in a crisis, factory owners claimed Saturday. Export orders for July-September dropped by 35 percent from the same period of last year, they said, while expressing doubt about whether they would be able to reach the target of exporting garments worth $12 billion in fiscal 2007-08. At a press conference Saturday, Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association president Anwar-ul Alam Chowdhury Parvez said: "We are very worried, as export orders have dropped by 35 percent this year over that in the corresponding period last year." The BGMEA president claimed that last year's labour unrest in the garment factories, and the unstable political situation, were responsible for the fall in export orders. He said that there was doubt whether many factory owners would be able to pay the next three months' wages and two bonuses to their workers. Given the situation, Anwar-ul Alam demanded that the government provide loans, on easy terms, for six months to the factory owners through commercial banks to enable them to pay wages and bonus to the workers. Demanding that the readymade garment industry be declared a thrust sector to face the present crisis as well as formation of a separate ministry for it, the BGMEA president said: "There is a $500 billion market for the garments and textile industry in the world now. If we can capture even 4 percent of the world market we can raise the amount of exports to $25 billion." "It is not impossible to earn $50 billion from the garments sector in the next 10 years. Besides it will create jobs for one crore more workers. For this, different types of policy support from the government is required." "The garments sector has to work in coordination with different ministries and divisions due to which time is wasted in taking many important decisions," Anwar-ul Alam said. "If there was a separate ministry for garments industry like the jute ministry decision-making would be much easier. Factory owners would not have to run from one ministry to another." Replying to a question, he said: "Bangladesh will not be much affected if China enters the US and European garments markets. Bangladesh enjoys a reputation in the international market. We are not afraid of China. But government cooperation is needed to uphold the existing reputation." Anwar-ul Alam said: "The orders diverted from Bangladesh went to several other countries including Vietnam and Cambodia." The press conference was held at the BGMEA office at Karwan Bazar. BGMEA vice president Faisal Samad, Ferdous Parvez Bivon and ABM Shamsuddin also spoke. bdnews
