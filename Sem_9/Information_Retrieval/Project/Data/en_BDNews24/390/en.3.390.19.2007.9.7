 GAZA, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Security forces from the Hamas Islamist movement clashed with protesters in the Gaza Strip on Friday, as members of the rival Fatah faction gathered to pray in defiance of a ban imposed on open-air gatherings. Witnesses said that Hamas's Executive Force members beat people, used stun grenades and fired in the air to try to prevent the gatherings.

Fatah officials accused Hamas of killing one of their members overnight and said 26 of its members had been detained over the past day.
