 Dhaka, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain Friday brushed aside Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan's claim that his faction represented the mainstream BNP. "Those expelled are no more in the party. Their claim of being the mainstream BNP is illegal," he told bdnews24.com after special prayers organised for detained party chief Khaleda Zia in the evening. "I participated in the doa mahfil (prayers) at the mosque in my village home. [Prayers] were held all over the country for the BNP chairperson." At midday, advisor to BNP chairperson ASM Hannan Shah told journalists the chairperson's decision on expulsion was timely. "The BNP has got rid of problem elements through the use of the chairperson's discretionary power. The discretionary power will not be removed in the future." "Mannan Bhuiyan and Ashraf Hossain are nobody in the BNP. After their expulsion we will now be able to work properly," he said. Former lawmaker BM Ashraf Uddin Nizam was present. bdnew
