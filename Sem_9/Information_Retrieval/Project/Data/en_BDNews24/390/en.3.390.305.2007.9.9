 ISLAMABAD, Sept 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani authorities have detained more than 2,000 supporters of exiled former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, his party said on Sunday, the eve of his planned return to challenge President Pervez Musharraf. Sharif, ousted by army chief Musharraf in 1999, says he is determined to fly home from London on Monday despite an appeal from a Saudi official for him to stay away for the sake of Pakistani stability. "The way the government has acted has proven our point that there is no democracy under Musharraf, there is dictatorship in the country," said Sharif's spokesman, Ahsan Iqbal. He said authorities had detained more than 2,000 activists from Sharif's party in Punjab province, Sharif's political power base: "Politically, they are very sacred of a big show of popularity upon his arrival". A provincial police official said 250 "trouble makers" had been picked up. The return of Sharif is a serious challenge for Musharraf, who has lost much support since trying to dismiss the country's top judge in March. The government has been trying to block Sharif's return, which comes as Musharraf is preparing to try to secure another term in a presidential election by the national and provincial assemblies some time between Sept. 15 and Oct. 15. A general election is due around the end of the year. "TENSION" Musharraf sent Sharif to Saudi Arabia in 2000 as part of what the government says was an agreement that Sharif would stay in exile for 10 years. In return, he avoided a life sentence on hijacking and corruption charges. Pakistan says the Saudi Arabian royal family and assassinated Lebanese leader Rafik al-Hariri guaranteed the exile deal. Sharif said on Saturday, he understood the agreement was for five years exile. The Supreme Court last month said Sharif had an "inalienable right" to return and the government should not try to block him. Saudi intelligence chief Muqrin bin Abdul Aziz and al-Hariri's son, Saad, met Musharraf in Islamabad on Saturday. "We are hoping, we are really hoping, sincerely hoping, His Excellency Nawaz Sharif honours this agreement," Muqrin told reporters. He cited concern about Pakistani stability. The government has not said what it will do if and when Sharif and his politician brother, Shahbaz, land in Islamabad. They could be arrested -- both Sharif brothers face various charges -- or they could be put on an aircraft back out of the country, as Shahbaz was when he tried to come home in 2004. Sharif plans to lead a procession from Islamabad 300 km (200 miles) to the city of Lahore, the capital of Punjab province, his hometown and the country's political nerve centre. Musharraf's ruling party, which was cobbled together from the remnants of Sharif's party after the 1999 coup, said on Saturday the brothers should be allowed to return home freely and allowed to compete in elections. Sharif has kept his travel plans secret. Iqbal said he was booked on three different flights but declined to give details. "We hope that nothing happens because we're just planning a very peaceful homecoming for him. But if they try to obstruct people going to the airport there may be tension," Iqbal said.
