 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, Sept 9 (bdnews24.com) -- The government has granted four licences to operate fixed telephones (PSTN) for Dhaka zone, a spokesman for Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission said Sunday. RanksTel, Square Informatics and Dhaka Telecomeach has paid Tk 4 crore to provide the basic telephony services in the Capital, Narayanganj, Gazipur and Savar, BTRC spokesman Abbas Faruque told bdnews24.com. "The fourth operator, Telebarta, will get the licence once it makes the payment," he added. Each licence is valid for 20 years. The operators will also run internet services. "But no operator will be allowed to bundle the internet services and consumers will have the liberty to pick their provider to surf the Web," Faruque said. BTRC will allocate the operators radio frequencies in 450 megahertz, 800 megahertz and 1900 megahertz to provide fixed phone services using CDMA technology. But the regulator has not clarified if the fixed phone operators will be allowed to offer "limited mobility" for Dhaka Zone. The mobile phone providers have been vehemently opposing it, alleging the PSTN providers' "backdoor entry" to the mobile market. However, once activated, the providers will be the second spell of private sector entities offering fixed phone services in Dhaka city and its adjacent areas. The past Awami League government had controversially awarded the first private PSTN licence to WotldTel in August 2001. Its network was supposed to cover the city areas of Dhaka, Gazipur and Narayanganjall in Dhaka zone. But WorldTel has failed to kick off as it shareholders' got embroiled in ownership disputes and brought criminal charges against each other. WorldTel also blocked BTRC's move to allow other private entities' entry in the most lucrative segment of the country's telecoms market. As a result, the regulator had issued nationwide PSTN licences, excluding Dhaka Zone, in 2004. Two years later it won the legal battle against non-functional WorldTel in late 2006, which removed all barriers to competition. BTRC invited the existing PSTN providers to include Dhaka Zone in their network in July 2007. The licence fee was fixed at Tk 12 crore. RanksTel, Square Informatics, Dhaka Telecom and Telebarta have paid Tk 8 crore each for four zones. "So they have now paid Tk 4 crore each to get the licence for Dhaka zone," BTRC's Abbas Faruque clarified. A total of Tk 2 crore has been marked in annual fees for renewal of licences. Besides, each operator will share 2 percent of their gross revenues for the initial two years and 3 percent of gross revenues for the subsequent three years with BTRC. He said each operator has to acquire at least 10,000 customers a year in Dhaka zone and a minimum of 4,000 customers in each of the remaining zones for the first five years. "Otherwise, BTRC will slap Tk 2 crore in penalty for non-performance in Dhaka zone and Tk 1 crore for other zones each," Faruque said. State-owned Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board has nearly 500,000 customers or 50 percent of all clients in Dhaka zone. Most of the mobile phone operators' 70 percent customers are also concentrated in this area. The new entrants with fixed phone services have to face these formidable competitors to stay on. bdn
