 Strasbourg, France, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com)  The European Parliament has adopted a resolution on Bangladesh, expressing deep concern over what it said was the disproportionate response of joint forces against the student protests at Dhaka university. The resolution adopted on Sept 6 also spelled out concern over the arrest and justification for ongoing detention of Awami League president Sheikh Hasina and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, both charged with corruption. The resolution called on the Bangladesh authorities to conduct the trial in a transparent way and in line with the rule of law. The resolution asked Bangladesh authorities to allow access to all tribunals by international human-rights organisations.
