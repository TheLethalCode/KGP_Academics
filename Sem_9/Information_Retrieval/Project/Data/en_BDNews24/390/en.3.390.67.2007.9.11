 Dhaka, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com) -- A drive to free health-directorate land in Mohakhali from grabbers in the so-called Seven-Storey Slum area left about 1,000 families homeless Tuesday. The drive, led by magistrate Md Nazrul Islam Khan, took off at 10.30am and ended Tuesday evening. Khan said: "An initiative to evict the slum was taken on August 14. But after completion of all preparations, it was suspended due to floods and unavailability of police." A total of 160 policemen, including Gulshan police chief Obaidul Haque, participated in the drive led by assistant police commissioner Shihab Kaiser for Gulshan zone. The force included 40 policewomen. Police earlier on Sunday and Monday used loudspeakers urging the slum dwellers to leave the land owned by the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS). Asked why the eviction started before arranging rehabilitation of the slum dwellers despite the government deciding in principle that rehabilitation would be ensured before eviction, the magistrate said: "The government will look into the issue of rehabilitation." On whether permission was taken from the national advisory council committee on law and order, Khan said: "The members of the committee including the committee chairman (law adviser barrister Mainul Hosein) know about the matter." The local people claimed that there were about 5,000 families in the slum area, but the magistrate said there were 700 to 800 families. He said a facility called "National Institute of Health Management" would be constructed on the land after eviction. The Saudi Arabian government will provide a Tk 200 crore grant for the project, he added. bdnews24.c
