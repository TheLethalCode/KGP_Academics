 Dhaka, Sep 9 (bdnews24.com) -- Comptroller and auditor general Asif Ali Sunday called for an improvement in the quality of audits and a quicker settlement process to develop a more efficient financial management system in the country. "The age of unilateral auditing is gone. Good teamwork is now required between the auditor and auditee," said Ali at a workshop on health sector auditing at the CAG office. Ali stressed the need for a strong auditing system to develop a robust and efficient financial management system for the Bangladesh Health, Nutrition and Population Sector Programme. Suraiya Zannath Khan, senior financial management specialist at the World Bank, said: "The workshop will provide a good platform to arrive at a common understanding about key challenges in the financial management system." WB country director Xian Zhu said the bank fully supports the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare's efforts to improve the current system. "I am confident that this workshop is a good starting point towards a strengthened audit system and we remain committed to support you in your future ventures," Zhu said. Ali inaugurated the workshop titled "Health sector audit" at the CAG office. It was jointly organised by the government and the World Bank. bd
