<TITLE> Asia stocks tumble on US economic fears </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stock markets fell on Monday, with exporters hit hard as the dollar slumped to a 15-year low against a basket of major currencies on concerns the US economy may be heading into a recession. Data on Friday showing US payrolls shrank in August for the first time in four years suggested that a credit squeeze stemming from problems in the US subprime mortgage market is beginning to stifle growth in Asia's top export market. Benchmark Japanese government bond yields fell to a 19-month low following a rally in US Treasuries on growing expectations that the Federal Reserve may have to slash interest rates next week to support the economy. "A rate cut by the US Federal Reserve would certainly ease investor concerns and it is increasingly likely that it will happen. But short of that, it is hard to see what the catalyst will be for investors' nerves to be soothed," said Martin Arnold, an equities economist at CommSec in Sydney. Tokyo's Nikkei share average fell 2.1 percent to a three-week low, with major exporters such as Sony leading the market lower. T] Sentiment was further dented by news Japan's economy contracted more than expected in the second quarter, bolstering views that the Bank of Japan is unlikely to raise interest rates next week. MSCI's measure of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan was down 1. percent. The index had risen for the past three weeks, and remains more than 15 percent above a five-month trough plumbed on Aug. 17. Australian shares were down 1.7 percent, pressured as a raft of companies started trading ex-dividend, including index heavyweight BHP Billiton Ltd and AMP Ltd South Korea's benchmark index was down 2.9 percent and Singapore's Straits Times Index was 2.0 percent lower. After opening down 1.7 percent, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was off 1.1 percent at 0250 GMT, recovering some poise as blue chip Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd surged 18 percent after the government raised its shareholding in the city's bourse operator. In Tokyo, Sony was down 5.1 percent and Toyota Motor Corp was off 2.9 percent as the yen firmed against the dollar. DOLLAR SLIDES The dollar's trade-weighted index against six major currencies fell to a low of 79.826, the lowest since September 1992, before edging back up to 79.91. Against the yen the dollar fell below 113 yen. Friday's data showing US firms cut 4,000 jobs last month, the first such decline since August 2003, prompted investors to see a bigger chance the Fed will cut rates by 50 basis points next week to protect the economy from the housing market crisis. The unexpected drop in US employment figures prompted investors to further sell the dollar on Monday. "The trend in the dollar is clearly downward," said Tsutomu Soma, a senior foreign equities manager at Okasan Securities in Tokyo. Analysts believe the Fed may opt for an unusually big cut in rates from the current 5.25 percent to help restore confidence among banks that have become reluctant to lend to each other, leading to strain in money and credit markets. The Fed usually moves in 25 basis point increments, but fears about the exposure and commitments of banks to US subprime mortgages, asset-backed commercial paper and structured investment vehicles has caused money market trading to dry up. Gold which often moves in the opposite direction to the dollar, hovered near $700 per ounce, within sight of the 16-month high hit after the US payrolls report. The high price helped gold miner shares in Australia and Hong Kong buck the trend and post gains. Oil prices nudged down but held above $76 a barrel, as expectations OPEC will maintain supply curbs on Tuesday countered the weak US jobs data.
