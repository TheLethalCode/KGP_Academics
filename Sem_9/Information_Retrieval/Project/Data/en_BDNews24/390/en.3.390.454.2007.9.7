 LONDON, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - First-time buyers are starting to return to the housing market, their confidence boosted by slowing property prices, research shows. Those taking their first steps on the property ladder accounted for 40 percent of total buyers last month -- up 3 percent on the previous month and the highest proportion this year, according to Spicerhaart Financial Services. Its index, based on a sample of 1,000 mortgages arranged at its 250 estate agency branches across the UK, also shows that fixed rates remain the most popular, but a growing number of borrowers are taking out variable rate loans. Some 81 percent of the mortgages arranged were fixed rate, but variable mortgages increased for the second consecutive month, rising to 19 percent of loans in August from 14 percent in July. Products tracking the base rate were chosen by 16 percent of borrowers -- the highest percentage since this time last year -- pointing to a growing belief among homeowners that interest rates have peaked or will do soon. The findings come a day after the Bank of England kept official interest rates on hold at 5.75 percent. It has increased the cost of borrowing five times in the past year to a six-year high, and expectations of a further rise before the end of 2007 are waning amid a global credit crunch that has rattled financial markets. Steve Cox, operations director of Spicerhaart Financial Services, said; "It is encouraging to see these early signs of the first-time buyer share picking up again, as these buyers are a vital driving force in the housing market. "With property price growth finally cooling and stabilising in some areas, first time buyers appear to be confident in their financial security. "They are looking to buy before prices start to go up again." The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said earlier this week that housing affordability has deteriorated to near record lows, with homes five times more expensive for first-time buyers than in 1996. Buyers in the southeast and southwest of England have to save over 100 percent of their annual earnings for a deposit to get a foothold on the property ladder, according to its accessibility index.
