<TITLE> First goal against Iceland all important, says Torres </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MADRID, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Scoring first away to Iceland should be good enough to guarantee three points for Spain in their Euro 2008 qualifier on Saturday, Liverpool striker Fernando Torres said. "The hardest thing is to get the first goal. If we can do that we shouldn't have any problems getting the right result," Torres told daily El Pais on Friday. "Because they will be happy with a draw, and on a small pitch like theirs it will be easier for them to defend, the problem will be to get that first goal." Iceland held Spain to a goalless draw in a friendly in Reykjavik last year, and proved a tough nut to crack when they visited Spain for their qualifier in March. It took a late goal from midfielder Andres Iniesta to secure a 1-0 win for Spain in Mallorca. In-form Torres, who has netted three goals in four league appearances for his new club, is set to lead the line with Valencia striker David Villa. He said he felt revitalised after swapping Atletico Madrid for Merseyside. "At Atletico I knew that I would play, whatever. Perhaps sometimes that led to me relaxing a little," Torres added. "I know if I have a dip in Liverpool I will be out of the side. "I feel liberated, and am enjoying myself like when I first arrived at Atletico. I still have some adapting to do but the goals and the results have helped," Torres added. His Liverpool team mate Xabi Alonso is expected to start in Spain's midfield alongside Xavi, Joaquin and David Silva. Luis Aragones's side are third in Group F, a point behind Northern Ireland and three short of leaders Sweden
