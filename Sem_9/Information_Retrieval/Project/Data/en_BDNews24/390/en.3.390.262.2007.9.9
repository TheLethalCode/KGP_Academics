 Dhaka, Sept 9 (bdnews24.com)  Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury Sunday said Russia was 'very positive' to offer technical assistance to help Bangladesh build a nuclear power project in Rooppur in Pabna. Moscow was willing to export 3 lakh metric tons of wheat and 4 lakh metric tons of fertiliser to Bangladesh, he added. "The Russain authorities have indicated that they could export 3 lakh metric tons of wheat and 4 lakh metric tons of fertiliser to Bangladesh," Iftekhar said at a news briefing on the outcome of his just-concluded three-day state visit to Russia. He went to Russia on Sept 1 and returned home on Sept 7. He is the first Bangaldesh foreign minister since the Soviet Union broke apart in 1991 to have visited Russia. "We have discussed technical issues (on setting up of a nuclear power plant in Rooppur) with the Russian government. They are very positive about it," said Iftekhar. The adviser said he assured the Russian government that the country was committed to the peaceful use of the nuclear technology and there was no chance of Bangladesh using the technology for developing nuclear weapon. On boosting ties with the world's eighth largest economy, the adviser said, "We have not seen Russia for a long time". He said the consular convention treaty, first of its kind since 1991, would provide better visa service for Bangaldeshis in Russia. He said his Russian counterpart would soon visit Bangladesh. bdn
