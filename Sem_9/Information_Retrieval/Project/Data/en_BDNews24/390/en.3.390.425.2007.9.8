 Dhaka, Sept 8 (bdnews24.com)  The condition of Arafat Rahman Coco is not stable, his physician said Saturday. A medical board has been formed at BSMMU hospital's cardiology department to treat Coco, detained younger son of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia. "Coco has no cardiac problems. But he is suffering from chest pain and cough. He has some neurological problems too," Professor Sirajul Islam, who heads the medical board for Coco, told bdnews24.com by phone. "His condition isn't stable. That's why he has been kept at the coronary care unit," he said. "Coco has been brought to BSMMU hospital for better treatment," DIG (prisons) Shamsul Haider Siddiqui had earlier told bdnews24.com. Cardiac specialist Dr Manjur Mahmud saw Coco in jail Friday noon after which he was taken to hospital. Khaleda and her son Coco were arrested Monday in a corruption case filed by the Anticorruption Commission. Coco was given seven-day remand by the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka although he was sent to jail Thursday before the end of his remand period. After Coco was taken to court, his lawyers said that he had chest pains and he was suffering from heart disease. They requested that he be admitted to the National Cardiac Institute or LABAID Cardiac Hospital. The court ordered the jail authorities to take necessary arrangements in the matter. bdnews24.com
