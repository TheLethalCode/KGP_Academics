<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh all-rounder Saqib Al Hasan has been short-listed along with three other cricketers for the International Cricket Council (ICC) emerging player of the year. The ICC Thursday short-listed the previous seven- player list to four, dropping Bangladesh wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim, England Chris Tremlett and Australian Mitchell Johnson, nominess for the emerging players of the year. Now, Saqib Al Hasan will compete with Australian fast bowler Shaun Tait, New Zealander Ross Taylor and England's Ravi Bopara. It is nothing new for the Bangladeshi cricketers to be nominated in the emerging player category as the newest Test nation. Bangladesh saw late Manjarul Islam Rana, Aftab Ahmed and Shahriar Nafees nominated in the same category in the three years since the ICC introduced the award in 2004. The ICC, apex body of world cricket, Thursday revealed the short-lists for the ICC Awards 2007 with Ponting running for four awards; Yousuf and Pietersen on the list for two. Ricky Ponting, Mohammad Yousuf, Kevin Pietersen and Shivnarine Chanderpaul have all been short-listed for the top honour at the ICC Awards 2007. The four players are in the running to receive the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy as the Cricketer of the Year, to be presented at a gala function in Johannesburg, South Africa on 10 September. Ponting secured the top award last year along with the prize for being the top Test player, and this time around he is the only player to make the short-list in four categories. The Australia captain, who enjoyed another stellar 12 months in 2006/07 as his team won the ICC Champions Trophy and the ICC Cricket World Cup (the latter for an unprecedented third time) and also regained The Ashes, is in the frame for Test Player of the Year, ODI Player of the Year and Captain of the Year as well as the Cricketer of the Year awards. Pakistan's Mohammad Yousuf is potentially in line to collect two prizes, having made the short-list for Cricketer of the Year and Test Player of the Year, while Kevin Pietersen of England is also short-listed for those two awards. West Indies batsman Shivnarine Chanderpaul is the fourth player in contention to win the coveted Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy as he completes the short-list for Cricketer of the Year. The short-lists have been compiled from long-lists of nominations after votes were submitted by members of the 56-member ICC Academy. This year's ICC Awards includes eight individual prizes, including a new one for the Associate ODI Player of the Year. It also features the selection of the Test and ODI Teams of the Year and the award to the side that has adhered most to the Spirit of Cricket.
