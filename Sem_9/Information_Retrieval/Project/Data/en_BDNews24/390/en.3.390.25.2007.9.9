 Dhaka, Sept 9 (bdnews24.com)  Detained BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's lawyer quoted her as saying Sunday that the decisions of acting secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain and ASM Hannan Shah were those of the party. "Whatever decisions Khandaker Delwar Hossain, ASM Hannan Shah and other senior BNP leaders take will be counted as party decisions. There is only one BNP, no other party under its banner exists," Advocate Sanaullah Miah quoted her as saying. Miah spoke to reporters after he and another lawyer Ahmed Azam Khan took turns to meet the former prime minister in the special jail housed in the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban complex. Khan told reporters that Khaleda told them that she respected the law of the land and was confident that she would win the legal battle. She also said the corruption charges against her were not true. "Khaleda Zia requested leaders and workers of the party to have patience and also urged the countrymen to stand united. "She also expressed concern about her sons now in jail. She learned about fate of her sons in prison through newspaper reports. She is particularly worried about Tarique [Rahman's] case." Khan went to see Khaleda at 3:30pm and came out at 5pm.Miah then met her. "I gave her a copy of the first information report (FIR) of the case against her. She read the copy. I also handed her books related to clauses 106 and 109 of the [Bangladesh Penal Code] to her," Miah said. "The lawyers who are fighting Khaleda Zia's case are divided in senior and junior groups. Both groups are in constant touch with leaders of the party and based on the outcome of the discussion we would decide whether or not to appeal for her bail. "We hope to take a final decision on the matter within a week. We hope to get justice from court." bdnews2
