<TITLE> Dhoni not feeling pressure as new captain </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JOHANNESBURG, Sept 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Twenty20 World Cup is just what India need to refresh themselves after their recent tour of England, according to new captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni. "I don't think fatigue will have any impact on the team. The England tour was very tiring and exhausting but this is a World Cup and that brings excitement, freshness and confidence to the team," Dhoni told reporters on Monday. Dhoni said he would not feel under extra pressure when he leads India for the first time in the inaugural 20-over world championship, which starts on Tuesday. Regular captain Rahul Dravid and former skippers Sourav Ganguly and Sachin Tendulkar are all being rested. "I never even dreamed of playing for my country, so to captain India is a massive bonus. But I am not under any pressure because it is the team that must implement my decisions," Dhoni said. "I only make the decisions and whether they are successful or not depends on the response of the whole playing eleven. I know it is a very big challenge to be captain but success is not just about the captain. Good captains are made by good teams." India completed a gruelling four-month tour of England at the weekend, losing the last of seven one-day internationals to lose the series 4-3. They flew straight to South Africa but Dhoni said he did not believe fatigue would be a problem in the two-week tournament. India welcome several fresh players, having recalled experienced spinner Harbhajan Singh, hard-hitting all-rounders Joginder Sharma and Irfan Pathan and swashbuckling opener Virender Sehwag. Irfan's older brother Yusuf, a spin bowling all-rounder, has also earned a first call-up. "We will have quite a few fresh players just for this tournament," Dhoni said. Harbhajan and Irfan are experienced bowlers who are used to bowling in the slog overs or when there are field restrictions. The other guys have been in the Under 19s together and have been to a bunch of national camps, so gelling will not be a big matter." India face Scotland in Durban in their first match on Thursday night
