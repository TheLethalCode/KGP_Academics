 TOKYO, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A typhoon pounded Tokyo and surrounding areas on Friday, killing one man and injuring dozens of others as it snarled transport and cut power around one of the world's largest cities. A 76-year-old man was killed by a falling tree in the resort town of Karuizawa, northwest of Tokyo, local police said. Another man was reported missing near the Tama river, south of Tokyo and 43 others were injured, NHK television said. The capital's Haneda airport was crowded with people waiting for flights to resume after hundreds were cancelled on Thursday and early Friday. Some expressways were closed and trains, including high-speed bullet services, were delayed or cancelled on many lines as commuters made their way to work. More than 60,000 households were without electricity as of 6 a.m. (2100 GMT), Tokyo Electric Power said. The eye of Typhoon Fitow, whose name means "beautiful fragrant flower" in a Micronesian language, was close to the city of Ashikaga, about 80 km (50 miles) north of Tokyo as of 7 a.m. (2200 GMT Thursday), bringing with it winds gusting up to 180 km an hour, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. The storm is expected to weaken as it moves north at about 30 km (19 miles) an hour, but the agency warned of floods, high winds and rough seas as Fitow moves north towards the main island of Hokkaido. Record rainfalls were recorded in parts of western Tokyo and hundreds of households were advised to evacuate as the Tama river came close to bursting its banks, NHK said. In July, a typhoon killed three people and injured more than 70 when it hit the southern island of Kyushu and moved along the country's eastern coastline.
