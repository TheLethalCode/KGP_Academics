 Dhaka, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com)  Arafat Rahman Coco fell ill, hours after he was sent to Dhaka Central Jail, a top official said Thursday. "He is quite ill. We are taking special care of him," inspector general (prisons) Zakir Hassan told bdnews24.com Thursday night. Two hours earlier, deputy inspector general (prisons) Shamsul Haider Siddiqui said: "As his situation is not so serious, he has been kept in Dhaka Central Jail. He is having chest pain." A magistrate's court Thursday sent Coco, the detained younger son of former prime minister Khaleda Zia, to jail even though his seven-day remand period had not ended. Coco was taken to the court of metropolitan magistrate Mohammed Salahuddin at around 1:50pm. His lawyers appealed for his proper treatment as he was suffering from chest pain and heart disease. They said he needed to be admitted to the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases or LabAid Cardiac Hospital for proper treatment. The attorneys also sought his division in the jail on the grounds that his elder brother Tarique Rahman had been given division in jail following a High Court order. bd
