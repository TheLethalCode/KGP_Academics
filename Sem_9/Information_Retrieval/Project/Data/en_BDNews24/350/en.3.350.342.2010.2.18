 Dhaka, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com)A joint working group in Dhaka discussed the progress of initiatives for power import from India on Thursday, an official said. A six-strong delegation of the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL) attended a meeting with top officials of Bangladesh Power Grid Company Limited, the PGCL's general manager Nazim Uddin told bdnews24.com. The first meeting of the working group was also attended by a joint secretary of power of Bangladesh and the chairman and managing director of PGCIL, which responsible for inter-state transmission of electricity in India. Both sides shared experiences on the progress of the initiative, taken during the visit of prime minister Sheikh Hasina to India in January, the official added. India and Bangladesh signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for cooperation in power sector during the visit. Thursday's meeting was preparatory to the second meeting of the Joint Steering Committee for Cooperation in the Power Sector on Friday. India's power secretary HS Brahma and Bangladesh counterpart Md Abul Kalam Azad will lead the two sides. The meet is likely to focus on grid inter-connection and cooperation between Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) and India's National Thermal Power Cooperation (NTPC), officials of both sides have said. Since India has agreed to provide Bangladesh with 250MW from its central grid in the initial stage, grid inter-connectivity is likely to top the agenda of the meeting in Dhaka. Brahma said that the Joint Technical Team of Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL), the BPDB and the Power Grid Company of Bangladesh (PGCB) had estimated that an investment of approximately Rs 869.21 crore (approx. Tk 1300 crore) would be required for grid inter-connection. While Rs 708.88 crore (Tk 1062 crore) of this would be required for works in Bangladesh, an investment of Rs 160.33 crore (Tk 240 crore) would be spent in India, he added. The Indian Power Secretary also said that the PGCIL would finance the works to be done in India. Sources in the Indian power ministry said that Bangladesh was keen to take the consultancy service of the PGCIL for works to be done in the country for grid interconnection. The PGCIL will associate the PGCB engineers in the works to help them gain experience. The PGCIL and PGCB may discuss the modalities of cooperation and decide on the terms during the meet in Dhaka. A technical team of the NTPC will also be a part of the delegation from India. The NTPC and BPDB are also expected to discuss the areas of cooperation and finalise the deals. In the first Joint Steering Committee's meet in Delhi on Jan 12 last, the NTPC and BPDB had agreed to prepare a feasibility report for two coal-based power projects at Khulna and Chittagong, each with generation capacity of approximately 1320 MW. The NTPC chairman and managing director RS Sharma said that that the Indian company was keen to develop one of the two projects in joint venture with the BPDB. The NTPC is also likely to carry out technical assessment for the BPDB's old thermal power stations for efficiency improvement, renovation and modernization. It may also take up operation and maintenance of some power stations in Bangladesh. bdnew
