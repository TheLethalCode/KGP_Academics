 Faridpur, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com)  Bank robbers made away with approximately Tk 1 crore by breaking into the vault of Janata Bank's Faridpur corporate branch. Officials learnt of the theft on Saturday morning after the offices opened following the overnight break-in. Police took 50 year old night watchman Paresh Das into custody for questioning. The Kotwali police chief Nur Alam Siddiqui said, "We are suspecting that someone at the bank is involved with the robbery. Otherwise such a theft is impossible." The bank's assistant manager Shah Md Assadullah said that Paresh informed them of the robbery over phone around 8:30am on Saturday. The assistant manager said he rushed to the bank and seeing the vault door broken called the police. The bank authorities have also been informed, he said. Assadullah said that initial estimates indicate that the robbers made away with around Tk 94 lakh. The safety grill of a window on the western side of the building was found open. Officials are assuming that the robbers entered through that window. A case is underway, officials said. bdn
