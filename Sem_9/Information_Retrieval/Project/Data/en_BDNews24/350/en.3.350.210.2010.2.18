<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com)BNP has demanded an investigation into what they termed a "premeditated police attack" on a protest procession of the main opposition party on Thursday. Police arrested six BNP activists from a post-rally procession at Bijoynagar in the capital as the protestors clashed with law enforcers earlier in the day. "Police attacked our peaceful procession from behind. We think the attack was pre-planned," BNP senior joint secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said at a press conference at the party's Naya Paltan headquarters immediately after the events. Paltan police chief Mojibur Rahman had earlier said they were forced to baton-charge the protestors to scatter some "unruly" activists who went on a "rampage" and damaged several vehicles on the road. Police eventually dispersed the demonstrators following 30 minutes of 'chase and counter chase'. President of pro-BNP Shechchhasebak Dal, Habibun Nabi Khan Sohel, also told bdnews24.com, "Police attacked our peaceful procession as we were returning from the Muktangan rally." A rally was held earlier in the capital's Muktangan area as part of BNP's countrywide demonstrations on Thursday against the recent cabinet decision of renaming Zia International Airport among other "repressive measures against the opposition". The airport was renamed Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Feb 15. BNP has said the renaming is a "conspiracy to wipe out Ziaur Rahman's name from the country". Khandaker Mosarraf Hossain, BNP standing committee member, also the chief guest of the rally, said, "The government is trying to wipe out Ziaur Rahman's name because they are afraid of him. The people of the country are against the government's activities." He accused Sheikh Mujibur Rahman of establishing a one-party ruling system in the country in 1975. "Awami League fears Ziaur Rahman because it was Zia who brought back multi-party democracy to Bangladesh," the BNP leader claimed. Dhaka mayor Sadek Hossain Khoka, warning the government over its "offensive activities", said the government itself was to blame for bringing BNP onto the streets. The opposition also announced a 'Grand Rally' at Paltan in March, though it did not specify any date. Mirza Alamgir said, "BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia will declare the next BNP agenda from that assembly." BNP leaders also declared a month-long countrywide programme that includes demonstrations at all upazilas on Feb 23, as well as the six divisional districts and a month-long "mass campaign". bdnew
