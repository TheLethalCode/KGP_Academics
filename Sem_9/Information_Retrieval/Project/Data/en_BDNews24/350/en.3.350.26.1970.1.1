A fourth double-fault gave Williams a break for 1-0 in the second set but Peer broke to level at 2-2 and then dug deep to fend off five break points in a nine-deuce game to hold for 3-2. Even though her reprieve was short, with Williams breaking again to lead 4-3, Peer held five break points to recover the break before Williams held for 5-3. Peer continued to battle to the end, denying Williams three match points before a netted backhand on the fourth ended the contest.
