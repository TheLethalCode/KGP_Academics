 Dhaka, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com)  BNP will hold a rally in Dhaka on Feb 22 in protest against Thursday's "police attack" on its protest procession. Senior joint secretary general of the main opposition party Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir announced the programme, to be held in front of party's Naya Paltan office at 3 pm, at a press briefing on Friday morning. Police baton-charged a BNP protest procession at Bijoynagar in the capital and arrested several activists on Thursday. Alamgir said: We'll go for tougher movement if the government interrupts our peaceful and democratic protest programmes." "They're compelling us to come down on the street. They're doing that to divert the attention of the people from price spirals, law and order deterioration, and anti-state agreements signed with India," he said. Earlier on Thursday, the party announced a grand rally at Paltan Maidan in March, protest rally at upazila and municipality level on Feb 23, and public relations throughout March. Alamgir said police arrested at least 13 of their activists from the Thursday's procession. He demanded their immediate release. Paltan police, however, said they rounded up six BNP activists as they clashed with the law enforcers, went on a "rampage" and damaged several vehicles on the road. The BNP leader said: "The government is plotting to reinforce Baksal rule under the cover of democracy. They don't want democratic environment prevail in the country." Party joint secretaries general Salahuddin Ahmed and Barkatullah Bulu, treasurer Abdul Mannan and office secretary Rizvi Ahmed were present at the press briefing held at its Naya Paltan
