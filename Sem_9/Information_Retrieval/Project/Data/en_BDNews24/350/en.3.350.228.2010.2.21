 Jahangirnagar University, Feb 21 (bdnews24.com)  Jahangirnagar University authorities have suspended six students for a year after they were accused of attacking a Bangladesh Chhatra League leader on campus. Tofazzal Hossain Emon, a drama and dramatics student, also a Chhatra League leader of Al Beruni Hall, said he was attacked with sharp weapons at the Bishmail area of the university on Saturday night. The university authorities held an emergency meeting after the reported attack. They issued a notice after the meeting expelling JCD members Galib Imtiaz Nahid (Bangla), Sabbir Ahmed (history), Mithun (anthropology) and Sujan (physics). The other two expelled students are Chhatra League's Azibur Rahman (mathematics) and Asadul Hakim Asad (geology). The latter two are accused by Emon of being "leaders of a rebel BCL faction" and of having ties with Jamaat-e-Islami's student wing Islami Chhatra Shibir. Emon told bdnews24.com by phone, "I went to Bishmail to buy medicine. Suddenly, a group of 10-15 JCD men attacked me with sharp weapons." Emon said he was undergoing treatment at Enam Medical College Hospital at Savar. He claimed Azibur Rahman was a Shibir activist "trying to infiltrate JU's Chhatra League unit". Emon alleged: "Chhatra Dal and Shibir are in a pact to create turmoil on campus and put blame on Chhatra League." A BCL leader at the university, Nahidur Rahman Sagor, filed a case with Ashulia police on Sunday in connection with the reported attack. He named seven accused, including JCD and "rebel BCL" men at the university. Ashulia police chief Sirajul Islam only confirmed that a case was filed. He refrained from naming the accused "in the interests of investigation". However, Sagor named the seven accused to bdnews24.com. Other than the six expelled student activists, 'Sabuj', a history student, is also an accused in the case, Sagor said. JU proctor Prof Arzu Mia was not available for comment.
