 KOLKATA, India, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa batsman Hashim Amla defied India with another remarkable century in the second Test on Thursday but was unable to prevent the hosts snatching victory with nine balls remaining on the final day. Off-spinner Harbhajan Singh was the destroyer with five for 59 to give India the win they needed to square the two-Test series and retain their world number one ranking. Amla, with a masterly unbeaten 123, scored his third century in as many innings. But he was forced to watch helpless from the other end as Harbhajan dismissed last man Morne Morkel for 12 to spark jubiliant celebrations from the Indian team. Morkel lingered for 20.4 overs after Amla, who hit 114 in the first innings, had batted for over eight hours to frustrate India. The home side had three full sessions to take seven South African wickets after the tourists resumed on 115-3. India eventually won by an innings and 57 runs after South Africa had been bowled out for 290 in their second innings. South Africa were bidding for their first series victory in India in a decade after winning the opening Test in Nagpur by an innings. HARBHAJAN PRAISES AMLA "If you look at recent stats and recent records of teams that have come here not many teams have been able to push India like we have been able to push them," South Africa captain Graeme Smith told reporters. "So that is a positive for us and the credit to our character." India have lost only two Test series at home in the past decade, to South Africa in 2000 and Australia in 2004, and their loss in the opening Test in Nagpur was their first at home in two years. Harbhajan bowled 48.3 overs after only 34.1 overs had been possible on the fourth day due to rain and bad light. Pace bowler Zaheer Khan did not take the field due to a strained quadricep. "From this match, we have learnt that if we fight till the last, we will do special things," Harbhajan said. "We were all ready for the fight, knew it was a very important game for all of us. It is no fluke to be at the top." Amla became only the fifth South African to score a century in each innings of a Test following his double century which was instrumental in South Africa's first test victory. He totalled 490 runs in three innings in the brief series. "Most of the teams don't know much about conditions here, but Amla was calm throughout," Harbhajan said. "That was the key, he kept to his style, did not take chances, played cricketing shots...was the best South African bats
