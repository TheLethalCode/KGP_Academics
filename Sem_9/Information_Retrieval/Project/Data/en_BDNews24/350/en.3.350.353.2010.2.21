 Dhaka, Feb 21 (bdnews24.com)  Locals at Baghaichhari in Rangamati hill district brought forward a second bullet-ridden body on Sunday as the state minister for CHT affairs visited the area in wake of conflict, during which, locals said, the army opened fire on them. State minister Dipankar Talukder assured them that a probe into the violent clashes would be held within the week. Tribal leaders said Sunday that at least six indigenous villagers were killed by army fire during the clashes between indigenous and settler communities the day before. The body of Lakkhi Bijoy Chakma, with bullet wounds in both front and back, was brought forward by the locals during the visit of Talukder on Sunday morning. Police recovered the bullet-hit body of Bhuddhapati Chakma on Saturday. The tribals told Talukder that the army had concealed another four dead bodies. They said members of the indigenous villages were still missing. The state minister was accompanied by army officials. The indigenous people were initially agitated at the sight of the army but were reassured by Talukder. He visited different areas including Gongaram Mukh area, where scores of homes, shops and a temple were torched during the tribal-settler clashes overnight Friday and into Saturday. Talukder talked with the villagers. Responding to their demand for lifting of a Section 144 clampdown on public gatherings, the state minister said: "Necessary steps will be taken after consultation with the local administration." He said action would be taken against guilty parties "within seven days". Reports from the remote area on Saturday said settler communities at Baghaichhari had torched at least 50 indigenous houses and shops. Local authorities clamped a ban on public gatherings in Baghaichhari around midday as tensions mounted. Different accounts were received of casualties and fatalities during the clashes that first ignited on Friday night in the remote Gongaram Mukh area of Baghaichhari upazila in Rangamati hill district. A number of locals said army personnel coming on the scene Saturday morning opened fire. The tribals also claimed the settlers were the first to shoot, followed by the army. The army and the Bengali settlers, however, say the tribals initiated the gun attack. Baghaichhari police said the body of Bhuddhapati Chakma was brought to the police station with a bullet through the forehead. Rangamati DC Surendranath Chakrabarti confirmed the death. A senior local council leader named five who he said were shot dead, while a regional rights group also said the army had gunned down at least three tribals. The army would not officially confirm or deny the reports. A local army officer, wishing not to be named, confirmed the death of one person "in clashes", while an army spokesman in Dhaka said he had no knowledge of the incidents in the hill district. Rangamati superintendent of police, Mahmudul Hasan told the BBC on Saturday: "I heard that there was an exchange of fire between tribals and army." When asked why the army had fired, he replied: "There must have been some necessity for it." Baghaichhari Upazila chairman Sudarshan Chakma named the dead as: Shantashil Chakma, 27, Natun Joy Chakma, 32, Lakkhi Bijoy Chakma, 40, Litan Chakma, 25, and Bhuddhapati Chakma, 36. Long-standing animosity exists between indigenous communities and settlers in the restive region where army have been deployed for decades to battle insurgency in the hill tracts. But tensions have risen again recently with the government's move to start implementing the 1997 Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord after a long gap. Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samity (PCJSS) and United People's Democratic Front (UPDF) announced Saturday that they would blockade road and river routes in Rangamati and Khagrachhari on Monday to protest the killing of indigenous people. bdnews2
