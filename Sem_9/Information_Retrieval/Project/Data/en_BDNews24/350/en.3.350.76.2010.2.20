<TITLE> Dhaka-Delhi deal to build power grid </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 (RECASTS headline, 2nd para) Dhaka, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com)  A cross-border electricity grid will be constructed within two years, officials said Friday after a daylong meeting discussing the details of cooperation between India and Bangladesh. They signed two MoUs on cross-border grid connectivity, agreeing to install 130km of distribution lines. Power secretary Abul Kalam Azad, who led the host team to the talks in Dhaka, said that the two countries had finalised the details on the shared grid, and also reached a broad agreement on building a 1320MW coal-fired power plant. The two-unit power plant (660MW each) will be based in Khulna and cost about $1.8 billion. The connection will facilitate Bangladesh's import of 250 megawatts, enough for Mymensingh zone (demand 200MW) or Sylhet zone (198MW) or Rangpur which burns 175MW. The Indian power secretary, HS Brahma, said that his country was offering "the cheapest rates"-- varying between Rs 2 and Rs 2.5 (Tk 3-3.5). In Bangladesh, the household consumers currently pay about Tk 2.5 per kWh. India's National Thermal Power Cooperation (NTPC) and the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) signed the MoUs Friday night. "The project requires 130km grid connectivity with 85km in India and 45km in Bangladesh," Brahma said. The two secretaries led the joint committee of officials, set up after the summit meeting in Delhi last month to thrash out the modalities of power cooperation. The committee decided to call for tenders on Feb 28, and hopes to award a work order in July this year. Experts say the project will take up to 24 months to be completed. The grid costs will be shared proportionately by the two neighboursTk 1100 crore by Bangladesh and about Tk 200 crore by India. Azad, the power secretary, explained that the cost was comparatively higher for Bangladesh "as we have to set up a Hi-Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) sub-station on our side". Brahma hailed the MoUs as a good start and stressed that Bangladesh must strive to increase per capita consumption and population's access to electricity -- now at 184 kWh and 47 percent respectively. "The Indian government is keen to help," Brahma said. The Indian official said power generation in Bangladesh should be increased by 2000-3000 MW every year. Once constructed, the grid will offer more possibilities, import or export of more electricity if and when necessary, the Indian power secretary said. Power will be transmitted from India's eastern zone to reduce transmission costs, he added. On the planned Khulna plant, Azad said: "BPDB and NTPC will equally share the ownership of the plant, which will be managed by NTPC since the latter has a wide experience with coal-based plants." But he did not mention the source of coal, which he said will be imported, adding that the decision will be made by the operating company. The power plant will be run by a private company operating as an Independent Power Producer (IPP). The procurement process will be launched in July and the plant completed within 3 years, if the feasibility studies and land acquisition are done immediately, he said. BPDB will contribute 25 percent of the equity, while the rest by NTPC, he added. Citing the recent gas crisis, the secretary said, "We've to go for coal in the future. We don't have options." "There is coal in northern Bangladesh, which we must harness." OTHER AREAS OF ASSISTANCE As part of the cooperation, NTPC will also assist in human resource development to increase skills of Bangladeshi officials, Azad said. Meanwhile, NPTC will undertake technical renovation and tuning of the installed plants, which have lost generation capacity. "BPDB will prepare a list of such plants and if successful, we'll go for vigorous works, where we'll ensure discipline in financial affairs," Azad said.
