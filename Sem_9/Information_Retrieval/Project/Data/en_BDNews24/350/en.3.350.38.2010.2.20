<TEXT>
 Benapole, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com)  Export and import through Benapole land port were halted on Saturday following a feud between two labour organisations at Petrapole port on the Indian side of the border. Abdul Gafur, cargo superintendent of Benapole check post, told bdnews24.com on Saturday afternoon that no goods-laden trucks were able to cross the border since 6am. Kartik Chakravarty, general secretary of Petrapole C&F Workers Welfare Association, said two labour groups, one pro-Trinamool Congress and the other pro-Congress Party, were locked in clashes over dominance at the Indian land port. Port authorities were "negotiating solutions to the problem", Chakravarty said. "The usual activities at the port will resume immediately after we reach a solution," the port official also said. He, however, could not say how long that would be. bdne
