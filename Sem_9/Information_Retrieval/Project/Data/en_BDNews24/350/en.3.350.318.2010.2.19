 LONDON, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UEFA must improve the way they handle refereeing arrangements for major matches, a still-angry Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said on Friday. Wenger was incensed by Swedish referee Martin Hansson's decision to allow Porto a quickly-taken indirect free kick that led to their second goal in their 2-1 Champions League round-of-16, first-leg victory on Wednesday.
