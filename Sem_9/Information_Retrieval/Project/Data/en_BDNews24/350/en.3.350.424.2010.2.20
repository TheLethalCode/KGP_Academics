 Khagrachari, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com)  At least 32 houses and shops, mostly owned by tribal people, were torched at Baghaichari upazila in Rangamati district on Friday night during a clash between indigenous people and Bangali settlers in the region. Khagrachari deputy commissioner Mohammad Abdullah and Rangamati deputy commissioner Surendranath Chakrabarti said the situation in Baghaichari was "under control" on Saturday. "There was tension on Friday night, but the situation is quiet now. Law enforcers remain alert," Surendranath told bdnews24.com on Saturday morning. The two sides blamed each other for the arson attack. But local journalists said members of Parbatya Bangali Chhatra Parishad, a student organisation of Bangali settlers, beat an indigenous man at Baghaichari Bazaar during a procession in the evening, sparking the clash at night. They said 11 shops and 17 houses of tribal people, one house of a settler, the local UNDP office and a Unicef-financed education centre were torched during the clash. Dharmabir Chakma, chairman of Dighinala upazila, adjacent to Baghaichari, blamed the anti-Peace Accord settlers for the incident. "Members of Parbatya Bangali Chhatra Parishad and activists torched the houses of the tribal people in a pre-planned way," he told bdnews24.com after visiting the site. Chhatra Parishad chief Yakub, however, told bdnews24.com that tribal people were responsible for the arson attack. Road communications on Baghaichari-Sajek route remained suspended for some time after the incident. Long-standing animosity exists between indigenous communities and settlers in the region. Tensions have risen again recently with the government's moves to start implementing the 1997 Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord after a long gap. bdn
