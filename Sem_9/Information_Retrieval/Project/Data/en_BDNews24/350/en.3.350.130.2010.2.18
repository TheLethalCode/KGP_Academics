 BELGRADE, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United defender Nemanja Vidic wants to stay at the English champions next season and has never fallen out with manager Alex Ferguson, the Serbia international said. Vidic has not played for United this year due to a niggling calf injury but some newspapers in England and Serbia suggested he had fallen out with Ferguson ahead of United's FA Cup tie with Leeds United in January. "I have never had a conflict of any kind with Sir Alex Ferguson and rife speculation that I want to leave United is completely untrue," Vidic told Belgrade daily Vecernje Novosti. "I have a contract until the summer of 2012 and I have every intention of seeing it through to the very last day. "United have made me the player I am today and there is no substance whatsoever in rumours that I have been looking for a move away to either Real Madrid or AC Milan." Vidic, who has won three Premier League titles and the Champions League with United, missed their 3-2 win at Milan in the Champions League on Tuesday but hopes to be fit for the return leg at Old Trafford on March 10. "I can't wait to get back on the pitch and although I've had a long layoff, I feel strong and fit again," he said. "I think I will return to action very quickly and hopefully I will be back to my best as soon as I am picked in the starting line-up again. "We got a great result at Milan but we have to raise our game for the return leg and I am sure we can." Treble-chasing United are one point behind Chelsea in the Premier League and play Aston Villa in the League Cup final at Wembley Stadium on Feb
