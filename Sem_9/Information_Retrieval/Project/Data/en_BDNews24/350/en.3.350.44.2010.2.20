 PORT-AU-PRINCE, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two US missionaries under investigation in Haiti on child kidnapping charges will remain in jail while a Haitian judge checks their testimony that they wanted to set up an orphanage in neighbouring Dominican Republic, the judge said on Friday. Judge Bernard Sainvil said he would seek information in the Dominican Republic about Laura Silsby and Charisa Coulter, who were among 10 American missionaries arrested last month as they tried to take 33 Haitian children over the border following the devastating Jan. 12 earthquake in the Caribbean country. The group had no identity documents for the children or permission to take them out of the country. Many of the children's parents subsequently came forward to say they had turned them over voluntarily to the missionaries in the belief they would have better care in the hands of the Americans. Sainvil on Wednesday freed eight of the missionaries, most of whom are members of a Baptist church in Idaho. While the judge said he found no "criminal intentions" to support the charges of child kidnapping and criminal association against the eight, he ordered Silsby, the group's leader, and Coulter detained for further questioning. "I am going to the Dominican Republic tomorrow to learn more about the case and to visit where Mrs Silsby said she had the orphanage. I want to talk to some people there who could have useful information," Sainvil told reporters on Friday. Silsby and Coulter were members of a group calling itself the New Life Children's Refuge whose mission statement said its purpose was to "rescue Haitian orphans abandoned on the streets, in makeshift hospitals, or from collapsed orphanages in Port-au-Prince and surrounding areas" and bring them to an orphanage being established in Dominican Republic. The missionaries denied any wrongdoing in Haiti and said they just wanted to help orphans left destitute by the quake. THREE WEEKS IN JAIL Earlier on Friday, Sainvil questioned Silsby and Coulter about previous visits they had made to orphanages in Haiti. Sainvil said the two would face another hearing on Tuesday, next week and would remain in detention until them. Their Haitian lawyer said he is confident they will also be freed. The Americans were arrested on Jan. 29, 17 days after the magnitude 7 earthquake that killed at least 212,000 people. Their case has been a media distraction at a time when Haitian authorities and foreign aid groups are working to feed and care for hundreds of thousands of homeless quake victims sheltering in makeshift camps scattered across the ruined capital Port-au-Prince. Asked about Friday's questioning by the judge, Silsby told Reuters: "He asked me questions about a visit I made to an orphanage in Ouanaminthe in December 2009. I went there and I met Pastor Daniel (in charge), we distributed gifts to the children." She looked tired and pale after three weeks in jail. The New Life Children's Refuge's mission statement, which lists Silsby as executive director and founder, said the group was buying land to build an orphanage, school and church in Magante on the north coast of the Dominican Republic. But in the meantime it had planned to lease a 45-room hotel and convert it into a temporary orphanage at nearby Cabarete, according to the mission statement document. Port-au-Prince's chief prosecutor, Joseph Manes Louis, said he would accompany the judge on the investigation trip to Dominican Republic. Louis said he had learned, in a separate case, of another location in the Dominican Republic to where some 200 Haitian children had been taken, and he would investigate that too. Following last month's catastrophic quake, Haiti's government and child protection groups said they had received reports that orphans and other children were being taken out of the country illegally by suspected human trafficke
