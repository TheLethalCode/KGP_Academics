<TITLE> Airport renaming, a 'lesson' for BNP </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com)  It was actually to teach the main opposition BNP a lesson that Dhaka's international airport was renamed, says the prime minister. "They needed to be taught a lesson," Sheikh Hasina said on Friday, speaking at a programme to mark the 21st February, the International Mother Language Day, in a clear reference to her tit-for-tat move to strip the nation's top airport of Ziaur Rahman's name. On Monday, the cabinet decided to rename the airport after the 14th century Muslim saint Hazrat Shahjalal. Hasina was speaking at the recently renamed Bangabandhu International Convention Centre, the erstwhile Bangladesh China Friendship Convention Centre, and said that the BNP had also renamed the convention centre. "They should have learned from history and seriously considered what might happen after they went out of power," she said, referring to the BNP which led an alliance government with Jamaat during 2001-2006. "They had changed about 200 to 250 names during their tenure, but now that we are in power, only one or two seem to have become a major issue." The BNP has already protested against renaming the international airport on Thursday. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina came down heavily on the opposition accusing them of sympathising with the murderers of her father, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding president of Bangladesh. Without mentioning name, Hasina referred to Khaleda's claim that her birthday was on August 15, which happens to be the same day as Hasina's father and most members of the family were murdered. "Some people change their birthdays to August 15 to encourage murderers." "One of the murderers was promoted in the foreign ministry during their regime even when their trial was in progress." Hasina then referred to the opposition 'reaction' after the execution of five of those guilty of Bangabandhu's murder and said, "Having failed to save the murderers they remained silent after the executions." "They are still quiet only in fear that it would not have popular support." She said that such people could only plan attacks like those of Aug 21 and the murders. On August 21 of 2004, a grenade attack on a rally of Awami League, then in the opposition, killed some 24 people including Ivy Rahman, the current president's wife. Hasina said although there was a bumper production and stocks were sufficient, prices kept increasing because of the collusion and manipulation of certain quarters that were out to discredit the government.
