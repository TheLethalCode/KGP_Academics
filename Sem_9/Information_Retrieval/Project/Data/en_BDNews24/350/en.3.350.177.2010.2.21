 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Feb 21 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh's centuries-old elephant trails, the natural pathways made and used by the Asian pachyderms, are being gradually whittled away as humans encroach across them. As these unique animals suffer their foraging grounds to shrink too, elephant attacks on humans become more frequent, which in turn further threatens the endangered mammal's dwindling numbers. At present the number of elephants stands at between 250-350 in 11 forests of the country, forest conservator (wildlife and nature conservation circle) Tapan Kumar Dey says. Another 80-100 elephants move across the borders from Myanmar's Arakan and India's Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Tripura states. There are another 90-100 captive elephants in zoos and circuses. Dey says elephants have suffered serious loss of habitation because of human encroachment inside the forest over the last few decades. Loss of their long-used trails also disorients the animals. "The elephant trails are being wiped out by human habitation and road construction, leading to a crisis of their food and water," Dey told bdnews24.com. In Chittagong, Khagrachhari, Cox's Bazar, Bandarban, Mymensingh and Sylhet the age-old trails have drastically shrunk. The forests of Mymensingh, Sylhet, Chittagong and the hill tracts were all elephant sanctuaries once upon a time. Now these endangered mammals are found wild only in the forests of Chittagong and the hill districts. Even here, their habitat is fast disappearing. Three major elephant trailstwo extending from Chunti-Naikkhongchhari and Rangunia-Rajstholi in Chittagong's southern forests and another ranging from Teknaf-Cox's Bazar-Naikkhongchhari in the north of Cox's Bazarwere once well-trodden by the animals all year round. But elephants can no longer roam freely along these once-familiar tracks due spread of local habitations, establishment of Rohingya camps, construction of Chittagong-Cox's Bazar highway, and 24-hour vehicular movement in the region. "The sanctuary of our elephants is shrinking day by day. Attack of wild elephants has increased because they are losing their habitats and natural trails," Ainun Nishat, adviser of International Union for Conservation Nature, told bdnews24.com. "The tracks that elephants used for foraging, passing through them five times a year on average, are now being taken up by humans. Now, the elephants are seen on these trails just once a year," said Nishat. CONSERVATION EFFORTS Environment and forest secretary Mihir Kanti Majumdar has said the government is acting to conserve forests and natural habitats to protect wildlife. "Initiatives are being taken to amend environmental, conservation and wildlife laws," Majumdar told bdnews24.com. Plans have also been taken to deal with wild animal attacks, he said. A father and son were killed most recently in an elephant attack in December last year in Bandarban. Three people were killed in Teknaf just months before that. A policy will be formed to protect elephants and also to compensate those who have suffered losses, Majumdar said. Conserving forests, planting trees for elephant food, following the wildlife act and increasing public awareness can help counter elephant attacks, suggested Anwarul Islam, executive chairman of Bangladesh Wildlife Trust. 'ACTION RESEARCH' A project called 'Action research for conservation of Asian elephants in Bangladesh', started in 2001 with the assistance of US Fish and Wildlife Service. Its first phase was successfully launched up to 2003, which created much awareness of conservation issues. Nishat said there were plans to launch the second phase. In the meantime, a monitoring cell should be formed at the forest department especially to tackle elephant attack situations, said the IUCN adviser. They could form groups to drive away elephants from human settlements. This would include training and equipping officials and locals for taking proper steps during attack, he said. According to IUCN, there are around 35,000 to 50,000 elephants in 13 countries worldwide. Around half of them live on the Indian subcontinent. bd
