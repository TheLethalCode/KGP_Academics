 Khagrachari, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com)  Local authorities imposed a Section 144 ban on public gatherings at Baghaichari upazila in Rangamati on Saturday as tensions mounted following clashes between indigenous people and Bangali settlers during which at least 50 houses and shops were torched. Indigenous people also said at least four of their community were killed when army opened fire on them, a claim that could not be immediately confirmed from the remote upazila of the hill district. Different accounts were received of casualties and fatalities during the clashes that ignited on Friday night. Earlier Saturday morning, deputy commissioners of Rangamati and neighbouring Khagrachari, Surendranath Chakrabarti and Mohammad Abdullah, told bdnews24.com that the situation in Baghaichari was "under control". "There was a tension on Friday night, but the situation is quiet now. Law enforcers remain alert," Surendranath had told bdnews24.com. However, the situation flared up again. A number of locals said army personnel coming on the scene midday Saturday opened fire on them. Rangamati district PCJSS general secretary of Bodhisatwa Chakma and Baghaichari upazila chairman Sudarshan Chakma told bdnews24.com at least four indigenous people were killed by the firing. But army personnel said tribal people fired shots first at them as they arrived. Settlers also claimed the indigenous people shot at them. An army official, wishing not to be named, confirmed the death of one person "in the clashes". Baghaichari upazila nirbahi officer SM Humayun Kabir, the local administrative head, told bdnews24.com that they eventually imposed the Section 144 to bring a tense situation under control. Long-standing animosity exists between indigenous communities and settlers in the region. Army have been deployed for decades in the restive region. But tensions have risen again recently with the government's moves to start implementing the 1997 Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord after a long gap. At least 30 houses and shops, mostly owned by tribal people, were torched at Baghaichari on Friday night during the initial clash between the indigenous people and Bangali settlers in the area. Local journalists said members of Parbatya Bangali Chhatra Parishad, a student organisation of Bangali settlers, beat an indigenous man at Baghaichari Bazaar during a procession in the evening, sparking the clash at night. The two groups clashed again on Saturday morning, when at least 20 houses at Hajachara, Guccha Gram, Balughat, Simanachara, Baipaichara, Suranganala and Kerekkaba villages were torched. The two sides blamed each other for the arson. Dharmabir Chakma, chairman of Dighinala upazila, adjacent to Baghaichari, said "anti-Peace Accord settlers" were responsible. "Members of Parbatya Bangali Chhatra Parishad and other such activists torched the houses of the tribal people in a pre-planned way," he told bdnews24.com after visiting the site. Chhatra Parishad chief Yakub, however, told bdnews24.com that the tribal people made the arson attack. Road communications on Baghaichari-Sajek route remained suspended for some time after the incident. Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samiti (PCJSS) and United People's Democratic Front (UPDF) also made a joint announcement that they would blockade road and river routes in Rangamati and Khagrachari on Monday in protest against the killing of indigenous people. bdn
