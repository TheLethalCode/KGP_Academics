<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com)  The Water Development Board has been instructed to complete the formalities for repairing the cyclone-damaged coastal embankments by next week. The embankments are yet to be repaired even nine months after the devastating cyclone Aila battered the country's southwest coast in mid-2009. "If the Water Development Board fails to complete the task in a week we will start it along with the local people and the army," food and disaster management minister Abdur Razzak told a workshop, organised by Brac and Bela, on Thursday. Some 48,000 families have taken shelter on the embankments and in cyclone centres since Aila destroyed their homes. Razzak acknowledged that the government could not rehabilitate all the affected people. The instruction to hasten the repair work comes amid growing concern that unless the task is completed before the onset of the monsoon it would put hundreds of thousands of homeless people in further jeopardy. Sharafat Hossain Khan, executive engineer of WDB, said some 37 polders on the 5,100 km areas of embankment were severely damaged, of them 32 were repaired. The tender process has been finalised and the remaining repair work would be completed by next month. The workshop also invited a number of people from the battered region of Satkhira and Khulna. They demanded completion of the work before the rainy season. Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers' Association chief executive Syeda Rizwana Hasan said if the repair work cannot be finished by March people will have to stay in the shelters or on the embankments for another 10 months. She alleged that the relief being provided to victims are insufficient, demanding that proper actions must be taken to address the problem. The minister said the refugees would be sent back home after the repair of the embankments. He said each family would be given two bundles of corrugated iron sheets and Tk 10,000-15,000 to rebuild their houses. The government has sought about Tk 11,000 crore from the donors to build infrastructures and rehabilitate the affected people. In addition, Japan has already initiated to install water purifying plants at a cost of Tk 105 crore that will be completed within two months. bdn
