Twenty20 world champions Pakistan elected to bat after winning the toss but could only manage a total of 129 for eight, Shoaib Malik top-scoring with 33.

Morgan and Pietersen then shared an unbroken partnership of 112 to steer Collingwood's men to victory with nine balls to spare. Dubai will also host Saturday's second match
