<TEXT>
 Hobiganj, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com)  A Hobiganj court on Thursday sent former BNP state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar back to jail after a six-day remand for interrogation in connection with the Shah AMS Kibria murder case. Chief judicial magistrate Rajeeb Kumar Biswas ordered Babar back behind bars after he was produced before the court in the morning and fixed Feb 22 for a hearing on a petition by Babar's lawyers seeking time out for his medical treatment. Babar is currently serving a sentence of 17 years in an arms case. On Feb 2, he was shown arrested in connection with the Jan 27, 2005 grenade attack in Habiganj that killed Kibria and four others. On Feb 11, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) remanded Babar for six days to interrogate him in connection with the grenade attack. CID senior assistant police superintendent Rafiqul Islam, also the investigation officer of the Kibria murder case, told reporters that they are scrutinising the information Babar gave them. Babar has also been shown arrested in connection with the August 21, 2004 grenade attack on an Awami League rally when he was state minister. Apart from Babar, seven others including Harkatul Jihad leaders Mufti Abdul Hannan and Badrul Alam Mizan are also behind the bars in the 2004 grenade attack case. State counsels have said Mufti Hannan, in a confessional statement, gave evidence that Babar was also linked to the Kibria murder case. Public prosecutor Akbar Hossain Jitu has also claimed that Babar had 'confessed' his connection with the 2002 grenade attack that killed Kibria, while being interrogated in the 2004 grenade case. bdnew
