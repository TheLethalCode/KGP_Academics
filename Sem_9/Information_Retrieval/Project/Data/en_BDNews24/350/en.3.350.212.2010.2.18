 Dhaka, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com)-- The government must clarify what the World Bank's role would be in the management of country's Multi Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) for Climate Change, a rights body demanded on Thursday. Equity BD, a network of 19 rights groups, at a press conference Thursday criticized the role of development partners as they have been consistently pushing Bangladesh to accept the World Bank to manage the multi donor trust fund. It termed the approach "'colonial" Since the establishment of MDTF in September 2008, major contributors to this fund including the UK and other EU countries, have been pressing the government to channel the fund through the World Bank, Equity BD secretary general Mohammad Samsuddoha said in a written statement. "There has been a lot of debate in the recent BDF meeting over the inclusion of the Bank in the proposed climate fund." BDF, or the Bangladesh Development Forum, held a two-day meeting between the government and donors on Feb 15-16. At the conclusion of the BDF meeting, the finance minister said that the government would pay 1 percent of the MDTF fund to the World Bank as it would take technical and fiduciary assistance from the multilateral lending agency, the rights group claimed. Although the amount seems negligible, the Equity BD claimed that past experience showed the Bank and the donors would eventually take full control of the fund under the guise of technical assistance. In an effort to allay any concern about the donors' eventual control of the fund, AMA Muhith told the media Tuesday that there was no concession on the overall administration of the fund, which would be done essentially by the environment ministry. He, however, mentioned that the government had sought technical assistance from the World Bank but declined to elaborate on the nature of the assistance, saying that the details had still not been worked out. "The responsibilities will be eventually taken over by the government in a few years," he said while briefing the media after the BDF's technical session on climate change
