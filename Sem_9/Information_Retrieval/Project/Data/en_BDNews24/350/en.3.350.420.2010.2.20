 LONDON, 19 Feb (Bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news ahead of this weekend's matches in the Premier League: Arsenal's injury crisis could be eased a little for the home match with Sunderland on Saturday (1500) if first choice goalkeeper Manuel Almunia comes through a fitness test on his injured finger. He would replace Lukasz Fabianski, blamed for both goals in Arsenal's 2-1 defeat at Porto in the Champions League on Wednesday. Arsenal will still be without William Gallas and Abou Diaby, although Alex Song could return after a knee injury. Sol Campbell who scored on his return to Champions League action after a four-year absence, could keep his place in the heart of defence. Leaders Chelsea welcome back John Terry for Saturday's match at Wolverhampton Wanderers (1500) after the captain missed last week's FA Cup win over Cardiff City for personal reasons. However, the Londoners will be without vice-captain Frank Lampard because of a virus and Michael Essien, Jose Bosingwa, Ashley Cole, Juliano Belletti, Deco and Alex through injury. Second-placed Manchester United will be without Ryan Giggs (broken arm) for their visit to Everton on Saturday (1245) where Wayne Rooney will be keen to add to his season's tally of 25 goals against the club where he began his career. Nani and Rio Ferdinand are suspended. However Nemanja Vidic could return after being sidelined with a nerve problem in his leg while Antonio Valencia is expected to start. Everton have been ravaged by injuries all season, and while Mikel Arteta is back and regaining his fitness in midfield, Tim Cahill could be out after injuring a calf in their 2-1 win over Sporting in the Europa League on Tuesday. Everton will also be missing influential midfielder Marouane Fellaini, out for the rest of the season with an ankle injury. Fourth-placed Manchester City will be without the suspended Patrick Vieira for Liverpool's visit to Eastlands on Sunday (1500). City are also likely to be without Carlos Tevez who is still in Argentina because of family matters while winger Martin Petrov is out injured. Liverpool have Yossi Benayoun back in contention after the Israeli missed the last month with a broken rib but striker Fernando Torres and full back Glen Johnson (both knee) will be given more time to recover. "Yossi is training with the team. He still has a problem with his rib but at least he is training," Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez said. "Torres and Johnson are progressing and working with the fitness coach. They are very close but not available yet." On Sunday, sixth-placed Tottenham play at Wigan Athletic (1615), who they thumped 9-1 in November, with Aaron Lennon still not certain to return after missing the last 10 matches with a groin injury. However, Russian striker Roman Pavyluchenko is expected to make an appearance after recovering from a groin injury. Aston Villa, in seventh place and playing Burnley at home on Sunday (1400), hope to have strikers Gabriel Agbonlahor and Emile Heskey fit for the match. Agbonlahor missed last week's FA Cup match at Crystal Palace while Heskey came off with an injury at halftime
