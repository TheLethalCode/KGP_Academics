Keeping in view the forthcoming Muktijoddha Sangsad polls, Ujjal Vikash Dutta, the secretary of the ministry said, it has decided to bring out a list of the genuine freedom fighters by March 14. "With a view to enlisting all those who fought the liberation war and to weed out the non-freedom fighters, all upazilas now have selection committees and every district, an appeal committee for the purpose," said the state minister replying to an MP's query. The committees have been formed after the present government came to power, the minister said. As per the official gazettes, a total 2,339 freedom fighters embraced martyrdom in the 1971 war of liberation, he said.

Conferring special honours Replying to a query raised by the AL MP Nasimul Alam Chowdhury, the minister said, the ministry has not yet taken steps about conferring six US citizens Bangladesh citizenship for their contribution during the liberation war. He said the matter was under process and an inter-ministerial meeting already discussed the issues related to conferring honours upon foreign citizens of different countries including the US for their contribution during the war. Graveyards-Memorials Answering another question raised by Bagerhat-2 MP Mir Shawkat Ali Badshah, the minister said the government has plans to erect memorials over 339 burial sites of freedom fighters across the country. Replying to Natore-3 MP Junaid Ahmed Palak, he said the AL government also plans to start work on the construction of a glass war memorial as well as 14 war memorials in 10 districts where the freedom fighters had engaged in face to face battles in 1971. bdne
