 bdnews24.com New Delhi Correspondent New Delhi, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com)  If a Bangladesh national is planning to attend an international conference or seminar or workshop in India, he or she should seek visa well in advance to avoid missing the event. A tighter visa procedure has been imposed on citizens of Bangladesh and seven other countries, and they will get visas only after the home ministry in New Delhi issues the security clearance for them. The Indian home ministry has issued new instructions to all central ministries and departments as well as the chief secretaries of the governments of all its states and union territories to strictly adhere to the revised procedure for granting Conference Visas to foreign participants in international meets. "The security clearance for grant of Conference Visa will be required from the Ministry of Home Affairs only in case of participants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Sudan as well as for stateless persons and in case of citizens of any country with origin in Pakistan," home ministry spokesperson Onkar Kedia said. "The participants from other countries could obtain Conference Visa from the Indian Embassies, High Commissions and Consulates on production of the invitation letters from the organizers of the events as well as clearances from the Ministry of Home Affairs to hold the meets, administrative approvals of the respective nodal ministries of the Union Government, political clearances from the Ministry of External Affairs and clearances from the respective Governments of the States and Union Territories," said Kedia, additional director general at the ministry. He added that the fresh instructions had been issued to ensure that all organizers of such international events strictly adhere to the time line for submitting their proposals to the home ministry at least six weeks before the event. "This would ensure that security clearance for the event and for the participants could be suitably assessed. Security vetting is a time-consuming process and most of the organisers of international events have not been strictly adhering to the prescribed time schedules," added Kedia. The Indian government had earlier on July 15 last year revised the procedures for grant of conference visa to foreign citizens. "But the revised procedures were not being implemented properly across the country," an official said. From now, the Foreigners Division of the home ministry will grant "in-principle approval" for holding international conferences, seminars or similar events.
