 LONDON (Reuters) - Britain urged Israel on Thursday to cooperate fully with its investigation into the apparent use of faked British passports by assassins suspected of killing a Hamas militant commander in Dubai last month. Israeli ambassador to London Ron Prosor met the head of Britain's diplomatic service, Peter Ricketts, after being called to a meeting at the Foreign Office.
