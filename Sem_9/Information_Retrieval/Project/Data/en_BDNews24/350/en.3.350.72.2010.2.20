<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com)  BNP has urged prime minister Sheikh Hasina to take lessons from her own party's history instead of "giving lessons" to the opposition. BNP standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain made the comment Saturday countering a statement made by the prime minister the previous day. Hasina, addressing a programme at the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre on Friday, said that the recent decision to change the name of Zia International Airport was changed "to teach BNP a lesson". Mosharraf replied on Saturday: "We are politely telling the prime minister to not worry about our lessons but to learn from her own party Awami League's history and run the country. Or else the people will reject the government in the future and teach them a lesson instead." The BNP leader was addressing a party programme on the eve of International Mother's Language Day at the capital's IEB auditorium. Mosharraf referred to the regime of Hasina's father and Bangladesh's founding father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. "Your father, with his the Rakkhi Bahini, murdered freedom fighters who differed from him to 'teach them a lesson'." "When he could not stop opposition through black laws, he established one-party rule. The people taught a lesson to Awami League for all this." Mosharraf also claimed that AL was "frightened" of late president and BNP's de facto founder Ziaur Rahman and that was why the ruling party was erasing his name from establishments countrywide. Fellow standing committee member MK Anwar voiced the same sentiment. "The name change was meant to 'give us a lesson'. We want to say that, in the future, it will not be us who will be giving them a lesson, it will be the people." The party's vice president Shah Moazzem Hossain, meanwhile, said, "I say to the government, make a new establishment and then give it a name. He severely criticised the government party's student-wing Chhatra League's criminal activities, including terrorism, extortion and tender-manipulation, and warned the prime minister, "They have become like Frankenstein. Stop them or they will break your neck." The vice president also accused Awami League of grossly manipulating the history of the Language Movement of 1952. Standing committee members Goyeshwar Chandra Roy and Nazrul Islam Khan spoke amongst others at the programme conducted by opposition whip Joynul Abdin Farroque. b
