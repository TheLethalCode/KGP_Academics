<TITLE> ElBaradei lands in Egypt, backers want presidency bid </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CAIRO, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former UN nuclear chief Mohamed ElBaradei arrived at Cairo airport on Friday to an exuberant welcome from supporters who hope he will stir up Egyptian politics by running for president in 2011. Security men hustled away ElBaradei, tipped as a possible consensus candidate, as crowds surged forward, chanting "Yes, to ElBaradei ... Justice and freedom to Egyptians." ElBaradei later reappeared in a Jeep to meet his supporters, numbering about a thousand, but had to drive past without stopping as the overenthusiastic crowd became unruly. His supporters, including members of the Kefaya and the Sixth of April Youth movements who oppose the government of President Hosni Mubarak, sang Egypt's national anthem and waved flags before ElBaradei landed several hours late. However, among the crowds were also people who said they did not belong to any group, including children as young as 10 and elderly Egyptians. "Most of those who came out do not belong to the traditional political parties but are very normal Egyptian citizens who came out," novelist Alaa Al Aswany told Reuters at the airport. "This is a very important moment that will usher in an era of positive change for Egypt." A move by ElBaradei, the 67-year-old former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, could signal that he wants to use his international stature to press for democratic reforms in his home country, ruled by Mubarak for nearly three decades. ElBaradei stepped down last year as IAEA chief after building an international reputation, most recently for his handling of Iran's nuclear programme which Tehran says is peaceful but the West fears is to build weapons. ElBaradei has said he would consider running for president but wants first a new constitution with checks on power, guarantees of a fair vote and better respect for human rights. "What ElBaradei calls for is not impossible, and there is no obstacle to achieve it other than the government and its stubbornness against change," lawyer Mahmoud El-Khoudairy told Reuters before ElBaradei's arrival. But any presidential bid faces a huge challenge in the most populous Arab country as rules make it almost impossible for anyone to succeed without the backing of Mubarak's ruling National Democratic Party, which dominates parliament. The Islamic Brotherhood currently forms the main opposition bloc but it is officially banned and some of its top officials are standing trial, accused of militancy. INSTRUMENT OF CHANGE ElBaradei did not speak at the airport, but was quoted before arriving as saying he wanted to be "an instrument of change" and that the presidency was not his main goal. "The presidency does not concern me as much as the process of change, which does not depend on one person but on the entire nation," he told al-Masry al-Youm daily newspaper on Friday. Mubarak, 81, has not said if he plans to run in 2011 but most Egyptians speculate that if he bows out he will seek to hand power to his son Gamal, 46. Both men deny any such plans. Under Egypt's election rules, ElBaradei would realistically have to hold a leadership post for at least a year in a political party represented in parliament to be eligible to run. Egyptian media have speculated that opposition parties might court ElBaradei, hoping he could join the leadership of their parties in time to ensure eligibility. Among ElBaradei's conditions for running are judicial supervision of the election carried out under the watchful eye of United Nations monitors. He also wants state media to give equal space to the platforms of all candidates. "The issue is not ElBaradei as president but amending the constitution to ensure that we have free elections with serious challengers, not only with the choice of either Mubarak or his son Gamal," Aswany said. Egypt experimented with its first multi-candidate presidential election in 2005 that it touted as a process of democratisation, but which critics panned as a sh
