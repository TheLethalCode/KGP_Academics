 Dhaka, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com)  Rajuk on Thursday resumed demolition of the unauthorised storeys of Jamuna Future Park in Dhaka after the developer's appeal was rejected by the Supreme Court. Workers of the Rajdhani Unnayan Kortripokkho, the city development authority, began demolishing the top four floors of the sprawling complex at Bashundhara from 10am in presence of police. Rajuk's magistrate Md Rokonuddowla, who was overseeing the demolition work, told bdnews24.com: "Since the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal by Jamuna Builders there is no bar for Rajuk to knock down the unapproved parts of the Future Park." Nurul Amin, Gulshan zone assistant police commissioner, said that Jamuna authorities claimed that they had filed another petition but could not show any documents. "So the work is going on," he said. The Future Park authorities had permission to build up to six floors, but in some parts they erected 10 storeys without permission. Rajuk had originally issued a demolition notice on January 17, asking the Jamuna Future Park authorities to knock down the unauthorised top four floors within seven days. Jamuna Group immediately petitioned the High Court, challenging the Rajuk notice, but the court dismissed the petition on Feb 3. Rajuk itself began demolishing the unapproved floors of the building the following day. But the demolition work came to a halt as Jamuna Builders immediately sought to appeal against the High Court's dismissal of the earlier petition. The Supreme Court on Feb 11 dismissed the appeal. Jamuna Group chairman Nurul Islam Babul urged Rajuk on Wednesday to complete all legal procedures before knocking down the additional structures. Jamuna says the Future Park development will be the largest shopping mall and entertainment complex in South Asia once complete.
