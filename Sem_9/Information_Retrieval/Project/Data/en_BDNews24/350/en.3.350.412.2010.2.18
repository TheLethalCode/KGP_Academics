 Dhaka, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com)  Shops across the country must be shut after 8pm to ensure uninterrupted power supply to farmers for irrigation until the end of the Boro season, the state minister for power said on Thursday. Enamul Haque told reporters after an inter-ministerial meeting that power supply authorities in urban areas would also go for load management to contribute to the initiative. The farmers would get uninterrupted power from 11pm to 5am for irrigation of Boro crops up to March, except during the ongoing SSC examinations, when power for irrigation would be supplied from midnight to 5am. The minister also said power supply to households can be increased from 8pm after the shops close, so it would be easier to mange the nighttime load. The last caretaker government imposed restrictions on shops operating after 8pm, but the incumbent government later extended the deadline to 9pm. Prime minister's power and energy adviser Toufique-e-Elahi Chowdhury, power division secretary Abul Kalam Azad, energy and mineral resources division secretary Mezbahuddin and Power Development Board chairman ASM Alamgir, among others, were present at the meeting. The state minister said the number of irrigation pumps running on electricity rose to 75,345 this year from 60,474 last year, raising the electricity demand for irrigation to 1,600 megawatt from 1,250 mw. Currently, the country's daily average electricity generation stands at 3,800 mw against an estimated demand for 4,300 mw, which would rise to 4,500 mw during the summer. The deficit stems partly because some gas-based power stations remain inoperative as the government has diverted gas supply to fertiliser factories. The production in those units would resume soon, Enamul said. He said tender would be invited within this month to set up gridline to import power from India. Toufique said the load management would cause some inconvenience to the urban consumers. "The government has taken the decision since it gives the highest priority to the agriculture sector."
