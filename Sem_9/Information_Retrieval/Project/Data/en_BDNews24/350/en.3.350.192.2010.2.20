 Dhaka, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com)  A memorandum of understanding was signed on Saturday between the state-owned power operators of Bangladesh and India for cooperation in the power sector, an official said. Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) signed the agreement with National Thermal Power Company (NTPC) for assistance to set up a coal-fired power plant, develop human resources and in renovate old plants in Bangladesh, a BPDB official told bdnews24.com. Power secretary Abul Kalam Azad led the Bangladesh side in the secretary-level talks of the Joint Steering Committee on Power Sector, which agreed on the cooperation on Friday. Indian power secretary, HS Brahma, signed for his side. Two MoUs regarding cross-border grid connectivity were signed Friday night. The committee also reached an understanding on building a 1320MW coal-fired power plant in Khulna (2X660MW) at an approximate cost of $ 1.8 billion. The latest agreements came during the secretary-level talks in Dhaka, to thrash out the modalities of power cooperation, after a summit meeting in Delhi last month between the two heads of governments that pledged more power cooperation. According to the MoU signed Saturday, BPDB and NTPC will equally share the ownership of the plant, which will be managed by NTPC. The procurement process will be launched in July and the plant completed within 3 years, if the feasibility studies and land acquisition process are done immediately. As part of the cooperation, NTPC will assist in feasibility studies of some other proposed coal-based power plants. It will also assist in development of skills among Bangladeshi power officials. Meanwhile, NPTC will also undertake technical renovation and tuning of existing plants that have lost generation capacity. BPDB will allow NTPC for renovation in such a plant, while the number will be increased, if successful, vigorously after preparing a list of such plants. In this context, the power secretary said, "Discipline in financial activities will be assured strictly."
