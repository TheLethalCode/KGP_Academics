 Dhaka, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com)  Three people were injured when a train collided with a microbus at Mahakhali rail crossing at around 9.00pm on Friday. The injured, microbus driver Jahangir Hossain (28), and passers by Mona (22) and Shubhro (26) were admitted to a local clinic. A police official from the spot told bdnews24.com that they were not in danger. A sub-inspector of Gulshan police station Abdul Matin said, an outbound train from Dhaka collided with a microbus that was heading towards Jahangir Gate of the Dhaka Cantonment. Jahangir Hossain, the microbus driver, told bdnews24.com that the cross-bar was lifted once an inbound train had passed. But once he crossed over, Jahangir found that the bar on the other side was still blocking his way and so his vehicle was blocked. It was about this time that out-bound train hit the vehicle. The guard in charge of the level crossing has been missing since the accident said Abdul Matin.
