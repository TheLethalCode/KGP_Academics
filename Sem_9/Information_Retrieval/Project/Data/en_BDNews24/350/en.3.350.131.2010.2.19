 Dhaka, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com)  Family members of the language martyrs on Friday complained that the only time people ask after their welfare was around Feb 21 every year. They criticised the usage of distorted Bangla words in mass media and urged the government to take proper actions. The martyrs' relatives were speaking at a discussion organised by the Dhaka University Alumni Association in memory of the fallen heroes of the language movement of 1952. On February 21 in 1952, hundreds braved a section 144 some and marched on the streets in support of their mother tongue, Bengali, in the then East Pakistan. Abdus Salam, Abul Barkat, Abdul Jabbar, Rafiq Uddin Ahmed, Shafiur Rahman and others died as police opened fire at a large demonstration. Jabbar's son Nurul Islam Badal said, "The government never pays attention to the families of the martyrs. They take hectic preparations ahead of 21st February and as February goes by, the prevailing situation returns." "We become exhausted attending various programmes on 21st February. After that they even disregard the spirit of the language," complained martyr Rafiq's brother Khorshed Alam. Martyr Barkat's cousin M R A Taha told bdnews24.com, "Even after 58 years of the Language Movement, Bangla is being used with distorted accents in Bangladeshi media, which is extremely regrettable." "Protests against this distortion have also become feeble these days," he added. "We have to practice pure Bangla if we want to be Bangali. We have to go for another language movement against this distortion. Or else, cannot claim ourselves Bangalis," said martyr Shafiur's son Shafiqur Rahman. He, however, also put stress on learning English in light of the age of globalisation. bdne
