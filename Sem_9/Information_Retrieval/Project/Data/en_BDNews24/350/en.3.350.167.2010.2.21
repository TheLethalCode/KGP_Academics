<TITLE> PM inaugurates Mother Language Institute </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 21 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina inaugurated the International Mother Language Institute in the capital on Sunday, which aims eventually to help preserve all languages around the world. "Not only Bangla, but all languages of the world will be studied in this institute," Hasina said, as she unveiled a plaque of the building on Amar Ekushey, or Feb 21, as a special tribute to Bangladesh's Language Movement martyrs. Feb 21 is now observed round the world as International Mother Language Day in memory of the students who gave their lives on the day in 1952 for the right to keep their mother tongue, Bangla, as a state language as authorities tried to impose Urdu on the nation. One of the new institute's goals will be to preserve languages in danger of being wiped out. The exact role of the institute is yet to be set, though a draft law has been formulated for its work Among the tasks that have been proposed are spread of Bangla language and literature at home and abroad, making Bangla an official language of the United Nations, circulation of language movement history among member countries of UNESCO, conferring fellowships for language research, and creating a language archive for preserving languages of micro-nations. Hasina said the institute would gain world-class, international status with research groups from all countries would come there to study languages. "This institute will play a special role in preserving the status of all mother languages around the world," the prime minister said. Hasina laid the foundation of the institute, during her previous term as prime minister, way back in March 2001, in presence of the then UN secretary general Kofi Annan. The construction work of the building began later in April that year, but the work was delayed under the successive BNP-led coalition government that came to power in late 2001. It was only after the return of the Awami League-led government last year that construction began again. The original cost of the project was estimated in 2001 as Tk 19.49 crore for a five-floor building. The construction cost rose, however, and it was decided to build a three-floor building, for Tk 17 crore, which the prime minister inaugurated on Sunday. The prime minister said the institute's work would begin soon. The draft law is still currently pending with the finance ministry, project director Abdul Mannan has said. The cabinet, to which the draft law will later be sent, will scrutinise the law before being presented in parliament. The institute can finally begin its work after parliament passes the law. Hasina had some harsh words against her political rival Khaleda Zia's government for the delay in completing construction of the institute. But she added, in ironic tones, "I thank them for not completing the institute in time. If they had, I wouldn't be able to inaugurate it today." The prime minister expressed her government's determination to give the institute an "institutional shape". "We want to give it an institutional shape by formulating due laws and policies so that no one can tamper with its working. We will ensure that it becomes an autonomous institution." Hasina also expressed her gratitude on the day to Bangladeshi expatriates in Canada, Rafiqul Islam and Abdus Salam, for their efforts to get Feb 21 recognised as International Mother Language Day around the world. She said efforts are being made to get Bangla recognised as an official language of the United Nations. bd
