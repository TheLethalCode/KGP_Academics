<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com)  The proposed industrial policy needs to be refashioned in order to make it compatible with the growing needs of the country, senior ministers said on Thursday. The cabinet committee on economic affairs suggested major changes to the proposed policy presented before the senior ministers on Thursday. The suggestions include incorporation of responsibility for environmental protection, guidelines for making state-owned enterprises profitable, and outsourcing for industrial sector. Finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith, also convener of the cabinet committee, told reporters after the meeting that: "Some changes have to be made to the 16-section policy." "It should determine the responsibility of environmental protection, and incorporate detailed guidelines for making the state-owned enterprises profitable as well as for strengthening the small and medium ones," he said. The minister said the outsourcing issue should also be incorporated in the policy. The meeting formed a committee, with Board of Investment chairman Syed Abdus Samad as its head, to include the suggestions before it is placed again for approval. Muhith said the committee had been asked to formulate the draft afresh in consultation with the ministries of industries, commerce and finance incorporating the suggestions. The draft policy, which has classified industries in five categories  large, medium, small, micro and cottage  provides for privatisation of SOEs ensuring alternative employment for the workers and employees. Efforts will be made to make the losing SOEs profitable before divestment, it said. Earlier on Apr 25, industries minister Dilip Barua told a meeting that no more SOEs would be privatised. He had said many privatised factories remained "inoperative or non-functional under new ownership". In some cases, the owners sold the land immediately after taking over the concern, the minister had said. Barua also said government would "invest more in state-owned sectors, reopen closed factories and revive flagging industries". His comments drew immediate flak prompting him to shift his position soon after.
