 UNITED NATIONS, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UN humanitarian chief John Holmes has chided aid agencies working in Haiti for poor coordination and resourcing, which he said weakened confidence in their ability to deliver, according to a leaked e-mail. Holmes called on the agencies to take a more aggressive approach to helping Haiti. Holmes, who recently visited the country after its disastrous Jan. 12 earthquake, confirmed to Reuters on Thursday that the e-mail, first published on the website of the journal Foreign Policy, was genuine and had not been intended to be made public. He said the e-mail, which began "Dear colleagues," was addressed to the main UN and other agencies working on relief for survivors of the Haiti quake, which killed more than 200,000 people and left more than 1 million homeless. UN relief operations in Haiti were hard hit from the outset when the world body's mission chief and more than 90 other staff there were killed in the quake. UN officials have since said that steady progress is being made. But Holmes said that while much had been achieved, there remained "major unmet humanitarian needs," particularly on shelter and sanitation, which with the rainy season approaching could give rise to "large demonstrations." "I fear we have simply not yet injected the necessary resources in some areas in terms of capacity to implement practical programs and deliver on the ground," said Holmes, a Briton who heads the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. "I ask you all to take a fresh hard look at what you are able to do in the key areas, and pursue a much more aggressive approach to meeting the needs." Holmes focused particularly on the system of "clusters," first devised after the 2004 Asian tsunami, whereby relief needs are divided into key sectors, each headed by a single organization, usually a UN agency. There are 12 such clusters in Haiti. Holmes said he was disappointed that little progress had been made on coordinating the various aid groups within each cluster, and that cluster chiefs "continue to struggle without the capacity required." "Several clusters have yet to establish a concise overview of needs and develop coherent response plans, strategies and gap analyses," he said. "This is beginning to show and is leading others to doubt our ability to deliver." "We cannot ... wait for the next emergency for these lessons to be learned," Holmes said. "There is an urgent need to boost significantly capacity on the ground, to improve coordination, strategic planning and provision of aid." Holmes called on the agencies leading the clusters to strengthen their teams. "We can scale our efforts up further and we must do so urgently," he said. Holmes, former US President Bill Clinton who is the top UN envoy on Haiti, and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon were due to announce a revised "flash" -- or emergency -- appeal for Haiti later on Thursday. This is expected to boost the target figure from $575 million to $1.4 billion, UN officials s
