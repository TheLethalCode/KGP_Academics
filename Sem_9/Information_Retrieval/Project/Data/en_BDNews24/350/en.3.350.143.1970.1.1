 Dhaka, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina held up the Bangla Language Movement as an inspiration for others struggling to preserve their heritage around the world, as she handed over the Ekushey Padak 2010 to 15 recipients on Saturday, a day ahead of Amar Ekushey. Amar Ekushey commemorates the sacrifice made by the movement's martyrs on Feb 21 1952. The day is now marked around the world as International Mother Language Day. Addressing the awards ceremony, at Osmani Memorial Auditorium in Dhaka, Hasina called upon all to work for raising the status of the Bangla language. She said the Bangla Language Movement shares its spirit with those people struggling around the world today to preserve their language, culture and heritage. The Ekushey Padak award-winners this year include a Language Movement hero as well as those who have distinguished themselves in their respective fields in culture, arts and science. They are: late Dr Golam Maula (language movement), poet Mohammad Rafique, late Sayeed Ahmed and Helena Khan (literature), Muntasir Mamun (research), late ASHK Sadeque, late Sangharaj Jyotipal Mohathero and Hanif Sanket (social service), Partha Pratim Majumder (mime), Nasiruddin Yusuf (drama), late AKM Abdur Rouf and Imdad Hossain (arts), Ahmed Imtiaz Bulbul (music), Begum Laila Hasan (dance) and late Md Alam (photojournalism). The prime minister said her government is moving to secure recognition of Bangla as an official language of the United Nations, alongside the current six. UNESCO in 1999 declared Feb 21 as International Mother Language Day in recognition of the sacrifice of Bangla-speaking people for the cause of their language in 1952. The day's observance was formally recognised by the United Nations General Assembly in a resolution establishing 2008 as the International Year of Languages
