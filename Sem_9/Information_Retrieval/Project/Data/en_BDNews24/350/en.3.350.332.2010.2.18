<TEXT>
 Sylhet, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com)  At least 20 students were injured when activists of Bangladesh Chhatra League and Islami Chhatra Shibir clashed at Sylhet Government College on Thursday, with BCL adherents setting blaze to a reportedly Shibir-controlled college hostel. Kotwali police chief Mohammad Ali said his men rushed to the spot and brought the situation under control. Firemen battled the hostel fire for about an hour and finally doused the flames at around 1.30pm, Sylhet Fire Station senior officer Ishak Ali told bdnews24.com. Superintendent of the college hostel Iftekher Alam said 12 rooms were almost totally gutted and around 10 others were damaged too. He, however, refrained from naming anyone involved in setting the fire. Witnesses said the violence was sparked at midday as activists of the pro-government BCL tried to prevent those of Shibir, the student wing of opposition party Jamaat, from entering the college for a prize giving ceremony of the college's annual sports competition. Both the feuding organisations threw brick bats at each other, students said. Later, the BCL men set fire to a motorcycle and also to a dozen rooms of the hostel adjacent to the college, which, they alleged, was controlled by Shibir. The fighting continued for around half an hour. Both parties fled the campus as police troops came on the scene at around 12.30pm. b
