 Sirajganj, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com)  MP of Bagura-1 constituency Abdul Mannan, his wife and two others were injured in a road accident in Sirajganj district on Friday. Police and witnesses said the accident occurred near Kadda intersection on the western side of the Bangabandhu Bridge at around 11:30 am when Mannan's Bogra-bound car collided with a human hauler while changing lane suddenly. The other injured are MP's wife Shahad Ara Mannan, their domestic help Madhabi and the human hauler driver, Rafiqul. Bangabandhu Bridge (West) thana police chief Bijoy Krishna Kar said Rafiqul, injured seriously, was admitted to Sirajganj General Hospital. The others were released after they were given first aid, he said. When contacted over phone, Mannan told bdnews24.com: "The traffic system has been very weak in the area as all traffic police personnel at Kadda post were removed recently." All 11 police personnel, including two sergeants, of the post were removed from duty on Jan 25, as charges of extortion and other irregularities mounted against them, an official said that time. At present, only two constables are deployed there to control traffic. bdne
