 Mali, Efb 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)--Nomadic communities in Mali find it difficult to keep their children in school but all this may soon begin to change with the introduction of mobile schools. PLEASE NOTE: THIS EDIT CONTAINS CONVERTED 4:3 MATERIAL Early morning is the best time to fish along the river Niger in central Mali and as usual the Nabo family set off in search of the days catch. It's usually easy to find fish like tilapia and carp when the Niger Delta floods during the cold season. Adama and his family - like most people in this part of Mali are nomadic and follow the yearly floods of the Niger River across the Mopti region three times a year. The fishermen arrive here on the shores of Lake Debo in April, when the flood waters subside. They stay here a few months until the lake dries up and the then move on in search of more fish. But as families move from place to place children like Adama's daughter Aissata, seen here playing in the middle of the circle, can't keep up with their schooling. However all this could be changing with the development of mobile schools, which follow the nomadic communities from place to place. This school in Thiald'd was one of the first, set up in 2007. This school and the other 13 mobile schools in the region for fishing and herding communities - all have curriculums relevant to nomadic culture. (SOUNDBITE) (Male/French) Ibrahima Sankar, Mobile School Initiative, SAYING: "Most of the curriculums used in the rest of the country are created overseas, so they don't take into account local knowledge. If the children don't see the link between their classes and their reality outside, they will attempt to leave school. " Aissata and the other students are also learning their numbers. (SOUNDBITE) (Female/Bozo) AISSATA NABO, Student, SAYING: "When I first started school, I didn't know how to read or write, but now I know how to read, write and count." (SOUNDBITE) (Male/French) Garbia Timinta, SAYING: "No-one had been to school before this school here was established. Now the parents told me that they are satisfied because if they need to write down a telephone number, their children at school can do it." The school also encourages parents to get involved. And those who want to help the school manage its administration affairs attend regular meetings. (SOUNDBITE) (Female/Bozo) Bolo Kampo, Parent, SAYING: "The children we send to school learn faster compared to others, even in their household work or fishing. That's why we think schooling is important." As the day comes to an end, the children return home to help with the household chores. The education they get out here will equip them with skills that many of their parents don't have and that will probably bring positive change to their commun
