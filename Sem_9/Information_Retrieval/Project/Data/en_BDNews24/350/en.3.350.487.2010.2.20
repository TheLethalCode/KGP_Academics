 Khagrachhari, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com)  A regional rights group claimed Saturday that at least three tribal people were killed in army fire at Baghaichhari, Rangamati, on Saturday as clashes continued from the previous night. A local council leader named five tribal men killed in the gunfire. But no army official would officially confirm or deny the report. A local army officer, wishing not to be named, confirmed the death of one person "in the clashes". An army spokesman in Dhaka said he had no knowledge of the incidents in the hill tracts. "I know nothing about what's going on," Lt Col Kazi Mohammad Kabirul Islam, Inter Services PR director, told bdnews24.com Saturday evening. "It wouldn't be right to comment without knowing. Let me first find out." The director of the Asian Centre for Human Rights, Suhas Chakma, could name two of the alleged victims in a statement released from New Delhi. "At least three tribals including Lakkhi Bijoy Chakma and Litan Chakma were shot dead this morning (20 February 2010), dozens were injured in the firing by the Bangladesh Army," he said, "while one Buddhist monk, Purnabash Bhikkhu, has been missing after the Buddhist temple was burnt down." "At least four indigenous/tribal villages - Gangaram Doar, Retkaba, Purba Para and Guchachagram - under Sajek Sub-Division of the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh have been burnt into ashes. "In addition, at least 7 shops in Ladumani bazaar, one UNDP sponsored village centre providing assistance to the indigenous villagers, one church and one Buddhist temple were burnt down yesterday night (19 February 2010). "This particular attack on the indigenous Jumma peoples shows that the government of Bangladesh has failed to change its policy of indiscriminate killings of indigenous Jumma people in order to occupy their lands and implant more illegal plain settlers instead of implementing the Chittagong Hill Tracts Accord of 1997." Reports from the neighbouring Khagrachhari said the clashes between indigenous and settler communities at Baghaichhari left as many as five dead, at least 50 houses and shops torched. Baghaichhari Upazila chairman Sudarshan Chakma named the dead: Shantashil Chakma (27), Natun Joy Chakma (32), Lakkhi Bijoy Chakma (40), Litan Chakma (25) and Bhuddhapati Chakma (36). Local authorities earlier imposed a ban on public gatherings around midday Saturday in Baghaichari as tensions mounted between the tribals and Bengali settlers in the remote Upazila, bordering Khagrachhari. Different accounts were received of casualties and fatalities during the clashes that first ignited on Friday night. Earlier Saturday morning, Rangamati DC Surendranath Chakrabarti and neighbouring Khagrachari DC Mohammad Abdullah told bdnews24.com that the situation in Baghaichari was "under control". "There was tension on Friday night, but the situation is quiet now. Law enforcers have remained alert," Surendranath had told bdnews24.com. However, things apparently flared up again. A number of locals said army personnel coming on the scene Saturday morning opened fire on them. Speaking to bdnews24.com, Rangamati district PCJSS general secretary Bodhisatwa Chakma echoed the Upazila chairman on the casualties. The Asian Centre for Human Rights (ACHR) sought the intervention of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and called for "taking appropriate actions". The tribals claim the settlers were the first to open on them, followed by army shooting. The army and the Bengali settlers say the tribals initiated the attack. Long-standing animosity exists between indigenous communities and settlers in the region where army have been deployed for decades. But tensions have risen again recently with the government's move to start implementing the 1997 Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord after a long gap. Local journalists said members of Parbatya Bangali Chhatra Parishad, a student organisation of the settlers, beat an indigenous man at Baghaichhari Bazaar during a procession in the evening, sparking the violence at night. The two groups clashed again on Saturday morning, when at least another 20 houses at Hajachhara, Guchchha Gram, Balughat, Simanachhara, Baipaichhara, Suranganala and Kerekkaba villages were torched. The two sides blamed each other for the arson. Dharmabir Chakma, chairman of Dighinala Upazila, adjacent to Baghaichari, blamed the "anti-Peace Accord settlers". "Members of Parbatya Bangali Chhatra Parishad and other such activists torched the houses of the tribal people in a pre-planned way," he told bdnews24.com after visiting the site. Chhatra Parishad chief Yakub, however, told bdnews24.com that the tribal people made the arson attack. Road communications on Baghaichhari-Sajek route remained suspended for some time after the incident. Both Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samity (PCJSS) and United People's Democratic Front (UPDF) announced Saturday that they would blockade road and river routes in Rangamati and Khagrachari on Monday to protest the killing of indigenous people. bdne
