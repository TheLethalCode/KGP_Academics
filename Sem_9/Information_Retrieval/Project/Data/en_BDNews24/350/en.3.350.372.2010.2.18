 DUBAI, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Dubai's police chief said he is almost certain Israel's Mossad spy agency was behind the murder of a Hamas militant at a Dubai hotel, a newspaper reported, raising the stakes in an escalating international row over the killing. Hamas military official Mahmoud al-Mabhouh was found dead in his luxury hotel room in January, and the Palestinian Islamist militant group has accused Israel of being behind the killing.

Interpol says a red notice is not an international arrest warrant, but is put out after authorities in a country issue a warrant to help with the identification or location of a suspect with a view to their arrest or extradition. Mossad is widely believed to have stepped up covert missions against Hamas and Lebanon's Hezbollah militia as well as Iran's nuclear project. Among killings attributed to Mossad was that of Hezbollah commander Imad Moughniyeh in Damascus two years ago. Mabhouh, who was born in the Gaza Strip but had lived in Syria since 1989, was killed a day after he arrived in Dubai. Both a Hamas official and Israel have said Mabhouh masterminded the abduction and killing of two Israeli soldiers during a Palestinian uprising in the 19
