<TITLE> Australian PM shifts focus to health in election year </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SYDNEY, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd on Friday hinted he may call an early election over the populist issue of health, as media reported a new health plan to be released in March would be his centrepiece at 2010 elections. Political analysts had believed Rudd's embattled climate policy, twice rejected by a hostile Senate, could be the focus of his re-election campaign, but with voter support waning, health may now be a more attractive issue. The government holds a commanding lead in opinion polls, but Rudd's personal rating is the lowest since he was elected in 2007 and he needs a circuit breaker to stop a resurgent opposition before a national election due by the end of the year. The Sydney Morning Herald reported the government had made its reforms of private health insurance, which will raise some A$1.9 billion in revenue over three years, a priority over its embattled carbon emissions trading scheme legislation. "Climate change has slid down the order of election priorities with the government to dedicate next week in parliament to gaining a double dissolution (election) trigger on health," the Herald said. A double dissolution election sees both houses of parliament dissolved for re-election, and if the government wins the poll it would then stage a joint sitting of both houses to pass the legislation which sparked the election. Asked on television on Friday to rule out an early election on health, Rudd refused, saying "let's just see what they (the Senate) do", adding his health reforms were a huge budgetary measure. "I would much rather have that (money) to invest in the public hospital needs of our country," said Rudd, who has promised voters he will fix the country's hospitals which are struggling to cope with patient demand from an ageing population. HEALTH OVERTAKES CLIMATE Rudd will unveil a wider public health reform plan, which will be "an election centrepiece", next month, said the Herald. It would be easier for Rudd to campaign on health reforms which hit high income earners with a means test on a government rebate for private health insurance, rather than climate policy which many voters now oppose. This could affect health firms like NIB and private hospital operators like Ramsay Health Care Ltd and Healthscope. The opposition has vowed to defeat the health legislation in the Senate a second time. Rudd has also promised a federal takeover of state-administered hospitals, but few political watchers expect him to carry it out, given its likely A$3-5 billion cost. The government already has an election trigger over climate policy, which has been rejected twice in the Senate. A revised climate policy is also set for defeat in Senate. Rudd has repeatedly said governments should go full term, but a new opposition leader Tony Abbott has rallied his conservative party and gained traction with voters. In an attempt to win back voters, analysts say Rudd may also be forced to abandon plans for comprehensive reform of the A$278 billion taxation system that threatens to lift the tax impost, or reverse plans for a tough May 11 budget. The government has already committed itself to an austere budget that locks in savings and promises a faster return to surplus, as well as a 2 percent cap on spending increases, as the economy recovers from the global financial cris
