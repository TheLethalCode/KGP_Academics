 Dhaka, Feb 21 (bdnews24.com)  Main opposition BNP has expressed its concern over the deaths and damages to property during the clashes between indigenous and settler communities at Baghaichhari in Rangamati district last two days. Party's senior joint secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir expressed the concern at a press conference at his Uttara residence on Sunday. He said: "The security of the Bangali and indigenous people and their property is now at stake due to the clashes. The government will have to take its responsibility." Local leaders say at least five indigenous villagers were killed as army opened fire during clashes. But local administration confirmed death of two. The BNP leader said their party was trying to convince the government not to withdraw army from there without having discussions with parties concerned as Chittagong Hill Tracts is a 'sensitive area'. He sought a quick response from the government to ensure security of the residents there. Responding to a journalist's query, Fakhrul said: "The decision to withdraw army was a blunder. We had expressed our concern that time that army pullout might invite catastrophic consequences." He said army presence is necessary in the hill districts to ensure a peaceful co-existence of the indigenous and settler communities as well as to ensure their security. "We demanded re-evaluation of the (CHT) Peace Treaty after its signing observing that otherwise balanced co-existence of the two communities would be hampered. Army pullout has seriously affected that balance," he added. The BNP leader came down hard on the government for not allowing opposition leader Khaleda Zia to pay homage to the language martyrs at the Central Shaheed Minar under state protocol after the zero hour of Feb 21. b
