 DUBAI, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New evidence incriminating Israel's spy agency in the assassination of a Hamas commander in Dubai includes credit card payments and phone calls made by suspects, an Arabic-language daily reported on Saturday. Police have already said the 11 suspects used forged passports in the names of innocent individuals of several European nationalities. "Dubai police have information confirming that the suspects purchased travel tickets from companies in other countries with credit cards carrying the same names we have publicised (in the passports)," Al Bayan daily on Saturday quoted Dubai police chief Dahi Khalfan Tamim as saying. It did not give further details. Palestinian Mahmoud al-Mabhouh was found dead in his room in a luxury Dubai hotel on Jan. 20, a day after arriving in the emirate. Dubai police have released photographs of the 11 suspects. The international criminal police organisation Interpol said on Thursday it had issued "red notices" for their arrest in any of its 188 member countries. Dubai's police chief said on Thursday he believed Israeli agents were responsible for killing al-Mabhouh, a senior member of the Islamist group which rules Gaza, and called for the Mossad spy agency's chief to be arrested if its responsibility was proved. Britain offered on Friday new passports to six British citizens whose identities were used by the suspects and all of whom live in Israel, to protect them from inadvertent arrest through Interpol. Other suspects identified by Dubai used cloned passports from Ireland, France and Germa
