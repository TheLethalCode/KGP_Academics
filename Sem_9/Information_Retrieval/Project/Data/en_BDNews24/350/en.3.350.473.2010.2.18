 LONDON, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran will not give up uranium enrichment and the West must get used to an Iran that is a "master of enrichment", Tehran's envoy to the UN nuclear watchdog was quoted on Wednesday as saying. Iran was "always ready to talk in a civilised manner", Ali Asghar Soltanieh said in an interview with New Statesman, a British current affairs magazine.

Soltanieh said the language of threats reflected a "colonialist mentality". "By threatening Iran with the Security Council, with sanctions, with military action, you are just making life more difficult for yourself -- it doesn't work," he said.

So far, Obama has been unable to deliver, and on occasion has resorted to using the same language of threats as (former President) George W. Bush. This is very disappointing," he said. Obama came to office vowing to break with Bush's policy of seeking to isolate Iran. But he has taken a tougher stance since the disputed elections there last June and the passing of a deadline for Tehran to accept the fuel swap de
