<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com)  An Indo-Bangla joint steering committee meeting on power has decided to complete cross-border power grid connection within 2 years. Power secretary Abul Kalam Azad said that the two countries had finalised their grid connection procedure, and agreed on the establishment of a 1320MW coal-fired power plant. The connection opens up the possibility for importing 250 megawatts, which is enough to meet the power demand of Mymensingh zone with 200MW, Sylhet zone with 198MW or Rangpur zone with 175MW. Indian power secretary said that it would sell power to Bangladesh at the cheapest rates of Rs 2~2.5, while the household consumers in Bangladesh currently pay about Tk 2.5 per unit. The National Thermal Power Cooperation (NTPC) and the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) will sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) Friday night, he said. "The project requires 130km grid connectivity with 85km in India and 45km in Bangladesh." The joint committee was headed by Indian power secretary HS Brahma on one side and Azad headed the Bangladesh delegation. According to the secretary, the committee decided to call for tenders on Feb 28, followed by a work order in July this year. "As per the experts, the project may take 24 months to be completed." The cost for installing the grid will be carried out by the respective countriesTk 1100 crore for Bangladesh and about Tk 200 crore for India. The power secretary explained that the cost was comparatively higher for Bangladesh 'as we have to set up a Hi-Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) sub-station on our side'. Brahma said the MoU was only the beginning and stressed on increasing per capita consumption of electricity and access of the population that are currently at 184 kWh and 47 percent respectively in Bangladesh. He said power generation in Bangladesh should be increased by 2000-3000MW every year. "The Indian government is keen to help Bangladesh develop wherever it needs, especially in the power sector," said Brahma. The grid will also allow both the countries for further steps to import or export power from each other, the Indian power secretary said. The Indian government plans to provide 250MW at a variable price depending on its production cost, said Azad. Power will be transmitted from India's eastern zone to reduce transmission costs, he added. Both the teams also agreed on setting up of a coal-fired power plant in Khulna with a capacity of 1320MW (two units of 660MW each) costing about $1.8 billion. "BPDB and NTPC will equally share the plant, which will be managed by NTPC since it has a wide experience with coal-based plants," Azad said. But he did not mention the source of coal, which will be imported, adding that the decision will be made by the operating firm. The power plant would operate as an Independent Power Plant (IPP), operated by a private company. Procurement process will be launched in July and the plant will be completed within 3 years, if the feasibility studies and land acquisition are done immediately, he said. BPDB will contribute 25 percent of the equity, while the rest will be managed by NTPC, he added. Citing the recent gas crisis, the secretary said, "We've to go for coal in the future. We don't have options." "There is coal in northern Bangladesh, which we must harness." OTHER AREAS OF ASSISTANCE As part of the cooperation, NTPC will also assist in human resource development to increase skills of Bangladeshi officials, Azad said. Meanwhile, NPTC will undertake technical renovation and tuning of the installed plants, which have lost generation capacity. "BPDB will prepare a list of such plants and if successful, we'll go for vigorous works, where we'll ensure discipline in financial affairs," Azad said. INDIAN PRIVATE FIRMS Azad said the proposed plants of Bangladesh were presented to the private companies as well. "But they didn't give feedback." The private company officials are expected to sit with the power officials on Friday and Saturday as they've asked for
