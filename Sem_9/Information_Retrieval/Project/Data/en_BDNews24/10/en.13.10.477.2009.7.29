<TITLE> Venezuela "will freeze" ties with Colombia: Chavez </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CARACAS,Jul 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Venezuela will withdraw its ambassador from Colombia and freeze relations with its Andean neighbor, President Hugo Chavez said on Tuesday, following days of accusations over troop buildups and alleged arms supplies. "I've ordered to withdraw our ambassador from Bogota, to withdraw our diplomatic personnel," the Venezuelan leader said in a televised Cabinet meeting. "We will freeze relations with Colombia," he added. There was no immediate comment from the Colombian government. The move ratchets up tensions in the Andean region, which had been pushed to the brink of armed conflict when Venezuela moved troops to its border with Colombia after Bogota bombed a rebel camp in Ecuador in March 2008. The announcement came a day after Colombia said weapons bought by Venezuela in Sweden had made their way to FARC rebels, who have been fighting the Bogota government for more than four decades. Colombian Vice President Francisco Santos said on Monday his government is investigating how the anti-tank weapons found their way to the FARC -- the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. Chavez said the accusation was unfounded and a "big manipulation." He said the FARC obtained weapons from several countries, including the United States, Russia and Israel, but that Colombia had singled out Venezuela to blame. Chavez complained that Colombia's intention to host more U.S. troops to help fight drug traffickers there was a threat against Venezuela. "The Colombian government is showing it doesn't care at all about its relations with Venezuela," he said. HURT TRADE TIES? Analysts say Chavez may be trying to rally behind the flag to stem a further fall in his popularity as weaker oil revenues put a strain on the OPEC nation's economy and public finances. He is concerned his support in the national assembly after elections next year could fall below the necessary two-thirds to approve key legislation, analysts say. The former paratrooper, who has been in power for just over a decade, has also renewed his fierce anti-American rhetoric that he had toned down after President Barack Obama took office in January. Venezuela will also substitute imports from Colombia, Chavez said. He said the oil-rich Caribbean nation would look more toward Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia and others for its large imports of farm and manufactured products. "We could close that gas pipeline (from Colombia)," the former coup leader said. But some analysts said trade ties with Colombia were unlikely to be cut off abruptly, given the two neighbors' mutual dependence. Venezuelan imports from Colombia jumped from $1 billion to nearly $7 billion in a decade, Chavez said. Following the announcement, Chavez continued his televised Cabinet meeting, which included songs and cakes to celebrate his 55th birthday as well as presents, including a golden sword from Russian Deputy Prime Minister Igor Se
