<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 29 (bdnews24.com)  The government has announced the "biggest withdrawal" of army troops from the Chittagong Hill Tracts since a peace accord was signed over a decade ago in an attempt to bring stability to the long-troubled region. The pullout of a complete brigade, including three infantry battalions and 35 security camps, will start immediately, said an official statement on Wednesday. The withdrawal will be completed by September. "This will be the biggest army withdrawal from the area after the [accord was] signed," said a press release of the Inter Services Public Relations Directorate . "The government is expecting that this army withdrawal would be considered as a milestone by the hill people to implement the pledges given by the government." Since the CHT peace treaty was signed 12 years ago, a total of 200 security camps have been withdrawn from the tracts in different phases, according to the statement. The Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord was signed in 1997 in order to end insurgency and establish permanent peace in the region. Troubled region The army was deployed in the troubled region after indigenous communities, led by Chakma leaders, took up arms in the 1970s in protest against the government of a newly independent Bangladesh for its "inaction" over key demands. These included decommissioning the Kaptai hydroelectric project and restoration of traditional land rights. The Kaptai Lake, built in the 1960s, inundated the palace of the Chakma King and vast tracts of land displacing thousands of people. Many fled across the border to India to wage a campaign of insurgency against the Bangladesh Army. According to the peace deal signed with Pabatya Chattagram Janasanghati Saminit (PCJSS) in 1997, the government pledged to pull out army troops from the CHT in phases. The previous Awami League government, which signed the original deal, began implementing the peace accord. But the implementation came to a halt under the subsequent BNP-led government. 'Further steps' The official statement of troop withdrawal on Wednesday also mentioned further measures to implement the peace accord. "To implement the treaty Bangladesh has taken some steps of which the highlights are (a) To form Peace Treaty Implementation Committee in national level to observe the Peace Treaty Implementation procedure. (b) To reform Parliamentary Standing Committee on Chittagong Hill Tracts Affairs and arrange continuous meeting to resolve multifaceted problems of Chittagong Hill Districts, (c) To start reform process of land commission," said the statement. "The government is seeking all out co-operation and support of hill people and other population to ensure co-existence of all the people irrespective of religion and caste and to restore law and order situation and development activities to continue in the area," it added. Ricoh Chakma, president of the Chittagong Hill Tracts Chhatra Parishad, told bdnews24.com, "The government has promised so many things. But they are not believable unless they implement them in reality." bdnew
