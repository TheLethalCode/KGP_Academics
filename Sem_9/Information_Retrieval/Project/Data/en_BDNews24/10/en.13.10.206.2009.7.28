<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 28 (bdnews24.com)  Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda, in a pointed statement on Tuesday, said the Election Commission has "inherent power" to cancel any MP's parliamentary membership. Huda has previously said the EC was considering "the legal implications" before deciding whether to cancel opposition MP Salauddin Quader Chowdhury's seat, who is accused of violating electoral laws ahead of last December's general elections. The latter is charged with submitting false information in his affidavit during the nomination process ahead of the December 2008 general election. Chowdhury, a senior BNP leader, has maintained he did not submit false information to the EC. The Election Commission consulted with its lawyer Dr Kamal Hossain on a number of issues Monday. Whether legal action against Chowdhury was one of those issues is not known, but Huda's statement on Tuesday carried more force than previous comments. Huda was also speaking just hours after Chowdhury had announced he was preparing to file a case against the caretaker government and the Election Commission, among others, for violation of the constitution. Chowdhury said he will seek to have sedition charges brought against former president Iajuddin Ahmed, former caretaker government chief Fakhruddin Ahmed, former army chief Moeen U Ahmed, chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda and eight others for the '1/11 takeover' and subsequent two-year emergency government. "I have started all preparations to seek a High Court order asking the government to take steps to press sedition charges against them," Chowdhury told reporters at a press conference at his residence earlier Tuesday. Chowdhury slammed the EC, terming it the 'Fakhruddin-Moeen nominated' commission. "They worked to split BNP, to omit Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina from politics," said Chowdhury. Election chief Shamsul Huda was later approached by reporters as he emerged from his office. "The Election Commission has inherent power to move against any MP," he said in reply to questions regarding what the EC was doing in turn about the charges against Chowdhury of violating the electoral code. "Steps will be taken against him in due time," said Huda. When pressed about what steps the EC would take against Chowdhury, brushed off the query, "I don't want to hear his name. He is of no particular importance. I don't see his words as important." Huda had made a similar comment before. On July 19, the CEC said, "[Chowdhury] is just one of many MPs we have received complaints about both before and after elections." "We have many other cases to consider too." Chowdhury was elected MP from Chittagong-2 as MP in ninth parliamentary elections on Dec 29, 2008. bd
