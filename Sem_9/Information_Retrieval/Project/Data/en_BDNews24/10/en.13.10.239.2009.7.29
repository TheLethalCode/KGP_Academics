 Dhaka, July 29 (bdnews24.com)  Islami Oikya Jote (IOJ) chairman Fazlul Haque Amini emanded expulsion of Indian High Commissioner Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty in a press conference on Wednesday. "Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty has shown scorn and indecorum to the people of this country. It is a breach of the diplomatic code of conduct and the Geneva Convention," Amini said at the National Press Club. Chakravarty has been criticised by different political parties in recent weeks for brushing off Bangladesh's concerns regarding India's Tipaimukh Dam project, and, on a separate but equally sensitive issue, referring to "visa-seeking Bangladeshis". "His recent statements threaten the relationship between the two countries. Therefore, we are asking the government to expel him," said Amini whose party belongs to the BNP-led four-party alliance. Pressing this demand further, he announced a human chain programme to be held in front of the National Press Club on August 3. Main opposition BNP, among others, have demanded his expulsion. Amini also criticised the recent law to ensure lifetime security for the family of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. IOJ secretary general Abdul Latif Nezami, vice-president Maolana Abdur Rakib, joint secretary Mufti Tayyab, Majlishe Shura member Maolana Ershadullah and publicity secretary Maolana Ahlullah Wasel were present at the press conference. bdn
