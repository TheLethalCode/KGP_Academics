 Dhaka, Jul 27 (bdnews24.com)Insurers are opposed to draft legislation that proposes the regulatory agency be the arbitrator in insurance claim disputes, saying such disputes were "a matter between the insurer and the insured". They are also against the proposed requirement for companies to submit annual fees for renewal of registration. "Banks and financial institutions do not have to do so  we think the same should apply for insurance entities," Rafiqul Islam, president of Bangladesh Insurance Association (BIA), said Monday. He said his association was also concerned about the proposed bar on operating regular and Islamic insurance schemes simultaneously. Islam was speaking at a meeting between the BIA and members of the parliamentary standing committee on the finance ministry to chalk out the pros and cons of the proposed Insurance Act and Insurance Regulatory Authority Act. The past caretaker government passed the laws by ordinance in July 2007; they are now awaiting passage in parliament. The BIA president welcomed the provision that requires insurance companies to raise their capital base. "But this is a huge task and so we propose to do this thing gradually over the next 10 years," Islam told the meeting. AHM Mustafa Kamal MP, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee, stressed the need for an ombudsman for the sector. He said that the parliamentary committee would make all-out efforts for a law that benefits both the insurers and the clients. Association members suggested an 11-point reform agenda at the meeting. Nasir A Chowdhury of Delta Insurance criticised the proposal for the head of the regulatory authority being the arbitrator of insurance claim disputes. "It is a matter between the insurer and the insured... the regulator has no role to play here." Under the new law, the proposed Insurance Regulatory Authority would replace the Department of Insurance to oversee the companies and safeguard interests of policyholders. Chowdhury also rejected the provision for setting an age limit of 67 for managing directors of insurers. Regarding Islamic insurance Golam Mortuza, a top official of Fareast Islamic Life Insurance, said: "Introduction of Islamic insurance has widened the client base for the industry." Countries like, Indonesia, Bahrain, Qatar, Sudan have separate laws and regulations for Islamic insurance, which have proven to be successful and could be applied in Bangladesh, said Mortuza. The standing committee chairman AHM Mustafa Kamal backed the insurers saying: "If banks can operate Islamic wings then why not insurance companies?" He also asked insurers to keep on track with corporate social responsibilities. Kamal emphasised on the need for local insurance companies to strengthen their base in the wake of stiff competition from foreign insurers operating in the country On a separate issue, the BIA president expressed the industry's interest to participate in PPP (public-private partnership) initiatives, newly introduced in the Awami League's maiden budget. Islam said the industry is well placed to channel funds. According to the existing regulatory framework, insurers can invest 30 percent of their funds in land and real estate. "But we wonder why there is no clear guideline on this in the budget," he said.
