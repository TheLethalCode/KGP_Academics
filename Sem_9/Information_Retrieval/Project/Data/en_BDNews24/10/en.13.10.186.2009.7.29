<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 29 (bdnews24.com)  The 10-member parliamentary delegation headed for India on Wednesday to visit the proposed Tipaimukh dam site. The delegation led by water resources parliamentary standing committee chief Abdur Razzaq MP left Dhaka for the Indian capital aboard a Jet Airways plane at 10am. Razzaq, ahead of leaving the country told bdnews24.com that it was 'sad' that BNP had made some derogatory comments on the delegation. "Irresponsible comments passed by responsible persons may only end as attempts to belittle the parliament of a sovereign country," the former water resources minister said, referring to what the ex-water resources minister and BNP leader Hafizuddin Ahmed said on Tuesday about the delegation. Hafiz had termed the state representatives team as a 'one party delegation' and that it was merely a 'picnic party'. "As the team doesn't have any expert, it won't be acceptable to the people and therefore, fail to make any progress towards resolving the debacle," Hafiz said. The members of the parliamentary team include Awami League MPs Abdur Rahman, ABM Anwarul Haq and Jahir Hossain, Jatiya Party MP ABM Ruhul Amin Hawlader and independent MP Fazlul Azim. Besides, it has two expertsBUET Prof Monwar Hossain and Sajjad Hossain of the Bangladesh-India Joint Rivers Commission. The other two members are water resources secretary Waheduzzaman and foreign ministry director general Emran Ahmed. Jamaat-e-Islami MP Hamidur Rahman Azad did not join the delegation at the last moment as he fell ill. BNP failed to name two members for the team, even though the party has been among the loudest critics of the dam project in recent months. The main opposition party has been firing from the sidelines, however, unwilling to raise its concerns in parliament as its MPs have been boycotting the House almost continuously since January. bdnew
