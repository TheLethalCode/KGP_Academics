 Dhaka, July 28 (bdnews24.com)At least five people died as a result of accidental electrocution in separate incidents in the city following the record overnight rains, police said Tuesday. According to the Dhaka Power Distribution Company, at least 12 people have been electrocuted in the capital in July alone. "We remain vigilant during storms, and we always cut the power if we discover any problems," Ataus Masud, managing director of DPDC, told bdnews24.com. Thirty-year-old Shafiqul Islam died when he came in contact with a faulty electrical wire in his house in Bhashantek, Kafrul Police Station sub-inspector, Moshtaq Ahmed, told bdnews24.com. In a separate incident in Demra, 35-year-old housewife Jannatul Mawa died when she received an electric shock from an electric water pump, said Tofazzal Hossain of Demra Police Station. Hossain said many electric household appliances in the area had become dangerous due to the influx of water into private residences. Twenty-five-year-old Abdul Qader from Arambagh died when he came into contact with an electric pole in front of the Arambagh petrol station, said Motijheel sub-inspector of police Badruddin Ahmed. Sub-inspector of Kotwali Police Station Harunur Rashid said two young men, only one who had been identified so far as garments worker Al Amin, were electrocuted when a faulty power cable touched a tube well near Suritola Bridge Tuesday morning. The body of a 20-year-old man, identified by police as one Shahin, was recovered from shallow water in the Beribandh area of Mohammadpur, but the cause of death was unconfirmed. Earlier this month, on July 1, two people, a mother and son, died after coming in contact with a broken overhead power cable that fell to the ground during rains outside their home at Nazimuddin Road in Lalbagh. On July 2, another three were killed in two separate electrocution incidents, a housewife and her maid-servant at Moghbazar came into contact with a torn electric line, and a labourer at Kadomtoli died in similar circumstances. Two people were electrocuted as they were working on a construction site in Dhanmondi on July 6. DPDC's managing director Ataus Masud said Tuesday the power company automatically shuts off electricity if a fault develops in a supply line. "Power is resumed after checking." "In the Magbazar incident on July 2, the line was shut after it split and the two victims were electrocuted after the line was resumed," Masud added. "DPDC is not responsible for the incidents of Monday night and Tuesday morning," he said. "DESCO (Dhaka Electricity Supply Company) operates the line in Bhashantek. In Arambagh, the man was electrocuted by a DCC street light pole and the woman at Demra died being careless at home." "We had shut the lines as a security measure at Mohammadpur, Rajabazar, Kamlapur and Nakhalpara today as we were informed by the people about the overflow of water," Masud said. He asked all to inform the DPDC control room if there is any problem with the power supply line during natural disasters. Managing director of DESCO Saleh Ahmed told bdnews24.com, "According to the system, power supply is automatically shut off when a line is split somewhere. We'll investigate why the supply at Bhashantek wasn't shut even after a line split." bdn
