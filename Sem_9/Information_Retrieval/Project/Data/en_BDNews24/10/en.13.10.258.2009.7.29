 Dhaka, July 29 (bdnews24.com) The government should go for procuring more paddy than rice to compensate farmers fairly, deputy commissioners recommended Wednesday in their meeting with food minister Abdur Razzaq on the second day of a three-day DCs conference being held in the city. "In the context of the DCs' advice, we've intimated that the government at present lacks food godowns," Razzaq told reporters after the meeting. "The government plans to construct more godowns. Paddy procurement by the government will have to wait till we have built larger grain silos, as it requires relatively more space for storage." "To encourage farmers to grow more paddies, the government already offers to provide different incentives. Besides, further assistance may be provided by slashing costs of agricultural inputs." The minister said, "Already directly involved in development, law and order maintenance and disaster management in the districts, the DCs have been directed to be more active as the guardians in such roles." He said, the caretaker government's 100-day employment creation programme had been riddled with irregularities and corruption, the DCs said, which resulted in causing the intervention fail eventually. The DCs also suggested building more cyclone shelters along the coasts and bolstering coastal embankment maintenance, Razzaq said. "In the wake of the cyclone 'Aila', the government has taken steps to erect 800 more shelters and sought donors' assistance for speedily implementing the scheme," was his response, the minister informed. Mentioning the DCs' role in implementing social security programmes such as, 'test relief' and 'food for work' Razzaq said, "The district officers have been warned against alleged irregularities and corruption in handling these programmes." After the Grand Alliance government assumed office on January 6, this is the first formal conference of the deputy commissioners. The PM has held some meetings with the DCs though. b
