 Anisur Rahman bdnews24.com Sports Correspondent Dhaka, July 29 (bdnews24.com)A spirited Bangladesh wrapped up their first one-day international series against a makeshift West Indies with a match in hand on the back of their highest run chase early on Wednesday. The visitors celebrated their 200th ODI with the historic series win, their first against a current Test-playing nation, when they handed a three-wicket defeat to the hosts in the rain-hit second match at Windsor Park, Roseau, in Dominica. The Tigers had earlier won their 100th and 150th matches too, against India. The Tigers' tour, which offered plenty of drama even before a ball was bowled when the regulars led by Chris Gayle pulled out over a lingering pay dispute with the West Indies Cricket Board, could well come to a close with a clean sweep. Mohammad Ashraful and man-of-the-match Shakib Al Hasan struck back-to-back fifties as the Tigers raced to 276 for 7 with an over to spare after West Indies posted a fighting 274-6 riding on a maiden century from Travis Dowlin. It is for the first time that Bangladesh clinched both Test and ODI series on foreign soil after they achieved the same feat against Zimbabwe at home in 2005. Bangladesh's previous-best successful chase was 249 against Australia in Cardiff in 2005. Abdur Razzak smacked the winning boundary to send his team and millions of bleary-eyed fans back home into a spasm of delight. Needing 56 runs off 48 deliveries, Shakib and Mushfiqur Rahim took the fourth powerplay and 19 runs came off the very first over. Bangladesh eventually cashed in on the three players being outside the circle during the powerplay to pick up 48 runs to close the gap. They lost the wickets of Shakib, Mahmudullah and Mushfiqur Rahim, who played a timely 30-ball 31 and added 48 runs with his captain. Razzak (11) along with Naeem Islam (3) completed the remaining task. Chasing an uphill task, openers Tamim Iqbal and Junaed Siddique survived some nervy moments from the word go to give Bangladesh a solid start contributing 29 and 23 runs respectively. Ashraful and Raqibul Hasan negotiated the fast bowlers to put up a nice 74-run partnership for the fourth wicket. When it seemed a fluent Ashraful was going toward his third ODI hundred, he threw his wicket away with a lofty shot for 64 off 77 deliveries that included three fours and one six. Shakib, who survived a run-out scare on one, made a 61-ball 65 studded with two fours and one six before holing out at short third man off Darren Sammy, who returned 39-1. "I can't explain the feeling. The boys have tried their best and we did well," man-of-the-match Shakib said at the presentation ceremony. "The batting powerplays are very crucial and you have to take them at the right time, and take it seriously. "They batted well, handled the spinners well. The team has been supporting us throughout the series and so have the support staff." Earlier, Dowlin, batting at number four, negotiated the Bangladeshi spinners well to reach exactly 100 not out and had three significant partnerships with Devon Smith, Dave Bernard and Rawl Lewis. Right-handed Dowlin got off to a sedate start to make 50 off 88 balls with a boundary. But the 32-year-old batsman got more adventurous to reach his hundred, consuming only 29 balls that included another five boundaries and one six. Dowlin added 66 runs for the third wicket with Devon Smith (44), 47 with Bernard (22) for the fifth wicket and 64 for the sixth wicket with Lewis, who smashed 22 off 19 balls, with the help of two sixes
