<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 29 (bdnews24.com)The government is set to expand the number of state-owned Krishi Bank branches across the country, in a bid to spur growth in the agricultural sector, the finance minister said on Wednesday. "Many unions have no branches of the Krishi Bank. We plan to extend the service to 1,000 additional unions across the country," AMA Muhith said at the launching ceremony of Bangladesh Krishi Bank's annual conference at the Shooting Federation in Gulshan. Bangladesh has some 4,500 unions in total. Muhith said the development of rural areas was hampered by the dearth of banks operating outside of town centres. He asked the bank, which specialises in the agricultural sector, to ensure personal deposits made by account holders living in rural areas was reinvested in the sector to promote development outside of the main population centres. "The Krishi Bank needs many more branches to develop the agricultural sector and ensure farmers get the optimum services," said Muhith. He said the bank's widespread rural presence meant it had a vital role to play in quickly disbursing remittances to farmers. "However, a big problem remains the lack of digitalisation in the rural banking system," he said. According to the Krishi Bank, it currently has 952 branches in five divisions, and the Rajshahi Krishi Unnayan Bank has 364 branches in Rajshahi Division. Also attending the conference were Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman, Krishi Bank chairman Khondaker Ibrahim Khaled, Bangladesh Economic Association general-secretary Abul Barakat and Krishi Bank director general Mokhter Hossain. bdnews24
