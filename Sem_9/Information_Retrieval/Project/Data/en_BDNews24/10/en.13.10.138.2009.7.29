 Dhaka, July 29 (bdnews24.com)  Social welfare minister Enamul Haq Mostafa Shahid has asked the deputy commissioners to be watchful so that no militant organisation or fundamentalism can operate under the guise of or backed by non-governmental organisations. "The government is taking measures to prevent any fraud, corruption or irregularities committed in the name of NGOs," the social welfare minister told the DCs on Wednesday, the second day of the three-day council of deputy commissioners. "Action will be taken against fake and ineffective NGOs run only to serve selfish or parochial motives," Shahid said. He said all NGOs would be brought under one umbrella for better coordination and control. NGOs are currently registered with the the social welfare ministry, women and children affairs ministry, Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and NGO Bureau. He said the government will form a social security council for handling registration, monitoring and cancellation of registration of all NGOs. Various banks including the Bangladesh Bank will be involved with monitoring financial activities of NGOs to prevent misuse of foreign funds, Shahid said. The government in April formed a committee vesting it with the responsibility of drawing a long list of weak and ineffective NGOs. Asked if the list was made, the minister said work on the list was in the final stage and the officials concerned will submit it as soon as they are done. The government will then launch corrective actions, he said. b
