 DAMBULLA, Sri Lanka, 29 July (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka have called up pace bowler Dilhara Fernando into an expanded 16-man squad for their five-match one-day series against Pakistan, which starts on Thursday. Fernando, 30, will provide strike bowling cover for Lasith Malinga, who is returning to one-day cricket after a year's absence and may not play in all the matches due to a congested schedule. A new-look Sri Lanka side will line up in Kumar Sangakkara's first one-day series as captain. "It's a fresh start with some new combinations," Sangakkara told reporters after Sri Lanka's final practice on Wednesday. "We have had some new players coming in and a lot of re-grouping to do after the test series," he added. "We've done a bit of work on individual skills and technique but we've focused on working out the specific roles for each individual. Once every player knows what his role is it becomes a lot easier." Sri Lanka won the test series against Pakistan 2-0. Sri Lanka squad: Kumar Sangakkara (captain), Muttiah Muralitharan, Sanath Jayasuriya, Mahela Jayawardene, Upul Tharanga, Thilan Samaraweera, Chamara Kapugedera, Thilina Kandamby, Angelo Mathews, Isuru Udana, Ajantha Mendis, Lasith Malinga, Thilan Thushara, Nuwan Kulasekara, Malinga Bandara and Dilhara Fernando.
