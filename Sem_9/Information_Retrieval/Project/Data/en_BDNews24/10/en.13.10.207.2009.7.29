 Dhaka, July 28 (bdnews24.com)Pradeep Chowdhury usually goes out news hunting every morning riding his motorcycle. On Tuesday morning, the bdnews24.com journalist left his Bajaj Platinum at home in Modhyo Paikparha in Mirpur and instead, hired a small country boat with four others. It took him three and a half hours to reach Bangladesh Secretariat. Under the influence of a low in the Bay, heavy downpour starting Monday evening and continuing overnight has inundated most areas of the city with water sneaking its way into houses and shops. Chowdhury said the street adjacent to his house had gone under five feet-deep water. "I was surprised to see boats plying the streets in front of my house when I woke up in the [Tuesday] morning," he said. The boatmen were charging Tk 10 for 600 to 900 feet distance. After reaching the Ansar camp bus stand at around 9:30am Chowdhury found it teeming with commuters with no buses in sight. Some buses were detouring through this way because of water on the road from Mirpur 10 to Rokeya Sarani but those were packed like sardines. Abandoning the hope of getting any vehicle, Chowdhury, like many other commuters, hit the street on foot. "From the roundabout of technical college I got some space in the foot board of a bus and reached Press Club dangling like a bat for two and a half hours," he said. Rakibul Bashar, a resident of West Shorapara, found himself sleeping on a bedraggled mattress on a floor with inch-deep water at around 5am. Hearing calls from neighbours he opened the door, ushering a gush of water into the room that drenched his books, rice sacks and bags before he could stash those safely. "I found waist-deep water on the street in front of my house when I went out at around seven in the morning," he said. Jhuma Chowdhury, a resident of Paikpara, sloshed through knee-high water when he got down from his bed at around 3am. He found his wardrobes soaked and open. "When I went out to look for bricks to elevate the bed I found the water at chest-deep level," he said. bd
