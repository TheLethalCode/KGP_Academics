 Dhaka, July 30 (bdnews24.com)  A four-day Asia-Pacific workshop, just concluded in Dhaka on Thursday, highlighted the vast untapped potential lying in the region's aggregate foreign exchange reserves, amounting to $4 trillion. The workshop, jointly hosted by the Bangladesh Bank and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP), also discussed the possibility of building a regional economic union and introducing a common currency. "The region's countries hold a record quantity of foreign reserves amounting to around four trillion dollars in all," Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman said after Thursday's conclusion of the workshop. "This huge regional asset can be used to improve our trade, our businesses and investment," Rahman said at a press briefing on the workshop, held from July 27-30, at the Pan Pacific Sonargaon Hotel in Dhaka. "Not all countries in the region are equal, some are small and some big. The use of common reserves will aim at cutting disparity," he added. The Bangladesh Bank governor and ESCAP director Nagesh Kumar inaugurated the regional workshop last Monday. It was attended over four days by delegates from Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, the Maldives, Nepal, China, Cambodia, Malaysia, Fiji, the Philippines, Korea, Russia, Thailand, Vietnam and Laos. Representatives from UNDP, World Bank, IMF, ADB and a number of other local and international organisations also attended. Opinions elicited from the workshop will be raised in a meeting of ESCAP members on aggregate economic policy, poverty and development in November this year and will again be tabled as a report at ESCAP's annual assembly in 2010. "Our dream is to build up a strong regional economic unit in the Asia-Pacific region. We have been discussing how to realise the goal," Rahman told the briefing at the wrap-up of the workshop on Thursday. The Bangladesh Bank governor said participants had also remarked that the host country was one of the least affected by the global recession. "The world recession impacted less on Asian countries and Bangladesh faced less fallout than most," Rahman said. Bangladesh has been cushioned so far as it has adopted few external policies, but focused on internal economic activities, he said. "It is not enough to focus only on the expansion of exports to face the crisis. We have two walk on two feet. Along with expanding exports, we have to focus on our agriculture and SME sectors to brace up our economy." Rahman said bracing internal sectors was also a poverty reduction measure. Economic advisor at Bangladesh Bank Habibullah Bahar presented highlights of the workshop in a written statement. "Poverty has to be reduced and new consumers created by strengthening domestic markets. Besides, surplus quantities of huge foreign currency reserves can be used to form a regional fund to increase investment activities in the region." "Such a fund will play a helpful role to raise aggregate domestic demand. Side by side, it will be a support for poorer countries." Bangladesh Bank recently announced a provision to use its surplus foreign reserves to boost internal investment. bd
