 Dhaka, July 29 (bdnews24.com)Construction costs for the planned Padma Bridge at Mawa are now estimated at $1.9 billion, a quarter of which the government plans to finance by issuing bonds, finance minister AMA Muhith said on Wednesday. Muhith said funding was largely in place for the huge engineering project and construction was scheduled to begin early next year. "Hopefully the bridge will be completed within the tenure of the current administration," said Muhith following an inter-cabinet meeting on World Bank funded projects at the secretariat. He said the project would be part-financed by the Asian Development Bank, World Bank and Islamic Development Bank in the form of loan-assistance. A deficit of around $500 million is likely to be sourced by issuing government bonds for both local and non-resident Bangladeshis, said Muhith. "However, a final decision on the bonds issue will be reached at a cabinet meeting," he said. He said all preliminary work, including funding by development partners, land acquisition and a finalised design would be completed by this August. "International tenders will then be floated," he said. Muhith said the government was mulling two different designs for the planned bridge: "One design is for a concrete bridge and the other is a steel bridge." He said costs for the concrete bridge were slightly higher than for the steel bridge, although both would include a rail line. The ADB will be the major provider of funds, said Muhith. "Construction of the Padma Bridge was an important part of our election manifesto and we are very keen to see its speedy implementation," said the finance minister. According to the communications ministry, the cost of the bridge was initially estimated at $1.2 billion, although the estimated costs climbed over the tenure of the caretaker administration. Lead donor ADB will provide $350 million in loan assistance, while the WB will supply $300 million and the IDB $150 million, according to the communications ministry. "There will be no problem with funding, no matter what the project costs," said Muhith. bdnews
