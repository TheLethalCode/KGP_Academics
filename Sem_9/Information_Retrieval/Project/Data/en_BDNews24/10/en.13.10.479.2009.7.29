 MADRID, July 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cristiano Ronaldo scored his first goal for Real Madrid netting the opener from the penalty spot in a 4-2 friendly win over Ecuador's Liga de Quito at the Bernabeu on Tuesday. The Portuguese winger, signed from Manchester United for 80 million pounds last month, sent the goalkeeper the wrong way after being tripped as he dribbled into the area in the 48th minute. Christoph Metzelder and returning former youth team players Esteban Granero and Alvaro Negredo added the other goals for Real as they booked a Peace Cup semi-final encounter with Juventus on Friday.
