 Dhaka, July 28 (bdnews24.com)The government is planning to invite Bangladesh's 79 honorary consuls general to Dhaka in a bid to increase their knowledge of the country and facilitate economic growth. The foreign ministry will request honorary consuls general, based in 79 cities of 54 countries, to visit Bangladesh in line with a recommendation of the parliamentary standing committee on the foreign ministry. AH Mahmood Ali, chairman of the standing committee, said the committee had recommended the ministry invite the unpaid officials, commonly nationals of the country in which they are based, to familiarise them with the Bangladesh's potential and better promote its interests. "There are many honorary consuls who have never visited Bangladesh and know very little about the country," he told reporters after a meeting on Tuesday at the parliament building. "How then are they to promote Bangladesh?" Ali, a former ambassador, said the main focus of foreign missions was "economic diplomacy". "This initiative will help the consuls to learn about Bangladeshi products, which will increase exports," said Ali. The government nominates honorary consuls general for cities without any Bangladeshi mission. Foreign minister Dipu Moni and state minister for foreign affairs Hasan Mahmud also attended Tuesday's meeting
