 TEHRAN, Jul 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has ordered the closure of Kahrizak detention center where some reformist detainees are believed to have been held. The semi-official Mehr news agency quoted lawmaker Kazem Jalali as saying the detention center was ordered closed because it lacked standards to preserve the "rights of detainees." Some reformist websites have reported some detainees involved in protests following the disputed June 12 presidential election were being held at Kahrizak. "Kahrizak is the detention center which the leader ordered closed because it lacked necessary conditions to preserve rights of detainees," said Jalali, spokesman of a special parliamentary committee set up to investigate detentions after the election. Jalali said Tehran's Evin prison, where many political prisoners are held, will be visited by members of the committee on Tuesday. "We are unlikely to visit Kahrazik because it has been closed," he said. It was not clear if detainees at the facility had been released or transferred to another detention center. Moderate defeated candidates Mirhossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karoubi have called on the authorities to permit a gathering on Thursday at Tehran's "Grand Mosala," a prayer location where tens of thousands can gather, to commemorate unrest victims. The presidential vote plunged Iran into its biggest internal crisis since the 1979 Islamic revolution and exposed deepening divisions in its ruling elite. Rights groups say hundreds of people, including senior pro- reform politicians, journalists, activists and lawyers, have been detained in Iran since the election, which moderates say was rigged in favor of hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Iranian media have reported several protesters' deaths following the vote.
