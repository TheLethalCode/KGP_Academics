 MUMBAI, Jul 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A special court on Monday found three people guilty of planning serial blasts in the financial hub of Mumbai in 2003 which were blamed on the Pakistan-based militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LET). The three -- Ashrat Ansari, Mohammad Hanif and his wife Fehmida -- were convicted of plotting with LeT two coordinated blasts in Mumbai in August 2003 that killed more than 50 people and injured more than 200. "Today the LeT has suffered a big setback, as the special court in Mumbai has found all three accused guilty," Ujjwal Nikam, the public prosecutor told reporters. The sentencing in the case, which was tried in a special court under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, will take place on Aug. 4, Nikam said. The prosecution would demand the death penalty for all three. India also blames the LeT for the Nov. 26-29 attacks in Mumbai that killed at least 166 people last year.
