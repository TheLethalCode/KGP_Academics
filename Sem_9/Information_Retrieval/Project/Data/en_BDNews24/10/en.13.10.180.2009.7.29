<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 29 (bdnews24.com)Information minister Abul Kalam Azad called on journalists Wednesday to adhere to the highest ethical standards, citing cases of irresponsible reporting of February's BDR mutiny as a recent notable example. When the Pilkhana hostages emerged, reporters asked some of them whether they had been raped. Journalists must be more responsible," Azad told an audience at the 2009 ICRC-DRU Best Article Award. "When making such a query reporters must observe the highest ethics of journalism," said Azad. He said journalists had to rigorously check the authenticity of their reports, while bearing in mind the context of a news situation. Azad also pointed to recent rumours that surfaced in the media regarding possible new cabinet members, saying this too was a case where reporters had failed to check their sources. The awards ceremony was jointly organised by the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Dhaka Reporters Unity. Seven journalists received recognition for their work. They are Mahmud Roni (Azadi), Elita Karim (Daily Star), Jashim Uddin (Amar Desh), Parimal Palma (Daily Star), Pinaki Roy (Daily Star), Saiful Islam (New Nation) and Imran Hossain (Daily Star).
