 BIRMINGHAM, England, July 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia do not have the same aura about them as recent dominant teams from Down Under, England captain Andrew Strauss said on Wednesday. England lead the Ashes series 1-0 going into the third test at Edgbaston starting on Thursday and Strauss said the Australians were not as intimidating as they once were. "I don't think this Australia side has an aura about them," Strauss told a news conference. "The aura came from guys like (Shane) Warne, (Glenn) McGrath, (Matthew) Hayden and (Adam) Gilchrist. "A lot of their players are just starting their test careers and it feels like you are playing against any other test team." Australia captain Ricky Ponting played down the significance of the comments. "Aura is built up over a long period of time," he said. "Results change the aura of a side and it's about executing your plans and skills to a high level. "That is what some of our former players were so good at doing and why they won a lot of test matches." England will be without their leading batsman Kevin Pietersen through injury. "You always miss players of that quality but I am very confident that Ian Bell will come back and play very well," Strauss said. MODEST RECORD Bell, however, has a modest record against Australia and Ponting said they would be targeting him. "We do feel their batting is weakened without Pietersen and it's our job to get the openers out early and to get into the middle-order quickly with a hard ball," he said. England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff is winning his fitness race following his inspirational bowling performance in the hosts' dramatic 115-run victory in the last test at Lord's. "He seems fine and has come through all the work-outs pretty well," Strauss said. "So barring anything happening overnight he should be ok and we are very optimistic." Spinner Monty Panesar has been released from the squad and England will make their final team selection in the morning with heavy rain forecast to disrupt the game. "It is a huge test match for both sides," Strauss said. "The Aussies will come back strong and will be motivated to raise their levels. "Generally, it was a very good team performance at Lord's but we can always improve." Ponting said he was pleased with the way his players had responded to the defeat. "I'm pretty happy with the way we're travelling," he said. "We know we were outplayed and for us it's all about righting the wrongs of Lord's
