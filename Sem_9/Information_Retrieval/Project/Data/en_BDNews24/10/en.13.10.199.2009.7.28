<TITLE> Clear choked canals for respite: expert </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 28 (bdnews24.com)--An water expert has put down the unprecedented flooding of Dhaka city after overnight rain on Tuesday to encroachment and choking of canals. Dr Ainun Nishat, country representative, IUCN-The World Conservation Union, Bangladesh told bdnews24.com that unless those canals are cleared of encroachers or re-excavated, the natural drainage system the city used to enjoy in the past is not going to be revived any more. Dhaka city has a very interesting topographical feature, he said. "If we think of a line starting at the Buriganga Bridge moving up through Jatrabari and connecting Sayedabad along the Bishwa Road to Malibagh and Rampura, from there to the Airport Road and Kuril and moving further up to Tongi Bridge, the line should be considered the spine of Dhaka city," said Nishat. "Let's imagine Dhaka as a turtle back shaped city and we'll see that its spinal plain slopes towards the east, west and the south. The western flank stands protected against flooding by an embankment, which interferes with the drainage system, if you get what I mean. "The main problem, however, cropped up when community people across the city meddled with and encroached upon the extensive canal network Dhaka used to boast once. "In some cases, the canals have been totally filled up. In other cases, some of the canals have almost choked." "They ought to deploy pumps which are effective too," he said. "Another thing is, the frequency and magnitude of this type of disasters will rise due to global warming and climate change, of which we are all aware by now." To undertake canal reclamation effectively, Dr Nishat said, it is important to review the institutional setup, as the canals belong to the land ministry, surface drainage responsibility lies with the city corporation and WASA stands responsible for managing the box sewerage line. "Keeping this box sewerage line operational is a specially difficult task," said Dr Nishat, "The whole drainage management system should be brought under a single management and command." "Otherwise Dhaka city will continue to suffer similar calamities as has been created [Tuesday]. The city's drainage should cease to be an everybody's baby and should rather be made a committed somebody's baby." bd
