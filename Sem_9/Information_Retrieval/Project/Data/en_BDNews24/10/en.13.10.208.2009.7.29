<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 29 (bdnews24.com)Anyone considering applying for overseas jobs should register with the Bureau of Manpower Employment and Training, overseas employment minister Khandker Musharraf Hossain said on Wednesday. Hossain said the new registration system would also establish a quota system in areas of the country that has previously sent disproportionate numbers of workers overseas. "The government has initiated the BMET registration system to protect potential overseas workers from fraudulent practices," Hossain told reporters after after the conclusion of the second day of a three-day council of deputy commissioners (DCs) in Dhaka. Hossain called on DCs, the country's district-level chief executives, to ensure proper registration of potential overseas workers in all districts. He said the government would contact individuals regarding their employment situation subsequent to registration. "If necessary, the scheme will set up quotas in areas where fewer workers are finding opportunities to go abroad," said Hossain. "The quota system will bring financial equilibrium to the county, alleviate poverty and promote more balanced development," he said. Hossain said the measures would reduce fraudulent practices in the future, but the government could do little for those who had already lost out to fraudulent manpower agencies and others. Also attending the council session at the Cabinet Division Conference Centre was foreign minister Dipu Moni and cabinet secretary Abdul Aziz. bdnew
