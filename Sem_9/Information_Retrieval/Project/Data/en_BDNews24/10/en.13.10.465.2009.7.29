 CHENNAI, India, July 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - West Indies fast bowler Kemar Roach and his team have been dealt misery on top of their one-day series loss to Bangladesh after being fined for breach of the International Cricket Council (ICC) code of conduct. Roach was docked 10 per cent of his match fee after he was charged for bowling two high, full-pitched deliveries at Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan in Tuesday's second one-dayer in Dominica, which the visitors won by three wickets. He was barred from bowling by the umpire after he bowled a second 'beamer' and was then summoned for a hearing before the ICC match referee Roshan Mahanama after the game. West Indies captain Floyd Reifer was handed an official reprimand for failing to ensure play was conducted within the spirit and laws of the game, an ICC release said on Wednesday. The hosts were also penalised for a slow over-rate. Skipper Reifer was fined 10 per cent of his match fee and his team mates five per cent of their fees for falling one over short of target in the stipulated time. Bangladesh recorded their first one-day series success over a current test-playing nation after securing a 2-0 lead with one match remaining. They also won the preceding test series, after West Indies were forced to field a weak side following a boycott by the main players due to a contract dispute with the cricket board.
