 Dhaka, July 27 (bdnews24.com) The Bangladesh cricket team will be looking to seal the three-match one-day international series with a game in hand when they take on hosts West Indies on Tuesday in Dominica. Fresh from their first-ever win in an ODI against the West Indies, by 52 runs at Windsor Park, the players are expected to take the form into the second match and back themselves for a first-ever ODI series triumph against a major Test-playing nation.

Riding on a superb batting performance from Mohammad Ashraful, stand-in-captain Shakib Al Hasan and Mahmdullah Riyad, Bangladesh posted their highest one-day total against West Indies on Sunday and the nation will be hoping to see another fine batting display from those batsmen in the second match. After his match-winning four-wicket haul, left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak will be once again on focus and he is expected to be more destructive against a side, which is traditionally weak playing spin. "I was out of the team for eight months and now I am back in the side and looking forward to do well," said Razzak after being named man of the match in the first one-dayer.
