 Dhaka, July 29 (bdnews24.com)--The Dhaka-Kolkata passenger trains schedule is changing from August 1 to make them more attractive to passengers, the railway officials said on Wednesday. According to the rescheduled timetable, the Maitree Express train will operate four days a week--Saturday, Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday--instead of only Saturday and Sunday. "The Indian train will come to Dhaka on Saturday and leave for Kolkata on Sunday," Quazi Asadullah, Bangladesh Railway's additional director general, told bdnews24.com. "The Bangladesh train will start for Kolkata on Tuesday and return the next day." He said as per the new decision of Bangladesh and Indian governments, the train travel will take 11 hours instead of 13 hours. Currently, a Bangladesh train heads for Kolkata on Saturday and returns on Sunday. An Indian train (Eastern Railway) leaves Kolkata for Dhaka on Saturday and go back on Sunday. "The previous timetable was not passenger-friendly. Because, if a passenger travelled by train, they must wait until next Saturday to return by train. "Therefore, some people had to get back by bus though they travelled by train," Asadullah said. The Maitree Express cannot lure in more passengers for its inconvenient timetable and lengthy customs and immigration formalities at the bordering Darsana in Bangladesh and Gede in India. Each station takes two and a half hours to complete the formalities. On average, 75 passengers travel by the train having 400-plus seats, according to the railway sources. "The two governments have also agreed to cut customs and immigration time by two hours. "From August 1, the train will reach destinations in 11 hours instead of 13 hours," said Asadullah. India's Eastern Railway train will start for Dhaka from Chitpur station at 7:10am (Indian time) and the Bangladesh train will leave Dhaka from Cantonment Station at 8:30am (Bangladesh time). Bangladesh and India on April 14 last year launched the Maitree trains to directly connect Dhaka and the West Bengal capital Kolkata. The service was snapped in 1965 when India and Pakistan fought a war. Then Bangladesh was a part of Pakistan. The rail distance between the two cities is 538 kilometres418 kilometres on Bangladesh and 120 kilometres on Indian side.
