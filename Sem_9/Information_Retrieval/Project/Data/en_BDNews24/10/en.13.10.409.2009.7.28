 LONDON, Tue Jul 28, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World stocks extended gains to fresh 9-month peaks on Tuesday while the dollar fell to a 2009 low after upbeat US data and optimism over corporate earnings prompted investors to add risky assets. US stocks rose on Monday after data showed home sales surged in June, a sign that the domestic housing market -- which led the world's biggest economy into recession -- may have hit bottom and is starting to rebound. More housing data is due later.

The dollar fell to its weakest level since December against a basket of major currencies while it hit eight-week lows of $1.4303 per euro. The Australian dollar hit a 2009 high against the dollar and government bonds fell after the country's central bank governor Glenn Stevens said risks to the economy were now more balanced and warned that low interest rates could merely inflate a new housing bu
