 UNITED NATIONS, Thu Jul 30,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on Wednesday he is willing to visit North Korea to defuse tensions over the communist country's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.

He also said he had made two previously undisclosed appeals to North Korea to release two US journalists it has held since March. Laura Ling and Euna Lee of the US media group Current TV were arrested near the China-North Korea border, convicted of "great crimes" and sentenced to 12 years hard labor.
