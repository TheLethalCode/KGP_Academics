<TITLE> IMF offering soft loan facility to Bangladesh: Muhith </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jul 29 (bdnews24.com)The International Monetary Fund is interested in offering Bangladesh a soft loan facility, designed for IMF members with good economic fundamentals, the finance minister said Wednesday. "The IMF usually gives hard loans (at prevailing market rates). Now they want to offer soft loans at 0.025 percent interest rate to Bangladesh," AMA Muhith told reporters after a meeting with IMF's visiting Asia-Pacific adviser Masato Miyazaki. "[Miyazaki] said IMF is interested to provide lower interest loans to Bangladesh as the country has a good reputation for repaying on time," said Muhith. But Bangladesh is not currently in need of the particular loan facility that is on offer, said Muhith. "IMF is offering the loans under their Poverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF); we need soft loans in the energy sector." He said such loans would be most useful in supporting various public and private sector gas and power projects. Muhith said the matter would be discussed further with IMF officials. Replying to queries from reporters, he said the IMF was not shutting down its Bangladesh office. A national daily reported recently that the multi-lateral lending agency was set to close its resident office in Dhaka.
