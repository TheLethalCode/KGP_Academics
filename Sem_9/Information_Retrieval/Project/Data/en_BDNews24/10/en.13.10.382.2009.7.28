 Dhaka, July 28 (bdnews24.com) - Dhaka, with its collapsing amenities and worsening drainage situation, was keeping afloat with difficulty as the overcrowded capital suffered severe flooding on Tuesday following torrential overnight rains. State minister for local government, Jahangir Kabir Nanak, after an emergency early morning meeting at Dhaka WASA Bhaban, expressed hope that the floodwaters inundating low-lying areas of the city would recede through the day. He said the Dhaka water authority had deployed a total of 250 pumps the capital to alleviate the water logging crisis that left half the city knee-to-waist deep in floods. Senior meteorologist in Dhaka, Zahid Hossain, said a record 338mm rainfall was recorded in Dhaka in the 24 hours up to 10am Tuesday, mostly falling in just twelve hours between 7pm and 7am. Offices, businesses and schools were off to a slow start in the morning as low-lying residential areas, commercial areas, shopping districts and markets across the city were inundated overnight. Road transport was out and rail services on the Dhaka-Narayanganj line also ground to a halt. The Bangladesh Secretariat office blocks were floating like islands in feet-deep water on Tuesday morning. Dhaka Stock Exchange was forced to delay start of trade by an hour. The rain had eased off by midmorning, but Hossain said the city was likely to see more rainfall through the day. He said the coastal districts have also been asked to keep hoisted local cautionary signal three till further notice. After weeks of dry weather during the peak monsoon months, bringing fears of drought for Aman farmers in the north, the central and southern regions was seeing some of the heaviest overnight rain of the year, the met office told bdnews24.com in the early hours. Nanak, speaking to reporters at WASA Bhaban at around 11am, said, "You will have noticed the waters have already receded a lot in the past hour." "In a few more hours, it should be much improved, excepting the low lying areas." "We sympathise with those who have been suffering immensely due to the heavy rains. All WASA officials have been combating the water logging across the city since early morning," said the junior minister. "This excessive rainfall is unnatural," said Nanak. "On September 13 in 2004, the weather office recorded an amazing 341 mm rainfall, I remember. Dhaka city then had to suffer stagnant floodwaters through a long spell of nine days. Dhaka brought to a standstill The overnight downpour brought Dhaka to a standstill, with vehicles stuck on the flooded roads and people trapped in homes as low-lying areas went underwater. Boats were seen plying the some of the worst-hit areas in the morning. Bashabo, Mugda, Meradia, Maghbazaar, Mouchak, Mohammadpur, Shantinagar, Mirpur, and parts of Old Dhaka city faced the most severe water logging. Many major roads and junctions were unpassable and residents of vulnerable areas were seen pumping or bailing water out of their houses through the night and into the morning. bdnews24.com correspondents had reported sections of Mirpur Road, Bijoy Sharani, Shantinagar, Kaziparha, Shyaorhaparha, Dhanmondi and Lamatia under knee to waist deep water from midnight. Cars, three-wheelers and other motorised vehicles were seen abandoned in the flood waters through the night as their engines gave out in the rain. Jahangir Hossain, a CNG autorickshaw driver, told bdnews24.com that his engine stopped at least five times between Dhanmondi and Mirpur in the early hours. At the intersection of Dhanmondi's Road 27 and Mirpur Road, one bdnews24.com correspondent on his way to work in a rickshaw could hardly keep his trousers dry at noon Tuesday, as vehicles were still struggling through waist-deep water. bdn
