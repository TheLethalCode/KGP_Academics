 TEHRAN, Jul 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The prominent Iranian disabled reformer Saeed Hajjarian will be released on Wednesday after being held since the disputed presidential election, Iranian media reported, quoting a judiciary spokesman. "Political activist Hajjarian, who was arrested in post-election unrest, will be released today ... his release takes place based on recent orders by the judiciary chief," the students' news agency quoted the spokesman as saying. Iran's top judge, Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi-Shahroudi, ordered the judiciary on Monday to re-examine the cases of moderate detainees in a week. Hajjarian's lawyer told Isna he had not been released yet. Hajjarian is an ally of moderate presidential candidate Mirhossein Mousavi, who has formally appealed against the result of the June 12 election, which defeated moderates say was rigged in favor of hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has endorsed AHmadinejad's re-election. The vote plunged Iran into its biggest internal crisis since the 1979 Islamic revolution and exposed deepening divisions in its ruling elite
