 BIRMINGHAM, England, July 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Heavy rain left the Edgbaston outfield covered in pools of water on Wednesday, just one day before the start of the third Ashes Test between England and Australia. Ground staff worked all morning to clear the deluge but both teams were forced into the indoor cricket school for their final practice sessions. Rain was also forecast to disrupt the first few days of the match. "I'm more concerned about the rain," Australia captain Ricky Ponting told reporters when asked if he was happy with his team's preparations following their defeat in the second test at Lord's. "I am actually a bit surprised that the wicket itself is so dry but there's plenty of rain around still," Ponting added. "I think spin will play a part in the match." The 2005 Edgbaston Ashes Test was a thrilling match which England won by two runs to level the series after Australia's last two wickets added 104 runs. "The last half hour was horrific, incredibly tense," England captain Andrew Strauss said. "There was a sense that things were not going our way and we were facing a pretty humiliating defeat," he added. "The feeling when we got the last wicket was pure relief."
