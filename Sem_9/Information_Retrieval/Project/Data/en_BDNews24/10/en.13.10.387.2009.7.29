 Dhaka, July 29 (bdnews24.com)  Tests have confirmed the presence of the toxic chemical, diethylene glycol, in a paracetamol syrup made by Rid Pharmaceutical Company suspected of killing 25 children in Bangladesh, health minister AFM Ruhal Haque said on Wednesday. He also said the company had no license to manufacture the paracetamol syrup. Diethylene glycol, normally used in the textile and leather dying industries, was used in the preparation of the paracetamol product as a cheap but deadly substitute for propylene glycol, Haque told a press briefing after a government probe committee submitted its report to the health ministry. Prof Abu Sara Shamsur Rouf, of Dhaka University's pharmaceutical technology department, had earlier told bdnews24.com that unscrupulous drug makers have been known to use ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol as a solvent in certain paracetamol preparations instead of the approved propylene glycol. "These chemicals are cheaper, and smaller amounts of them are required to perform the same task," said Rouf. He said chemical vendors may also adulterate propylene glycol with the more toxic compounds to increase their profit margins. "But it is possible for drug manufacturers to determine whether propylene glycol has been adulterated prior to the manufacturing process." 'No clearance' The health minister, briefing reporters at the ministry on Wednesday, said Rid Pharma had no clearance to manufacture the paracetamol syrup. Rid Pharma had initially denied producing the "paracetamol syrup" that was first linked to children's deaths in media reports. Officials of the drug company were quoted in the press as saying Rid Pharma "does not produce paracetamol syrup, only suspension". The health minister said Wednesday: "The product was described as a suspension on the package. But, it contained a syrup." Only five domestic companiesout of more than 250 big and small drug makers in the countryhave clearance to manufacture paracetamol syrup, Haque said. "Paracetamol is not injurious to health, but the diethyl glycol which the Rid Company's paracetamol syrup contains is injurious," he said. The toxic chemical was found in samples of the paracetamol product collected from Araihajar in Narayanganj, where children have died, the minister said. He also said the Directorate of Drug Administration will take further steps against the company. The Drug Administration, on July 21, ordered Rid Pharma to stop production of all products, including the paracetamol preparation that was suspected of causing kidney failure and deaths of at least 25 children in Dhaka since the start of June. The government formed the seven-member investigation committee on the same day to look into the cause of the deaths. Two days later, the parliamentary standing committee on health formed a separate four-member parliamentary committee to look into the manufacturing processes of pharmaceutical companies across the country. bd
