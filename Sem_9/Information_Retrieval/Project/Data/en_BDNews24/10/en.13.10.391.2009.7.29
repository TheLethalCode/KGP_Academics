 BAZARAK, Afghanistan, Jul 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah returned to his home turf on Tuesday to seek support in next month's election from the former resistance fighters he once helped to lead. Under confetti and glitter, about 1,500 of Abdullah's supporters flocked to see him on a river bank in Panjshir in Afghanistan's east, a lush valley flanked by imposing mountains. Abdullah was carried by a crowd who chanted his name, and that of their fallen leader Ahmed Shah Masood, the charismatic guerrilla who fought Soviet troops and the Taliban and was ordained a national hero by the government. "Panjshir is ... where I spent most of my life during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan as well as during the resistance. I know most of the people here, I know them personally," Abdullah told Reuters after the rally. He said the Panjshir was long a focal point of resistance for mujahideen, against occupying Soviet troops and the Taliban who soon replaced them until they were driven out in 2001. But Abdullah is not the only candidate in the Aug. 20 presidential poll battling for the support of the mujahideen. President Hamid Karzai has chosen as one of his two vice-presidential running mates Mohammad Qasim Fahim, who led U.S.-backed Afghan forces in toppling the Taliban. BATTLING FOR SUPPORT Like Abdullah, Fahim, an ethnic Tajik, also has a strong support base in Panjshir. Abdullah's background is split between Tajik and Pashtun, the majority ethnic grouping in Afghanistan. Fahim's choice by Karzai has been described by some analysts as an attempt to win over ethnic Tajiks who make up the majority in Panjshir, and to split Abdullah's vote. Abdullah shrugged off such concerns. "There were all sorts of speculations about Panjshir but I am confident," Abdullah said. "There were some views that because Fahim has been supporting President Karzai so my support base in Panjshir might weaken, but the support here is overwhelming," he said. Abdullah said Karzai was unable to rally the same support in Panjshir and was losing his edge in the election. Many observers still see Karzai as a clear front-runner ahead of Abdullah and former finance minister Ashraf Ghani among 38 challengers. "If he can create that much sentiment like I did ... I would consider him winning, but he has lost it. He has lost the people," he said of Karzai, who he served as foreign minister. Abdullah is respected for his close ties to Masood, who was assassinated by al Qaeda agents days before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States that precipitated the Afghan
