<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 28 (bdnews24.com)Deputy commissioners throughout the country have finalised lists of vested properties, and the government will finally settle the repeal or amendment of the Vested Properties Act by the end of this year, land minister Rezaul Karim said Tuesday. Karim said, "The vested property issue will come to a close in Bangladesh after 37 years of independence. We'll have the list from the DCs soon. Necessary amendments can be made by December, which will not leave any further complications." The controversial law was first introduced as the Enemy Property Act by the Pakistan government in the 1960s to confiscate property from individuals it deemed as an enemy of the state, in particular the property of Hindus who left Pakistan and settled in India after partition in 1947. After independence, despite calls to repeal the law, it was renamed the Vested and Non-Resident Property (Administration) Act in 1974, and is still in force to date giving the state the power to deprive a Bangladeshi citizen of his/her property The law has been criticised in Bangladesh and abroad as a major violation of the rights of citizens, especially minorities, who have had property seized simply on leaving the country. The previous Awami League government in 2001, just before its exit from power, tabled a new law, the Vested Property Return Act, fixing a 180-day time limit to prepare a list of properly documented vested property in order to take steps to restore falsely seized lands. But the BNP government by the end of 2001 had amended the bill replacing the 180-day deadline with an 'indefinite period'. The list was never completed. A parliamentary watchdog on March 11 this year asked the land ministry to draft a new bill to set a six-month deadline for local authorities to compile a list of land seized under the law. The land minister was in a discussion with the DCs in the third session of the first day of a three-day council of deputy commissioners on Tuesday. He told reporters after the meeting that the ministry would vet the DC's lists and publish a gazette very soon.

The DCs asked for filling of local administrative positions that were lying vacant, setting up and renovating land offices, easing collection of revenue, leasing, managing Khas land, and urged immediate steps for resolving land disputes in the hill tracts. The meeting was headed by the cabinet secretary Abdul Aziz, where forest and environment minister Mostafizar Rahman Fizar, secretary Mihir Kanti Majumder, land secretary Ehsan-ul-Fattah were also present. bd
