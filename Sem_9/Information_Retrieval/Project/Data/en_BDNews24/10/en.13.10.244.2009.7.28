 Dhaka, Jul 28 (bdnews24.com)Record overnight rains that left the city paralysed also had a grip on the country's premier bourse, causing sluggish trade during curtailed hours. The Dhaka Stock Exchange in the city's Motijheel commercial area was inundated by knee-deep water with elevators going out of order. "Start of trade was delayed by an hour as people were unable to reach here due to the floods. Trading started at 11am instead of 10am and closed at the usual time 2pm," DSE spokesperson Shafiqul Islam told bdnews24.com. Trading was very low Tuesday with the turnover reaching just Tk 3.79 billion with some 28 million shares changing hands. "Trading was at its lowest ebb; today's volume was less than 30 percent of the average daily trading volume," an official of brokerage firm Latif Securities told bdnews24.com. Officials in most brokerage house, especially the smaller ones, were seen sitting idle. "None of our clients placed any order till now," an official of Royal Securities said near end of trade. More or less the same was seen in larger brokerage firms. The trading floor at Lanka Bangla Securities was almost empty. An official of the firm said that they were getting orders by phone from their clients. "But business is not good today." Scrips though saw a hike as gainers outnumbered losers by 182 to 49. Experts said the bearish trend was quite expected "I was sure of low trading when I found the city drowned by last night's heavy rain fall," said former DSE chief executive Salahuddin Ahmed Khan. "Investors went for buying in the wake of low prices," said investment consultant Bashir Ahmed. The day saw fewer investors in the market which caused prices to be low in the opening hours, he added.
