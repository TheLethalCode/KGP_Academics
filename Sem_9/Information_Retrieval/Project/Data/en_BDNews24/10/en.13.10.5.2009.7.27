 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, July 27 (bdnews24.com)The number of marks allocated for the oral examination for the post of sub-inspector of police should be halved, a parliamentary committee tasked with finding ways to modernise the police has recommended. "Scope for nepotism and political interference rise when the amount of marks allocated to the oral examination is higher," Mujibul Huq Channu, chairman of the three-member sub-committee, told bdnews24.com Monday. Another member of the committee told bdnews24.com that every year a corrupt syndicate became active over the appointment of sub-inspectors of police. "Board members can easily influence the results by giving preferred candidates more marks in the oral exam, where other candidates fared better in the written test," he said. The five-member recruitment board consists of an additional inspector-general or deputy inspector-general, two superintendents of police and two officials of the home ministry. "The committee will suggest reducing the number of marks allocated in the oral test to 50, from the current 100," said Channu, after a meeting at the parliament building. The parliamentary standing committee on home ministry formed the sub-committee last month to report on ways to modernise the police force and minimise political interference, nepotism and corruption. Awami League MPs Nurul Islam Sujon and Shafiqul Islam form the other members of the team; they will submit their report to main committee for final recommendations. Currently, the Police Headquarters invites applications to the post of sub-inspector once a year. Half of the vacant posts are filled by internal promotion and the remainder by external appointees. Applicants are required to sit written examinations on a number of subjects in addition to the oral exam
