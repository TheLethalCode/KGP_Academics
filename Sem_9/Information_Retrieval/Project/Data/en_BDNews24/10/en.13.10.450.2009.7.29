 Dhaka, July 29 (bdnews24.com)A 'Dhaka Declaration' on climate change has called for at least $150 billion a year to be made available by developed nations to avert environmental disasters in the most vulnerable countries of the world. The declaration was issued by the International Civil Society Conference on the Rights of the Most Vulnerable Countries in Climate Negotiations at the close of three-day talks at the Dhaka Sheraton. It also called on developed countries to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by at least 45 percent in aggregate against 1990 levels by 2020. "We call on all parties of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to recognise the most vulnerable countries (MVCs) as a collective voice in climate negotiations," said the declaration. "Adapting to climate change is not a choice, it is a necessity," it said. Ziaul Hoque Mukta said of the $150 billion a year requested for MVCs, $50 billion a year should be targeted for adaptation projects in the most vulnerable countries and should not take the form of loans. Dr Saleemul Huq, senior fellow of UK based Institute for Environment and Development, said civil society in vulnerable countries had to ensure their own governments struck the best deal in the upcoming climate meet in Copenhagen. "We need to provide assistance. What is not yet agreed is how much money is involved, figures range from $50 billion to $100 billion," said Huq. The conference was jointly organised by the Campaign for Sustainable Rural Livelihoods and Oxfam ahead of the UN climate conference in Copenhagen at the end of the year. It was attended by representative from the Maldives, Nepal, Bhutan, Vietnam, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Uganda, Lesotho, Swaziland, Zambia, Niger, Tanzania, Samoa, Thailand, Sri Lanka and the Philippines
