 BISHKEK, Jul 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police in Kyrgyzstan detained dozens of opposition activists Wednesday after they staged a march through the capital Bishkek in protest at last week's presidential election. Russia and United States are worried that opposition anger over the July 23 vote could spill over into broader unrest in the small ex-Soviet republic in Central Asia, where both maintain military airbases. Official results gave incumbent President Kurmanbek Bakiyev with 76 percent of the vote. Opposition challenger Almazbek Atambayev got 8 percent and said the election was fraudulent. Waving flags and shouting "Justice!," 50 protesters marched through Bishkek but were swiftly intercepted by the police who blocked their path and snatched away their banners. After a scuffle, police detained most of the protesters. "They (activists) broke public security rules," Gulya Kozhokulova, a district prosecutor, told reporters. "Police acted in line with the law." The opposition has said it will stage more protests across the Muslim nation ahead of an informal summit of a Russia-dominated security bloc in Kyrgyzstan Friday, due to be attended by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. The opposition has threatened to block roads in the resort in east Kyrgyzstan where the meeting is due to take place. The ex-Soviet republic lies in the center of Russia-US rivalry in the vast energy-rich region stretching between Afghanistan, Iran, China and Russia. Its stability is key to efforts to contain violence in Afghanistan and block it from spilling over into the region. Seeking to offset US policy in the region, Russia wants to set up a second military hub in Kyrgyzstan's south -- an area where the government says Islamist militants are on the rise. In a move that has galvanized the opposition, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has also criticized the vote, saying its monitors witnessed widespread cases of ballot box stuffing and multiple voting. Kyrgyzstan has rejected all criticism, saying the vote was fair. In a post-election speech Tuesday, Bakiyev promised to work hard to bring more reform and promote democracy
