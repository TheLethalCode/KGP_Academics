 Dhaka, July 27 (bdnews24.com)A total of 29 out of the 39 registered parties have so far submitted fully amended and ratified constitutions, including ruling Awami League, and four more have asked that their earlier drafts be accepted as final, an official of the Election Commission said Monday. Election commissioner Sohul Hussain said, "We haven't yet inspected the submitted constitutions, but they will be given back for correction if any contradiction is found with electoral law." Deputy secretary of the EC Jasmine Tuli told bdnews24.com that BNP and five other parties have formally requested an extension to the deadline for submission of their permanent constitutions. Thirty-nine political parties were provisionally registered with the Election Commission, under the past caretaker government in line with new electoral laws, ahead of the Dec 29 2008 election, accepting draft constitutions on condition that they would later ensure full compliance with the Representation of the People Order amended to ensure greater democratic practice within parties. The EC gave them until July 25six months from the convening of the new parliamentto submit permanent constitutions fully amended in line with the electoral law and ratified through party councils or other democratic process. Those that have complied so far are: Awami League, Bangladesh Jatiya Party, Jatiya Party (Ershad), Jatiya Party (Manju), Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, Bangladesh Islami Front, Islamic Front Bangladesh, Jomiyate Ulamaye Islam Bangladesh, Islami Andolon Bangladesh, Bikalpadhara Bangladesh, Liberal Democratic Party-LDP, Jatiya Somajtantrik Dal-JSD, Jatiya Somajtantrik Dal-Jasod, Gono Forum, Gonotontri Party, Jatiya Gonotantrik Party-JAGPA, Bangladesh National Awami Party, Bangladesh National Awami Party-Bangladesh NAP, Bangladesh Torikot Federation, Bangladesh Khelafat Mojlish, Khelafat Mojlish, Communist Party of Bangladesh, Bangladesher Biplobi Workers' Party, National People's Party-NPP, Bangladesh Muslim League, Bangladesher Sammobadi Dal (ML), Bangladesh Kallyan Party, Bangladesh Islami Oikkojote and Bangladesh Khelafat Andolon. Gono Front, Oikkyoboddho Nagorik Andolon, Progressive Democratic Party and Workers' Party have requested the EC to accept their earlier submitted draft constitution as the amended one. Their request is under scrutiny, EC officials said. Bangladesh Nationalist Party, Krishak Sramik Janata League, Zaker Party, Freedom Party, Bangladesh Jatiya Party and Bangladesh Samajtantrik Dal-Basod have requested more time. The Election Commission has said it will extend the deadline by another six months to Jan 25 next year, pending amendment of electoral laws. The Awami League government has said it would like to see all political parties completing the registration process with the Election Commission. bdn
