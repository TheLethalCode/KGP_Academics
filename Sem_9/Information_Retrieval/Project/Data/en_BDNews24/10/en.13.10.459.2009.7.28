<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 28 (bdnews24.com)Travis Dowlin struck maiden century to power West Indies to 274-6 against Bangladesh in the second match at Windsor Park, Roseau, in Dominica on Tuesday. Dowlin, batting at number four, negotiated the Bangladeshi spinners to reach exact 100 not out and played three significant partnerships with Devon Smith, Dave Bernard and Rawl Lewis. Bangladesh now face an uphill task to wrap up the series with a match in hand, having never chased such total to win a match. Their highest successful chase was 249 against Australia in Cardiff in 2005. Bangladesh had a terrible time fielding, spilling runs and a catch and missing two run-out chances. Right-handed Dowlin got off to a sedate start to make 50 off 88 balls with a boundary. But the 32-year-old batsman got more adventurous to reach hundred consuming only 29 balls that included another five boundaries and one six. Dowlin cover-drove pacer Syed Rasel in the final over to reach 100 off 117 balls and added 66 runs for the third wicket with Devon Smith (44), 47 with Bernard (22) for the fifth wicket and 64 for the sixth wicket with Lewis, who smashed 22 off 19 balls, with the help of two sixes. Opting to bat first, openers Dale Richards and Andre Fletcher gave the hosts a steady start making 20 and 22 respectively before Smith and Dowlin took charge. They kept the spinners, who played the key role in Tests and one-dayers, at bay. West Indies picked up 50 runs losing one wicket in the third powerplay taken by the batsmen and racked up another 48 runs in the last five overs and overall added 98 runs in the last 10 overs. Syed Rasel, Abdur Razzak, Shakib Al Hasan and Naeem Islam took one wicket apiece. Bangladesh made no changes to their squad that defeated the hosts by 52 runs in the three ODIs series opener. West Indies brought two changes to the playing eleven with wicketkeeper Devon Thomas coming in for Nikita Miller and Gavin Tonge replaced Nelon Pascal. Bangladesh: Tamim Iqbal, Junaed Siddique, Mohammad Ashraful, Raqibul Hasan, Shakib Al Hasan, Mahmudullah Riyad, Mushfiqur Rahim, Naeem Islam, Abdur Razzak, Syed Rasel and Rubel Hossain. West Indies: Devon Smith, Dale Richards, Travis Dowlin, Floyd Reifer, Dave Bernard, Darren Sammy, Devon Thomas, Andre Fletcher, Rawl Lewis, Kemar Roach and Gavin Tonge.
