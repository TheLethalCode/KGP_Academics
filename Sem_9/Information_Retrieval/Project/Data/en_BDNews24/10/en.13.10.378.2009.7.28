 Dhaka, July 28 (bdnews24.com)  Torrential overnight rains brought Dhaka to a standstill Tuesday morning, with vehicles stuck on the flooded roads and people trapped in homes as low-lying areas of the city were inundated. The met office told bdnews24.com that 333mm of rainfall were recorded in the twelve hours up to 7am in Dhaka, though the rain had eased off by mid-morning. State minister for local government, Jahangir Kabir Nanak, was in an emergency meeting with the Dhaka WASA chief "at the prime minister's orders", a spokesperson for the state minister told bdnews24.com in the morning. Dhaka Stock Exchange was forced to delay start of trade by an hour. "People were unable to reach here," said DSE spokesperson Shafiqul Islam. He said trading would start at 11am and end at 3pm. Offices, businesses and schools were off to a slow start as residents of the overcrowded capital, with its collapsing amenities and worsening drainage situation, suffered the usual torments with the torrential rains. Major roads and junctions were feet deep in water and people of the old city and other vulnerable areas reported ground floors submerged and waist deep flooding in the streets outside. bdnews24.com correspondents reported sections of Mirpur Road, Bijoy Sharani, Shantinagar, Kaziparha, Shyaorhaparha, Dhanmondi and Lamatia under knee to waist deep water by midnight. The streets and alleys of Old Dhaka and parts of Basabo, Azimpur, Fakirapool, Moghbazar, Mowchak, Kakrail and Uttara were also severely flooded. Cars, three-wheelers and other motorised vehicles were seen abandoned in the flood waters throughout the city as their engines gave out. Jahangir Hossain, a CNG autorickshaw driver, told bdnews24.com that his engine stopped at least five times between Dhanmondi and Mirpur in the early hours. People caught waiting for late night transport were stuck on the emptying streets, forced to walk home soaking in the rain. Fights broke out among passengers to get aboard the few buses that were still plying through the small hours. Many reached their homes to find ground floors under water and homeowners were seen pumping or bailing water out of their houses through the night and into the morning. After weeks of dry weather during the peak monsoon months, bringing fears of drought for Aman farmers in the north, the central and southern regions saw some of the heaviest overnight rains of the year, the met office told bdnews24.com in the early hours of Tuesday. The weather office said the downpour was caused by a monsoon depression that had been developing over the northeast Bay and adjacent areas on Monday. Meteorlogists said the south-westerlies were also active in the Bay. Sanaul Haque, of the Dhaka meteorological office, told bdnews24.com at 3:30am that the depression was moving northward across the southwest coast and onto land, causing heavy rainfall over Khulna, Barisal Chittagong and Dhaka divisions. bdnews24.com/s
