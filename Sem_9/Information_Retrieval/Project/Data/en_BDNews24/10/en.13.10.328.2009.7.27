 Dhaka, July 27 (bdnews24.com)The government has appointed AK Abdul Momen, an economics teacher based in the US, as the next ambassador and permanent representative to the United Nations in New York. Prof Momen will replace Ismat Jahan who has recently been transferred to Brussels, said a statement issued by foreign ministry on Monday. Momen is currently chairperson of the department of Economics and Business at Framingham State College in Massachusetts, said the statement. He started his career as a public servant in Bangladesh in 1973-74, later switching to teaching. The recruitment ended the media's speculation on former army chief Gen Moeen U Ahmed's appointment as the permanent representative to the UN in New York. With Gen Moeen's retirement from the force in June, when his term as army chief came to an end, a section of the Bangladesh media had speculated on his possible appointment as Bangladesh envoy to the UN.
