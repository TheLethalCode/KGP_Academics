<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jul 27 (bdnews24.com)The government will consult the Supreme Court to determine whether the BDR mutineers should be tried under civil law or by military tribunal, law minister Shafique Ahmed said on Monday. The decision came from an inter-ministerial meeting on preparations for the trial. "We've decided to ask the chief justice for his opinion on how the trial can be held fairly, neutrally and be fast-tracked," Shafique told reporters. According to section 106 of the Constitution, the president can seek opinion from the Supreme Court on any issue, the minister said. The application to chief justice MM Ruhul Amin will be sent next week. bdnews
