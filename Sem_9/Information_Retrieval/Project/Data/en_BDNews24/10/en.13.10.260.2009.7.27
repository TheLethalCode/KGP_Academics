 Dhaka, July 27 (bdnews24.com)The blanket criticism of the 2007-2008 caretaker government will only stymie democratic progress, the ruling Awami League's general secretary said on Monday. "We should not forget that this caretaker government made a photo-based voters roll, held a fair election and put in place a neutral administration," Syed Ashraful Islam said at a discussion to mark 16th anniversary of Awami Swechchhashebok League, the party's volunteer organisation, at the Central Shaheed Minar premises. "Prime minister Sheikh Hasina said in parliament said all this. She said they did injustice to her and her Awami League. But we have to keep in mind how that situation [that led to the installation of that government] was created." He blamed BNP-Jamaat-led alliance for Jan 11, 2007 changeover that made way for an interim admiistration widely crtiticised for acting as a front for the military. "1/11 would not have happened if countrywide fake voters' list and conspiracy over Jan. 22 elections were not made, the Election Commission headed by [M A Aziz] and the caretaker government by [president Iajuddin Ahmed] were not made partisan." Swechchhasebok League president AFM Bahauddin Nasim presided over the discussion, attended, among others, by health minister AFM Ruhal Haq, jute minister Abdul Latif Siddiqui, education minister Nurul Islam Nahid and state minister for foreign affairs Dr. Hasan Mahmud. Mahmud slammed opposition chief Khaleda Zia for saying that vultures were flying in the sky when the country is on the road to progress. Yes, vultures are flying in the skyone is Tarique Rahman and the other being Arafat Rahman Coco." "They are abroad now and trying to come back home. And their mother sitting in the cantonment is conspiring against the government. It has to be resisted." Earlier Swechchsebok League leaders exchanged greetings with prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who cut a cake to mark the anniversary. The organisation hosted a cultural programme and brought out a colourful rally before and after the discussion. bdnew
