 Dhaka, July 28 (bdnews24.com)--Senior opposition leader Salauddin Quader Chowdhury says he will bring a sedition case against former president Iajuddin Ahmed, former caretaker government chief Fakhruddin Ahmed, chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda and eight others with sedition for the 1/11 takeover. At a press conference at his Dhanmondi home, the BNP MP also named former advisers Mainul Hosein and MA Matin, election commissioners Mohammed Sohul Hossain and M Sakhawat Hossain, former Anticorruption Commission chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury, lieutenant general Masud Uddin Chowdhury, former DGFI chief major general ATM Amin and former director of the Counter Intelligence Bureau brigadier general Chowdhury Fazlul Bari. 'I have started all preparations to file the sedition case against the 12 in three groups. This case will be filed with the High Court against them." Chowdhury told reporters. "We will seek the High Court's directives to ask the government to take steps to lodge a sedition case against the defendants." He said the first group included Iajuddin, Fakhruddin, ex-law adviser Moinul and former home adviser Matin. Generals Moeen, Masud, Amin and Bari were in the second group and the third included Elelction Commission's Huda, Sahul and Sakhawat, and Hasan Mashud. "Twelve people, including former president Iajuddin Ahmed and chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed, held power unonstitutionally." "It is a serious crime to take over power in this way in the eye of the constitution and law." Chowdhury pointed out that Justice ABM Khairul Haque had delivered a verdict on Dec 4, 2008 in a case related to the violation of the constitution by the then government and the Election Commission's failure to hold ninth parliamentary elections within 90 days. He said Justice Haque stated in the verdict that such a violation of the constitution was a serious crime. Former caretaker government adviser Sultana Kamal had filed the case against the government. "The twelve violated article 58 (c) of the constitution by assuming power for two years. They committed a serious crime by doing this," the BNP leader added. "The four army officers, including the former army chief, were engaged in sedition activities. The High Court will be appealed to give directives to court-martial them under Army Act." Moeen had admitted his use of state power in his book, Chowdhury added. Questioned if his party approved of his move to file the case, he said, "Yes, my party supports this all the way, I, Salauddin Quader Chowdhury, don't do anything without my party's support." Chowdhury, meanwhile, faces possible legal action by authorities to strip his membership of parliament. The Election Commission has said it is considering the legal implications before deciding whether to cancel Chowdhury's Chittagong-2 parliamentary seat for providing false information in his nomination papers prior to the December national polls. Chowdhury had told bdnews24.com by phone from Singapore on June 16 that he had not provided any false information regarding his educational credentials. bdnew
