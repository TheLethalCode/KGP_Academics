 Dhaka, 19 Sept (bdnews24.com)The prices of commodities have increased 18.88 percent on an average over the past eight months, according to a Consumers Association of Bangladesh study published Wednesday. The study was published at a discussion titled "Price hike of commodities and possible measures" at the Dhaka Reporters' Unity auditorium. Edible oil faced the highest hike, 67.93 percent, during the period. Prices of rice and flour increased 28.52 percent and 26.38 percent respectively. Economist Atiur Rahman chaired the discussion, where Dr M Asaduzzaman, research director of Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies, also spoke. Speakers criticised what they said was the caretaker government's failure to control price hike of daily essentials. Referring to India, Atiur Rahman said, "Our rate of inflation has crossed 10 percent, whereas India has kept it at 4 percent." Asaduzzaman disputed Bangladesh Bank's statement regarding imports saying, "Bangladesh Bank says that import of commodities has increased. But it is not providing us with figures for which we do not know the rate of increase." "We might have spent a higher amount of money on imports, but on importing what, who knows? Was it rice or anything else," he added. Asaduzzaman said that foodstuff stocks were not enough in the state- owned storehouses. Reazuddin Ahmed, editor of News Today, who attended the discussion, said: "The price hike cannot be controlled without bringing back confidence among businessmen." bdnews2
