 Dhaka, Sep 20 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court is set to rule Sunday on whether to accept appeals by convicts against the High Court verdict in the Bangabandhu Murder Case. The three-member Appellate Division bench of justices Tafazzal Islam, Joynal Abedin and M Hasan Amin Thursday ended hearing the "leave to appeal" petitions filed by the convicts through 25 workdays. In case the appeals are not accepted Sunday, the case for assassination of the country's independence leader Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman will be finally disposed of the same day. Chief justice Md Ruhul Amin formed a special bench of three senior judges on August 2 to hear the petitions for "leave to appeals" filed in the case. On Aug 5, the Supreme Court included the appeals for hearing on the work list and the hearing started on Aug 7. The High Court on Dec 14, 2000 delivered a split verdict in the case. Justice M Ruhul Amin upheld the death sentences handed down by the trial court to 10 of the accused. But the other judge, ABM Khairul Haque, retained the death sentences for 15 of the accused. On April 30, 2001, Justice M Fazlul Karim in the final High Court verdict in the case upheld death sentences for 12 and acquitted three. Dhaka district and sessions judge Golam Rasul on November 8, 1998, had awarded death sentences to 15 of the 20 accused. Muhitul Islam, Bangabandhu's personal assistant, filed a murder case with Dhanmandi Police Station on Oct 2, 1996, 21 years after Bangabandhu was murdered with most of his family members on August 15, 1975. As many as six High Court and Appellate Division judges felt embarrassed to hear the murder case. August 16, 2001 was set for hearing the leave to appeal petitions filed by four convicts against the High Court verdict. Hearing was deferred for eight consecutive dates, prompting the Apellate Division to drop the case from the work list. On March 19, 2002, when two Appellate Division judges felt embarrassed to hear the appeals, the case was not revived in the following five years. Incumbent chief justice Md Ruhul Amin and senior Appellate Division judge M Fazlul Karim could no more hear the case as they had sat on the High Court panel that handed down the judgment. The proceedings of the leave to appeal petitions could not take place for six years because of a shortage of judges. The immediate past BNP government took no step to resume the appeal hearings in the case. Justice Hasan Amin joined the Appellate Division in 2007, making the required minimum number of three judges to conduct the hearings. The repatriated convict AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed filed a belated leave to appeal petition on Sept 16, 2007. Barrister Abdullah Al Mamun represented convicts Bazlul Huda and AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed in the hearing. Senior advocate Khan Saifur Rahman represented Lt Col (retd) Syed Faruque Rahman and Mohiuddin Ahmed in court. Senior advocate Abdur Rezzaque Khan represented Lt Col (retd) Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan. The government side was represented by special counsel Annisul Haque, who was assisted by deputy attorney general Syed Haider Ali. Six death convicts are on the run. The US government arrested the seventh, AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed, on March 13, 2007 in Los Angeles and sent him back to Bangladesh on June 17. One of the death sentence awardee, Abdul Aziz Pasha, died a fugitive in Zimbabwe. bdnew
