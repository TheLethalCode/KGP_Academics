 Dhaka, Sept 21 (bdnews24.com)  Islamist outfit Hizb ut-Tahrir Friday accused the government of siding with anti-Islamists by beating up demonstrators who had taken to the street over a satirical cartoon strip that hurt religious feelings. Activists of Hizb ut-Tahrir and other organisations marched towards the office of the daily Prothom Alo in Karwan Bazar in the city earlier in the day to besiege the paper's office. The police charged baton to disperse them, leaving at least 25 hurt. The Prothom Alo in its satire magazine Aalpin carried the cartoon strip that was offensive to religious sensibilities. The organisation also alleged that a write-up published in the Eid issue of Bangla-language magazine Shaptahik 2000 defamed the Muslim's holy Kaba. It snubbed the apology offered by Prothom Alo editor Matiur Rahman to the Khatib of Baitul Mukarram mosque for publishing a controversial cartoon strip. Chief coordinator and spokesman for the organisation Mohiuddin Ahmed at a press conference Friday afternoon demanded closure of the weekly and arrest and trial of the editor. "Who is Khatib Ubaidul Huq to pardon the Prothom Alo? The Alem community of Bangladesh is not with him," Mohiuddin said, referring to the top cleric, who leads prayers at the national mosque. "He has done a somersault and indulged in shameless collaboration. Those who are with him are pro-[Jamaat-e-Islami]." Huq appeared on the state-run BTV Thursday to make public what transpired in a meeting with the embattled editor. "He swore upon Allah (performed taoba ) and apologised. When someone does that, what else can you do other than forgive him?" Mohiuddin demanded arrest of Prothom Alo and Shaptahik 2000 publisher Mahfuz Anam, Prothom Alo editor Matiur Rahman and Shaptahik 2000 editor Golam Mortaza within 72 hours. He also demanded immediate shutdown of Prothom Alo and Shaptahik 2000, and release of six members of Hizb ut-Tahrir arrested Friday across the country. Mohiuddin announced a protest programme after the tarabi prayers until Sunday, including processions, demonstrations and burning of copies of the two publications. He claimed more than 50 leaders and workers of the organisation, including its joint coordinator Morshedul Haq, were injured in a police beating on their processions towards the Prothom Alo office after Friday prayers. "The editor of Prothom Alo should be arrested immediately. This paper has been trying from the very beginning to prove Bangladesh as a failed and militant state," Haq said. bdnews24.c
