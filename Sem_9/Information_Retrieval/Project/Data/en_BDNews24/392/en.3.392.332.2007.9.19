<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 19 (bdnews24.com)  The country's top-selling Bangla-language newspaper Wednesday carried a second front-page apology in as many days for a rogue cartoon that had apparently hurt religious feelings of people. The Detective Branch of Police detained the cartoonist, Arifur Rahman, Tuesday in front of his Uttara home, Prothom Alo journalists and police said. Arif was handed over to Tejgaon Police Station after arrest, assistant sub-inspector Anwar Hossain told bdnews24.com. Arif did a cartoon story titled "Naam" on the sixth page of the 431st issue of its satire magazine Aalpin that hit the stands Monday. Prothom Alo, considered an influential newspaper by many, retracted the issue apparently under pressure from different quarters. The home ministry Tuesday ordered confiscation of all its copies, saying the cartoon story hurt the religious sentiment of the people. In a statement, the newspaper said the daily will no longer publish written pieces or cartoons by freelance cartoonist Arif and will be extremely cautious to prevent similar incidents in future. Some Islamic leaders led by Baitul Mukarram Khatib Maulana Obaidul Haque saw law and information adviser Mainul Hosein Tuesday and demanded arrest or surrender of the editor or others tied to the newspaper. After the meeting with the delegation, Mainul alleged: "There is a conspiracy to destablise the country. We are very concerned about the issue." The conspirators wanted to throw the country into a chaos, he alleged. Prothom Alo's joint editor Abdul Qaiyum told bdnews24.com by phone: "Our position is very clear. It happened because of a lack of caution. "The cartoonist is not on the staff of Prothom Alo. He is a freelancer," Qaiyum said, couching his words carefully apparently to disown the cartoonist. "We always review any contribution by freelancers. The cartoon was not selected for publication. Then again it got printed and it was a mistake." "We had a staff meeting and thought it over. The person in charge was sacked. We apologised. We hope everyone would forgive us." To put the house in order, Prothom Alo fired the person in charge. Daily Samokal editor Abed Khan said: "Firing somebody isn't the solution. The man who drew the cartoon wasn't responsible for publication. It's the people at the top who are responsible, really." "We shouldn't shift our responsibilities." "A newspaper is no place for fun. At the same time, we shouldn't be unforgiving." Shafik Rehman, editor of Jain Jai Din, told bdnews24.com: "No writers or cartoonists should hurt religious feelings. I think both know this principle." "Every piece of work carries a total identity. If there is inconsistency in it, that is a lack of cautiousness." "The matter should be forgiven with kindness. We have to avoid a repeat of what has already happened." The cartoonist, Arif, gained some popularity by drawing ant-corruption cartoons. He scored first in a cartoon competition organised by The Daily Star and finished third in a similar event by Transparency International, Bangladeshboth had corruption as the main theme. bdnews24
