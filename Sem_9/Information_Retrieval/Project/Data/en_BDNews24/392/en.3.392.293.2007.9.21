<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Sept 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Bush administration may increase the amount of money it is seeking for the Iraq war for the 2008 fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, the White House said on Friday. The White House outlined a request for around $147 billion for fiscal 2008 for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But the administration is reviewing those figures and is considering giving Congress an updated request. "I would expect it to be higher, I can't tell you what the number will be," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said. The Washington Post has reported the administration may increase its request by up to $50 billion, which would bring the total request to nearly $200 billion.
