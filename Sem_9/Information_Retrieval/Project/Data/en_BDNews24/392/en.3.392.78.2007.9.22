 Dhaka, Sept 22 (bdnews24.com)  The BGMEA has termed the Saturday-morning violence in Tejgaon Industrial Area as "a deep conspiracy to destroy the readymade garments industry". Garment worker discontent spilled out onto the streets following a factory 'lockout' ordered by owners who have experienced labour unrest recently due to wage demands. Leaders of Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association called for an exhaustive investigation into the unrest at a press conference following the incident. "Some unruly labour leaders incited the workers to stage this unwanted incident," said the BGMEA's acting president ABM Shamsuddin. Reading from a written statement Shamsuddin demanded the government take punitive steps against those responsible for the incident. He also called for action to be taken against any factory owner found to be involved in the incident. Speaking at the BGMEA office at Karwan Bazar, Shamsuddin said: "Nasa Group factories are among the few renowned exporters." "The owners of those factories have been paying salaries and other allowances to the workers according to the government's minimum wage structure." Shamsuddin added: "Despite this, employees from that factory stopped working on September 20 demanding an increase in their Eid bonus, attendance bonus, tiffin allowance and iftar allowance." "The staff failed to resume their work despite assurances from the owners." "Given the situation, a lockout was announced on Saturday morning in line with existing labour laws," he said. Workers attacked nearby factories and set several vehicles ablaze around the industrial estate. Nasa Group managing director Nazrul Islam Swapan said: "I have been involved with the garments business for 18 years." "I pay the workers their salary and bonuses regularly. Despite this I was compelled to lock out the factory," he said. Former BGMEA president Annisul Huq added: "The workers went on the rampage at the instigation of some individuals posing as labour leaders." "This is a conspiracy to destroy the garments industry in Bangladesh," he said. bdnews
