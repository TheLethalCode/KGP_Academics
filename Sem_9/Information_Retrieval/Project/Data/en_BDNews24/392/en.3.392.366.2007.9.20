<TITLE> European shares fall as bank fears resurface </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares fell on Thursday, dented by fresh concern about the impact of the credit crunch on banks' profitability following a warning from Deutsche Bank and another slide in Northern Rock shares. Deutsche was among the biggest negative weights on the index after Chief Executive Josef Ackermann said late on Wednesday the liquidity crisis would take its toll on third-quarter profits at Germany's biggest bank. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares ended unofficially down 0.6 percent at 1,539.89 points. But this followed Tuesday's 2.6 percent rally, the largest one-day gain for the index since early 2003. "We were always going to get to a point where we eased back a bit, so I think today's fall is negligible in the grand scheme of things," said David Jones, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets. Northern Rock tumbled to a record low as concern surfaced about the guarantees offered by the Bank of England on its deposits and on renewed concerns that a potential buyer may not materalise. Northern Rock shares were last down nearly 30 percent, having lost 76 percent since the start of this month, while Deutsche Bank fell by nearly 2 percent. London's FTSE 100 index lost 0.4 percent, while Frankfurt's DAX eased 0.2 percent and Paris' CAC 40 fell 0.7 percent.
