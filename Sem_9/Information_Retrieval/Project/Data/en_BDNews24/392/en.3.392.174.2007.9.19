 Dhaka, Sept 19 (bdnews24.com) -- The market monitoring committee of the commerce ministry wants lifting of tolls for vehicles carrying essential commodities over the Jamuna bridge as part of an effort to control market prices during Ramadan. Commerce ministry official Golam Mostakim briefed reporters in this regard after a meeting Wednesday. The meeting also discussed import of 30,000 tonnes of potato seeds for the flood-affected farmers. The Department of Agriculture Extension had already started importing necessary items. "While the prices of some commodities fell, that of a good number rose. The price hikes have happened due to unfavorable conditions on the international market as well as the domestic environment," Mostakim said. "The Trading Corporation of Bangladesh is currently selling sugar at Tk 27, pulses at Tk 60 and soybean oil Tk 74-76 per kilogram." "Following a reduction in imports from Myanmar and India, the cost of a kilogram of onions has increased 37.5 percent and now sells at about Tk 35-42 per kilogram in the market," he added. Mostakim suggested changing commonly eaten food items to ease the price pressure on them. "This is practised worldwide as a way to reduce pressure on daily essentials," he said. The commerce ministry official added: "The TCB is currently operating 15 mobile outlets in the country, including eight in Dhaka." "The Bangladesh Riffles is also operating 270 outlets, with 100 in Dhaka while the Fisheries Department is selling formalin-free fish through five outlets in the capital," he said. bdnews
