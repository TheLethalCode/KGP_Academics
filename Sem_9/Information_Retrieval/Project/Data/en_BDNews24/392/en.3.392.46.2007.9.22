 Dhaka, Sept 22 (bdnews24.com)  Former national hockey striker Shamim Reza apparently committed suicide in the city early Saturday. He was 23. Shamim was said to have been suffering from depression because of poverty. He took toilet cleaner Harpic at his Bohorampur home in Rajshahai and was taken to Rajshahi Medical College and Hospital at about 4:00pm. The doctor on duty there referred him to the Dhaka Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) at 6:30pm as the conditioned worsened. Shamim died at the hospital early Saturday. His death coincides with the death anniversary of hockey player Robiuddin, who died eight years ago. He left behind the mother, three brothers and two sisters. "He was deeply depressed for the last few days and felt guilty for not being of much financial help to his family. This might have caused him to commit suicide," Raisuddin Ahmed Babu, a Rajshahi hockey organiser, told bdnews24.com by phone. He had a fight with his family before he took Harpic, neighbours said, but it could not be independently confirmed. "Alongside financial crisis, he was unhappy with his left ankle injury that threatened his career and might have cost him his life," Ashraful Islam Shishu, a national striker and Shamim's neighbour, told bdnews24.com. The promising striker first wore Bangladesh in 1999 and was with the national side until 2006. He went to England in 2002 to make a fortune there but returned home after two years. The stocky striker played for Mohammedan Sporting Club last season and was the highest scorer in the domestic league in 2001. Shamim was laid to rest at the Mohishbathan graveyard in Rajshahi in the afternoon. bd
