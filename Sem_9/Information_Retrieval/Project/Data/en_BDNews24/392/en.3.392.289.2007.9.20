<TITLE> Bangladesh skies widen for foreign flights </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 19 (bdnews24.com) The government has decided to allow foreign airlines to operate under an 'open-skies policy' to reduce the current flight crisis. The designated foreign airlines will now be able to operate unlimited flights in and out of the country's three international airports for three months, starting in October. The decision came Wednesday at a meeting of the council of advisers who gave approval to the open-skies proposal by the Ministry of Civil Aviation. The meeting observed that the policy would help overcome the flight crisis for outgoing passengers, in particular Bangladeshi expatriates and overseas workers heading to Malaysia and the Middle East. Hajj flights however will be excluded from the scheme that will open up Zia International Airport in Dhaka, Shah Amanat International Airport in Chittagong and Osmani International Airport in Sylhet to more foreign flights. In the past Bangladesh has restricted the schedules of foreign carriers to protect its national airline Biman. Under the new system, the designated airlines will operate flights on the basis of 'available point of call', while Biman may operate the same number of flights as the foreign carriers. bdnews24.co
