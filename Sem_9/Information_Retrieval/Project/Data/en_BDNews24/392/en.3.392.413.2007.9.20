 TEHRAN Thu Sep 20,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran said on Thursday it had "scared its enemies" by test flying two new generation, domestically-produced jet fighter planes and had shown its battle readiness, the latest riposte to speculation about a war over Tehran's nuclear plans. French officials, including President Nicolas Sarkozy, have spurred talk about a possible war by saying the failure of diplomacy to resolve Iran's dispute with the West over its atomic programme could result in conflict.

Iran said in September last year it had for the first time flown one of the Saegheh planes, describing it then as a modification of a warplane already in its fleet. It did not say at the time on what plane the Saegheh was based, but images shown of its test flight suggested it might be based around a US-built F-5, a plane bought from the United States when Iran was a US ally before the 1979 revolution. State television said the Saegheh jet was a new generation of the Azarakhsh (Lightning) fighter, which Iran said in August was now being built on an industrial scale.
