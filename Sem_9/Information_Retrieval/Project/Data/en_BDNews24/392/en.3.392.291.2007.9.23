 MADRID, Sept 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona's Nou Camp stadium is to have a radical new $350 million face lift when it is remodelled by British architect Norman Foster, the Primera Liga club said on Saturday. The 50-year-old stadium will be enveloped in a mosaic veil of coloured tiles, a mixture of polycarbonate and coloured glass panels. Integrated within the tiles of the outer skin will be special lighting elements which will mean the external facade can be used for animated lighting displays. "Everybody will instantly see the stadium's new external appearance as a strong and bold manifestation of the club," Barca said in a statement. "It will be seen as fitting proudly into the City of Barcelona's architectural heritage of distinctive and colourful buildings. They will appreciate it as a thoroughly modern stadium built upon on a proud heritage." A roof will be constructed to cover the seating areas, and improved amenities include mechanical escalators to the upper levels. The construction plan is designed to avoid disruption to the club's programme of matches
