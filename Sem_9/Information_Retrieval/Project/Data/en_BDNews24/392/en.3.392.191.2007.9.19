<TITLE> Autocrats tried to muffle media, says Press Council chair </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 19 (bdnews24.com)  Press Council chairman Justice Abu Sayeed Ahmad Wednesday said every autocratic government had tried to silence the media. "The media enjoyed greater freedom in a democratic government," he said at a seminar organised to mark the third founding anniversary of Bangla-language daily Amar Desh at the National Press Club. But the chief of the media watchdog called for caution in handling sensitive issues and asked editors to "act responsibly". On a controversial cartoon published in a satire magazine of Prothom Alo, Sayeed said: "Prothom Alo didn't do the right thing by publishing it." He alleged that sometimes newspapers do not publish rejoinders to some news items. "Even if they do, they downplay the rejoinders putting them beyond easy attention. "Journalists are a respectable community. They should not be tried under the CrPC. Everything could be settled though the Press Council, but it requires amendments to the law." In his inaugural speech, Ataus Samad, advisory editor for Amar Desh, said: "Things have changed. Editors used to take a stand against some ads. But now the job of an editor is to get as many ads as possible." "To run a 16-page newspaper, the company needs Tk 2 crore a month, and at least Tk 1.5 crore comes from ads." Reazuddin Ahmed, editor of News Today, said: "Emergency powers rules hang upon us like a sword. The government has not used the rules against the media yet. But the information adviser reminded us of the scope for the use of the rules." Editor of the Bangla-language daily Nayadiganta Alamgir Mohiuddin said newspapers were hostage not only to the advertisers, but to the newspaper hawkers for sales as well. Professor Syed Anwar Hossain said the newspapers do not seem to operate in a democratic environment. "Journalists have to accept too many conditions for jobs in the newspapers." bdnews24.
