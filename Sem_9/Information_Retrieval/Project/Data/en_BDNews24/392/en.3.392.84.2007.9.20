<TITLE> Editors ask Islamic clerics for tolerance over 'rogue' cartoon </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com)  Editors of some leading dailies Thursday urged Islamic clerics be tolerant to a 'rogue' cartoon that hurt religious sensibilities. Top-selling Bangla-language newspaper daily Prothom Alo carried the cartoon strip titled 'Naam" in its satire magazine Aalpin Monday. In a joint statement, they said the publication of the cartoon was "unwanted and careless." The Independent editor Mahbubul Alam, Daily Jugantor editor Golam Sarwar, Sangbad editor Bazlur Rahman, Manabjamin editor Motiur Rahman Chowdhury, News Today editor Reazuddin Ahmed, Ittefaq editor Rahat Khan, Amar Desh editor Amanullah Kabir, The Bangladesh Observer editor Iqbal Sobhan Chowdhury, Dainik Dinkal editor Aminur Rahman Sarker and Naya Diganto editor Alamgir Mohiuddin met over the issue that has enraged Islamic clerics. However, Dainik Dinkal and the Naya Diganto editors did not sign the joint statement. The editors also separately met information adviser Mainul Hosein in his law ministry office. The editors said Prothom Alo authorities had offered apologies for the mistake. Cartoonist Arifur Rahman had been arrested and the issue of the Aalpin confiscated, they added. The daily Jugantor editor Golam Sarwar read out the statement to journalists after the meeting. "With different steps taken so far we think the devoted Muslims will feel assured. We are respectful of religious feelings. We urge the Alem community to look at the matter from a forgiving viewpoint," the statement said. "The publication of the cartoon in the Prothom Alo magazine was unfortunate; it hurt the religious sentiments of the devoted Muslims. The Prothom Alo editor has already apologised saying that the cartoon was mistakenly published." "We believe Prothom Alo respects the religious feelings. The authorities fired the Aalpin editor in charge and declared that they would not publish any cartoon by cartoonist Arifur Rahman in future." The editors urged all to be patient and resilient and advised Prothom Alo authorities to be careful to avoid a repeat of such mistakes in future. The information adviser, however, did not say anything to journalists on the matter. bdnews24
