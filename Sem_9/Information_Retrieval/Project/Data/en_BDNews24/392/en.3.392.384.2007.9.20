 Cape Town, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com)  Some reckless slogging when consolidation was needed made sure Bangladesh ended their Twenty20 World Cup campaign on a low after they lost to Pakistan by four wickets at Newlands, Cape Town Thursday. Pakistan raced to 141 for six in 19 overs to go the semifinals with an all-win record after Bangladesh made a mess of a solid start to get all out for 140 in 19.4 overs thanks to Man of the Match Junaed Siddique's 71 on debut. A lacklustre Pakistan had a few butterflies in their stomach before reaching home. It could still have been a different story had Mahmudullah Riyad not dropped Imran Nazir on four with Pakistan needing another runs 30 runs from 27 balls. Ashraful also could taken the the match to a tense finish if he could picked and threw at the stumps with Nazir struggling as Pakistan were 128 for six in 17.5 overs. Nazir, who had retired hurt taking a painful blow when he tried to pull Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, took the side home with an unbeaten 27 off 18 balls, hitting three fours and a six. Bangladesh bowlers pegged the Pakistanis back taking two big wickets in five balls to reduce them to 105 for five in 15.2 overs, but later could not keep the momentum. Shahid Afridi, promoted up the order, topscored with a 15-ball 39. Salman Butt was run out for 21 as he sauntered about outside the crease and wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim threw the stumps down. Mashrafee trapped dangerman Misbah-ul-Haq for one and Mahmudullah had Shoaib Malik slog one to caught by Aftab Ahmed at deep square leg for 21. Abdur Razzak had Younis Khan stumped by wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim off a wide ball for one after he had Shahid Afridi edge to Mushfiqur for 39 off 15 balls. In between, Mohammad Hafeez (23) lofted Syed Rasel straight to long-of where Tamim Iqbal took a simple catch near the boundary line. Earlier, Junaed scored more than half of Bangladesh's total off just 49 balls but other batsmen fell making rash strokes. The left-handed opener put on 63 runs for the second wicket with Aftab Ahmed (15) and another 23 for the fifth wicket with Nadif Chowdhury (12) before he heaved Shoaib Malik to Misbah-ul-Haq in the deep. He smashed three sixes and six fours to show his experienced colleagues that batting was not that tough as they made it look like. Hafeez with his off-spinners made the difference, first running opener Tamim Iqbal (3) out by a direct throw and then breaking the promising second wicket stand between Junaed and Aftab Ahmed. Aftab went for a heave off Hafeez only to be stumped by Kamran Akmal. The off-spinner then took a return-catch off Saqib Al Hasan (1) to reduce Bangladesh to 86 for 4 in 11.2 overs before Afridi got the prize wicket of Mohammad Ashraful (5), who tried to play around his front pad to be adjudged lbw. After Junaed got out to leave the side at 112 for five in 14.1 overs, Bangladesh could not accelerate the run rate and lost the last five wickets for just 28 runs. The Pakistan captain induced Nadif Chowdhury to edge to wicketkeeper Akmal for 12 before Umar Gul ran out double-minded Mahmudullah (1) with a direct throw. Mashrafee chipped in with 11 off 14 balls before being paceman Mohammad Asif's first victim, and Syed Rasel was bowled by Gul. Malik and Hafeez took two wickets each for 15 and 27 while Gul, Asif and Shaid Afridi grabbed one wicket each. bd
