<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 22 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League presidium member Tofail Ahmed Saturday said talks between the AL-led 14-party alliance members would take place ahead of any meeting with the Election Commission. The presidium member added that the critical discussions would be based on the alliances' 31-point reform proposal. Tofail told reporters at his Banani home: "The chief adviser, the chief election commissioner and the army chief are determined to hold the elections by 2008." "The aims of the 14-party alliance are one and the same and these will be the basis of our discussions with the EC." "That's why we have taken steps to hold inter-party talks with the alliance. "There is common ground between the EC's work and our proposal. So everybody should co-operate with the commission," he said. Tofail remained non-committal when quizzed over the current strength of the 14-party alliance. "Many changes took place after 1/11. Differences emerged among the views of the parties." "We will continue our talks. We must all take care to produce a successful EC roadmap," the AL leader said. "All members of the 14-party alliance agree that we should sit together as early as possible." bdnews
