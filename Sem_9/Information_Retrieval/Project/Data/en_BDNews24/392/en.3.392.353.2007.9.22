<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 22 (bdnews24.com)  Hundreds of garment workers took to streets at around 10:30 Saturday morning in Tejgaon Industrial Area in Dhaka for unpaid salary and wages. The furious workers vandalised a garment factory and fought pitched battles with the army, RAB and the police. Traffic in Tejgaon and Mohakhali areas screeched to a halt for sometime in the wake of the violence. All garment factories in the industrial area have been closed down following the chaos. A labour unrest had brewed in the past two days over pay, iftar and festival allowances ahead of Eid at several factories of Nasa Group in Tejgaon-Begunbari area. Police had already been deployed there. Security was reinforced in front of the factories in the area that remained tense, bdnews24.com senior correspondent Liton Haider and staff correspondent Golam Mortuza Antu reported from the scene. The owners' body BGMEA held a media briefing in the afternoon to explain the situation. The workers said they had found four garments factories of Nasa Group housed in the same building in Begunbari had been closed when they had come to work Saturday morning. They took to the streets to protest the closure without notice and were joined by hundreds of stick-wielding workers from 15 to 20 nearby garment factories. Soon the Tejgaon, Mohakhali and Gulshan Link Road areas erupted in violence as the workers fought pitched battles with the police who had tried to block them. Traffic snarled to a stop and shops nearby were closed. Agitating workers set fire to a Gulistan-bound No 6 bus at the Nabisco crossing and smashed at least five vehicles. They also threw stones at and vandalised a factory of Shefal Group when the workers of the factory refused to join them. Army and RAB were despatched to the aid of the police at about 11am and they tried to push back the agitators. At least 15 workers were injured when the security forces and the demonstrators chased each other. The police arrested three persons at the scene and brought the situation under control at about 12:30pm. A notice signed by Nasa Group managing director Nazrul Islam Swapan was hung on the main gate of the main building. It said the workers of Nasa Knitwear Ltd, Nasa Apparel Ltd, Starlight Knitwear Ltd and Western Dress Ltd stopped work since Thursday on different demands. The action was in clear violation of the section 13(1) of labour law, the owner said. The workers had turned down appeals to resume work, leaving authorities with no option but to close down indefinitely, the notice added. However, Mohammad Mehedi, a worker of Nasa Group, told bdnews24.com, "The workers of Tejgaon Padma Politon Cotton Garments get Tk 20 per day as allowance for iftar but we get only Tk 5. How do we buy iftar items with Tk 5?" Sabina Begum, another worker, said, "The owners of Nasa Group compel us to work until midnight, but don't pay us overtime. "And if we work through the night we get only Tk 35. Also, they don't pay when electricity goes off and work stops." Motahar Hossain, an operator of Nasa Group, said his monthly pay was only Tk 2,400 and last Eid he had had a lungi as bonus. BGMEA president Anwar-ul-Alam Chowdhury, now abroad, told bdnews24.com by telephone, "We are watching the Tejgaon situation. After an emergency meeting we will give our reaction in a press conference [Saturday] afternoon." BGMEA director Annisul Huq was quick to point fingers at "instigators". "We think some unruly workers are behind [the unrest]. They are acting at the instigation of some labour leaders and ransacked the factories which are in no way acceptable. "They factories which were vandalised pay salaries and allowances regularly." "This incident will have a negative impact on the export. The buyers will be upset with us," he said. bdnews24.com
