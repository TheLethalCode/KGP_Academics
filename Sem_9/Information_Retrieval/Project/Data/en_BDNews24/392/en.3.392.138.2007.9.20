 Dhaka, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Thursday refused to accept a bail appeal for former prime minister Khaleda Zia in GATCO corruption case taken under the cover of emergency powers rules. Dhaka metropolitan senior special judge M Azizul Haque asked her lawyers to submit the written statement to the High Court. Khaleda's lawyer advocate Sanaullah Miah submitted the petition at 9:15am. A case was filed against Khaleda on Sept 2 with Tejgaon Police Station, charging the BNP chief with abusing authority as prime minister in awarding business firm GATCO container-handling contracts at Chittagong port and Kamalapur Inland Container Depot. Khaleda and younger son Arafat Rahman Coco were arrested at their their home on Sept 3 and produced before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka. Both were sent to jail after the court rejected a bail appeal filed by her lawyers. On Sept 12, the lawyers moved the CMM's Court for her bail again. Magistrate Jalal Ahmed rejected the appeal on the grounds that his court was not legally authorised to hear it since the case had been brought under emergency powers rules. bdnews24
