<TEXT>
 LONDON, Sept 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The head of Britain's counter terrorism branch, who oversaw the police's response to the London bomb attacks in July 2005, is to step down next year, Scotland Yard said in a statement on Friday. Peter Clarke, the head of the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command, will retire in January 2008 to pursue a range of new "appointments and projects". The Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA) and the head of London's police force said they had reluctantly accepted his decision. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Clarke, who is also National Coordinator of Terrorist Investigations, has been with the Metropolitan Police for over 30 years. "Peter Clarke is a dedicated public servant, often working behind the scenes, who made an immense contribution to protecting the public and in doing so has undoubtedly saved lives," said MPA chairman Len Duvall. As well as the London suicide bombings which killed 52 people, Clarke has headed investigations into numerous other al Qaeda-inspired plots which police say could also have caused mass deaths. He led the probes that resulted in the convictions of Dhiren Barot, jailed for plotting to blow up US financial institutions and planning "dirty bomb" attacks in Britain, and a gang whose targets included trains and nightclubs. "Peter Clarke has performed outstandingly. His contribution to the fight against terrorism has been truly significant," said London's police commisioner Ian Blair. His post will be advertised in Police Review in the next couple of weeks.
