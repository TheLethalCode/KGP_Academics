 Dhaka, Sep 19 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Wednesday ruled the arrest and detention of former FBCCI president Abdul Awal Mintoo illegal and ordered the government to free him if no other case was pending against him. The HC bench of justices Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Zubayer Rahman Chowdhury issued what is called a final verdict, after hearing a writ petition submitted by Mintoo's son Tabid Awal. Tabid in the petition challenged the legitimacy of his father's arrest without an warrant or any case. The government detained Mintoo under the emergency powers rules on Aug 6. The HC however had stayed the detention order and granted him bail on Aug 7. The government appealed to the Appellate Division against the HC order, which wthe appeals court halted on Aug 27 and ordered settlement of the writ petition at the High Court. bdnews24.com
