<TITLE> Turk PM defends new charter, targets headscarf ban </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ANKARA, Sept 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan defended plans on Wednesday for a radical overhaul of Turkey's constitution, but his call for an easing of the ban on the Islamic headscarf rattled his powerful secular critics. Erdogan's ruling Islamist-rooted AK Party, which won a fresh five-year mandate in July elections, has said the new charter will favour the individual over the state and bring Turkey more into line with the European Union, which Ankara hopes to join. "It's time to have a modern constitution that represents our nation's common sense and wisdom ... that will realise the ideal of a free Turkey," Erdogan told a news conference. Erdogan rejected criticism that the AK Party wanted to impose its own text on Turkey and pledged full, open discussions in parliament, the media and elsewhere. But Erdogan's apparent desire to include in the constitution an easing of the ban on the headscarf in universities has alarmed Turkey's secular elite, which views the garment as a symbolic threat to the separation of religion and state. University rectors and the head of Turkey's Court of Appeals both warned on Wednesday against any change in this regulation. In Wednesday's Financial Times, Erdogan was quoted as saying: "The right to higher education cannot be restricted because of what a girl wears." "There is no such problem in Western societies but there is a problem in Turkey and I believe it is the first duty of those in politics to solve the problem," said Erdogan, whose wife and daughters both wear the headscarf. The new constitution would replace a document that dates back to a period of military rule in Turkey in the early 1980s. Turkey's army, which views itself as the ultimate guarantor of secularism, is closely following the constitutional debates, as are nervous financial markets. Ten years ago the military ousted a government it saw as too Islamist. In April, the army tried to stop the AK Party's Abdullah Gul becoming president in an election in parliament because of his Islamist roots and his wife's Muslim headscarf. Gul finally became president in August after the standoff with the army triggered early parliamentary elections which the AK Party won resoundingly. Nobody expects a military intervention at this stage, given the government's popularity. The army knows heavy-handed action would wreck Turkey's EU membership bid and its booming economy. But despite the government's big parliamentary majority and the fervent hopes of its piously conservative voters for change, Erdogan knows he must tread warily on the headscarf issue. "These discussions may lead to further polarisation in Turkey," said Ayse Ayata, a professor at Ankara's Middle East Technical University. "The lifting of the ban (on the headscarf) could lead to increased community pressure on uncovered women to cover up." Ayata said the draft text of the constitution also risked eroding Turkey's delicate system of checks and balances by giving parliament and the government too much power. Erdogan has said Turkish voters will have the last word on the new constitution in a referendum, probably next ye
