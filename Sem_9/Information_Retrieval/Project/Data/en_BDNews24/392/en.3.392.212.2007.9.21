 Dhaka, Sept (bdnews24.com)  The Securities and Exchange Commission is to investigate the unusual trading of the shares of Apex Adelchi Footwear Ltd, according to a notice of the stock market watchdog. "Price movement and trading of Apex Footwear shares appear unusual to us," SEC executive director Anwarul Kabir Bhuiyan told bdnews24.com Thursday. "We have formed an inquiry committee to examine whether there is any manipulation going on in the trading of its shares." The regulatory move came after shares of the footwear manufacturer rose consistently since July 2, hitting a record high of Tk 2366 on September 13, up from just Tk 586.50 on July 2. Its price dropped a little on profit-taking and close at Tk 2206 Thursday, according to the Dhaka Stock Exchange. On July 29, Apex Footwear announced its earnings per share had increased to Tk 107.31 in the six months to June 2007, from Tk 33.18 a year before. Except for a report on the earnings yet to be audited, the company has repeatedly declared it was holding no undisclosed price-sensitive information on the unusual price rise in the shares. Bhuiyan however said the SEC might check with brokerage houses, individual clients and the company for share trading information on the footwear company. A two-member team will conduct the enquiry and submit the report within 30 working days. "The commission has recently observed certain unusual trading of shares of Apex Adelchi Footwear. The commission is of the opinion that it is necessary in the public interest to cause an enquiry in this regard," the SEC notice said. Apex Adelchi Footwear, listed with the Dhaka Stock Exchange in 1993, has clocked a steady growth in its earnings since 2002. Sponsor shareholders hold 35 percent of the shares, while institutional shareholders and the public own 37 and 28 percent respectively. bdnews2
