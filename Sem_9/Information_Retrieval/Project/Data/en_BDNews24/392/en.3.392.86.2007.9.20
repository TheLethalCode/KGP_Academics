 KATHMANDU, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nepal's Maoists plan to call a special session of parliament before November elections to debate the abolition of the monarchy, a spokesman said on Wednesday, as the former rebels try to restore their political credentials. The Maoists quit the interim government on Tuesday saying a free and fair vote was impossible until the monarchy was abolished. They said they would disrupt the poll campaign with street protests, raising fears for a fragile peace process. "We will call a meeting of the parliament to discuss our demand (for a debate)," Maoist spokesman Krishna Bahadur Mahara said. The decision to quit the government was in part dictated by fear among the Maoist leadership that their support was eroding while in power and hope that delaying the poll could help them rebuild popularity among voters, analysts said. The Maoists are likely to lose any parliamentary vote on the monarchy, as other mainstream parties said they would wait until the Nov. 22 constituent assembly polls before abolishing it. But by calling the vote, Maoist leaders are showing they have not totally rejected mainstream politics. "They are trying to legitimise their political credentials by showing that they are still looking to parliament to resolve the political issues," said Kunda Dixit, editor of the Nepali Times weekly. Their to-ing and fro-ing between parliamentary politics and street protests highlights the growing pains of rebels who spent years in the jungles of Nepal but now face the possibility of losing an election as they enter the mainstream. Thousands of former Maoist fighters housed in U.N.-supervised camps are unhappy about the lack of basic facilities like healthcare, food, drinking water and electricity. On Tuesday, the ex-fighters briefly left their camps and protested against the government and in support of their party's withdrawal from the coalition. Under the peace deal signed last November, government and Maoists had agreed to let the elected assembly take a final decision on the monarchy in the majority-Hindu nation. But the Maoists have now vowed to disrupt the polls, which were one of their own key demands to end the civil war, and have planned nationwide protests and general strikes to stop it. One senior Maoist leader urged Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala to resign, saying the veteran politician had failed to keep his coalition together. "He has lost the moral authority to remain in power. So he should resign," Chandra Prakash Gajurel told Reuters. A group of European ambassadors said they were deeply concerned about the Maoist threat to disrupt the elections. "If the elections cannot be held on time with the full support of all parties this will be a betrayal of the people's aspirations," the group said in a statement issued through the British Embassy in Kathmandu on Thursday. Yubaraj Ghimire, editor of the Samay news magazine, said the Maoists quit the government in part from growing fear of losing the vote, especially in the southern plains of Terai. "There is fear among the Maoists that they have lost their support base in the Terai which has sizeable votes," he said. Dozens of people -- many of them Maoists -- have been killed this year amid political tension in the Terai bordering India, where ethnic Madhesis are demanding more government jobs and seats in parliament. The United Nations has urged the Maoists to honour their commitments and not let the former fighters leave their camps for political protests. The death toll from weekend violence in Terai rose to 19 as police reached remote villages and recovered decomposed bodies, an official said on Thursday. Dozens of vehicles were torched and hundreds of houses set on fire by angry mobs after unidentified gunmen shot dead Mohit Khan, a local Madhesi politician, on Sunday near the southwestern town of Chandrauta, close to the border with Ind
