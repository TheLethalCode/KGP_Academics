 TEHRAN, Wed Sep 19,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran said on Wednesday it would use `all our means' to defend itself if attacked by the West, three days after France's foreign minister publicly raised the possibility of war over Tehran's disputed nuclear activities. When asked whether Iran would block the Hormuz Strait, the world's most important water way for oil shipments, if attacked, government spokesman Gholamhossein Elham dismissed it as "far- fetched" that anybody would take "this foolish option".

Western nations fear Iran is seeking to build atomic bombs despite Tehran's denials. The United States insists it wants diplomacy to end the row but has not ruled out military action should such a route fail. French Prime Minister Francois Fillon said on Monday everything must be done to avoid war with Iran, a day after Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said Paris should prepare for that possibility though he did not think any war was imminent. Kouchner's comments prompted major powers including the United States to say they believed the nuclear standoff could be resolved diplomatically. French Defence Minister Herve Morin said on Wednesday France had no plan to attack Iran "No one can think for one instant that we are imagining and preparing plans against Iran," he told Canal Plus televisi
