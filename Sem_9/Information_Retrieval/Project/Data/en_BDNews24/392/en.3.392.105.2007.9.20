 DURBAN, South Africa, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - All-rounder Andrew Flintoff's lingering ankle injury has ruled him out of England's one-day series in Sri Lanka, the England Cricket Board (ECB) said on Thursday. "Andrew Flintoff will return home to the UK today to receive specialist assessment on his left ankle," an ECB statement said. "As a result he will not take part in England's forthcoming one-day series in Sri Lanka." Flintoff played in all five of England's Twenty20 World Cup matches, but by Wednesday's game against India the strain was obvious when he began limping towards the end of his four overs. Flintoff had surgery on his left ankle in July 2006, and the statement said he was suffering from a recurrence of a previous injury. "Following the recent NatWest series in England Andrew experienced a reaction in his left ankle but subsequent scans determined no new injury had been sustained," the statement said. "After consultations with specialists it was felt that the ICC World Twenty20 tournament would provide a safe platform to assess how Andrew's ankle would respond to bowling in match conditions, without the risk of further damage to the ankle." The ECB said Flintoff had experienced discomfort as the World Twenty20 tournament progressed, but was keen to carry on playing. "At no time was further damage to the ankle sustained, but unfortunately it was clear that his ability to increase the intensity of his rehab and participation could not be progressed." Flintoff had not been ruled out of England's test series in Sri Lanka in November, the ECB added
