 BUCHAREST, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gheorghe Hagi resigned as Steaua Bucharest coach on Thursday after his team lost their opening Champions League group match 2-1 away to Slavia Prague, the club's owner said. "Hagi told the club's board he had decided to quit without giving any reasons," Gigi Becali told reporters on Monday. Hagi's decision was not unexpected after Becali repeatedly interfered in team matters, including picking the lineup. Hagi, who took over in June, led Steaua undefeated through the Champions League preliminary rounds but they are struggling in seventh place in the domestic league after scoring just four goals in the six matches they have played so far. Last month, Becali threatened to sack the former Romania midfielder after complaining that he did not stick to the lineup the club owner selected for their first league match. Becali also asked Hagi to select two players he wanted in the team for Wednesday's Group H match in Prague, saying the coach would have to leave unless he listened to orders. Becali said there was no way Hagi could change his mind about quitting his job with Steaua. "It was Hagi's honourable decision," Becali said. "A resignation is a resignation. It is all over now." In 2001 Hagi quit as Romania coach after failing to reach the World Cup. He resigned as coach of Turkish club Bursaspor in 2003 after a disappointing start to the season. Hagi won the Turkish Cup with Galatasaray in 2005 and then joined Politehnica Timisoara before quitting in 2006. Becali will ask former Steaua coach Cosmin Olaroiu, currently with Saudi Arabian club Al Hilal, to replace Hagi. "Olaroiu promised he would be permanently available for me," Becali said. "Just to call him.
