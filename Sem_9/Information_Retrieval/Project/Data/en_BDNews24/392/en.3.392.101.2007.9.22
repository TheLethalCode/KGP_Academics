 Abu Noman Sajib bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Set 21 (bdnews24.com)  Relatively unknown Islamist outfit Hizb ut-Tahrir took centre stage as it spearheaded Friday's street protests braving emergency rules against the controversial cartoon strip run by the Prothom Alo's satire magazine. The government, on its part, is not taking any action, at least for now, against the political party. It has refused to accept the apology offered by Prothom Alo editor Matiur Rahman for carrying the cartoon that hurt religious sensibilities and announced plans for continued demonstrations. "Who is Khatib Ubaidul Huq to pardon the Prothom Alo? The Alem community of Bangladesh is not with him," chief coordinator of Hizbut Tahrir Bangladesh Mohiuddin Ahmed said, referring to the top cleric, who leads prayers at the national mosque. Huq appeared on the state-run BTV Thursday to make public what transpired in a meeting with the embattled editor. "He swore upon Allah (performed taoba) and apologised. When someone does that, what else can you do other than forgive him?" Huq said. "He has done a somersault and indulged in shameless collaboration. Those who are with him are pro-[Jamaat-e-Islami]," Mohiuddin declared. Senior police officers Friday told bdnews24.com that they did not receive instructions on ways to deal with the protests. Senior police officers Friday told bdnews24.com that they did not receive instructions on ways to deal with the protests. Activists of Hizb ut-Tahrir and other Islamist organisations marched towards the office of the daily Prothom Alo in Karwan Bazar to besiege the paper's office. The police charged baton to disperse them, leaving at least 25 hurt. They also burnt effigies of the editor and the paper's publisher Mahfuz Anam in the national mosque after Friday prayers, as the police looked on. No case has been filed. Hizb ut-Tahrir, Arabic for party of liberation, which says it does not recognise the constitution of Bangladesh, at a press conference Friday accused the government of siding with anti-Islamists by beating up the demonstrators. It demanded arrest of Prothom Alo editor Matiur Rahman and Bangla-language magazine Shaptahik 2000 acting editor Golam Mortaza and their publisher Mahfuz Anam within 72 hours. Three Tahrir workers were detained in Sylhet city when they were circulating leaflets urging protest processions towards the Prothom Alo office in the northeastern city, the police said. The emergency-government has allowed limited indoor politics but an embargo on street agitations is still in force. The party has announced a series of protest programmes over the next few days across the country. Home secretary Abdul Karim Friday told bdnews24.com: "This is a matter for the law-enforcing agencies to look at. If anybody violates the state of emergency no order is required for taking action. "As per the Emergency Powers Rules the law-enforcing agencies will take necessary steps." Inspector general of police Noor Mohammad told bdnews24.com, "We are observing the matter. It will not be proper to make any comment right now." He, however, advised this correspondent to contact the Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) commissioner about the processions and rallies staged in the capital in breach of the state of emergency. Joint commissioner of DMP and chief of the detective branch Abdul Jalil, told bdnews24.com, "We have not yet got any orders in this regard." "We have not yet got any directive from higher authorities for filing case against Hizb ut-Tahrir members who took out processions and held rallies violating the state of emergency. Necessary steps will be taken if we get directives," officer-in-charge (OC) of Paltan Police Station Fariduddin said. "The police have filed a general diary over the incident of clashes in Shahbagh area. We have not been directed by the higher authorities to file case," Shahbagh police chief Shahidul Islam said. Leaders of Hizb ut-Tahrir however refuse to admit the protests were a violation of the emergency rules. Chief coordinator of Hizb ut-Tahrir Bangladesh Mohiuddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com, "We do not think this is a violation of the state of emergency. It is not any political activity. It is a matter of religious feeling. "We are not conducting any anti-government activity. So it does not fall under the emergency powers rules. "The emergency rules are applicable to the BNP and Awami League who misgoverned the country in the last 15 years." Floated in 1953, it has estimated one million following worldwide and been outlawed in many western countries. Mohiuddin said Hizb ut-Tahrir Bangladesh has no link with the main international organisation. "We make decisions independently. No assistance is taken from any foreign organisation. However, we follow same ideals." "We do not believe in the present constitution of the country. We want to establish a Khelafat state in the country by changing the present system of governance through a mass upsurge by continuing mass movement to unite the people," the chief coordinator said. "We do not support armed or coercive activities. We think such activities are against the Quran and Sunnah." Asked about the registration of the organisation, Mohiuddin said, "You see, the registration programme has just started. It was not compulsory earlier." "We started our activities in Bangladesh in 2001. We are conducting overt political activities. We are not conducting any sort of militancy." Continued Mohiuddin: "We do not support the present election system. This system only changes leadership. But the system of governance or ideology does not change. So we will have to change the government through mass upsurge by mobilising the people." On funding, he said, "We run the organisation on our own funds. We get money from the leaders, workers and well wishers. Besides, supporters of the organisation who have good jobs also contribute to the organisation." On the number of workers, the chief coordinator said, "In Bangladesh we have about 1,000 workers and more than 10,000 supporters. Besides, there are some supporters who do not come out on the streets." Mohiuddin said they would declare wider programmes if their demands were not met. Earlier on March 31, the police arrested 22 members of Hizb ut-Tahrir from Mohammadpur area on charges of violating the state of emergency. A court gave them 30 days' detention and sent to jail. Huge amounts of posters, leaflets, CDs and a computer were recovered. Mohammadpur police had said the arrestees had been watching a CD on the war in Afghanistan at the time of arrest. bdnews24.c
