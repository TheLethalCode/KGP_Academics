 Chittagong, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com)  Two cases were filed in Chittagong and Comilla against the editor, publisher and freelance cartoonist of Bangla-language daily Prothom Alo Thursday for hurting religious feelings and defamation. bdnews24.com's Chittagong correspondent reports: A madrasa administrator filed a defamation case with a Chittagong court. Patiya Al Jameya Al Islam Madrasa administrative officer Mohammad Reza filed the case that also cited "elements of sedition" in the publication of a controversial cartoon strip. Chittagong metropolitan magistrate Aminul Ahsan accepted the case and fixed Sept 30 for the next hearing. "The accused hurt the religious feelings of teachers, students, officials and employees of the plaintiff's institution as well as that of devoted Muslims in Bangladesh and all over the world by publishing a satirical cartoon," the plaintiff said. Reza alleged that it has "instigated a sense of disloyalty and enmity to the government". The FIR said: "The accused made an ill-attempt to destroy discipline in the country and jeopardise development efforts of the government." "The accused conspired to destroy Bangladesh's friendly relations with the Muslim world by tarnishing the image of the country abroad which is a clear offence like sedition," Reza alleged. The plaintiff appealed for an arrest warrant against Prothom Alo editor Matiur Rahman, its publisher Mahfuz Anam and contributing cartoonist Arifur Rahman and "stern punishment" to them. He urged the court to take the allegations into cognisance. Lawyers Abul Khair and Nasiruddin conducted the case on behalf of the plaintiff. bdnews24.com's Comilla correspondent adds: A Comilla District Bar Association member, advocate SM Ali Azad, filed a second case against Matiur Rahman, Mahfuz Anam and Arifur Rahman on charges of "hurting religious feelings and defamation". The case was filed with a Comilla court under the emergency powers rules. Magistrate Shahina Akhter of the cognisance court-1 accepted the case and ordered Kotwali police chief to take legal action. bdnews24.
