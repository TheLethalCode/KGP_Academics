 WASHINGTON, Sept 20 (Reuters) - US presidential candidates are stepping up their efforts to raise campaign dollars from Americans living abroad and going to such lengths as attending or sending surrogates to fund-raisers overseas. A report by the Center for Responsive Politics released on Thursday found that at least $471,500 has been donated to candidates by individuals living outside the United States in the first half of 2007, on track to surpass the $900,000 raised from overseas during the 2004 race. Presidential contenders have been mostly concentrating on the United States to raise millions of dollars to fund their campaigns, pay for staff and buy expensive advertising to attract voters ahead of the November 2008 election. But Americans living overseas represent a new pool of donors candidates are looking to tap. Only US citizens and immigrants with green cards may legally donate to federal campaigns. Republican front-runner and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani just returned from London where he held a fund-raiser and Democratic Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois is sending his wife Michelle there next month to seek campaign dollars. "Michelle is heading to London in mid-October for a day of closed press fund-raisers at the enthusiastic request of Americans living abroad," said Obama spokeswoman Jen Psaki. Obama so far has led the pack with donations from overseas, hauling in almost $200,000, followed by Giuliani who has raised about $120,000, according to the center. London topped the list of cities from where Americans donated, followed by Geneva. Democratic Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York, who leads the race for her party's nomination, is sending her own starpower to London to raise money on Oct. 3 for her bid, her husband former President Bill Clinton. "We're reaching out to all voters who are ready for change," said her spokesman Blake Zeff. The Center for Responsive Politics said donations mostly came from members of the military and the diplomatic corps but private citizens also wrote checks. Clinton has led the Democratic field in fund-raising by bringing in more than $63 million so far this year, trailed by Obama who has received almost $59 million in donations. Republican White House hopeful and former Massachusetts Gov. and Mitt Romney has led his party's money race bringing in $44 million followed by Giuliani who has raised $35.6 million.
