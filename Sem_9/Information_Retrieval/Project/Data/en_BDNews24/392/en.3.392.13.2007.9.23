<TEXT>
 MADRID, Sept 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ronaldinho has pulled out of Barcelona's squad to face Sevilla in the Nou Camp on Saturday with a muscle injury, the Primera Liga club said. "The player finished training on Friday with a calf muscle strain in his right leg and it has continued to be a problem today," said the Barca Web site (www.fcbarcelona.com). "The Brazilian is out of the Sevilla game and in the next few days we will see how he recovers to see if he will be available for the coming matches." Ronaldinho has been under pressure in recent days after a series of below par performances. Coach Frank Rijkaard has substituted him in the second half of the last three Barcelona matches, prompting doubts over the player's fitness. Spanish media have said the club are unhappy with reports about his private life and in particular a late night before last weekend's Osasuna match. On Friday, Rijkaard recognised the player was not in the best of form but said he expected a positive reaction to the criticism. "I am convinced he can return to being the player he was before. We are talking about a phenomenal player," the Dutchman told a news conference. "I have spoken with him and he has denied everything (about the media reports). I believe him, but it is clear we cannot accept that type of behaviour." Barcelona are at home to Real Zaragoza on Wednesday, and visit Levante next weekend
