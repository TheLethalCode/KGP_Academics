 LONDON, Sept 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British authorities said on Friday they had confirmed another case of foot and mouth on a farm in southern England and ordered the slaughter of its cattle. The farm is within a three-km (two-mile) protection zone previously set up around a farm infected with foot and mouth in the Surrey area. Tight restrictions on the movement and sale of animals are in force within the protection zone. "Positive test results for foot and mouth disease have now been confirmed at the site where it was decided that cattle should be slaughtered on suspicion earlier this evening," the ministry of agriculture said. "The affected animals are within the existing protection zone and this now becomes the sixth infected premises since August 3 this year," it added. Foot and mouth is a highly contagious disease that spreads easily on the wind. It can cause animals to foam at the mouth and collapse. Britain suffered a crippling outbreak of foot and mouth disease in 2001 when more than 6 million animals had to be culled. The outbreak hit agriculture and tourism hard, costing the economy an estimated 8.5 billion pounds ($17.14 billion).
