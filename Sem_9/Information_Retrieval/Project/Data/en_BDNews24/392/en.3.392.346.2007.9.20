<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com)- Islamic clerics have announced that they will not go for any Friday protest programme against Prothom Alo as its editor Matiur Rahman expressed apologies for an editorial mistake that "hurt religious sensibilities". The declaration is thought to be easing tensions created over the last two days over the publication of a controversial cartoon strip in the daily's satire magazine Aalpin. The Khatib of Baitul Mukarram National Mosque, Maulana Ubaidul Haque, told bdnews24.com: "Mr Matiur Rahman has expressed sorrows and asked for forgiveness." "In this context, if anybody makes mistakes and seeks forgiveness, he has to be forgiven. This is the principle in Islam. So we are not going for any programme on Friday." The Khatib said: "We have asked the Prothom Alo editor not to repeat such mistakes in future. We told him to ensure that nothing provocative or defamatory regarding Islam and the Rasul (pbuh) is printed in his paper. The editor has made a pledge to us." Islami Oikya Jote chairman Mufti Fazlul Haque Amini told bdnews24.com: "We are not calling any programme for Friday. However, we demand cancellation of the Prothom Alo publication and arrest of its editor and publisher." "We have not retreated from this demand. I was invited to the iftar party (with them), but I did not go." The Islamic Foundation has arranged the iftar party apparently to bring the clerics and editors together to resolve the problem. Law adviser Mainul Hosein, religious affairs adviser ASM Matiur Rahman, Prothom Alo editor Matiur Rahman, Dainik Jugantor editor Golam Sarwar, Dainik Samokal editor Abed Khan, Dainik Manabjamin editor Motiur Rahman Chowdhury were present at the iftar party. A government handout Thursday said the government had empowered the Dhaka Metropolitan Police to file a regular case against cartoonist Arifur Rahman responsible for the publication of the controversial cartoon. Police arrested Arif at his Uttara home on Sept 18. Arif is now in jail. bdnew
