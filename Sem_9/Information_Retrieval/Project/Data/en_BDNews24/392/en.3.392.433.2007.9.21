 Dhaka, Sept 21 (bdnews24.com)  Communist Party of Bangladesh (CPB) Friday said street demonstrations demanding closure of the Prothom Alo despite the daily offering apologies were politically motivated. CPB president Manzurul Ahsan Khan and general secretary Mujahidul Islam Selim in joint statement said Prothom Alo authorities had admitted their mistake and offered unconditional apologies. The authorities had also acknowledged that the cartoon strip published in the paper's satire magazine Aalpin had hurt the religious sensibilities. But some quarters had been fuelling tension and some people had taken out processions on the roads violating the state of emergency. The statement said the processions under police guard raised questions in the public mind. Bangladesher Samajtantrik Dal (BSD) expressed deep concern at the government apathy to the identified fundamentalist, communal quarters that had been creating tension over the cartoon strip. Shikkha Andolon Mancha also expressed concern at the attempt by a quarter to create tension even though the daily had apologised. bdnew
