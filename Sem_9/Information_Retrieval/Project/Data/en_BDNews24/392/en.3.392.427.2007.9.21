<TITLE> Bhuiyan's Singapore trip fishy: Hannan Shah </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 21 (bdnews24.com)  ASM Hannan Shah, advisor to the BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, Friday termed breakaway BNP faction leader Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan's Singapore trip "suspicious". "Mannan Bhuiyan's visit to Singapore on the pretext of medical treatment is suspicious. He had to check out of the posh hotel he checked in under pressure from party followers," Hannan Shah told reporters at his Mohakhali DOHS home. The retired brigadier general said once the ban on indoor politics was totally lifted many political leaders thriving on conspiracies will seek refuge underground. Hannan Shah said BNP would start discussion in the party once the Election Commission invited them to the electoral reforms dialogue. "After we receive the letter [from the Election Commission], we will sit with the secretary general and other leaders and make a decision," Hannan told bdnews24.com. He dismissed expelled joint secretary general Ashraf Hossain's claim that dhaner sheesh (sheaf of paddy) was the symbol of breakaway BNP. "Ashraf Hossain has been expelled from the party and so he cannot claim to be a member of BNP any more. The official emblem of the party is sheaf of paddy. No other party or individual can claim it as theirs." "Those expelled from the party are spreading chaos, but they should know that it is not wise. BNP leaders and workers will not support them. "True followers of BNP will be identified by all when the ban on indoor politics goes completely. The grassroots workers and leaders will then endorse that the leadership of BNP is in Khaleda Zia's hands." Continued Hannan Shah: "Many leaders who attended Mannan Bhuiyan's so-called meeting in Singapore have contacted us and said they had been pressured to attend it. A party cannot be formed merely on issuing threats and instilling fear." "For the release of our party chairperson Khaleda Zia, our workers abroad have staged protests and submitted petitions. Lawyers are preparing to file a writ petition in the High Court next week for her bail. We are hopeful that the High Court will deliver a fair ruling." bdnews24
