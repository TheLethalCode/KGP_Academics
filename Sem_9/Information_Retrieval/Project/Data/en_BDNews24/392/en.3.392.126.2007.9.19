 ISLAMABAD, Sept 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Commonwealth Secretary-General Don McKinnon reiterated on Wednesday the grouping's position that Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf should stand down as army chief by the end of the year. McKinnon arrived in Pakistan on Wednesday for talks with Musharraf and other government leaders to assess political developments in the run-up to presidential and parliamentary elections. Pakistani opposition parties have demanded that US ally Musharraf give up his post of army chief. Some also want to see him prevented from seeking another term in a presidential poll due by Oct. 15. General elections are due by mid-January. Musharraf's top legal aide told the Supreme Court on Tuesday the president would give up his position of army chief if he was re-elected president for another term by an electoral college of members of the national and provincial assemblies. The Commonwealth suspended Pakistan's membership after General Musharraf mounted a bloodless coup in 1999 but readmitted it in 2004, citing progress in democratic reforms. But a Commonwealth heads of government meeting in 2005 warned Musharraf that holding the posts of president and army chief was "incompatible with the basic principles of democracy". The leaders of 53 mostly ex-British Empire nations also said until the two offices were separated, Pakistan's process of democratisation would not be irreversible. They urged Pakistan to resolve the issue by the end of 2007, when Musharraf is constitutionally bound to step down as army chief. As well as Musharraf, McKinnon met Foreign Minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri and Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz. "The secretary-general reiterated the Commonwealth's position with respect to the president's retention of two offices," the group's secretariat said in a statement. It did not elaborate. Pakistan's state news agency said McKinnon was "greatly reassured" by Musharraf's statement on Tuesday about his decision to relinquish the post of army chief if re-elected. Musharraf stressed his "firm resolve to hold free, fair and transparent elections", the APP news agency said. Musharraf was treated as a pariah by the West after his coup, but criticism of his rule became muted after he took on a front-line role in the US-led war on terrorism, launched after the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States in 2001. The Commonwealth represents 1.8 billion people and a fifth of global trade but it has no formal decision-making powe
