<TITLE> SC sets deadline for Bangabandhu appeals </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 23 (bdnews24.com) The Supreme Court braces for a further drawn-out hearing on a series of appeals against death sentences in the Bangabandhu Murder Case as it has asked lawyers for five convicts to file regular appeals by Oct 30. In a ruling Sunday, the SC said the stay order on the execution of the death sentences would continue. The regular appeals that come after approval for "petitions for leave to appeal" are meant to move against the High Court's 2001 verdict. Failure to keep the regular appeals ready for hearing by Oct 30 will automatically "vacate" all the initial appeals, the court said. Twelve of the convicts had their death sentences upheld by the High Court's final verdict in the landmark case on April 30, 2001. Four of them who are currently in prison filed appeals with the Appellate Division the same year. They are former army officers: Bazlul Huda, Syed Faruque Rahman, Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Mohiuddin Ahmed. Another former army officer, AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed, filed an appeal through jail authorities on June 24, 2007 following his extradition from the US. Independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was assassinated along with most of his family on August 15, 1975. A case was filed on October 2, 199621 years after the killing. bd
