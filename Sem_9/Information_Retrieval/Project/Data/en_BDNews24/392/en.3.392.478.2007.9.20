<TITLE> Air Berlin to buy Condor from Thomas Cook </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 FRANKFURT/LONDON, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - German airline Air Berlin announced plans on Thursday to buy charter carrier Condor in a two-stage deal that could land Thomas Cook a near 30 percent stake in Air Berlin. The deal would see Air Berlin expand its fleet to around 160 planes, become Germany's second and Europe's fifth-biggest airline and give it a similar scale to low-cost rivals Ryanair and easyJet. Thomas Cook, Europe's second-largest travel firm, will sell Condor to Air Berlin in two stages: 75.1 percent in February 2009, and the remainder in February 2010 after Thomas Cook has exercised an option to buy Lufthansa's stake in Condor. It is also subject to Lufthansa not exercising a pre-emption right to buy the Condor shares that Air Berlin is buying. In return Thomas Cook will take up to a 29.9 percent stake in Air Berlin worth between 380 million and 475 million euros, gain three seats on the airline's board and receive around 120 million euros in cash. Thomas Cook joint chief executive, Manny Fontenla-Novoa, told reporters that the structure of the deal meant he did not expect it to trigger Lufthansa's right to buy the Condor shares, but a Lufthansa spokeswoman said she expected it would. Thomas Cook's majority owner Arcandor demanded that Lufthansa decide within a week whether it would excercise its option but Lufthansa said it would not be rushed, adding it had until 2009 to decide. Air Berlin shares were 6 percent higher in early trading, while Thomas Cook shares were up 3.3 percent in London as analysts gave their nod of approval. "We estimate that the deal will be around 6 percent earnings enhancing for Thomas Cook in 2009," said Investec analyst Joe Thomas. "Effectively, Thomas Cook will swap its existing 75 percent stake in Condor for 30 percent of the enlarged Air Berlin," he added The deal with also reduce Thomas Cook's debt by 185 million euros and plug 266 million euros of its pension deficit. The firms said they would save around 70 million euros a year by putting the two airlines together, adding they expected very few job losses. It would be Air Berlin's third acquisition within a year, having already bought domestic rivals DBA and LTU. Keeping Thomas Cook's stake just below 30 percent would allow it to avoid making a mandatory takeover offer for Air Berlin. The UK-based firm said it expected the deal to be earnings enhancing in two years time.
