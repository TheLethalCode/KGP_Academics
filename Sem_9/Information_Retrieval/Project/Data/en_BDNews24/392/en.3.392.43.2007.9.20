<TITLE> Brown to boycott summit if Mugabe attends </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said he would not attend a European Union-Africa summit in Lisbon in December if Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe was present. "I believe that, if he attended, President Mugabe would undermine the summit, diverting attention from the important issues that need to be resolved. In those circumstances, my attendance would not be appropriate," Brown wrote in an article in the Independent newspaper's Thursday edition. Critics say Mugabe has presided over the collapse of Zimbabwe's economy, now marked by the world's highest inflation rate of about 6,600 percent and joblessness of about 80 percent. Mugabe blames Western powers for the economic crisis and accuses them of plotting with the opposition to oust him. He is subject to a European Union travel ban but that could be suspended to allow him to attend the December meeting, which would be the first EU-Africa summit for seven years. Many African leaders want him there to help tackle the continent's problems and Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates, who holds the six-month EU presidency, wants to launch a dialogue with Africa at the summit. Brown accused Mugabe of "the abuse of his own people". "There is widespread torture and mass intimidation of the political opposition," he wrote. Brown, who has made Africa a priority since he took over the premiership from Tony Blair in late June, also urged tougher action against a government he said had left Zimbabweans in an "appalling and tragic situation". "Britain will not shirk our responsibilities to the people of Zimbabwe," he wrote, as he urged other world leaders to step up pressure on Mugabe. "We will ensure that the EU maintains sanctions against the 131 individuals in the ruling elite, including President Mugabe, who have committed human rights abuses - and extend sanctions to other individuals where necessary," he wrote. "We will press the UN Security Council to review more regularly the situation on the ground, and to despatch a humanitarian mission to Zimbabwe," he added. He also said Britain was preparing a financial aid package, along with African and international partners, for the end of the Mugabe regime. "This will include measures to help Zimbabwe restart and stabilise its economy, restructure and reduce its debt, help skilled people who have left the country return home, renovate schools and hospitals, and very importantly support fair land reform," he wrote
