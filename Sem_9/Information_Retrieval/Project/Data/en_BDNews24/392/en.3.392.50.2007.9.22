<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 22 (bdnews24.com)  Doubt lingers over a government move to form the first-ever national constitutional council, the law adviser said Saturday. "There is doubt about whether the incumbent government will be able to implement the initiative since forming such council is a long process," adviser Mainul Hosein told bdnews24.com by phone. "However, we have decided to implement it since it is a good idea. If we cannot implement it, we will leave it for the next government." Mainul also said the proposed council aims to ensure transparency in appointment competent people to constitutional posts, keeping the process free from partisan influence. He said the council would ensure transparent appointments to important bodies such as Bangladesh Public Service Commission, Election Commission, Anticorruption Commission, Supreme Court and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. The interim cabinet Wednesday discussed the issue of formulating the National Constitutional Council Ordinance 2007. It sent the proposal to the law ministry for a review and prepare a draft ordinance. An official who had attended the meeting said, requesting anonymity, the cabinet weighed an eight-member council headed by the chief justice as chairman. Persons not controversial would sit on the council to be formed by the president and they would review the composition of the constitutional bodies and make recommendations to the government. A law ministry official said the ministry has started work on the matter. Nepal and Sri Lanka have such councils and the draft on the council would draw on the models in the two countries. bdnews24.c
