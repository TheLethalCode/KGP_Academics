 Cape Town, Sept 19 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh look to cap their Twenty20 World Cup campaign on a high note when they take on Pakistan in their last Super Eights match at Newlands, Cape Town Thursday. "We must go for win against Pakistan," said Bangladesh skipper Mohammad Ashraful after losing to Sri Lanka Tuesday. Bangladesh froze on a sluggish pitch undone by rash hitting to go down by 64 runs after throttling Sri Lanka to a modest 147 for five to see their hopes of progressing to the semifinals fizzle out. The Bangladesh skipper admitted that they could not recover having been reduced to 31 for four inside seven overs. The top-order need to play patiently against Pakistan, who have nothing to gain from the game after ensuring their semifinals berth with a match in hand. But the Pakistanis will not take Bangladesh lightly and hope to go into the semifinals wining all their Super Eights matches. They stormed into the last four thrashing one-day world champions Australia and runners-up Sri Lanka. On Tuesday, Bangladesh bowled with excellent control against Sri Lanka to drive home the notion that the condition in Cape Town was ideal for the bowlers, who didn't give the batsmen much room to work with. The bowlers should exploit the Cape Town conditions once again to give the Tigers a real chance in the game. Bangladesh will also look to put behind the mistakes they had made in the Sri Lanka gamesloppy batting, patchy fielding and dropped catches. The team management has decided to blood in Junaed Siddique in place of opener Nazimuddin, who along with partner Tamim Iqbal has miserably failed to get the Tigers off to a good start in the tournament. Left-handed Junaed is the country's lone T20 centurion in domestic cricket. Nazimuddin has scored only 12 runs in four matches 11 against Australia, 1 against the West Indies and 0 against Sri Lanka and South Africa. His senior partner Tamim Iqbal has an unimpressive 53 runs 32 against Australia, 10 against the West Indies, 8 against South Africa and 3 against Sri Lanka, but he will get a game Thursday. "Our opening has been a problem. Tamim (Iqbal) and Nazim have not performed up to expectations and the top-order has not batted consistently well. "But we have played some good cricket overall and we hope to end with a performance worthy of our capability," Ashraful was quoted by tigerCricket.com as saying. Bangladesh squad: Tamim Iqbal, Junaed Siddique, Aftab Ahmed, Mohammad Ashraful, Saqib Al Hasan, Abdur Razzak, Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, Syed Rasel, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mahmudullah and Nadif Chowdhury. bd
