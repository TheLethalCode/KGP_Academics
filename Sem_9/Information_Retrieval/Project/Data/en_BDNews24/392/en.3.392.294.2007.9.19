<TEXT>
 DURBAN, South Africa, Sept 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Justin Kemp's aggressive batting spurred South Africa to a six-wicket win over New Zealand in a Twenty20 World Cup Super Eights match on Wednesday. Kemp smashed six fours and six sixes in his 56-ball 89 not out, the top score in South Africa's reply of 158 for four to New Zealand's total of 153 for eight. South Africa, who beat England in their first Super Eights match on Sunday, now have four points from two games in the group and face India in their last game. New Zealand, who have beaten both India and England, have four points from three games, with semi-final places going to the top two in each of the two Super Eights groups. Fast bowler Morne Morkel took four for 17 to lead a South African fightback after Lou Vincent (32) and Brendon McCullum (38) had put on 68 for New Zealand's first wicket. Morkel was denied the first five-wicket haul in Twenty20 internationals when umpire Billy Doctrove ruled that the delivery that bowled Mark Gillespie in Morkel's last over was a no-ball. New Zealand fell away after their sturdy opening stand and they depended heavily on Craig McMillan's unbeaten 48 to post a respectable total. McMillan and Jacob Oram (15) shared 41 for the fifth wicket, New Zealand's only other noteworthy stand. In South Africa's reply, Kemp and Mark Boucher (23) put on 65 for the fourth wicket after their side had slipped to 45 for three. Shaun Pollock (16 not out) helped Kemp complete the job with an unbroken stand of 48 and South Africa won with five balls to spare
