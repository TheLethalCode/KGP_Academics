<TITLE> India's Hindu nationalists eye revival at key meet </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's Hindu nationalist opposition meets this weekend to resolve a leadership vacuum dogging them for years, and prepare for possible early elections against a ruling coalition hit by political infighting. Around 200 leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will travel to Bhopal for a meeting of its national executive. That could be one of its last major party gatherings before elections if the ruling Congress-led coalition calls a snap vote for early next year. Despite struggling in polls, BJP leaders say they can sniff electoral victory as Congress battles its own leftist allies over a nuclear deal with the United States. A BJP victory could swing India to a stronger pro-market and pro-US agenda after several years of stagnation in economic reforms and problems over improving relations with Washington, partly due to the government's need to mollify communist allies. The inability to satisfy them on the nuclear issue has led to the increased speculation about an early vote. That standoff has coincided with unease at inflation, worries over farming conditions and accusations the government blasphemed by questioning the existence of Lord Ram, a Hindu god. "We are expecting a general election any time," said Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, BJP vice-president. "This is why this meeting is important. The government is shooting itself in the feet." But delegates have a job to do. Since its shock 2004 election defeat, the pro-free market party that hailed a "shining India" has appeared divided, rudderless and lacking a clear strategy. HINDU REVIVAL The party rose to prominence in the early 1990s on the back of a Hindu revivalist movement, and ruled India from 1998 to 2004. It moderated its hardline rhetoric in a bid to expand its base, but has since failed to define an alternative political identity. Its hopes of gaining seats at a key state election in Uttar Pradesh in May were dashed and a poll this month showed Congress and its allies could win a majority in a new general election. Many blame the lack of a strong leader. BJP president Rajnath Singh was appointed as a consensus candidate nearly two years ago to resolve a split between hardline Hindu nationalists and a more pragmatic wing. Former Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee is the party's most popular figure, but he is now seen as too old and frail. Attention is on parliamentary opposition leader L.K Advani, a shrewd politician and former hardliner who now cultivates a moderate image. "If (Vajpayee) is not available then it's Advani. There is no third choice," said former BJP finance minister Yashwant Sinha. The three-day meeting could see attempts to declare Advani as prime ministerial candidate despite some opposition. "In private, what everyone is talking about is the leadership issue," said Swapan Dasgupta, an expert on the BJP. "It's the main bottleneck and there may be an attempt to resolve this at the weekend. The party is 80-20 in favour of Advani." The party's ideological parent, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), has reservations about Advani's new moderate image but has no viable alternatives. Younger leaders lack political weight to beat Advani or win a national election. "There no choice but Advani," said Yashwant Deshmukh, director of the C-Voter polling firm. IT'S THE ECONOMY, STUPID The BJP hopes to capitalise on signs Congress's support has at least peaked or may be weakening, as an economic boom is perceived as having left hundreds of millions of people out. A controversy this month, when the government filed an affidavit saying some of Hinduism's most important religious texts were not evidence gods existed, played into BJP's hands. But the Hindu nationalism card -- the concept of "Hindutva" that sees India as more of a Hindu than secular nation -- can win them only a minority of the national vote, pollsters say. The party must further appeal to both a growing middle class as well as millions of rural and poorer Indians. "Hindu nationalism is not an election issue for us," said Naqvi. "The issues are internal security, farmers, price rises." Even if polls are trusted -- and some analysts doubt them -- the BJP may squeeze some hope from the surveys. "It has no reason to be disheartened with its poll performance given the party's incoherence in recent years. Despite everything, they are still in the race," said Dasgupta. The BJP already controls 10 states directly or through coalitions and will try to forge alliances with regional parties to strengthen its National Democratic Alliance coalition. "There's a good chance of them strengthening their alliance in the months ahead. Regional parties know their political longevity depends on these kind of alliances," said Deshmukh
