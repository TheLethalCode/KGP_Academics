 Dhaka, Sep 21 (bdnews24.com)  The police Friday charged baton on hundreds of Islamist demonstrators when they marched to besiege the daily Prothom Alo office in Karwan Bazar in the city, leaving 25 injured. The demonstrators took out processions from the north gate of Baitul Mukarram national mosque at about 2pm amid the state of emergency and marched towards the paper's office. The police intercepted the protesters when the processions reached the Shishu Park in Shahbagh. The agitators wrestled with the police and broke into a security barricade there. The police clubbed and dispersed the protesters who retreated to Dhaka University area. The demonstrators demanded closure of publication of the Prothom Alo, which they termed a "Friend of the Jews and Christians", for carrying a rogue cartoon strip in its satire magazine Aalpin that hurt "religious sensibilities". Later, they took position on the road in front of the BIRDEM Hospital and chanted slogans including the one: "The den of Prothom Alo will no more be in Bangladesh." The police again charged baton and chased the protesters to Paribagh area. They held prayers there at about 2:45pm and ended the "siege programme". The police mounted guard in front of the Prothom Alo office since morning. Protests also were raised during the Friday prayers at the Ambar Shah Mosque in Karwan Bazar against the publication of "objectionable cartoon". The mosque's chief cleric said it was an offence that could not be forgiven. He, however, asked devotees not to take out any procession or resort to violence. Earlier, many Islamist organisations including Hizbut Tahrir have started demonstrations in Baitul Mukarram after Friday prayers. Hundreds of demonstrators gathered at the north gate of the national mosque at around 1:25pm just after the prayers ended. Hizbut Tahrir had burnt an effigy titled "Matiur-Mahfuz" (Prothom Alo editor Matiur Rahman and publisher Mahfuz Anam) in the mosque complex. Islami Oikya Andolon, Islamic Constitution Movement, Khelafat Andolan and Islami Chhatra Majlish also carried banners in the processions. The processions demanded closure of the publication of the Prothom Alo. A huge number of riot police deployed in the area played the silent spectators during the demonstrations. The protestors took out processions from Baitul Mukarram north gate to the High Court area. In Sylhet, some copies of the Prothom Alo were burnt in front of the Kudratullah Mosque at the city point area after Friday prayers. The police foiled attempts by the demonstrators to take out processions in Court Masjid area, according to bdnews24.com correspondent. Three workers of Hizbut Tahrir, an Islamist outfit, were detained when they were circulating leaflets urging protest processions towards the Prothom Alo office in the northeastern city, the police said. The leaflet has also been put on the organisation's website. Kotwali police chief Nasimul Islam said Abdullah Al Mahmud, Syed Mohidul Islam and Mushfiqur Rahman had been arrested on charges of feeding propaganda during the state of emergency. The arrestees, who claimed to be students of Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, had been kept at the Kotwali Police Station. No was filed against them until 2:30pm. RAB and the police are guarding the Prothom Alo's Sylhet office and main city areas. Bangladesh Workers Party in a press statement Friday welcomed the withdrawal of the issue of satire magazine Aalpin, the offering of public apology twice by the Prothom Alo, the action against the freelance cartoonist and effective steps by the government. The party expressed deep concern at the statement and attempt to create tension among the people by those linked with BNP-Jamaat-e-Islami alliance over the rogue cartoon strip. It said in November 1998 during the tenure of BNP-Jamaat-e-Islami government a similar satire was published in "Kishore Kantha", a publication of Jamaat's student front Islami Chhatra Shibir. On Thursday, the publication of Aalpin was suspended temporarily and cartoonist Arifur Rahman arrested. The government also banned the Eid issue of Bangla-language weekly magazine Shaptahik 2000 Thursday, saying a biographical write-up by exiled poet Daud Haider titled "Sutanuti Samachar" could hurt religious feelings of the people. The Daily Star editor Mahfuz Anam is the publisher of both Prothom Alo and Shaptahik 2000. Earlier on Thursday, the Dhaka district magistrate asked the publisher of the Prothom Alo to explain why the satirical magazine should not cease to exist. A defamation case was filed the same day against the editor, publisher and freelance cartoonist of the Bangla-language daily with a Chittagong court. Patiya Al Jameya Al Islam Madrasa's administrative officer Mohammad Reza filed the case that cited "elements of sedition" in the publication of the controversial cartoon strip. The Chittagong court accepted the case and fixed Sept 30 for the next hearing. Conspirators wanted to throw the country into chaos, Reza alleged. A second case was filed in Comilla by a member of the Bar. Identical charges were made. The magistrate ordered the police to take action. The editor of the Prothom Alo attended an iftar organised by the Islamic Foundation Thursday evening and apologised to the Islamic leaders present there. Tejgaon police chief Jane Alam Thursday filed a case against Arifur Rahman, the cartoonist, with the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka. Police arrested Arif, who is now in jail, at his Uttara home on Sept 18. bdnews24.
