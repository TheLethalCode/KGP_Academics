<TITLE> Weak dollar, high oil brings inflation worry </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Sept 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Share markets generally rose on Friday despite growing worries about inflation fuelled by the dollar hitting another new low against the euro and oil trading near record peaks. Bond markets were weaker on the inflation concerns. The dollar continued its downward path following the US Federal Reserve's interest rate cut on Tuesday, which makes returns on the currency less rewarding. The euro hit a new all-time high of $1.4120. It also hit a 31-year low against the Canadian dollar and was closing in on an all-time low against a basket of six major currencies. "We're still in the aftermath of the US rate cut, with interest rate differentials leading to dollar weakness," said Marcus Hettinger, global FX strategist at Credit Suisse in Zurich. The Fed move was designed to restore confidence in the financial system after severe liquidity and credit shortages battered some institutions and unnerved markets. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 0.3 percent, recouping some of Thursday's 0.7 percent fall. "Strong global growth, reasonable valuations and strong balance sheets underpin our belief in a continuation of the structural bull market," European equity strategists at Goldman Sachs said in a note. MSCI's measure of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan was at an all-time high, although Tokyo's Nikkei average ended the day down 0.6 percent at 16,312.61. Oil prices slipped but held near $82 a barrel on Friday, after hitting a record above $84 the previous day as a tropical depression forced the shutdown of output in the Gulf of Mexico before peak winter fuel demand. US crude for November delivery, the new front month, dipped 31 cents to $81.47 a barrel. London Brent November crude edged down 35 cents to $78.74, after 62-cent gains on Thursday. Oil has traded above $80 for the past week, despite OPEC's decision last week to raise output from November, on thinning US inventories, a weakening dollar, the US interest rate cut which eased fears of a recession and on storm risks. This has begun to increase fears of inflation, particularly in the United States where a weak dollar also makes foreign-made goods more expensive. Partly as a result, longer-dated euro zone government bond prices fell. The December Bund future was at 112.48, down 21 ticks from the previous session's settlement close, having earlier hit a five-week low of 112.24. The 10-year cash yield was up at 4.36 percent, a fresh one-month high, while two-year yields were at 4.09 perce
