India booked a final date with traditional rivals Pakistan in Johannesburg on Monday thanks to Yuvraj's blazing knock of 70 runs off just 30 deliveries. India amassed 188 for five and Australia could not keep up the required pace and replied with 173 for seven. Yuvraj shared 84 runs off 40 balls with Robin Uthappa (34) for the third wicket after India won the toss and chose to bat. The 25-year-old, who smashed six sixes in an over against England earlier in the week, launched the Australia bowlers for five fours and five sixes during his entertaining knock. Matthew Hayden (62) and Andrew Symonds (43) added 66 for the third wicket but Australia could mount no other significant partnerships.
