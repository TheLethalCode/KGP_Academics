 Dhaka, Sept 23 (bdnews24.com) - Stocks rallied for a third day Sunday, paced by retail and institutional buying into bank, cement and mutual-fund shares following a market correction early last week. Buying pressure led to a market surge in the first 30 minutes of trading before settling down by midday trade. All indices finished upbeat toward closing. "It's a turnaround from the previous day's corrections," said Yawer Sayeed, who helps manage about Tk 800 million in funds at AIMS of Bangladesh.
