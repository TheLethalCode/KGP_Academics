<TITLE> SC set to rule on bail wrangle </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept (bdnews24.com) The Appellate Division decides Thursday whether the High Court can consider bail appeals under the emergency powers rules. High Court judges Nazrul Islam Chowdhury and SM Emdadul Huq delivered a verdict on April 24 on a bail appeal, stating that the HC could consider bail applications under the emergency rules. The April 24 verdict prompted a counter-appeal from the government in the Appellate Division in a bid to scuttle the plaintiff's bail. The full bench of the Appellate Division, headed by chief justice Md Ruhul Amin, will preside over the government's appeal. Additional attorney general Salahuddin Ahmed had represented the government while barrister Rafique-ul Huq and advocate Abdul Matin Khosru had stood for the plaintiff. The legal issue came to a head when a man, named Maijuddin, filed an appeal for bail from the High Court in a case that involves the supply of adulterated oil, which had been covered by the emergency powers rules. The legal wrangle involved senior lawyers in court arguments in connection with the case. To make the process of bail appeals more stringent, the government amended the Emergency Powers Ordinance for a second time on March 21. The result: cases involving bail appeals became bogged down in an uncertain legal territory. In a related move, the High Court had earlier granted bail to former minister Moudud Ahmed in a case that involves illegal possession of alcohol. The government subsequently appealed to the Appellate Division against the HC judgment. bdnews24
