 TOKYO/HONG KONG, Sept 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks stalled after scaling an all-time high on Friday as worries about US inflation grew, fuelled by the dollar hitting a record low against the euro and oil climbing to new peaks overnight. Japan's benchmark 10-year yield jumped to a five-week high of 1.7000 percent, tracking a surge in US yields on the inflation worry. Spot gold usually seen as an inflation hedge, held near a 28-year high of $738.30 set on Thursday. European stocks are expected to open slightly lower, with financial bookmakers picking London's FTSE, Frankfurt's DAX and Paris' CAC 40 to all open 5-11 points lower. A 50 basis point cut in the US fed funds rate on Tuesday helped shore up confidence that a recession could be avoided in the world's largest economy but battered the dollar and increased concerns about economy-damaging inflation. "Oil prices moving up and the weaker dollar may have raised some inflationary concerns (in the US) and there are still concerns about the impact of the US subprime lending scenario," said Tony Russell, senior equities adviser at ABN AMRO Morgans. "Profits are going to be harder to come by this year so you're likely to see the major funds taking profits at any opportunity." At 0621 GMT, MSCI's measure of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan had inched up just 0.07 percent, following Thursday's 1.2 percent rise, while Tokyo's Nikkei average ended the day down 0.6 percent at 16,312.61. The MSCI index touched a fresh high of 508.45 points and has now completely recovered from the 21 percent plunge between July 24 and Aug. 17, when fears of a global credit squeeze sent investors scurrying for the safety of safer assets. The dollar touched another record low against the euro and a 31-year low versus the Canadian dollar as investors continued to dump the US currency after the aggressive rate cut by the Federal Reserve earlier this week. "The euro has gone through the $1.40 level, so dollar selling momentum is continuing. We could be entering a phase of full-fledged dollar weakness," said a trader at a Japanese bank. The dollar climbed above $1.41 and China's yuan also hit a post-revaluation high 7.5030/dollar in a response to broad dollar weakness. Against the yen, the dollar fetched about 114.74 yen after dipping below 114 yen overnight and the single European currency bought nearly 162 yen near Thursday's high of about 162.40 yen. Asian exporters were hit by a weak dollar, which tends to hurt their overseas earnings and erode their export competitiveness, on top of renewed U.S. worries. Investors sold exporters such as Samsung Electronics, Honda Motor, Canon Inc and Sony "There really isn't enough energy in the market to take the Nikkei over the 16,500 level, which is about where investors are moving in to lock in profits," said Masatoshi Yano, senior manager of investment information at Tokai Tokyo Securities. Japanese markets will be closed on Monday for a public holiday. Comments from Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke on Thursday also did no favours for markets. The Fed chief said the rate cut this week was to brace the US economy against damage from financial turmoil, but warned the outlook remained uncertain. But bucking the generally softer trend, energy stocks such as Japan's INPEX Holdings and Australia's oil and gas producer Woodside Petroleum gained ground with US crude trading near $82 a barrel. Crude hit a life high of $84.10 on Thursday in its seventh straight record-breaking session as output from the Gulf of Mexico was shut on forecast of a tropical depression churning through the regi
