 Mahbub Alam Rony bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, Sept 22 (bdnews24.com) -- Two consecutive floods have ruined nearly two-thirds of the country's handlooms putting weavers in a deep state of distress. Bangladesh Handloom Board says that 2.24 lakh weavers in 70 upazilas of 25 districts have been badly hurt by the calamity. In addition to other steps to help the flood victims, the government has allotted Tk 2 crore for the maimed textiles industry. However, industry authorities deem this amount inadequate. They say that even though only Tk 2 crore has been allocated to the sector, the government cannot confirm when it will disburse the money to the weavers. The flood-affected weavers are only to get VGF rice, while the farmers will get free saplings and loans under the plan. Abdul Hakim, chairman of Bangladesh Handloom Board, told bdnews24.com: "For the affected handloom owners, we first asked the government for a grant of Tk 28.22 crore. The government initially allocated Tk 2 crore. With the help of the local authorities, a list of the most-affected weavers is being made. They will be reimbursed the moment the money is received." He, however, had no idea when the money would reach them. The chairman further said, "The workers will be provided rice through VGF cards. It will be distributed as soon as the food and disaster management ministry sanctions it." Asked about the extent of damage to the handloom sector, he said: "We have not yet taken stock of the damage to the weavers. It will be assessed when the flood water recedes." A census in 2003 showed there were more than 5.5 lakh looms working in 1.83 lakh handloom factories. Of them, 1.69 lakh looms have been ruined in the latest bout of floods. According to the data, the floods have destroyed around 33.58 percent of the weaving machinery. MR Shahid, director general of Bangladesh Handloom Board, said: "A rudimentary survey shows that 28,226 weaving families and 2.24 lakh workers in 25 districts have been affected by the floods." According to the handloom board, the affected districts are Sirajganj, Pabna, Lalmonirhat, Kurigram, Rangpur, Bogra, Gaibandha, Dhaka, Munshiganj, Narsingdi, Tangail, Barisal, Narayanganj, Comilla, Brahmanbaria, Jhinaidaha, Faridpur, Madaripur, Shariatpur, Jamalpur, Kishoreganj, Chuadanga, Kushtia, Rajbari and Manikganj. In Sirajganj, the twin floods have affected 2.5 lakh weaving families in eight upazilas of the district. They are worried that they will not get necessary capital to restart factories. In the Sadar upazila of the district's Sayedabad, general secretary of the Handloom Owners Association, Abdul Gani Molla, claimed that the floods had resulted in a minimum loss of Tk 200 crore. Dyes and threads have been lost along with machinery. To get the machines up and running again, up to Tk 10,000 will be needed per machine, he said. He said that since July 26, production in most of the weaving factories had stopped leading to a further loss of Tk 100 crore, and the total loss incurred by the handloom industry because of the floods would add up to Tk 300 crore. Abdul Gani Mollah said: "It is unlikely that all damages can be recovered. However, with government grants and interest-free loans, weavers may be able to rebuild their businesses." Jahrul, Sekendar Ali, Rubel, Khalil Munsi, Shams, Haran Pramanik and 50 other workers of Sayedabad said they had been living on loans from local loan sharks. Sultan Mahmud, public relations officer of Bangladesh Handloom Board's Sirajganj Sadar Basic Centre said: "In the two spells of floods nearly 1.5 lakh weavers have suffered losses of nearly Tk 180 crore in Sadar, Belkuchi, Kamarkhand and Kajipur upazilas." "We have submitted statistics on the losses to Bangladesh Handloom Board. We have also applied for one lakh VGF cards for the workers. We have received assurances," he added. Wajed Ali Mollah, who works for Shahjahan Basic Centre said: "About 50,000 weaving families in Shahjahadpur and Chouhali upazilas have suffered Tk 20 crore in losses." Azizur Rahman, liaison officer of Ullapara Basic Centre said: "The floods have caused damage worth Tk 8.5 crore to 10,000 weavers in Ullapara and Raiganj upazilas." Handloom owner Rashedul Hasan Siraj of Betil village in Chouhali upazila said: "I had 10 handlooms. After the first flood swamped those machines, I borrowed Tk 20,000 from a local mahajan to restart my business. But within 10 days, all the handlooms were again submerged." "Within a span of five months, the prices of one pound of thread were raised from Tk 25 to Tk 35, while dye prices rose by Tk 10 to Tk 60 per pound," he added. "We need government support to survive. The prices of thread and dye need to be lowered." "The second flood was more devastating. All the handlooms in this area were submerged," said Korayesh Sarkar, owner of a weaving business in Belkuchi upazila. In Pabna, the second bout of flood has made a few lakh weaver families in nine upazilas destitute. After the first flood, weavers borrowed from loan sharks and restarted business, but the second flood crushed their chances. bdnews24.com/corr/
