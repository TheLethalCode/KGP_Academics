 Dhaka, September 19 (bdnews24.com)  Secretary general in-charge of the breakaway BNP faction Ashraf Hossain Wednesday asked the government to completely lift the ban on politics for a BNP council to take place. He said for a big political party such as BNP it was not possible contact leaders and workers scattered across the country unless the ban on politics was lifted totally. "We'll hold BNP council after reviewing the real situation around once the ban on politics totally goes. The BNP reform proposals will also be discussed at the council." He took his usual dig at acting BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain. "We do not accept Khandaker Delwar Hossain as our secretary general. Unfortunately, Delwar is intimidating our leaders and party workers and threatening them with even ousters," said Ashraf. On the breakaway faction's secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan's meeting with other leaders in Singapore, Ashraf said Bhuiyan had gone abroad for treatment. It was only natural that people would be seeing him there to enquire about his wellbeing. He denied Bhuiyan had any formal meeting there with other political leaders. He said doctors in Singapore was doing different tests on Bhuiyan and looking into the possibilities of prostate diseases. Ashraf said there was no provision in the BNP constitution for chief coordinator for the central committee. bdnews2
