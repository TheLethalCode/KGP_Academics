 LONDON, Sept 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Around 600 people die in state custody every year and some deaths could have been prevented, a newly formed campaign group said on Friday. Data from the Forum for Preventing Deaths in Custody, includes deaths from suicides, murders and natural causes in prisons, police stations, immigration detention centres, young offenders' institutes and secure mental hospitals. The forum said some could have been prevented and called for a "more robust and joined-up approach to information-sharing between agencies". John Wadham, forum chairman and legal director of the incoming Commission for Equality and Human Rights, said the number of deaths in custody was a "measure of a civilised society" and that 600 a year was too many.

Wadham said the group had been unable to conduct research as it has "no capacity to monitor or report on the recommendations that may be made as result of investigations, inspections or inquests". The government said it May it would review the forum's resources. Justice minister Maria Eagle said on Friday: "There are clearly lessons arising from many of the deaths in custody each year and the forum plays an important part in helping organisations to learn from these." She said she would meet Wadham to discuss the issues arising from the report. The core membership of the forum includes representatives from the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Independent Police Complaints Commission, the Prison Service, the Border and Immigration Agency, the Home Office and the Department of Health, among othe
