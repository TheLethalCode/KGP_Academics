<TEXT>
 MADRID, Sept 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news from the Primera Liga before this weekend's matches: Argentina forward Lionel Messi has defended team mate Ronaldinho after the Brazilian was substituted for the third game in a row in Barcelona's 3-0 Champions League win over Olympique Lyon midweek amid whistles from the Barca fans. "He is still the best player in the world," Messi said. "I don't know why people whistle him. Ronaldinho can have off moments but he always looks to do the best for the team." Sevilla, with two wins from two this season, visit the Nou Camp on Saturday. Barcelona captain Carles Puyol has returned to training with the squad, but is not expected to make the side. He tore a knee ligament in a post-season friendly against Mamelodi Sundowns. Real Madrid coach Bernd Schuster may have to improvise in the centre of defence with Pepe recovering from a muscle injury and Christoph Metzelder suffering bruising to his knee. Sergio Ramos or Argentine Gabriel Heinze, who has recovered from a muscle strain, could move across from fullback to cover alongside Fabio Cannavaro. Valencia goalkeeper Santiago Canizares has a thigh strain and German Timo Hildebrand is likely to make his first league start since his pre-season arrival from VfB Stuttgart. Getafe will be without suspended former Real Madrid midfielder Esteban Granero for the visit of Deportivo Coruna. Last season's King's Cup finalists have had four players sent off in their opening three league games. Atletico Madrid midfielder Jurado picked up an ankle ligament injury in their 4-0 win over Erciyesspor in the UEFA Cup and is unlikely to make the visit of Racing Santander
