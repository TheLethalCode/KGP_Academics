 BEIJING, Sept 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Chinese court has sentenced a former bank manager to death for taking payoffs that led to losses of 700 million yuan ($93 million), the official Xinhua news agency reported on Saturday. Huang Jinjiang, who headed a branch of Agricultural Bank of China in the southwestern province of Sichuan, accepted 7 million yuan in bribes between 1993 and 1997 from a local firm that was seeking to borrow money, Xinhua quoted court sources as saying. Huang then signed off on bank drafts in the company's favour that resulted in losses of 700 million yuan, Xinhua said. It gave no details but said three of Huang's colleagues would be tried separately for taking bribes worth 3.12 million yuan. ($1=7.502 Yuan)
