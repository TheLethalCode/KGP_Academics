<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 22 (bdnews24.com) - The FBCCI is set to appeal to the government for the release of businessmen arrested with no specific charges. The country's apex organisation for trade and industry took the decision at an emergency meeting of its council of directors Saturday. The federation will appeal for the release of two of their former presidents as well as two sitting directors and several other businessmen against whom no specific allegations have yet been made. In a statement, the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry said: "Their release would protect man jobs." "A large number of people are employed in firms whose owners have been detained or are on the run." "These organisations play an important role in the economy of the country," it said. FBCCI leaders welcomed the central bank's efforts to keep these organisations operational although they called for a simplification of certain legal issues to aid the process. The statement said: "The import and supply situation of different commodities at the private level has improved recently." "The meeting emphasised the rapid and large-scale imports of commodities at the governmental level," it said. The FBCCI also called for increased coordination in market monitoring to keep the prices of market essentials down. FBCCI president Mir Nasir Hossain chaired the meeting. bdnews
