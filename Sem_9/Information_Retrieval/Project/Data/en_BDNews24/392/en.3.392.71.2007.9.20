 Dhaka, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com) -- The case, filed by the Anticorruption Commission against Sheikh Hasina on charges of corruption in power projects, has been brought under the emergency powers rules. The embattled former prime minister's lawyers said that there was a possibility of a writ petition being filed with the High Court challenging its legality. ACC secretary Md Mokhles Ur Rahman in a regular briefing Thursday told reporters that the commission had approved the taking of the case under the emergency powers rules on an appeal by investigation officer Morshed Alam, ACC deputy director. Following approval of the commission, the case was included in the emergency powers rules. Earlier, two cases filed against Hasina by businessmen Azam Jahangir Chowdhury and Tajul Islam were also brought under the EPR. Two writ petitions were filed with the High Court challenging their legality. ACC assistant director SM Sabbir Hossain filed the case with Tejgaon Police Station on Sept 2 against Hasina on charges of taking Tk 3 crore in bribe. According to case details, seven people, including Hasina, took Tk 3 crore from Summit Group and United Group, local representatives of Wartsila Power Development Ltd Consortium in return for giving them the work of setting up barge-mounted power plants in Khulna, Shikalbaha and Haripur. In the case, it was alleged that Hasina had taken the money to buy a house for Bangabandhu Memorial Trust in Dhaka. Former Supreme Court Bar Association president barrister Shafique Ahmed told bdnews24.com that the legality of bringing the case under EPR might be challenged in the High Court. He is a senior lawyer of the panel of lawyers conducting Hasina's appeal for quashing three corruption cases, including the MiG-29 purchase scam, against her in the High Court. Barrister Shafique said a decision would be taken in consultation with other lawyers after getting necessary documents. Another member of the panel, advocate SM Rezaul Karim, said the case was taken under the EPR to scuttle scope for Hasina to defend herself in court. bdnews
