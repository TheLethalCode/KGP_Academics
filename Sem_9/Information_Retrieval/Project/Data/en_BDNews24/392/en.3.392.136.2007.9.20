<TITLE> Grant to take over as Chelsea coach-BBC </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chelsea's director of football Avram Grant is to take over as coach following the shock departure of Jose Mourinho, the BBC reported on Thursday. The club would not immediately confirm the appointment officially but Chelsea sources said it would not be a surprise if Grant, who is close to billionaire owner Roman Abramovich, took on the role. Chelsea announced early on Thursday that they and Mourinho, who won two Premier League titles, two League Cups and an FA Cup in his three years in charge, had parted company by mutual consent. The BBC added that Steve Clarke, a former Chelsea defender with several years service on the coaching staff, would remain as assistant coach, a job he had done under Mourinho. Grant, an Israeli and former coach of his country's national side, was appointed director of football in the close season and had been shadowing Mourinho. He sat behind the Portuguese in the dug-out at matches and attended training sessions. Mourinho had opposed his appointment during a long standoff with Abramovich last season but appeared to have accepted his arrival at the start of the season. Grant, 51, got to know Abramovich through contacts in Israel where the Russian, who bought Chelsea in 2003, has taken an interest in football. Grant, who moved to Chelsea from Portsmouth where he was a technical director, began to have an influence by giving Abramovich informal advice before his appointment. The Israeli accompanied the squad to the United States for a pre-season tour shortly after he was hired in July. Mourinho said at the time Grant was there to give support in different areas of the club and that it was not a problem. But Mourinho also said he would not accept interference in his own job
