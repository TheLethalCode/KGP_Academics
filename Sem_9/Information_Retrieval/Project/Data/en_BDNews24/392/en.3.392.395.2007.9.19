 Dhaka, Sept 19 (bdnews24.com) --The visiting US deputy assistant secretary, John Gastright, Wednesday said the United States "is not dictating" measures for the restoration of democracy in Bangladesh. Following his meeting with the chief election commissioner Tuesday, Gastright said the US government "looked forward to additional steps by Bangladesh to restore democracy as soon as possible". The visiting official failed to elaborate on Tuesday's call for "additional measures". Gastright spoke to reporters following a meeting with foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury at the foreign office. The US official said: "For some reason some people got the impression that I went in and dictated measures. This is not at all the case." "The US is not here to dictate. The US is here to listen, to hear the caretaker government's plans to develop democracy for the people of Bangladesh," he said. On the detention of Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia, Gastright said: "Our position on the arrest of individuals whether they are former prime ministers or not, is that the government must respect due process, they must respect human rights." "I am very hopeful and expect that the government will do that," he said. "The United States supports the caretaker government's efforts in what they are trying to do, we support the electoral reforms they are trying to achieve," said Gastright. Following the media briefing, the American Embassy's public affairs division distributed a written press statement. It read: "Gastright emphasised the importance of restoring democracy in Bangladesh as soon as possible." "He assured the foreign adviser and the foreign secretary that the United States, along with others in the international community, remains eager to assist Bangladesh in successfully holding democratic elections before the end of 2008." The text added the deputy assistant secretary also expressed appreciation for continued US-Bangladesh collaboration in the global war on terror. Gastright looks after the affairs of Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan at the US state department. bdn
