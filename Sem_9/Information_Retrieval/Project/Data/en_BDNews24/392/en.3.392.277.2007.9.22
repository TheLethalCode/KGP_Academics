 Dhaka, Sept 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  The weather office Saturday upgraded the "local warning" for seaports to four as the monsoon deep depression in the Bay of Bengal is likely to intensify. "A squally weather may affect the maritime ports," the Meteorological Department said in a bulletin. Over 150 fishermen went missing after 15 fishing trawlers sank in the Bay during a storm overnight, officials said Saturday. Fishermen who had managed to return to shore said they had seen several fishing boats sink in the storm. Strong winds and high waves were preventing rescuers from launching a search for the missing fishermen. "A search will start, only when the situation improves," Selim Khan, an administrative officer in the coastal Barguna district told Reuters. The storm churning in the Bay is heading towards India's eastern coastal state of Orissa. A trawler with 14 fishermen on board sank Friday in the deep sea, 30 kilometres off Kuakata. Nasir, sailor of the disaster-hit trawler FB Jahangir, went to sea with 14 fishermen Thursday and the trawler sank Friday evening, Nimai Chandra, general secretary of Mohipur Fisheries Traders Association, said. Patuakhali river port suspended launch services on internal routes because of the bad weather. Low-lying areas in Patuakhali were inundated with waves four to five feet higher than water level. bdnews24.com's Bhola correspondent said that at least three trawlers sank early Saturday in Sonarchor area. Twenty-one fishermen of the trawlers are still missing. bdnews24.co
