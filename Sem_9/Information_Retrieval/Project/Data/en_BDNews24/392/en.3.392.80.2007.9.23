 MILAN, Sept 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - AC Milan's sluggish start to the Serie A season continued on Saturday when Parma held the European champions to an exciting 1-1 draw at the San Siro. Milan's third consecutive league draw leaves them sixth with six points from four games, three points behind leaders AS Roma. The Rome side defend a 100 percent record against Juventus, who also have six points, at the Olympic Stadium on Sunday. Milan had Parma pinned back for most of the first half but had to wait until just before the break for their reward when Dutch midfielder Clarence Seedorf pounced as Paolo Castellini tried to clear the rebound from a Filippo Inzaghi shot. Parma midfielder Stefano Morrone and Brazilian forward Reginaldo fluffed chances to equalise either side of halftime. The home side seemed to tire as the match went on and Parma capitalised in the 73rd minute when Andrea Pisanu turned in a Reginaldo cross. Parma's Portuguese defender Fernando Couto headed narrowly wide and Milan striker Inzaghi fired a close-range shot at goalkeeper Nicola Pavarini in the closing stages. Earlier, Udinese beat Reggina 2-0 thanks to two magnificent goals by Italy striker Antonio Di Natale. The rest of the league programme will be played on Sunday with champions Inter Milan visiting Livorno
