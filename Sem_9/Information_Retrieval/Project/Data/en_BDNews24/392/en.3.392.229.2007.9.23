 Dhaka, Sept 23 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League Sunday said it was disappointed with the Supreme Court agreeing to hear appeals of the five detained death convicts. It said the ruling had fallen short of their expectations. Acting AL president Zillur Rahman told reporters: "I don't think it was rational on the part of the court to accept the petitions for leave to appeal filed by the convicts in Bangabandhu murder case. "The whole nation has been disappointed and everyone is heartbroken," Zillur claimed. "We'll continue our struggle against the move and we shall emerge winners in the end," he said. He said the Awami League was a disciplined political party with a chain of command firmly in place. "We don't want to break the law. We'd like the hearing of the appeals to be over as soon as possible." Zillur said they had been in touch with the 14-party alliance partners. Tofail Ahmed, a member of the policymaking presidium, said, "There hasn't been much coordination among the alliance partners in the past months because of a ban on indoor politics since the emergency rules had been clamped." "The party has vested the responsibility of overseeing the revival of the 14-party alliance on me. The person who was in charge of coordinating the alliance is in jail at the moment," he added. Tofail said he had initial consultations with all the allies and briefed the acting AL president on the developments. He said the AL would also sit with the like-minded political parties outside the combine who espoused the spirit of the independence war. Tofail said they would start meeting its partners on Sept 29. "We would like to be in agreement on what we would discuss with the Election Commission," he said. bdnews2
