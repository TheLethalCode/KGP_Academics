<TITLE> Afghanistan hopeful of BRAC aid worker's freedom: adviser </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com)--The Afghan government has expressed optimism in the ongoing effort to release abducted BRAC official Nurul Islam, an adviser said Thursday. Foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury told reporters: "The Afghan foreign office has communicated to us today that they are very hopeful about the release of Nurul Islam." The adviser also said he had talked to the Pakistan High Commissioner Thursday about the abduction of Nurul Islam. "If Nurul Islam is not freed, chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed will talk to Afghan President Hamid Karzai on the sidelines of a meeting of the UN General Assembly on Sept 27," Iftekhar said. "It is very difficult to say who kidnapped Nurul Islam. The time has not yet come to tell BRAC not to send Bangladeshis to work in Afghanistan," he said. Nurul's abduction follows the death of Abdul Alim, another BRAC official, who was gunned down by unidentified assailants on Sept 12. BRAC, one of the largest NGOs in the world, employs about 4,000 workers in Afghanistan, including over 200 Bangladeshis. BRAC works in the fields of microcredit, health, education and women's empowerment. bdn
