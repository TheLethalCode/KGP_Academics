 Dhaka, Sept 19 (bdnews24.com) The High Court Wednesday delayed by a week the final hearing on a writ appeal of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina against Anti-Corruption Commission seeking her wealth statement. The same day, the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court, Dhaka set Oct 4 for accepting the chargesheet in connection with a Tk 3 crore extortion case against the Awami League chief, which was filed by businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury. The High Court bench of justices Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Zubayer Rahman put off the hearing on an appeal by deputy attorney general Syeda Afsar Zahan. Zahan pleaded with the court for pushing the hearing by one more week on the grounds that attorney general Fida M Kamal would not be able to be present if the hearing had taken place now because of his sickness. Hasina's lawyers barristers Rafiq-ul Haque, Shafiq Ahmed and Sheikh Fazle Noor Tapas opposed the government appeal. "The court has given the government the last chance," Tapas later told bdnews24.com. Hasina was arrested on July 16 and sent to the special jail after her cousin and Awami League leader Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim was quoted by the police to have confessed to the extortion. The ACC served a notice on Hasina the next day, asking the AL chief to give an account of assets. On August 7, the HC froze the ACC notice after Hasina's writ petition, and ordered the anti-graft watchdog and the government to explain why the ACC notice was not unlawful. Azam Jahangir Chowdhury, managing director of business firm Eastcoast Trading Ltd, filed a case on June 13 with Gulshan Police Station, accusing Hasina of taking Tk 3 crore in bribe to allow power plants. The same day another businessman, Noor Ali, filed another case with Tajgaon Police Station. He charged Hasina with accepting Tk 5 crore in bribe in return for allowing installation of power plants during her days as prime minister. Hasina appealed the High Court against the government taking the cases under the cover of emergency powers rules on July 16. HC bailed Hasina in Chowdhury's case on July 30 and in Ali's case on Aug 7, but on Aug 27 a full bench of the Appellate Division stayed the bails. bdnew
