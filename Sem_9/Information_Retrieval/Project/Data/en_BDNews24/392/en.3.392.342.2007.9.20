 RAMALLAH, West Bank, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice assured Palestinians on Thursday that Washington intended that a planned Middle East peace conference should put them firmly on the road towards statehood. But Rice gave no sign, after talks in the occupied West Bank with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and in Israel, that any progress had been made in forging a common position that would be presented to the international gathering. The United States, she said, hoped a document Israel and the Palestinians have been trying to draft for the conference would lead to "serious negotiations for the establishment of a Palestinian state as soon as possible". Rice told a news conference: "I will work, I know that the president and (Israeli) Prime Minister (Ehud) Olmert will work, and that their teams will work very aggressively, very urgently, to lay the groundwork for a successful meeting." Olmert, who has been meeting regularly with Abbas ahead of the conference expected in Washington around mid-November, has cautioned against seeking more than a declaration of principles for establishing a Palestinian state. Abbas has made clear he wants a deal that goes beyond previous agreements on the broad outlines of how the 60-year-old conflict, revolving around borders and the future of Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees, can be resolved. The Palestinian leader told the news conference he wanted to reach with Olmert "an agreement with a clear timeframe" for implementation. Rice reiterated that US President George W. Bush had no intention of convening a Middle East conference that would serve only as a "photo-op". After her talks with Abbas, Rice planned to end her two-day visit by seeing Olmert for a second time. At the news conference, Abbas said Israel's decision on Wednesday to declare the Hamas-run Gaza Strip an "enemy entity" in the wake of frequent cross-border rocket attacks would "complicate further an already tense situation on the ground". The West Bank-based Palestinian government has already said it wants Washington to press Israel not to cut energy and other supplies to the 1.5 million people of Gaza, despite hostility between Abbas's Fatah faction and rival group Hamas which seized control of the coastal territory in fighting in June. Rice said Washington shared Israeli opposition to Hamas but expected humanitarian supplies to continue. She also said the internal Palestinian conflict should not jeopardise plans to found a single state in both the West Bank and Gaza. The Middle East conference forms a major part of Bush's strategy to promote stability in the region before he leaves office in a little over a year, ending a presidency dominated by the Iraq war and its bloody aftermath. He has encouraged Arab states to attend, but several have said they would do so only if they saw it producing agreement on fundamental issues for Palestinians. Also unclear is whether states regarded as hostile, notably Syria, should be invit
