<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 22 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain Saturday said his party would sit with allies to discuss the issue of dialogue with the Election Commission after a decision in a party forum. He told the reporters at his NAM flat in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar that he had informally been in contact with the allies in the four-party combine. Delwar however aired concern about the EC's way of work. "The activities of the EC are not clear. We are observing their activities. We will discuss the issue with the alliance once an environment of election is there." The secretary general claimed a rise in their popularity. "BNP is a strong political party. The situation created in the party helped the leaders and activists rather stand united than divided. The history of failure [of the leadership] is not a matter of concern for the leaders and activists." "I have the privilege to call the council of BNP. The secretary general will call the party council with permission from the chairperson." On the bitter political rival Awami League's move to start dialogue with the 14-party alliance, he said, "Awami League has already decided to sit with the EC. So they can have talks with the 14-party." "But you see our situation. Our [main] party office has been shut down. We cannot hold any formal meeting." Delwar earlier in the day spoke to leaders and workers of Chapainawabganj, Narayanganj and Demra. "BNP is united under the leadership of Khaleda Zia. Our main task is to get her and her family members released." Acting office secretary Rizvi Ahmed, former lawmaker retired Major Akhteruzzaman were present. bdnews24
