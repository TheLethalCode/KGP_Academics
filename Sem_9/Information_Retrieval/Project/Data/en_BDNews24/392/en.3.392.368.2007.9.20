<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Sep 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ask men to name their 10 most stylish peers of the past 50 years and it's unlikely handsome movie stars favored by women like Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise will show up. But Sean Connery? He gets major points because when it comes to style, men judge success, confidence, maturity and class more than good looks, according to GQ Magazine.
