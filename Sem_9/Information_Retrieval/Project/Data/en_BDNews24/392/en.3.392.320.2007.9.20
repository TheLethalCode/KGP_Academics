<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com) -- The Supreme Court Thursday granted permission for the government to move against a High Court bail order under emergency powers rules. The Appellate Division of the apex court presided over the issue of whether the High Court can consider bail appeals under the emergency powers rules. A full bench of the Appellate Division headed by chief justice Md Ruhul Amin ordered the government to file a "regular appeal" in three weeks against the HC verdict. The SC also extended a previous stay order on the HC verdict until the resolution of the regular appeal hearing. Justices Nazrul Islam Chowdhury and SM Emdadul Huq of the HC delivered a verdict on April 24 on a bail appeal, stating that the HC could consider bail applications under the emergency rules. But the April 24 verdict prompted a counter-appeal from the government in the Appellate Division in a bid to scuttle the plaintiff's bail. The legal issue came to a head when a man, named Maijuddin, filed an appeal for bail from the HC in a case that involves the supply of adulterated oil, which had been covered by the emergency powers rules. The emergency-time wrangle between the government and "graft suspects"mostly politiciansinvolved senior lawyers in court arguments. bdnew
