<TITLE> India inflation at lowest since 2002, oil a concern </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Fri Sep 21, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's inflation rate fell to its lowest level in nearly five years in early September, but analysts said further sharp falls were unlikely and record high oil prices could see prices ticking up before the year ends. The wholesale price index rose 3.32 percent in the 12 months to Sept. 8, down from 3.52 percent a week earlier and the lowest annual rise since Dec. 14, 2002, data showed on Friday. The rate was slightly higher the median forecast of 3.27 percent in a Reuters poll. Record oil prices -- they rose above $84 a barrel this week -- could lead the government to raise state-set retail prices of petrol and diesel, although increases could be delayed by opposition from political allies of the ruling coalition. "Oil is a risk for inflation going forward. Sooner or later, they have to pass on high global prices to consumers as they have held the prices at current levels for a long time," said DK Joshi, principal economist at rating agency Crisil. "My sense is that inflation will again inch closer to 4.5-5.0 percent by the end of December." Financial markets were little moved by the data, with the rupee holding close to a nine-year high of 39.85 per dollar and the 10-year bond yield steady at 7.83 percent. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) wants to contain inflation close to 5.0 percent in the fiscal year ending in March 2008. Governor Yaga Venugopal Reddy has said lower inflation should help economic growth, which he expected to be least 8.5 percent in 2007/
