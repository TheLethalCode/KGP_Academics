 WANA, Pakistan, Sept 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani militants released on Friday 25 of nearly 250 soldiers they have been holding captive for weeks after the army agreed to pull out of two posts in the northwest, an official and tribal elders said.

The official said security forces had abandoned two hill-top positions after militants demanded that the government abide by a peace agreement signed in 2005. Another tribal elder, Aisam-ud-din, said the militants would release the other soldiers if their demands were met. Attacks on security forces and abductions of soldiers have surged in Pakistan's volatile northwest since July when militants scrapped a nine-month-old peace deal in North Waziristan and army commandos stormed a radical mosque in the capital Islamabad. Suicide bombers have also struck near army headquarters in the city of Rawalpindi and at a commando base near Islamabad.
