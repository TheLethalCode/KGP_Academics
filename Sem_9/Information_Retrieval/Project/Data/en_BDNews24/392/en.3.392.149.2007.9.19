 NANTES, France, Sept 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Nicolas Sarkozy called for a `cultural revolution' to shake up France's archaic civil service on Wednesday, cutting numbers of employees but raising the pay of those kept on. He vowed to reduce the number of places at ENA, the exclusive training school for French state functionaries, and he said civil servants should be allowed to choose their job contracts and be better paid for overtime.
