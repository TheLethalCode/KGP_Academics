<TEXT>
 STUTTGART, Germany, Sept 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jamaica's Asafa Powell closed out his season with a sizzling run of 9.83 seconds to win the 100 metres at the World Athletics Final on Saturday. Powell, who lowered the world record to 9.74 earlier this month in Italy, clocked the third fastest time of the season to finish well clear of Jaysuma Saidy Ndure and take the $30,000 first prize on day one of the two-day competition. Croatian world champion Blanka Vlasic easily won the high jump, clearing 2.0 metres at the first attempt, but Russian world and Olympic champion Yelena Isinbayeva was in much less commanding form in a pole vault thriller. Isinbayeva needed a jump-off with Poland's Monika Pyrek to clinch victory and extend an unbeaten run that goes back to August, 2006. Pyrek cleared a personal best 4.82 metres to put the Russian under the sort of pressure she is not used to. Isinbayeva, who secured half of a million dollar Golden League jackpot last weekend, was able to match it but she sat out 4.87 and failed her three attempts at 4.92. To separate the two women, the bar went back down to 4.87. Isinbayeva cleared it on her first attempt and Pyrek failed, leaving the Russian the winner. The sprints were plagued by false starts, with four alone in the women's 200 metres, won by France's Muriel Hurtis-Houairi. TEST OF CONCENTRATION There were two more in the men's 100 metres before Powell surged to a championship record in a remarkable time given the slight headwind. Powell was beaten into third place in the 100m in the World Championships but he has been unstoppable ever since. "I'm just showing everybody that I can do it," Powell told reporters. "It's been a great season. Not the best -- I didn't get world title -- but I got the world record and I've been running some fabulous times since then." With Jeremy Wariner absent, LaShawn Merritt duly won the men's 400m in 44.58 ahead of Canada's Tyler Christopher, while world champion Michelle Perry just held off a challenge from Spain's Josephine Onyia to win the 100m hurdles. The men's 400m hurdles was even closer, with Poland's Marek Plawgo getting the decision on a photo finish with Kerron Clement of the U.S. Both men were timed at 48.35. While the crowd focused on the pole vault and high jump there were a couple of other notable performances in the field. Walter Davis leapt 17.35 on his final attempt to win the triple jump, a centimetre clear of fellow American Aarik Wilson. There was another American one-two in the shot put, with Reese Hoffa throwing 20.98 to edge out Adam Nelson. Czech Barbora Spotakova beat local favourites Steffi Nerius and Christina Obergfoell to win the women's javelin with 67.12, a national record. Russia's Tatyana Lebedeva brought a note of colour to the day, sporting hair dyed bright red as she won the long jump with her third leap of 6.78, well ahead of the American Grace Upshaw
