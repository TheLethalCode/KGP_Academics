 MADRID, Sept 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Argentina forward Lionel Messi steered Barcelona to a 2-1 home win over Sevilla in the Primera Liga on Saturday. The 20-year-old had been central to Barca's 3-0 win over Olympique Lyon in the Champions League on Wednesday and carried his team to victory again with two late goals in the Nou Camp. The first was a spectacular volley and the second a penalty, and only a fine save from Andres Palop denied him a hat-trick. Frederic Kanoute pulled a goal back for Sevilla at the very end but it was too late to stop Barca claiming all three points as they moved up to second place a point behind Real Madrid. On Sunday, leaders Madrid visit promoted Valladolid and Valencia travel to Real Betis.

Winger Albert Riera blasted the visitors in front from a freekick early on, but Recre took control at the start of the second half. Guerrero flicked the ball from one foot to the other before volleying past Carlos Kameni to level in the 54th minute, and burst through on to a defensive error to lift the ball over Kameni for the second six minutes later
