 Patuakhali, Sept 22 (bdnews24.com)  A storm in the choppy Bay of Bengal Friday sank a trawler with 14 fishermen on board in the deep sea, 30 kilometres off Kuakata. Nasir, sailor of the submerged trawler FB Jahangir, went into the sea with 14 fishermen on Thursday and the trawler sank Friday evening, Nimai Chandra, general secretary of Mohipur Fisheries Traders Association, said. The weather became worse Friday noon. Almost 200 trawlers managed to reach to the shore, but 12 trawlers with 150 fishermen on board were missing, he said. The met office said the seaports had been asked to show cautionary signal 3 and the storm fuelled by a depression had made the Bay wild on Patuakhali shore. The Patuakhali river port suspended launch service on the internal routes because of bad weather. Lower lands of Patuakhali were inundated with waves four to five feet higher than the water level. Gusty winds were flowing at a speed of 130 to 150 km in the sea, leaving hundreds of thousands of people in panic. bdnews2
