<TITLE> Cartoonist lands in jail, with no defence </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 19 (bdnews24.com)  Prothom Alo's freelance cartoonist Arifur Rahman was sent to jail Wednesday without any legal defence provided in court. The cartoonist is likely to face one-month's detention in jail initially, as there is a pending appeal by the prosecution. Arif was arrested on charges of offending religious sensibilities with a satirical cartoon strip. Metropolitan magistrate Abdul Fattah ordered him to Dhaka Central Jail, after sub inspector Ali Noor presented the case in court. However, no lawyer was seen defending Arif in court. According to the police report: "Arifur Rahman hurt religious sensibilities and insulted religious beliefs through his cartoon published on Sept 17, which has created religious tensions in the country." Arif's cartoon story titled "Naam" appeared on the sixth page of the 431st issue of Prothom Alo's satire magazine Aalpin that came out Monday, but was taken off the news stands after the home ministry ordered confiscation of all its copies Tuesday. Islamic organisations continued protests against the country's top-selling daily, for a second day Wednesday, staging a demonstration in front of Baitul Mukarram National Mosque and burning copies of the newspaper. Leaders of Hijbut Tahrir Bangladeshan offshoot of an Islamic party that appears on the US watch listalso made calls at a rally there for the arrest of Prothom Alo editor Matiur Rahman and publisher Mahfuz Anam. Activists of the Islamic outfit attempted a procession from the mosque area to surrounding streets, but faced resistance from the police. Any street protest or demonstration runs counter to the ongoing state of emergency in the country. Paltan police chief Md Fariduddin told bdnews24.com: "Any rally or procession is banned under the emergency powers rules. We are trying to stop them. But as it is a matter of religious sentiments, we are being tolerant." A number of Islamic leaders led by Baitul Mukarram Khatib Maulana Obaidul Haque met with law and information adviser Mainul Hosein Tuesday also demanding the arrest or surrender of the editor or others tied to the newspaper. After the meeting, Mainul alleged: "There is a conspiracy to destabilise the country. We are very concerned about the issue." The conspirators want to throw the country into chaos, he claimed. Meanwhile, Prothom Alo carried two front-page apologies on consecutive days for the cartoon story that the daily's joint editor said was published by mistake. Senior editors of the country, reviewing the mistake, stressed the need for a proper editorial system to be put in place to avoid a repeat of similar incidents in future. In a statement, Prothom Alo said the daily will no longer publish written pieces or cartoons by freelance cartoonist Arif and will be extremely cautious to prevent similar incidents in future. Prothom Alo's joint editor Abdul Qaiyum told bdnews24.com by phone: "Our position is very clear. It happened because of a lack of caution." "The cartoonist is not on the staff of Prothom Alo. He is a freelancer," Qaiyum said, couching his words carefully in an apparent attempt to disown the cartoonist. "We always review any contribution by freelancers. The cartoon was not selected for publication. Then again it got printed and it was a mistake." "We had a staff meeting and thought it over. The person in charge was sacked. We have apologised. We hope everyone will forgive us." To put their own house in order, Prothom Alo fired the person in charge. Arif was handed over to Tejgaon Police Station after he was arrested by Detective Branch police from his home Tuesday. bdnews24.com/lh
