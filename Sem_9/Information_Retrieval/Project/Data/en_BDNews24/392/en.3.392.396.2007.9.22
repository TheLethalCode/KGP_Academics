<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 22 (bdnews24.com)  Chief of the breakaway BNP faction of reformists Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan Saturday rubbished the talk of his going to Singapore with political agenda as "speculation". "Those who commented on my going to Singapore with an ulterior motive are not in their right mind," Bhuiyan told reporters at his Gulshan home on return from the city state in the morning. He said he had received medical attention for heart disease and arthritis in Mount Elizabeth Hospital and his condition was "fine". The expelled BNP secretary general said he had also seen the wife of senior Awami League leader Amir Hossain Amu there. Bhuiyan went to Singapore for treatment Sunday. On the comment of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's adviser ASM Hannan Shah on the Singapore trip, Bhuiyan said, "I went there for treatment, not to do politics. So I did not hold any meeting there." He said he had stayed at Copthorne Orchid Hotel in Singapore although some, Hannan Shah being one of them, said he had checked in at Park Hotel. "I hear that I had sought security from the Singapore police and filed a general diary for that. I will quit politics if anyone can show me a copy of the GD." To a question, he said, "We will decide about communicating with the alliance partners when we receive [the invitation letter] from the Election Commission." Bhuiyan said he had been unofficially in contact with the four-party alliance partners. bdnews24
