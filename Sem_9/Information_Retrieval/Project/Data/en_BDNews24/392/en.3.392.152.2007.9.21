 JERUSALEM, Sept 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israel stopped thousands of Palestinians from entering Jerusalem for Ramadan prayers at the al-Aqsa mosque on Friday and tightened border security as Jews prepared for the solemn annual rite of Yom Kippur. Israeli police and soldiers at checkpoints near the West Bank cities of Ramallah and Bethlehem turned away several thousand Palestinians who tried to enter Jerusalem for the second weekly prayers of the holy month of Ramadan.
