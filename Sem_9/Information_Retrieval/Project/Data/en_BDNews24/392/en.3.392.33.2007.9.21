Acting AL president Zillur Rahman told reporters after a meeting of its policymaking presidium at his Gulshan home in the morning that they fully endorsed the leftists' demands and condemned Jamaat-e-Islami's communal politics. The presidium decided to revitalise the 14-party alliance and tasked senior leader Tofail Ahmed to discuss the move with other members of the alliance.

He said they would offer special prayers in front of the Bangabandhu Bhaban to celebrate Hasina's birthday on October 28 and also for her release. Zillur called upon all AL leaders and workers across the country to arrange similar prayers on the day. On the electoral reform dialogues, the acting party chief said they would convene a working committee meeting after receiving the EC's invitation letter to decide the steps. Tofail said, "The 14-party entity is still intact and in one piece. We'll discuss the electoral reform issues among ourselves first so that we can make clear our stance before the EC in a coordinated manner." To a question, Mukul said, "I don't know the people who had kicked my car on September 12, but I certainly know those who instigated the matter. "I didn't disclose their names before the probe committee though. The reports published by different dailies on the incident did not seem right to me." bdnews24.
