 SYDNEY, Sept 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia captain Ricky Ponting will remain with the squad for their one-day tour of India despite suffering from a hamstring injury, Cricket Australia said. Ponting has been ruled out of the rest of the current Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa but will fly with the team to India next week for seven one-day internationals. "Ricky Ponting is making excellent progress following his hamstring strain in the game against Pakistan on Tuesday," Australia chairman of selectors Andrew Hilditch said in a statement. "Ricky will be coming on the tour of India and will resume playing as soon as he is medically cleared." Wicketkeeper Brad Haddin has been added to the touring party and will cover for Ponting until he recovers. All-rounder Shane Watson is being assessed after leaving the field during Thursday's Twenty20 game against Sri Lanka with hamstring soreness. The Australians, through to the Twenty20 semi-finals, are due to leave South Africa on Sept. 25 and the first one-day international against India is on Sept. 29 in Bangalore
