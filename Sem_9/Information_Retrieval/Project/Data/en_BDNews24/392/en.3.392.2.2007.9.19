<TEXT>
 LONDON, Sept 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Banks led European shares more than 2 percent higher by midday on Wednesday as investors celebrated a surprisingly large Fed rate cut that allayed fears of a global slowdown stemming from a credit crisis. At 1020 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 of top European shares was up 2.1 percent at 1,540.81 points, with commodity stocks also surging thanks to higher metal and oil prices. The Federal Reserve slashed its main funds rate by 50 basis points on Tuesday, the first cut in four years and twice as big as many investors had expected. The move powered US stocks to their biggest gain in four years. In Europe, the heaviest weighted gainers on the indexes were banking shares, which were recently battered on worries about their exposure to a crisis in the US subprime or risky mortgages market. Societe Generale rose 6.3 percent, UBS gained 4.4 percent and BNP Paribas added 4.1 percent. Among miners, Xstrata gained 5.9 percent, Anglo American rose 5.4 percent and BHP Billiton added 5.2 percent as copper futures prices rose nearly 2 percent. Utility, food and pharma stocks, traditionally seen as beneficiaries of a rate cut, also rose. "The Fed has made a bold policy move, which should now help restore confidence in financial markets worldwide. It should take out some of the volatility in the equity markets and steady them," Brewin Dolphin Chief Strategist Mike Lenhoff said in a note. "With less angst about default risk, the financials, banks and real estate sectors in particular, should make a start at recovering some of the ground they have lost," he said. Shares in British housebuilders rose sharply as well, with Persimmon up 5.7 percent and Barratt Developments gaining 5.4 percent. And a spike in the price of U.S. oil to a record high of $82.38 bolstered index heavyweight oil stocks BP, Royal Dutch Shell and Total by 1.6 to 1.8 percent. But Northern Rock, the British bank that sent depositors rushing to withdraw their savings and investors to sell their shares after funding constraints pushed it to approach the Bank of England for help last week, fell 8.5 percent. Traders said the new fall -- which came after a 55 percent slump over Friday and Monday -- was due to speculation of takeover bids south of 2 pounds per share for the bank. Northern Rock, and one of the rumoured bidders, Lloyds TSB, declined to comment, while another rumoured interested party, HBOS, was not available for immediate comment. Wednesday's share price rise pushed the gains for the FTSEurofirst 300 to 3.8 percent so far this year, underlining the rollercoaster progress of the benchmark this year. The index hit a 6-1/2 year high of 1,635.58 in mid-July, gaining from buoyant mergers and acquisitions, economic growth and strong company earnings. It then slumped 12.8 percent to its year low of 1,426.51 in mid-August on worries a crisis that originated in the US subprime mortgage market would poison the broader economy. The Federal Reserve cut its discount rate -- the rate it offers banks coming to it for help -- on Aug. 17, sparking a tentative rally that took a blow when Northern Rock was forced to go, cap in hand, to the Bank of England. Analysts say that which sectors gain from the cut will depend on whether it is seen as a one-off or the first of several to come. Many rate cuts could boost demand, bolstering cyclical stocks that depend on economic growth. "Risk appetite typically increases following Fed easing which will feed through to cyclical areas... Historically stocks with high free cash yield and strong growth characteristics outperform on Fed cuts," Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a note. Around Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 gained 2.1 percent, Germany's DAX rose 1.9 percent and France's CAC 40 rose 2.3 perce
