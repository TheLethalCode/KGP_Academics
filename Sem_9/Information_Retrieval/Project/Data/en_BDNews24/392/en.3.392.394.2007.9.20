 Dhaka, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com)  The Dhaka district magistrate has suspended the Prothom Alo's satire magazine Aalpin, three days after it ran a controversial cartoon strip "hurting religious sensibilities". In an order, the magistrate informed its publisher that the publication of the cartoon story violated the Printing Press and Publications (Declaration and Registration) Act 1973, the Press Information Department said in a statement Thursday. "The publisher has been asked to explain in two weeks from notification why the Prothom Alo's Aalpin magazine will not be banned," said the order, quoted by PID. The order asked the publisher to suspend the publication of Aalpin until the issue is resolved. The order described the satire magazine as unapproved.
