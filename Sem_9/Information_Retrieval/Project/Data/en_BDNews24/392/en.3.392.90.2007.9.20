 DURBAN, South Africa, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - All-rounder Jacques Kallis has been recalled to the South Africa squad for a test series in Pakistan in October. Kallis was left out for the Twenty20 World Cup and reacted to his omission by resigning as vice captain, saying he was considering his options. But selection convenor Joubert Strydom told a news conference in Durban on Thursday that the impasse had been resolved. "I know (Cricket South Africa chief executive) Gerald Majola has had various discussions with him," Strydom said. "Personally, there have never been problems and we're quite confident that he's ready to go." Batsman JP Duminy, who has played 15 one-day internationals and two Twenty20 internationals but no tests, has also won a place in the squad. "JP has a lot of talent and we want to send him to Pakistan to gain experience," Strydom said. "He will cover the number five, six or seven slot in the team." South Africa coach Mickey Arthur said Herschelle Gibbs would return to the top of the order in Pakistan. "Herschelle's test form hasn't been as good as he would like it to be, and I think opening the batting is his best position and that's where we'd like to see him this summer," Arthur told a news conference. South Africa will play five one-day internationals in Pakistan after the two test matches. Squad: Graeme Smith (captain), Hashim Amla, Mark Boucher, AB de Villiers, JP Duminy, Herschelle Gibbs, Paul Harris, Jacques Kallis, Morne Morkel, Andre Nel, Makhaya Ntini, Shaun Pollock, Ashwell Prince, Dale Steyn
