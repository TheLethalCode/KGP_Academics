 Chittagong, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com) -- A madrasa administrator Thursday filed a defamation case against the editor, publisher and freelance cartoonist of Bangla-language daily Prothom Alo with a Chittagong court. Patiya Al Jameya Al Islam Madrasa's administrative officer Mohammad Reza filed the case that cited "elements of sedition" in the publication of a controversial cartoon strip. Metropolitan magistrate Aminul Ahsan accepted the case and fixed Sept 30 for the next hearing. "The accused persons hurt the religious feelings of teachers, students, officials and employees of the plaintiff's institution as well as that of the devoted Muslims in Bangladesh and all over the world by publishing a satirical cartoon," the plaintiff said. Reza alleged that it has "instigated a sense of disloyalty and enmity to the government". The FIR said: "The accused made an ill-attempt to destroy discipline in the country and hamper development efforts of the government." "The accused conspired to destroy Bangladesh's friendly relations with the Muslim world by tarnishing the image of the country abroad which is a clear offence like sedition," Reza alleged. The plaintiff appealed for an arrest warrant against Prothom Alo editor Matiur Rahman, its publisher Mahfuz Anam and contributing cartoonist Arifur Rahman and stern punishment to them. He urged the court to take the allegations into cognisance. Lawyers Abul Khair and Nasiruddin conducted the case on behalf of the plaintiff. bdnews
