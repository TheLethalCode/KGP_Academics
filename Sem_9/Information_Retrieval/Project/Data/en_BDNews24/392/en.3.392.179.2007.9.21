<TITLE> Another apology, two cases and a notice on publisher </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com)  After two front-page apologies, a Baitul Mukarram meeting with clerics where editor Matiur Rahman again apologised, and two criminal cases filed in two different cities, the Prothom Alo publisher has received a note from the Dhaka district magistrate: explain why the satirical magazine should not cease to exist. The magistrate Thursday also suspended publication of Aalpin, three days after it ran a controversial cartoon strip "hurting religious sensibilities", until his notice was answered in two weeks. The order of suspension Thursday evening rounded off an eventful day for those involved in the cartoon's publication. Islamic clerics announced that they would not carry out any protest programme on Friday against Prothom Alo, as Matiur Rahman had apologised for the editorial oversight that had inadvertently caused offence. A top cleric, who leads prayers at the national mosque, appeared on the state-run BTV to make public what transpired in the meeting with the beleaguered editor. "He swore upon Allah (performed taoba ) and apologised. When someone does that, what else can you do other than forgive him?" Added Ubaidul Haque, the Khatib of the Baitul Mukarram mosque: "No one should make an issue out of it." The meeting with clerics was thought to be easing religious tensions that had been building over the previous two days over the cartoon's publication. Editors of several newspapers, emerging from a meeting with adviser Mainul Hosein, had earlier acknowledged that the publication of the cartoon was "unwanted and careless". Virtually no editor came out with any word of support for the troubled top-selling paper or its editor. Nor did anyone back the award-winning cartoonist Arifur Rahman, who spent his second day in jail. The editors urged religious leaders to be patient and tolerant. A defamation case was filed the same day against the editor, publisher and freelance cartoonist of the Bangla-language daily with a Chittagong court. Patiya Al Jameya Al Islam Madrasa's administrative officer Mohammad Reza filed the case that cited "elements of sedition" in the publication of the controversial cartoon strip. The Chittagong court accepted the case and fixed Sept 30 for the next hearing. Conspirators wanted to throw the country into chaos, Reza alleged. A second case was filed in Comilla by a member of the Bar. Identical charges were made. The magistrate ordered the police to take action. The complainants echoed law adviser Mainul Hosein, who after Wednesday's meeting with Islamic clerics on the matter, said: "There is a conspiracy to destablise the country. We are very concerned about the issue." Concern about the issue was spreading as the government also banned the Eid issue of Bangla-language weekly magazine Shaptahik 2000 Thursday. The Daily Star editor Mahfuz Anam is the publisher of both Prothom Alo and Shaptahik 2000. Home secretary Abdul Karim told bdnews24.com that the Eid edition of the magazine had also carried an article "offensive to religious sensibilities". Meanwhile, the suspension order on Aalpin stated specifically that the publication of the cartoon story violated the Printing Press and Publications (Declaration and Registration) Act 1973. The order asked the publisher to explain within two weeks from notification why Aalpin magazine should not be banned. The order, suspending publication until the issue is resolved, described the satire magazine as unapproved. Top-selling Bangla-language newspaper daily Prothom Alo carried the cartoon strip titled 'Naam" in its satire magazine Aalpin Monday. Tejgaon police chief Jane Alam Thursday filed a case against Arif, the cartoonist, with the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka. Police arrested Arif, who is now in jail, at his Uttara home on Sept 18. bdnews24.c
