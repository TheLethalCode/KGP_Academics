 Dhaka, Sep 23 (bdnews24.com)  Fazal M Kamal, a former editor of Holiday and Bangladesh Times, Sunday joined Bangladesh's first online newspaper bdnews24.com as Executive Director for News and Public Affairs. Kamal served as diplomat in New Delhi and London and was principal information officer to the government, a position that made him chief spokesman for the government. He was the chief executive of Adcomm.pr, the public relations and public affairs consultation wing of Adcomm, Bangladesh's biggest advertising firm, until he took up his new assignment with bdnews24.com. Kamal, who was the first Bangladesh correspondent for Time magazine, has worked in senior positions with an array of high-profile business, non-governmental and civil society organisations in a chequered career. "He brings with him a wealth of experience and diversity of knowledge truly unrivalled in Bangladesh journalism," said Editor-in-Chief of bdnews24.com Toufique Imrose Khalidi. "He will lead and supervise the newsroom operations and actually sit and work in the newsroom," Khalidi added. Widely travelled, Kamal has written columns on political, social and human-rights issues, short stories, movie and book reviews. bdnews24.com has come a long way since ownership and management changed hands about a year ago. Kamal is eager and has quite a few exciting ideas to diversify and widen the range of content of Bangladesh's first e-newspaper and internet-based news agency. bd
