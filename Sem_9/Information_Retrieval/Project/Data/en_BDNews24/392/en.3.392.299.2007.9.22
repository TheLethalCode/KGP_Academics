 Dhaka, Sept 21 (bdnews24.com)  The interim government is sweating over funding the budget for next year's South Asian Games to be held in Bangladesh. "We are thinking about the estimated budget of Tk 126 crore for the next year's SA Games as the government is now under huge financial pressure," sports adviser Tapan Chowdhury told reporters. He addressed participants for the Special Olympics in China at Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan Friday. A 68-member Bangladesh contingent will leave for Shanghai on Sept 27 and Grameenphone accorded a reception to the intellectually-challenged athletes ahead of the Special Olympics, scheduled for October 2-11. "I am not talking about deferring the SA Games, but the government has to think of other daily essentials like food, oil, fuel etc. "The government has to subsidise huge money for petroleum each day," Chowdhury later told the reporters while watching a cricket match of the intellectually-challenged. The sports adviser said that compared to the essentials, sports got less priority, but the government was trying its best to help flourish sports. The 11th SA Games involving eight countries is scheduled in December next year. The Bangladesh Olympic Association has already started preparation for the South Asian mega sports event by arranging training for the athletes. Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, the Maldives, Bhutan and Afghanistan are scheduled to take part in 17 disciplines. bd
