<TITLE> Global press freedom body calls for cartoonist's release </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 21 (bdnews24.com)  Reporters Without Borders, an Paris-based organisation that works for press freedom, has asked for release of the cartoonist detained for his controversial cartoon strip in Prothom Alo's satire magazine Aalpin. Religious groups and the government said the cartoon strip had "hurt religious sensibilities." "The play on words had no intention of attacking the Prophet," said Reporters Without Borders (RWB) in a statement issued on September 19. It was a joke about cultural customs, said RWB. "The government should not yield to pressure from extremist leaders who are trying to politicise the case." "Rahman should not be made a scapegoat. He must be freed," the statement urged. The drawing that created the storm showed a small boy adding the name Mohammed to the name of a cat. Cartoonist Arifur Rahman was arrested on Sept 18, a day after Prothom Alo's satirical magazine Aalpin ran the cartoon. Rahman was given no chance to explain his cartoon to the public or defend himself in court. bdnew
