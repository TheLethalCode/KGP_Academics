 BERLIN, Sept 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The economic gap between the old West Germany and the ex-communist East is closing, with eastern states enjoying faster growth, but high unemployment and migration remain a major concern, according to a report published on Wednesday. Although the economy is growing slightly faster in the east than in the west, long-term unemployment in the so-called "new states" was found to be still standing in the way of lasting improvement. "The new states find themselves on a stable growth path...we have a high growth rate and unemployment is falling," Transport Minister Wolfgang Tiefensee told a news conference on his ministry's annual report about the state of Germany since reunification in 1990. "Long-term unemployment is the central problem," he said. The economy in the west grew by 2.7 percent in 2006 and by 3 percent in the east. Tiefensee, who has responsibility for the "new states" in Chancellor Angela Merkel's government, told German media earlier on Wednesday that it would take 10 to 20 years for the economic gap between east and west to be bridged. Unemployment in the east fell by 15 percent in the past year, but long-term unemployment fell by only 8 percent. The jobless rate in the east is 17.3 percent, double that in the west. Hundreds of billions of euros have been pumped into poorer east German states under a "solidarity pact" since reunification, aimed at bridging the economic divide. The financing is set to continue until 2019, although some politicians have called for it to be phased out sooner. Tiefensee pointed out that the auto, chemical and energy sectors had helped fuel growth in the east but more needed to be done to keep people from moving to the west, such as better education and training programmes. The population of eastern Germany has shrunk by around 1 million since reunification. Tiefensee said economic development would also help the east grapple with some of its social problems. "It is also important to combat the breeding ground of anti-democratic, right-wing extremist and xenophobic tendencies," he said. A spate of high-profile crimes in eastern Germany, including racially motivated assaults, has alarmed politicians. Far-right parties are represented in the parliaments of three states in the former East Germa
