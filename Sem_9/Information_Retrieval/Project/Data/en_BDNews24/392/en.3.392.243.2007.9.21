 ISLAMABAD, sept 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - About 1,000 Pakistani opposition activists gathered outside the Supreme Court in Islamabad on Friday to denounce President Pervez Musharraf's bid to win another term in an Oct. 6 election. The activists from all main opposition parties chanted "Go Musharraf go" and carried a coffin symbolising what they hope will be the death of military rule. Army chief and important US ally Musharraf will seek re-election despite slumping popularity and legal challenges to his bid for power in the Supreme Court. Opposition parties have long been demanding Musharraf give up command of the army and run for office as a civilian, but some opponents want to see him blocked from power even if he gives up his military post. "Musharraf -- in uniform or out of uniform -- is unacceptable, it's unconstitutional. We'll wreck his election," Hafiz Hussain Ahmed, a leader of an alliance of Islamist parties, told the crowd. Musharraf will seek a new term through a vote by an electoral college of members of the two houses of parliament and four provincial assemblies. A general election is due by Jan. 15. An alliance of opposition parties that does not include the biggest, the Pakistan People's Party of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, later said all its members would resign from the national and provincial assemblies on Sept. 29. Bhutto, who has been in power-sharing talks with Musharraf, has said her members might also give up their seats if Musharraf did not take steps to restore democracy. An opposition boycott would not derail the vote but would detract from its legitimacy. No other prominent politician has declared an intention to stand in the presidential election. Musharraf, whose main source of power is his military post, has said he will retire from the army, but after winning another term. On Friday, he appointed a confidante to head the military's main intelligence agency in the first move of an expected reshuffle. The English-language Dawn newspaper said it was a great disappointment Musharraf had ignored calls to quit the army and seek a new term from new assemblies after a general election. There were small opposition protests in Peshawar and Karachi. The Supreme Court is hearing petitions challenging Musharraf's right to retain the posts of president and army chief, the legality of being elected in uniform, and whether he should be allowed to get a mandate from outgoing assemblies. The court is expected to issue a ruling next week. A decision to bar Musharraf from re-election would be "pregnant with possibilities and fraught with consequences", Dawn said. Officials have hinted that if barred from running for re-election, Musharraf could declare emergency rule. He could also dissolve parliament and seek election from new assemblies, though he has no guarantee of support in a new parliament. Turnover was low on Pakistan's main stock market as investors were reluctant to take fresh positions with politics clouding the outlook, dealers said. Compounding the uncertainty in the nuclear-armed country on the front line of global efforts to fight Islamist militants has been a surge in attacks and abductions of members of the security forces since July, when Musharraf ordered commandos to clear gunmen out of a radical Islamabad mosque. Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, in a Web audiotape issued on Thursday, vowed to retaliate against the "infidel" Musharraf for the operation against the Red Mosque. Al Qaeda has in the past called for Musharraf's assassination. Military spokesman Major-General Waheed Arshad dismissed the latest call as irrelevant, saying Pakistanis did not support bin Laden. Musharraf has survived at least two assassination bi
