<TITLE> Bhuiyan had no political agenda in Singapore: ZA Khan </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 21 (bdnews24.com)  A leader of breakaway BNP faction Friday dismissed allegations that their chief Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan had gone to Singapore with a political agenda, not for treatment. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's adviser ZA Khan told bdnews24.com: "The remark that the secretary general's Singapore visit had ulterior motives was sad, false and fabricated. Mannan Bhuiyan went to Singapore for treatment, not to do politics." Bhuiyan, the secretary general who Khaleda expelled before arrest on Sept 3, is expected to return home Saturday noon, Khan said. "I had talks with Mannan Bhuiyan at 1:45pm. He is returning home after recovery," he added. Another of Khaleda's advisers, Hannan Shah, had told reporters Friday that Bhuiyan's Singapore visit was "suspicious". Khan said Bhuiyan met Bangladeshis and exchanged greetings simply out of courtesy during his stay in Singapore. "Those who see politics here are misguided," said Khan. Bhuiyan flew to Singapore by a Thai Airways flight Sunday and received medical attention at the Mount Elizabeth Hospital for heart disease and other complaints. Bhuiyan had gone to Singapore in July last year for a heart surgery at the same hospital. bdnews24
