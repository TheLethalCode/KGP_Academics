 RIO DE JANEIRO, Sept 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazil coach Dunga has criticised the state of the pitch at the Maracana stadium where his side face Ecuador in a World Cup qualifier next month. "I understand a series of matches has contributed to this but the truth is the pitch is in bad condition, it needs to be repaired," he told reporters after visiting the ground on Thursday. "When I was a player the Maracana always had an excellent pitch." The playing surface was used a lot during the Panamerican Games in July, hosting the opening and closing ceremonies as well as the men's and women's soccer tournaments. Since then it has also been used by all four local clubs in the Brazilian championship. The match on Oct. 17 will be Brazil's first home international for two years and their first at the Maracana since 2000 when they beat Bolivia 5-0. Brazil kick off their 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign against Colombia in Bogota on Oct. 13 or 14
