 LONDON, Sept 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jose Mourinho has spoken of a "never ending love story" with Chelsea fans in his first public comments since parting company with the club in the early hours of Thursday morning. In a heartfelt letter on the team's Web site (www.chelseafc.com), the Portuguese coach said he was proud of his achievements since taking over in 2004. Mourinho's reign, which brought two Premier League titles, two League Cups and an FA Cup, ended because, in the club's words, their relationship had "broken down". "I am very proud of my work with Chelsea and I think my decision to come to England was an excellent one," said Mourinho, who never lost a home league game at Stamford Bridge. "It was a beautiful and rich period of my career. I want to thank all Chelsea supporters for what I believe is a never ending love story. "I wish great success to the club, a club that will be forever connected to me for some historic moments. I wish the players happiness in their football and in their family lives." In a separate statement, Chelsea said they had reached agreement on all contractual arrangements for Mourinho's departure although no details were disclosed
