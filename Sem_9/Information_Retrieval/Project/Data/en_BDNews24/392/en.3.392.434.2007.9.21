 KANDAHAR, Afghanistan, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Security has improved in the southern Afghan province of Kandahar in the past year, the provincial governor said on Thursday, but it will be a long time before Taliban insurgents are completely defeated in their former capital. Taliban rebels no longer mount large offensives and try to avoid head on clashes with the mostly Canadian NATO forces in the Kandahar region, but in the last year have instead turned to asymmetric warfare -- suicide attacks and roadside bombs. While the threat that Taliban rebels might retake Kandahar and other major towns in the south has subsided, the number of security incidents in the region has roughly doubled in the past year. "Kandahar was the capital of the Taliban and still the Taliban has a lot of interests here and also Kandahar is very close to Pakistan, this is why we had a lot of problems last year," Kandahar governor Asadullah Khalid told Reuters in an interview. "Thank God this year the situation is getting better, that does not mean we do not have any Taliban activity, but we are much better than last year." Aside from the large number of casualties inflicted on Taliban foot soldiers by NATO and U.S.-led forces and the increasingly confident Afghan army, foreign forces have also gone after Taliban leaders. In two special forces operations in Kandahar in the last week, one senior field commander was killed and four captured, a Western security analyst said. Governor Khalid enraged the Taliban by displaying the body of Mullah Dadullah, the top rebel commander for the south killed in May. The 37-year-old softly spoken governor has survived at least two suicide bomb attempts on his life in the past five months. The cells of seven suicide bombers were arrested in Kandahar this week, the security analyst said. They all had the same target -- the governor. Taliban recruitment in the south is down, the analyst said, and the insurgents have upped their rates of pay in response. "Still in some districts they have group activity but it is much less than last year and the situation is getting better day by day," Khalid said. But the end is far from being in sight, he said. "We have had 30 years of war and we had a lot of ammunition and guns and terrorists from all over the world," Khalid said. "A lot of terrorists are still in Afghanistan they are getting support from our neighbouring countries." Pakistan acknowledges the Taliban have been able to use many of its border areas as a safe haven direct the insurgency and train fighters, but says it is doing its best to combat militants that operate on both sides of the border. "Our enemy, most of them are living in neighbouring countries, they have families there, their wounded go to neighbouring countries' hospitals the are getting economic support," Khalid said. "The war against terrorism will not be won in one year," he said. "The Afghan people need peace and they are thirsty for peace more than anyone in the world -- we suffered for 30 years from fighting and from wa
