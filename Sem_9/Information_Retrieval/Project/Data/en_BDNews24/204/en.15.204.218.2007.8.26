That's how I like to think about it." The former world number one also lost to Henin in the last eight of the French Open and the pair could meet again in the quarter-finals here. "It doesn't bother me," said Williams, the U.S. Open champion of 1999 and 2002. "I'm excited. She's one of my favourite opponents because she has a good game and she enjoys the battle."
