<TITLE> Colombian warlord breaks deal, faces extradition </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BOGOTA, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Colombia's government offered to extradite a jailed paramilitary chief to the United States on Friday after kicking him out of a peace accord for organizing drug trafficking from his prison cell. Carlos Mario Jimenez was the first militia warlord to lose benefits offered by President Alvaro Uribe in exchange for giving up crime and surrendering arms after years of atrocities committed in the name of fighting left-wing guerrillas. The announcement came as Uribe, an ally to Washington, fends off a scandal tying some of his lawmaker allies to the paramilitaries and U.S. Democrats debating a new aid package for Colombia question whether he has done enough to curb militia influences. "Those who continue to commit crimes will face the same fate," Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos told local radio. "Those who are fulfilling their commitment and are not involved in crime have nothing to fear." Authorities transferred Jimenez to Combita jail, from where extraditions are often carried out. Another warlord, Diego "Don Berna" Fernando Murillo, was taken there for security during a probe of possible violations of his peace deal. Organized in the 1980s, the paramilitaries are accused of some of the worst massacres in Colombia's conflict as they pushed back guerrillas, snatched land and killed in the name of counter-insurgency, often in collusion with state forces. Under the peace deal, the paramilitary commanders gave up the gun in exchange for short jail terms, provided they were not involved in crime, gave full confessions and paid reparation to victims. Colombia also suspended U.S. extradition warrants on drug trafficking charges for some. Jimenez -- alias "Macaco" -- led the Central Bolivar Bloc, one of the most powerful paramilitary organizations. He will now face ordinary justice and could be extradited to the United States at Washington's request, Interior Minister Carlos Holguin said. Rights groups say the commanders have been allowed to keep their criminal structures intact and that too little pressure has been put on the warlords to hold up their end of the peace deal to bring justice to thousands of their victims. Violence from the country's four-decade-old war has eased with the paramilitary disarmament and the government has sent troops to push back guerrillas from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia or FARC, which is still fighting Latin America's oldest insurgency.
