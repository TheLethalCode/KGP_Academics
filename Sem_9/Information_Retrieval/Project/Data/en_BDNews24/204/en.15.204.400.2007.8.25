<TITLE> Normalcy back on streets as curfew eases </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com)  Streets and markets were bustling Saturday as the government suspended the curfew for 17 hours to 11 pm. Traffic and usual chaos returned to the streets but there was no sign of protest that swept the city of 10 million people a few days ago, prompting the government to enforce the curfew. Five other biggest cities also experienced a normal day Saturday. The curfew had resumed at 10pm Friday after a 14-hour break and mobile phone networks went back up after they were switched off sometime late afternoon. The government in a new order Friday night said the restrictions on movement would have a 17-hour pause from 6am for Saturday. The cellphone networks went dead around 4pm to 9pm Thursday and again from around midnight to 3am. On Wednesday, the first day of curfew, they stopped from 6pm as curfew approached. The operators had initially said they were asked to put it off until 8:30pm but the system didn't return to life until around 7am the following morning. Markets and streets had bustled earlier Friday as residents took advantage of a curfew suspension to stock up on food and other necessities. There have been no signs of protests since the curfew was imposed Wednesday evening, but security forces appeared to be taking no chances, arresting five teachers and one student leader since late Thursday. In capital Dhaka, residents ventured out of their homes and visited their relatives Saturday while day labourers hit the streets to make up for their losses. The city's vegetable markets saw a huge influx of shoppers since Saturday morning. Amid a tight curfew, the residents were forced to stay home since Wednesday night except for a three-hour respite Thursday afternoon. Despite a regular weekend day, cars and buses had hit the Dhaka streets immediately after the state-run Bangladesh Television in a morning news bulletin Friday broke the news that the curfew had been eased between 8am and 10pm Friday. Security forces detained two Dhaka University professors overnight Friday, including Anwar Hossain, general secretary of Dhaka University Teachers' Association. The other was professor Harun-ur Rashid, dean of the Social Sciences Faculty. Former vice-chancellor of Rajshahi University Prof Saidur Rahman Khan, convenor of RU Progressive Teachers Community Prof Abdus Sobhan and management department associate professor Moloy Kumar Bhowmik were also arrested. Security forces detained president of Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal Azizul Bari Helal were arrested early in the day. Cases were filed against 2,500 unnamed people, mostly students, in Rajshahi for Wednesday's violence. There was no official version about the arrest. The families of the arrestees said they had no clue about the whereabouts of the detainees. AFM Yusuf Haider, the acting vice chancellor of the Dhaka University, told reporters that they were anxious about the detained teachers. "We're trying to know about their whereabouts," Haider said. "We're maintaining contact with their families." The government imposed the curfew at 8pm Wednesday to tame a wave of violence that swept many parts of the country since Monday evening. The violence erupted at the Dhaka University Monday, spreading to college campuses across the country and then onto city streets and highways. A string of clashes between the students and the security officials left one man dead and at least 300 people injured. As the violent protests spilled out of the campuses onto the Dhaka streets Wednesday, many common people, specially hawkers hit hard by the government's eviction drive from the streets, also joined in. The people, who live by the day, are the worst victims of the curfew though it has brought a sense of calmness among many citizens. There was no report of protest or violence Friday. It was a different day in the city's main Baitul Mokarram Mosque as devotees poured into it to say their weekly prayers amid tight security. The security officials frisked devotees, an effort the officials said a part of their regular security precautions. Other mosques in the capital also experienced a huge rush of devotees, witnesses said. But the Dhaka University, the centre of the recent contention, remained almost empty. Only the security officials roamed the green campus where violence raged on only a few days ago. Thursday's three-hour curfew break did not seem sufficient for those who had to catch a bus or a train or a motor-launch to leave Dhaka. The kitchen market had many buyers, but the stocks of commodities seemed to be running low too soon. Stuffs were pricey too. Retailers said prices soared further because of the curfew and also because the consumers were hurriedly buying up whatever they stumbled into, without really caring for quality or prices. Many attending to ailing relations and friends were in real trouble during the curfew, especially those who tried to evacuate serious patients. A number of day labourers, hawkers, tea vendors and rickshaw pullers were upset since they were being forced to stay indoors without no income, no savings. bdnews24.com/mhs/w
