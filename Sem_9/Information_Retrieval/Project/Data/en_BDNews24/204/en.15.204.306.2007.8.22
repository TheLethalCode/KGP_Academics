 Dhaka, Aug 22 (bdnews24.com) Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed has blamed "evil forces" for the spread of countrywide violence since Monday. In an address to the nation Wednesday night, Fakhruddin said the government was forced to impose a curfew to stop the ongoing illegal activities and to save the lives and property of people. "It [curfew] is a temporary step and will be withdrawn after an improvement in the situation," the chief adviser said. He also said: "It has been observed that non-students are taking part in these rowdy and anarchic acts. This cannot be allowed to continue." Fakhruddin said he hopes people of all walks would come together to restore law and order, adding that the government had shown enough tolerance in tackling the situation. Giving details of what his government had done to ease the situation, he said the army camp at Dhaka University playground was withdrawn Tuesday night, and a judicial inquiry committee headed by a retired High Court judge has been formed to investigate the incident on the campus that led to the protests. The chief adviser said action would be taken against those responsible on the basis of the army inquiry report. "Despite these measures, a section of people is engaged in damaging public and private property in Dhaka and other places of the country," he said. bdn
