 Dhaka, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com) -- The government has formed a one-member judicial commission with former Supreme Court judge Habibur Rahman Khan to probe the Aug 20 violence at Dhaka University. The commission has been requested to submit its report within 15 workdays, the home ministry said in a statement Saturday. The statement referred to the clashes between police and students, which occurred on the night of Aug 20 over an "untoward incident" on the Dhaka University campus. "Taking advantage of the incidents, some opportunists resorted to creating indiscipline," the ministry said. The government clamped a curfew on six divisional cities including Dhaka from 8pm of Aug 22 to protect life and property and maintain law and order. "Some people had already been arrested in connection with the incidents of August 20 and after. Action was being taken against the arrested persons in line with the law," the statement said. "However, if allegations against any person were not proved, he would surely be released." Cases were filed with some police stations in Dhaka against "unidentified persons" for creating indiscipline, the ministry said, adding the government wanted to categorically state that none would be arrested or harassed without specific allegations and evidence. "The government was always alert about maintaining an academic environment on the university campus. The government was firm about giving all assistance to the university teachers and students in this regard," it said. bd
