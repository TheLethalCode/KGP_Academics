 LONDON, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Annual house price inflation in England and Wales eased for a fourth consecutive month in August, a survey showed on Friday, providing further evidence that the housing market is coming off the boil. Property consultant Hometrack said house prices rose an annual 5.4 percent in August, down from 5.9 percent in July. Prices were unchanged on the month, the lowest rate of monthly growth since November 2005. The monthly figures are not adjusted to take seasonal factors into account. "Buyer confidence has been weakening on the back of increased affordability pressures over recent months but the turmoil in global equity markets has added a new external dimension," said Richard Donnell, director of research at Hometrack. "The housing market faces a testing time over the rest of the year." Hometrack figures show London was the only region to register growth in house prices over the month, although the 0.1 percent rise was well below the recent March high of 1.8 percent. Three regions -- Yorshire and Humberside, the North and South West -- recorded price falls of 0.1 percent over the month.
