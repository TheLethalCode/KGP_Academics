<TEXT>
 MUMBAI, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Indian board is planning its own Twenty20 professional league to counter a high-profile, unauthorised Twenty20 league planned for later this year. "All I can say for now is it is at an early stage," board secretary Niranjan Shah told Reuters on Friday. "The idea was actually floated last year. The modalities will be discussed at a meeting next month and we could have foreign players participating," he added. The Board of Control for Cricket in India's decision is seen as a counter to the lucrative Indian Cricket League, promoted by India's Essel Group which controls the country's biggest listed media firm Zee Telefilms. The ICL is due to kick-off in October and has signed up about 50 Indian domestic cricketers and several foreign players despite the boards of India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka announcing bans on those who associate with them. Former Pakistan skipper Inzamam-ul Haq, experienced batsman Mohammad Yousuf, all rounder Abdul Razzaq and Imran Farhat have joined up. Retired West Indies skipper Brian Lara was the first big name to agree to join. The Indian board sacked former skipper Kapil Dev as national academy chief on Tuesday after he refused to give up his post as chairman of the ICL's executive board. India media on Friday speculated that the board's "Premier Cricket League" would be set up in a manner where corporates can buy a team franchise and players can be bought, sold or transferred like in professional club soccer
