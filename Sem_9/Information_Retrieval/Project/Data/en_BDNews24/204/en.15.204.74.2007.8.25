<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com) -- Professor AFM Yusuf Haider, acting vice chancellor of Dhaka University, Saturday urged the authorities to take utmost caution in legal proceedings against colleagues Prof Anwar Hossain and Prof Harun-or-Rashid. "As the guardian of the university, I expect that the proper legal proceedings be followed for the respected teachers. There should not be any difficulty getting justice," he told reporters. He said he had contacted the authorities about the matter as he was in "extreme anxiety" after the detention of his colleagues. Some teachers, including Prof Sadrul Amin, president of Dhaka University Teachers' Association, went to meet the acting VC and discussed the release of their colleagues. Before the two teachers were remanded by a Dhaka court, Sadrul Amin, professor of English, told bdnews24.com: "I don't know what the charges against the two teachers are. It's not fair to arrest a person without any charge." The joint forces went to Sadrul Amin's house Thursday night, but he was not home at the time. The former DUTA general secretary, Prof Afsaruzzaman, told bdnews24.com: "The teachers expressed solidarity with the students on moral grounds. It's not true that the solidarity was to oust or embarrass the government." He asked the government to create a flexible environment by releasing the teachers. The university proctor committee meeting presided over by acting VC Yusuf Haider was held Saturday morning. The meeting decided that the hall offices would remain closed until further notice. Members of the joint forces arrested Anwar Hossain and Harun-or-Rashid in their Tower Bhaban apartments on the campus late Thursday night. Families of the detained professors have demanded their release. Fellow professors and relatives visited the families of the two teachers Saturday morning. bdnews24
