 Dhaka, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com)Law and information adviser Mainul Hosein Sunday urged people, including journalists, to work together to overcome the crisis that the country is facing. Speaking to reporters in a press briefing Sunday, after a meeting with newspaper editors, he said the country would be in great danger if "we did not all work together". However, none of the editors present at the meeting answered questions at the briefing on the issues that had been discussed behind closed doors. Mainul told the reporters that discussions had hinged on the overall situation of the country including the recent unrest at Dhaka University. The government, said the adviser, is relying on the media. "There is no doubt that the country is going through a crisis. We have a lot of problems to confront. So we might make mistakes. We have to go towards our goals by correcting those mistakes," he said. On the issue of journalists being harassed during the curfew, Mainul admitted, "The joint forces harassed a number of newsmen during the curfew." "The government has expressed its regret. I have been assured by the authorities that such incidents do not occur in future. I have assured the editors of this also." The adviser has acknowledged that some recent incidents created misunderstandings, but that "everyone should keep in mind that such incidents can happen in a crisis". "We have to go forward by solving these misunderstandings," he said. "We are working for a corruption-free state and politics. The government has to be successful in its endeavour for reforms." Mainul also said some people had tried to create chaos in the wake of the violent incidents at Dhaka University. "The government has had to confront the situation and has already done so to some extent." "The media and the government have to work closely, no matter how critical the situation turns, so that we can take our country forward," he added. However, the adviser left the briefing as reporters began questioning him further. bdnews24.com/
