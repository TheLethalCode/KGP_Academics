<TEXT>
 KAMPALA, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Democratic Republic of Congo's foreign minister was in Uganda on Saturday to discuss with President Yoweri Museveni a border dispute in which a British oil worker was killed this month. Ugandan Foreign Minister Sam Kutesa flew to Kinshasa last week to start talks to resolve the tensions over Lake Albert, where Heritage Oil Corp and Tullow Oil are prospecting. Kinshasa says they are working illegally in its waters. "Foreign Minister Mbusa Nyamwisi is here to follow up Mr Kutesa's visit to Kinshasa. If all goes well it will turn into direct talks between Presidents Musveni and (Joseph) Kabila," deputy Ugandan foreign minister Oryem Okello told Reuters. The gun battle on Aug. 3 pitched Ugandan troops allied with guards working for Heritage Oil against Congolese soldiers. The Congolese shot dead a Heritage contractor. Relations between the two countries have been fraught for years. Kampala twice invaded Congo, it says to flush out Ugandan rebels. The second time sparked a 1998-2003 war that drew in five other countries. Uganda regularly threatens to reinvade.
