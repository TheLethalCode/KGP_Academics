 VIENNA, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A planned multibillion dollar US military aid package aimed to bolster Middle East allies will do nothing to improve their security or stability, the UN nuclear watchdog chief said in remarks published on Monday. Washington announced on July 30 it would funnel military aid worth more than $43 billion to Egypt, Israel, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states over 10 years to help protect them against Iran and fears of spillover from militant chaos in Iraq. Mohamed ElBaradei, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency which has been probing suspicions of an illicit nuclear bomb programme in Iran, was quoted by Austrian weekly magazine Profil as saying Washington's military aid was misguided. "Pouring more money into arms is not going to resolve the issue. You can end up in a situation like the Cold War in the past," ElBaradei, who has disagreed with U.S. efforts to isolate Iran, told the magazine. "Does that provide security? Does that provide stability? It doesn't. It's a very dangerous development," he was quoted as saying. ElBaradei said such money would be better spent on economic development in the region, "projects that would improve the human rights situation, fight poverty and improve the weak education system. Security can only be assured through development of the region." Around $30 billion of the aid would go to Israel, Washington's closest Middle East ally. Iran accused the United States of seeking to create fear and sow divisions in the Middle East by announcing the arms deals. ElBaradei was also quoted as saying Washington's mooted intent to put the Revolutionary Guards, part of Iran's military, on its list of terrorist organisations was unhelpful. "There is a decisive choice. If you decide on confrontation in order to achieve regime change, then you can forget about talks and must not be surprised if the other side seeks revenge," he was quoted as saying. "The other possibility is to say, 'Even if we don't like this regime, we still have to talk with its representatives.' So it's either dialogue or isolation. In these situations I've always been for dialogue to find lasting solutions." ElBaradei said time would tell whether Iran would honour an accord with the IAEA last week to resolve long-standing agency questions about the nature of its nuclear programme to defuse mistrust which led to UN sanctions against Tehran. But he reiterated his view that a "comprehensive security dialogue" between Iran and its neighbours, also involving Israel and the United States, was needed to rein in Iran's nuclear ambitions. "Such a security dialogue is being conducted with North Korea now. That is exactly what is missing in the Middle Eas
