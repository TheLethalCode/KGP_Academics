 HYDERABAD, India, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)---Two explosions within minutes killed at least 34 people in Hyderabad on Saturday, police said. "At least 34 people have been killed in the two blasts within a gap of 10 minutes," a senior police officer told Reuters. One blast was at the Lumbini amusement park where a laser show was taking place, and the officer said it could have been caused by an "improvised explosive device". Seven people were killed immediately in the park explosion, and two died later in hospital. The same police officer said another explosion at a street-side eatery was caused by a exploding gas cylinder and killed 11 people. A total of 50 people were wounded in the two explosions. The NDTV news channel showed what appeared to be at least two dead bodies slumped under rows of blue plastic seating in the park, both with blood-soaked clothing. In May, 11 people were killed in a bomb blast in a historic mosque in Hyderabad -- a communally sensitive city -- and five died when police fired on protesters later.
