<TEXT>
 BAGHDAD, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki demanded an apology from the French government on Sunday after its foreign minister was quoted as saying Maliki should be replaced. In an interview with Newsweek magazine's Sept. 3 edition, published on its Web site, French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner was quoted as saying Maliki should be replaced, possibly by Shia Vice President Adel Abdul-Mahdi. "The French foreign minister called for the collapse of this government and to form a new one. We cannot classify such a thing as diplomatic," Maliki told a news conference. "We call on the government of France, and not the minister, to deliver an apology. They must respect their relations and diplomatic courtesy," he added. At a rare joint news conference with fellow political leaders including Abdul-Mahdi, Maliki announced on Sunday the country's main political groups had agreed on steps to heal their divisions. Newsweek said its interview with Kouchner was conducted in French soon after he returned to Paris last week from a visit to Iraq. A video clip of Kouchner on its Web site was dated Aug. 24. "Many people believe the prime minister ought to be changed. I don't know if that will go through, though, because it seems President Bush is attached to Mr Maliki. But the government is not functioning," Kouchner was quoted as saying. He said he had told US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice "listen, he's got to be replaced". He added that he planned to meet Rice in a few days. "There's a lot of support for, for instance, Adel Abdul-Mahdi who's an impressive fellow, and not only because he studied in France. He's solid. Of the people who are available, he's widely seen as the one that ought to have the job," Kouchner said. In the interview, Kouchner ruled out sending French troops to Iraq but said he was not asking for US troops to leave now. "In fact, no one is asking that they leave immediately. No one said that to me (when I was in Iraq). Those who talk about the American occupation, if you say to them, 'Do you want them to leave right now', they tell you, 'Oh, I didn't say that'. They don't want it," Kouchner said
