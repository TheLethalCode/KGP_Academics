 OSAKA, Japan, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New 100 metres world champion Tyson Gay and world record holder Asafa Powell are likely to meet again as early as next month in Brussels, Powell's manager said on Monday. "Asafa is definitely running Brussels (on Sept. 14) and that's where they will likely meet up for the first time," Doyle told Reuters in a telephone interview. American Gay streaked past Powell to claim the world title in 9.85 seconds on Sunday in their first meeting of the year. Powell had won all five of their previous meetings over the distance. The Jamaican faded to third in 9.96 seconds with Bahamian Derrick Atkins taking silver in 9.91. Gay quickly said he was ready for a rematch. "I want to race everyone in the world," the U.S. sprinter said after winning his first global title. "I believe we've got a great rivalry coming along." Doyle said Powell had similar thoughts. "As soon as he crossed the finish line, he was thinking about that (a rematch)," Doyle said. The loss was a major setback for Powell, who has never won a global title despite having clocked a world record 9.77 seconds three times. "I just tightened up and panicked," Powell said. In addition to the Brussels meeting, Powell is considering running in Rieti, Italy on Sept. 9, Doyle said. The Jamaican also has competitions scheduled for Warsaw, Poland on Sept. 19, Shanghai on Sept. 28 and Yokohama, Japan on Sept. 30, Doyle said
