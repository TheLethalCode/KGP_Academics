 NEW DELHI (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former cabinet minister Shibu Soren, sentenced to life in prison, was acquitted by a court on Wednesday for his role in a conspiracy to kidnap and murder his former private secretary 13 years ago. Soren was coal minister in Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's cabinet but quit in December after a Delhi city court convicted him along with four others, making him the first Indian minister to be held guilty in a murder case. Following an appeal by Soren to the Delhi High Court, the two-judge bench said the prosecution had not provided enough evidence to prove Soren's involvement in the death of his secretary Shashi Nath Jha. "The prosecution has miserably failed to bring home the charge," said R.S. Sodhi, one of the two judges. Soren, 62, is a tribal leader and represents the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, a regional party and ally of the ruling Congress Party. Prosecution lawyers said they would appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision. Jha had gone missing in May 1994 and his body was later found in Ranchi, capital of Jharkhand, Soren's home state. The prosecution had made out a case that Jha had knowledge of bribes allegedly paid by then Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao to Soren and other members of his party to win a parliament confidence vote and was blackmailing Soren. It was not immediately clear if Soren would resume his post in the cabinet.
