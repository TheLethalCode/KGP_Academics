 HONG KONG, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asia Pacific stocks rose on Monday, taking their cue from a Wall Street rally triggered by surprisingly strong economic data, while government bonds fell and the yen weakened versus the dollar as risk appetite strengthened. Exporters and US-linked firms helped lead the rally in Asian equities after the solid US housing and durable goods numbers on Friday. The reports helped quell fears about the impact of the worst credit market turmoil of the decade on the outlook for global growth. "The stronger-than-expected US economic data and easing fears from the US subprime mortgage sector are mainly behind today's gains," said Kim Jeong-hwan, a strategist at Woori Investment and Securities. "We are still in the midst of a technical rebound. From a fundamentals perspective, the market is likely to remain cautious. The key factor this week will be US economic data and whether US stocks extend a recent rebound," he added. MSCI's measure of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan, rose 2.2 percent at 0244 GMT. The index rose almost 11 percent last week in biggest weekly gain on record, according to Reuters data going back to Dec. 31, 1987. The index has rebounded 16 percent since hitting a five-month trough on Aug. 17, and is now less than 8 percent below its July 24 record high. US stocks jumped on Friday as the surprisingly strong data relieved anxiety about the economy and bolstered investor confidence after weeks of market turbulence. ASIAN GAINS That confidence spilled over into Asia Pacific markets with Australian and South Korean shares rising nearly 2 percent. Hong Kong-listed shares in mainland companies, or H shares, hit a record high, rising 3.7 percent on expectations that mainland investors will pile into stocks that are trading at discounts to their mainland-listed counterparts following changes to investment rules last week. Shanghai stocks hit a record high for a fifth session running. Japan's Nikkei average ended the morning session up just over 1 percent, with high-tech exporters such as Sony Corp gaining ground. Japanese exporters were helped by the softer yen. The yen was pressured as recovering stock markets whetted investor appetite for riskier bets, including those that use the low-yielding Japanese currency to buy assets in higher-yielding ones. The yen had rallied earlier this month as the turmoil in global credit markets slashing demand for riskier investments and prompted investors to bail out of yen carry trades. "US stocks recovered last week, so some investors are finding it easier to take on risk," said Hiroshi Yoshida, forex trader at Shinkin Central Bank. "It's becoming harder to buy the yen," he said, adding that risk demand would continue to heat up, albeit with caution that signs of more subprime problems may once more rattle sentiment. Market participants in Tokyo were also waiting for embattled Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to announce a new cabinet on Monday to shore up faltering support a month after his ruling coalition suffered a massive election defeat. The dollar climbed as high as 116.76 yen, pulling further away from a 14-month low of 111.60 yen just over a week ago. At 0230 GMT, it was little changed at 116.35 yen. The euro was also nearly flat at 159.15 yen after an early rally to 159.68 yen, its highest in nearly two weeks. Both the dollar and the euro pared early gains against the yen due to technical selling. Improving confidence of market stability kept the dollar under selling pressure against the euro, as well as high-yielding currencies like the Australian and New Zealand dollars. The Australian dollar rose 0.3 percent to $0.8295. The New Zealand dollar jumped 0.75 percent to $0.7265. The Aussie and the kiwi boast the highest rates among industrialised countries. Japanese government bond futures fell, with the 10-year future down as much as 0.25 point at 135.28, back from an 18-month peak of 136.46 last week. In energy markets, oil prices fell on Monday, retreating from the last session's near 2 percent gain which was boosted by worries over gasoline supplies in top energy consumer the United States. US crude for October delivery fell 20 cents to $70.89 a barrel by 0108 GMT. It settled $1.26 higher at $71.09 a barrel on Friday following news of troubles at various refineries. London Brent was down 22 cents at $70.40 a barrel
