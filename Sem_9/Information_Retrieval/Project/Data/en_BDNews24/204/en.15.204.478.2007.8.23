 MUMBAI, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former India players criticised the Indian board on Thursday for banning players who have joined an unapproved Twenty20 league planned for later this year. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) sacked former skipper Kapil Dev as national cricket academy chief on Tuesday after refusing to give up his post as chairman of the Indian Cricket League's executive board. They also banned former and current players who have signed up after the board refused permission for the league, which is due to kick-off in October. "The board has been harsh on the ICL," former captain Ajit Wadekar told Reuters by telephone. "They should've had a discussion with them. "The ICL's intention seems to be to give a boost to domestic cricket and provide a platform for players who do not get a chance to play for India." Former Pakistan skipper Inzamam-ul Haq, experienced batsman Mohammad Yousuf, all rounder Abdul Razzaq and Imran Farhat have joined up despite the Pakistan board, like India and Sri Lanka, announcing bans on those who signed up with ICL. Retired West Indies skipper Brian Lara was the first big name to sign up. About 50 domestic players including former India cricketers Dinesh Mongia and Deep Dasgupta have also joined the lucrative league promoted by India's Essel Group, which owns the nation's largest listed media firm, Zee Telefilms Ltd. Former captain Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi was also critical. "I don't think you can ban players as long as they fulfil their commitments to the board," he told Reuters. "If there is a clash of commitments, then of course it is a different matter entirely." The board has also withdrawn benefits such as pensions to former players who have joined the ICL. "They earned that for services rendered earlier, that's unfair," said Wadekar, who led India to their first series victories in West Indies and England in 1971. The International Cricket Council (ICC) said it had no role to play in the matter. "The ICC's stand hasn't changed from the earlier time (when) we said it is a BCCI issue," ICC spokesman Brian Murgatroyd said
