<TEXT>
 LONDON, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chelsea went top of the Premier League when they beat Portsmouth 1-0 at Stamford Bridge on Saturday and leaders Manchester City lost 1-0 at Arsenal. Frank Lampard's 31st minute strike was enough to extend Chelsea's record unbeaten home league run to 65 matches and move them on to 10 points from four matches. It was Portsmouth's first defeat of the season. It was the fourth successive match in which Lampard had scored, including England's goal against Germany on Wednesday, and manager Jose Mourinho praised his performance. "When he plays well he is the best, when he doesn't play well he is the second best, he is a fantastic player," Mourinho told BBC TV. "But I want my team to play better," he added. "The weather didn't help, it was very, very hot and it cost us a bit. It was not a great performance -- but a good result." Manchester City goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel saved a 66th minute penalty from Robin van Persie but had no chance of stopping a shot from Cesc Fabregas 14 minutes later which was enough to secure the points for the Gunners and end City's perfect start to the season. They have nine points from four games, but Schmeichel, taking a leaf out of his father Peter's book, nearly saved a point for City just before the end. Like his father used to do for Manchester United, Schmeichel joined the City attack for a corner and forced Arsenal goalkeeper Manuel Almunia into saving his header. CONCEDED GOAL City manager Sven-Goran Eriksson, told Sky Sports News after his side conceded their first goal of the season: "Now and then we played really well but now its time to see the reaction to our first defeat of the season. "I can't complain about the performance. We stood up to Arsenal and I am rather proud of the way the players played." Arsenal moved on to seven points, along with Wigan Athletic, who drew 1-1 at West Ham United, Liverpool, who beat Sunderland 2-0 in a lunchtime kickoff and Everton, who drew 1-1 at home with Blackburn Rovers. Mohamed Sissoko scored his first goal after 75 matches at Liverpool to put them ahead while Andriy Voronin added the second three minutes from time. Bolton picked up their first points after three straight defeats with goals from Gary Speed, Nicolas Anelka and substitute Daniel Braaten giving them a 3-0 win over Reading. Aston Villa beat Fulham 2-1 at Villa Park for their first win of the season with substitute Shaun Maloney's goal in the final minute securing the points while James McFadden's 78th-minute volley earned Everton a point after Roque Santa Cruz had given Blackburn the lead at Goodison Park. Cameron Jerome scored twice to give Birmingham City a 2-1 win at Derby County, promoted with the Blues, but now languishing in bottom place with one point from their opening four matches. They are in good company however, with champions Manchester United, who play Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford on Sunday, one point and one place above them
