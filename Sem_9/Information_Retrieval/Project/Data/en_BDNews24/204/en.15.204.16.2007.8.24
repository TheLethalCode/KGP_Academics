 GENEVA, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Swiss judicial authorities on Friday said they had lifted a freeze on all funds related to the Russian bankrupt oil firm YUKOS, worth some 200-300 million Swiss francs ($165.8-$248.8 million). The move follows a Thursday ruling by Switzerland's highest court blocking a Swiss government bid to give Russia documents linked to bank accounts held by former Yukos owners, including Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev, and several companies. The landmark ruling by the Lausanne-based Tribunal Federal, or Supreme Court, halted Swiss cooperation with Russia in a criminal case which the five judges said seemed aimed at ousting "political rivals". "I can confirm we have lifted the freeze on the 200 to 300 million Swiss francs frozen in Swiss banks," Maria Schnebli, a federal prosecutor in the Swiss attorney general's office, told Reuters from Berne. "That is the end of it." The freeze had been lifted on all Swiss accounts linked to Yukos, not just those covered by the ruling, she said, adding: "The Supreme Court...said that mutual legal assistance cannot be given to Russia in this case." The Swiss ruling concluded "that the (Russian) penal procedure in the case at hand is being manoeuvred by the powers that be with the intention to rein in the class of rich 'oligarchs' and sideline potential or declared political adversaries." Lawyers for Khodorkovsky and Lebedev welcomed the decision, noting it was the first time the top Swiss court had invoked political persecution and human rights violations as grounds for not helping foreign authorities to pursue a criminal matter. "What is striking about the decision is that the Swiss Federal Court has made it blatantly obvious that the Russian Federation in the Yukos case is not complicit with international law," Robert Amsterdam, a lawyer for Khodorkovsky, told a news conference in Geneva. "We have taken the point from the initial moment of the charges in 2003 right through to the show trial that this case was not being conducted according to either Russian or international law," he added. Kodorkovsky and Lebedev are each serving an eight-year prison term in Siberia on charges of fraud and tax evasion. The Swiss court said the two should not have been sent to prison camps in Siberia as Russian law provided for the place of detention to be close to their home or place of trial. Russia last week sold the last big asset of Yukos, once the country's largest oil producer. State-controlled Rosneft, now Russia's largest oil firm, bought refineries and other assets from Yukos at a state-forced auction earlier this year.
