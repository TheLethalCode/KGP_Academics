<TITLE> Syria tightens border, more needed-Iraqi minister </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 DAMASCUS, Aug 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Syria has made progress in curbing infiltration of fighters and weapons into Iraq but has yet to take more effective measures to seal the border, the Iraqi interior minister said on Wednesday. "The Syrians have done good work away from the eyes of the media. According to my information, they have arrested armed groups who intended to cross into Iraq," Jawad al-Bolani told Reuters after high-level security meetings in Damascus. "But the border problem will take time to resolve. I affirmed in my meetings the need to take practical measures," said Bolani, who is accompanying Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki on a visit to Syria. A White House spokesman said Washington hoped that Maliki had delivered a message to Syria to stop "allowing foreign fighters, extremists, to enter Iraq through your country". Iraqi officials have complained that Syria has been slow to take action in accordance with past security agreements, including handing over suspects accused by Iraq of playing a role in the insurgency. Bolani, a former air force officer in the Saddam Hussein era, said the focus in the short term would be on joint security measures along the 360-km (225-mile) border. Syria, which opposed the US-led invasion of Iraq, agreed at an international security conference in Damascus this month to participate in an intelligence network to help the Iraqi government counter border infiltration. "We are working on activating joint border patrols and reconnaissance teams with Syria and setting up communication channels. The two border commanders will soon meet and conduct field trips together," said Bolani, who has visited Syria twice already to discuss security. "My visit this time is different and it is successful. We said clearly that Syria's security is inseparable from Iraq. "The whole region is facing huge security problems and we're dealing directly with terrorism, but this will not be confined to Iraq for long," Bolani said in an interview. Bolani said Syrian security officials told him they were in the midst of a campaign of their own against militants and that they have dismantled al-Qaeda training camps with links to Iraq. Syria also said this month that six of its border soldiers had been killed by attacks launched from inside Iraq. Bolani said Syrian officials were adamant about not tolerating militants emboldened by the chaos in Iraq. "We have now a common vision about countering the terrorism and extremism we're up against," he said. "This is a step forward."
