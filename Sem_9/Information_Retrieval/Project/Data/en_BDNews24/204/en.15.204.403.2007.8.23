 DHAKA, Aug 23 (Reuters/bdnews24.com)  The usually bustling capital looked largely deserted Thursday, after the army-backed interim government imposed an indefinite curfew the previous night in a bid to end days of violence. Streets were empty except for a few rickshaws and troop carriers with mounted guns. The carriers often forced the few curious onlookers and pedestrians into narrow alleys, as the curfew was strictly enforced. Hundreds of incoming passengers, and relatives and friends who had gone to receive them, spent the night at Dhaka airport following the sudden imposition of curfew, officials said. The home ministry ordered the curfew to be relaxed for three hours from 4pm Thursday to allow people stranded at airports and elsewhere to return home and stock up on essentials. The authorities shut government, semi-government and autonomous organisations and courts for Thursday. The law courts in Old Dhaka looked desolate, without justice seekers, lawyers and magistrates. One man was killed and nearly 300 people injured in clashes between police and students, joined by some members of the public, in Dhaka and elsewhere over the last three days before the curfew was imposed in the capital and five other main cities. The trouble -- which analysts said had shaken the government but did not appear to pose a serious immediate threat to it -- started Monday night. "They are not in any danger of falling," said Asif Nazrul who teaches law at Dhaka University. The latest violence was triggered by a troop assault on students after they protested the presence of soldiers at a football match at Dhaka University's gymnasium compound. Troops had been based in the complex since January when a military-backed interim administration took power following months of political violence. The government shut down the army camp Tuesday night after the clashes. One resident of the city of 11 million people said he had walked 8km to visit a relative in hospital. "All I saw on the road were security vehicles and one or two ambulances," said Mohammad Ibrahim. A US embassy spokesman welcomed the government's assurance to lift the curfew as soon as the situation improved and urged all parties to refrain from violence and provocation. CONSPIRACY In a televised speech Wednesday, interim government chief Fakhruddin Ahmed called the violence a "conspiracy" and said measures to control it would be withdrawn when the situation improves. The government also ordered universities and colleges in six cities including Dhaka shut until further notice, telling students to vacate dormitories. Dhaka University's 40,000-strong campus was deserted with police and troops patrolling nearby streets and no visible protests, witnesses said. Students have played a key role in political movements in the past but the interim authority recently said it planned to ban student politics, or at least prevent them from working for the major political parties. This has angered both the students and many of their teachers, education officials said, while the political parties have also supported them and repeated their calls for an immediate end to a nationwide ban on political activity. bd
