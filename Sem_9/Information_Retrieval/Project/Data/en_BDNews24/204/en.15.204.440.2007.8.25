<TITLE> Dhaka streets buzz as curfew eases </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com)  Streets and markets were bustling Saturday as the government suspended the curfew for 17 hours to 11 pm. Traffic and usual chaos returned to the streets but there was no sign of protest that swept the city of 10 million people a few days ago, prompting the government to enforce the curfew. It seems that the violence has been quelled. Five other biggest cities also experienced a normal day Saturday. Despite being a weekend day, people came out of their homes and many private sector officials attended their offices to clear their work backlog. The city markets got their regular chaos back with a huge influx of shoppers. Workers of the city's garment factories returned to their work, and in the morning usual flow of the workers was visible on the streets. "I am going to visit my mother in Uttara," Salina Chowdhury, a housewife, told bdnews24.com in the city's Kalabagan area. "We've passed a difficult time over past three days," Chowdhury said. "It must be over." The new suspension came after an eight-hour night curfew as the restrictions had resumed at 10pm Friday after a 14-hour break Friday. Late Friday, the mobile phone networks also went back up after they were switched off sometime late afternoon. The government in a new order Friday night said the restrictions on movement would have a 17-hour pause from 6am for Saturday. The cellphone networks went dead around 4pm to 9pm Thursday and again from around midnight to 3am. On Wednesday, the first day of curfew, they stopped from 6pm as curfew approached. The operators had initially said they were asked to put it off until 8:30pm but the system didn't return to life until around 7am the following morning. The violence erupted at the Dhaka University Monday, spreading to college campuses across the country and then onto city streets and highways. A string of clashes between the students and the security officials left one man dead and at least 300 people injured. As the violent protests spilled out of the campuses onto the Dhaka streets Wednesday, many common people, specially hawkers hit hard by the government's eviction drive from the streets, also joined in. The people, who live by the day, are the worst victims of the curfew though it has brought a sense of calmness among many citizens
