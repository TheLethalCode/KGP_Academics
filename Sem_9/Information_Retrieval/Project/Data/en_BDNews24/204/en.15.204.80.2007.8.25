 ATHENS, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Greek government declared the entire country in a state of emergency on Saturday after forest fires killed at least 44 people in the southern Peloponnese region. "All regions of the country are declared in a state of emergency," Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis said in an address to the nation. Scores of fires have swept through the Peloponnese and other regions since Friday, trapping hundreds in villages. Karamanlis said the multiple fronts "can't be a coincidence" and promised the culprits would be found and punished.
