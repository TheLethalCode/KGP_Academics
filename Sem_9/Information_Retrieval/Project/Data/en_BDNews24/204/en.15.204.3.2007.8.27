<TITLE> BTTB's submarine cable link breaks down again </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com)  The Chittagong-Cox's Bazar fibre optic transmission link with the country's only submarine cable snapped again at 2:30pm Monday, Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board said. In a statement, BTTB said the link snapped at Chokoria, some 120 kilometres off Chittagong towards Cox's Bazar, the second time it has gone down with in a week. The telecoms system broke down earlier on Wednesday, isolating Bangladesh from the rest of the world for 19 hours after suspected saboteurs cut off the Chittagong-Cox's Bazar underground optical fibre transmission link. Monday's scene of incident is close to Wednesday's place of occurrence, but BTTB did not confirm if it was an act of sabotage. Officials at the state telecoms provider said a few international voice circuits had been temporarily diverted through the satellite backup links. The BTTB officials also admitted "slight congestion" in the overseas phone and "temporarily disrupted" internet services. They said a technical team has started repairing the damaged cable, but would not say when the link would be back on. The BTTB chairman refused to talk to bdnews24.com. bdn
