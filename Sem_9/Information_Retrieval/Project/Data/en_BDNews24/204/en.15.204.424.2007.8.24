 PARIS, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - France said on Friday it may be prepared to provide assistance to Iraqi troops and police, a further sign of a thaw in relations with the United States after its foreign minister visited Baghdad this week. Bernard Kouchner's three-day trip to Baghdad was seen as part of President Nicolas Sarkozy's effort to improve relations with Washington after a bitter fallout over the US-led invasion under previous president Jacques Chirac. "Our intention is not to send French soldiers to Iraq. But we can perhaps see what we can do in terms of assistance to the police or the authorities that are in charge of providing security in Iraq," French Foreign Ministry Spokesman Denis Simonneau told a news conference. Under Chirac, France was one of the staunchest opponents of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, prompting a sharp deterioration in relations between Paris and Washington. Kouchner, whose trip to Baghdad was the first by a top French official since the war, had raised the issue in his meetings with Iraqi officials and he intended to discuss it at a meeting of EU foreign ministers next month, Simonneau said. During his trip, Kouchner also called for Europe to play a bigger role in Iraq. Kouchner had described the conditions in which Iraqi police work, saying that there was one pistol for five police officers, Simonneau said. France offered years ago to train Iraqi security forces, he said. "We offered training a long time ago, almost three years ago now, training, but for various reasons there was prevarication and it was not implemented," Simonneau said, adding that aid should be provided "not only at the national level but also at the European level within the framework of the United Nations". France's position, established under the previous government, that U.S. and other foreign forces should withdraw from Iraq by 2008, had not changed, Simonneau said. He added, however, that the international community should look at providing economic assistance to the country. "We have to see how the international community can act in the field of economic development on a certain number of subjects," he said.
