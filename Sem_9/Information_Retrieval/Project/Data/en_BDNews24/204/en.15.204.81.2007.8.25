 Dhaka, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com) -- Prof AFM Yusuf Haider Saturday said chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed had assured that the two detained teachers would be treated with honour. The acting vice chancellor of Dhaka University made the disclosure at a press conference at his home after a meeting with the chief adviser at about 3.30pm. A Dhaka court ordered remand for DU teachers Prof Anwar Hossain and Harun-or-Rashid Saturday after they were arrested with alleged links to the DU violence. The acting vice-chancellor said that none would be unnecessarily harassed in the cases filed in connection with the clashes on the campus. The law enforcers had been directed to make sure that nobody is unnecessarily harassed, Prof Yusuf quoted the CA as saying. He said that the chief adviser had told him the teachers would get proper legal aid. "I hope the environment in the university becomes normal soon," Prof Yusuf said. On when the DU would reopen he said, "The government is alert in this regard. The chief adviser has informed me that all universities and colleges will be reopened after the situation becomes normal." Asked whether the detained teachers would be provided with legal aid on behalf of the university, he averted a direct reply and said: "Law will take its own course. They will get due legal assistance." bdnews24.
