 MANILA, August 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan and 10 Southeast Asian countries agreed on Saturday to reduce barriers to trade in a deal that will make Japan's markets more accessible to Southeast Asia and increase Japanese investment in the region. "All the parties were able to finalise their lists for regional exchange of concessions for trade in goods," Japanese Trade Minister Akira Amari said. "This will be one step toward furthering economic integration in the East Asian region," he told reporters. Amari said the deal would particularly boost Japan's investment in Southeast Asia's electronics industries. "It will help the movement of these (electronics) parts in the region and will promote even further the electronics industry in the ASEAN region through its liberalisation measures." Japan is one of the two biggest trade partners of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and two-way trade was worth over $160 billion in 2006. The deal is the latest in a series of regional and bilateral trade pacts, but it is Japan's first regional accord. It will be signed at a summit in Singapore in November after officials complete work on the details. ASEAN -- comprising the six richer members of Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines and Brunei -- and four poorer recent members -- Vietnam, Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos -- is one of the world's most dynamic economic regions, with a regional gross domestic product of $1.1 trillion. But the bloc of 570 million people has made only slow progress towards its own economic integration. Although a free-trade area is in place, eliminating most tariffs on trade within the region, the members have much work to do in areas such as transport infrastructure, food, tourism and free movement of labour to reach their goal of an ASEAN Economic Community by 2015. "The agreement would allow ASEAN to sell more in Japan and get more investment from Japan," ASEAN Secretary-General Ong Keng Yong told reporters. Japan is already the second biggest source of foreign direct investment in ASEAN members, after the European Union, with an 18 percent share of the $171 billion that the region attracted between 2002 and 2006. Under the deal, which applies to trade in goods, not services, Japan will eliminate tariffs on 93 percent of products imported from Southeast Asia over 10 years, and the six richer ASEAN countries will cut tariffs to zero on at least 90 percent of goods they import from Japan. The four poorer ASEAN members are offering to cut tariffs on about 88-90 percent of Japanese imports, a Filipino official said. The imports exempted from the deal are sensitive products, such as rice in the case of Japan, and automobile parts or textiles in the case of some of the ASEAN countries. Japan is ASEAN's biggest source of imports and its third biggest export market. The deal is likely to boost Japanese exports further, increasing two-way trade overall, officials said.
