 MEXICO CITY, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cesar Luis Menotti, the chain-smoking coach who led Argentina to World Cup victory in 1978, is to return to the touchline after a two-year absence to coach modest Mexican side Tecos UAG. The Guadalajara-based club named Menotti as their coach on Thursday, where he will replace compatriot Dario Franco who was fired after only three games of the season. "He's a great football encyclopaedia," UAG president Antonio Leano told reporters as he confirmed the appointment. "He's a person who meets all our requirements." The 68-year-old's previous job was at Independiente in his homeland where he lasted only nine matches before resigning in April 2005. Leano said Menotti would have to achieve results in the short term as well as implanting a long-term youth development programme. "He's bringing a very interesting project to work at grass-roots level, it's very ambitious," said Leano. Since the 1978 World Cup, Menotti has coached the Mexican national team, Argentine clubs Boca Juniors and River Plate, Uruguay's Penarol, Italy's Sampdoria and Spain's Barcelona, among others
