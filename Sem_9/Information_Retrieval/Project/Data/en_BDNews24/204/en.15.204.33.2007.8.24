 KATHMANDU, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nepal's multi-party government said on Thursday it had taken the ownership of ancient palaces of unpopular King Gyanendra, including his official residence in the heart of Kathmandu, the country's capital. But the monarch and his family will continue to stay in the sprawling Narayanhity palace in Kathmandu until an assembly due to be elected this year decides whether to retain the monarchy or turn the Himalayan nation into a republic, a minister said.

Officials say the property of the slain royals will be used for a charity to be run by the government. Traditionally, kings have been revered in the majority-Hindu Nepal as gods. But the monarchy's popularity plunged in 2005 when Gyanendra fired the government and took absolute power, saying the move was vital to crush a deadly Maoist insurgency -- a conflict that killed more than 13,000 people. But weeks of violent street protests, backed by the Maoists, last year forced him to hand back power to political parties. The new government quickly stripped the king of his powers, including his control over the army. The Maoists, who began their anti-monarchy revolt in 1996, are now in the government under a power-sharing deal with mainstream parties, and are pushing for abolition of monarc
