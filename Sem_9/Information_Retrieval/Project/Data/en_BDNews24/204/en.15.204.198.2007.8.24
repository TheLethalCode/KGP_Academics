<TITLE> Leterme seen leading Belgium despite coalition blow </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BRUSSELS, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Christian Democrat Yves Leterme is still likely to head Belgium's next government despite quitting as coalition builder after an impasse over his plans to reform the state, commentators said on Friday. They said that Leterme's likely coalition would still exclude the socialists, who lost out in June elections, and involve much-debated reform that would devolve power to regional governments. "The country needs a cooling-off period," said Kris Deschouwer, political scientist at the Free University of Brussels. "In the end, Yves Leterme will be back. No government is possible without his party and his party will not kill him." Even francophone commentators, while flagging outgoing Finance Minister Didier Reynders as a possible prime ministerial candidate, said there was no alternative to Leterme. "(Leterme) has been reinforced by the crisis and legitimised in the eyes of the Flemish," Beatrice Delvaux, editor-in-chief of national francophone daily Le Soir, told Reuters. "It is very likely that he will be the next prime minister ... It would be very difficult to have a francophone prime minister." Leterme, appointed by King Albert to form a coalition between Christian Democrats and liberals on both sides of the linguistic divide, quit on Thursday over the negotiation impasse. His CD&V party from Flanders, the northern Dutch-speaking region of Belgium, scooped the popular vote in the June election largely on a ticket of reform that would devolve more power to regional governments, something French-speakers opposed. Even if Leterme does lead the next government, commentators said both sides would have to move into the middle ground. "Everyone -- Flemish and French speakers -- has an interest in having a reasonable dialogue. If not, radicalisation looms, mostly on the Flemish side," columnist Peter Vandermeersch wrote in Flemish (Dutch) daily De Standaard. "Whoever continues to refuse a far-reaching devolution could well be preparing the ground for separatism." While newspapers in Belgium have been rife in the past few days with talk of the country breaking up, commentators said that was an unlikely scenario. "The alternative -- to end Belgium -- is far more difficult than agreeing on a coalition government," political scientist Deschouwer said. Carl Devos, political scientist at the University of Ghent, said: "There is no majority even in Flanders on the splitting of the country."
