<TITLE> Photo-Me says CEO and chairman to leave soon </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Photo booth operator Photo-Me International Plc, bowing to pressure from activist investors on Friday, said its chairman and chief executive would both stand down. Photo-Me said Chief Executive Serge Crasnianski proposed to retire in the next few months, and non-executive Chairman Vernon Sankey would not seek re-election as a director at the annual general meeting on Oct. 17. Photo-Me, which has around 22,000 photo booths in railway stations and other locations, said the departures would render unnecessary a meeting called by activist investors. The company's statement came a day after activist investors Principle Capital and Cycladic, which together own 18.2 percent of Photo-Me's shares, called for an extraordinary shareholders' meeting to vote out the CEO and chairman, saying they had lost confidence in their abilities. They fear the group's photo booth division, its most profitable unit which is up for sale, will be sold too cheaply. Sankey said continued calls for the two men's immediate resignations at an EGM would damage the business and that this should be a suitable compromise. "To brutally remove the CEO is madness," the chairman told Reuters by phone on Friday. "He has the loyalty of many people within the business, and the damage caused within the business would be enormous." SEEKING SMOOTH TRANSITION Sankey and the rest of the board want a smooth transition in which Crasnianski would leave by the end of the year at the latest, giving him time to hand over to a new CEO. Photo-Me shares rose 10 percent to 66.25 pence by 1152 GMT as investors saw that a compromise appears to have been reached and the sale still looks in good shape, a trader said. The stock is still at a fraction of its peak of around 470 pence in early 2000. Sankey said there was a "fair chance" of selling the company's largest division at a price that would satisfy the majority of its investors, who will get to vote on a potential sale. A spokesman for Principle said on Thursday the investors wants the photo booth division to be sold for significantly more than the 200 million pound ($400.6 million) market value of the company, as it stood yesterday. Principle could not immediately be reached for comment on Friday. One source familiar with the negotiations told Reuters that before the recent credit crunch he felt a deal could be done at around 300 million pounds. Sankey said Principle might be trying to scupper the sale of the booth division and keep it within the firm. Earlier in the summer the shareholder called for an EGM to vote down sale plans. But Sankey said a deal could get the backing of the majority of shareholders even if Principle thinks it is not high enough.
