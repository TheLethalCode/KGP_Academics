<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia did not appear in court Sunday for the hearing of the Dinkal Publication case and sought more time through her lawyers. Metropolitan magistrate AJM Abdullah Hel Baki granted the appeal and set Sept 27 for the former prime minister to submit a written reply. Khaleda's lawyers also turned in an explanation to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka, saying Khaleda could not appear in court for "security concerns" stemming from the recent violence across the country. The lawyers pressed another point in court that a petition had been filed with the High Court, seeking liquidation of Dinkal Publication Ltd in line with the Companies Act. They said the hearing on the HC appeal was set for Aug 27, which requires more time to prepare for. On June 22, the Office of the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms filed the case with the CMM's Court accusing 13 people, including Khaleda, of not submitting annual financial statements of Dinkal Publication Ltd. Khaleda is a director of the company. Lawyers Sanaullah Miah, Masud Ahmed Talukder, Khorshed Alam and barrister Nawshad Zamir defended Khaleda in court. In his appeal, the plaintiff said the Companies Act makes it mandatory for a joint stock company to submit annual financial statements, AGM schedule and audited reports to the Office of the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms within 18 months of registration and every year afterwards. But Dinkal Publication Ltd did not do so, which is a financial crime under law, according to case details. The accused in the case include Khaleda's son Tarique Rahman, Giasuddin Al Mamun, Sheikh Razzak Ali, barrister Nazmul Huda and retired major Abdul Mannan. bdnews24
