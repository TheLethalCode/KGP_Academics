 CAIRO, Aug 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Egyptian police detained two Muslim Brotherhood lawmakers on Wednesday, increasing pressure that analysts and the opposition group say could lead to a new high-profile trial of group leaders. Police rounded up the two lawmakers, Ragab Abu Zeid and Sabri Amer, at their homes in the Nile Delta province of Menoufiya and later raided their offices, a Muslim Brotherhood statement said. Police sources confirmed the detentions. The two men were briefly detained in May and the parliament later lifted their immunity from prosecution. The government says the Brotherhood is banned but the group operates openly and its members, running as independents, control one-fifth of seats in parliament. The detentions come five days after police broke up a Brotherhood meeting in Cairo and arrested 17 leaders, including the head of the group's political department Essam el-Erian and Mahmoud Hussein, a member of its top Guidance Office. Forty members of the Brotherhood, including third-in-command Khairat el-Shatir, are standing military trial on charges that include terrorism and money laundering. Local and international human rights organisations, including Amnesty International, have condemned the proceedings. "Many in the Brotherhood feel that the arrest of Essam el-Erian and Mahmoud Hussein ... and today's incident indicate that a new military trial is in the works. If not military, then it would be before an emergency court," a Brotherhood source told Reuters. "It feels like 1995 all over," said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to talk to the media. He was referring to the year that saw three military trials of Brotherhood leaders, including Erian and Shatir. Mohamed Habib, the group's deputy leader, was more cautious. "I doubt that ... but everything is possible," he said. "What is clear though is that there is an escalation from the regime," he told Reuters. Analysts say the government is eager to head off further Brotherhood electoral gains that could help it mount a real threat to Mubarak, Egypt's longest-serving ruler since Mohamed Ali Pasha in the 19th century. "The state appears to be preparing for something big," said political analyst Diaa Rashwan. "Whether this could lead to a military trial or not it is hard to predict but the indicators do not rule this out." He said even if Erian and Mahmoud were not referred to a military court, they are likely to appear before the Supreme State Security Emergency Court, not before a civilian judge. In many cases, authorities have kept Brotherhood members in detention for long periods before releasing them without charge. But Mohamed Salah, an expert on Islamist groups, said all Brotherhood senior leaders detained at group meetings were eventually referred to trial.
