 MONTPELLIER, France, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ronaldinho, starting as a substitute after declining to take part in last month's Copa America, came off the bench to score the second goal in Brazil's 2-0 friendly win over Algeria on Wednesday. Full back Maicon opened the scoring just after the hour in Brazil's first match since they won the Copa America in Venezuela last month. Ronaldinho and Kaka, who said they were too tired to play at the Copa, both started on the bench after being told by coach Dunga they would have to win back their places in the side. The pair were brought on at halftime as Dunga made seven substitutions. Brazil managed only two first half chances, with Algeria goalkeeper Lounes Gouaoui parrying away shots from Robinho and Julio Baptista. Algeria, with most of the crowd behind them, enjoyed plenty of possession and played with confidence. Rafik Saifi wasted their best first-half chance when he was sent clear by Karim Ziani but showed too much of the ball to Doni and allowed the Brazil goalkeeper, diving at his feet, to get a hand to the ball. Ronaldinho had a chance to score when Brazil won a free kick but his shot went into Gouaoui's arms from 25 metres. Algeria were close in the 55th minute when Karim Matmour dispossessed Fernando in midfield and produced a curling shot from the edge of the area which substitute goalkeeper Julio Cesar did well to save. As Brazil turned the screws, Kaka's volley hit a defender with Gouaoui beaten, then Fernando was close with a long-range shot which bounced off the North African keeper. Brazil went ahead from the resulting corner as Ronaldinho's inswinging corner was met by Maicon, who headed in from close-range at the near post in the 62nd minute. Ronaldinho added the second with nine minutes left, calmly slotting home the rebound from a narrow angle after Diego's shot was blocked by Gouaoui
