 Dhaka, August 23 (bdnews24.com)  Thousands of homebound students of Jahangirnagar University were caught in the curfew Thursday after authorities had given them three hours to leave the halls by 8:00pm Wednesday. The women students vacated their halls Thursday morning but were yet to get transports. bdnews24.com JU correspondent Aminur Rahman Russell said troops launched a simultaneous two-hour raids on six residential halls of the university starting at 2:30am. The raiders took 28 students from Moulana Bhashani Hall and 20 from Kamaluddin Hall but freed them at Nabinagar intersection. Shahriar Kanchan, a fourth-year English honours student, said though he had left the campus Wednesday evening, he failed to catch a bus. He spent the night with some 25 other students at a home at Srirampur village near the campus. A few hundred women students were waiting insecurely for transports at the vehicle 'park' on the campus until midday. "I need to go to Dinajpur, but no bus is operating. I got no response from Nabil Paribahan despite making numerous calls. "My younger brother hid behind a bush all night. We heard students were being hauled away in Dhaka and beaten mercilessly. Now I can't take him to Dhaka," Soheli Shimu, a student of anthropology, said. Students do not know where to take shelter or how to get out of the trouble as the long-distance buses and launches were not operating, she said. Shaid Ali of Nabil Paribahan said, "We cannot run our long-distance buses, as we are not sure that buses will safely reach their destinations." Thousands of students finding are desperately knocking at any door they know or heard about from their relatives to take refuge for a while. bdnews
