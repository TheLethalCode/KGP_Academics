 PARIS, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks reversed earlier losses and briefly turned positive on Friday after a US government report showed orders for durable goods for July came in much higher than expected. At 1239 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was flat at 1,509.15 points, after moving into positive territory shortly after the data was released. The report showed that new orders for US durable goods jumped 5.9 percent in July, after a revised 1.9 percent increase in June. Markets were expecting a 1.0 percent gain in US durables, according to a Reuters poll.
