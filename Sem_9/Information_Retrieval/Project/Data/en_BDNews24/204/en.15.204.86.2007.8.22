<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 22 (bdnews24.com)  The Dhaka University Teachers' Association (DUTA) Wednesday renewed its demand to the government to lift the state of emergency. Teachers under the umbrella of DUTA took out a silent procession starting from Aparajeyo Bangla and marched to the Central Shaheed Minar at 11:30am, defying a ban on processions and rallies under emergency rules. Thousands of students joined the procession in a show of solidarity with the teachers. "Some of our demands placed Tuesday are still unmet, the most crucial of which is our demand that the caretaker government immediately revoke the emergency rules," said Professor Anwar Hossain, the DUTA general secretary. Anwar however thanked the government for meeting some of their demands placed earlier and hoped the emergency government would concede to others unmet. The demands came amid clashes between police and students on the Dhaka University campus for a third straight day Wednesday. Police in riot cars chased demonstrators near the Nilkhet cross-section and fired tear gas in an effort to disperse them. The demonstrating students vandalised an auto-rickshaw outside the vice chancellor's home at around 11:45am bdnews24.com/sh
