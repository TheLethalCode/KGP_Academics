 SYDNEY, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Richard Hadlee, Dion Nash and Glenn Turner have been reappointed as New Zealand's national selectors. The three men were offered new contracts after former New Zealand captain and Indian coach John Wright was overlooked for a place on the panel. Wright was recently appointed to a high performance role and New Zealand Cricket chief executive Justin Vaughan said the board wanted him to settle into his new job before taking on the extra responsibilities of selection.

"We felt he (Wright) would be best to reacquaint himself with the players in New Zealand before any decision is made on whether he should be included on the panel.
