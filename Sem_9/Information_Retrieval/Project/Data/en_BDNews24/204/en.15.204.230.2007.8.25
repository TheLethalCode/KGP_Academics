 Shariatpur, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com)  Army chief General Moeen U Ahmed restated Saturday that the general election would be held by the end of 2008. "People want to have good politicians. I urge politicians to participate in the electoral process to serve the people as their duly elected representatives," Moeen told a meeting with civil-society representatives and others at Shariatpur Circuit House. On the floods, Moeen said: "The government should work in unison with the army and other people to rehabilitate all those affected by the floods." "Diarrhoea and diseases of the eye have broken out in many flood-affected areas. "Medical teams have been posted in all 53 unions of Shariatpur district," he said. "If the medical teams operate efficiently, not a single man or woman will die due to a lack of treatment." Moeen said: "The flooding caused more damage to educational institutions, roads and houses than to agriculture." "Time and money are required to recover these losses. It is our collective duty to help boost the morale of all those affected," he said. Prior to the discussion, the army chief distributed relief to 300 flood-hit families in Shariatpur. bdnews2
