<TITLE> Bankers spell out concern over kerb-market dollar trade </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com) -- Bankers Sunday expressed concerns over the current spate of devaluation of the taka against the dollar on the kerb market. Bangladesh Foreign Exchange Dealers Association (BAFEDA), a platform of foreign exchange trading banks, has claimed that the dollar strengthened against the taka on the open market, "partly because of the flight of the greenback out of the country". Syed Abu Naser Bukhtiar Ahmed, managing director of state-run Agrani Bank and chairman of BAFEDA, made the observations in a briefing with reporters after a meeting of the association's executive committee in its Kakrail office. "The supply shortage has also pushed the value of the dollar on the open market," Ahmed told reporters. He said the dollar traded against the Bangladesh currency Tk 2.5-Tk 3 higher on the kerb market than in banks. "Generally, people who buy dollars from the open market suffer the most from the price increase," Ahmed said. "Dollars could be smuggled out too," he said. The BAFEDA chairman said people who tour India take more dollars than they are allowed to ($1,000). Neither the central bank nor the BAFEDA has enough measures to control the kerb-market dollar trading, he said. According to Bangladesh Bank, the inter-bank selling rate for the dollar was Tk 68.7 Sunday, while its buying rate was Tk 68.7. On the other hand, the selling rate for the dollar was between Tk 69.5 and Tk 70.5 on the kerb market. bdnews
