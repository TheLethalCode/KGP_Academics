 Dhaka, Aug 22 (bdnews24.com) -- Hundreds of thousands of people walked home as the news of the curfew spread amid a flare of emergency-time violence that swept much across the country. The order derailed public transports. Buses stayed off the roads. Only rickshaws and some autorickshaws plied on, but they were too inadequate for thousands of passengers waiting by the side of the road to reach home before the curfew started at 8pm Wednesday. Hundreds of people were standing stranded on the streets after the curfew started, as transports were unavailable. The government ordered all universities and colleges in divisional towns to shut indefinitely and asked students to leave dormitories by 8pm Wednesday, according to a notice. "The curfew will continue until further notice," the government said in a statement. The sudden order caught thousands of students off-guard. Many of them moved out of the dormitories and many stayed back as they had nowhere to go. bdnews24.com correspondents saw hundreds of students lug their bags down the road in and out of the Dhaka University campus. CLAMPDOWN ON MOBILES The government ordered all mobile phone operators to suspend services from 6pm Wednesday. Such unannounced shutdown of widely used nationwide communication networks further panicked the millions of frantic homebound people desperate to avert the curfew. "My husband started from Mohakhali and I have been walking from Dhanmondi and now we cannot call each other anymore," Afroza Begum, a mother of two who lives in Agargaon told bdnews24.com at Asad Gate. Senior executives of various mobile phone companies were reluctant to discuss the matter. "We are just following the government's order and please don't ask us anything more," one of them said. bdn
