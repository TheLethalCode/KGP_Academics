 Sajjadur Rahman bdnews24.com Senior Business Correspondent Dhaka, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh appears to be becoming increasingly reliant on International Monetary Fund policies, at a time when most countries are retreating from its assistance in light of widespread concerns over IMF's impact on developing economies. An IMF team led by Thomas Rumbaugh, its Asia and Pacific Department adviser, is due to arrive in Bangladesh on Sept 4 for a two-week visit. The team will sit with top advisers and economic policymakers to discuss plans to replace the Poverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF) with the Policy Support Instrument (PSI) in an attempt to convince Bangladesh to follow its prescriptions. Qazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmed, president of Bangladesh Economic Association, told bdnews24.com: "I see no rationale in adopting the IMF-pushed PSI." Initiated in 2005, the PSI was designed for low-income countries that have not received any loans from IMF but nevertheless accept the agency's advice in policymaking. Despite all, the PSI does come with conditions, which are updated at programme reviews every six months. As a consequence the PSI serves as an arbiter to signal donors that the IMF has endorsed a country's economic programme. Kholiquzzaman said: "The country's economic policy should be grounded in its own context, not imposed by the IMF or World Bank." "If the deal goes ahead it would go against the country's sovereignty," he added. Zaid Bakht, research director of Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies, said: "We should not be obliged to follow the policy prescriptions of the IMF." "I don't say IMF policy is always bad. Bangladesh can always seek advice from the Fund as a member country." "It would not be wise for the interim government to make such a deal with the IMF," he said. Worldwide, even IMF's major borrowers have stopped seeking assistance from the multilateral agency in recent years. Turkey, Indonesia, Argentina and Brazil together account for approximately 70 percent of IMF's outstanding loans. In recent years, the countries have all announced their intention to dispose of the loans as soon as possible in a bid to circumvent what they describe as onerous conditions pegged to the loans. As a result, outstanding IMF loans have plummeted by more than a half, from $90 billion in 2004 to about $40 billion in 2006. Despite this global trend, Bangladesh seems to be accelerating its adoption of new IMF policies. Because of the PSI, economists say, the IMF's role will become that of an international credit rating agency that notifies other donor agencies whether to provide loans for Bangladesh. The agency will not provide its own financial support. However, under the new provision the IMF will not contribute a single penny towards the economic well-being of a country. Experts say even without the injection of IMF funds the country will still be subject to IMF conditions as a result of the new instrument's structure. They added that it would be folly for the interim government to strike such a policy deal under the existing conditions. The PSI policy, slated for implementation in Bangladesh, has been running in five other countries since 2005, all poor African nations. If the plan goes ahead Bangladesh would be the sixth PSI country after Nigeria, Ghana, Uganda, Cape Verde and Tanzania to come under its provisions. Six PSI programme documents have been made publicly available, two from Uganda, three from Nigeria, and one from Cape Verde. They reveal that on average the agreements contained 12 separate assessment criteria or benchmarks. This compares unfavourably to a review of PRGF conditions conducted by the Brussels-based NGO Eurodad in 2006. So far each Nigerian PSI review has included three privatisation conditions, which remain one of the most controversial forms of economic policy. Officials from the finance ministry have confirmed that a file has been forwarded to the finance adviser seeking approval for further discussions on these issues with IMF representatives. bd
