<TEXT>
 OSAKA, Japan, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Portugal's Nelson Evora gave three nations cause to cheer when he won the triple jump world title with a leap of 17.74 metres on Monday. Evora was born in the Ivory Coast and represented his parent's native Cape Verde Islands until 2002 when he was granted citizenship by Portugal, where he moved as a young boy. The 23-year-old set out his stall with his first jump of the night and his 17.41 metres was better than all but one of his competitors could manage over the rest of the final. But his best was yet to come and on his third attempt he launched himself down the track and hopped, skipped and jumped a new Portuguese national record that was enough for victory. Brazil's Jadel Gregorio, who owns the best leap of the year at 17.90m, left it until late before making 17.59m on his penultimate attempt to claim silver. Defending champion Walter Davis claimed bronze with his first attempt of 17.33m but it was a close run thing, with Cuban Osniel Tosca and his fellow American Aarik Wilson one and two centimetres back respectively
