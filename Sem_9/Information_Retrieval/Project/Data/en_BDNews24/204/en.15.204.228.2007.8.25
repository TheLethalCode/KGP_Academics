 GAZA, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two Palestinian gunmen who climbed over Israel's border fence with the Gaza Strip on Saturday attacked a military base and made their way towards a civilian community before soldiers tracked them down and killed them. In the occupied West Bank, an Israeli force disguised as Palestinians killed the local head of the Islamic Jihad group in the city of Jenin and a bystander, Palestinian ambulance crews said. The incidents were part of a surge of weekend violence in which eight Palestinians were killed by Israeli troops. All but two -- a 13-year-old Israeli Arab boy visiting relatives in the West Bank and the bystander in Jenin -- were gunmen. Later, Gaza militants set off a roadside bomb at an Israeli army vehicle on a routine patrol along the border in the southern part of the strip, lightly wounding four soldiers. The armed wing of Islamist group Hamas, which in June seized control of the Gaza Strip following a bloody battle with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's secular Fatah, claimed responsibility for the attack. The Israeli army said the two gunmen who crossed into Israel early on Saturday morning used a ladder to scale the high Gaza border wall and a rope to lower themselves on the other side. They used the morning fog as cover as they made their way to the Israeli military's coordination office with the Palestinians at the Erez crossing point. An army officer who briefed reporters by telephone said the gunmen fired automatic weapons and hurled grenades at a guard at the facility who shot back. "They were forced towards (the civilian community) of Netiv Ha'asara, where a Golani (infantry) force engaged and killed both of them," said Major Tal Lev-Ram, estimating the two had penetrated some 700 metres (yards) into Israel. The Popular Resistance Committees (PRC), a militant group in Gaza, said one of its gunmen and another belonging to the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine were killed in a "martyrdom operation against the Zionist entity." The fighters, a PRC spokesman said, had intended to enter Nativ Ha'asara. Israel's border fence with the Gaza Strip has rarely been breached since it withdrew soldiers and settlers from the coastal territory in 2005. In Jenin, Israeli army and militant sources identified the Islamic Jihad commander killed in the Israeli raid as Ala Abu Srour. The bystander, wounded in the attack, died later in hospital, officials at the facility said. The army originally reported that troops had shot dead three militants, including Abu Srour, but it later said it could only confirm that he had been killed. Israel says raids against Palestinian militants help to foil attacks against its citizens. Palestinian leaders in the West Bank, where the Fatah movement of President Mahmoud Abbas holds sway, say such operations harm chances for peacemaking. Israel recently stopped pursuing 178 wanted Fatah fighters in the West Bank in a bid to boost Abbas after the Islamist Hamas movement seized control of the Gaza Strip in June. But it has carried on targeting Islamic Jihad, a group that has mounted numerous attacks against Israelis since the start of a Palestinian uprising in 2000. Israeli soldiers crossed into Gaza on Friday and killed two Palestinian gunmen who had opened fire at them, the army said.
