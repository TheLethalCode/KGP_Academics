 KUWAIT, August 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kuwait's Health Minister Massouma al-Mubarak has tendered her resignation after two patients were killed in a hospital fire earlier this week, the official Kuwait news agency KUNA reported on Saturday. The emir of the Gulf Arab state, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, will decide whether to accept or reject the resignation, submitted to the prime minister on Friday, the agency quoted Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammad al-Salem al-Sabah as saying. Several members of parliament have said they want the house to question Mubarak over the fire which broke out at a hospital in the town of al-Jahra about 30 km (20 miles) west of the capital on Thursday. The authorities were investigating the cause of the fire. Mubarak is one of two women ministers in the cabinet. The ministers of oil and transportation resigned in June amid a standoff between the government and parliament over remarks by the oil minister that he had sought advice from a former minister who was once investigated over a graft scandal.
