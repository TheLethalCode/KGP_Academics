Boucher's comments were deemed to have contravened several clauses of CSA's code of conduct, including those dealing with bringing the game into disrepute, and he was summoned to a disciplinary hearing on Aug. 17.

"In the present case the comments to the media were calculated in their effect to embarrass CSA and to denigrate the T20 (Twenty20)." The statement added that CSA had argued at the hearing that Boucher should be banned from playing in the tournament. Boucher has until 1430 GMT on Saturday to lodge an appeal
