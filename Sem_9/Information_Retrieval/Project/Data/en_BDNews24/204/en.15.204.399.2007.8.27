 DHAKA, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) have asked Australia's John Harmer to attend an interview as the country resumes its search for a new coach. The 65-year-old was one of the three candidates shortlisted by the BCB in July after Sri Lanka-born Australian Dav Whatmore declined to renew his contract two months earlier. "Harmer will come to Dhaka shortly to make a presentation before us," BCB official Gazi Ashraf Hossain said on Monday, without giving a date for the interview. The other two names on the shortlist are Australian Jamie Siddons and Zimbabwean Dave Houghton, but plans to have a new coach in place at the beginning of August were held up when the government dissolved the board and formed an interim committee. Australia's Shaun Williams has been in charge of the team on a temporary basis since Whatmore's exit and he will continue to coach the side through next month's Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa
