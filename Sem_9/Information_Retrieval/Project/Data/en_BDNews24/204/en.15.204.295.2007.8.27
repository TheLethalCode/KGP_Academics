 Dhaka, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com) The country should adopt a national strategy to counter terrorism that has become an increasing threat to national life, speakers told a meeting Monday. Some of them described social injustice, inequality, corruption, unemployment and discriminatory education system as the drivers of terrorism. Law adviser Mainul Hosein differed. He said there was no proven cause of terrorism in Bangladesh and urged people to remain vigilant against terrorism coming from other countries. "There is no known, sure and certain cause within the country of terrorism to pose a serious problem. But there is need for us to be vigilant against terrorism coming mainly from outside," Mainul said in his address as chief guest to the launch of a report on "Countering Terrorism in Bangladesh: A Strategy Paper" in Gulshan. Bangladesh Enterprise Institute made the strategy paper for the first time in the country. The paper has analysed causes, nature and extent of terrorism in Bangladesh and suggested some measures to deal with an increasing threat of terrorism. The report says extremist political groups use terrorism as a weapon to gain political control of the polity while the mainstream political parties as a tool for political competition either to gain or to retain political powers. The report further says the recent trend in terrorism in Bangladesh rejects any significant correlation between madrasah education and its links with terrorism. Only 19 percent of those who were arrested for terrorism were from madrasahs, it further says. "Social injustice, poverty, corruption are some of the main causes of terrorism in Bangladesh," former army chief Mahbubur Rahman told the meeting at the BEI conference room. British high commissioner Anwar Choudhury underlined the need for establishing an equitable society to curb terrorism. Farooq Sobhan, president of Bangladesh Enterprise Institute, chaired the launching ceremony, also joined by cabinet secretary Ali Imam Majumder. bdn
