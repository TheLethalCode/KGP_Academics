 BERLIN, August 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Authorities have closed off a poultry farm in southern Germany after an outbreak of bird flu. Local veterinary authorities said late on Friday checks at the farm in the Erlangen-Hoechstadt area in Bavaria had discovered birds infected with the H5N1 virus. A spokeswoman said samples would be examined to determine whether the birds were infected with the deadly strain of H5N1. There was no danger to people in the area, she said. The farm contains around 44,000 birds. Germany identified several cases of the deadly H5N1 strain in wild birds in Bavaria in June. Several bird flu infections were also registered in Germany last year. Earlier this week, Russia banned poultry imports from Italy to prevent the spread of bird flu after outbreaks there.
