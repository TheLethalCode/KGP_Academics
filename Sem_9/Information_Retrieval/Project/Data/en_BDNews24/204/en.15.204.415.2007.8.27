<TEXT>
 PARIS, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraq needs a broad-based government of national unity and France could mediate to help set one up, French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said in a newspaper column on Monday. The International Herald Tribune did not say when he wrote the opinion piece but it was published a day after Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki demanded the French government apologise after Kouchner was quoted as saying Maliki should be replaced. Kouchner, who has just returned from a visit to Iraq, said a withdrawal of foreign troops from the country must be planned. "At the same time, a broad-based government of national unity must be established. France is prepared to act as mediator in this endeavor," he said in the newspaper column. Kouchner said France, which opposed the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq, could provide a fresh look at the country. He also urged Iraq's neighbours to help find a solution to the country's troubles. "Nothing substantial can be done without them. France must help convince them to take part," he said. bd
