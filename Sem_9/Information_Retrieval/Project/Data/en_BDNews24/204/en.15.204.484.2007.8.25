 Dhaka, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com) -- A court Saturday sent two Dhaka University teachers into four-day remand for questioning, about 36 hours after they were arrested. Professor Anwar Hossain and Prof Harun-or-Rashid of Dhaka University are facing charges of having roles in "illegal attacks and property damage," tied to the DU violence. The teachers were taken to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka at 2:20pm. The court also approved a five-day remand for Azizul Bari Helal, president of Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, BNP's student wing. Police arrested Helal Friday at his Maghbazar home in the city, also for links to the DU violence. The joint forces arrested Anwar Hossain, DU Teachers Association general secretary and Harun-or-Rashid, dean of social sciences, late Thursday night. The two teachers were charged under the emergency powers rules. They were accused of instigating the Dhaka University incidents, making provocative statements against the emergency powers rules, and abetting students and others in an attack on the Dhaka University gymnasium. Shahbag police sought a 10-day remand for the pair although the court granted only four days. Supreme Court lawyer Mahbubey Alam represented the two Dhaka University professors with the support of approximately 50 other lawyers. Advocate Sanaullah Miah pleaded for Helal. The police read out the allegations against him and sought a 10-day remand, but the court granted five days. Helal was installed as president of the new JCD leadership, which was revamped by Tarique Rahman, BNP's senior joint secretary general who remains under detention on charges of corruption. Helal faces allegations of creating panic in the public mind and obstructing traffic by setting tyres on fire in front of the Teacher-Student Centre, the vice chancellor's residence and F Rahman Hall. bdnews24
