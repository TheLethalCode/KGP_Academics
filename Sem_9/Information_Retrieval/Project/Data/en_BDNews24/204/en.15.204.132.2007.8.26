 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com) -- Grameenphone's CEO Erik Aas has resigned, effective from October 1ending his three-year stint with the mobile operator. "I will be working for a mobile operator in Indonesia," Erik Aas told bdnews24.com Sunday afternoon in a brief interview in his office, after the news of his resignation spread. "Since Telenor has no business in Indonesia that means I have also resigned from the group," he said without revealing the new employer's name. It means Erik Aas is also ending his 11-year career with Telenor. "The board will appoint my successor and you will know once it is announced," he said. Erik first broke the news of his departure to colleagues at GP by email earlier in the afternoon. "Replies started pouring in and many of them have made me very emotional." He said the employees are Grameenphone's biggest asset. "Their passion to deliver good products shall remain vivid in my memory." Erik Aas had been Grameenphone's board member for two years prior to becoming its CEO in 2004. "I know Bangladesh when GP had only 200,000 customers six years back." The number became two million subscribers when he came from Telenor's Malaysian operation DiGi and took over Grameenphone in October 2004. Since then GP kept exploding with millions of customers and now it boasts a solid 14 million clientele. "We could never afford to reduce the tariff without such growth. We used to cover little over 50 percent of the population at that time and now 98 percent of the population is under our network," said GP's outgoing chief with a note of satisfaction, staring at Dhaka's skyline that is crowded with mobile networks' antennas. He said Grameenphone's investors always had confidence on Bangladesh. "That's why one billion dollars were pumped during the last three years and that is the biggest decision they have ever taken about this market." As a result, Grameenphone fast expanded its operations without compromising quality. Erik Aas believes that the scale of GP's clientele, rather than competition, is the true driver of tariff reduction. "Everybody not necessarily has to make calls. A mother in the village wants a call from her son and there is nothing wrong about it." He said mobile phone strengthens such personal bond and "Grameenphone has recognised the value of it." Erik Aas conservatively estimates that the mobile phone market of Bangladesh will double by 2009. He said the industry should keep the policymakers updated about the market and its trend. Erik Aas was a bachelor when he came to Bangladesh. He is now heading for Indonesia with his Thai wife. They tied the knot in 2006. "Will you be visiting Dhaka?" "I would love to see the scale of progress it makes." He paused, "I am confident about the progress in Bangladesh." bdn
