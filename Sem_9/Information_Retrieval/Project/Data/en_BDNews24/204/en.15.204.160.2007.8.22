<TEXT>
 JERUSALEM, Aug 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UN envoy to the Middle East Michael Williams called on Israel on Wednesday to take more far-reaching steps to bolster Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, warning momentum in bilateral talks could be lost. While Williams said Israel's release of some 250 Palestinian prisoners and transfer of frozen funds to Abbas were "positive signs" following Hamas's takeover of the Gaza Strip in June, he added: "I'm concerned that we haven't seen further steps. I'd like to see further steps." Williams suggested these next steps include easing travel restrictions for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. He also urged Israel to consider removing Jewish outposts and releasing more prisoners.
