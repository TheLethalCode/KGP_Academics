 LONDON, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A woman who was attacked by a gang of youths in a Lancashire park almost two weeks ago has died of her injuries, police said on Friday. Sophie Lancaster, 20, and her boyfriend Robert Maltby, 21, were set upon in Stubby Lee park in Bacup near Burnley in the early hours of Saturday, Aug. 11. Both were beaten unconscious. The Lancashire Telegraph said they were so badly injured that police had difficulty establishing their sex. The paper added that detectives thought they might have been attacked because they were wearing "Gothic clothing". Police said despite attempts to treat Lancaster's injuries she had now died in hospital. They have renewed appeals for information about the assault. "It is tragic that this young woman has now died," said Detective Inspector Dean Holden. "Our thoughts are obviously with her family." Five youths, aged between 15 and 17, have been charged with the assault on Lancaster and Maltby.
