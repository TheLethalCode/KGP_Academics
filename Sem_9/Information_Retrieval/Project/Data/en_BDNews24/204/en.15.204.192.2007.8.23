 Dhaka, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com) -- The Press Information Department Thursday advised all media personnel to use curfew passes during the curfew hours. In a letter signed by the duty officer for the PID newsroom, all print and electronic media personnel were urged to contact the metropolitan police authorities to collect the passes. Since the curfew began at 8pm Wednesday, many journalists have faced interrogation and harassment by law-enforcement officers, while travelling to and from their offices during the curfew hours. A number of journalists have reported that police and army personnel had ignored office ID cards despite the assurances of an earlier PID statement. The PID had earlier said ID cards issued by their own organisations would serve as curfew passes for media personnel. All newspapers, news agencies, radio and television channels were exempted from the curfew, the PID had stated. A long queue for collecting journalists' pass was seen in front of the police control room in Shahbagh Thursday afternoon. bdnews
