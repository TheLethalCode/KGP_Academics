 BAGHDAD, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An indefinite vehicle curfew was imposed on Baghdad from 6:00 p.m. (1400 GMT) on Saturday to maintain security for an upcoming Shi'ite religious event, an Iraqi military spokesman said. Brigadier-General Qassim al-Moussawi said in a statement carried on Iraqi television that the curfew was put in place to protect citizens ahead of a pilgrimage to mark the birth of Imam Muhammad al-Mahdi, which falls early next week.
