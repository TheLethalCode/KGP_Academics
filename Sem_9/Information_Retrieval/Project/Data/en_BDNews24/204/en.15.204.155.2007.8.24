 Dhaka, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com)  A temporary reprieve Friday allowed people to say prayers and do errands, but there was little respite for them in the market with prices soaring by yet another notch. Confined to their houses for 36 hours since Wednesday night, with only a brief three-hour break, people in the six divisional cities of the country rushed to the markets to stock up on essentials. They found market prices had risen higher as the supply chain had been hampered since 8pm Wednesday, when the curfew was clamped. However, many markets exhausted their stocks as buyers piled up on essentials, even at higher prices. Though Friday is a weekend day, many professionals attended to work at offices that have been unattended since Wednesday. Day labourers who usually earn just a daily wage came out of their houses in search of work. The streets were filled with people on private errands or simply relieved to be able to leave their houses for some hours. Public transport was back on the roads. bdnews24.com's Chittagong correspondent reported that small shop owners started opening soon after the curfew was relaxed. Employees of business firms went to offices to catch up on their work. A large number of rickshaws, CNG auto-rickshaws, city and inter-city buses were back on the roads. However, the number of private cars was fewer than normal. Buyers thronged the markets in the port city to stock up on food items and other essentials. However, shopkeepers said they had seen fewer customers than they had expected, fewer even than normal days. bdnews24.com's Rajshahi correspondent reported that the life in the northwestern city returned to near normal after the curfew was relaxed. Traders opened their businesses. Students and visitors to the city who were stranded due to the curfew on Wednesday rushed to the railway station and bus terminals. A visit to Shaheb Bazar at around 10am showed that people were buying up essentials in a hurry. The stocks of vegetables in the markets were exhausted by midday. Many bought vegetables at higher prices without any protest. The crowds at Laxmipur, Station Bazar, Talaimari, New Market Kitchen Market and Shalbagan Bazar eased after midday. Buses ran normally in the day though they started a little late and trains were on time. Limited patrols of army and RAB forces were seen on the roads until midday. bdnews24.com's Barisal correspondent said city dwellers felt some relief with the relaxation of the curfew. People who live hand to mouth and other low-income earners went out in search of work. Almost all shops opened. Vegetable prices were higher in the city kitchen markets as supply dwindled. People bought more essentials than necessary for fear of a prolonged curfew. Traffic movement in the city was normal; some 10,000 rickshaws were on the city streets. Long distance and local buses ran as normal. Motor launches also carried passengers on the shorter internal routes. bdnews24.com/corr/mc
