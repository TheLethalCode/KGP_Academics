 MADRID, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spanish champions Real Madrid have agreed to sign Argentine defender Gabriel Heinze on a four-year deal from Manchester United, the Primera Liga side said on Wednesday. "Real Madrid and Manchester United have reached an agreement for the transfer of Gabriel Heinze," Real said on their Web site (www.realmadrid.com). "The player will join up with his new team immediately." Real did not reveal the fee but Spanish media reported they would pay about 12 million euros ($16.18 million) for the 29-year-old international. Heinze has made it clear he wanted to leave Old Trafford but his attempt to force a move to Liverpool failed when a Premier League arbitration panel refused his request. The defender is the seventh new player to join Real since they sacked Fabio Capello after winning the league title last season. Five of the club's new signings can play in defensive positions, including centre-backs Christoph Metzelder, Pepe, left-sided midfielder/defender Royston Drenthe and goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek. Heinze will compete with Drenthe, Marcelo and Miguel Torres for the left-back berth vacated when Roberto Carlos left the club at the end of the season. COMBATIVE The Argentine, who can also play in the central defence, joined United from Paris St. Germain for 6.9 million pounds ($13.68 million) in 2004 following spells with Sporting Lisbon, Spanish side Valladolid and Newell's Old Boys. Renowned for his combative attitude and determination, he damaged knee ligaments in a Champions League match against Villarreal in September 2005 and missed the rest of the season, although he recovered in time to make the Argentina squad for last year's World Cup. More recently he has found his first-team place threatened by French fullback Patrice Evra who signed for the club in January 2006. At the end of last season he claimed that he had a letter from United giving him permission to move to another club for 6.8 million pounds, a fee Liverpool agreed to pay. But United refused to permit him to join their rivals and the Premier League panel ruled that the letter did not give the go-ahead for his move. Heinze has made some 40 appearances for the Argentine national team and was part of the team that lost to Brazil in the final of the Copa America in July
