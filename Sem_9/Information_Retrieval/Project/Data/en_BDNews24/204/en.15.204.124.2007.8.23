 LONDON, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's exiled former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said on Thursday he intended to return home "as soon as possible" and contest elections to try to oust President Pervez Musharraf from office. "It is the beginning of the end of Musharraf," Sharif told a news conference in London. Asked what role he would play in challenging Musharraf, the army chief who overthrew Sharif's government in a 1999 coup, Sharif was evasive. "Our party is preparing to contest the elections and I am very much part and parcel of my party," he said. "I will be campaigning. I will be leading the campaign." Pakistan's Supreme Court ruled earlier on Thursday that Sharif, 57, could return home after seven years in exile. Sharif, a two-time prime minister, was sentenced to life in prison on various charges after he was overthrown. He and his family first went to Saudi Arabia after the government said he had agreed to 10 years of exile. Sharif denied any such agreement and filed a petition in Pakistan's top court seeking to clear the way for his return. Sharif and Benazir Bhutto, another former prime minister in exile, are both hoping to return to take part in general elections that Musharraf has promised will be free and fair. The timing of a return by Sharif could hardly be more awkward for Musharraf, who is expected to seek re-election from the national and provincial assemblies between mid-September and mid-October and hold parliamentary elections within months.
