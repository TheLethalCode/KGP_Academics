Minu has also been fined Tk 20,500 or has to face an additional five months imprisonment. According to the court record, Minu and his accomplices demanded Tk 4 lakh from funds earmarked for a construction project at Evergreen School and College in Rajshahi. They demanded the money from the contractor, Samsul Alam, on March 29. After failing to secure their extortion demand, Minu and his co-accused looted bricks from the building site worth Tk 25,000.
