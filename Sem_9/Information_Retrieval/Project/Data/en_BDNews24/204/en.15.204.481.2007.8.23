<TITLE> Indian communists adamant about US nuclear deal </TITLE>

 NEW DELHI, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The central committee of India's main communist party said on Thursday it did not want to pull the government down over a nuclear deal with the United States, but added that this depended on the pact not being pursued. The panel's stand came at the end of a two-day meeting called to chart the party's strategy over its opposition to the historic deal, which has triggered Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's worst political crisis since coming to power in 2004. "The central committee does not want the current crisis to affect the government," said a resolution by the central committee of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI(M). "However, this is contingent upon the government not proceeding further with the agreement." "The central committee therefore authorises the politburo to take whatever necessary measures to see that the agreement is not operationalised," it said. Asked if the party would withdraw support to the government, CPI(M) General-Secretary Prakash Karat said: "The responsibility of the future of the government lies with the government." The left has asked the government not to go ahead with negotiations with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) next month to conclude a key safeguards agreement until all its concerns over the deal are addressed. The CPI(M) politburo last week warned the government of "serious consequences" if it went ahead. The four left parties have 60 MPs in the 545-member lower house of parliament and Singh's coalition government would be reduced to a minority and could fall if they end their backing. Earlier on Thursday, India's benchmark share index briefly fell into negative territory on political concerns but then rebounded more than 1 percent in just a few minutes
