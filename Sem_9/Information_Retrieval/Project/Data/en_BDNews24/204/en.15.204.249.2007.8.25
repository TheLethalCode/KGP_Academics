 Dhaka, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com)  Vice captain Mashrafee Bin Mortaza-led green team won against captain Mohammad Ashraful-led red team in both of Saturday's practice matches ahead of the ICC Twenty20 World Cup. After a two- day break due to the curfew, the Bangladesh national cricket team Saturday returned to action with playing Twenty20 matches among themselves at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. The national side on Tuesday and Wednesday played three practice matches and won all the matches against the national academy team, who left home for Australia Thursday to play five one-dayers and one three-dayer and four-dayer each. In the day's first match, the green side handed a five-wicket defeat to the red team, who also conceded a slim three-run defeat to the same rivals in the second match. Chasing a target of 134 to win set by the red side, the green side reached home scoring 137 losing five wickets in 18.1 overs with uncapped pacer Ziaur Rahman scoring a blazing 29-ball 48 containing four sixes and one four. In the second match, the Ashraful side were 137 for nine in 20 overs chasing a winning target of 141 set by the Mashrafee side. Ashraful, making eight runs in the first match, scored a 36-ball 30 runs with only one boundary in the second match. Except Mahmudullah Raid, no batsman could show any firework in terms of the attitude in a Twenty20 match, and both matches saw the total at below the 150-mark. Mahmuddullah, a player of green team, remained unbeaten on 39 off 35 featuring two sixes and one four in the second match after scoring a 26-ball 33 not out in the first match. Uncapped Nazimuddin, a player of green team, also showed his worth hitting 41 off 35 balls clubbing three sixes and one four, and Alok Kapali, a player of red team, scored 42 and 23 in the first and second matches. "We had a good practice today (Saturday), though our side went down on both occasions," national captain Ashraful told reporters after the match. He said that his side was decked up with most batsmen while the opponents consisted the genuine bowlers. "We, by and large, started well, but the tail-enders couldn't click as expected, so the total didn't get a healthy-shape," Ashraful said, "I, however, expect that each player of the 15-member squad will get back their form in the remaining matches before going to Kenya for the world cup warm-up tournament involving Kenya, Uganda, Pakistan and Bangladesh."
