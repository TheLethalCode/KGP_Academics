<TEXT>
 OSAKA, Japan, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The world governing body for athletics (IAAF) called on the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) on Thursday to adopt stronger penalties for doping, including a four-year ban for serious first-time violations. "We remain convinced that strong penalties are an important cornerstone of an effective anti-doping campaign in general, and in athletics in particular," the International Association of Athletics Federations Congress said in a statement. WADA currently has a two-year penalty for serious violations by initial offenders. The agency is reviewing its anti-doping code and will adopt a revised one in November. It is unlikely to approve the changes sought by the IAAF
