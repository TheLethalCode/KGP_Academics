 MADRID, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid got their title defence off to a winning start when a deflected shot by new signing Wesley Sneijder earned a 2-1 comeback victory over city rivals Atletico at the Bernabeu on Saturday. The Dutchman's miscued shot spun off a defender and ended up in the back of the net after Guti had rolled a free kick into his path 10 minutes from time. The game between the Primera Liga's two biggest spenders was played at a frenetic pace with the sides playing open, attacking football. But Bernd Schuster's Real looked more dangerous in front of goal and deserved the win. "We made a huge effort for this first game and it was an exciting match which the fans clearly enjoyed," said coach Schuster. "We got the win tonight but Atletico are a very dangerous side and I think they will be battling away with the top teams this season." Sevilla, who beat Real 5-3 in the Super Cup last week, continued their sparkling start to the season with a 4-1 comeback win over Getafe thanks to second-half goals from Jesus Navas, Luis Fabiano, Frederic Kanoute and Alexander Kerzhakov. Michael Laudrup's Getafe went in front after two minutes but the visitors fell apart after having Francisco Sousa and David Cortes sent off in the first half. Real Murcia notched a 2-1 triumph over Real Zaragoza on their return to the top flight, new signing Fernando Baiano grabbing the winner for the hosts. FLYING START Atletico made a flying start at the Bernabeu, Argentine youngster Sergio Aguero putting the visitors ahead inside a minute when he stole in at the far post to nod in a Mariano Pernia corner. Real responded well and Robinho was denied in the 14th minute when Atletico keeper Leo Franco saved his fierce shot. A minute later Raul equalised when he steered a neat header past Franco after Sergio Ramos had floated in a cross from the right. There was no let-up in the pace in a breathless opening half hour, Robinho going close for Real after a lightning break and Maxi Rodriguez clipping the ball wide after a well-worked Atletico attack. But it was Real who carried more threat up front, Ramos heading against the post on the half hour and Sneijder firing wide from long range. Real midfielder Mahamadou Diarra missed the best chance of the first half when he sliced wide with the goal at his mercy. Atletico made a bright start to the second period but faded as Real grew in confidence, Guti firing a free kick against the bar and Ruud van Nistelrooy having a close-range shot blocked by Franco
