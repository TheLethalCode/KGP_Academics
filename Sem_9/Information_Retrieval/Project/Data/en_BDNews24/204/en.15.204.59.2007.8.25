<TITLE> British TV network axes Celebrity Big Brother 2008 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- Britain's Channel 4 said Friday it has scrapped next year's "Celebrity Big Brother," one of its most popular shows, in sweeping changes to its primetime schedule after being accused of "dumbing down" its content. Director of Television Kevin Lygo said all but one of the programs currently shown at 9 p.m. will disappear from the 2008 line-up to clear the decks for new shows. "It is time to be brutal with some much-loved shows in order, once again, to make way for the new," he said in a statement. "Our ratings will almost certainly continue to fall, but the alternative is more of the same and that is not what the channel is about." Channel 4, which has been accused of "dumbing down" its content, has faced intense speculation over its future, with some reports suggesting the government may sell it. It was forced to apologies after a race row engulfed this year's Celebrity Big Brother and has been caught up in the recent scandal over TV phone-in competitions. Thousands of viewers complained after Indian actress Shilpa Shetty was repeatedly abused by fellow housemates. The show has previously given viewers the sight of Vanessa Feltz cracking up, George Galloway pretending to be a cat and Germaine Greer walking out over the producers' "bullying." Channel 4's Head of Programs Julian Bellamy said the decision to drop Celebrity Big Brother would make room for 29 hours of new programmes. It will cut its 2008 budget for American television series by 10 million pounds. "These are the decisions of a public service broadcaster in search of the new and the exciting," Bellamy said.
