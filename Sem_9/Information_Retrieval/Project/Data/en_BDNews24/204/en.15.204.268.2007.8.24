<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com)  A good number of officials and employees went to work at public offices including Bangladesh Secretariat Thursday morning as there had not been a directive the previous night on whether the offices would remain closed during curfew. Some claim they faced harassment at the hands of law enforcers on the way to and from work. Establishment secretary Abdus Salam Khan in a circular issued at 9.30am had announced the closure of government and semi-government offices, autonomous bodies and all educational institutions in the six divisional cities during the indefinite curfew. Following the statement, those who had made it to work earlier in the morning trudged back home. The secretariat building was empty by 10:30am, except for secretaries of three ministries, staff at the Press Information Department under the information ministry and those in charge of security at the secretariat. Security agency personnel present at the secretariat told bdnews24.com about 25 percent of the officials and employees arrived at work by 9.30am. Other staff had received news of the closure of offices from media sources before leaving their homes. Nasimul Alam, a secretariat employee returning home Thursday morning after turning up to his office, said he did not receive prior notice from the government about the closure. "We had to come to office facing severe difficulties and had to return home amid an equally unfriendly situation in a curfew," he said. Alam added he and his co-workers would not have faced such difficulties had the government informed them beforehand about the holiday. Azizul Haque, a personal staffer at the establishment ministry, says he was assaulted and seriously injured him at about 9:15am by RAB personnel on the way to work in Central Shahid Minar area. He was given first aid for his injuries at the secretariat clinic where he spoke to reporters and later transferred to the government employees' hospital. He told reporters as he had got no word about the closure of government offices during the curfew, he was going to his secretariat office in the morning from his Azimpur home. Officials and employees present at the secretariat were upset when they realised they had needlessly faced dangers and harassment on the street to make their way to work. They went to demand an explanation from the establishment secretary and calmed down only after the secretary assured them of some remedy. bdnews24.
