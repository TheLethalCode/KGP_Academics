<TITLE> Waiting for the "dogs to bark" the night Diana died </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - It was just after midnight when my home telephone rang. A colleague working the overnight shift at Reuters apologised for waking me up. "There has been a crash in Paris and the police are pretty sure Diana was in the car," he said. It was the start of a surreal night and probably the most stressful week of my working life. Princess Diana's death was to sweep other stories off the front page, and many inside pages, of newspapers around the world. Only the hardest of hearts was left unmoved by its impact on her family, particularly her two boys, and millions of people mourned her as one of their own, whatever their reasons. On my way to the London office, the radio was reporting Diana's boyfriend, Dodi al-Fayed, had died in the crash in an underpass but there was no news on her condition. The world's media had been tracking Diana and her love interest for days, splashing photographs of the pair cavorting in the Mediterranean and speculating about whether the son of Harrods owner Mohamed al-Fayed would be her second husband. I rang Buckingham Palace, Kensington Palace and Prime Minister Tony Blair's office for news about Diana. No one answered. This was extremely unusual. As every British television channel began reporting live from Paris and London, there was a report that Diana had been seen at the entrance of the tunnel in Paris, wearing a sling. I relaxed a little but not for long. One of our reporters was travelling with Robin Cook, foreign minister since Blair had won power in a May election, on a swing through Asia. At about 3 a.m. London time the reporter rang in from the tarmac of Manila airport. "Take your fingers off the keyboard before I speak to you, Robert," he began. (I had a reputation for getting excitable when big news broke.) He said Cook's flight had been stopped on the runway and the correspondents with him had been briefed. "I've been told to tell you to expect the worst," he said. The reporter, David Ljunggren, faced a journalistic dilemma over what could have been the biggest scoop of his life. Reporters had noticed a huddle at the back of the plane and found Cook's chief spokesman looking shattered. "She's dead," he said. "Pardon?" asked someone. "Princess Diana is dead," he said. "Can we use that?" he was asked. The spokesman said he could not be quoted in any form because the French authorities had to announce the news. David and I discussed whether we could use this information -- off the record means just that, it cannot be used in a story. Anyway were we confident that Cook's press spokesman, several thousand miles from the accident, knew the truth. Was he swept up in the percolating reports and rumours on her fate? We decided to hold off but, 10 years later, we still discuss whether that was the right decision. When Diana's car was slowly hauled out of the tunnel into the sight of television cameras we knew from the severe damage that she would have suffered terrible injuries. I was starting to feel dizzy because I had eaten little for 10 hours. I needed reinforcements but it was a national holiday weekend at the end of summer. I rang up mobiles, partners, parents and flat mates of colleagues but could reach no one. Thankfully, the European news editor arrived to back me up. Several months earlier a couple of our reporters had gone for lunch with a royal functionary and had extracted the mobile number of someone high up at Buckingham Palace. We had agreed that this number would be used only in a dire emergency. I rang it and the phone was not picked up. "None of the dogs are barking," said the news editor. "I'm sure she's dead." The announcement came 30 minutes later and I sent the flash on the death of the most recognised woman in the wor
