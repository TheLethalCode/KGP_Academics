 Dhaka, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com)  Law and information adviser Mainul Hosein Monday said the incident at the University of Dhaka was created with a political motive to put the government face to face with the army. He made the comment at a meeting with news editors of electronic media at the conference room of information ministry. "We have successfully overcome the problem," he said and added investigations had brought the facts about the incidents to surface. Mainul said filing cases against many people would not be necessary, everything would come out if cases were filed against a few people. "The political government had quit leaving the country in a critical condition," the adviser said and added the emergency government had saved the country from civil war and restored peace and discipline. "We have started trial of the corrupt persons. Their trial is a must. Otherwise, the country will not get any honest government in future." "After taking over power, the government has taken initiatives to separate the judiciary, hold a fair election, make arrangements for the honest people to participate in the elections and execute laws for transparency in funding of the political parties," he said. "The government is not working only for electoral roadmap it is also working for the roadmap to democracy. The political government completely destroyed democracy in the country." "The present government is working for rescuing democracy," Mainul said. Renewing the commitment that the elections will be held by 2008, he said, "We want to hand over the responsibility to an elected government." "The government has an exit strategy. As soon as the democracy will be established, we will leave," he said. The information adviser observed the journalists were a part of the government. "Both the government and the journalists have to work hand in hand." He said journalists would no more be harassed in discharging their duties.
