<TEXT>
 Savar, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com) - Election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain Saturday alleged that 35 NGOs, under the banner of Election Working Group, have been embezzling crores of taka received from abroad. He said the NGOs were bringing the money from abroad in the name of election-related purposes. "We had an agreement that they would use the money for election work, but they are not doing it. They only talk big," Sakhawat said. He was speaking at a meeting at the Savar Municipal Auditorium where he visited a centre for preparing a voter list with photographs and national ID cards. Sakhawat said the work of preparing the final voter list with photographs and national ID cards started in Rajshahi on August 11. "Now the work is continuing in Rajshahi and Khulna city corporations and 13 municipalities," he said. "We are trying to go to the people. Earlier voter lists were prepared in a bureaucratic way. As per the new system, one person can become a voter from only one place." He repeated that the Election Commission would sit in a dialogue with political parties on election law reforms in September. "Permission for wall writing (graffiti), putting up posters, arches, using loudspeakers and setting up offices will be given before the election." He hoped the Election Commission would hold elections on a flawless voter list by 2008. Election commissioner Sohul Hossain, who was present at the meeting, said there would be no fraud when a voter list with photographs was prepared. "We have discussed the issues with eminent citizens, editors and journalists. Any type of fraud in election must be stopped. All have to be motivated to sign up as voters," he said. bdnews24.c
