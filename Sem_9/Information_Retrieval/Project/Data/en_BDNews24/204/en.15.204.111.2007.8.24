<TITLE> Bangladesh face Zimbabwe Saturday </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh's second- string football team will certainly want a point against Zimbabwe when they square off in the Merdeka Cup Group B last match at Shah Alam Stadium in Kuala Lumpur Saturday. After losing to Indonesia 1-0 and Singapore 2-1 in the first two matches, winless Bangladesh failed to confirm the semifinal berth remaining at the bottom of the group table and they will desperately want to return home with a point instead of empty hands. However, there is no doubt that Zimbabwe, FIFA ranking 101, will be the superior side against Bangladesh, FIFA ranking 176, in Saturday's match. It is to be seen how the young footballers of Bangladesh play in their first-ever battle against the African nation.
