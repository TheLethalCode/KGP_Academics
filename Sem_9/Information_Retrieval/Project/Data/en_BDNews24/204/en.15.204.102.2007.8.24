 LONDON, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif vowed on Thursday to return from exile in the coming days and fight to end President Pervez Musharraf's rule. Sharif, who was overthrown by Musharraf, then chief of army staff, in 1999, also had harsh words for the United States, saying its support for Musharraf was not consistent with its avowed principle of promoting democracy. "I want the United States to support democracy and not a man who is holding a gun in his hand," he told Reuters in an interview. "Why is it supporting uniformed tyranny in Pakistan?" The United States sees Pakistan as a vital ally in its battle against al Qaeda militants in Afghanistan, although it has also expressed frustration with Musharraf's rule. The Supreme Court in Islamabad ruled on Thursday that Sharif, 57, who was allowed to go into exile in 2000 after being convicted of corruption, and of hijacking for refusing landing rights to a jet carrying Musharraf, could return home. Sharif said he would lead election campaigning for his party, the Pakistan Muslim League, and gave strong signals that he would stand for office again. "If the people of Pakistan want me to serve the country, it would be a pleasure for me to accept that role," he said, speaking after a press conference in London. "Even if there are risks, one will have to accept them, because I owe it to my people. I have a duty to perform and I will do it at any cost." Musharraf is expected to seek re-election from the national and provincial assemblies between mid-September and mid-October, and to hold a parliamentary election within months. Sharif's verdict on Musharraf's rule was staunchly negative. "Musharraf's eight years are a symbol of tyranny," he said. "He is guilty of subverting the constitution of Pakistan. All his nefarious designs have to be defeated." Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry ruled that Sharif and his brother, Shahbaz, who is also a politician and was exiled with his brother in 2000, had an "inalienable right" to come back and stay in Pakistan. Sharif said the Supreme Court's decision was final and he would not seek any assurances from Musharraf that his personal safety would be protected. "I do not talk to dictators," he said. "There cannot be any quid pro quo with dictators." He called it "disturbing" that Benazir Bhutto, another exiled former prime minister, had seemingly cut a deal with the embattled Musharraf when she met him in Abu Dhabi last month. Bhutto is also hoping to return for a general election. Asked if he believed Musharraf's promise of a free and fair vote, Sharif said: "That is what we will have to struggle for. Musharraf is not going to present it to us on a platte
