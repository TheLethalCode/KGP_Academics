<TITLE> Gay's coach to leave prison as 200m bid starts </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 OSAKA, Japan, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - As new 100 metres world champion Tyson Gay begins his quest for the 200 title, Tuesday will also be a red letter day for his coach. Lance Brauman will be released from a federal prison in Texarkana, Texas, where he has spent more than nine months after being found guilty of embezzlement, theft and mail fraud charges in 2006. "He's not 'home' yet, but it's the next best thing," Brauman's wife, Kim, told Sports Illustrated. Brauman will spend the next month in a halfway house in Orlando, Florida. "He will have more phone calls and internet access during the worlds so it will make communication between him and his athletes a little easier," she said. Brauman missed Gay's 100 metres showdown with world record holder Asafa Powell on Sunday, but will be his hands-on mentor in the run-up to an even bigger event -- the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Gay's workouts were communicated in phone calls to Brauman and training sessions prepared before his coach entered prison. The two men spoke before the 100 metres final. "He told me he knew when he woke up I would be the world champion," Gay said. "I dedicate this victory to him." Gay believes Brauman's situation has helped him become a better athlete. "The coaching situation basically matured me a lot," Gay said. "It allowed me to learn how to train diligently in the absence of my coach. I think that made me become a better man." Gay is due to run two rounds of the 200 metres on Tuesday, with the semi-finals scheduled for Wednesday and the final on Thursday. He is heavily favoured to win a second gold but remains cautious. "I think it is harder to have success then come back and run another race than it is to run one race," Gay said
