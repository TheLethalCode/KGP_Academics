<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Attorney General Alberto Gonzales resigned on Monday, ending a controversial tenure as chief US law enforcement officer that blemished the administration of President George W Bush. Gonzales announced at the Justice Department that his resignation would take effect on Sept 17. He refused to take questions from reporters and gave no reason for his sudden decision to depart after months of controversy. "I have lived the American dream," said Gonzales, a son of migrant workers who began working for Bush when the president was still the governor of Texas. "Even my worst days as attorney general have been better than my father's best days," he said. Bush was expected to make a statement later Monday, but a senior administration official said the president had not decided on a new nominee. U.S. Solicitor General Paul Clement will serve as acting attorney general, the official said, amid speculation that Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff could be a candidate for a permanent replacement. A 52-year-old Bush loyalist, Gonzales was at the center of a political firestorm over the sacking of federal prosecutors last year, which critics in Congress said were politically motivated. He faced a possible perjury investigation for his testimony before Congress. Gonzales spoke to Bush by telephone on Friday and then visited him on Sunday at his Crawford ranch, where he formally submitted his letter of resignation, said another senior administration official. "He (Bush) very reluctantly accepted it," the official said. Asked whether anyone from the White House had suggested that Gonzales resign, the official said: "It was his decision." Reaction from Democrats was swift. Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, blamed Gonzales and Bush for "a severe crisis of leadership" at the Justice Department. "I hope the attorney general's decision will be a step toward getting to the truth about the level of political influence this White House wields over the Department of Justice and toward reconstituting its leadership," he said in a statement. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said: "This resignation is not the end of the story. Congress must get to the bottom of this mess and follow the facts where they lead, into the White House." Gonzales is the latest member of Bush's inner circle to leave the White House as the administration heads toward the final year of its two-term reign. Top Bush adviser Karl Rove departed last week, following former communications director Dan Bartlett earlier this year. Gonzales worked for Bush when he was governor of Texas in the 1990s. He served as White House lawyer in Bush's first term as president before becoming the first Hispanic attorney general in February 2005. Current and former administration officials had said the department's integrity had been damaged under Gonzales with controversy over the firing of the prosecutors, his support for Bush's warrantless domestic spying program adopted after the Sept. 11 attacks and other issues. Before becoming the chief U.S. law enforcement official, Gonzales drew fire from critics of U.S. interrogation policy for writing in January 2002 that parts of the Geneva Convention on the treatment of prisoners of war were "obsolete" and some provisions "quaint." Officials complained that employee morale at the Justice Department had been hurt during Gonzales' tenure and that the attorney general's relations with the Democrats and some Republicans in Congress had deteriorated beyond repair. While acknowledging mistakes in the handling of the dismissals, Gonzales had denied the firings were politically motivated to influence federal probes involving Democratic or Republican lawmakers. Bush has defended Gonzales and cited Gonzales' rise as an achievement for Hispanics, the largest minority in the United States. "I haven't seen Congress say he's done anything wrong," Bush said at a recent news conference. "As a matter of fact, I believe we're watching ... a political exercis
