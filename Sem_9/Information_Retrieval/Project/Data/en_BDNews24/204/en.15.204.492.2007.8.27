Olmert will meet Abbas to try move forward issues between Israel and the Palestinian Authority and the two leaders will try to build on matters discussed in previous meetings, the official said. Senior Abbas aide Saeb Erekat said the date of the meeting was not yet definite. "We are still preparing for the meeting and we hope that it will take place very soon," Erekat said.
