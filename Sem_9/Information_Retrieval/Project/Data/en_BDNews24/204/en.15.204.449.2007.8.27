 Dhaka, August 26 (bdnews24.com)The general students and teachers of Dhaka University have no connections with those involved in the countrywide violence that started after the DU incident, DUTA said in a statement Sunday. The Dhaka University Teachers Association said it was unfortunate that members of the security forces punished students who remained on campus during the curfew period. "Evil forces created disorder by resorting to vandalism and arson at an unimaginably quick speed in Dhaka and elsewhere," the statement said. The teachers' association asked the government to follow proper legal procedures with Prof Anwar Hossain and Prof Harun-or-Rashid, the DU teachers who were arrested by joint forces on Aug 24, and to treat them with due respect in remand. The statement, signed by DUTA president Prof Sadrul Amin and acting general secretary Dr Mamun Ahmed, urged all to remain calm and behave responsibly, so that academic activities could begin again as soon as possible. bdnews
