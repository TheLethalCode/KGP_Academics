 OSAKA, Japan, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jamaica's world record holder Asafa Powell and American Tyson Gay cruised through their 100 metres heats at the world championships on Saturday. Powell burst quickly from the blocks before slowing down dramatically after 60 metres to finish second in his heat in 10.34 seconds on the opening day of competition in Osaka. Gay clocked 10.19 behind Japan's Nobuharu Asahara and stuck to his assessment that the world record of 9.77 could fall in Sunday's final. "I tried to run 10.3 but the track wouldn't allow me to do it," Gay told reporters. "I'm really looking forward to this evening and tomorrow." Gay ran this season's fastest time of 9.84 at the U.S. championships and predicted fireworks when he should meet Powell for the first time this year. "It's the fastest track I've ever been on," Gay said. "I just couldn't really run slow -- it was kind of hard!" American team mate J-Mee Samuels endorsed Gay's view. "It's a perfect track and perfect conditions," said Samuels after squeezing through in his heat. "Anything's possible on this track." Powell was less demonstrative after a conservative run in which he trailed Keston Bledman of Trinidad and Tobago, sticking both thumbs up when asked how fast the track was. Neither of the two red-hot favourites for gold has won a world title, Powell missing the 2005 championships in Helsinki through injury and Gay finishing fourth in the 200 metres. There was a shock for Portugal's Francis Obikwelu, however, when the Athens Olympic silver medallist was disqualified for jumping the gun in his heat. Britain's Marlon Devonish topped the morning timesheets, clocking 10.13 in heat three. The men's 100m quarter-finals take place in Saturday's evening session with the semi-finals and showpiece final on Sunday
