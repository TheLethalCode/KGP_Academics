Also, the detained former prime minister has to turn in her wealth statement to the Anticorruption Commission in seven days, the Appellate Division of the apex court said in a third order. The appeals court stayed High Court bail orders in two extortion cases against Hasina, who was arrested on July 16. The court put freezes on another HC stay order on the ACC notice served on Hasina, asking her to submit a wealth statement. The Supreme Court asked Hasina to submit her wealth statement to ACC in seven days. The Appellate Division orders will remain effective until disposal of Hasina's writ appeals in the High Court.
