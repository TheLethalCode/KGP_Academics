<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 22 (bdnews24.com)Law and information adviser Mainul Hosein has advised the media to follow strictly the 'instructions' for the press framed under the emergency powers rules. "We don't want to impose censorship on the press although some emergency powers rules have authorised the government to impose censorship on the media," Mainul told journalists Wednesday at a press briefing at the information ministry. "I hope that the media will keep it in mind and abide by the rules," he said. Editors of some leading newspapers were present at the briefing. "We want to maintain our confidence in the media," the adviser said. Mainul read out part of the Emergency Powers Ordinance, which restricts the media from publishing or airing some news items on 'sensitive issues'. He claimed that the people were with the caretaker government. "Therefore, we don't want to impose any restriction [on media]. But it doesn't mean that we won't impose restrictions if something goes against [national] interests." The journalists attending the press briefing alleged that intelligence agencies were making telephone calls to the media houses and instructing them to serve news items as per their dictation. bdnews24.co
