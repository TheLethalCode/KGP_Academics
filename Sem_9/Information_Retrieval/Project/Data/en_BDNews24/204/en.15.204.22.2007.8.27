 WASHINGTON, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States on Sunday condemned weekend bombings in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad that have left at least 40 people dead and about 80 wounded. Two bombs packed with metal pellets exploded within minutes of each other late on Saturday at separate locations in the city -- a food center and an amusement park -- and one official said more bombs were later discovered unexploded. Indian officials suspect Islamist militants from Pakistan or Bangladesh could be responsible for the attacks. "We condemn the attacks that occurred in Hyderabad," US State Department spokesman Tom Casey said in a statement issued on Sunday in Washington. "Our hearts and prayers are with the people of India. There is no justification for harming and killing innocent people. India has shown great resolve and courage in the face of extremist threats. We continue to stand by the Indian people in the fight against terror," the US statement said. Indian intelligence officials have warned in recent months that Islamist militants have turned their attention to India's southern region, with its booming cities like Hyderabad -- an IT hub with a history of Hindu-Muslim tensions. In May, 11 Muslim worshippers were killed and five shot in subsequent clashes with police after a mosque bombing in Hyderabad
