<TEXT>
 OSAKA, Japan, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jamaica's Veronica Campbell won the 100 metres title following a blanket finish to the final and chaotic scenes at the world championships on Monday. Campbell and American defending champion Lauryn Williams were both given the same time of 11.01 seconds and the judges took several minutes to decide the Jamaican had won the race. With the first six finishers separated by just seven hundredths of a second, 2003 world champion Torri Edwards was initially flashed up on the stadium's big screen as the winner. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd and perplexed looks on the faces of the athletes told a different story, however, and that was confirmed when Campbell was awarded the gold medal. Williams took the silver and her compatriot Carmelita Jeter bronze in a time of 11.02. Edwards was fourth in 11.05. Campbell's winning time was the slowest for the event in world championships history
