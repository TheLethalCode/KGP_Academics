<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League acting president Zillur Rahman Saturday criticised the arrest of five university teachers and asked the government to free them immediately. "I don't think it was necessary to arrest them. If the government fails to show tolerance, the result won't be good," the AL leader told reporters at his Gulshan home. "Nothing is better than tolerance in politics," he said, adding that the matter of taking them on remand is "very sad". The former LGRD minister also disputed a government claim that the political parties were involved in recent violent incidents on the Dhaka University campus. "It's unfortunate that the government is trying to involve the political parties in the incidents," he said. He, however, offered his party's support to help end the crisis. "We want the government to sit with the political parties for a discussion. A solution will come from the discussion. The Awami League is ready for this," he said. Referring to the cases against his party chief Sheikh Hasina, the senior leader once again termed the charges "baseless". "We are hopeful of getting justice," he said, adding the court comes in front when the nation is in crisis. A Dhaka court Saturday allowed the security agents to interrogate two Dhaka University teachers for four days. The joint forces arrested the teachers, Prof Anwar Hossain and Prof Harun-or-Rashid, late Thursday in separate raids on their university homes. The families and the DU authorities had earlier said they had no clue about their whereabouts after arrest. Acting DU vice chancellor AFM Yusuf Haider Saturday asked the government to be cautious in dealing with his colleagues' issues. Meanwhile, a Rajshahi court Saturday approved a police appeal to take three teachers of Rajshahi University into 10-day remand. bdnews24.c
