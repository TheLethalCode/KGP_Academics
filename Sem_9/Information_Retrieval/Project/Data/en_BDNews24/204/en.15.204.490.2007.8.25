<TEXT>
 ISLAMABAD, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan successfully tested a new air-launched cruise missile with stealth design on Saturday, the military said in a statement. The missile, named Hatf-8 (Ra'ad), has a range of 350 kms (220 miles) and can carry all types of warheads, the military said. "The missile has a low detection probability due to stealth design and materials," it said. The military said the missile would give its aircraft "a strategic stand-off capability on land and at sea". The test came a month after Pakistan tested the nuclear-capable Babur Hatf VII cruise missile, which has a range of 700 km (435 miles). The Babur was first tested in 2005. The Ra'ad - which means thunder in Arabic - has an accuracy comparable to the Babur missile, the military said. President Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz congratulated the scientists and engineers involved in the development of the new missile. "Pakistan's defence will continue to be strengthened as an imperative of national security," the military quoted the two leaders as saying. Nuclear-armed rivals Pakistan and India routinely carry out missile tests despite a peace process they launched in early 2004. The neighbours carried out nuclear weapons tests in 1998.
