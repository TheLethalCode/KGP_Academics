<TEXT>
 MADRID, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Argentine defender Gabriel Heinze said he did not believe Real Madrid would be his final destination after trying to force his way out of Manchester United to join their Premiership rivals Liverpool. "I never thought this would be where I would end up, but I'm very happy," the 29-year-old Argentine told a news conference after completing a 12-million euro move to the Spanish champions. Heinze, who made 83 appearances for United, had made it clear he wanted to leave Old Trafford at the end of last season but his attempt to force a move to Liverpool failed when a Premier League arbitration panel refused his request. Both Olympique Lyon and Real expressed an interest in signing the defender, but he said he had opted to sign a four-year deal with the Spanish side because of their name. "I have great respect for Lyon, but I decided on Real because every player wants to come to this team and I think I made the right choice," he said. Asked if he left the club on bad terms he replied: "I did what I felt was necessary and the Manchester fans aren't stupid so they won't forget what I did for the club." LEAGUE CHAMPION "I left as league champion and as for the manager's reaction, you will have to ask (Alex) Ferguson if he is upset by what I've done." Heinze, who played in Spain for Valladolid before moving to Paris St. Germain in 1999, has been signed by Real as a substitute for long-serving left back Roberto Carlos who left the club for Fenerbahce last season. But the Argentine said he had not come to the Bernabeu with the idea of replacing the Brazilian. "It is impossible to forget what Roberto Carlos did at Real Madrid and I'm not here to do that. I'm here to do my job and give everything I can to this club." Heinze said he was unsure if he would be available to play in Real's first game of the season against city rivals Atletico Madrid. "Two weeks ago I came back from holiday but because of personal problems I didn't train with Manchester United and so I can't tell you what sort of condition I was in. I'll know after training tonight if I'm in the right sort of shape.
