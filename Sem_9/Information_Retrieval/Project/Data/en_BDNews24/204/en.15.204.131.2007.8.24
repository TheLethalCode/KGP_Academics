<TITLE> Anti-foreigner campaign adds edge to Swiss vote </TITLE>

 By Tom Armitage BERNE, Switzerland, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Switzerland's most popular political party has added a hard edge to the campaign for a parliamentary election in October with a controversial initiative to extradite foreigners who commit serious crimes. The right-wing Swiss People's Party (SVP/UDC), which won over a quarter of the vote in the 2003 parliamentary election, has plastered towns and cities with cartoon-like posters calling for the "black sheep" in Swiss society to be booted out. The party is seeking 100,000 signatures in support of the so-called "Extradition Initiative", enough to force the issue to a national referendum. However, the posters and flyers sent to 4 million Swiss homes are also likely to influence October's vote. The posters feature three white sheep standing on territory marked by a Swiss flag, one of which is kicking a black sheep off, with the slogan: "Creating security" (www.svp.ch). The SVP has in the past campaigned against bogus asylum seekers and warned of the "Muslimisation" of Switzerland. Its campaign for the 2003 election was criticised by the United Nations' refugee agency for its racist overtones, and the latest campaign has also ruffled official feathers. "Hopefully civil society will react against this poster campaign in their voting so that this becomes an own goal for the SVP and reveals their bad side," said Georg Kreis, president of the government-backed Federal Commission against Racism. The city of Geneva, in the French-speaking west where the SVP is hoping to pick up votes on Oct. 21, issued an unusually strong condemnation of the posters this week. "The city council strongly disapproves of the simplistic argumentation, which conveys an image likely to generate intolerance and exclusion," it said in a statement. Smarting from an arson attack on a synagogue in the city, Geneva stressed its commitment to cultural diversity. Switzerland's reputation for tolerance has also recently been dented by a campaign against minarets and by neo-Nazi activity. The SVP the biggest party in Switzerland by share of the popular vote -- denies its campaign is xenophobic. "Other foreigners who follow the law and behave well are welcome," SVP spokesman Roman Jaeggi said. According to Jaeggi, the campaign has been welcomed by many foreigners living in Switzerland who do not wish to be associated with "those who don't abide by the rules". Anti-racism campaigners say the posters reflect a trend among Europe's more extreme right-wing political parties of drawing links between immigration and crime. "Where is the sociological evidence that foreigners commit more crimes?" asked Liz Fereke of a British-based charity, the Institute for Race Relations (IRR). In Switzerland, foreigners are indeed over-represented in official crime statistics, although that may result from the fact that more foreigners than Swiss tend to be poor, and that a greater proportion are at the peak criminal age of 18 to 35. Immigration and asylum have long been grist for Europe's right-wing parties such as the Front National in France, Belgium's Vlaams Belang or the Austrian Freedom Party (FPOe). Fereke said European voters, even those on the right, are increasingly comfortable with asylum seekers. However, since Sept. 11, terrorism and security have become potent buzzwords, even in neutral Switzerland where terrorist threats are low. "There is a renewed emphasis on foreigners and criminality," said Fereke. "After 9/11 it's easy to play on fears that foreigners undermine security because they might be terrorists." The SVP believes the campaign will help raise its profile ahead of the national election. The party is seeking to hold on to territory in the German-speaking regions around Zurich and Berne, and to increase its share of the vote in the western, French-speaking regions, where it is known as the UDC. "The SVP want to increase their share of the vote and they are very good at marketing," said Elsbeth Steiner, a spokeswoman for the Swiss Federal Commission for Foreigners. "The SVP know that when they campaign for referendums on issues such as asylum and foreigners they will get 40, 50 or even 60 percent of the vote." The SVP's share of the vote in national elections has risen in recent years from fourth to first under the pugnacious leadership of the wealthy industrialist Christoph Blocher. Blocher, who is now justice minister in the multi-party cabinet, has been a spokesman for many of the SVP's campaigns, appealing to middle-class, conservative voters with his anti-European Union, isolationist message. The collegiate nature of Swiss politics, where parties rarely criticise one another or campaign negatively, means that they are unlikely to challenge the SVP's campaign head-on. "Racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism are more openly expressed in a direct democracy than they are in an indirect democracy," said Kreis. "One has to live with it."
