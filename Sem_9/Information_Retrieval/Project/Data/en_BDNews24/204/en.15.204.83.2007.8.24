 Dhaka, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh ended their Nehru Cup campaign Friday with a 3-0 drubbing by Kyrgyzstan in their last group match at Ambedkar Stadium in New Delhi. From four matches, Bangladesh under Indian coach Syed Nayeemuddin secured only one point thanks to a 1-1 draw against Cambodia. The footballers lost to Syria 2-0 and India 1-0 in the first two matches. Kyrgyzstan, a 153rd in FIFA ranking, enjoyed a superior ball possession in the first half over Bangladesh, 176 in the game's governing body ranking. An unmarked striker Hurshid Lutfullaev tapped the ball home in the 29th minute from a left-side cross to put his side 1-0 in the first half. Eight minutes into the second half, Lutfullaev scored with a well-judged header. Jamshedov made it 3-0 with a left footer four minutes later. Bangladesh later played all-out, but failed to reduce the margin in their first-ever game against Kyrgyzstan. bd
