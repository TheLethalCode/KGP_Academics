 MADRID, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Dutch winger Arjen Robben said he felt honoured to be one of the most expensive players to join Real Madrid after completing a 36-million euro ($48.80 million) move from Chelsea to the Spanish champions. "Firstly, I know it is a lot of money they have paid, but it shows the interest they had in getting me here," Robben told a news conference on Thursday after signing a five-year contract. "They showed they were ready to do everything to get me here." Robben, the fourth most expensive signing in the club's history behind "Galacticos" Zinedine Zidane, Luis Figo and Ronaldo, was welcomed by some 3,000 fans at the Bernabeu. Still beaming from the reception he was given, the 23-year-old said he was delighted that one of the close season's longest transfer sagas had come to an end. "For me it was a big relief when the final word came yesterday," he said. "It was a difficult time because I was waiting for it since the first day I was back training with Chelsea." Asked about why he decided to leave the London club, the Dutch international said that his injury problems and the club's loss of confidence in him were the reasons. "I had three very nice years at Chelsea, it was a great experience for me," he said. "I won every prize I could win in England, but I had too many injuries there so didn't make the impact I wanted to. I see this as a new start and a new chance and I hope I can stay out of that terrible (treatment) room. "After a while I felt I wasn't getting the confidence I needed and I started changing my mind (about staying) and when a massive big club like Real Madrid comes for you it gives you a lot of confidence." The pacy winger said that he was determined to prove he was not injury prone after suffering a series of problems at Stamford Bridge over the past two seasons. "I will prove that I'm not like that," he said. "For a player the most frustrating thing is to be injured, but I know I'm strong and I'm full of confidence I can do it here.
