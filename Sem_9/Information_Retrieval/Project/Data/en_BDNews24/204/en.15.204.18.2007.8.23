<TITLE> Govt warns CSB, ETV on 'breach' of rules </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com)The interim government Thursday asked private TV stations CSB and ETV to stop broadcasting "provocative content". "Several news items broadcast by the two TV channels breached emergency rules. They will be served notices for this. The government will take action if they continue to do so," information adviser Mainul Hosein told bdnews24.com by phone. In a statement, the Press Information Department quoting the twin "orders" said the two TV stations had run "provocative news, video footage and talk shows against the government" for the last few days. But neither the PID statement nor the adviser in the phone interview explained which news item of the TV channels had exactly breached the emergency rules. The PID statement points out that the breach of the emergency rules is a punishable offence. In the wake of the curfew that started at 8pm Wednesday and continued into a second day with a three-hour break, the council of advisers held a meeting at the Chief Adviser's Office. The meeting discussed the alleged harassment of journalists during the curfew hours, Mainul said. The government will take "necessary steps" to make sure that journalists are not harassed, he said. The adviser also hinted that the curfew would be lifted for Friday prayers. Asked if the government would do so, Mainul said: "I think it should be. But no decision has yet been taken." bdn
