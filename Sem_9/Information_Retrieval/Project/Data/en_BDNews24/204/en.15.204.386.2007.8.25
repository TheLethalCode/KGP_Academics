<TITLE> Salman Khan to surrender to court </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MUMBAI, August 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bollywood star Salman Khan said on Saturday he would surrender in Jodhpur after a court rejected his appeal against a five-year conviction for shooting an endangered species of gazelle. The actor went on a series of hunting trips in Rajasthan in 1998 with celebrity friends while filming a movie, and was convicted in 2006 for killing several endangered species of antelope protected under Indian wildlife law. He was alleged to have slit the throat of the chinkara -- a type of gazelle that he shot before giving it to chefs at his deluxe hotel to cook. On Friday, a court in Jodhpur in Rajasthan rejected his appeal against the conviction, leaving him with the option of surrendering to the court or being arrested. "I think as a responsible citizen and somebody who abides by the law and respects the judiciary, I should go to Jodhpur and surrender myself," Khan told reporters before leaving his Mumbai residence for the airport to Jodhpur. He was accompanied by his lawyer and family members whom he hugged as he left for the airport. "We are going as per law. No one has told me to go to Jodhpur, apparently some arrest warrant has been issued," said Khan, wearing a tight-fitting white T-shirt and cargo pants with sunglasses. "Hopefully everything will be sorted out." Khan was not present at his hearing in Jodhpur against his conviction on Friday and will now appeal to a higher court, probably early next week, one of his lawyers, Dipesh Mehta, said. Known for his bad-boy image and romantic liaisons with several Bollywood leading ladies, Khan has several other cases hanging over him. He was convicted in 2006 for killing protected blackbuck antelopes during Rajasthan hunting trips, and given a one-year jail sentence. He was granted bail and has appealed against that conviction, but has also been charged with other counts of killing wildlife and of breaking gun laws. Khan is also facing trial over the death of a man sleeping on a pavement in Mumbai in 2002. Khan is suspected of drunk driving and has been charged over the man's death. The actor has denied being at the wheel. Khan is currently filming three movies costing about 1 billion rupees, according to film analyst Taran Adar
