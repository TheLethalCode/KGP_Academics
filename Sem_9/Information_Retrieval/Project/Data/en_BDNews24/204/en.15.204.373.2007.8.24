 Dhaka, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League and some other political parties Friday asked the government to be cautious in handling the ongoing restive situation and not to be 'repressive'. They urged the government to sit with the parties to try and resolve matters. They also expressed concern at the detention of two Dhaka University professors by joint forces. "The government will have to take decisions with caution. They will have to take decisions to tackle the situation instead of resorting to repressive measures. "The government will have to thrash out problems patiently," Awami League presidium member Tofail Ahmed said. He was speaking to reporters after Friday prayers at a function marking the death anniversary of Awami League leader Ivy Rahman, killed in the August 21, 2004 grenade attack. He described the detention of the two professors as sad. "The solution to the present problem is not possible through use of force. In the past many tried to solve problems this way, but failed," Communist Party of Bangladesh general secretary Mujahidul Islam Selim told reporters. "People have become suspicious whether adequate steps are being taken for holding elections. So the problem has to be solved through discussion with all political parties," said Selim. "The government is walking the old path. The government has made the situation complex by arresting university teachers, including the Dhaka University Teachers' Association general secretary," Bangladesh Workers' Party president Rashed Khan Menon said. "The government will have to find a solution through discussion," he added. JSD president Hasanul Haque Inu also aired concern at the arrest of the Dhaka University teachers. "The government has to be patient. The government should not, in any way, take extreme measures." "The government will have to start the process of dialogue with the political parties and social forces without delay," he urged. Joint forces had picked up general secretary of Dhaka University Teachers' Association Prof Anwar Hossain and social sciencek faculty dean Prof Harun-or-Rashid from their homes on Fuller Road early Friday. bdnews24.com/
