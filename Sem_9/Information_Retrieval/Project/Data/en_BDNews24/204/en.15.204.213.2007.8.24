 TBILISI, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Georgian court on Friday gave prison sentences of up to 8 1/2 years to 13 pro-Russia opposition activists after finding them guilty of plotting to overthrow the country's pro-Western leadership. Most of the 13 are linked with the Justice Party led by Igor Giorgadze, an emigre opponent of Georgia's government. They refused to appear in court in protest at the trial. Georgian officials say the Justice Party is financed by Russia. The sentences ranged from three years to 8 1/2 years.
