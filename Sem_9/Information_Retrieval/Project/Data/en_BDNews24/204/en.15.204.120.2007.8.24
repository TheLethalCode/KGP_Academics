<TITLE> Bush's Middle East peace bid seen floundering </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CAIRO, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President George W. Bush plans to host a conference on Palestinian statehood later this year, but few in the Middle East are predicting an Arab-Israeli breakthrough that would help him transcend his troubles in Iraq. "The (Bush) administration is not prepared for a successful meeting. There are no indications that this conference will be successful," former Egyptian foreign minister Ahmed Maher told Reuters. "The bases on which it will be held are unclear." Egypt, a longtime US ally and one of only two Arab states to make peace with Israel, played a facilitating role in past Israeli-Palestinian talks which failed to end the conflict. "This is the last chance for the Bush administration," said Hesham Youssef, chief of staff to Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa. "If it (the meeting) does not succeed, it will be a huge setback." Arab officials say the United States has given few details about the agenda for the conference, expected in November, leaving little time for a concerted international effort to help Israelis and Palestinians bridge the chasm on issues such as final borders, Jerusalem and the fate of Palestinian refugees. They note that Bush's two predecessors failed even though they put much greater effort into peacemaking. President George Bush laid the groundwork for the Madrid peace conference in 1991 and Bill Clinton spent long hours with Middle East leaders. Palestinian and Western officials in Jerusalem have said Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert are trying to hammer out an agreement on the "principles" for a Palestinian state before the conference. And a senior Western official said the parties might merely appoint working groups on key issues rather than announcing the start of full-blown negotiations at the conference. Youssef, however, said Arabs want any deal to be implemented before the Bush administration leaves office in January 2009. "President Bush needs some success. So...he needs to work hard. He feels the Arab world is ready to work with him. The question now is whether Israel is ready to work with him." The Arab participants will press for a settlement based on the Arab land-for-peace initiative, which offers Israel normal ties with all Arab states in return for a full withdrawal from the lands it occupied in the 1967 war, creation of a Palestinian state and a "just solution" for refugees. Israel has said the Arab initiative could be the basis for negotiation, without committing itself to its main provisions. Arab analysts and officials say Washington appears reluctant to press Israel to make a long-term deal with the Arabs, or to bolster Abbas by freeing more prisoners, easing travel curbs in the occupied West Bank or uprooting Jewish outposts there. Some analysts say Israel might resist any such pressure even if it was forthcoming, knowing the U.S. administration is already under fire over Iraq and is nearing the end of its term. The willingness of the Palestinians and Arab states to compromise also remains to be seen. The widening divide between Abbas and the Islamist movement Hamas, which crushed his more secular Fatah group in Gaza in June, further dims prospects for any major progress. Washington and its European allies have supported Abbas against Hamas since the Gaza takeover, but Maher argued that this strategy weakens the Palestinian negotiating position. "If the Palestinians are not united at this conference, it will not achieve anything," he said. Even an agreement on principles, in the absence of guarantees that talks on substantive issues would soon follow, would scarcely reassure Arabs who had hoped that a similar declaration signed in Oslo in 1993 would end the conflict. "I rather suspect that they (the Israelis) are not going to make any prior commitments on a timetable and even on the outcome," a senior Western official in Cairo said, adding that a mere declaration of principles would be greeted with cynicism. Egyptian political analyst Amr el-Choubaki said a declaration of principles would achieve little. "The only significant change is taking practical steps to establish a Palestinian state, and this requires Israel's agreement on issues like the West bank and Jerusalem. This will not happen at the conference," he sa
