 EL-GENEINA, Sun Aug 26, Sudan (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - African Union envoy Salim Ahmed Salim on Sunday urged all parties to Darfur's 4-1/2-year-old conflict to commit to a ceasefire to support peace talks due to begin in October. Salim, who will travel to rebel Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) founder Abdel Wahed Mohamed el-Nur's birth town of Zalengei, said that any peace deal needed to be accepted by the entire population of Darfur to work. "We've talked to the movements, we talked to the government but at the end of the day it's important that whatever agreement that eventually comes ... must be accepted by the Darfurians," he told Reuters during a trip to Darfur. Nur has refused to join the ranks of many rebel commanders and factions to return to the negotiating table until an international U.N.-African Union force is deployed to Sudan's remote west to ensure that rape, killing and looting ends. But Salim said talks were the only way to achieve that and urged Nur, living in Paris, to come to the negotiating table. "We share the view that it would be much better to start negotiations when there is security," he said. "I accept Abdel Wahed's position. I accept everywhere we have been the concern has been security," he said. "(But) what I don't accept is to say unless we have absolute security it is not worth it because at the end of the day it is the negotiations which will ensure durable security." Salim on Sunday will meet both Arab and non-Arab tribal leaders in West Darfur's capital el-Geneina and on Monday will meet those chased from their homes to camps in and around Zalengei town. The 7,000-strong struggling African Union peacekeeping mission has faced opposition from those squatting in Zalengei, many of whom support Nur and oppose last year's AU-mediated peace deal. Nur has few loyal troops on the ground in Darfur but massive support among the largest Fur tribe. Hundreds of thousands say they will only accept a deal he has signed. Salim said an agreement to deploy a joint 26,000-strong U.N.-African Union mission to Darfur would improve monitoring mechanisms to hold those violating a ceasefire to account. "With the coming of the hybrid certainly there will qualitative improvement in terms of the ability of the U.N. and AU to deal with these things, he said. "But ... the responsibility for security cannot be that of the international force," he said. "It is the commitment on the part of the stakeholders ... especially the government but also the fighters in this process." Only one of three negotiating rebel factions signed a Darfur peace deal last year. Since then, the insurgents have split into more than a dozen factions and Minni Arcua Minnawi who signed and became senior assistant to President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, has wielded little power. Minnawi's group last week accused Bashir's army of continuing to arm militias in South Darfur, who were attacking villages in their areas. Khartoum mobilized tribal militias to quell the revolt begun in early 2003 by mostly non-Arab rebels accusing the central government of marginalizing the arid region. International experts estimate 200,000 have died and 2.5 million have been driven from their homes during the fighting. The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for one junior cabinet minister and a militia leader accused of war crim
