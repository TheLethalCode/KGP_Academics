<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com)  British High Commissioner Anwar Choudhury Sunday said a rise in the prices of essential commodities created grievances, which for him was part of the reason people took to street violence. Particularly on the Dhaka University violence, he said: "The initial incident was spontaneous. Later it became a coordinated attempt." The envoy's comment came after a discussion with foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury at the foreign ministry. The discussion was designed to brief the envoys of about 40 foreign countries and organisations on floods and the current situation in Bangladesh. Choudhury said the government had accepted the demand of students, and pulled back the troops from Dhaka University campus and regretted the initial incident. But it did not stop violencea fact which raised questions in public mind, he said. It appeared laterbased on reportsthat a group funded people as an incentive to resort to the violence that pulled in other people from different quarters as well. Pressed to comment on why the violence was so spontaneous, the envoy pointed to the runaway prices of essential commodities which created grievances among people. He said the government pledged to hold elections by the end of 2008, the Election Commission rolled out a roadmap and there was a lot of progress on it. But the government failed to rein in the rising prices of essentials. He said the envoys did not discuss the arrests of five university teachers with the foreign adviser. But he believed that the innocent people would be released. On the harassment of journalists during the curfew, Choudhury said he believed the government would take action against those responsible. He said the controls on the media were not as severe in Bangladesh as often seen elsewhere in times of emergency. Choudhury urged people to work responsibly. bdnews24.c
