<TITLE> Japan PM rapped by party for huge election loss </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was sharply criticised by his own party on Friday for a huge election loss last month, with the party saying he was seen as out of touch with voters' interests. The rare public criticism by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) comes a month after voter anger over lost pension premiums, corruption scandals and gaffes led to an election drubbing that cost Abe's coalition control of parliament's upper house. "It may be that Prime Minister Abe had an image of siding with Nagatacho's politicians rather than the general public," the party said in the nine-page report analysing the election loss. Nagatacho is the name of Tokyo's parliamentary district. "There may have been doubts from the public over his leadership and his governing abilities," the party added, in reference to Abe's handling of political funding scandals involving cabinet members. Abe has been blamed for focusing too much on his conservative agenda such as revising Japan's pacifist post-war constitution, while voters' main concerns were with bread-and-butter issues, including pensions and healthcare. Despite the big loss and calls for him to go from some lawmakers within his own party, Abe did not step down after the election, saying he wanted to push on with his conservative reforms and boosting the economy. In a bid for a fresh start, Abe will revamp his cabinet on Monday, after his first line-up was hit by a series of political funding scandals and gaffes. The leader has given few clues on candidates, although his defence minister, Yuriko Koike, was quoted on Friday as saying she wanted to resign from her post and the finance minister is also tipped by the media to go. Koike became Japan's first female defence minister just last month after her predecessor quit over a gaffe and she had been expected to remain since replacing her soon might look odd. But her future has been clouded since Abe stepped in to end a public row she was having with the top official at her own ministry.
