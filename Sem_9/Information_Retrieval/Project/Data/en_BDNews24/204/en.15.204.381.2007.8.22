 Dhaka, August 22 (bdnews24.com) - Private university students along with locals set fire to a restaurant and vandalised at least 15 commercial buildings on Satmasjid Road in Dhanmondi Wednesday night. The private university students had joined in pressing the five-point demands placed by Dhaka University students a day before. bdnews24.com found that students had set fire at various points along Satmasjid Road, and had broken glass windows of more than 15 roadside commercial buildings, but without touching educational institutes. The Four Seasons restaurant faced protesters' anger after some restaurant workers, joining hands with police, hurled stones and bottles at the demonstrators, who were on the way to Mohammadpur via Satmasjid Road. Clashes with police at Sanker led agitators to break the glass frontage and set fire to the restaurant at about 4pm. At least one person named Ahsan, who was inside the restaurant during the fire, was rescued from the blazing building. Fire fighters were battling the flames for at least three hours. Some locals also looted restaurant property. The police-student battle initially erupted at Zigatala in the morning when police barred a procession, of private university students and locals, from going towards Dhaka University campus. Police fired teargas shells to calm the mob, according to witnesses. Anwar Hossain, officer in charge of New Market Police station said the violence began at about 11 am, but did not explain why it erupted. The agitating students eventually blocked the entire road from Zigatala to Sanker clashes with police that lasted several hours. "We were attacked and injured by police. That's why we are protesting," said a BBA second year student of the private University of Development Alternative, declining to provide his name. "We will continue until our demand is met," he added. A student of the University of Liberal Arts at Zigatala also accused police of beating fellow students. "Police entered our campus last night (Tuesday night) and beat us, including security guards," he said. "What did we do wrong that we were beaten?" he asked. "We have started a silent procession to express our solidarity with Dhaka University students," said another student from Northern University. Road communication between Sanker and Zigatala were suspended through the day up to the start of curfew at 8pm Wednesday night. bdn
