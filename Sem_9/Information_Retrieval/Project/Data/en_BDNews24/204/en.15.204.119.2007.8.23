<TITLE> Bush insists he supports "good man" Maliki </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KANSAS CITY, Mo. Aug 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A day after expressing frustration with the Iraqi leadership, US President George W Bush said on Wednesday he supported Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki as "a good man with a difficult job." At a summit of North American leaders on Tuesday, Bush had failed to offer a direct endorsement of Maliki and urged him to do more to broker peace among the warring sides in Iraq. But in Wednesday's speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars organization, Bush said: "Prime Minister Maliki is a good guy, a good man, with a difficult job and I support him." On Tuesday, the US ambassador to Iraq, Ryan Crocker, had called political progress in Iraq "extremely disappointing" and warned that US support for Maliki's government was not a "blank check." US officials have sent mixed signals about their views on the Iraqi government just a few weeks before Crocker and the top US commander in Iraq, Gen. David Petraeus, are expected to submit a pivotal report in mid-September assessing the US troop build-up put in place this year. The report comes as the Democratic-led Congress presses for US troops to be withdrawn from Iraq as soon as possible. The Bush administration has been defending the troop increase by saying it was achieving progress on the military goal of achieving greater security. But US officials, including Bush, have acknowledged that, on the goal of political reconciliation in Iraq, there has been less progress. A senior Democratic senator, Carl Levin, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has urged that Maliki's government be voted out of power. In his address to the veterans group, Bush did echo some of his comments at the leaders' summit in Quebec in which he said it was not the decision of US politicians to decide whether to replace Maliki. "That is up to the Iraqi people," Bush said. bd
