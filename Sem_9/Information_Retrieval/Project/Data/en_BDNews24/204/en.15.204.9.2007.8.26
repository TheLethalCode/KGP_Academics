<TEXT>
 BEIJING, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China's Foreign Ministry has given a muted response to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's tribute to an Indian figure revered by Japanese nationalists, despite fears Abe's move would irritate fragile relations. Visiting India last week, Abe met the son of an Indian judge who opposed punishing Japanese war criminals convicted by an Allied tribunal after World War Two. Radhabinod Pal was the only member of the 11-judge tribunal to voice dissent at the process. China's Foreign Ministry refrained from criticising Abe directly for the visit, saying only that the trial was an important foundation for post-war Japan to return to the international community. The trial represented the voices of peace-loving people around the world, including the Japanese people, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu said in a statement on the ministry's Web site (www.fmprc.gov.cn) posted late on Saturday. "The international community reached its final conclusion on this issue long ago," Jiang said. Abe's 20-minute meeting with Pal's son, Prasanta Pal, was seen as a move to woo conservative supporters at home, but critics said it was aimed at claiming innocence for war criminals. Relations between Beijing and Tokyo have been strained by a series of issues, from territorial disputes to history, with much of the tension between the Northeast Asian powers stemming from Japan's wartime invasion of China. Visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, where convicted war criminals are honoured, by former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi were a constant source of friction with China. But since Abe took power last year he has refrained from visiting the site and ties have been improving, with he and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao exchanging fence-mending visits. bd
