<TEXT>
 FREETOWN, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sierra Leone will hold a presidential election run-off on Sept. 8 between main opposition leader Ernest Bai Koroma and Solomon Berewa of the ruling Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP). None of the candidates won 55 percent of the vote to win office outright in the first round, the West African country's electoral commission said on Saturday. Koroma of the All People's Congress (APC) took 44.3 percent and Berewa won 38.3 percent, official final results showed. Veteran politician Charles Margai of the People's Movement for Democratic Change (PMDC), regarded as a potential kingmaker in the second round, won 13.9 percent of the Aug. 11 vote. The election is the first since United Nations peacekeepers left Sierra Leone two years ago following a 1991-2002 civil war. They are regarded as a test of the former British colony's recovery from more than a decade of brutality. Margai, who defected from the ruling SLPP when it chose Berewa as its presidential candidate, has said he will back Koroma on a joint campaign tour for the second round. The APC also performed strongly in a parliamentary election held alongside the presidential vote. The party took 59 of 112 seats in parliament, compared to 43 for the SLPP and 10 for the PMDC, final official results showed. "It is widely acknowledged that the results are credible and that the elections have been conducted in a manner that is free, fair and transparent," National Electoral Commission president Christiana Thorpe said as she announced the results. "The NEC will do everything in its power to ensure that the run-off election is also credible and something that the people of Sierra Leone will be proud of." Margai's endorsement will likely hand the northerner Koroma extra support in the southern part of the country -- Margai's home and the traditional heartland of SLPP support. But with many of Margai's followers former SLPP supporters, it is not certain all of them will back Koroma, meaning the run-off with Berewa is likely to be a closely-fought contest. "With such an overwhelming majority for the APC, traditional SLPP supporters who voted PMDC in the first round may feel obliged to return to the SLPP for the second round in order to achieve an ethnic balance of power," said Nana Adu Ampofo, an Africa analyst with research group Global Insight.
