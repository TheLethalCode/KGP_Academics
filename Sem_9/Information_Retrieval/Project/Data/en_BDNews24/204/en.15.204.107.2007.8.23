 AUCKLAND, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand spinner Daniel Vettori says he has not decided what his approach as captain would be at next month's Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa. "I wouldn't really know," he told reporters in a conference call from Auckland on Thursday. "But I'm a bowler and that will no doubt have an influence." Left-arm spinner Vettori will take over from Stephen Fleming, who had been captain since 1997. Fleming, 34, resigned as one-day captain after his team lost their 2007 World Cup semi-final to Sri Lanka and was left out for the inaugural Twenty20 championship starting on Sept. 11. Vettori, 28, has been a prominent member of the team since making his test debut against England in Wellington in 1997 and has captained in 11 of his 201 one-dayers. "To have a team under your guidance makes a huge difference," he said. "You get to do things your way, but it is daunting." Although the shortest format of the game favoured batsmen, Vettori felt attacking bowling tactics would serve teams well. "You still have to remain aggressive," he said. "Spin bowlers look to take wickets most of the time, and I think bowlers who stay aggressive will be more successful." The 12-team tournament ends with the final on Sept. 24
