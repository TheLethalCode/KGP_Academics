 BHUBANESWAR, India, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hundreds of snakes, forced out of their pits by flood waters, have entered villagers' homes in eastern India creating panic and adding to the torment caused by monsoon flooding, officials said on Friday. Around 1,850 people have been killed -- scores of them due to snake bites -- since July when swollen rivers burst their banks, inundating huge areas in eastern India and Bangladesh. The others have been killed by drowning, diarrhoea and in house collapses.

Authorities used loudspeakers to order villagers to evacuate homes in Muzaffarpur district as swelling rivers breached mud embankments in many places. Angry villagers in Samastipur district stopped a train, fearing its movement could damage a weak embankment along the track, and assaulted officials who tried to stop them, witnesses and officials said. "We are very afraid of more floods," said Kalavati Devi, a flood victim, justifying stopping the train. In neighbouring West Bengal state, two children drowned as fresh flooding forced thousands of people into relief camps. Across the border in Bangladesh, hundreds have died over the past few weeks due to massive flooding, with thousands of people suffering from diarrhoea.
