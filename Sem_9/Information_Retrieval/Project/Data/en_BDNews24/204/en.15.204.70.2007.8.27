 Dhaka, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com)  Captain Mohammad Ashraful is confident about repeating the ICC World Cup feat of securing a second-round berth in next month's Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa. Bangladesh are in Group A along with hosts South Africa and the West Indies in the inaugural version of ICC Twenty20 World Cup. "To confirm a second-round berth, we have to beat stronger South Africa or the West Indies, and we are confident of securing a second-round place as in the last edition of the ICC World Cup in the West Indies," Ashraful said at a press conference at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium Monday. "We have the experience of beating South Africa in the West Indies, and if everyone plays potentially, we will be able to secure a second-round berth," said the Bangladesh captain. Tigers' two-week practice - one week commando training in Sylhet in a bid to strengthen the physical and mental ability, and the other week consisting of Twenty20 matches - ended Monday. The team leave for Kenya Wednesday to play a four-nation Twenty20 tournament. Bangladesh will play three matches against hosts Kenya, Pakistan and Uganda in the tournament before leaving Nairobi for South Africa. The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) Monday allowed all 15 players to talk to the media and brought all of them to the press conference. Vice captain Mashrafee Bin Mortaza felt that the Twenty20 game wicket would not play any major role in the outcome of the game. "We will fall behind if we think of the wicket," Mashrafee added. "We will be able to beat our opponents if we can show our natural performances," said Bangladesh's pace spearhead adding that the Twenty20 is a funny game, but not a relaxed one for the players. Other players said that they would try to put in their best in their respective positions.
