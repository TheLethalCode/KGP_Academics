 LONDON, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's competition watchdog plans to end four years of price controls on the largest banks' services for small and medium-sized firms, though the sector remains one of the most concentrated in UK banking. The controls were introduced after a 2002 investigation found four lenders -- Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds TSB and the Royal Bank of Scotland -- held more than 90 percent of the SME market and that customers were unwilling to switch banks due to costs and red tape. To encourage competition, the four banks were required, among other things, to offer either an account paying interest of at least 2.5 percentage points below the base rate, or free money transmission services such as direct debit payments or both. The Competition Commission said on Thursday that competition from banking rivals such as HBOS, Abbey and Alliance & Leicester meant it could lift its requirements, despite the fact that top banks still hold an 85 percent market share. "SMEs have raised their expectations of what banks should provide and are more likely to consider switching if they do not get what they want," Commission Deputy Chairman Christopher Clarke said in a statement. The Federation of Small Businesses, however, attacked the Commission's decision and said there was no evidence banks were complying with their requirements. "We are utterly bewildered by the Competition Commission's provisional decision in this case," said Mike Cherry, financial affairs chairman at the FSB. "We have provided concrete evidence that the big four banks are not complying with the undertakings ... and the Competition Commission appears to have completely ignored it." Lender HBOS, which was already offering charge-free banking and interest on current accounts for SMEs before the Commission's 2003 move, said separately there was little evidence the controls had helped increase competition. "Price controls have clearly done little to encourage small businesses to switch banks, and the hassle factor of switching has still to be addressed," said Mark Curran, head of relationship management in HBOS's business banking division. Analysts said they did not expect Thursday's decision to have a significant financial impact on banks. The initial ruling led several banks to tap alternative income to offset lost fees, and it could be hard for banks to ramp up fees or withdraw offers of interest on deposits without losing customers. Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said they had allowed for a reduction of around 2 percent in 2008 profits for the four large banks to take account of potentially tighter controls and that now they planned to unwind this discount. The Competition Commission's decision to lift the price controls imposed in 2003 is provisional. The deadline for responses to the move is Sept. 28. The four banks will remain bound to publicizing changes in pricing as well as to "behavioural undertakings" including an agreement to ensure customers can switch accounts easily.
