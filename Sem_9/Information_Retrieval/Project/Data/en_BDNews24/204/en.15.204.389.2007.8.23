 ABUJA, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nigeria's new Finance Minister Shamsuddeen Usman said on Thursday he would accelerate the country's economic transformation and sustain macroeconomic stability achieved under a reform programme launched in 2003. In his first news conference since taking office on July 26, Usman said he was suspending the granting of any new tax or import duty waivers and exemptions immediately to stop revenue losses which he described as "alarming". "Urgent attention will be paid to plugging a number of sources of revenue leakages that seem to have become ... a great source of corruption, especially the large number of waivers and exemptions that were granted under the previous administration," he said. Usman said external auditors would scrutinise all existing exemptions and uncover any illegalities. The former central banker also said two bills had been submitted to the National Assembly to review the 2007 budget to finance a 15 percent public sector pay rise promised by President Umaru Yar'Adua after a general strike in June. One amends existing 2007 expenditure by redirecting $1.35 billion away from capital projects, overheads and debt service to fund the $1.4 billion wage rise. The other bill proposes $609 million in new spending, mostly for the payment of severance benefits and contractor arrears as well as unspecified "additional reforms", he said. The government plans to legislate for a new "strategic oil revenue reserve fund" to save windfall oil income above the budgeted price, Usman said. Nigeria already has an excess crude account in which it saves unbudgeted oil revenues. But the management of the account is being challenged in court because under the constitution the federal government is not supposed to withhold funds that also belong to state and local governments. Usman said the new plan was for the three tiers of government to agree a legal way to save and manage windfall oil revenues. This would be "difficult and slow", he said. The budget price of oil this year is supposed to be $40 per barrel, but Usman said in the first half it had effectively been $67. This was because lower-than-projected oil production had forced government to tap into its savings to plug revenue shortfalls and fund the budget. He said the 2008 benchmark price would be "more realistic" but declined to give a figure. The 2008 budget would be presented to the National Assembly on Oct. 8, he said. Usman said Yar'Adua had yet to sign into law a fiscal responsibility bill, seen as crucial by the IMF, that was passed by the previous National Assembly just before it stepped down. Yar'Adua was consulting with state governors and trying to persuade them to pass similar legislation in their states. He listed priorities including reforming a bloated and ineffective civil service, improving surveillance of government debt, encouraging the government to use the capital markets to fund infrastructure development, sustaining capital market reforms and enhancing revenue collection.
