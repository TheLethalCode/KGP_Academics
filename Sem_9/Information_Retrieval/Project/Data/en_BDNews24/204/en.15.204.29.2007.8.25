<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com)  Two courts Saturday sent five university teachers and one student leader into days of remand in connection with Dhaka University violence that later spread to Rajshahi University. A Dhaka court allowed interrogators four days to quiz Dhaka University teachers Anwar Hossain and Harun-or-Rashid. Rajshahi University teachers Saidur Rahman Khan, Abdus Sobhan and Moloy Kumar Bhowmik have been sent into 10-day remand, in line with a Rajshahi court order. Azizul Bari Helal, the president of the BNP's student wing, will be interrogated for five days, the Dhaka court ordered. The charges involve making provocative statements and instigating unrest on the campus that later spilled out into the streets of the capital. The new development has created panic among colleagues and the families of detainees. The DU authorities asked the military-backed government to be cautious in dealing with the cases of the teachers. In another development, interim leader Fakhruddin Ahmed assured the DU authorities of "honourable treatment" to the detained teachers while the Awami League condemned the arrest and their subsequent remand. SHATTERRED FATES It all began after the DU teachers, Prof Anwar Hossain and Prof Harun-or-Rashid, were taken to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court in Dhaka at 2:20pm, about 36 hours after their arrest late Thursday. The two teachers are facing charges of having roles in "illegal attacks and property damage," tied to the DU violence. The two teachers were charged under the emergency powers rules. They were accused of instigating the Dhaka University incidents, making provocative statements against the emergency powers rules, and abetting students and others in an attack on the Dhaka University gymnasium. Shahbagh police sought a 10-day remand for the pair although the court granted only four days. Supreme Court lawyer Mahbubey Alam stood for them in court along with about 50 other lawyers. Advocate Sanaullah Miah pleaded for Helal. The police read out the allegations against him and sought a 10-day remand, but the court granted five days. Helal faces allegations of creating panic in the public mind and obstructing traffic by setting tyres on fire in front of the Teacher-Student Centre, the vice chancellor's residence and F Rahman Hall. Meanwhile, a court in Rajshahi allowed police to take each of the three Rajshahi University teachers into a 10-day remand. The teachers, Saidur Rahman Khan, Abdus Sobhan and Moloy Kumar Bhowmik, were produced before the court of Rajshahi metropolitan magistrate Rabiul Islam at 6pm in a vehicle of joint forces amid tight security. Motihar police sub-inspector Farukh Hossain appealed to the court for a 10-day remand for each of the teachers, accusing them of violating the emergency powers rules. Hossain Wednesday night filed a case against 2,500 unidentified people in connection with the student protests. Khan, a former vice-chancellor and Awami League advisory council member, was arrested early Friday. The joint forces arrested Prof Abdus Sobhan separately also early Friday while Prof Bhowmik was arrested in the evening. DU acting VC AFM Yousuf Haider said that he got assurance from chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed that his two colleagues would be given "honourable treatment". SON ALLEGES TORTURE Sanjib Hossain, son of Prof Anwar Hossain, alleged that his father and Prof Harun-or-Rashid had been tortured "physically and mentally" in early hours in custody. "They were kept in a place called Black Hole of an intelligence agency after their arrest," Sanjib said. "My father got a chance to speak for some time when he was taken to court. He said that they kept him in a place named Black hole," he said. Acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman Saturday said: "I don't think it was necessary to arrest them. If the government fails to show tolerance, the result won't be good." "Nothing is better than tolerance in politics," he said, adding that the matter of taking them on remand is very sad. bdnews24.com/
