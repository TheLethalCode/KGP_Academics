<TEXT>
 VIENNA, Aug 24 (Reuters) - An Austrian company said on Friday it had sold the most expensive "Lederhosen" ever made -- a diamond-studded pair of Alpine leather trousers that cost 85,000 euros ($115,000). The trousers, fashioned from the leather of a wild red deer and adorned with 166 diamonds set in gold, were bought by a German who lives in Dubai, according to Christian Wohlmuther, whose shop for traditional clothing made the special order. Lederhosen -- made for centuries from the hide of elk, goat, or pig -- can last a lifetime. Often knee-length, they are sometimes elaborately embroidered with monograms and hunting designs and remain popular in many Alpine regions.
