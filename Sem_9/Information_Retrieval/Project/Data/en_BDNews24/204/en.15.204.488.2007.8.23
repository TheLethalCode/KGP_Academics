 BRUSSELS, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European Union veterinary experts agreed on Thursday to let all of Britain except part of Surrey resume exports of live animals, meat and dairy products to other EU countries, the EU executive said. The committee of EU vets endorsed a European Commission proposal to limit the bloc's export restrictions to a 10-kilometre surveillance zone in Surrey, where two outbreaks of foot and mouth disease were confirmed earlier this month. "This means that exports of live animals, meat and dairy products will be able to resume from the territory of Great Britain, apart from the 10 km zone in the county of Surrey," the Commission said. The decision enters into force on Aug. 25. "This reduction in the control measures at this stage has been possible because of the favourable evolution in the disease situation and the strict and immediate movement ban implemented in the whole of Great Britain," it said in a statement. The EU's amended trade restrictions on British livestock exports will apply until Sept. 15 but be reviewed again at a further EU vets' meeting scheduled for Sept. 11, it added. The highly infectious virus was found in early August on two farms in Surrey, forcing more than 570 animals to be destroyed and prompting the European Union and other countries to ban British meat and dairy exports. The outbreaks came as an unwelcome reminder of 2001, when foot and mouth disease devastated British farming and led to the slaughter of more than 6 million animals, many of which were burned on huge bonfires
