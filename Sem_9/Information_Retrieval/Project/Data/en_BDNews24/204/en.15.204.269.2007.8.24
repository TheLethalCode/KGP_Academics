<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad Friday asked all to help the Election Commission implement the polls roadmap and thwart any move to hinder the polls. Before leaving for Saudi Arabia, Ershad said in a statement: "It will not be right to do anything at the moment that can hinder our main aim of holding a fair and proper election in the country by 2008." The former military dictator said the incident at Dhaka University was unwarranted and sad. He said the armed forces had played a historic role in paving the way for fulfilling the nation's aspirations, which the "changeover" on January 11 allowed. "The people remember the role of the armed forces with gratitude." He also said the prime task of the emergency government was to hold a free, fair and credible election by preparing a flawless voter list to hand over power to an elected government. "The government and the Election Commission have already announced a roadmap to [the elections]. I hope all will come forward sincerely to implement the roadmap." Ershad is scheduled to return home on September 3. bdnews24.
