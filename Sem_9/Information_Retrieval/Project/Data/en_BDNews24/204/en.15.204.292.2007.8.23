<TITLE> Yemen ban carrying weapons in capital-agency </TITLE>

 SANAA, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Yemen banned citizens from carrying firearms in the capital on Thursday, state news agency Saba said, part of a plan to curb violence and encourage investment in a country where arms are a way of life. The agency quoted a source from the interior ministry as saying authorities would also begin revoking the private firearms permits of those who owned weapons in Sanaa. Yemen's cabinet launched a campaign last April to shut down shops selling guns without a licence. It has spent millions of dollars in recent months buying up bombs, artillery and even anti-aircraft guns from ordinary civilians. The ban includes high-ranking officials -- only their bodyguards will be permitted to carry guns -- and will also cover heavily armed tribes, influential groups that resist government control. Residents of Sanaa have until an early September deadline to give up their weapons. Large numbers of arms were left in the hands of civilians in Yemen after the 1994 civil war. The state does not publish official statistics about the number of firearms held in the country, but some unofficial estimates put the number as high as 60 million. Western diplomats say the number is probably closer to 20 million, or one for every Yemeni.
