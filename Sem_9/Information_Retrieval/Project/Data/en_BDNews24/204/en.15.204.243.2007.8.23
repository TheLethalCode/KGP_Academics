 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com) -- Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board restored its international telecoms connectivity at 7:35pm Thursday, almost 19 hours after international communications went down. Now the country is again linked to the internet. All overseas voice and data circuits have also been revived. Suspected saboteurs had damaged BTTB's only optical fibre transmission link with the submarine cable, at Chunoti under Lohagara upazila at 1:00am Thursday. It immediately isolated Bangladesh from the rest of the world. "The motive of damaging the optical fibre cable, three feet underneath the ground, is unclear," Lohagara police chief Mizanur Rahman told bdnews24.com Chittagong Bureau Chief Faruque Iqbal. He said the possibility of sabotage is being investigated. But BTTB's director Giasuddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com he suspected that it may have been a case of theft. "Instead of digging three feet under ground, the saboteurs could have chopped the bare cable where it crosses the bridges and culverts." Ahmed noted, "The fact remains that it is the only national link to the worldwide internet. There should be a backup optical fibre link for disaster recovery." Sources also blame BTTB's obsolete network design for such a crisis. "Unlike Grameenphone, BTTB has failed to establish a nationwide transmission network to ensure seamless connectivity," a senior BTTB official told bdnews24.com. "If the transmission cable breaks at any point of a ring-shaped network, traffic would be easily re-routed without disrupting the service," he explained. Another source blames the BTTB hierarchy's lack of understanding over the simple yet state-of-the-art networking solution. "The authorities should figure out the revenue that BTTB has lost during the 19 hours of downtime," he demanded. bdne
