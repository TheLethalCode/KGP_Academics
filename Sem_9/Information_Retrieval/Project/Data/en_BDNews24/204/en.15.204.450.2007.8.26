 EL-GENEINA, Sudan, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sudan granted jailed opposition leader Mubarak al-Fadil urgently needed medical attention after more than 40 days in detention without charge, his daughter said on Sunday. Fadil, the head of the Umma Party for Reform and Renewal, his party secretary-general Abdel Jalil al-Basha and Ali Mahmoud Hassanein from the opposition Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) were among 25 people arrested last month accused of trying to overthrow the government.
