 Dhaka, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com)  Families are worrying about the two Dhaka University teachers joint forces picked up from the teachers' quarters on Fuller Road early Friday. The joint forces detained Dhaka University Teachers Association general secretary, Professor Anwar Hossain and Harun-or-Rashid, dean of social sciences. "We are in the dark about my father's life and whereabouts now," Dipannita Hossain, daughter of Anwar Hossain, said to bdnews24.com over telephone Friday. Harun-or-Rashid's son Ishtiaque Rashid had told bdnews24.com shortly after the arrest the joint forces had told him they would take him to Shahbagh Police Station. But duty officer Jamaluddin told bdnews24.com at 1:00am Friday that none of them was detained at their police station. "My father goes to bed early. We got scared when our door bell rang. We opened the door and some members of the joint forces asked me to call up my sleeping father," said Dipannita. "When my father got up and came to the drawing room, the troops said he would have to accompany them to the Shahbagh Police Station." "The security personnel also took my father's computer and mobile phone while he was being led away." Dipannita said they were worried about her father's whereabouts. Prof Harun-or- Rashid's daughter Barnali Harun and son Ishtiaque said they were not aware of their father's whereabouts either since his arrest. "The joint forces told us before taking him away that he was being taken to Shahbagh Police Station for interrogation. "But the Shahbagh Police Station said in the morning that he wasn't there. No one knows where they have taken him or how he is at the moment," said Ishtiaque. Barnali is a second-year telecommunications student at the North South University and Ishtiaque, a third-year genetic engineering and biotechnology student at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. Neighbouring teachers and relations were dropping in to enquire about the families of the two arrested teachers since morning. bdnews24.com
