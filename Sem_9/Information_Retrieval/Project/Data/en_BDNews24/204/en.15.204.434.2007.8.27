 OSAKA, Japan, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ethiopia's Kenenisa Bekele powered to his third 10,000 metres world title in a row with a pulsating victory on Monday. Bekele blew past countryman Sileshi Sihine coming around the final bend and accelerated clear, crossing himself as he hit the finish line in 27 minutes 5.90 seconds. The Olympic champion had time to blow kisses to the crowd in Osaka before turning around to see perennial bridesmaid Sihine come home to take silver again in 27:09.03. Kenya's Martin Irungu Mathathi took bronze in 27:12.17. Bekele moved to within one world championship gold of Ethiopian great Haile Gebrselassie, who won four between 1993 and 1999, in addition to the 1996 and 2000 Olympic titles
