 SYDNEY, August 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The equine influenza outbreak that has brought Australia's racing industry to a standstill is starting to spread, with hundreds of horses now displaying symptoms of the disease. Government officials confirmed on Sunday that the disease has spread out of Sydney into rural New South Wales and across the state border into Queensland. The government had tried to contain the highly-contagious disease by enforcing an unprecedented nationwide lockdown but their attempts appear to have failed. Australia's multi-billion dollar racing industry is already in turmoil because of the outbreak but further spread could threaten this year's Melbourne Cup and even jeopardize security plans for next month's APEC summit. The outbreak was initially restricted to two sites in Sydney, with just 16 horses testing positive when the shutdown was implemented on Saturday, but that figure had swollen to more than 200 by early on Sunday with the likelihood of more to come. Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran said there had already been one confirmed case of a horse testing positive outside Sydney and another nine horses in rural areas showed symptoms. Queensland Premier Peter Beattie said three horses had returned suspect results at an Equestrian World Cup event in Warwick, hundreds of kilometers north of Sydney. "This is the biggest crisis that has ever faced the racing and horse industry and we must leave no stone unturned at containing the outbreak," McGauran said. MOUNTED POLICE Australia boasts some of the toughest quarantine rules in the world and has never had a single case of horse flu before this outbreak, but the repercussions could have a devastating effect on the racing and breeding industry. The government has ordered a three-day ban on the movement of all horses, mules and donkeys while racing officials cancelled every major meeting in the country. The shutdown will cost the industry tens of millions of dollars every day and could run into the billions if the Melbourne Cup, which is due to be run in November, is effected. The Melbourne Cup attracts some of the best stayers from Britain, Europe and Asia but bookmakers have already frozen betting markets on the race amid speculation the outbreak will frighten off most of the international contenders. Hong Kong trainer John Moore announced on Sunday he was delaying the arrival of his hopefuls Viva Pataca and Viva Macau until the crisis was resolved. The ban on horse movement also threatens to affect next month's APEC summit meeting in Sydney, which will be attended by more than 20 international leaders including U.S. President George W Bush. Authorities were planning to bring in dozens of extra mounted police to deal with the major protests planned for the streets of Sydney but may have to review their plans for crowd control. "Maybe this will be an incentive for any protesters to behave rather better than might otherwise be the case," federal health minister Tony Abbott told Australian televisi
