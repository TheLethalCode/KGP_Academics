<TITLE> EU commissioner favours ban on German far-right party </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BERLIN, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union's Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini was quoted on Saturday as saying he would back any attempt to ban Germany's far-right National Democratic Party (NPD). Calls in Germany for a fresh drive to ban the NPD have intensified since a mob attacked and chased eight Indian men through the eastern town of Muegeln last weekend. "If there was to be a ban one day of the NPD in Germany, I would quite clearly welcome it," Frattini said in an interview with Sunday paper Bild am Sonntag published on Saturday. On Friday, German police said they had charged NPD leader Udo Voigt with inciting racial hatred after he recommended Adolf Hitler's former deputy Rudolf Hess for the Nobel peace prize. After the Muegeln attacks, Kurt Beck, leader of Germany's Social Democrats (SPD), urged legal experts to re-examine whether there was any possibility of banning the NPD. The SPD shares power with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives. A previous attempt to ban the NPD failed in 2003 when a minority of judges at the country's highest court rejected the government's case after it emerged that some of the testimony was from government informants within the party. Merkel said on Friday she was sceptical about pursuing a ban, stressing she did not want a repeat of the 2003 decision. Frattini said right-wing extremism was increasing in Europe, and that neo-Nazis were a real threat to democracy. "There are five countries in the EU which we're particularly worried about. These include Germany, but also France, Belgium and Denmark, and unfortunately things don't look much better in my home country Italy either," he told the paper.
