<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com) - Awami League president Sheikh Hasina Monday expressed doubt about her chances of receiving justice, according to her tax lawyer Khandoker Moniruzzaman. "Sheikh Hasina has become more disheartened since hearing the verdict passed by the Appellate Division," he said to reporters after meeting the former prime minister in the special jail sited in the Sangsad Bhaban complex. "She expressed her doubt about getting justice and mentioned that there was no need for the imposition of a curfew," he said. Moniruzzaman quoted Hasina as saying that the teachers started the movement spontaneously, but "now they are being harassed and tortured". The lawyer said some amendments would be made to Hasina's wealth statement in preparation for its submission to the Anticorruption Commission. "I have talked to her [Hasina] about it." Moniruzzaman said: "In the wealth statement a piece of land in Dighalia, Khulna was shown in Sheikh Hasina's name." "But the owner of the land was Begum Fazilatunnessa Mujib. According to land ownership laws, after Begum Mujib's death the land would be divided between Hasina and her sister Rehana. "In the amended statement the land will be shown in the name of the two sisters. Besides, in Dighalia there is about half a bigha farmland in the name of Sheikh Hasina. The new statement will show that," he said. Moniruzzaman added that the worth of Hasina's moveable and immoveable assets would be approximately Tk 2 crore. "According to the ACC order, the wealth statement must be submitted within seven days. But we have not yet received the verdict papers," Hasina's lawyer said. "We will give our final account after getting the proper papers. However, I hope we will be able to submit the wealth statement this week." Replying to a query Moniruzzaman said: "Sheikh Hasina is now completely well. She has no fever. However, she is feeling a little pain in her ear." Joint forces arrested Hasina at her Sudha Sadan home on July 16 in an extortion case filed by businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury. bdnews24.
