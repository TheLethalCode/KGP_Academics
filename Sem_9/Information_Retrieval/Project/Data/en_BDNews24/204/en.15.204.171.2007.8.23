 KABUL, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A German engineer kidnapped by Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan more than a month ago appeared in a video on Thursday appealing for help from the German government to secure his release. "I live in the mountains with the Taliban 3,000 metres high and the Taliban try to negotiate with the Afghan government, but the government not talk with the Taliban and the Taliban tried to get in connection with the embassy to release us, but if the time is over they want kill us," he said, speaking in English. "We live in the mountains, very high in a very bad condition, please help us," added the hostage, who was lying on a ground sheet clutching his chest and coughing in the video shown on the private Afghan channel Tolo TV. Two German engineers were kidnapped in Wardak province, southwest of Kabul more than a month ago. One of the Germans suffered a heart attack soon after and was then shot dead by his captors
