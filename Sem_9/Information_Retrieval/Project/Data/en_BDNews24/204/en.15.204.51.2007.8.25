<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Georgia's breakaway province of Abkhazia confirmed that a plane went down on its territory this week, but the identity of the plane was unclear, Interfax news agency reported on Saturday. "Most likely it was a bomber or a spy plane, which was damaged and went down in the mountains for reasons we don't know," the agency quoted the head of Abkhazia's general staff Anatoly Zaitsev as saying. Georgia said on Friday it fired at a Russian airplane after it violated its airspace and could have downed it, but on Saturday it said it had opened only warning fire.
