 Dhaka, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court rules Monday on government petitions against the High Court order granting bail to Sheikh Hasina in two extortion cases and the stay on the Anticorruption Commission (ACC) notice on her. The appeals court Sunday closed hearing on the petitions on whether it would accept appeals against in the High Court verdicts. Joint forces arrested Hasina on July 16 after businessmen Azam Jahangir Chowdhury and Noor Ali filed the extortion cases against the former prime minister. The court also completed hearing on a similar government petition against the High Court order granting bail to former FBCCI president Abdul Awal Mintoo. The six-member Appellate Division bench of the Supreme Court, headed by chief justice Md Ruhul Amin, set Monday for delivering verdict on the four "leave to appeal" petitions. Attorney general Fida M Kamal told the court during hearing the government had completed its arguments on the "leave to appeal" petition against Hasina's bail order. The court said Hasina's counsel had yet to be through with his arguments. Her counsel Barrister Rafique-ul Huq said the government petitioned hurriedly against the High Court order on Hasina's bail, which was needless since the matter could be settled in the High Court. He said the Appellate Division should not intervene at this stage. Barrister Haque said there would be no harm to the country if the Awami League chief was set free on bail. The High Court had said if she was released on bail she would not leave the country or abuse it. In the hearing of the government petition against the High Court order staying the ACC notice, the attorney general said the ACC sent the notice to Sheikh Hasina on July 17. She sought time for submitting the wealth statement and the ACC granted it. But she filed the writ petition challenging the efficacy of the notice two days before the deadline, the attorney general said. The court asked him said what would remain for the High Court to settle if the Supreme Court settled the matter of writ petition at this stage? The attorney general said the High Court had made up its mind on this matter and the government would have to accept the court order. Barrister Rafique said the ACC sent the notice illegally on July 17, one day after Hasina's arrest without following the legal procedure. The matter can also be settled in the High Court. The court then heard the "leave to appeal" petition on Mintoo's case before fixing the date for delivering the verdict. Meantime, the High Court started hearing a prayer by Hasina to quash the MiG-29 graft case against her. bdnews24.co
