 MOSCOW, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - One Russian soldier was killed and at least three were wounded when a column of troops came under attack in the southern province of Ingushetia that borders Chechnya overnight, Russian news agencies reported on Thursday. Itar-Tass said the unidentified attackers, who used guns and grenades, escaped after targeting a truck and an armoured personnel carrier carrying Interior Ministry troops. Russia has managed to subdue large-scale resistance by separatist rebels in the predominantly Muslim Chechnya region after two major wars since 1994.

Russia sent an additional 2,500 troops to Ingushetia earlier this month
