 MADRID, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The prognosis for Sevilla player Antonio Puerta is "very serious" according to doctors following his collapse and loss of consciousness during his side's league match against Getafe on Saturday. "He is in the intensive care unit where he has been given assisted ventilation and is experiencing hemodynamic instability. The prognosis is very serious," said a medical report issued by the Virgen del Rocio hospital in Seville. The 22-year-old Spanish international wingback crouched down and then fell to the ground after jogging back towards his own goal 35 minutes into the game at the Sanchez Pizjuan on Saturday night. Team mates and medical staff immediately rushed to his side and were seen preventing him from swallowing his tongue as he lost consciousness, but he was able to walk from the pitch. Doctors said that he collapsed again in the changing rooms and had to be given cardiac resuscitation before being taken to hospital. "Fortunately the club doctors and the machines managed to resuscitate him but we experienced some terrible moments because the life of the player was in danger," Sevilla president Jose Maria del Nido was quoted as saying on the club's Web site (www.sevillafc.es)
