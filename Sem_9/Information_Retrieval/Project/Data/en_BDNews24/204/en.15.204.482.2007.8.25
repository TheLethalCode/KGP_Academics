<TITLE> Hungary far right forms "guard" amid Jewish protest </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BUDAPEST, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A small group of far-right Hungarians formed a uniformed "guard" unit on Saturday amid calls by Jewish and Roma groups for it be banned, saying the body sported Nazi-era symbols. Cheered by 1,000 people in front of the presidential palace, 56 men in uniforms with red and white insignia, associated by some with the regime which sent hundreds of thousands of Jews to their deaths, swore to defend Hungary. The group was formed shortly before the first anniversary on Sept. 17 of violent anti-government protests that followed the leak of a tape in which Socialist Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany admitted he had lied to win elections. "The Hungarian Guard has been set up in order to carry out the real change of regime (from communism) and to rescue Hungarians," Gabor Vona, leader of the Jobbik party which set up the unit, told the rally. The World Jewish Congress this week asked Gyurcsany to act against the guard, which the prime minister, the governing Socialist and Free Democrat parties and a small right-of-centre parliamentary party have all condemned. The failure of the biggest right-of-centre party, Fidesz, to condemn the group has led to charges that it tacitly supports the far right. The formation of the guard comes at a time of concern over the rise of the far right in ex-communist countries following an attack this week on Indians in what used to be East Germany. Jewish groups in Hungary have complained of rising anti-Semitism and the use of symbols like a red-and-white striped flag during anti-government demonstrations last year. The flag is similar to one used by the wartime Arrow Cross regime, which murdered thousands of Jews and deported hundreds of thousands more to Nazi death camps. Its supporters say it is a medieval Hungarian flag. Jobbik, which denies it is anti-Jewish, said on Saturday that thousands of people had asked to join its guard. Both Nazi and Communist symbols are banned in Hungary, but there are vocal far-right groups in many of the nations that emerged from communism in 1989 and joined the European Union. Some observers say that with a short history of democracy and a long history of anti-Semitism in eastern Europe, there is a greater risk of these groups gaining acceptance than in western Europe. "If it (the Guard) manages to legitimise itself over the longer term... more such groups will be formed and it will cause a strong fear in the public in a (young) democracy which still needs to be developed rather than challenged," Zoltan Fleck, professor of the sociology of law at Budapest's ELTE university, told Reuters.
