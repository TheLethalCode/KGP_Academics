 CHISINAU, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Moldova's president, furious at Moscow's failure to lift a import ban on his country's wines, has ordered a halt to Russian inspections of wineries, saying his ex-Soviet state would no longer be treated as a "colony". Russia last year banned key wine imports from Moldova and Georgia on grounds that much of the production was adulterated and dangerous to consumers. Many officials in the former Soviet republics say the ban was a punishment for attempts by both governments to move out of Moscow's orbit and closer to the West. Moldovan President Vladimir Voronin and Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin have agreed the ban would soon be lifted. But Russia's Rospotrebnadzor inspectorate has pressed on with checks at Moldovan wineries with no resumption of exports. "Rospotrebnadzor will no longer be allowed into Moldova. Moldova is not a colony," Voronin told a weekend television news programme in the country wedged between Ukraine and Romania. "The mother country cannot simply come and conduct an audit of Moldovan wineries. You do not see them going to France, Italy or other countries to single out wines. What makes them think they can come here and walk around our plants?" The ban on wines has dealt a heavy economic blow to Moldova, Europe's poorest country, according to official statistics. The country of 4 million exported 300 million bottles in 2005, with revenue of $350 million, a quarter of all exports. Four out of five bottles were sold to Russia. Exports were halved last year after Russia pulled the wine from store shelves and bulldozed hundreds of thousands of bottles. Voronin has acknowledged isolated incidents of production shortfalls, but says the ban is blatantly political. The Russian inspectorate has in recent weeks authorised seven Moldovan producers to export 136 types of wine, but stringent sanitary checks have prevented shipments. Wine industry officials say they have met all demands and suggest officials from Moscow are favouring wineries belonging to Russian investors, prompting further anger among officials. Voronin, the only communist president in the former Soviet Union, irritated Russia by accusing the Kremlin of abetting separatists who have declared their own state in Moldova's Transdniestria region since 1990. He has since launched moves to join the European Union, however distant a prospect. Georgia pursues the same aim and also hopes to join NA
