 OSAKA, Japan, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World record holder Asafa Powell and American Tyson Gay are on course to meet in a 100 metres final which could be the dream match-up of the world championships on Sunday. Neither Jamaican Powell nor Gay has lost a final this season, both moved easily through the opening two rounds on Saturday and a world record is possible on the lightning fast Osaka track. Powell set the record of 9.77 seconds two years ago and twice equalled it in 2006. Gay has been the sparkplug this season. He clocked a wind-assisted 9.76 seconds in June and won the U.S. championship in 9.84 seconds, the fastest time in the world this season. Both men are seeking their first world title. Gay will also run the 200 metres and 4x100 metres relay later in the championships. Derrick Atkins of the Bahamas is the most likely outsider to gatecrash the Powell and Gay party. The heptathlon ends on Sunday with Swedish Olympic champion Carolina Kluft seeking an unprecedented third world title. She held a 148-point lead over Ukraine's Lyudmyla Blonska after Saturday's first four events. Finals in the men's 20km walk and women's shot put are taking place as well. Russian pole vault world record holder Yelena Isinbayeva also swings into action. She begins preliminary competition with hopes of breaking her record of 5.01 metres in Tuesday's final. Another defending world champion, American Lauryn Williams, opens her title defence in the women's 100 metres. Compatriot Torri Edwards, the 2003 world champion, and Olympic 200 metres gold medallist Veronica Campbell of Jamaica are expected to offer Williams stiff challenges
