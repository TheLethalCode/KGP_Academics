 LONDON, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's Ministry of Defence on Saturday named the three British soldiers killed in Afghanistan by a bomb dropped by a US aircraft coming to support them in a battle against the Taliban. The ministry named the three as privates Aaron James McClure, Robert Graham Foster and John Thrumble, from the 1st Battalion of the Royal Anglian Regiment. Two other soldiers were injured in Thursday's incident which takes to 73 the number of British deaths in Afghanistan since the Taliban were toppled in 2001. The soldiers were on a mission to disrupt Taliban activity north west of Kajaki, in the lawless Helmand province. An investigation into the incident has begun.
