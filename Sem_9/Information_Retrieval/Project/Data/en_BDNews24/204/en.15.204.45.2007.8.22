 NEW DELHI (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The government will aim to keep the widely watched wholesale price inflation rate close to 4.0 percent, Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram told parliament on Wednesday. India's wholesale price index rose 4.05 percent in 12 months to Aug 4, lower than the previous week's 4.45 percent, according to latest government data. The minister also said there would be pressure on food prices until the production of wheat, rice and pulses was stepped up.
