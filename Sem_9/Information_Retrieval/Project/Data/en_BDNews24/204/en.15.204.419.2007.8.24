 BAGHDAD, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US forces opened fire from helicopters during an overnight clash with Shia militants in western Baghdad, killing 10 people and wounding 20, police said on Friday. They said the wounded included women and children who had been sleeping on rooftops to keep cool, although the dead were believed to be gunmen. Reuters Television pictures showed cars with their windows blown out after being strafed by gunfire . Angry mourners, chanting and raising fists, took to the streets in the Shula district of the Iraqi capital, carrying wooden coffins of those killed in the clash. "We demand the Iraqi government and parliament stop the Americans interfering in Shula," local tribal elder Sabeeh al-Sharji said. "As you can see, civilians sleep on the roofs.

"Broadly accepted political compromises required for sustained security, long-term political progress and economic development are unlikely to emerge unless there is a fundamental shift in the factors driving Iraqi political and security developments," it said. Washington has dispatched an additional 30,000 troops to Iraq this year and pushed them from big bases into neighbourhood outposts in an effort to quell sectarian violence in Baghdad and neighbouring provinces. US officials say the strategy has improved security somewhat but have expressed frustration at the failure of Maliki's Shia-led government to pass laws aimed at reconciliation with minority Sunni Arabs. Sunni Arab insurgents were Washington's main enemy for most of the four years since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, but Shia militias are a growing threat and blamed for roadside bomb attacks that have killed scores of US soldiers. US forces reported that Shia militias were responsible for 73 percent of attacks on their
