 Dhaka, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com)  An explosive 74-run from Nazimuddin helped the Mashrafee XI hand a six-wicket defeat to the Ashraful XI in the high-scoring last Twenty20 practice match ahead of the ICC Twenty20 World Cup at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium Monday. The Mashrafee XI raced to 191 for four with 10 balls to spare in reply to the Ashraful XI 189 for six in 20 overs. Uncapped Nazimuddin and Junaed Siddique laid a solid foundation of 102 in 8.1 overs for the opening stand before Junaed (41 off 19 balls studded with three fours and two sixes) was caught by Saqib Al Hasan off Mohammad Ashraful. Nazimuddin then paired with captain Mashrafee Bin Mortaza adding another 50 runs off 25 balls before the opener was bowled by Saqib making a blazing 74 0ff 43 balls with the help of six sixes and five fours, leaving the side with 152 for two in 13.2 overs. Mashrafee also returned to his devastating batting with a 30-ball 45 consisting of four sixes and one four before giving a catch to Saqib off paceman Ziaur Rahman. Earlier, Ashraful opted to bat first and his side posted a challenging total riding on the fireworks from Tamim Iqbal, Alok Kapali, Saqib and Mushfiqur Rahim. Tamim and Alok put on 62 runs off just 36 balls for the opening stand before the dashing left-handed opener, Tamim, was bowled by Abdur Razzak for a 27-ball 42 studded with six fours and two sixes, and in-form Alok Kapali made the highest 57 off 36 balls hitting six boundaries and two sixes. Saqib played a 33-ball 49 smashing two sixes and three fours while Mushfiqur's 13-ball 24 was studded with two sixes and one four. The match saw a total of 28 boundaries and 10 sixes hit in both the innings though the five previous Twenty20 matches did not experience such fireworks from the batsmen. "What I wanted in the last practice match happened at last, and I am happy to see the players returning to their real form," said Ashraful. Brief score: Ashraful XI  189 for six in 20 overs (Kapali 57, Saqib 49, Tamim 42, Mushfiqur 24, Farhad Reza 4, Ashraful 0, Ziaur 0 not out, Razzak 4/30 and Mahmudullah 1/47). Mashrafee XI  191 for four in 18.1 overs (Nazimuddin 74, Mashrafee 45, Junaed 41, Aftab Ahmed 14, Nadif Chowdhury 17 not out, Mahmudullah 0 not out, Ashraful 2/27, Saqib 1/29 and Ziaur 1/46). Result: Mashrafee XI won by six wickets.
