<TITLE> Belgian government negotiator may resign - sources </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BRUSSELS, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Yves Leterme, appointed to form Belgium's next government, is considering resigning after party leaders reached an impasse over forming a coalition, well-informed political sources said. Negotiations were suspended on Friday after more than two months of fruitless coalition talks between Flemish and French-speaking parties. "We expect that Leterme will go to the King in the late afternoon," said the source. Asked to confirm Belgian media reports that Leterme would resign, the source said: "That could happen." Another source said: "It is a possibility but there are others. The king can refuse to accept his resignation. This is a crisis situation and a lot of rumours are circulating." Leterme, head of the Flemish Christian Democrat party, scooped the popular vote in a June election, but the two sides of Belgium's linguistic divide came to blows over his plans to reform the state. Some political commentators say the crisis is giving momentum to Flemish separatist parties. A spokeswoman for Leterme said when asked if he would resign: "Everything is possible." She declined to confirm the reports.
