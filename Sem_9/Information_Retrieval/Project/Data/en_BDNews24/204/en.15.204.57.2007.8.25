 TEHRAN, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iranian caretaker Oil Minister Gholamhossein Nozari said on Saturday he believed OPEC's current crude oil production was enough and did not expect the cartel to change output when it meets next month. Iran's ISNA news agency reported him saying that there was a possibility oil prices would rise. "It seems that OPEC's current production is enough and at the next meeting the current ceiling will be kept," ISNA quoted him as saying. OPEC ministers next meet on Sept. 11 in Vienna.
