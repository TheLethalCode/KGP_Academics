<TITLE> Rates on the rise for UK subprime mortgage borrowers </TITLE>

 LONDON, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UK subprime mortgage borrowers are facing a sharp rise in rates as credit market turbulence adds to pressure on funding costs, lenders and brokers said on Friday, reviving fears of increased arrears and repossessions. Many lenders in Britain's "adverse credit" sector depend on the wholesale market to fund mortgages -- through either portfolio sales or securitisations -- but recent turmoil has dried up liquidity there, pushing up the cost of borrowing. Subprime lender Kensington raised rates for its core adverse range by 0.55 percentage points last week, while Northern Rock, which originates subprime mortgages on behalf of Lehman Brothers, will next week raise rates for future borrowers by as much as 1.25 percentage points. GMAC-RFC, the UK's largest subprime lender, has also sharply raised rates, particularly for the more adverse end of the market, brokers said on Friday. "Until either the securitisation market comes back or there are other sources of funding that will allow lenders to offer mortgages at a competitive rate, they will have to tone down the volumes quite sharply," Ray Boulger, senior technical manager at mortgage broker John Charcol said. Boulger said lenders like mortgage bank HBOS's BM Solutions, which uses deposits to fund loans, are also likely to lift rates, though they will come under less pressure to do so and will be well-placed to increase volumes. "There will be quite a dramatic change in the percentage of business written by balance sheet lenders, compared with lenders who are wholesale funded," he said. Northern Rock, a prime lender which originates subprime and self-certified mortgages for US investment bank Lehman Brothers, said on Friday its increased rate was a reflection of rising prices across the market. "This is purely in the subprime sector and does not spread to our prime range," a Northern Rock spokesman said. "This pricing decision, in conjunction with Lehman, is about the competitive nature of the field and appropriate pricing in the subprime sector at present." Britain's subprime mortgage market is far smaller and far more recent than its US counterpart, dating largely from the recession of the 1990s. Subprime loans accounted for around 8 percent of lending in 2006, against 20 percent of US lending. It is also less evolved, meaning there has been less demand for more sophisticated -- and riskier -- products, while property values have also held up, against tumbling house prices in parts of the United States. But Fitch said on Friday it expects arrears and possession levels in the subprime sector to rise in the coming months, after research showed a deterioration in the second quarter from the first quarter of 2007. The rating agency said borrowers would be hit by the Bank of England's five rate rises in the past year, but also by lenders' tighter criteria, as they withdraw products and re-price others by as much as 2.5 percentage points.
