<TITLE> Income inequality widens despite falling poverty: economists </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com)  Inequality between the wealthiest and poorest segments of society in Bangladesh is widening despite steady economic growth over the last decade, speakers told a seminar Monday. Participants in the workshop also said less integrated growth in the country has widened regional disparity over the last few years. Hossain Zillur Rahman, an economist and one of the main architects of Bangladesh's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, spoke to reporters after the World Bank seminar. "Growing inequality is a major concern for Bangladesh, this has been highlighted in many areas including the HSC results published on Monday," he said. He added that urban students outperformed rural ones to an unacceptable level. According to WB data, the pace of poverty reduction in Bangladesh has recently been among the highest in the region, second only to India. Although overall poverty levels are going down, it has failed to influence income disparity between the rich and poor or between certain regions within the country. The Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) for 2005 provides data on income inequality for most countries in the world. The HIES's Gini coefficient, a measure of inequality of income or wealth distribution, reached 0.467 in 2005 from 0.451 in 2000 in Bangladesh as a whole. Their 2005 survey also found increased inequality in rural areas over the same period, while the urban figure remained steady. Dr Quazi Mesbahuddin Ahmed, a former member of the Planning Commission, told the seminar: "The government has to widen social safety nets in order to reduce the inequality gap." Dr Mahbub Hossain, executive director of BRAC, suggested a policy that decentralised much of the urban infrastructure to rural areas would contribute to a more egalitarian society. Economists stressed that although the country's physical infrastructure had improved significantly in recent years some regions still suffered irregular supply of utilities such as power and gas. Dhaka University's Dr Atiur Rahman, speaking at the seminar, said: "The government must do something for the regions lagging behind. A special policy should be adopted for pockets of poverty, such as Rajshahi, Khulna and Barisal." bdnew
