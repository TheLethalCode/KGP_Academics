 OSAKA, Japan, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ivan Tikhon of Belarus left it late to complete a hat-trick of world titles in the men's hammer with a final throw of 83.63 metres on Monday. The 30-year-old, who also won gold at the 2003 and 2005 world championships, produced the best throw of the season with his last effort to deny Slovenia's Primoz Kozmus. "It was a big fight, very tough and very emotional for me," Tikhon, who fouled on his first two throws, told reporters. "Before my last throw I said to myself I could do it.
