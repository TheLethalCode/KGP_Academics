 LONDON, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England skipper Paul Collingwood has been fined 50 per cent of his match fee for maintaining a slow over rate during his side's nine-run defeat by India in their one-day international at Bristol on Friday. The International Cricket Council's panel of match referees imposed the fine after England were ruled to be three overs short of their target in the day-night match which India won to square the best of seven series at 1-1. The rest of the team were fined 15 per cent of their match fees by match referee Roshan Mahanama. India scored 329-7, while England replied with 320 for eight. The third match is at Edgbaston on Monday
