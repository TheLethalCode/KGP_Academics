 TORONTO, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Eleven people were hurt and two are missing after a hot air balloon caught fire as it left for a sunset flight in British Columbia, sending the basket tumbling to the ground, Canadian media reported on Saturday. CBC News said the balloon caught fire shortly after it left the ground on Friday evening, and panicked passengers tried to jump to safety. The basket then plunged, like a fireball, into a nearby trailer park, destroying three mobile homes and two cars. "It ignited while they were in the basket 25 feet (7.5 metres) off the ground. It just went up all in flames," one witness told CTV television. There was no information on why the balloon, operated by Fantasy Balloons Charters in Langley, B.C., caught fire. Canada's Transportation Safety Board is investigating the accident.
