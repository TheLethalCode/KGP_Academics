 Dhaka, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com)  Law and information adviser Mainul Hosein Thursday gave a broader hint that the government might relax the curfew for a few hours for Friday prayers. In a midday phone interview from home, the adviser told reporters at the home ministry: "The curfew may relax for two hours for Juma prayers and another hour for stocking up on essentials." But there was no final decision yet, he said. Mainul spoke to the reporters by phone when they gathered in the room of the public relations officer for the home ministry on the second day of the curfew slapped on six divisional headquarters. Later in the day, bdnews24.com asked him if the government would relax the curfew on Friday, Mainul said: "I think it should be. But no decision has yet been taken." The government imposed the curfew at 8pm Wednesday to tame a wave of violence that swept much across the country. The curfew continued into a second day with a three-hour break from 4pm. The order was meant to allow stranded people some time to reach their destinations and stock up on essentials. bdnews2
