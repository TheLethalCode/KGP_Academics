<TITLE> Carew double gives Norway upset win over Argentina </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 OSLO, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)- Striker John Carew's double fired Norway to a surprise 2-1 win over Argentina in a friendly on Wednesday. Carew netted the opener on 12 minutes from the penalty spot after defender John Arne Riise had been fouled. The big frontman caused the South Americans plenty of problems and he almost struck again when he dribbled past three defenders into Argentina's penalty area only to have his shot blocked. Argentina pressed after the break but, against the run of play, Carew added a second in the 58th minute when he deftly headed in a free-kick taken by Riise. Argentina, playing their first match since a traumatic 3-0 defeat by arch-rivals Brazil in the Copa America final last month, were without playmaker Juan Roman Riquelme and defender Gabriel Heinze. With forward Lionel Messi well-shackled by Norway's defence, it wasn't until six minutes from time when Argentina pulled a goal back through Maximiliano Rodriguez. Norway have sprung back from a dreadful start to their Euro 2008 qualifying campaign and are in a three-way tie for second in Group C behind leaders Greece
