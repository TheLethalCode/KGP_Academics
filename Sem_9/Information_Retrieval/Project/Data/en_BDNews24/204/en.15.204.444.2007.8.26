 KERBALA, Iraq, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thousands of Shia pilgrims set off for Iraq's holy city of Kerbala on Sunday, demonstrating their political power and praying to be safe from bomb attacks ahead of one of Shia Islam's holiest days. Streets along the pilgrimage route were shut and Iraqi police and soldiers were out in huge numbers. "We will be victorious despite America! Anyone who is against the 12 imams will be defeated in this world and the hereafter!" shouted one youth amid a group of teenaged pilgrims chanting as they marched down Karrada Street in central Baghdad. Men and women set off on foot in brutal August heat, heading from Shi'ite districts across the capital toward Kerbala, 110 km (70 miles) to the south. Thousands more were walking from towns and cities in Iraq's mainly Shi'ite south. Many will walk for days to attend the ceremony on Tuesday and Wednesday marking the 9th century birth of Muhammad al-Mahdi, the last of 12 imams Shi'ites revered as saints. Shi'ites believe he never died and will return to save mankind. In Baghdad, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said the biggest Sunni Arab political party in Iraq had agreed to join a new alliance of moderate Shi'ite and Kurdish parties that aims to end political paralysis. The Iraqi Islamic Party of Vice President Tareq al-Hashemi had initially rebuffed overtures by the four leading parties in Maliki's government of national unity to join them, saying such alliances were not the answer to Iraq's political crisis. "Today there will be a joint statement, not from only the four parties but also the Islamic Party. There will be five parties, not four. This final statement will include a summary of all points of agreement," Maliki told a news conference. An official in the Iraqi Islamic Party's media office, however, denied the party had joined the alliance or had any plans to do so. Iraq's coalition government has been paralysed by infighting between political parties. Nearly half of Maliki's cabinet has walked out, accusing the Shi'ite prime minister of sectarianism. Shia pilgrimages have been a target of insurgents and have also served as rallying events for the country's Shia majority, now running the government after decades of repression under Sunni Arab ruler Saddam Hussein. Police said one female pilgrim was killed and six, including three children and three women, were wounded in a drive-by shooting as they passed through the mainly Sunni Doura district of southern Baghdad. Kerbala's police chief, Brigadier-General Raid Shakir, said 10,000 police officers and 5,000 Iraqi soldiers had been deployed to guard the city's four historic gates. Cars were banned from the holy city, and 500 policewomen were stationed at checkpoints to search female pilgrims, he told Reuters. Authorities did not ban cars and trucks in Baghdad itself, however, as they did for three days earlier this month during a pilgrimage to a shrine inside the capital. That pilgrimage proved peaceful with no major attacks reported. "I ask God to protect the Iraqi people. I see all this intensive security and I think it may be an over-reaction, but it is good to protect for the pilgrims," said pilgrim Ali Haidar Jassim, who made the 100 km journey from Diwaniya further south with his two brothers. The tone of the pilgrimage was largely peaceful. Police officers offered water. Well-wishers handed out fruit. One pilgrim in central Baghdad was pushing his son in a pram. "The road is safe. It is a mercy from God," said Um Maitham, an elderly woman in black traditional rob
