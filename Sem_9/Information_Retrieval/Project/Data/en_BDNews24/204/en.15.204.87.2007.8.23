 TEHRAN, Aug 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A second US-Iranian academic detained in Tehran since May and accused of espionage could soon be released on bail, a judiciary source said on Wednesday, a day after a US-based scholar was freed on bail. In cases that stoked tension with Iran's old foe, the United States, Tehran in May separately detained dual nationals Haleh Esfandiari and Kian Tajbakhsh. Esfandiari walked free on Tuesday after her family paid bail of 3 billion rials ($320,000). "There is a possibility that Tajbakhsh's arrest (status) would be changed to bail," a source in the judiciary office told Reuters. Esfandiari's lawyer had said on Tuesday she could still face trial. Iran has accused the two of involvement in what it says is a US-led plot to topple its clerical establishment in a "soft revolution". The United States has dismissed the allegation. Tajbakhsh is a consultant with the Soros Institute, founded by billionaire investor George Soros. Esfandiari works at the US Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. They were both visiting Tehran when they were detained. On Aug. 12, Iran's judicial authorities said they had completed their investigations into the two cases. A third US-Iranian, Ali Shakeri, is also being held while a fourth was released earlier on bail. Last month, Iranian television aired what were described as "confessions" by Esfandiari and Tajbakhsh, which the Foreign Ministry said had revealed a US-backed plot to overthrow Iran's rulers. The United States denounced the broadcast as illegitimate and coerced, and urged Tehran to release the detainees. On Wednesday, US State Department spokesman Gonzalo Gallegos said the US government had seen reports that Tajbakhsh may be released and was looking into them. "Our hope is, of course, that he will be released," Gallegos told reporters in Washington. Asked if the US government wanted charges against the Iranian American scholars to be dropped, he replied: "Right now, what we would like to see is them out and them able to return home, back to the United States, to their families." After her release, Esfandiari, 67, praised the prison staff and her treatment in comments aired on state television. May's detentions coincided with what rights groups and diplomats said was a fresh crackdown on dissidents. Iran dismissed accusations it is violating human rights and insisted the cases are a legal matter concerning state security.
