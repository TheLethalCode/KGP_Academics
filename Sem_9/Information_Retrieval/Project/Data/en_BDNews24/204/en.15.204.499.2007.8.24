 Dhaka, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com)  The Dhaka University acting vice chancellor, Prof AFM Yusuf Haider, Friday said he knew nothing about the whereabouts of his two colleagues detained by joint forces early Friday. "I tried to find out where the two teachers are, but I have failed," Prof Haider told bdnews24.com in the evening. The Dhaka University Teachers Association general secretary, Prof Anwar Hossain, and the dean of social sciences faculty, Prof Harun-or-Rashid, were led away by joint forces in plainclothes early Friday from their Tower Bhaban homes at Fuller Road. The families were told they would be taken to Shahbagh Police Station for quizzing. The Shahbagh Police Station duty officer said no university teacher had been taken to them. Asked whether there was any allegation against them, the acting VC said, "I don't know of any allegation against the two men." bdnews24
