<TITLE> Ghana seeks answers on Gambian migrant massacre </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ACCRA, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - What started as a dream to build a better life in Europe, ended with gunshots, machetes and death at the hands of Gambian soldiers, according to a survivor. With bullets flying overhead, Ghanaian Martin Kyere scrambled deep into Gambia's forests in the dead of night, the cries for mercy of his fellow migrants ringing in his ears. Two years on, officials from Ghana are still investigating what happened in July 2005 when eight Ghanaians planning to make the perilous journey to Europe in fishing boats were killed. Another 44 West Africans, mostly Ghanaians, disappeared and most are feared dead or languishing in Gambia's jails. "The Gambian president must release the rest or say why they were killed," said Kyere, who has spoken with one person still in a Gambian jail and believes at least 15 others were killed. A seven-member Ghanaian delegation travels to Gambia on Friday and their inquiry is due to be completed by September, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. The visit follows a 2005 agreement between Gambia and Ghana for a joint investigation but human rights groups say Gambian President Yahya Jammeh's government -- accused of imprisoning political opponents and journalists without trial in the former British colony -- has scarcely cooperated. A senior Gambian foreign ministry official said on Friday the government was not aware of the delegation's visit. "It has taken them two years to investigate this, we still don't have a report," said human rights lawyer Nana Oye Lithur, of the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI). A letter to CHRI from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, seen by Reuters, complained of the "seemingly uncooperative attitude" of the Gambian authorities and said a team from Ghana was refused permission to enter Gambia in December. Kyere, now 28, left his native Ghana in November 2004 for Senegal, hoping to board a boat from there to Europe. It is a treacherous route, undertaken in rickety wooden fishing boats. Thousands of young West Africans risk the long sea journey and possible death each year in their desperation to find work. In June 2005, Kyere agreed to pay 1,300 euros ($1,760) to make the journey with more than 50 others. The next month, he travelled by canoe to the Gambian capital Banjul to board the vessel that would take them to Europe. But on arrival in Banjul, they were arrested, split into groups, beaten and taken to police cells around the capital. One night, Kyere and seven others were bundled into a pick-up, with their hands tied. When one of them complained of shoulder pain, a soldier cut off his arm and blood spurted into the back of the pick up, Kyere said. As the pick-up went deeper into the forest, Kyere loosened his knots and jumped out. Soldiers shouted and fired in his direction. As he cowered in the woods, he heard more gunshots and cries for help. Later, he saw the truck's lights disappear as it made its way out of the forest. For six days he hid "more afraid of human beings than animals" before he made it to Senegal. "I didn't know these people would do these things," Kyere said. "If anything, I thought they might collect money and send us back. We never thought these people would kill us." Kyere finds comfort in religion although the events of July 2005 still haunt his dreams. "I dream at night and the next day I fall sick."
