 Dhaka, Aug 25 (bdnews24.com) -- A three-member panel, to discharge the responsibilities of the mayor in his absence, is to be formed in each of the six city corporations in the country, the local government adviser said Saturday. The panels are to comprise ward commissionersone of them a woman in each, according to a decision taken at a cabinet meeting at the Chief Adviser's Office. In line with another decision, all city corporation commissioners will also receive a monthly honorarium, local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal told bdnews24.com by telephone. "A three- member mayoral panel will be formed from among the commissioners at the next city corporation meeting," he said. "Keeping a woman member on the panel has been made mandatory." "If city corporation representatives fail to form a mayoral panel at the first meeting, the government will form one." "In the event that any of the city corporations fail to hold a meeting, the government will then form the new panel." Iqbal said: "Up until now there have been no honorariums for city corporation ward commissioners." "As soon as the amended ordinance comes into effect, every city corporation will give commissioners an honorarium from own funds." "However, the amount they will receive has not been fixed. City corporations will include the amount in their annual budgets, based on their own revenue earnings," the adviser said. "In these instances, government approval is essential," he said. Another adviser, who was present at the meeting, told bdnews24.com by telephone: "Today's meeting discussed law and order in some detail." "The meeting was apprised of the overall flood situation, particularly the progress of relief distribution and post-flood rehabilitation," the adviser said, requesting anonymity. The Pesticide Amendment Ordinance 2007 was approved at the weekly meeting of the council of advisers, presided over by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed. bdnews24.com/
