 NEW YORK, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Top seed Roger Federer issued an ominous warning to those rivals hoping to topple the three-times defending champion at the U.S. Open. "I'm in great shape," the world's top-ranked player told reporters. "I've had the best summer of my life. Hopefully I can repeat the win here at the U.S. Open again." Federer's words may not seem outlandish in this era of non-stop trash-talking but for the soft-spoken 26-year-old Swiss, it is a bold statement. Despite not having lost at Flushing Meadow since 2003, Federer usually enters the Open talking as if he would be fortunate to advance to the second week. The final grand slam of the year opens on Monday at the National Tennis Center with Federer the clear favourite on the men's side and top-ranked Justine Henin and defending champion Maria Sharapova as the frontrunners for the women's crown. Australian Open and Wimbledon champion Federer is hoping to become the first man to win three majors in a calendar year three times, having already performed the feat in 2004 and 2006. Among those hoping to upstage Federer are Andy Roddick and Spanish southpaw Rafael Nadal. Hard-serving American Roddick believes he might be able to repeat his 2003 run to the U.S. Open championship. "I've been hitting the ball really well in practice," said Roddick, who could face Federer in the quarter-finals. "There's no reason why I can't make a run here." NURSING INJURIES Nadal has met Federer in the finals of the last two grand slam events and although clay is clearly his best surface, he cannot be counted out on hardcourts. Henin and her Russian rival Sharapova are seeded to meet in repetition of last year's final but both have been nursing various injuries. "It's the last grand slam of the season," said Henin, who has played just one tournament since her semi-final exit at Wimbledon last month. "Everyone wants to play well here." Former champions Serena and Venus Williams would also fancy their chances even though they have barely played since Wimbledon. The American sisters will both be in action on Monday night. Number 12 Venus will face Kira Nagy of Hungary before eighth seed Serena plays German Angelique Kerber. Third seeded Jelena Jankovic and number five Ana Ivanovic of Serbia could be ready to claim their first grand slam crown if the favourites falter. Roddick said Wimbledon may have more traditions but the U.S. Open is special. "There's no tennis event like this one, with the electricity and the buzz, the tennis at night," he said
