 Dhaka, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com) - Days of curfew have taken its toll on the people who live by the day. A number of day labourers, hawkers, tea vendors and rickshaw pullers were upset since they were being forced to stay indoors with no income, no savings. They simply want an end to it. "How can I earn when there are a few people on the streets?" said Sheikh Imarat Ali, who peddles rickshaw in the capital. Friday's 14-hour relaxation was far from making him happy. "Not coming in too many numbers," Ali said of his fares who said were fewer in numbers since not many were venturing out of home. Counting the money he had earned in three and a half hours up to 1:30pm Friday, Ali said it amounted to only Tk 54. "It's way too little poor for me, I am short of Tk 200," Ali said. The elderly rickshawpuller said he had earned Tk 300 the day before the curfew began. "Today I've to pay Tk 50 for my meals since I couldn't earn for last two days," said Ali, who lives in a hut in Mohammadpur. The government Wednesday imposed the curfew in Dhaka and five other major cities to restore law and order following a wave of street violence across much of the country. But it has pushed people who need to earn daily to feed their families, up against the wall. Auto-rickshaw driver Taiyeb Ali was sullenly resentful; he was worried about whether he would be able to manage money for the next day. "I have already spent my savings. I have not enough money to buy food for the next day," Taiyeb said. "I will have to pay Tk 500 to the [owner of the auto-rickshaw]. I have only earned half of that," he said in the afternoon. "I don't know how much I will be able to earn until 7:00 pm," he said. Construction worker Mohammed Hannan, who earns Tk 120 a day, however was quite happy Friday as he would have some work. Hannan said the two-day work suspension had cut his income by Tk 240. But not everyone was complaining. "It (the curfew) has affected my earnings. But the government had imposed the restriction to stop damage to life and property. I think it's OK. We should accept it in the greater interest of the nation," said another auto-rickshaw driver Abdul Jabbar. Vendor Mohammed Mosharraf, who sells tea at Dhanmondi, did not agree with Jabbar. "Prices of essentials have already shot up. Most of the people are failing to do their daily businesses," he said. bdnews24
