 NAHR AL-BARED, Lebanon, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The families of Islamist militants battling Lebanese troops for the past three months began leaving a battered Palestinian refugee camp in north Lebanon on Friday, a military source said. "The evacuation has begun," the source said. "We announced a ceasefire to ensure the evacuation within a specific time frame." Witnesses said the Lebanese army told journalists to stay away from the area where the civilians -- 22 women and 41 children -- were to leave the camp.
