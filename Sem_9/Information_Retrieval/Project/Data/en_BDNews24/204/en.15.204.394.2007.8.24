 KIEV, Aug 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Viktor Yushchenko on Friday pledged quick action to restore presidential powers in Ukraine after an early election next month meant to end a political deadlock with the prime minister. Pro-Western Yushchenko, swept to power in 2004 on a wave of "Orange Revolution" protests against election fraud, said he was launching a "constitutional council" to proceed with changes to be approved by a country-wide referendum. He said the Sept. 30 election, intended to end a long power struggle pitting him against prime minister Viktor Yanukovich, was a chance to be seized by the country's 47 million people. "I know how to put order into our Ukrainian home. We will start by renewing the constitution," Yushchenko told a ceremony marking the 16th anniversary of Ukraine's independence from Soviet rule. "I am proceeding with the convening of a national constitutional council which will produce a new draft of the Ukrainian constitution." A draft could not be completed overnight, "but no one will be able to delay it. Nor can it be made hostage to the election as it has deep significance for the country and each one of us". Yushchenko defeated his arch rival Yanukovich in the rerun of a rigged 2004 presidential election and launched ambitious plans for Ukraine to move closer to the West and eventually join both the European Union and NATO. Yanukovich, backed in 2004 by Moscow, made a comeback in a parliamentary poll just over a year ago and was made prime minister, sparking months of clashes over a division of powers. The president dissolved parliament and called the new election. The campaign has done away with most distinctions over orientation towards Moscow or the West, with both sides promising an improvement in Ukrainians' material well-being. LITTLE CHANGE EXPECTED Surveys suggest the election will produce little change, with the prime minister's Regions Party leading and parties allied with the president close behind. Yushchenko has long sought constitutional revision to offset changes adopted by a previous parliament during the 2004 "orange" rallies. Those changes boosted the powers of parliament and the government at the president's expense. The president says politicians, academics and other prominent figures should take part in discussions. Under Ukrainian law, parliament must approve constitutional changes by a two-third vote, a considerable undertaking given the persistent divisions in the fractious assembly and the country at large. "The country wants to see a responsible system of government," he said to polite applause from a small crowd in bright sunshine outside Kiev's 11th century St Sofia cathedral. "We need effective instruments to make politicians accountable to voters." Former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, a key figure in the "Orange Revolution" now realigned with Yushchenko after a period of estrangement, wants rapid change, with a referendum held along with the election. That is almost certain not to happen. Yanukovich also favours changes, but wants these to focus on decentralisation to give Ukraine's regions more authori
