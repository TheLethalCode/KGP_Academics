 CHICAGO, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rivers from Nebraska east to Ohio climbed out of their banks on Wednesday, swollen from thunderstorms that soaked the central United States for days and killed at least eight people. The situation appeared to be worsening in Ohio where 21 counties battled high water, with officials declaring a state of emergency in nine of them in the north-central part of the state. Showers and thunderstorms were forecast in that area and in general across across the region for much of the week as a front stalled over the Midwest, setting up continued thunderstorms as cold air clashed with moisture-laden air from the Gulf of Mexico. More than 100 people were being evacuated from Findlay, Ohio, with fire and rescue crews using boats to pull people from flooded homes and businesses, Ohio Emergency Management Agency spokesman Tom Hunter said. Cars were submerged and blocks of streets were under water in several towns, and hundreds of residents had been moved to shelters in nearby counties. No injuries have so far been reported, Hunter said. "This is the worst flooding many of these communities have seen in 30 or 40 years and many, many people will have to rebuild homes and lives. Our hearts go out to the families," he said. In Iowa, Gov. Chet Culver issued disaster declarations for five counties mostly in the northwest part of the state, allowing state resources to be deployed to local communities. "Some locations are even measuring rain by the foot," the National Weather Service in Des Moines said on Wednesday as it issued a flood warning for parts of Iowa. Areas of southeastern Minnesota and southern Wisconsin were among the hardest hit. Minnesota counted seven dead in storms that began last weekend, with more rain there overnight. Wisconsin issued additional flood warnings. One person was killed in Iowa. Flood or flash flood warnings also were issued for parts of Nebraska, Illinois and Indiana. Parts of Oklahoma and Texas were cleaning up from unrelated flooding that killed more than two dozen people over the weekend after the remnants of Tropical Storm Erin moved through the area. Oklahoma Gov. Brad Henry on Wednesday asked the White House to declare three counties in his state disaster areas. "What hit the state last weekend was essentially a small hurricane, and it devastated many communities throughout the state," he said. "It is critical that we do everything in our power to see that they receive the help they need." Storms damaged nearly 500 homes in the three Oklahoma counties alone, including 42 that were destroyed and 192 that sustained major damage, he said
