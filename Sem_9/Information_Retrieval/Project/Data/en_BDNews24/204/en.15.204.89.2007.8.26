 SARAJEVO, Aug 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Turkish film about fear overwhelming a true believer when he is caught up in religious corruption has been chosen as the best movie at the 13th Sarajevo Film Festival. The jury, headed by British actor Jeremy Irons, awarded "A Man's Fear of God" (Takva) by director Ozer Kiziltan with the 25,000 euros ($33,920) Heart of Sarajevo award at the closing ceremony on Saturday night.

U.S. actor Steve Buscemi was honoured for "outstanding contribution to the art of cinema and the support to the development of the Sarajevo Film Festival". The festival showed over 170 features and short and documentary films during the past seven days. Big industry names, such as French Oscar-winner Juliette Binoche and US documentary director Michael Moore, also presented their latest films. Moore's "SiCKO" about the US health system and American greed closed the festival, with the director promising the 3,000-strong applauding audience to work to prevent the horrors of the Bosnian war happening elsewhere again.
