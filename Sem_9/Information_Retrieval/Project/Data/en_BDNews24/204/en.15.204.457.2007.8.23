 KHARTOUM, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The family of a detained Sudanese opposition leader said on Thursday he was being deprived of medical care and that his health was worsening. Mubarak al-Fadil, head of the Umma Party for Reform and Renewal, is one of 25 people detained last month and accused of plotting to overthrow the government. Some family members were allowed a supervised visit last week to see al-Fadil, who is being kept in solitary confinement. "We're all panicking. It's been 40 days now," said al-Fadil's daughter Habab Mubarak. "He hasn't seen a doctor, he could be bleeding internally, he has stomach ulcers," she said. "The conditions are disgusting (in the jail). We're disgusted and disappointed." Lawyers for al-Fadil said they were not allowed to see their client on Thursday as scheduled despite an assurance by the Sudanese government last week. "When we went to the prison authorities had no news about our coming," said lawyer Amin Mekki. He said they had been told they could visit again on Saturday. Sudanese officials have declined to say whether any of the 25 detainees, who include Ali Mahmoud Hassanein from the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), would be granted proper medical care.
