 Dhaka, Aug 23 (bdnews24.com)The interim government will serve notices on private TV stations CSB and ETV for "breaching emergency rules", information adviser Mainul Hosein said Thursday. "Several news items broadcast by the two TV channels breached the emergency rules. The notices will be served for this. The government will take action if they continue to do so," he told bdnews24.com by phone. But the adviser did not explain which news content of the TV channels had breached the emergency rules. The council of advisers held a meeting at the Chief Adviser's Office and also discussed the alleged harassment of journalists during the curfew hours, Mainul said. The government will take "necessary steps" to make sure that journalists are not harassed, he said. Asked if the government would relax the curfew for Friday prayers, Mainul said: "I think it should be. But no decision has yet been taken." bdn
