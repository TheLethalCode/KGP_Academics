 LONDON, April 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The UK's FTSE 100 index rose by midday on Tuesday, breaking a five-session losing run as AstraZeneca leapt on a patent settlement and oil shares gained on record crude prices. AstraZeneca jumped nearly 9 percent, on course for its biggest one-day percentage gain since November 2002, after the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker said it had settled US patent litigation against India's Ranbaxy Laboratories over its top-selling drug, ulcer pill Nexium. By 1023 GMT, the FTSE 100 was up 47.4 points at 5,879.0, having fallen 1.1 percent on Monday. Oil shares also rose as crude prices surged to record highs and after a large offshore Brazil find by BG Group and its partners, Petrobras and Repsol-YPF, which may be the world's biggest discovery in 30 years. BG Group rose 5.7 percent, while Royal Dutch Shell gained 1.2 percent and Cairn Energy added 2.2 percent. BP put on 0.5 percent after China had accumulated a stake of just under 1 percent in the oil major. Investors will be keen for further clues on the health of the world's largest economy, with U.S. producer price index data due at 1230 GMT. A survey showed British like-for-like retail sales fell in March for the first time in two years and at the sharpest pace in nearly three years, in a sign consumers are feeling the impact of the credit crunch. "We are seeing a lot of impact on the real economy coming in in the next six months, a lot of downgrades particularly in economically sensitive areas, consumer services and industrial particularly," said Roger Cursley, UK strategist at Investec. "We think (earnings growth) forecasts have to come down quite a bit. It'll be difficult for the market to make much headway against that," said Cursley, who cut his year-end target for the FTSE 100 to 6,250 from 7,000 on Monday. Tesco, however, said it had made a strong start to its new financial year after meeting forecasts with an 11 percent rise in annual profit. Tesco advanced 5.3 percent, while Wm Morrison Supermarkets added 1.4 percent and Sainsbury gained 1.1 percent. CARPHONE SLUMPS Carphone Warehouse slumped 12.5 percent after the company released mixed results, gave a weaker 2009 outlook and marginally revised down its 2008 full-year pretax profit. Also on the economic front, the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors reported the most widespread fall in UK house prices in March in the 30-year history of the survey, while the government said annual British house price inflation eased to a 19-month low of 6.7 percent in February from 8.0 in January. Housebuilder Persimmon dropped 2.9 percent, while rivals Taylor Wimpey and Barratt Developments both lost 3.6 percent. Diversified healthcare company Johnson & Johnson's first-quarter earnings will also provide a further gauge of the impact of the credit crisis on corporate earnings later in the day. Miners were also in demand, with Eurasian National Resources up 2.9 percent, Rio Tinto gaining 2.2 percent and BHP Billiton adding 2.1 percent. Banks were weaker, with Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, HBOS, Lloyds TSB and Alliance & Leicester dow
