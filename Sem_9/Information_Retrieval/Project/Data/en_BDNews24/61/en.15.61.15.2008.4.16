 Dhaka, April 16 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladeshi Maitree Express was on its return journey to Dhaka from Kolkata Wednesday with only 127 people on board. The first Maitree (Friendship) Express to leave for Kolkata Monday from Bangladesh, it departed Dhaka's Cantonment Station with 336 passengers aboard. The direct passenger train service between the two neighbouring countries has been restored after a break of 43 years, the last such train running in 1965. Kali Kant Ghosh, additional director (interchange traffic) of Bangladesh Railway, told bdnews24.com that 40 people out of 127 on board were ordinary passengers and the rest were government officials, journalists and guests. Of the passengers, only one was an Indian citizen. Additional director general of Bangladesh Railway Kazi Asad Ullah said many of those who went to Kolkata by Monday's train did not return by the Maitree. "Many of them returned by bus," he said. The train started for Dhaka at 7.40am BdST Wednesday from Chitpur Station in Kolkata. It reached the Indian border's Gede Station at 9.50am. About two hours were required for completing customs and immigration formalities at the station before it reached Darshana Station on the Bangladesh side at 12.10pm.
