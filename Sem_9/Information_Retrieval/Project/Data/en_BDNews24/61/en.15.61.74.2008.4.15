<TITLE> Russian envoy criticizes UN chief over Kosovo </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 United Nations, April 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia's UN envoy said on Monday that Moscow was not fully satisfied with UN chief Ban Ki-moon's stance on Kosovo but dismissed reports that his country had threatened to block Ban's re-election. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin was asked by reporters if Moscow was happy with the actions and statements of the U.N. secretary-general regarding Kosovo, which was a Serbian province until it declared independence in February. "No, we are not entirely happy," he said. "But we think that ... the secretary-general is subjected to all sorts of influences and has to take into account positions of various actors in this situation." Ban has been cautious to avoid any public statements that could be interpreted as supporting either side in the dispute over Kosovo. But diplomats say Russian officials complain that Ban's position favors Western countries that support an independent Kosovo. Russia backs Serbia, which has vehemently opposed independence for the majority ethnic-Albanian province. Churkin denied a published report saying Russia had told Ban it might not support a second five-year term for him because of his stance on Kosovo. "This is pure and simple fabrication," Churkin said. "In the course of our contacts with the secretary-general we have always clearly expressed our position, but those contacts have always been respectful," he said. "No threats, veiled or direct, have ever been made." Last week Ban made his first visit to Russia since he took up his post on Jan. 1, 2007. Diplomats said the fact he had not come sooner annoyed Russia, a permanent veto-wielding member of the U.N. Security Council with the power to block his reappointment. Ban's term expires on Dec. 31, 2011. Churkin was asked whether Russia planned to support him for a second term. "This is a matter we'll decide along with other members of the Security Council in about three years," he said. IMPASSE REMAINS The Russian envoy also reiterated Moscow's concerns about the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, known as UNMIK. "We think there is certainly room for improvement in the UNMIK operation, what is going on on the ground," Churkin said. "We are going to make our views clear to everybody." Moscow has repeatedly criticized as heavy-handed and ill-conceived a March U.N. operation to retake a U.N. court in Kosovo from Serbs who had seized it three days earlier. Officially UNMIK remains in charge in Kosovo, as has been the case since 1999, though the European Union is expected to officially take over from UNMIK on June 15. Moscow has made it clear that it would oppose any such handover of power. UNMIK's position as administrator of Kosovo has not been officially changed, because the council has been unable to pass a new resolution on the future status of Kosovo. The United States and most EU members blame Russia for the impasse over Kosovo and say a new resolution is not legally necessary. Moscow disagrees. Russia and Serbia say they will never acknowledge Kosovo's independence and have called for further talks between Pristina and Belgrade, although more than two years of negotiations had failed to result in a deal. Pristina, the United States and most EU members see no point in further talks between Kosovo and Serbia.
