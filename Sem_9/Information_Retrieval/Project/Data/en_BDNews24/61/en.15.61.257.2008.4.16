 BRUSSELS, April 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Commission is close to signing a preliminary agreement on energy cooperation with Iraq, Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said on Wednesday after talks with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. "We can very soon establish a memorandum of understanding between Iraq and the European Commission on these very important issues," Barroso, head of the European Union's executive arm, told a joint news conference with al-Maliki. He said he hoped the signing of the memorandum could be signed in a matter of weeks and that Oil Minister Hussain al-Shahristani had been invited to Brussels next month.
