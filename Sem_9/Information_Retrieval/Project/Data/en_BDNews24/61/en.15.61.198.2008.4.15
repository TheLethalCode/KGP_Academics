<TITLE> Australia call up Bollinger in place of Hilfenhaus </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SYDNEY, April 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fast bowler Doug Bollinger will replace the injured Ben Hilfenhaus in Australia's test squad for the tour of West Indies. Hilfenhaus has suffered a recurrence of a stress fracture in his lower back. "Obviously this is very disappointing for Ben," Cricket Australia (CA) chairman of selectors Andrew Hilditch said in a statement on Tuesday. "However, given the amount of cricket facing the Australian side in all forms of the game over the next 18 months, a conservative approach to the management of his back injury is best to ensure he makes a full recovery. "This presents a great opportunity for Doug Bollinger who had a great season for New South Wales until injury ruled him out of the last couple of games of the season." Left-armer Bollinger, 26, suffered a fractured foot in February but has recovered and will undergo a fitness test before taking his place in the tour party. Australia play three tests in West Indies, starting on May 22 in Jamaica
