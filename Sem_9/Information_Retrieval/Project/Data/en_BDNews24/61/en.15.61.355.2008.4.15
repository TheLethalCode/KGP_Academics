 GOMA, Congo, April 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - More than 70 people were killed when a Congolese airliner taking off from the eastern city of Goma crashed and burst into flames in a busy market district on Tuesday, witnesses and officials said. Six people -- the two pilots and four passengers, two of them children -- survived the crash of the Hewa Bora Airways Boeing 727 in Goma, capital of Democratic Republic of Congo's eastern North Kivu province, the local governor said. The Hewa Bora airliner was taking off from Goma on a flight to the Congolese capital Kinshasa when it came down in the teeming market district of Birere, a warren of single-storey shops which were crowded at that time of day. Residents heard a big explosion, which set several buildings on fire. A large plume of smoke rose from the crash site. "Half of the plane has broken off. There is a fire towards the back. People are coming with buckets of water to put out the fire. The U.N. is here trying to keep back the crowds," a witness at the crash scene said. North Kivu governor Julien Paluku told Reuters there were 79 passengers and six crew on board. "Six people have been saved, two pilots and four passengers including two children," he said. The crash was the latest aviation disaster to hit Democratic Republic of Congo, a vast country the size of western Europe which has only a few hundred kilometres (miles) of paved roads and one of the world's worst air safety records. A Congolese Red Cross official said the death toll was expected to rise, but the recovery of bodies was made more difficult by the fires raging on the ground. At least one building was destroyed by the crash. Hewa Bora Airways officials were not immediately available for comment. Last week, the European Union added Congo's Hewa Bora Airways to a list of aviation companies banned from flying in the 27-nation bloc over safety concerns. There were eight plane crashes in Democratic Republic of Congo last year, according to the Geneva-based Aircraft Crashes Record Office (ACRO). This included one in the capital Kinshasa in which an Antonov 26 plunged into a crowded neighbourhood, killing more than 50 people. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) says the air accident rate in Africa is six times worse than in the rest of the world and calls this an "embarrassment". Aviation safety experts single out Democratic Republic of Congo, which is still struggling to recover from a devastating 1998-2003 war, as one of the worst offenders. Passengers and cargo are packed onto ageing planes, often Soviet-built, which fly to multiple remote destinations across the former Belgian central African colo
