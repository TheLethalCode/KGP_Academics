 Dhaka, April 15 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh look to press on with their latest batting effort despite conceding the five-ODI series 3-0 when the visitors take on Pakistan Wednesday in the fourth match in Multan. What is encouraging for Bangladesh amid all the glooms is that the batsmen are beging to find their feet as the series progresses. Except captain Mohammad Ashraful and opener Shahriar Nafees, the top-order are in good nick with Tamim Iqbal, Aftab Ahmed, Shakib Al Hasan and Mahmudullah Riad playing good knocks. Bangladesh's coach Jamie Siddons has asked Ashraful to start performing in remaining two one-day internationals to lead the side from the front. "Ashraful is the most experienced batsman in our ranks whenever he performs the team wins and we expect that he will return to form in coming two matches to lead the side to success ", said Siddons, according to the Associated Press of Pakistan Monday. The Bangladesh captain has had a poor series so far scoring 47 runs in three innings and the coach was concerned about his performance. "The captain's role in inspiring the team is always vital and it is proven in the past that whenever Asrhaful set the tone with his bat it helps the team to get success," said the Australian coach. He asserted if Ashraful manages to put up some runs on the board, it could motivate the team to get a productive result. The 23-year old captain looked to be getting some form in the third match in Lahore but was run out for 22 despite having played himself in. "I put the heat on Shakib and Aftab (Ahmed) after Faisalabad and they responded well to it," Siddons said. "I am now putting the heat on Ashraful in the same way. I am confident he will come well in the last two matches." After the second ODI in Faisalabad, Siddons stressed the importance of top-order six batsmen  particularly Shakib, who responded with 75 in the third ODI in Lahore, taking Bangladesh closer than many thought to Pakistan. Chasing 309 to win, Bangladesh ended up at 285 for eight, the Tigers' highest second innings total as well as highest score against Pakistan. The inclusion of paceman Mohammad Asif will no doubt strengthen Pakistan's bowling attack and the Bangladesh management will hope their openers give the side a decent start and do not expose the middle-order to early. Siddons also urged his boys to learn from their mistakes and kept improving in all departments in a bid to brighten their chances of success in coming two matches. "It is time to go ahead rather than falling back. I see promise and commitment in the players to give tough time to Pakistan team, which are better in all aspects," Siddons was quoted as saying. bdn
