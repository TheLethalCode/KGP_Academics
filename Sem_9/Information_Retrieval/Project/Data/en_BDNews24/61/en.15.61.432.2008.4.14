Police have arrested at least four Islamist militants suspected of involvement in Bhutto's killing. Bhutto's aides have expressed dissatisfaction over the investigations conducted by the authorities and there has also been a controversy over the cause of Bhutto's death. British police, in their February findings, corroborated Pakistani investigators' findings that Bhutto was killed when the blast slammed her head against armour plating around the roof hatch in her vehicle, which she had stood through to wave to supporters.
