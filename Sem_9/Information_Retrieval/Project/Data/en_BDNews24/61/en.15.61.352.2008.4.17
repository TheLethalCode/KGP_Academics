 GHAZNI, Afghanistan, April 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan and U.S.-led forces killed 13 Taliban insurgents on Thursday in two separate clashes southwest of the capital, Kabul, officials said. After the traditional winter lull, violence has increased in recent weeks in Afghanistan. Ten of the insurgents died after a botched ambush against a joint Afghan and U.S.-led convoy on a highway in Ghazni province, a provincial official said. In another clash in the same province, the Afghan National Army killed three more Taliban guerrillas, the defence ministry said in a statement. There were no casualties among Afghan and foreign forces in either encounter, Afghan officials said. The Taliban could not be contacted immediately for comment. Removed from power in 2001, the Taliban Islamic movement leads an insurgency against the Afghan government and foreign troops. The al Qaeda-backed militant group has vowed to topple the government and drive out foreign troops under the command of the U.S. military and NATO. Violence has killed more than 11,000 people in the past two years, the bloodiest period since Taliban's ouster. It happens despite the presence of more than 55,000 foreign troops and some 140,000 national forces.
