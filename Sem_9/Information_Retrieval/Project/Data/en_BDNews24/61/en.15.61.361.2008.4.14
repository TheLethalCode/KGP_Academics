 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, April 14 (bdnews24.com)The long-awaited direct passenger train between Dhaka and Kolkata left for the West Bengal capital Monday morning. The first 'Maitree (Friendship) Express' left for Kolkata from Cantonment Station in Dhaka at 8.30am, with 517 passengers aboard. The direct passenger train service between the two neighbouring cities came after a break of 43 years. Of the 14-hour journey, around six hours will be required for completing customs and immigration formalities at the border stations of Darasna in Bangladesh and Gede in India, officials told bdnews24.com. A festive mood prevailed at the Cantonment Station Monday at the launch of the new passenger train service. Enthusiastic passengers from home and abroad gathered at the station from 6.00 in the morning. According to the agreement, two trains will ply between the two cities every week. On every Saturday, one train will deaprt from Dhaka and another will leave Kolkata. On Sundays, the train reaching Kolkata will depart on its return journey to Dhaka and the Indian train at Dhaka will start back for Kolkata. The minimum fare for an economy class ticket is US $8 while the fare for an AC berth is US $20 one-way. Bangladesh and India have been trying to restore a direct passenger train service between the two cities for decades, but bilateral relations had stalled the process until now. bdn
