<TITLE> Japan may face petrol shortage if tax revived: PAJ </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, April 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A top Japanese oil industry official warned on Thursday there could be a shortage of gasoline in Japan if a recently expired tax on the fuel is restored, as drivers would swarm service stations to fill their tanks before prices go back up. The retail price of regular gasoline in Japan has fallen 15 percent to its lowest level in nearly a year since the 25.1 yen a litre (about 25 cents) charge, a "temporary" tax imposed by the government three decades ago to fund road construction, expired on March 31 after a political row. The tax could be restored as early as the end of this month, around the start of Japan's "Golden Week" holidays, if the ruling Liberal Democratic Party uses its majority in parliament's powerful lower house to revive the surcharge. A revival of the gasoline tax is likely to trigger a rush among motorists, so steps will need to be taken to ensure there are stockpiles to meet essential needs, such as for hospitals and ambulances, Fumiaki Watari, chairman of the Petroleum Association of Japan (PAJ), told reporters. In addition, PAJ has asked the government to compensate gasoline stations for losses they have suffered since the tax expiry, as they have had to slash retail prices in April for fuel on which they had already paid the surcharge. The gasoline surcharge is levied when oil refiners ship products from refineries. Some analysts said Japan's gasoline demand, which fell 1.7 percent in 2007 due to the nation's peaking population and a growing preference for smaller, more fuel-efficient cars, will get a boost in the business year that started on April 1 if the gas tax is not restored. But if the tax is reinstated, that could dent gasoline sales as prices may hit record highs next month, because refiners are incurring higher crude import costs. Watari, who also serves as the chairman of Japan's biggest refiner Nippon Oil Corp, said his company was shouldering a cost increase of 2.4 yen per litre so far this month, which is likely to be passed on to gasoline prices from May 1.
