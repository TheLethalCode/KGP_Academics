<TEXT>
 LONDON, April 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United surged six points clear at the top of the Premier League with a 2-1 comeback victory over Arsenal at Old Trafford on Sunday that also snuffed out the London club's slim title hopes. Emmanuel Adebayor put Arsenal ahead early in the second half when he knocked in a Robin van Persie cross with his arm but United levelled five minutes later with a twice-taken Cristiano Ronaldo penalty after William Gallas handled. Both sides had further chances in a breathless second period but United got the winner in the 72nd minute when England midfielder Owen Hargreaves curled a free kick over the wall and beyond keeper Jens Lehmann. The result leaves United on 80 points, six clear of Chelsea, who host Wigan Athletic on Monday, with Arsenal on 71. United, who have a far superior goal difference, still have to play Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Earlier on Sunday, Liverpool tightened their grip on fourth place when superbly-taken goals from Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres and a late Andriy Voronin effort gave them a 3-1 Anfield win over Blackburn Rovers. They have 66 points to the 61 of Everton, who drew 1-1 at Birmingham City on Saturday
