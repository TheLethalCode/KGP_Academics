 MILAN, April 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Torino's new coach Gianni De Biasi will look to spoil Inter Milan's day when the leaders visit Turin this weekend while title rivals AS Roma have an easier-looking task at home to bottom club Livorno. De Biasi quit Spain's Levante on Wednesday for a third stint at Torino, who are four points above the relegation zone with five matches to play. He will hope for a quick pick-up in form against the champions on Sunday (1830 GMT) but he will be without on loan Inter playmaker Alvaro Recoba, who is suspended.

Roma beat Catania 1-0 in their semi-final first leg thanks to a thunderous shot from Francesco Totti, who is coming back into form at the right time after a number of niggles. Livorno are two points adrift of safety but will be buoyed for Saturday's match (1600) by relegation rivals Parma's 3-0 defeat at third-placed Juventus in the league on Wednesday. That win all but sealed Juve's spot in next season's Champions League qualifiers as they lead fifth-placed AC Milan by 12 points. Claudio Ranieri's side travel to Atalanta on Sunday (1300) knowing that if they better Milan's result at home to third from bottom Reggina, they will secure a qualifying spot. Stuttering Milan, Champions League winners last season, have defenders Kakha Kaladze and Alessandro Nesta back from bans but Massimo Ambrosini and Daniele Bonera are suspended with striker Alexandre Pato a doubt with a knock. Milan can still reach the Champions League qualifiers by overhauling fourth-placed Fiorentina, who have a four-point advantage and host Palermo on Saturday (1830). Sampdoria in sixth are level on points with Milan and face seventh-placed Udinese on Sunday in a crunch match in the race for Europ
