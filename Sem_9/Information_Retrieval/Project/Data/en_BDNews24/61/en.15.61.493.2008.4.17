 Dhaka, Apr 17 (bdnews24.com) -- Dhaka stocks closed down Thursday influenced in part by price adjustments in Uttara Bank shares following corporate declarations. Investors seeking to lock in profits also caused indices to drop, analysts said. Pharmaceuticals, banks, power, energy, leather and mutual funds all closed mixed, according to brokerage house officials. "Almost every sector witnessed both buying and selling today," said an official of brokerage house Prime Securities. Investors did not opt for any specific sectors, choosing instead to trade on attractive issues in pharmaceuticals, banks, power and energy, and leather, he said. "However, selling outstripped buying due mainly to sell offs in mutual funds," the official added.
