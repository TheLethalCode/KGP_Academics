<TITLE> UK's Brown to push economic credentials on US trip </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, April 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The global financial crisis looks set to dominate British Prime Minister Gordon Brown's trip to the United States this week as he struggles to boost his slumping popularity and confidence in his economic stewardship. Faced with the prospect of a house price crash and the sharpest drop in a leader's personal poll ratings since World War Two, Brown has been anxious to show he is in control of the economy he managed for a decade as finance minister. He met with London financiers on Tuesday to consult them on more action to help ease the strains caused by a global credit crunch that has now raged on for 8 months because of crashing U.S. real estate prices. "We have been working with the Governor of the Bank of England for some time ... We are doing so in consultation with financial institutions and today's meeting was part of that process," his spokesman said. The prime minister will later fly to the United States to meet senior Wall Street bankers on Wednesday to discuss the global credit crunch that has now raged on for eight months because of crashing US real estate prices. He will likely press them to make full and prompt disclosure of their losses on risky U.S. mortgage debt. Analysts say this could help to get banks lending to one another again and bring down borrowing costs for hard-pressed consumers and businesses. Campaigning this week for local elections on May 1 -- his first electoral test since taking over from Tony Blair since last June and where his ruling Labour Party is expected to take a beating -- Brown said the economy was now his "sole focus". "Every effort of mine, every day that I wake up is about keeping this economy moving forward," he said. With Labour politicians increasingly worried about their own fortunes, there have been growing challenges to his authority and speculation has increased that someone might emerge to challenge Brown for the leadership. On Tuesday, trade minister Digby Jones, appointed by Brown from a business rather than a political background, was reported in a newspaper as saying he would quit before the next national election because he was not prepared to support Labour. There has also been growing disquiet over the scrapping of a 10 percent tax band that helped low earners but analysts say a challenger still remains unlikely. Brown, himself, is banking on an economic rebound next year to revive his ratings in time for a national election which must take place by 2010. He argues that Britain is well-placed to withstand the global slowdown and is predicted to be the fastest-growing economy in the Group of Seven. GRIM NEWS But the economic news on Tuesday was grim. One report signalled a sharp downturn in the housing market with a record proportion of surveyors saying prices were now falling. Another showed retail sales dropping at their sharpest annual rate in nearly three years and official figures showed inflation well above the central bank's target as food and energy prices keep rocketing. That will make it harder for the Bank of England to cut interest rates as sharply as the U.S. Federal Reserve. In any case, mortgage lenders are not passing on the central bank's three quarter-point rate cuts since last December. Finance minister Alistair Darling will meet the main lenders next week to urge them to do more to help homeowners in a country where house prices are a national obsession as more than two-thirds of households own their homes. Brown, who will meet with PrEsident George W Bush on Thursday, will also call for action to bring down soaring food and energy prices, which are not only boosting inflation in rich countries but also causing riots in developing nations. Besides the global crisis that has put the United States on the brink of recession, the two leaders are likely to discuss troop numbers in Iraq and the situation in Afghanistan. Brown is also expected to meet presidential hopefuls Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and John McCain and renew his call for reform of the international institutions such as the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund. But notwithstanding his appearance on television talent show American Idol, the 57-year-old Scot's trip will likely be eclipsed in the U.S. media by the visit of Pope Benedict XVI in the same we
