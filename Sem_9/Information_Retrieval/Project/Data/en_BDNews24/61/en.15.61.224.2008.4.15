 Stephen Brown and Silvia Aloisi ROME, Apr 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Conservative billionaire Silvio Berlusconi won a third term as Italy's prime minister on Monday with an unexpectedly strong mandate to deal with deep economic and social problems. Centre-left rival Walter Veltroni conceded defeat after early results from a two-day election projected a big majority in both houses of parliament for the 71-year-old media magnate. "I called the leader of the People of Freedom (PDL), Silvio Berlusconi, to acknowledge his victory and wish him luck," the 52-year-old former mayor of Rome told reporters outside his party's headquarters. Berlusconi, who has vowed to cut taxes and rein in Italy's huge debt, had been widely expected to win the lower house. But a strong Senate majority would help him push through structural reforms needed to pull Italy away from the brink of recession. Many Italians are deeply disillusioned with politics and doubt any government can quickly cure the ills of the European's Union's fourth-largest economy. Pollsters' projected results, based on early results, gave Berlusconi a 99-seat majority in the 630-member lower house and an advantage of at least 22 seats in the Senate, which has 315 elected and seven lifetime senators. That contrasts with the two-seat majority in the Senate that the last government had under Romano Prodi. Berlusconi had set his sights on a 20-seat majority in the Senate. His spokesman, Paolo Bonaiuti, called it a "clear and decisive turnaround after the disastrous leftist government" which collapsed in January after 20 months in office.
