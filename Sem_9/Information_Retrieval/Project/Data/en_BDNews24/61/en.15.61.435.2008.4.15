<TEXT>
 LONDON, April 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British department stores group Debenhams Plc reported lower first-half profits ahead of consensus but warned that the outlook remained challenging as UK shoppers tighten their belts during the credit squeeze. "It is a tough market; consumer confidence is low," Chief Executive Rob Templeman told a conference call, blaming it on the credit crunch, rather than the economy. "I think it's more a liquidity factor and some inflation making the consumer feel a bit lower. But the liquidity (situation) in the banking market arose very quickly. I think it could come back very quickly," Templeman told reporters. Earlier, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said UK like-for-like retail sales fell in March for the first time in two years and at the sharpest pace in nearly three years, a sign consumers are feeling the impact of the credit crunch.. Indebted shoppers have cut back on spending, under pressure from a cooling housing market and higher energy and food bills. The retailer, which runs around 145 stores across the UK and Ireland, said headline pretax profit fell 12.4 percent to 94.1 million pounds ($185.9 million) for the six months to March 1, down from 107.4 million the previous year. Templeman told reporters the consensus for profit had been around 92 million pounds. When reporting lower first-half sales in March, the company had said profit would meet expectations. Debenhams' shares, which have underperformed the UK general retailers' index by around 40 percent in the past 12 months, were 2.2 percent higher at 58.25 pence by 1015 GMT, valuing the company at around 500 million pounds. "There may be some relief today that Debenhams has delivered in-line with our expectations, particularly as the BRC suggests that March was very difficult," Landsbanki analyst Charles Nichols said in a note. "However, we remain cautious," said Nichols, who has a "reduce" rating on the stock. Debenhams returned to the stock market in May 2006 at 195p a share, but has slumped since amid poor trading conditions. "Clearly, the market is taking the view that Debenhams is broken and, like Humpty Dumpty, can't be put back together again," Panmure Gordon analysts said in a note. "Yes, it has high debt, but we have regard for the management team and think that the shares reflect the gloomy short-term scenario, but not a return to profit growth," they said, keeping a "Buy" rating and 80p price target on the stock. CURRENT SALES DIP "The bad news is that we don't think that market conditions are set to get any better very quickly," Panmure said, adding Debenhams was, even so, gaining market share in all clothing categories. Like-for-like sales fell 0.7 percent in the first half but this accelerated to show a slide of 1 percent when including the first six weeks of the second half. Templeman said like-for-like sales had improved in the first four weeks of the second half, but then fell by 2-2.5 percent in the latest two weeks to April 12. Debenhams held the interim dividend at 2.5 pence, but said net debt had fallen by 37.2 million pounds to 979.3 million as at March 1. "I expect our debt position to improve even with the investment going into the business going forward," Templeman told reporters. Capital expenditure on new stores and refurbishments is still expected to be around 140 million pounds this year, but Templeman said it would be in excess of 100-110 million ne
