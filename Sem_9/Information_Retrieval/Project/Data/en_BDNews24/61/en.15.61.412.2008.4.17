 Dhaka, April 17 (bdnews24.com) - The proceedings of a graft case against detained former prime minister Sheikh Hasina were interrupted for two hours Thursday, as journalists continued their earlier boycott of the courtroom in protest of rough treatment by police officials. Journalists had initially boycotted the hearing, at Judge Md Firoz Alam's Special Judge's Court-1, two days earlier following the rude behavior of two police officials with a reporter over seating in the courtroom. As the journalists refused again on Thursday to enter the courtroom, set up on the Sangsad Bhaban premisesgathering news of the hearing instead from outside the courtHasina had said: "If the journalists are not present in the court, it will not be an open trial but an 'in camera' trial." "If the journalists do not come back, we will not take part in hearing," the former prime minister said. Judge Alam then suspended the day's proceedings for almost two hours from 10.45 am, saying: "The journalists have been working here for the last one year, since this court was set up." "They are informing not just the people of our country but the whole world about our work here. It is our duty to arrange proper seating for them." After the day's proceedings had resumed, Judge Alam adjourned the hearing till Apr 21. Hasina had been brought to the court from the nearby special jail in the morning to face charges in the case involving 'illegal contracts' for setting up three barge-mounted power plants during her term as prime minister. Thursday marked the fifth day of the hearing on charge-framing, which began on Apr 3. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case with Tejgaon police on Sept 2, 2007, naming eight people including Hasina. The antigraft body accused the former prime minister and the others of being involved in the exchange of Tk 3 crore in bribes from Wartsila Power Development Limited Consortium's local representative, and Summit Group and United Group representatives, for awarding the contracts to set up three power plants in Khulna, Shikalbaha and Haripur. Others accused in the case are former power secretary Toufiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, former chairman of the Power Development Board Nooruddin Mahmud Kamal, Summit Group directors Md Aziz Khan and Farid Khan, United Group directors Hasan Mahmud Raja and Abul Kalam Azad, and curator of Bangabandhu Memorial Museum Syed Siddiqur Rahman. Of the accused, Hasina and Toufiq-e-Elahi are currently behind bars. bdnews24.co
