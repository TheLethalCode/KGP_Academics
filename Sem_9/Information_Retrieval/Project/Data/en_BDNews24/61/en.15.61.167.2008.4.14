 Dhaka, Apr 14 (bdnews24.com)The Indian 'Maitree (Friendship) Express', which departed Kolkata for Dhaka at 7.10am Monday, crossed the border into Bangladesh just before 5pm, bdnews24.com's Kolkata correspondent reported. The first direct passenger train from Kolkata to Dhaka after a break of 43 years crossed paths with its Bangladeshi counterpart which departed Dhaka's Cantonment Station at 8.30am for Kolkata. The Indian train was stopped briefly by protestors in West Bengal's Nadia district near the border's Gede Station before crossing into Bangladesh. The train was detained by customs officials for almost two hours, but passed rapidly through immigration checks, bdnews24.com's correspondent reported from aboard the train.
