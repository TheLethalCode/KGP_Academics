<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 17 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has set a final hearing for Sunday on crucial pubic interest litigation that seeks national elections in a "legitimate timeframe" from the dissolution of parliament. The bench of justices MA Rashid and Ashfaqul Islam fixed the date after barrister Masud Reza Sobhan sought the final hearing on the petition Thursday. Barrister Sobhan filed the public interest litigation on Jan 24 last year. On Jan 27, the court issued a rule nisi asking the Election Commission to explain why an order would not be passed to hold the polls in a "legitimate timeframe". The HC also asked the chief adviser, EC secretary and law secretary to explain why failure to hold the polls in 90 days from the dissolution of parliament would not be declared unlawful. Sobhans's lawyer Saiful Islam Thursday told reporters that the HC bench led by justice Shah Abu Nayeem Muminur Rahman had fixed March 19 for a final hearing on the petition. But chief justice Md Ruhul Amin in an administrative order had stripped the judge of powers to hear writ petitions and the issue had been transferred to the bench of justices Rashid and Islam. bdnew
