<TITLE> US sees food aid on track despite high costs </TITLE>

 Kansas City, Mo., April 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An injection of wheat into U.S. food aid stocks may help keep donations on track this year, a top official said, but the future is precarious as world hunger grows and high crop prices eat into aid budgets. On Monday, the Bush administration announced it would release valuable wheat stores from an emergency crop trust in an effort to staunch the deepening food crisis that has brought protesters onto the streets from Cameroon to Indonesia. The wheat released from the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust, worth about $200 million in crop and shipping costs, was a windfall for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the body that had been grappling with a shortfall of at least $265 million for the current year. "It will be an ongoing challenge for this year to get food to the most vulnerable populations," Henrietta Fore, the agency's administrator, said in an interview. Still, Fore and other USAID officials said the wheat, along with $350 million in emergency funding it hopes will be approved soon by Congress, should be enough to avoid feared reductions in food aid deliveries in 2008 -- barring any new surges in food prices or fresh aid needs triggered by famine, war or natural disasters. The funding quandary faced by the United States, the world's largest provider of food aid, is echoed across the globe as donors' budgets are able to buy less and less food. The United Nations' World Food Program has been seeking an extra $500 million to help it avoid cutbacks this year. Since early 2005, global food prices rose by at least 80 percent, the World Bank says, driven by mounting biofuel production, higher incomes in major emerging economies, volatile weather and new commodities investments. At the same time, oil prices have reached record highs, increasing the cost of shipping. More costly staples, which experts predict will linger for several years at least, have triggered protests and violence in a growing list of developing countries. Haiti even ousted its prime minister after food-related riots. U.S. President George W. Bush, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and World Bank President Robert Zoellick have called in the last week for urgent steps to reverse the crisis. "There are too many people that are finding that food is not available or not affordable. As a world we would like to see a system that is working in a more equitable fashion," Fore said during a visit to Kansas City for an annual food aid conference. Against this worrying backdrop, U.S. officials, lawmakers and aid groups are quarreling about the best way to use the $2 billion the United States spends on food aid each year. Congress is debating changes to aid policy in the 2008 farm bill, the umbrella farm law now stalled for months. The Bush administration has been pushing one change that would allow the purchase of some food aid in the developing world, rather than using U.S. crops, to save on shipping costs and get aid to crisis zones more quickly. So far, the proposal has found little support in Congress. In the short run, though, all eyes will be on food aid funding in fiscal 2008 and 2009. Mark Keenum, the Agriculture Department's top official for foreign agriculture and food aid, said it was too early to say whether more wheat would be released from crop trust this year.
