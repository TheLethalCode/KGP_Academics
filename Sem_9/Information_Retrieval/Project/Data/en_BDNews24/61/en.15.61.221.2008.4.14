 MANCHESTER, England, April 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Eighteen world records tumbled at the world short-course swimming championships but the dizzying action gave only limited insight into what to expect at August's Olympics beyond another record glut. Fine champions such as Kirsty Coventry and Ryan Lochte gave a vivid demonstration of talents which will illuminate the Olympics in Beijing's 'Water Cube' swimming stadium. But many of their elite fellow swimmers, including Michael Phelps, Libby Trickett (nee Lenton) and Laure Manaudou, were far away working on their preparations for Beijing or gearing up for national Olympic trials. The frenetic action in the 25-metre short-course tank, with the emphasis on explosive turning power, is also very different from the demands of the Olympic-sized 50-metre long-course pool. The five-day championships offered plenty of excitement and a deluge of world records in a year which has been awash with new standards set, for the most part, in a controversial new space-age bodysuit. All 18 Manchester records fell to swimmers wearing the Speedo LZR Racer suit. Thirty-nine world records have been blown away since mid-February and 18 of 19 new long-course marks plus 18 of 20 short-course records have featured the suit. Other swimwear manufacturers, contending that the suit had properties infringing the sport's rules, had talks at the weekend with swimming's world governing body FINA to clarify what is allowed and FINA said all suits it had approved -- which includes the LZR Racer -- complied with its specifications. Lochte and Coventry led the record spree, each claiming three individual world marks and Lochte adding another in the U.S. 4x100 freestyle relay. Lochte broke the 200 individual medley world record and twice lowered the time for the non-Olympic 100 individual medley at a meet in which he swam a multitude of events. He bagged gold in the 100, 200 and 400 medley and 4x100 freestyle relay and silver in the 200 backstroke and 4x100 medley relay "Breaking records is a big confidence boost, especially at the point where I'm at in my training right now," Lochte, world long-course 200 backstroke champion and world silver medallist behind Phelps in the 200 and 400 individual medley, said. Coventry, the Olympic 200 backstroke champion, was similarly prolific. She claimed gold in the 100 and 200 backstroke and 200 and 400 individual medley and bronze in the 100 medley and set world records in the 200 and 400 medley and 200 backstroke. "I was really always surprised (by my performances). I've not swum short-course metres in four years," the Texas-based Zimbabwean told reporters. Marleen Veldhuis also excelled in Manchester, winning four golds in the 50 and 100 freestyle and Dutch 4x100 and 4x200 freestyle relays and breaking world records in the 50 and the two relays. Croatia's Olympic silver medallist Duje Draganja boosted his Beijing credentials with a 50 freestyle world record and double Olympic silver medallist Markus Rogan of Austria halted Lochte's winning run when he snatched the American's 200 backstroke world record and title in another superb swim
