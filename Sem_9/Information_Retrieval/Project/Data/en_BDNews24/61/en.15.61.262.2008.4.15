 Rajendrapur, April 15 (bdnews24.com)Peacekeepers taking part in a peace support operations exercise have stressed the need for training to help them play a significant role in keeping world peace in an age rattled by the threat of terror. Exercise Shanti Doot-2 began on April 1. The training being held at the Bangladesh Institute of Peace Support Operations Training (BIPSOT) has been designed to show the difference between success and failure in future peacekeeping operations, said Brigadier General Saiful Ali, BIPSOT commandant, Tuesday. "When these soldiers leave BIPSOT, we want them to be trained competent peacekeepers that will discharge their duties and remained calm when attacked and composed under provocation," Ali added. Lieutenant colonel Edward Tanguy of the US army said: "Our efforts will enhance the availability and capability of these countries to participate in UN regional and worldwide peacekeeping operations." For three weeks, more than 400 soldiers from 10 countries have been training at the BIPSOT in Rajendrapur Cantonment, according to a statement issued Tuesday. "The Bangladesh people have been hospitable and extremely friendly," said Corporal Amir Biy Hj Tlidup of the Royal Brunei Army. The scenarios at BIPSOT have been based on real-life incidents, which add to the realism of training, said Sgt Mazlan Hj Abd Halim, also from Brunei. Lieutenant Sunil Soni of Indian army said: "Peace has become a vital need in today's world. No place in the world has been devoid of terror, so to maintain peace and to make the world a better place, peacekeeping is necessary." The interaction with other nations and showing of experience has certainly been wonderful and of much use, Sunil Soni said. Captain Mohammad Noman of Bangladesh Army said: "The training is important and essential." He said Bangladesh peacekeepers were preparing to join a peacekeeping mission in the Ivory Coast by August.
