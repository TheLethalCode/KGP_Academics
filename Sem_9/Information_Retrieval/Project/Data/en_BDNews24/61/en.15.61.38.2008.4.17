<TITLE> Indonesia raises alert for Java volcano </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JAKARTA, April 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indonesian authorities have raised the alert level for a volcano near the country's third largest city following increased volcanic activity, a volcanology centre official said on Thursday. More than 100 volcanic tremors were recorded from Mount Papandayan in West Java on Wednesday, although there were no visible signs it would erupt soon, said Estu Kriswati from the volcanology centre in the nearby city of Bandung. "The volcano has shown increased activity since April 9 but it reached its peak yesterday," she said. Scientists have raised the alert to yellow, two notches below the highest red alert. Papandayan, a popular tourist site, last erupted in 2002, emitting ash and sending mud down its slopes but causing no casualties. A 1772 eruption destroyed villages and killed about 3,000 people. Indonesia has the highest number of active volcanoes of any country, sitting on a belt of intense seismic activity known as the "Pacific Ring of Fire". People often live and farm on the slopes of volcanoes because of the rich volcanic soil. On Tuesday, about 600 people were evacuated on Flores island in eastern Indonesia after Mount Egon volcano began spewing ash and authorities raised the alert to orange, one level below the highest level. In the past two years, at least three volcanoes in Indonesia -- Mount Merapi, Kelud and Anak Krakatau -- have shown signs of activity, but all are relatively quiet now
