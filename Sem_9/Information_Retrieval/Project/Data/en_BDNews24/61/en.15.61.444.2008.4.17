<TITLE> Valencia to celebrate Cup win after league safety assured </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MADRID, April 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - King's Cup winners Valencia have put their celebrations on hold until after they have secured their Primera Liga safety, club president Agustin Morera said. Valencia put a miserable few months behind them to beat Getafe 3-1 at the Vicente Calderon on Wednesday to claim their seventh King's Cup. But with only five points separating them from the relegation places with six games to go in the league, this Sunday's trip to face Athletic Bilbao has been given priority. "We are going to take it calmly. We have to return to Valencia and start preparations for the Bilbao game because we still have work to do in the league," Morera told reporters. "In principle, we'll postpone the festivities and when everything is a little more settled we'll all celebrate it together." Getafe's nervous start allowed Valencia to take a two-goal lead through Juan Mata and Alexis inside the opening 12 minutes, which secured them an advantage they were happy to sit on. Esteban Granero pulled one back from the penalty spot just before the break and the Getafe midfielder rattled the crossbar near the end, but Fernando Morientes' opportunist header sealed the victory seven minutes from time. Under-fire Valencia coach Ronald Koeman's future has been the subject of much media speculation in the last few days and he has been barracked by fans at recent matches. NO FLUKE Winning them a trophy to celebrate failed to win over all the Valencia fans. As the team paraded the cup afterwards, some supporters could be heard chanting for him to leave. "I didn't hear them well. I wasn't sure if they were telling me to stay or go," Koeman said in the post-match press conference. "No one has said anything to me about my future. It isn't in my hands. If they want to tell me something I'll be at home tomorrow afternoon." For Getafe, it was a second consecutive King's Cup final defeat after losing last year's 1-0 to Sevilla. This new setback came just six days after their valiant ten-man display against Bayern Munich in the UEFA Cup quarter-finals, which saw them put out on the away goals rule. That performance won the hearts of many neutrals for the cup final and even the Valencia supporters chanted the club's name as they went to collect their losers' medals. "In only four years in the top flight Getafe have reached two cup finals, and have done very well in their first UEFA Cup campaign," Getafe coach Michael Laudrup said. "This team has demonstrated that last year was no fluke and I see no reason to believe it should all end here.
