 Sumon K Chakrabarti Mumbai, April 17 (bdnews24.com)He is not only India's most-wanted criminal but also carries a global terrorist tag. Dawood Ibrahim Kaskar, who is responsible for the 1993 serial blasts in Mumbai that killed over 300 people, has eluded the Interpol for all these years. Over the years the dreaded gangster has acquired a larger-than-life image with more rumours to his credit than any actor in Bollywood. After Dawood fled to Karachi in Pakistan speculations were rife that he had undergone plastic surgery to evade detection. Declared a global terrorist by the US with an Interpol red notice against him, Dawood is known for holding many passports. But after months of investigation, bdnews24.com has found that the don travels by the name of Shaikh Abdul Rehman on a passport issued from a tiny western African nationformer French colony of the Republic of Mali. Dawood's passport number is A 1332945 issued on April 6, 2005. It shows how Dawood has not really undergone plastic surgery as many had suggested. Instead he has begun sporting a French beard. The passport has been used in such a clandestine manner that even the Interpol is not aware of its existence. It is believed that the don also uses a Pakistani passportH 123259issued in Rawalpindi, Pakistan in July 2001. In this passport, Dawood calls himself Md Anees, and this passport also does not register on the Interpol watch list. "All references to this passport had been hushed up. For the past three years, Dawood and his people as well as his protectors in the Pakistan establishment, have been able to keep this passport closely guarded," says Joginder Singh, former chief of India's Central Bureau of Investigation. The gangster has 29 passports from several countries including, Belgium, Burkina Faso, Azerbaijan and Mauritius among others. The Interpol red notice lists 11 of his Indian passports, but he apparently does not use them anymore. His new passport was made so that he could travel easily in African countries and his business in narcotics could spread though Africa and Europe. The gangster has operated with impunity across countries to leave an indelible stamp of his reach and influence all over the world. The investigation also shows that Dawood might have been branded a global terrorist by the US in 2003 but he is still managing to sneak out of Pakistan and return to his hideout in Karachi time and again. Despite being linked to Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, Dawood's present investments total more than $700 million. India's English news channel CNN-IBN reports that Dawood has invested in a textile company in Tanzania and is now under the scanner for funding terrorist organisations. He has set up a drug smuggling base in South Africa and is an hotelier in Kenya and Nepal. He has put money in an airline also. Dawood is part of the illegal small arms trade in Thailand and Hong Kong. But in Africa, it is the Mandrax pill which has become Dawood's latest passion. Mandrax comes in from everywhere, even the sub-continent to South Africa which is the hub of Dawood's drug business. From South Africa, the drug moves to countries like Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and then onwards to Nigeria and further north to Morocco. From there, not just drugs, Dawood's expensive narcotics shipments travel to Europe and often to Canada. The investigation also establishes that Dawood's henchmen from Iqbal Mirchi to his brother Anees Ibrahim are all doing well. The Indian government's attempts to initiate a coordinated move against Dawood with the support of other countries including the US and Pakistan have not yielded results.
