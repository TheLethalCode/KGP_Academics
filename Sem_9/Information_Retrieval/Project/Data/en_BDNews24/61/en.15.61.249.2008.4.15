After signing for Sao Paulo last December, he promised to turn over a new leaf, only to be photographed at a pop concert in Rio de Janeiro holding a beer can two days later. A week later, he was involved in a car accident in Rio. Although nobody was injured, it happened in the early hours of the morning, raising more suspicions he had been out on the town. In February he was fined 40 percent of a month's wages after arriving late for training, then leaving early and threatening a cameraman
