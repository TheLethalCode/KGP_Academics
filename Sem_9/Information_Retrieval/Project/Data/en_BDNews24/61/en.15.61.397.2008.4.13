 Dhaka, April 13 (bdnews24.com)The Awami League Sunday demanded the release of its detained chief Sheikh Hasina in "informal" talks with five advisers in the lead-up to dialogue, an AL leader said. The cabinet members held the talks with AL leaders, starting at 6:15pm at state guesthouse Meghna. After the meeting, acting AL general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam told reporters that they had demanded freedom of Hasina, one of the pressing issues discussed at the meeting. They also asked the government to rein in the prices of commodities, lift the state of emergency and announce a date for parliamentary polls and try war criminals, the AL leader said. On the dialogue, Ashraful said: "We told the advisers that the formal dialogue would be bilateral as well. The chief adviser must be present at the dialogue. None other than the caretaker government advisers can be present at the formal talks." Awami League presidium members Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury led the team. Other members of the AL team are Amir Hossain Amu, Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed, Suranjit Sengupta, Motia Chowdhury and Ashraful. The government representatives are law adviser AF Hassan Ariff, communications adviser Ghulam Quader, foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury, LGRD adviser Anwarul Iqbal and commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman. The talks are crucial as they are meant to narrow the gap between the government and political parties. bdnews
