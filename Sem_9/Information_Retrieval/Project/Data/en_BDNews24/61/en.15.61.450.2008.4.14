 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, April 14 (bdnews24.com) Rail communication between Dhaka and Kolkata was established Monday after 43 years, with the rolling out of the Maitree (Friendship ) Express service. The long-awaited direct passenger train to Kolkata left Dhaka's Cantonment Station for the West Bengal capital at 8.30am, with 517 passengers aboard, reaching Darshana at 2.20 pm. Its counterpart, the Indian Maitree Express, departed Kolkata for Dhaka at 7.10am Monday, crossing the border into Bangladesh around 4pm. Strict security measures were taken on the inaugural runs of both friendship trains. Of the 14-hour journey, around six hours will be required for completing customs and immigration formalities at the border stations of Darasna in Bangladesh and Gede in India, officials told bdnews24.com. A festive mood prevailed at the Cantonment Station Monday at the launch of the new passenger train service. Enthusiastic passengers from home and abroad gathered at the station from 6.00 in the morning. Communications adviser Ghulam Quader, foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury, local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal, education adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman and Indian high commissioner Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty were among those present at the station to wave off the Maitree Express. Ghulam Quader told bdnews24.com: "It is a historic day for Bangladesh and India. The train link will strengthen the friendly relations between the two courtries." The foreign adviser said: "The start of the train service on Pahela Baishakh (the Bangla New Year) is a good start." Hossain Zillur Rahman said bilateral relations could only improve through the newly restored rail link. Indian high commissioner Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty, who was to travel aboard the train to Kolkata, said: "This is a historic moment for us. In future more such trains will be introduced." Writer Imdadul Haq Milon, another passenger on the inaugural train journey, said the train link would increase cordiality among the people of the region. According to the agreement, two trains will ply between the two cities every week. On every Saturday, one train will depart from Dhaka and another will leave Kolkata. On Sundays, the train reaching Kolkata will depart on its return journey to Dhaka and the Indian train at Dhaka will start back for Kolkata. The minimum fare for an economy class ticket is US $8 while the fare for an AC berth is US $20 one-way. Bangladesh and India have been trying to restore a direct passenger train service between the two cities for decades, but bilateral relations had stalled the process until now. The direct rail link snapped during the Indo-Pakistan war of 1965. Three decades after the liberation of Bangladesh initiatives were taken to restore the rail service in 2001. The two countries finally signed a formal agreement on April 11 this year. Additional secretary of the communications ministry ATKM Ismail, Bangladesh Railway additional director general Quazi Asadullah and journalists were among the passengers on the inaugural run of the Bangladesh Maitree Express. bdnews
