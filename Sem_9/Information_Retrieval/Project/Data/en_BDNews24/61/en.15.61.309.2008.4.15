 LONDON, April 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Gordon Brown said on Tuesday his main economic challenge was to prevent a repeat in Britain of US-style rising unemployment and mortgage repossessions caused by the global credit crunch. In an interview on Sky Television, Brown, whose government is under attack from opposition politicians who say it is losing control of the economy, said he was working to ensure that the problems facing the US economy, where falling real estate prices are slowing growth and creating job losses, were not repeated in Britain. "The challenge is to prevent what has happened in America -- where you have large numbers of foreclosures and larger unemployment -- from coming across to Britain," he said. "(We must) make sure that we can give people the confidence that mortgages will be safe and that we are in a position to steer the economy through difficult circumstances." He said the credit crunch has forced a "global period of adjustment". "We are doing everything in our power to make sure that we can underpin the housing market and the economy with greater confidence." Brown, who is due to fly to the United States on Wednesday for talks with U.S. President George W Bush and top Wall Street bankers, said he planned to discuss collective action to bring down oil prices. "One of the reasons I am going to America... is that I believe we can take action collectively to get oil prices down," he told Sky. "We are not producing enough oil ... and we can take collective action to persuade OPEC and others to get the oil price down." British Finance Minister Alistair Darling, who is on a visit to China, said both the government and the Bank of England would continue to offer support to troubled financial markets. Both men noted that the BoE had been providing extra liquidity to money markets, with an extra 15 billion pounds of three-month funds on Tuesday bringing the total assistance so far to around 50 billion pounds. Economic data released on Tuesday signalled a sharp downturn in the housing market with a record proportion of surveyors saying prices were now falling. Another report showed retail sales falling at their sharpest annual rate in nearly three years. But Darling said the drop in housing market sentiment to a 30-year low had to be seen in the context of a 170 percent rise in house prices over the past 10 years. Darling is to hold talks with mortgage lenders next week, according to a statement released after Brown held talks with bankers and financial experts on Tuesday. The talks will be part of the consultations on measures which may be needed to support money markets being battered by the global credit crun
