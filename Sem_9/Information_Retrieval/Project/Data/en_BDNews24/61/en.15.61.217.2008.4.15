<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 15 (bdnews24.com)  A scintillating century from opener Imrul Kayes Tuesday guided the GP-BCB Academy team to a convincing 75-run win over their African opponents in the Grameenphone Academy Cup opener in Chittagong. Hosts Bangladesh dispatched South Africa for 160, with 4.1 overs to spare, after making a modest 235 all out in 47.3 overs at the Bir Shrestha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium. The home side got off to a shaky start after losing opener Jahirul Islam for 9 after electing to bat first. However, Kayes repaired the damage with Nasiruddin Faruque (21) and Nasir Hossain (52), before becoming the fifth man to leave the field with the score at 182 for five in the 35th over. Kayes struck 113 off 104 balls, with 16 fours and two sixes adding to the total. Following Kayes' departure, Bangladesh slipped to 198 for seven, with Nasir and Dollar Mahmud (9) adding 23 runs for the eighth wicket. Bangladesh lost their last three wickets inside 14 runs, which brought an end to their innings at 235 all out. Nasir was the last batman out, at 52 off 63 balls with two fours and as many sixes in the total. Mthokozisi Shezi and Abdul Aziz Temoor grabbed three wickets apiece, while Neil Wagner chipped in with two for 41. In reply, South Africa lost two batsmen with the scoreboard reading six for two in 2 overs. The visiting side failed to recover their composure, finally posting 160 all out in 45.5 overs in face of superb bowling from spinners Suhrawardi Shuvo (3/31) and Nasir (3/24). Sammy Joe Avontoor achieved the top score with 39, although their 58 runs came in the last wicket partnership of Mondli (28 not out) and Abdul Aziz (30). bd
