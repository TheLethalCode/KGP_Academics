 MULTAN, Pakistan, April 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - About 2,000 Pakistani textile workers and labourers staged a violent protest on Monday against power cuts they said were hurting their livelihoods. Protesters in the eastern city of Multan manhandled government officials at an office of the state-owned power utility and torched several vehicles, a bank and a petrol pump, a Reuters witness said. Nearly two dozen people were hurt in the rioting as police fired shots in the air and used teargas to disperse the crowd. About 60 people have been detained, a senior police official said. Pakistan is suffering a power deficit of up to 3,000 MW mainly because of low water levels at major reservoirs, and is implementing load-shedding, or switching off power to areas for several hours a day, across the country. Protesters shouted slogans against the state-owned Pakistan Electric Power Company, blaming it for what they said were up to 18 hours of cuts a day, instead of about eight they said authorities had promised. "Our workers and labourers are forced to starve," said Abdul Khaliq Qandeel, a top official of the All Pakistan Power Looms Association that organised the protest.

Pakistan's installed capacity is about 19,845 MW, of which about one-third is produced by hydro-electric plants. Much of the rest is generated by thermal stations, fuelled primarily by gas and oil. In January, the government shut steel melting units across the country for two weeks and ordered hundreds of textile mills to reduce operations to cope with the power shortage. Gilani urged people to remain calm and be patient, saying his government was striving to deal with the problem it had inherited from the previous administration. Violence would serve no purpose, he said. "It would not help to overcome the electricity crisis," he said in a statement issued in the capital, Islamabad. Power cuts, as well as food shortages and inflation, fuelled anger against the previous government and contributed to a landslide opposition victory in a Feb. 18 general electi
