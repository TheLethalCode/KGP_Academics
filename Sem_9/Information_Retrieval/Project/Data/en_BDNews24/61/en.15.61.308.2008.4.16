<TITLE> Ukrainian president urged to back government </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Kiev, April 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko should sack the coalition government, which includes his own party, if he is not prepared to back it, a senior member of Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko's party said on Wednesday Mykola Tomenko accused Yushchenko of paying more heed to his own office and an executive security council than to the cabinet made up of elected lawmakers. "If today he thinks that his government is his own office, or the Council of National Security and Defence, to which every day members of (Viktor) Yanukovich's opposition cabinet come, he should courageously and openly say to the Ukrainian nation that he does not have faith in the government," Tomenko said. "Let him dismiss the government of Tymoshenko ... If he does not do this, then we would like for the president to say that he will work with the government." His comments follow weeks of verbal sniping between Tymoshenko -- in power since December when she replaced Yanukovich as premier after a snap election held in September -- and the president. The two were allies during the 2004 "Orange" popular revolution that swept Yushchenko to power in place of his arch rival Yanukovich. But relations between the pair are uneasy -- he sacked her as his first prime minister in 2005 after just seven months and is wary of her presidential ambitions. On Tuesday, Yushchenko's chief of staff said ministers responsible for the economy should resign for failing to get a grip on soaring inflation, the latest in a series of blows aimed at Tymoshenko's government.
