 Dhaka, April 14 (bdnews24.com)Millions celebrated Pahela Baishakh, the Bangla New Year, on Monday despite the continuing heatwave. Crowds streamed through the scorching city streets making for the leafy shade of Ramna Batamul amid heightened security. Cultural organisation Chhayanaut, which has been organising the day's centerpiece event since 1965, ushered in the first day of the Bangla year 1415 with songs and other performances in the cool early hours of the morning. The festive mood was not confined to the capital; people around the country welcomed the Bangla New Year amid merry making, fairs and festivities. Marchers in masks and traditional dress, mostly students of the Institute of Fine Arts, led a colourful parade of thousands through Dhaka University campus. But the crowds were soon awash in a sweltering sea, as there was no let up of the heatwave that had intensified in the days preceding Pahela Baishakh. A rickshawallah pulling New Year revellers under the scorching sun was seen passing out briefly in front of Jagganath Hall. As he cried out for water, the passengers handed him Tk 100 before walking away. Passengers on vehicles ranging from motorbikes to buses were not immune from the effects of the heat either, as they were stuck in tailbacks to allow the passage of pedestrians along the crowded streets. The Baishakhi celebration spread from Bangla Motor to the Institute of Fine Arts via Shahbag, Dhaka University's TSC to Kakrail and Topkhana Road. The Mongol Shobhajatra parade started from the institute of Fine Arts at 8am. Several thousand people participated in the parade, ushering in good spirits for the new year and vowing to defeat the any ill-will. Participants wore colourful masks or carried symbolic figures to protest fundamentalism, communalism and corruption. At the forefront of the parade were processionists carrying figures of the owl, tortoise, tiger and elephant as well as lakkhir sara (vessels of good fortune). The procession marched through Dhaka University campus and Ramna, with thousands of men, women and children of all ages and professions wearing colourful masks, carrying green banners and playing flutes and other instruments. Traditional baul or folk songs floated through the air at the Rabindra Sarobar area by Dhanmondi lake. Those who did not feel up to fighting through the crowds enjoyed the scenes of festivity from the roofs of their houses from Mirpur, Basabo and Old Dhaka to Uttara, Gulshan and Jatrabari. A US resident who participated in the festival told bdnews24.com: "We observe our New Year. But there is nowhere near such spirit in it. The participation of people of all ages on such a large scale is amazing." "It feels good to be here to welcome the Bangla New Year. Happy New Year!" Ahmed Sohel, a Dhaka University student of Islamic history, "Bangla New Year is rooted in the nationhood of Bangalees. So we came to the Ramna Batamul at dawn. There is huge emotion involved with this festival." A security blanket was thrown over the capital on the eve of the Bangla New Year, and strict safety measures taken across the rest of the country, to prevent any disturbance of the New Year festivities. Security forces swept Ramna Park, closing it to the public from 3 pm Sunday till 4 am Monday. A central control room, five observation towers, 22 closed circuit television cameras and 50 check posts were set up inside the park. Those who came to attend the Pahela Baishakh programme Monday morning were checked before entering the park. Bomb-disposal experts and dog squads patrolled the main festival premises and adjoining areas, with back-up forces on hand to face any situation round the clock. bdnews24.com/m
