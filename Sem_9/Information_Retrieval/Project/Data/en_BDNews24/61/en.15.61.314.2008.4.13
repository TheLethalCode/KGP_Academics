 MOSCOW, April 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The leaders of Georgia's breakaway regions have rejected a power-sharing deal offered by Tbilisi saying they will accept nothing less than full independence, Interfax news agency reported on Sunday. Last month Georgia's pro-Western President Mikhail Saakashvili offered Abkhazia broad autonomy, a strong role in the national government and economic perks. He has also offered educational and agricultural aid to South Ossetia, which like Abkhazia broke away from Georgia in the early 1990s, it if re-integrated.

Unresolved separatist conflicts were one of the reasons for NATO to reject Georgia's outright request. Abkhazia and South Ossetia, where most residents now hold Russian passports, have become a diplomatic tool for Moscow. Russia says it respects Georgia's territorial integrity. But it also says Abkhazia and South Ossetia have a legitimate right to seek independence after the West recognised Serbia's breakaway region of Kosovo over Belgrade's objections. President Vladimir Putin has not responded to pleas by the two regions to recognise their independence despite a resolution by the Russian parliament to do so. However, ahead of the NATO summit Russian officials hinted Moscow could do so if Georgia were admitted into the allian
