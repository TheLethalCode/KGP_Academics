 Gaza, April 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli troops killed four Hamas gunmen on Wednesday in clashes in the Gaza Strip near a terminal used to supply fuel to the coastal territory, Palestinian medical workers and Hamas said. Hamas said soldiers, backed by helicopters, killed four militants from the Islamist group during fighting east of Gaza city, a few hundred metres from the Nahal Oz border terminal. An Israeli army spokeswoman said soldiers clashed with Palestinian gunmen in the area and identified hitting them. Israel stopped fuel deliveries to the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip last week after an attack on the fuel terminal killed two Israeli civilians. Israel's defence ministry said it would renew fuel deliveries on Wednesday. Hamas Islamists seized control of the Gaza Strip after routing forces loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in June. Israel frequently carries out air strikes and raids against militants in Gaza in what it says is an effort to stop them from launching rockets into southern Israeli towns.
