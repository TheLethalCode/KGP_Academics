<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 17 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Bank is firm on its decision to appoint directors from among the depositors of the private commercial banks, the central bank chief said Thursday. A delegation of the Bangladesh Association of Banks (BAB), an organisation of private bank owners, held a meeting with BB governor Salehuddin Ahmed at his office Thursday morning. In the meeting the BAB delegation objected to the decision to appoint two directors from among depositors, but Salehuddin said the central bank is adamant in this regard. He told reporters after the meeting: "The banks have been doing good business recently. Bangladesh Bank has decided to appoint two directors from among the depositors to uphold the interest of the depositors." Bangladesh Bank has asked them to submit a final report in this regard within two weeks, Salehuddin said. The bank owners proposed appointing two independent directors instead of two depositor directors within the next two weeks. They also brought up the complexities involved in selection of two depositor directors. Nazrul Islam Majumder, chairman of Exim Bank and BAB, told reporters after the meeting: "It is very difficult to make a list of 25 persons from several thousand depositors." "That is why we proposed appointment of two independent directors from outside the depositors. Another meeting in this regard will be held with the central bank after two weeks." Bangladesh Bank in a recent circular asked private banks to appoint two directors from among the depositors, having prepared a draft policy on how the two directors should be selected. The draft policy states that to become a director of any bank a depositor would have to have made transactions with the bank for at least two years. To qualify the candidate must at minimum have an undergraduate degree from a recognised university. They will also need to have a proven track record in their respective professions. Persons having higher degrees in economics, commerce and business administration will be given priority. Each bank will be expected to prepare a list of 25 such depositors and submit the list to Bangladesh Bank. The central bank will make the final selection of two directors from among the 25. Bangladesh Bank is seeking further views from the chief executives of private banks. However, BAB has been opposing the central bank decision. bdnew24.
