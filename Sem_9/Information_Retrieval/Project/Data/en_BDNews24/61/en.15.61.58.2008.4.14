 MADRID, April 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid took a step closer towards retaining the Spanish title on Sunday after they recovered from a first-half sending off to clinch a 1-0 win over Real Murcia, while rivals Villarreal lost 1-0 at Almeria. With Barcelona drawing 2-2 at Recreativo Huelva on Saturday, the weekend's results left Real with an increased advantage of nine points at the top of the table. With six matches left to play, Real lead the standings on 69 points, Barca follow on 60 and Villarreal have 59. Real, who had won just one of their previous four matches, looked to be in trouble at the Bernabeu when fullback Miguel Torres was given a straight red for ploughing into Murcia midfielder Dani Aquino on 20 minutes. But despite a poor performance they managed to make off with the points thanks to a flash of brilliance from Dutch midfielder Wesley Sneijder who curled a shot into the corner on the hour after dispossessing a defender on the edge of the area. "We have to value this win although I would have liked to have seen a different sort of game," Real coach Bernd Schuster said. Like Real, Villarreal also found themselves a man down early in the game, keeper Diego Lopez receiving his marching orders when he lunged at Almeria striker Albert Crusat after miscontrolling a back pass from Javi Venta. Almeria striker Alvaro Negredo fired the resulting penalty over the bar and the game looked as though it would end up in a grim goalless draw until defender Santiago Acasiete poked home from close range in the dying minutes. CHAMPIONS LEAGUE RACE Behind the top three, the race for the remaining Champions League place hotted up after Atletico Madrid were held to a 1-1 draw at Valladolid while Sevilla clinched a 3-2 win away against Real Mallorca. Atletico looked to be on course for a narrow win after Argentine midfielder Maxi Rodriguez put the visitors in front with a spectacular half-volley midway through the second half. But Valladolid snatched a valuable point when Nigerian striker Bartholomew Ogbeche got in behind the Atletico defence to steer home at the near post. Atletico remain in fourth place on 54 points but are only one ahead of Racing Santander, who beat Valencia 2-1 on Saturday, and three clear of Sevilla. The Andalucians claimed an important away win over Mallorca thanks to goals from Renato, Frederic Kanoute and Daniel Alves. Basement side Levante claimed their first points in six games after a 1-0 win away to Real Betis but they remain seven points adrift of Murcia at the bottom. Real Zaragoza are also in serious trouble after being held to a 0-0 draw at Getafe. They have won just three of their last 22 games and remain in the relegation places, three points behind Recreativo Huelva
