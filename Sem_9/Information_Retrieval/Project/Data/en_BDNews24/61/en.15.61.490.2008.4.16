 Brusseles, April 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A debate on overhauling the farm-heavy European Union budget has been delayed, putting the politically charged issue on the backburner until after Britain and Ireland have ratified the bloc's reform treaty. The European Commission said on Wednesday it had extended by two months from mid-April the deadline for the 27 EU governments to send in proposals for reforming the community budget, worth 113 billion euros ($178.9 billion) last year. "The debate has triggered a lot of interest and we expect to receive many more contributions. The consultation period has been extended until June 15," said Commission spokeswoman Cristina Arigo. She said the extension was not politically motivated, but diplomats said it was meant to keep a major source of controversy off the agenda until the most sensitive countries, Britain and Ireland, had ratified the Lisbon treaty, which replaces the defunct EU constitution. The two countries are on opposite sides of the budget debate, with Dublin, a major beneficiary of farm subsidies, keen to preserve the Common Agricultural Policy, while London, a key net contributor to EU coffers, is eager to slash farm spending. "Some budgetary reforms may be difficult for some countries. Perhaps it is better not to debate them in the open before the treaty is ratified," one diplomat said, asking not to be named. Britain, where parliamentary ratification has stirred the biggest controversy, is expected to face demands that its cherished annual rebate from EU coffers be scrapped. Ireland is the only country holding a referendum, probably on June 12, on the treaty and a "Yes" is by no means assured, analysts say. A "No" could topple the project designed to end years of wrangling over reform of Europe's institutions. The treaty gives the European Union a long-term president, a stronger foreign policy chief, a streamlined decision-making system and more say for national and European parliaments. Delaying the deadline for input on budget reform means a major conference summing up the debate will be postponed from May to September or later, the spokeswoman said. The Commission still plans to publish its proposals in late 2008 or early 2009, she said. Changes are to take effect with the EU's next long-term budget for 2014-21. The reform is expected to curb farm funds, which eat up more than 40 percent of EU spending, and change the way revenue is collected so as to scrap Britain's rebate from EU coffers. Europe's biggest business lobby, BusinessEurope demanded this week that the bloc earmark more funds for research and innovation while keeping spending below the current ceiling of 1 percent of gross national income.
