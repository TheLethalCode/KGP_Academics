<TITLE> Maoists heading to victory in Nepal polls </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Kathmandu, April 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nepal's Maoists were marching to victory in the Himalayan nation's first election in nine years, surprising many who feared a poor show by the former rebels would have jeopardised a peace deal to end a civil war. The Maoists, who ended an insurgency two years ago and entered electoral politics, had won 42 of the 76 seats declared so far and were also leading by a similar proportion in other constituencies where counting was continuing, election officials said. Two other parties -- the Communist UML and the Nepali Congress -- earlier thought to be favourites have so far won only 13 and 11 seats respectively. The Maoists were also doing better than expected in the country's southern plains, home to nearly half of the population, an area where they were thought to be weak, latest tallies showed. The outcome of Thursday's election, the centrepiece of the peace deal, has surprised many analysts who had predicted the former rebels would emerge as the third largest party. "It has come as a bang," said Lok Raj Baral of Nepal Centre for Strategic Studies, a private think-tank. "Whether it ends up with a whimper remains to be seen," he said. "It is possible that they will win a majority." Baral said the results were a mandate for a change from the an ineffective old political order. The Maoists, on the other hand, had maintained their network at the grass-root level from their days as rebel fighters, he said. POISED FOR LANDSLIDE? "Maoists poised for landslide win," declared a headline in the Himalayan Times daily. Complete results are expected only next week as counting is slow and the election was a complex mixture of direct and proportional systems. Nepal voted for 601-member assembly, meant to write a new constitution for the impoverished Himalayan nation, formally end a 240-year-old monarchy, and make laws. While 240 seats will be filled on a first-past-the-post basis, another 335 will be decided by proportional representation and 26 nominated by the cabinet. The Maoists, once considered close to Peru's Shining Path guerrillas, now have abandoned the language of Marx and Mao, and promise to accept globalisation. "We urge every one not to doubt our commitment to multi-party competition," said Maoist chief Prachanda, after being declared a winner on Saturday. The United States still considers the Maoists as terrorists. The election, and the abolition of the monarchy, had been the main demands of the Maoists during their decade-long insurgency, in which more than 13,000 people died. Foreign observers said the polls were mostly smooth and asked political parties to respect the verdict. King Gyanendra, who stands to lose the most from the vote, also said he was satisfied with the "enthusiastic" participation of the voters.
