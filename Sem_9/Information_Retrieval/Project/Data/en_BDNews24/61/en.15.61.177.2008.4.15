 Gaza, April 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Israeli air strike killed a Palestinian militant in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip on Monday, Hamas and medical workers said. Witnesses said the missile strike killed Ibrahim Abu Elba, a local leader from the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, as he walked the streets of the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya. Medical workers said four bystanders were lightly wounded in the attack. An Israeli army spokeswoman said she was checking the report. Israel frequently carries out air strikes and raids against militants in the Gaza Strip in what it says is an effort to stop them from launching rockets into southern Israeli towns.
