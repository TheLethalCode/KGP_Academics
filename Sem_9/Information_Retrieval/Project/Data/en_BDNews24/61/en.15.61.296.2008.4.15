 GENEVA, April 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Muslim countries led by Iran and Pakistan called on the Netherlands on Tuesday to combat what they called rising Islamophobia and discrimination against immigrants in Dutch society. Condemning a film released by Dutch member of parliament Geert Wilders that accuses the Koran of condoning violence, they also urged Dutch authorities to prosecute its author for inciting hatred against Muslims. The video "Fitna", launched last month on the Internet, urges Muslims to tear out "hate-filled" verses from the Koran and starts and ends with a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammad with a bomb under his turban, accompanied by a ticking sound.

Nebahat Albayrak, Dutch state secretary for justice and one of two Muslims in the cabinet, told the Geneva forum her government had opposed the release of the film. Albayrak, who is Turkish-born, said her government was drawing up a plan to combat racial discrimination on the labour market, in law enforcement, criminal investigation and on the Internet. "Combating prejudice and respecting freedom of Muslims to practice their religion are key themes of our integration policies," she said. "The Dutch government strongly believes that fostering inter-action (between communities) will help us to combat discrimination and Islamophobia," she added. The Dutch public prosecutor was investigating a possible criminal offence in connection with the film, she added.
