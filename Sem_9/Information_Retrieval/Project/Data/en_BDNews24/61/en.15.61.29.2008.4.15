<TITLE> Decision on BNP invitation soon: CEC </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 15 (bdnew24.com)  The Election Commission will wait no longer to decide on an invitation to the BNP for pre-polls dialogue, the chief election commissioner said Tuesday. "We hope they (the two factions of BNP) will come to us together. If they don't we will have to take a decision. We will wait no more," CEC ATM Shamsul Huda told reporters in his office. "The verdict in the case has been delivered. After that, four to five days have gone by. We will not wait anymore." "Even then we will hope that the two secretaries general (of BNP) will reach an understanding and come to us in a body. That will be good for us, for them and for all." On April 10 after the delivery of the court verdict on the case regarding the EC's dialogue with BNP, the CEC told reporters that he would contact both factions of the BNP and ask them to sit in the dialogue together. Asked whether he had done so, Huda said, "I said I would contact them but from what I hear from the sides I don't feel interested. "Such statement has even been made that should we invite both factions it would mean that we would be doing so to split the party." "We have to get positive signal from their side. But we are not getting any positive signal," the CEC added. Asked if the two factions do not forge a common ground, then which faction would be invited to the dialogue, he said: "We have not yet got the copy of the (court) verdict in our hand. Once we get it we will make a decision." bdn
