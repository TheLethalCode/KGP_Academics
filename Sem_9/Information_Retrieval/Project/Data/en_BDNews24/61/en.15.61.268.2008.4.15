 London, April 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil advanced to a lifetime peak above $112 a barrel on Tuesday as investors sought to hedge against a battered dollar. US crude rose 39 cents to $112.15 a barrel at 1000 GMT, after touching a record high of $112.48 earlier in the session. Oil is up 17 percent from the start of the year and is averaging near $100. London Brent crude rose 49 cents to $110.33, after reaching a lifetime peak of $110.45 in Tuesday's trading. "One thing that is clearly driving the oil price is that the US dollar has gotten substantially weaker in the past several months and quarter," said Richard Batty of Standard Life. "The volatility in asset markets -- mainly equities -- has pushed investors towards commodities." The dollar held near record lows versus the euro on Tuesday ahead of U.S. economic data and first-quarter earnings results from corporate heavyweights this week. A weak dollar tends to raise prices for commodities denominated in that currency by boosting non-US spending power and by attracting investors seeking an inflation hedge. Dealers said oil's climb to fresh record highs has sparked a fresh wave of buying. Tetsu Emori, fund manager at Astmax Co Ltd said prices had risen due to automatically placed buying orders once the previous record had been breached. He sees the next resistance target at $115.

Those three ports ship about 80 percent of Mexico's crude exports. A smaller port in the Pacific was also shut, the Mexican government said. "The system is so tight that any supply problems cause real concern," said Robert Nunan of Mitsubishi Corp in Tokyo. "We just don't have the big cushion any more that we used to have, so it's much easier for money to come in and prop up prices now," he added. US gasoline futures hitting fresh highs on Monday also helped prices. They rose as the United States gears up for the summer driving season, when demand traditionally peaks. US crude oil inventories figures are due on Wednesday. They likely rebounded last week after a surprise drawdown the week before, with an increase in imports lifting supply, according to a preliminary Reuters poll of eight industry analys
