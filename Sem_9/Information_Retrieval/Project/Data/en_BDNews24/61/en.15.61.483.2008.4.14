 LONDON, April 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manager Alex Ferguson wants Manchester United to clinch the Premier League crown at title rivals Chelsea on April 26. United all but ended Arsenal's hopes by beating Arsene Wenger's men 2-1 at Old Trafford on Sunday, moving nine points clear of the Gunners with four matches left. Ferguson's team, looking for a second successive title, are six points clear of Chelsea who can close the gap to three points by defeating Wigan Athletic at Stamford Bridge later on Monday to extend their unbeaten home league run to 80 matches. "I said before the Arsenal match that if we win the next three games we've won the title," Ferguson told United's Web site (www.manutd.com). "I knew if we got over this one we would have a good chance. "If we win the next two (against Blackburn Rovers and Chelsea) with our great goal difference, we have won the league." Ferguson's men visit Blackburn on Saturday and also have to play West Ham United and Wigan. United have a goal difference of plus-54, compared to Chelsea's plus-35
