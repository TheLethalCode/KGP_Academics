 NEW DELHI, April 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thousands of members of the world's largest community of exiled Tibetans protested against the arrival of the Olympic torch in India on Thursday, holding rallies and staging alternative relays of Buddhist prayer lamps. Around 15,000 police will guard the torch later on Thursday as it takes a relay route, already shortened because of fears of demonstrations, through the city's former British colonial boulevards that have been lined with barriers and wire mesh. The torch, which is en route to China for the Summer Games in Beijing on a journey marked by demonstrations, arrived in a plane before dawn and was taken along a route lined with hundreds of police to spend the rest of the night in a luxury hotel. Police detained about two dozen Tibetan protesters along the route and in front of the hotel. Many were dragged into police vans as they shouted anti-China slogans. Later, thousands of Tibetans marched through the capital in a parallel relay to protest against Chinese policies, particular its crackdown last month on unrest in their homeland, and demand Tibet's independence. They carried golden prayer lamps. "China's torch is a flame of shame," read one of their banners. "There cannot be any Games without Tibet. Bring Tibet to the Games," said Tenzing Khentssin, dressed in a white "Torch Tibet" T-shirt as he marched amid chanting protesters, surrounded by hundreds of police. In the mainly Buddhist region of Ladakh in India's Himalayas, thousands of people, including monks clad in traditional red robes, marched to show solidarity with Tibetan protesters. In the IT hub of Bangalore, around 300 protesters shouting "Free Tibet" and "Save Tibet", carried an unlit torch through the city. In the financial hub of Mumbai, Tibetan protesters shouted slogans and waved Tibetan flags near Chinese consulate offices. Police had detained at least a dozen by Thursday morning. BESET BY PROTESTS The torch has been beset by protests through Europe and the Americas, over Chinese rule in Tibet. In some places, protesters tried to snuff out the flame and organisers extinguished or hid the torch to keep it safe. Fearing similar protests, India trimmed the route to a third of the original 9 km (5 mile) distance, restricting it to a high-security stretch used for the annual Republic Day parade in the Indian capital. "The security is very, very tight and we are not talking about the minute details at all to ensure there is no disruption during the rally," Rajan Bhagat, a police spokesman, said. India has been a centre of regular protests for weeks and exiles even scaled the walls of the Chinese embassy. Newspapers warned of traffic gridlock on Thursday. One large school near the Chinese embassy has warned parents of the dangers of tear gas from police wafting into classrooms if there are protests. Several metro stations in the capital were closed. The Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, has voiced his support for the Beijing Games. He has urged Tibetans to desist from disrupting the torch relay. But protests have continued unabated. India had to assure China of adequate security for the torch after the Chinese foreign minister called his Indian counterpart this month. The Indian government has been reluctant to criticise China over Tibet, despite some public support for the exiles as well as criticism in the media of New Delhi's soft line. The controversy reached parliament on Thursday. "The Olympic torch is a symbol of brotherhood and harmony but Delhi has been turned into a prison," said Mohan Singh, a member of India's parliament. Despite years of mistrust and a border war in 1962, a booming India is seeking closer relations with China, which is now one of its biggest trading partners. A total of 70 torch-bearers, including 45 current and former athletes, will carry the torch. But Indian football captain Bhaichung Bhutia has refused to carry the Olympic torch in protest against China's response to the unrest in Tibet. One of India's most famous cricketers, Sachin Tendulkar, has pulled out of the relay for personal reasons. The torch was in neighbouring Pakistan on Wednesda
