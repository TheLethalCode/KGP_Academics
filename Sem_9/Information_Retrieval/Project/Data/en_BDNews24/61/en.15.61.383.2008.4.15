 Dhaka, April 15 (bdnews24.com)BNP's Khaleda Zia-nominated secretary general, Khandaker Delwar Hossain, questioned why the government had gone ahead with pre-dialogue talks Tuesday with a rival party faction, calling the move "unfortunate". "We did not say that we would not go to the dialogue. We just said we needed to talk to our leader before sitting in such talks. It was part of the process of going to the talks," he said in a press briefing after a meeting with senior BNP leaders at his residence near Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban. Delwar alleged the government had not given them a chance to participate in the upcoming dialogue. "The government and the Election Commission were playing a drama over the dialogue. The countrymen know who the legal secretary general of the BNP is. They invited their own 'manufactured' secretary general to the talks." he said. Delwar termed the faction led by M Saifur Rahman and Hafizuddin Ahmed 'the government's BNP', and questioned the administration's motives over wanting to hold talks with BNP. Replying to a question, Delwar said: "We are united under the leadership of Khaleda Zia. There is no scope for misunderstanding over that." BNP leader ASM Hannan Shah told reporters they were prepared to wage a movement to free Khaleda Zia. "We are fighting a legal battle to free our leader. Dialogue was our next target. If it does not work, we will declare programmes soon," Hannan Shah said. Goyeshwar Chandra Roy said the government had to confirm the participation of Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia for a successful dialogue. bdnew
