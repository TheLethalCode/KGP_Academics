 Shanghai, April 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese Web users, stung by international criticism of China ahead of the Beijing Olympics, have splashed red across the Internet by adding hearts and "CHINA" to their names when chatting online in a show of support. Several Reuters reporters' contact lists for online chat programmes, such as Microsoft Corp's MSN, steadily filled up with red hearts during the day, though opinions differed as to what, exactly, the symbol signified. "This is aimed at all those forces which want to bring chaos to China," said one user who had posted a photo of herself dressed in People's Liberation Army fatigues. "That of course includes those pro-Tibet activists," she said, adding that she was boycotting French supermarket chain Carrefour "since France supports Tibet independence". Others said the heart was simply a symbol of pride and affection for their country. "Heart + CHINA only means 'I love China', no other meaning to me. If I wanted to express 'I am against Tibet independence', I would say I am against Tibet independence," said another user. Only a few contacts did not follow the trend, but were reluctant to elaborate on their reasons. "I don't really have mainland contacts," said a Hong Kong Chinese contact working in mainland China, by way of explanation.
