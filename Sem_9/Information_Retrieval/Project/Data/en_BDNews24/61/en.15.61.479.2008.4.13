 Dhaka, April 13 (bdnews24.com) - Retired Major-General Amin Ahmed Chowdhury Sunday declared his intention to run for president in the upcoming Bangladesh Football Federation election. Chowdhury officially announced his intentions at a press conference at the National Sports Council's conference room. In a show of solidarity with the retired army officer, former BFF general secretary Harun-or-Rashid and joint secretary Badal Roy attended the press briefing. Chowdhury described himself as an old-hand in the sports world, saying: "I have been considering contesting the BFF poll since October or November, no sudden decision was taken." He went on to say his involvement in the opening and concluding ceremonies of the SAFF Games in 1985 and 1993 gave him invaluable experience in the field, while he remained a lifelong football fan. "I have come with the intention of resurrecting football's pride," said the former army officer. Meanwhile, legendary footballer Kazi Salahuddin has also declared his intention to contest for the BFF's top post, in an election scheduled for April 28. Salahuddin is a pride of Bangladesh, said Chowdhury, adding that he had suggested working together when he recently visited his opponent, although a pact failed to emerge due to the lengthy preparations on Salahuddin's behalf. Chowdhury bid has sparked a tough contest for the top post at the BFF. The former army officer also suggested that all organisers come under a single umbrella to form an active BFF committee that would ensure the smooth running of leagues and tournaments every year. Also present at the briefing were former star footballers Jakaria Pintu, Salam Murshedi, Sheikh Mohammad Aslam, Rummon Bin Wali Sabbir and renowned organisers Kazi Nabil Ahmed, Lokman Hossain Bhuiya, Nurul Islam Chowdhury and Shawkat Ali Khan Jahangir. bdnew
