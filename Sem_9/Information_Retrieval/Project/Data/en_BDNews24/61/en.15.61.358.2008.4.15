 Brahmanbaria, April 15 (bdnews24.com)Joint forces recovered nine grenades, three foreign-made pistols and 15 bullets from a paddy field behind the Bhadughar Bhuiyan Steel Co in Bhadughar area of Brahmanbaria Tuesday. Brahmanbaria Sadar police chief Kamal Uddin said an unidentified man had phoned the police at about 11am and said that a bag containing a bomb-like substance was lying in the paddy field. The joint forces went to the scene at 1.45pm and recovered the bag stuffed with the ammunition and weapons. The grenades are believed to be handmade, RAB-9 Bhairab camp commander Mazhar said. The RAB official said a team led by RAB-9 explosives expert Captain Monzur Elahi was deactivating the grenades. He said that RAB and police conducted a massive raid after bombs exploded while being manufactured in a shop in Bhadughar municipal bus-stand area Sunday. It is believed that some persons frightened by the drive might have left the grenades and other arms in the paddy field. bdnews24.c
