 Dhaka, April 13 (bdnews24.com)Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said Sunday hurdles on the path to regional trade between Bangladesh and India started melting. "We are trying to remove the last remaining obstacles we have. If we all work together we will be able to reach our goal," the adviser told reporters in his office after a meeting with trade delegates of Bangladesh and India. Visiting Confederation of Indian Chambers leader Alok Mukherjee and Bangladesh Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI) Latifur Rahman led the delegations. Hossain Zillur said Bangladesh was on its way to an economic takeoff. "In such a situation the government has taken steps to control the prices of a number of essential commodities including rice," he said. "At the same time, the government is also looking into the issue of regional trade." A high-powered Indian trade delegation is now in Dhaka, seeking to buy eight lakh pieces of readymade garment from Bangladesh. "When the rail services between Bangladesh and India start on Pahela Baishakh the situation will improve. It will add more impetus to regional trade," he said. bdnew
