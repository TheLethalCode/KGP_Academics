<TEXT>
 CARSON, Calif., April 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - David Beckham could not hide his disappointment after the Los Angeles Galaxy slipped to a 3-2 home defeat against Toronto FC on Sunday. The England midfielder played all 90 minutes but could not prevent his team from dropping their first home points of the campaign against the previously winless Canadian side. "We are disappointed," he said. "Three games into the season we can't panic too much but it is obviously not the result we wanted." Danny Dichio put Toronto ahead on 42 minutes, with Landon Donovan equalising for the Galaxy a minute later. Jarrod Smith got Toronto back into the lead after 53 minutes before Beckham helped to win a penalty for his team when Carl Robinson handled his attempted cross inside the area. Donovan converted the spot-kick but Galaxy's hopes were dashed when Jeff Cunningham scored a breakaway goal with three minutes to go, leaving the hosts to rue a series of missed chances. "As long as I can create chances at some point we are going to score," he said. "Hopefully that will start soon." The Galaxy play defending MLS Cup champions Houston Dynamo at the Home Depot Center on April 19
