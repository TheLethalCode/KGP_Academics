 KANPUR, India, April 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India defeated South Africa by eight wickets with two days to spare in the third and final test on Sunday to square the series 1-1 after routing the tourists for 121 in their second innings. Indian spinners Harbhajan Singh and Virender Sehwag shared seven wickets to rip through the South African batting on a crumbling pitch before coasting to their 62-run victory target. The home team reached 64 for two wickets to level the series and bounce back from their innings defeat in the second test. South Africa conceded a 60-run first innings lead in the morning after the Indian last wicket pair of Shanthakumaran Sreesanth (29) and Ishant Sharma (14 not out) added 46 runs to take the total to 325. Their batting then collapsed on a dusty pitch after Sehwag claimed key batsman Jacques Kallis (15) and skipper Graeme Smith (35) in succession to end their dogged 38-run third wicket stand. Harbhajan struck straightaway after tea, taken on 88 for four, before teenaged paceman Ishant Sharma struck twice in one over as South Africa tumbled to their third lowest total against India. Harbhajan returned 4-44 and Sehwag 3-12, the last eight wickets tumbling for 56 runs. Opener Sehwag struck a 12-ball 22 with two successive sixes against left-arm spinner Paul Harris before India sealed victory, dashing South African hopes for an Asian treble after series wins in Pakistan and Bangladesh. India lost the second test by an innings and 90 runs after the first test in Chennai ended in a high-scoring draw
