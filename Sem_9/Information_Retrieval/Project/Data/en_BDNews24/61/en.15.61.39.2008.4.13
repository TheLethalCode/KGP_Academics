 Dhaka, April 13 (bdnews24.com)  BNP joint secretary general Goyeshwar Chandra Roy Sunday asked the Chief Election Commissioner to reverse a previous decision and invite the party's "lawful" secretary general, Khandaker Delwar Hossain, to reforms dialogue. "Khandaker Delwar Hossain is the lawful secretary general of the party," Goyeshwar told reporters at former BNP lawmaker Md Shahjahan's NAM flat. "If the Election Commission does not invite him to dialogue we will assume the government and the EC want to split the BNP. People will not accept that," he said. The acting secretary general of the reformist faction, Hafizuddin Ahmed, had earlier said they wished to enter into dialogue with representatives of the opposing faction of the divided party. However, ruling out Hafiz's remarks in a fiery response, Goyeshwar said: "Who is Major Hafiz? He is known as a vice-president of the party to the leaders and activists of the party." "Nobody requires him beyond that position," he said. Goyeshwar warned the caretaker administration and the EC that any move to hold talks with both factions would be a "wrong decision". "If they want to hold dialogue with the BNP they will have to send an invitation to Delwar Hossain, otherwise the party will not attend the talks," the BNP leader said. Goyeshwar reiterated the party's demand to have their chairperson Khaleda Zia and political rival Sheikh Hasina, the Awami League president, released from detention as soon as possible. "The government must ensure the presence of the two leaders in the dialogue process if they want to make it a success," said the joint secretary general. The BNP leader added that their release would create a positive environment for the reforms dialogue. bdnew
