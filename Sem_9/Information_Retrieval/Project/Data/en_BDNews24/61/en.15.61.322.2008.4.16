 Multan, April 16 (bdnews24.com)  Fifties from Salman Butt and Bazid Khan powered Pakistan to a convincing seven-wicket win over Bangladesh in the fourth one-day international at Multan Cricket Stadium Wednesday. Hosts Pakistan raced to 212 for three in 44.3 overs after bowling Bangladesh out for 210 with five balls to spare. Butt played a stroke-filled 74 off 84 balls with the help of eight fours while Bazid played a patient 51 off 90 balls featuring two fours and one six. Openers Butt and Kamran Akmal (36) laid a solid foundation putting on 97 runs for the stand before Shakib Al Hasan broke the stand having the latter caught by Mashrafee Bin Mortaza. Butt was run out by a direct throw from Abdur Razzak, who also removed Bazid, but by then Pakistan almost went to the target with scoreboard reading 199 for three in 42.3 overs. Mohammad Yousuf (37) and Fawad Khan (5) remained unbeaten to steer Pakistan to a straight fourth win. Earlier, Shakib struck his second ODI century as Bangladesh recovered their shaky start to end up at a respectable 210 with five balls to go. Shakib slammed a timely century to save Bangladesh from the blues before he was the last batsman out for 108. The left-handed batsman clubbed eight fours facing 120 balls. The 21-year old cricketer along with Mashrafee put on 97 for the ninth wicket to set a new record for the Tigers, eclipsing the previous best of unbeaten 62 against West Indies laid by Khaled Mashud and Mohammad Rafique at Kingston in 2004. Shakib and Mashrafee showed others how to bat on a flat wicket after the top order, comprising Tamim Iqbal, Junaed Siddique, Aftab Ahmed and Mohammad Ashraful, threw their wickets away to leave their side at 16 for four inside six overs. Pacer Mohammad Asif broke the ninth wicket stand having Mashrafee (39) caught by Fawad Alam, who easily caught Shakib off Sohail Khan in the final over. Umar Gul, who replaced Iftikhar Anjum, rattled the top order sending back Junaed (three-ball duck), Aftab Ahmed (two-ball duck) and Ashraful (4 off 11 balls) while Asif dismissed in-form opener Tamim Iqbal (10 off 12 balls). Shakib pairing with Mahmudullah (9) and Farhad Reza (14) produced two brief resistances to add 29 for the fifth wicket and 39 for the sixth wicket before Mashrafee joined Shakib. Gul (3/48) and Mohammad Asif (2/35), who returned to international cricket following his six-month break, rattled the visitors' top-order while Sohail (3/30) along with Shahid Afridi (1/34) and Shoaib Malik (1/32) wiped the visitors' innings. bdn
