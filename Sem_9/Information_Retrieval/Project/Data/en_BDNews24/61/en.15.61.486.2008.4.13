 Dhaka, Apr 13 (bdnews24.com)  Five advisers met with chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Sunday to brief him on preparations for the dialogue between the government and political parties, an adviser said. "The chief adviser has given us necessary guidelines that will help make the dialogue successful," communications adviser Ghulam Quader told reporters in his office after returning from the CA's office. On whether any condition will be attached by the government or the political parties, Quader said: "Neither the government nor political parties have any strings to it." "Talks are going unconditional and the final dialogue will also be held the same way," he added. On whether the representatives of civil society or donor agencies will join the dialogue, the adviser said: "The dialogue will be held between the government and the political parties and nobody else." Four other advisers who went to the CA's office are law adviser AF Hassan Ariff, LGRD adviser Anwarul Iqbal, foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury and commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman. bdnews24
