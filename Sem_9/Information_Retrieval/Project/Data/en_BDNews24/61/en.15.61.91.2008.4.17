 Dhaka, Apr 17, (bdnews24.com)A group of BNP leaders led by Hafizuddin Ahmed called on the EC Thursday to announce the election schedule as early as possible to implement the election roadmap, a party leader said. The BNP leaders made the request during an hour-long talk, billed as a 'courtesy call', with the Election Commission. BNP acting secretary general Hafizuddin Ahmed, standing committee member Mahbubur Rahman, Khaleda Zia's adviser Mofazul Karim and former MP Fazlul Azim met with chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda and election commissioners Muhammed Sohul Hussain and M Sakhawat Hussain at the EC Secretariat from 10.30am. Mahbubur Rahman told reporters after the talks: "The discussion was fruitful, even though it was seen as a 'courtesy call'." There had been no specific agenda at the meeting, he said. "But we urged the EC to announce the election schedule as soon as possible." The BNP leader said his group had confidence in the EC. "The role of the Election Commission is important in development of democracy. It is working for a free and fair election." On unity within the troubled party, he said: "There is no division in BNP. We will pursue politics jointly, participating in the election and going for dialogue with the Election Commission and the government." When asked who had raised the question of party unity in Thursday's talks, Mahbubur said that both the EC and his group had addressed it. He added: "The Election Commission told us to sit for dialogue together." The other three leaders attending the talks left the secretariat building as soon as the meeting was over, as some agitation broke out between the supporters of the two BNP factions. EC deputy secretary (law) AKM Salimullah told reporters prior to the talks: "This is a good sign that these talks are taking place." "How fruitful they will be, however, cannot be said until the talks are over," he added. The BNP group representing the Khandaker Delwar Hossain-led faction also met with the EC representatives Thursday from midday. The Election Commission invited the BNP two factions to separate meetings, though Khaleda Zia-appointed secretary general Delwar said he would personally not attend the talks. In its letter, the EC described Delwar and Hafizuddin only as a 'BNP leaders', but did not address them as secretary generals, acting or otherwise, BNP spokespersons said. The talks are meant to find ways to ease the political deadlock over the EC's planned dialogue with the BNP factions, which has so far stalled the process of finalising electoral reform laws. In recent months, the commission has wrapped up two rounds of talks with all major political parties excluding BNP. bdnews24.c
