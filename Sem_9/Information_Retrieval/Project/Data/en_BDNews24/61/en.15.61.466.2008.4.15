 TEHRAN, April 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The number of executions in Iran is "not high", the judiciary said on Tuesday, responding to an Amnesty International report that listed the Islamic Republic as the world's second most prolific executioner in 2007. European governments and Western rights groups have criticised Iran for an increasing number of hangings since authorities launched a clampdown on "immoral behaviour" in July.

At least 1,252 people were executed in 24 countries last year and 3,347 sentenced to death in 51 countries, Amnesty said. China and Iran were followed by Saudi Arabia, with 143 executions, Pakistan with 135, and the United States, which executed 42 people. Between them, these five countries accounted for 88 percent of all known executions. Amnesty said the number of executions had risen from 2006 in Iran, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.
