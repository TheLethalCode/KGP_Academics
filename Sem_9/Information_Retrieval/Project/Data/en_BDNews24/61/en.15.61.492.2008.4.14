 KABUL, April 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The International Committee of the Red Cross has urged the Afghan military, foreign troops and Taliban insurgents to spare civilians during combat, the organisation's global chief said on Monday. Jakob Kellenberger also said suspected Taliban prisoners held by the US military at Bagram were concerned about their fate and pressed the Afghan government for judicial guarantees and better treatment for the inmates it holds at Pul-i-Charkhi jail. Former detainees have complained of being ill-treated and tortured and many are kept without trial at the Afghan jail on the eastern outskirts of Kabul. Kellenberger said the ICRC wanted to have access to more prisons and spoke about the concerns of inmates held by the US military at Bagram air base north of Kabul, the main US military base in Afghanistan.

"I was very much insisting ... on the protection of civilians and said 'there must be ... a distinction between civilians and those who are participating directly in combat'," he told a news conference at ICRC's headquarters in Kabul. More than 20,000 people, thousands of them civilians, have been killed in Afghanistan since US-led troops invaded the country in 2001 and toppled the Taliban government, according to estimates compiled by various foreign and Afghan sources. Kellenberger said ICRC was documenting possible violations of humanitarian laws by all sides involved in the Afghan conflict, had made certain recommendations, but refused to make them public because of the organisation's mandate. He said he had urged the Taliban to guarantee the security of aid workers in areas where the militants were active and that the Taliban's reply had been positiv
