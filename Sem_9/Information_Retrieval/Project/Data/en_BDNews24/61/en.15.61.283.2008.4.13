 Dhaka, April 13 (bdnews24.com) -- Editors from a number of news outlets Sunday claimed that many people in the country remained reluctant to pay their taxes out of fear of harassment. The comments came at a pre-budget exchange of views meeting between the editors and the finance adviser organised by the National Board of Revenue. The NBR's annual report for 2006-07 was also formally released at the meeting, which was held at the NBR's conference room in the city. Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam conceded that certain forms of harassment remained endemic within the taxation system, although he said the power of tax officials would be curtailed in the future to mitigate the problem. "To decrease tax payers harassment the discretionary powers of tax officials were reduced to some extent in the last budget. In the next budget they will be further reduced," said Mirza Aziz. The adviser said there was now no further scope to allow black money to be whitened, he added, however, that it was possible that the tenure of the tax holiday would be increased. "The accumulated problems of the past can not be solved overnight. Change will require time. So far people have not wanted to pay their taxes," the adviser said. "But now the common people at the district and upazila levels are spontaneously coming forward to pay their taxes," he said. The adviser said following research into the tax regimes of a number of other countries he was considering increasing the tax holiday for "one or two more years". "We have found that various countries provide limited tax holidays. We are actively considering this option." "The current tax holiday terminates at the end of this year. We are thinking of increasing the opportunity for one or two more years in the next budget." The adviser reminded the editors that it was the task of the next elected government to make a full decision regarding the move after comprehensive deliberations. Regarding the whitening of black money, for which the caretaker administration has made provisions in the past, the adviser said: "It is unethical." "However, the illegally earned wealth which remained undeclared can be made legal in line with the existing law," he said. Azizul said anyone wishing to legitimise their undeclared income must consult with the NBR, and an understanding would be arrived at through a kind of negotiation. Matiur Rahman Chowdhury, the editor of Manavjamin, suggested a tax friendly environment would increase the government's revenue earning. Deputy editor of The Financial Express Shamsul Huq Zahid advised the caretaker government to expand the tax net rather than increasing the rate of taxation. NBR chairman Abdul Mazid added that the NBR's annual report is to be published in September from now on. bdnews
