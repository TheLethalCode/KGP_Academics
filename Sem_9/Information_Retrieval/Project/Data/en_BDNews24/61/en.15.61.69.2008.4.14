 ROME, April 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Following are comments from political scientists and economists on the exit poll results from the Italian election which suggests Silvio Berlusconi has a small majority of votes in both houses of parliament. VALENTINA FERRARIS, ECONOMIST, REF THINK-TANK "The result looks very close and considering the exit polls got it wrong last time I would be very cautious about drawing conclusions. "What we can say is that if the exit polls are accurate there is a risk of finding ourselves in a similar situation to what happened with the Prodi government, with no-one having a clear majority in the senate or the senate result being different to the one in the lower house. "That would be the worst result for the economy. It would confirm the need to change the electoral law but in the meantime we would have more instability and more ungovernability." GILLES MOEC, ECONOMIST, BANK OF AMERICA "It looks like it's going to be a very close call. Italy's main problem is that it needs bold reforms, for example on pensions and public spending. "To get these reforms through you need a strong majority in parliament. Given these early polls, it's very unlikely that the next government will have any real possibility of changing things thoroughly." LUIGI SPERANZA, ECONOMIST, BNP PARIBAS "These exit poll results are so close that they don't eliminate the spectre of one chamber going to one side and the other chamber going to the other. "That would mean more uncertainty which in the short term is the worst possible scenario for Italy's economy at a very difficult time. "But the situation is very unclear and we need to wait longer to have a better picture." FRANCO PAVONCELLO, POLITICS PROFESSOR AT JOHN CABOT UNIVERSITY IN ROME "Let's see what happens in the Senate. If those are the numbers, I don't think we have a victor. "Berlusconi may carry the lower house, but with the way things are structured in the upper house, Veltroni could have an alliance and control the senate. So we're stuck." SUSANA GARCIA, ECONOMIST, DEUTSCHE BANK "We can't trust the exit polls as we saw last time, but if these numbers are confirmed it would point to a very weak government. "Whoever wins will probably have to govern with small parties and we may be looking at another short-lived government. "That kind of government will find it almost impossible to pass the structural reforms Italy needs, especially in such a difficult international economic environment." JAMES WALSTON, POLITCS PROFESSOR AT AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF ROME: "The margin of error is too close to call. If that's confirmed, it's anybody's race. What is even more likely now is that there is a fair chance that Berlusconi is going to win the chamber as predicted, but the senate is going to be very uncertain. At the moment we're looking at a hung parliament, or a non-working majority
