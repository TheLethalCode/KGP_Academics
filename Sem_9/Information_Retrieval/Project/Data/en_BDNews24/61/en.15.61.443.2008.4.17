 ABUJA, April 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nigerian authorities have freed four U.S. documentary film-makers and their Nigerian colleague who were detained last week in the violence-prone Niger Delta, a spokeswoman for the film group said. "The four Americans and one Nigerian citizen who have been held in custody since Saturday by Nigerian authorities have been released to American Embassy personnel in Abuja," Sweet Crude Movie spokeswoman Leslye Wood said late on Wednesday. In a statement sent to Reuters, she said the four Americans -- Sandy Cioffi, Tammi Sims, Cliff Worsham and Sean Porter -- had been taken from a detention centre to an Abuja hotel. The Seattle-based film crew, along with the Nigerian head of a local non-government organisation in the Delta, had been working on a documentary about oil production in the region, where militants frequently attack oil installations. The group were stopped and detained by the Nigerian military in the Sapele district of the western Delta on Saturday, and then taken to the Nigerian capital Abuja for questioning. Authorities said they were travelling without a military escort. Their lawyers said they had broken no laws. The Niger Delta is where the bulk of Nigeria's oil is produced. Militants frequently kidnap foreign nationals there as part of a campaign to seek greater autonomy and a bigger share in the wealth of the world's eighth largest oil exporter. The commander of the military task force responsible for policing the western Delta, where the Americans were detained, said his forces had information that more kidnappings were planned and had been concerned for their safety. Nigerian authorities have detained a number of foreigners in the Niger Delta recently, including an American expert on the region, Judy Asuni, who was later released.
