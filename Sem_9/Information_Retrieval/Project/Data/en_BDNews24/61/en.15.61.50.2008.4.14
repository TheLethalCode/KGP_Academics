 BERLIN, April 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Luca Toni, who scored two late extra-time goals to save Bayern Munich in the UEFA Cup on Thursday, blasted two more in the Bundesliga on Sunday to take his season's tally to 31 in all competitions. The Italian striker was still so hungry for goals on Sunday after helping Bayern to a 4-0 lead over Borussia Dortmund after just 22 minutes that he refused coach Ottmar Hitzfeld's offer to take the second half off. "Luca wants to play every minute," Hitzfeld told Premiere Television after Bayern beat Dortmund 5-0. "I asked him at half-time if he wanted to play the whole match or come off and he said 'Tor, Tor, Tor'," Hitzfeld said, referring to the German word for "goal" that Toni has learned so well since moving from Fiorentina in the off season. "He didn't want to come off. He's got this incredible winning mentality," Hitzfeld said. Toni's two late goals against Getafe on Thursdayin the 115th and 120th minutegave Bayern a 3-3 draw in the UEFA Cup, enough to advance to the semi-finals on the away-goals rule. Toni's two goals on Sundayin the 18th and 22nd minute during a ferocious first half hour for Bayernmeant that he scored four goals within a span of 27 minutes of play in the two competitions, three days apart. Toni, 30, leads the Bundesliga scoring table with 18 goals in 26 matches, three ahead of Mario Gomez of VfB Stuttgart. He also has 10 goals in 10 UEFA Cup matches and three goals in three German Cup matches. Bayern, 10 points clear at the top of the Bundesliga table, are chasing three titles this season and can collect the first on Saturday in the German Cup final
