 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Kolkata, April 15 (bdnews24.com)It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience for the passengers on Monday's inaugural journey of the Maitree (Friendship) Express from Dhaka to Kolkata, restoring the direct passenger train service between India and Bangladesh that last ran in 1965. As the express sped along the 500 kilometres (310 miles) from Dhaka to Kolkata on Bangla New Year's Day, men, women and children lined the tracks on both sides of the bordercheering, waving and taking snaps of the 'friendship train' with their mobile phones. Wherever the train halted, even for minutes, crowds poured into the stations to glimpse the train that was connecting the Bangla people of the two neighbouring countries after 43 long years. The passengers were moved and overwhelmed by the public's response. "It is really a touching experience. I feel proud to be a passenger on this first historic journey," former vice chancellor of Dhaka University AK Azad Chowdhury told bdnews24.com. As the train stopped for water in Ishwardi around noon, for just ten minutes, the local people surrounded the train. "The people took such an interest as if we were VIPs," passenger Zobaidur Rahman told bdnews24.com. "How lucky you are to be passengers of the first train!" a young schoolgirl told the passengers of the AC carriage as the train waited. Teenaged girls, clad in festive New Year sarees, welcomed the Maitree Express showers of flower petals at the platform of Darasan Station, the last stop before India. The locals flocked around the security cordon for the three hours of customs and immigration checks until the train was on its way again at around 5pm, leaving the Bangladesh border behind. People who gathered at the zero line village of Joynagar cheered and clapped as the train slowly rolled into Indian territory. In Gede, the Indian border station, locals again thronged the place to have a glimpse of the Maitree Express and its passengerswhile the station itself welcomed the passengers with Bangla songs playing through the loud speakers. From the border to Kolkata, though it grew darker as night fell, the passengers could make out through the windows that the people of India were no less welcoming or enthusiastic about the Bangladeshi express. People who had stood for hours along the tracks and at every station, awaiting the famous first Friendship Express, continued to wave and cheer even in the dark of night. It was almost an anticlimax to finally reach Chitpur station in Kolkata at 9.00 pm, where hundreds had gathered to welcome the arrival of the long-awaited train that restored the historic rail link. "I am so happy to be a part of the history of this train," 72 year-old Raisul Haq from Dhaka told waiting reporters. "I travelled from Dhaka to Kolkata by train in 1962 with my father. I was just a 7 year-old boy." "The emotional response of people of both countries proves that they want to meet each other. They have been given the chance now," he said. Seventy five year-old Momena Begum said: "I travelled here once by train in 1965. Now I am returning to Kolkata by train again. This is a great moment of my life." bdn
