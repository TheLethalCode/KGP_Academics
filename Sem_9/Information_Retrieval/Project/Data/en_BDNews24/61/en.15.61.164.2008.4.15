 MOSCOW, April 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Storchak, charged with embezzling $43 million, has complained that he has not once been questioned despite being held for five months, his lawyer said on Tuesday. Marina Nikolskaya said Storchak, who denies the charges, had sent a letter to the investigative committee of the prosecutor-general to complain. "They have told him that there will be an interrogation. They haven't yet interrogated him," Nikolskaya told Reuters by telephone. "He is waiting for an answer." A spokeswoman for the investigative committee declined to comment. Police detained Storchak in November in a case analysts say could be part of a turf war between rival Kremlin factions for control of the state's vast hoard of cash as Vladimir Putin prepares to transfer the presidency to Dmitry Medvedev on May 7. A Russian court last week extended his pre-trial detention period to July 9. Storchak was Russia's chief foreign debt negotiator and oversaw the country's stabilisation fund, which held $157 billion before being split this year into a growth-oriented National Wealth Fund and a Reserve Fund to cushion the budget from any fall in international oil prices. Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin has appealed for his deputy's release and offered personally to vouch for Storchak if he is allowed out. Among the charges faced by Storchak is a failed attempt to recover a debt owed by Algeria. Kommersant business daily reported on its front page that Storchak's letter was handwritten and 30 pages in length. These details were not confirmed by Nikolska
