 Washington, April 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States expressed concern on Monday about the welfare of one of its citizens who was imprisoned in Belarus and transferred to a state psychiatric hospital there. Emanuel Zeltser, a New York-based lawyer, has only been seen by U.S. officials once -- on March 27 -- since his arrest at the Minsk airport on March 12, State Department officials said. Zeltser has been charged with conspiracy to commit fraud and given a state-appointed lawyer, U.S. officials said. They said he had arthritis and diabetes and he requested medicine for back pain when he was seen on March 27. "The government of Belarus failed to provide timely notification of his arrest, information about his medical condition, and did not inform the U.S. Embassy of his recent transfer to a state psychiatric hospital," a statement by State Department spokesman Tom Casey said. "We urge the government of Belarus to comply with their international legal obligations and provide immediate and regular consular access to Emanuel Zeltser," Casey said. Zeltser, 54, who was born in Russia but emigrated to the United States, is an expert on Russian organized crime and money laundering who has testified before Congress and appeared as a legal analyst on television and radio. His legal clients included the late Georgian opposition politician Badri Patarkatsishvili, Zeltser's brother Mark said in a telephone interview. Patarkatsishvili died in February at his mansion near London. Police there have found no evidence of foul play. Tensions between the United States and Belarus have grown recently after the United States imposed sanctions on Minsk in connection with human rights violations in the former Soviet republic. But State Department officials declined to speculate about whether there might be any connection between the soured diplomatic relations and Zeltser's case. Zeltser is director of the American Russian Law Institute, which promotes legal reform in Russia. The institute says Zeltser and his assistant Vladlena Funk were arrested at the airport in Minsk immediately upon arrival on a flight from London on March 12. Funk, a Russian citizen, also is still being held, Mark Zeltser said. The size of the U.S. Embassy in Minsk was cut in March at the request of Belarus' government, and the U.S. ambassador, Karen Stewart, left Minsk in March after she was urged to do so by the Belarussian government.
