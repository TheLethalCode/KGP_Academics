<TITLE> M Tamim warns of energy crisis </TITLE>

 Dhaka, April 15 (bdnews24.com)Prof M Tamim, a special assistant to the chief adviser, Tuesday underscored quick steps to help the country avoid a severe energy crisis that may strike in five years from now. "A decision on exploration and production of energy from coal and its conservation has to be made as soon as possible," Tamim, in charge of the power, energy and mineral resources ministry, said in his speech to a seminar "Action Planning Exercise to Address Energy and Power Crisis in Bangladesh" at The Westin Dhaka. Prof Tamim said the coal policy would be implemented soon and energy prices would have to be reset. UNDP and German firm GTZ organised the seminar in cooperation with the Power Division. The 1996 energy policy speaks of bringing energy prices within "economic costs" in five years, but it was never implemented. Energy prices increased only 5 percent until 2001. "Our political leadership will have to take a specific stand on energy. If prices are not re-fixed at some point in time, it will not be possible to supply energy," he said. "Policy is a fundamental issue. Laws and ordinances in this regard must be updated," he added. Prof Tamim said subsidy in energy must be reconsidered. "For Tk 40 worth of diesel, Tk 33 is given in subsidy. Many think diesel is cheaper than octane. At the moment in the international market, diesel costs more than octane. Diesel price seems lower because of subsidy." He said that if the gas price was increased, the international oil companies would dig wells at their own initiatives and gas production would also be increased. "If the GDP were to reach 7 percent, 24 trillion cubic feet of gas would be needed." Prof Tamim said a seven-year plan had been taken up to make the government organisations stronger. On renewable energy, he said that there was little scope to use wind power. "However, it could be used to some extent in the coastal areas. The use of biogas was possible in the villages. Hydro-electricity is not much available." Energy division secretary Mohammad Mohsin presided. The president's military secretary major general M Aminul Karim, Japanese ambassador Masayuki Inoue, and UNDP assistant resident representative Dr Aminul Islam also spoke. bdnews
