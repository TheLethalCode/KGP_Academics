 Mon Apr 14, DETROIT (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - Chrysler LLC CBS.UL and Nissan Motor Co Ltd on Monday unveiled a production alliance covering small cars and full-size pickup trucks. Under the terms of the deal, Nissan will build a small car for Chrysler using the North American automaker's design in 2010 and Chrysler will build a new full-sized pickup truck for the Japanese automaker using Nissan's plans in 2011, the companies said. Chrysler's new small car will be built in Japan and sold in North America, Europe and other global markets. The pickup truck will be built at Chrysler's plant in Saltillo, Mexico. Chrysler will shift production of pickup trucks from that plant to U.S.-based assembly plants to make room for the Nissan production.
