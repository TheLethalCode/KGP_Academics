<TITLE> Oil, gold rise as bank results loom over dollar </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Hong Kong, April 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil and gold prices gained on Tuesday as the dollar struggled to attract buyers due to signs of a weak earnings season for US banks, which could expose yet more subprime losses and punish stocks worldwide. Asian stocks edged higher, trimming losses from the previous session, but worries about the credit crisis and a weak dollar kept sentiment cautious. The dollar had won support from the Group of Seven nations over the weekend but their words were quickly drowned out and the currency fell back by the end of Monday and remained under pressure early on Tuesday, with one dollar buying 101.25 yen and one euro fetching $1.5815. "The broad weak dollar trend hasn't changed, and the market is returning to economic data and earnings results this week for clues, with the bias towards dollar selling," said a senior dealer at an European bank in Tokyo. The currency's weakness helped spur London Brent crude oil futures to a record high of $110.04, while U.S. crude wavered around $112.00, just shy of another record. Gold followed oil's lead, inching up to $927.40/8.20 by 0117 GMT. Oil and metals prices have also gained from supply problems in recent months and oil's latest surge was helped by bad weather shutting 80 percent of Mexico's oil exports "The system is so tight that any supply problems cause real concern," said Robert Nunan of Mitsubishi Corp in Tokyo. "We just don't have the big cushion any more that we used to have, so it's much easier for money to come in and prop up prices now." SCORCHED AGAIN But stock market investors, who have repeatedly ventured into an apparently rock-bottom market only to get scorched again, were in no rush to buy up shares that could still be vulnerable. "There is no doubt that the impact of the credit squeeze on funding costs has increased for companies that probably had nothing to do with the subprime debacle, and companies that do have seen major writeoffs," said Tony Russell, senior equities adviser at ABN AMRO Morgans in Ipswich, Queensland. "We're going to see more of that in the next quarter or two." Stirring fresh credit worries, Wachovia Corp, the No. 4 U.S. bank, posted a surprise first-quarter loss, prompting it to raise $7 billion of capital, slash its dividend and cut jobs. "After the news about Wachovia, investors couldn't actively buy financials, but they now appear somewhat willing to buy on dips as they are factoring in weak results from the sector," said Zenshiro Mizuno, a senior managing director of the equity trading division at Marusan Securities in Japan. "Still, trade will likely be quiet as investors want to see results from banks such as Citigroup." Japan's Nikkei average clawed back 0.9 percent after falling 3 percent on Monday, while MSCI's measure of other Asia Pacific stocks was up 0.3 percent. One market participant in Japan said investors were returning to blue-chips such as Toyota Motor Corp and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd, which looked cheap after the sell-off, but the market was nervous ahead of U.S. bank earnings. But Japanese government bonds, normally a refuge for rattled equity investors, slipped after U.S. data showing a surprise rise in retail sales, easing some worries about a consumer pull-back causing a deep recession. Prices also fell in anticipation of a 600 billion yen ($5.9 billion) auction of 30-year bonds later in the session. June 10-year futures dropped 0.35 points to 139.55, falling back near a one-month low of 139.13 struck last week.
