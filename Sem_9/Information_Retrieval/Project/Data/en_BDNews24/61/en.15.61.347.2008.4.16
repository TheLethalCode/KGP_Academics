 Dhaka, April 16 (bdnews24.com)The Election Commission has invited two factions of the BNP to separate meetings for Thursday, said EC officials and BNP leaders. BNP leader Khandaker Delwar Hossain is scheduled to sit with EC representatives, including chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda, in midday talks. In a letter, the EC has described Delwar only as BNP leader, not as secretary general, BNP's joint secretary general Goyeshwar Chandra Roy told bdnews24.com by phone. The meeting with Delwar, billed as a courtesy call, has been set for a 12:00pm start, Goyeshwar said. A special messenger delivered the letter Wednesday afternoon. In another letter, the main election office invited acting secretary general Hafizuddin Ahmed of the rival faction to a separate meeting, starting at 10am, public relations officer for the EC M Asaduzzaman told bdnews24.com. Hafizuddin has also been described only as BNP leader in the letter. The talks are meant to find ways to ease the deadlock over EC's planned dialogue with the BNP that had stalled the process of finalising election reforms laws. The EC had earlier wrapped up two rounds of talks with the political parties except for the BNP. bdnew
