 PARIS, April 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thousands of French high school students marched through Paris on Tuesday to protest government plans to cut more than 8,000 teaching jobs, which they said would mean over-crowding in classrooms and fewer subjects. Beatifg drums, swaying to the beat of rap music and chanting slogans, the teenagers took to the streets for the sixth time in three weeks as anger grows over the job cuts which the government says are needed to rein in public spending. "In my school we're going to end up with 40 students in each class. It's completely unacceptable," said Johannes Rebaud, 16, who came with 100 others from Nemours, 70 km southeast of Paris. Education Minister Xavier Darcos has said the number of students in French high schools had declined by 145,000 in the past three years and the state spent 22 percent more on each than the average for OECD countries. "In this context, to demand more teachers' posts no matter what is a mistake," he was quoted as saying by Tuesday's Figaro newspaper, advocating a "New Deal" for French schools. French state schools are supposed to have no more than about 30 students per class. Darcos has denied union complaints that his reform plans would result in a rise to 40. Police said 20,000 people were in the march, while the FIDL students' union put the number at 50,000. The protesters said they needed more teachers, not fewer, and the government was trying to save pennies to the detriment of their future. Marine Pillien, 16, from Le Kremlin-Bicetre in the outskirts of Paris, said her school would lose 12 instructors. "It's a huge number. We won't be able to take certain subjects anymore, like art, drama or Italian," she said. The cuts are one of a series of reforms launched by the government of President Nicolas Sarkozy, which has been struggling to find ways to slash public spending and meet its promise to EU partners to balance the budget by 2012. Teachers' and student unions have been acting together since the cuts were announced and many teachers took part on Tuesday. "The government says it wants our students to succeed, but cutting the number of teachers is not the way," said Martine Hingant, a sports teacher and union member at the march. The march began peacefully in the Republique area of central Paris. On the margins of a previous demonstration on April 3, hooded youths clashed with police after they broke away from the main crowd and tried to smash shop windows. Student demonstrations in France have been plagued for years by "casseurs", or vandals, who seize the opportunity to wreak havoc in affluent city centres. Hundreds of gendarmes in full riot gear lined the route of Tuesday's march to prevent this. More demonstrations have already been plann
