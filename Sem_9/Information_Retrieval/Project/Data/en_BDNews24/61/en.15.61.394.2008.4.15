<TITLE> Markets wary of US bank shocks, oil at high </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Hong Kong, April 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Investors jostled for position on Tuesday as stockmarkets braced for a slew of earnings from US banks, with some heading for the refuge of bonds and gold and others betting that the worst is already priced in. Oil prices hit a record high, helped by a weak dollar, which has given up gains made on supportive remarks from the Group of Seven nations at the weekend. The dollar dithered in a narrow range in cautious Asian trade, standing at 101.23 yen by 0410 GMT, while the euro traded at $1.583, barely changed from Monday's close. "The broad weak dollar trend hasn't changed, and the market is returning to economic data and earnings results this week for clues, with the bias towards dollar selling," said a senior dealer at an European bank in Tokyo. The week should be littered with clues since U.S. banks are due to unveil their latest quarterly results, which could mean turning over more rocks with subprime nasties underneath. The tone was set on Monday by Wachovia Corp, the No. 4 U.S. bank, which posted a surprise first-quarter loss, prompting it to raise $7 billion of capital, slash its dividend and cut jobs. "After the news about Wachovia, investors couldn't actively buy financials, but they now appear somewhat willing to buy on dips as they are factoring in weak results from the sector," said Zenshiro Mizuno, a senior managing director of the equity trading division at Marusan Securities in Japan. "Still, trade will likely be quiet as investors want to see results from banks such as Citigroup." NIKKEI EDGES UP Japan's Nikkei average clawed back 0.5 percent after falling 3 percent on Monday, while MSCI's measure of other Asia Pacific stocks was up 0.3 percent. One market participant in Japan said investors were returning to blue-chips such as Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd and Toyota Motor Corp, which rose 0.8 percent after striking a year low on Monday. Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index rose 1.2 percent as resources firms gained from strong oil and metals prices. With the wind behind the dollar buying dropping noticeably, dollar-denominated oil prices hit record highs, helped by weather problems in Mexico that will restrict supplies. U.S. light crude for May delivery rose 65 cents to $112.41 a barrel, beating its previous record by 20 cents, while London Brent crude rose 61 cents to $110.45 a barrel, surpassing Monday's $110.01 high. "It has some self-fulfilling momentum at the moment," said David Moore, commodities strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. "But there are no specific new fundamental factors that should drive it higher from yesterday." Gold, a safe-haven asset that often tracks oil's gains, inched up to $927.50/8.30 an ounce as investors weighed up the chances of the months of selling in equities continuing. "Market participants are still very much on the long side. We need to see fresh buying from the funds to bid gold up to above $940," said William Kwan, a dealer at Phillip Futures in Singapore. Like equity markets, bond investors were cautious ahead of a potentially rollercoaster U.S. earnings season, and Japanese government bonds backtracked slightly from Monday's gains and prices fell in anticipation of a 600 billion yen ($5.9 billion) auction of 30-year bonds later in the session. June 10-year futures dropped 0.46 points to 139.44, falling back near a one-month low of 139.13 struck last week.
