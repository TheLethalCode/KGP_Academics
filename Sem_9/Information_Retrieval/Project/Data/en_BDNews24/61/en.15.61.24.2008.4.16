<TITLE> China economy slows a touch, inflation stays high </TITLE>

 Beijing, April 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China shrugged off atrocious winter weather and a global credit crunch to post surprisingly strong economic growth of 10.6 percent for the first quarter. The outcome will be welcome to global policy makers, who are looking to big emerging markets such as China to take up some of the slack in the world economy as the United States teeters on the brink of recession. Annual gross domestic product growth dropped from 11.2 percent in the final quarter of 2007, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday, but it beat market forecasts of 10 percent despite a drive by the central bank to rein in lending. With consumer price inflation remaining high at 8.3 percent in the year to March, albeit down from near-12-year highs of 8.7 percent in February, economists said Beijing would be wary of relaxing policy despite fears for China's export prospects. "The headline GDP number was slightly on the strong side and, given that we had the snowstorm and tightening measures in the first quarter, this will give reason for the government to continue with its tightening bias," said Kelvin Lau, an economist at Standard Chartered Bank in Hong Kong. In fact, there was an immediate reaction, the central bank announcing an increase of 0.5 percentage point in big banks' reserve requirements to 16 percent from April 25. It was the 16th increase since the middle of 2006. "The fact that they've moved immediately in response to the data today neatly highlights just how strong the Chinese economy remains at this stage," said Glenn Maguire, an economist at Societe Generale in Hong Kong. The data showed inflation remained largely confined to food, which cost 21 percent more in the first quarter than a year earlier. Consumer prices were up 8.0 percent overall, but only 1.2 percent excluding food. However, economists said price pressures were building up: annual factory-gate inflation leapt to 8.0 percent in the year to March from 6.6 percent in February. "We believe it is crucial to maintain the tightening policy stance to anchor rising inflation expectations. It is still too early for the government to claim victory for their inflation battle," Hong Liang and Yu Song with Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients. They expected the central bank to maintain strict credit controls and to keep pushing up the yuan's exchange rate at a faster pace. Two interest rate rises were likely this year, they added. HOSTAGE TO EXPORTS Standard Chartered and JPMorgan Chase also reiterated their forecasts of higher rates, but some economists said Beijing was likely to alter its policy stance as growth slowed. "Inflation remains a challenge; it remains at a very high level," said Yiping Huang with Citigroup in Hong Kong. "In the short term they will probably want to continue to tighten," he said. "But I suspect that within several months, the growth risks might overtake the inflation risks." The Shanghai stock market closed 1.69 percent lower after the inflation figures, even though they were leaked last week. China has grown by 10 percent a year or more since 2003, catapulting it into fourth place in the global economic rankings. Economists expect it to leapfrog third-placed Germany this year, yet output per head of its 1.3 billion people is only about $2,500 a year compared with about $46,000 in the United States. The statistics office said growth held up despite the spreading impact of the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis and what it called unprecedented ice storms in January and February that disrupted output across much of southern China. "Policies were put into place in an effective way, leading to steady and fast economic growth," the office said. Industrial production and fixed-asset investment both beat forecasts in March, while retail sales -- boosted by inflation -- jumped 21.5 percent from a year earlier. Although the government wants to spur domestic demand, economists said it would be difficult for export-dependent China to insulate itself from weakness in the industrial world. "Export growth will slow down in the second quarter, mainly due to weakening demand from the United States. As you can see, many companies have already felt the pinch," said Zhang Sihyuan, an analyst with Southwest Securities in Beijing.
