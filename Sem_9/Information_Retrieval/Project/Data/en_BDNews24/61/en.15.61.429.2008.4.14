<TITLE> US `milkshake' murderess appeals Hong Kong verdict </TITLE>

 HONG KONG, April 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An American housewife, jailed for life in Hong Kong for drugging her banker husband with a milkshake and bludgeoning him to death, appealed against her murder conviction on Monday after nearly three years in jail. Nancy Kissel, dubbed the "milkshake" murderess, was unanimously found guilty by a seven-person jury after a three-month trial in 2005. She drugged her husband, Robert Kissel, a top Merril Lynch investment banker, with the sedative-laced drink then cracked his skull five times with a metal ornament.

The sensational case inspired a crime book by Joe McGinniss, "Never Enough", which painted an unflattering portrait of Kissel as a cold blooded killer, who wanted to grab her husband's money and flee to the United States to be with her TV repairman lover. The Kissel family suffered a fresh tragedy in 2006 when Robert's brother, Andrew, a property mogul charged with fraud, was found stabbed to death in his Connecticut ho
