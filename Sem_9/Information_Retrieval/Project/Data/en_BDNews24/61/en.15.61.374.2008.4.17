 Dhaka, Apr 17, (bdnews24.com)The Election Commission held separate talks with two groups of BNP leaders Thursday, led by Hafizuddin Ahmed and Chowdhury Tanvir Ahmed Siddiqui respectively. The EC held an hour-long talk with the group led by BNP acting secretary general Hafizuddin, beginning at the EC secretariat at 10.30am, while the second group began their meeting just after midday. Hafizuddin, standing committee member Mahbubur Rahman, Khaleda Zia's adviser Mofazul Karim and former MP Fazlul Azim met with chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda and election commissioners Muhammed Sohul Hussain and M Sakhawat Hussain. Karim told reporters before the meeting that his four-member BNP group would speak to reporters after the meeting ended. The group representing BNP's Delwar-headed faction was led by BNP standing committee member Siddiqui, and included Khaleda Zia's adviser ASM Hannan Shah, joint secretaries general Goyeshwar Chandra Roy, Nazrul Islam Khan and Selima Rahman, and organising secretary Md Shahjahan among others. EC deputy secretary (law) AKM Salimullah told reporters prior to the meetings: "This is a good sign that these talks are taking place." "How fruitful they will be, however, cannot be said until the talks are over," he added. The Election Commission invited the two BNP factions, led by Hafizuddin and Khaleda-appointed secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, to separate meetings, though Delwar said he would personally not attend the talks. In its letter, the EC described Delwar and Hafizuddin only as a 'BNP leaders', but did not address them as secretary generals, acting or otherwise, BNP spokespersons said. The talks are meant to find ways to ease the deadlock over EC's planned dialogue with the BNP that had stalled the process of finalising election reforms laws. The EC had earlier wrapped up two rounds of talks with the political parties except for the BNP. bdnews2
