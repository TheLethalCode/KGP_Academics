 BAGHDAD, April 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fighting erupted in Baghdad's Sadr City overnight after a day's lull, dashing residents' hopes of a let-up in clashes between US and government troops and Shia gunmen who control the streets of the sprawling slum. Angry mourners carried a coffin containing the body of a man killed in the clashes through the streets. A hospital said seven wounded casualties had arrived overnight. Residents swept out the rubble from freshly damaged buildings. An explosion in central Baghdad's Tayaran Square killed five people and wounded nine, police said.

On Sunday the Iraqi government announced it was firing 1,300 soldiers and police who failed to stand and fight during the campaign in the south, an acknowledgment of failures in an operation and weaknesses in some of its forces. US commanders have criticised Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki for rushing into the Basra operation, but they also say it showed the government's willingness to take the initiative against the militias. Basra has been comparatively quiet over the past two weeks after Sadr ordered his fighters off the streets.
