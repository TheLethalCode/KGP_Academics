 LONDON, April 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks and the dollar rose and Wall Street was set for a firmer open on Tuesday after strong US quarterly earnings and firmer US producer prices and manufacturing data. Oil stormed to all-time peaks due to supply concerns in Mexico while other commodities such as rice and gold firmed, boosting resource-related shares. Sterling hit a fresh 11-1/2 year low on a trade-weighted basis and record lows versus the euro after data showing steady inflation and slowing housing markets raised expectations the Bank of England might cut interest rates again this year. Concerns about the health of corporates and banks hit by the credit crisis eased after Johnson & Johnson and Northern Trust posted higher quarterly profits. State Street's quarterly profit surged 69 percent. US data showed producer prices rose a higher-than-expected 1.1 percent in March while core prices came in line with forecast at 0.2 percent. A report by the New York Federal Reserve showed manufacturing growth in New York state showed some stabilisation in April after tumbling to a record low in March. "(The manufacturing survey) suggests the growth outlook may not be quite so dire," said T.J. Marga, fixed income strategist at Royal Bank of Canada Capital Markets in New York. The FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 0.7 percent while the MSCI main world equity index was up 0.2 percent on the day, having hit a two-week low on Monday. U.S. stock futures erased early losses to stand up 0.3 percent, indicating a firmer open on Wall Street. Sterling fell to all-time lows of 80.65 pence per euro after weak British housing and retail sales data. The dollar rose a quarter percent against a basket of major currencies. In the money market, stress is building up in medium-term euro funding, with London interbank offered rates for three-month euro hitting a fresh 3-1/2 month high of 4.76125 percent. U.S. light crude rose as high as $113.66 a barrel. U.S. rice futures rose to an all-time high, extending this year's increase to more than 60 percent, while corn kept within sight of a recent record. Gold also extended gains to $933.40 an ounce. European credit spreads moved a touch tighter. The iTraxx Crossover index, most-widely watched indicator for European credit market sentiment, hit 527 basis points. Emerging sovereign spreads tightened 6 bps while emerging stocks were up 0.2 percent. The June Bund future fell 37 ticks as investors sought riskier stocks at the expense of safe-haven bonds. SLOWDOWN AHEAD Despite Tuesday's U.S. earnings results offering some respite, there is growing evidence of worsening liquidity and credit conditions hitting the real economy hard eight months after the initial wave of the U.S. subprime mortgage fallout hit financial markets. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said British surveyors reported the most widespread fall in house prices in the 30-year history of their survey. Official data showed annual British house price inflation eased to a 19-month low of 6.7 percent in February. The British Retail Consortium said like-for-like retail sales fell in March for the first time in two years, and at the sharpest pace in nearly three years. A closely watched survey by the ZEW research institute showed German investor sentiment deteriorated for the first time in three months in April. "The view that the United States (is) only in a temporary phase of weakening and will soon move towards potential growth is barely tenable any more. That is playing a role. The environment in the euro zone is also weakening," said Peter Meister, economist at BHF Bank. Investors are looking to further earnings data this week to see how corporates performed in the first three months of this year. US firms reporting their Q1 results later include Intel and Washington Mutual. An expected quarterly loss from Wachovia Corp on Monday raised concerns about the health of banks hit by their investment in risky US subprime mortgages. However, earnings results from banks -- many of them pretty weak -- have so far helped reassure investors that they are scrubbing their books clean, putting the credit crunch behind th
