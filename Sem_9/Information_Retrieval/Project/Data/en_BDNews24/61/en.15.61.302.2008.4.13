 Dhaka, April 13 (bdnews24.com)An ongoing heat wave has combined with power generation shortfalls to make life a misery in Dhaka, Khulna and Rajshahi over the last three days. What the Met Office refers to as a 'mild-to-medium heat wave' has blown across the country making life in the capital and other areas unbearable, while the consequent increase in demand for power exacerbates the problem. Load shedding in many areas has increased, with Sunday's estimated load shedding put at 623 megawatts throughout the country. The maximum national production was expected to peak at 3782 MW. DESA said Sunday's demand for power in Dhaka stood at 1250 MW, while load shedding stood at 236 MW. Power Development Board data reveals that Dhaka city's demand for power on Saturday was 1558 MW, while supply stood at 1453 MW. The Met Office said temperatures may drop Monday, with lingering effects remaining in western and central areas. The country's highest temperature on Sunday peaked at 37 degrees Celsius in Rajshahi, with the capital cresting at 34.7 degrees Celsius. However, on Saturday a temperature of 40 degrees Celsius was recorded in Rajshahi. Met Office official Sujit Kumar Dev Sharma told bdnews24.com that there was also a risk of a storm striking in a day or two. After that the temperature should come down, said Sharma, although he cautioned that in general it was due to get hotter leading up to the monsoon, with brief periods of relief when it rains. Monday's weather forecast from the Met office said temporary squally winds, rain or rain with storms are likely in Comilla, Noakhali and Barisal regions in addition to Dhaka, Khulna and Sylhet divisions. Sunday's demand for power in the areas under the PDB in greater Rangpur was 210 MW, while 170 MW was supplied. In the Rajshahi area under the PDB, demand reached 397 MW, while supply was 317 MW. In Khulna demand was 388 MW, while supply was 301 MW. In Barisal, demand was 378 MW and the supply was only 48 MW. In Chittagong, demand was 473 MW, while 378 MW was supplied. In Sylhet the demand was 180 MW, while supply reached 148 MW. bdnews
