 GROS ISLET, St Lucia, April 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Heavy rain caused the third one-day international between West Indies and Sri Lanka to be abandoned after just 18 overs of the hosts' innings on Tuesday. West Indies won the series 2-0 following their two victories in Trinidad. Half-centuries by Mahela Udawatte and Tillakaratne Dilshan led Sri Lanka to a total of 257 for eight and West Indies had reached 81 for two before the downpour. Officials waited over 90 minutes before deciding that the day/night game could not be finished, leaving a large crowd disappointed. Sri Lanka had slumped to 44 for three when the 21-year-old Udawatte, playing just his third international game, joined Chamara Kapugedera to share a stand of 84 before the latter was caught and bowled for 40 by skipper Chris Gayle. Opener Udawatte's 122-ball knock ended on 73 when he was brilliantly stumped down the leg side by wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin off spinner Gayle. Sri Lanka were then boosted by a typically lively performance from Dilshan, who struck 64 in 54 balls and shared a quickfire partnership of 79 with Kaushalya Weeraratne (41). The home team, already without the ill Shivnarine Chanderpaul, had to start their reply without opening batsman Gayle who picked up a groin injury while fielding. West Indies openers Sewnarine Chattergoon (46) and Runako Morton (17) made a decent start but with the game nicely poised and Ramnaresh Sarwan and Marlon Samuels at the crease the weather intervened
