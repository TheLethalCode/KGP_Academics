<TITLE> US lobbyists hopeful for Doha deal despite Colombia </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 GENEVA, April 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A deal to open up world trade in the Doha round is not vulnerable to U.S. politics despite the current deadlock in Washington over the U.S.-Colombia free trade agreement, U.S. business lobbyists said on Wednesday. But the lobbyists, from leading U.S. companies and trade groups gathered in the American Business Coalition for Doha, acknowledged that approval of any deal could collide with the U.S. electoral calendar. The lobbyists, in Geneva to meet negotiators at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) as signs of agreement appear in the long-running Doha round, said the U.S. Congress saw free-trade pacts and multilateral negotiations like Doha differently. "The delegates here need to know that the U.S. business community will fight for it," said Marietta Bernot, global trade and customs adviser at U.S. confectionary maker Mars. Bernot acknowledged that Colombia was a setback. Last week the Democratic-run House of Representatives voted to delay action on the pact indefinitely, prompting President George W. Bush to declare it dead. POLITICS AND ECONOMICS But Bernot said the dispute was about politics, while the Doha trade deal was about economics. "It shouldn't be seen by anyone to mean that the United States can't deliver a trade deal," she told a briefing. American business would push Congress hard to back a good trade deal -- one that covers agriculture, manufacturing and services and leads to real market opening, the lobbyists said. Their message to Congress was that the Doha process was starting to get serious, said Christopher Wenk, senior director, international policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "Based on our observations from the trip there's a real desire to get this process moving... In our view that's progress," he said. Trade diplomats say that ministers may come to Geneva next month to agree the broad outlines of a deal, but it would still require many months to flesh out the details. The European Union's top trade official, Peter Mandelson, has said the Doha round, launched in late 2001, must be completed this year to have any chance of success. Many negotiators argue that a deal needs to be reached while Bush is still in the White House, before a new U.S. administration with different priorities takes office next year. But the lobbyists said it could be hard for any lame-duck session of Congress meeting after the November election to extend the president's fast-track trade negotiating authority. That requires Congress to vote simply 'yes' or 'no' on the whole package rather than picking apart the details, and is seen as essential to the approval of any trade deal. But the U.S. agriculture sector will not know what it is getting in a deal until the detailed work is completed in the third or fourth quarter, and so will not be in a position to lobby congress to pass the agreement. Thus Bush may simply initial the deal and leave it to the new Congress to vote on, said Catherine Bennett, senior vice-president of the National Foreign Trade Council. U.S. industry could live with current proposals that would cap major developing countries' industrial tariffs in a 19-23 percent range, said Doug Goudie, director for international trade policy at the National Association of Manufacturers. But Goudie, noting that manufacturing accounts for two thirds of U.S. exports, said it was vital that big developing countries signed up to additional agreements, in which groups of countries make trade in certain sectors duty-free. "We can live with 19-23 as long as key markets especially advanced developing countries are open to our exports," he said. The lobbyists said that liberalisation of services such as banking and telecoms must be part of any Doha deal. "It has to be there or you risk losing the support of the American business community," said Wenk. But Bennett said that national security concerns would make it difficult for the U.S. to back the key demand of developing countries such as India in the services talks -- greater movement of temporary workers.
