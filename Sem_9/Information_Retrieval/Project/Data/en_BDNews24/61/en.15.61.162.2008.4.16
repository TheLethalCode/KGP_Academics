 Dhaka, April 16 (bdnews24.com)Agriculture adviser CS Karim and army chief Moeen U Ahmed Wednesday urged people to build a habit of eating more potato to cut pressure on rice as the core food. They made the call from a press conference after inaugurating a "potato feast" at Radisson Water Garden Hotel. The food promotion that will continue through to April 22 was designed to popularise the use of potato and showcase various local and international recipes that can be prepared from potato. More than 140 potato recipes will be on display. "In the backdrop of a decline in the production of rice, bumper potato growth this year is good news," CS Karim said. "Nutritional requirements may be met with an increased potato intake alongside rice," he said. General Moeen said: "The country witnessed five natural calamities in the past five years. The disasters damaged 20 lakh tonnes of rice output. We should build the habit of eating more potato to ease pressure on rice." This year, 80 lakh tonnes of potato have been produced and 22 lakh tonnes can be preserved. In a statement, Radisson said diners at the food promotion would also get a chance to win a "weekend package" that includes one night stay for a couple with dinner and breakfast. It mentioned that the United Nations also declared 2008 as the International Year of the Potato to raise "awareness of the importance of the potato in addressing issues of global concern, including hunger, poverty and threats to the environment". "Not only are potatoes great in taste, they are one of the most nutritious foods one can eat. One might be surprised to know that a medium sized potato has fewer calories than a grapefruit," the statement said. Potatoes are rich in carbohydrates, with highest protein content in the family of root and tuber crops and also very rich in vitamin C. A single medium-sized potato contains about half the recommended daily intake and contains a fifth of the recommend daily value of potassium. The first potato has its roots in the windswept Andes Mountains of South America. Taken by the Spanish to Europe in the 16th century, it quickly spread across the globe: today potatoes are grown on an estimated 195 000 sq km, or 75000 square miles, of farmland, from China's Yunnan plateau and the subtropical lowlands of India, to Java's equatorial highlands and the steppes of Ukraine. bdnew
