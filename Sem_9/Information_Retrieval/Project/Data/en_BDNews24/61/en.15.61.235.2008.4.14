 Dhaka, April 14 (bdnews24.com)  The government started paying direct subsidies to marginalised boro farmers Monday to help them recover the cost of diesel used for irrigation. Farmers who have grown boro paddy on less then 2.5 acres of land are eligible to receive the subsidy, which pays Tk 545 per acre of cultivated land. Agriculture adviser CS Karim said the government would pay Tk 250 crore in diesel subsidies to 67 lakh farmers in one month under the programme. He called the country's farmers national heroes. Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam inaugurated the subsidy programme Monday at Dighi Union Parishad in Manikganj, saying the government was giving special priority to agriculture this year. The government had allocated Tk 3,000 crore to the agriculture sector for the current fiscal year, but the allocation might be upwardly adjusted to as much as Tk 6,000 by the end of the year, he said. The revised budget for agriculture and agriculture related sectors would total one fourth of the total budget, he added. The finance adviser asked local authorities to undertake measures to ensure that farmers get due prices for their agricultural output. He suggested that farmers form cooperative societies in every union that would help them sell crops at fair prices. Adviser CS Karim asked farmers to be careful about the use of fertilizer, and asked them to use every inch of land to fulfill the demand of food in the country. He gave them credit for the year's bumper potato crops. Karim also advised farmers to learn about useful new farming methods and technologies, and to be united in demanding fair prices for crops. The agriculture adviser later cut the first paddy of the boro harvest in Dewan Bari village in Amin Bazar Union. Ad Spijker, country representative of Food and Agriculture Organisation, was also present. bdnews
