 Dhaka, April 16 (bdnew24.com)Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said Wednesday that pre-dialogue talks with the political parties had reached the last phase. Emphasis is being given on wrapping up the process properly over the next few days, he told reporters after an hour-long meeting with housing and public works adviser Ghulam Quader and local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal at the housing and public works ministry. Hossain Zillur said guidelines would be formulated on the basis of the recommendations received from the political parties in the pre-dialogue talks. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed would fix the time-line and format for the dialogue on the basis of the guidelines, the adviser added. "Some of our preparatory work is yet to be completed. We are making every effort so that the dialogue can be held properly, and so we can go smoothly into the formal dialogue after the pre-dialogue talks end." In light of the recent meeting with one faction of BNP, asked whether talks would be held with the other faction, the adviser said: "We have invited all political parties. We will sit with those who respond to our invitation." Asked whether the government would take any steps regarding the BNP pro-reform faction's demand for fixing a code of conduct for political leaders, he said: "Whatever we do, we will do it after consulting the people." bdnew
