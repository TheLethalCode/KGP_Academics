<TEXT>
 HARARE, April 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A court in Zimbabwe acquitted an American and a British reporter on Wednesday who had been charged with covering Zimbabwe's March 29 election without official accreditation. "They have been acquitted," said Beatrice Mtetwa, a lawyer for the journalists. "The state failed to prove that they had committed a crime." Pulitzer prize winner Barry Bearak, an American working for the New York Times, and British freelance reporter Stephen Bevan were arrested on April 3 and released on bail of 300 million Zimbabwean dollars ($7.50). The New York Times said that while in custody, Bearak had suffered injuries as a result of falling from the bunk in his cell to the concrete floor, 7 feet (2 metres) below. It made no suggestion that foul play was involved. Authorities have limited the international media's access to Zimbabwe. Two South African technicians working for a satellite television service company were also arrested by Zimbabwean police, but were later released and have since returned home. The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, a press freedom watchdog, had voiced concern over the arrests and called for the immediate release of all journalists in detention.
