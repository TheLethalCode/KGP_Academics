<TEXT>
 Rome, April 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Conservative billionaire Silvio Berlusconi was elected Italian prime minister on Monday, but there are several steps before he can take office in early May. Following are the key events expected in the weeks ahead: April 29 - The new parliament meets for the first time. It is expected to spend a few days choosing a speaker of the lower house and president of the Senate, and selecting committee heads. May - President Giorgio Napolitano is expected to start meetings with parliamentary heads and party chiefs to verify that Berlusconi has a majority. Since the election result seems clear, this could move quickly. May (probably week of May 5) - Napolitano will ask Berlusconi to present his cabinet list for approval. He has the right to reject ministers. Probably by May 9 - Berlusconi and ministers go to the presidential palace for a swearing-in ceremony. Until this moment, outgoing Prime Minister Romano Prodi stays in power in a caretaker capacity.
