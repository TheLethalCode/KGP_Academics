 LONDON, April 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fallout from losses at General Electric and other factors pointing to a US recession hit global stock markets hard on Monday while the dollar stayed firm after the G7 expressed concerns over currency swings. European stocks dropped for the fifth session in a row as weak corporate results continued to spook investors. Philips Electronics reported a 28 percent drop in core profit, below average analyst expectations, hurt by its loss-making TV business and acquisition-related charges. It added to angst from last Friday's weak earnings posted by US conglomerate General Electric and news of US consumer sentiment at a 26-year low, which fuelled worries about the scale of the US economic downturn. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down nearly 1 percent, bringing this year's losses to more than 15 percent. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei average index closed 3.1 percent lower while shares across the rest of Asia, gauged by MSCI's regional index, fell 2.2 percent. "We've seen the immediate effect of the credit crisis on financials and there is a second round effect where it hits activities and profit growth in broader corporates," said Simon Doyle, head of strategy at Schroder Investment Management in Sydney. "For most of this year, we're going to be watching profit growth, or lack thereof. That's the big risk to equity markets now." Finance chiefs from the Group of Seven rich nations grappled at the weekend with proposals for tightening global scrutiny of banks and pressed the private sector to step up efforts to settle the financial turmoil still emanating from the US mortgage market meltdown. SWING The G7 also unexpectedly voiced concern about sharp swings in major currencies, initially sending the dollar higher. But gains were capped by the persistent worries about the health of the US economy. It was the first time a communique has mentioned major currencies since 2000. Dealers doubted that central banks would intervene and trading was returning to earlier patterns. The euro fell as low as $1.5672 in Asian trading according to Reuters data. But it recovered most of the losses to trade at $1.5791, down just 0.1 percent on the day. It hit a record $1.5912 last week. The dollar eased 0.4 percent to 100.95 yen. Euro zone government bonds rose, adding to the previous session's chunky gains as worries about corporate profits weighed on stocks, underpinning demand for safe-haven government debt. The two-year Schatz yield fell 2 basis points to 3.406 percent while the 10-year Bund yield eased 3 basis points to 3.891 perce
