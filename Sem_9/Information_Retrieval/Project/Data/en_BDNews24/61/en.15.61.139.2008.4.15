 JAKARTA, April 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indonesian police said on Tuesday two detained members of Islamic militant group Jemaah Islamiah (JI) admitted that they had tried to travel to Syria to forge ties with foreign radical groups. A police official told Reuters on Monday the men, identified as Abdul Rohim bin Thoyib and Agus Purwantoro, were caught in Malaysia and then transferred to a detention centre in Jakarta.

Purwantoro, a doctor from Surabaya, East Java, was wanted for his role in the beheadings of three Christian highschool girls in Poso in 2005 and two other attacks the same year. JI, which wants to create an Islamic state in Southeast Asia, was responsible for a series of attacks in the region including 2002 bomb attacks in Bali in which over 200 people were kill
