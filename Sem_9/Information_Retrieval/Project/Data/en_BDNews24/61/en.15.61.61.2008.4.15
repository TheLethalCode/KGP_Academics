 NEW DELHI, April 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian opposition lawmakers protested against rising prices in parliament on Tuesday, halting proceedings in the lower house, as the finance minister said more measures to ease price pressures were planned. Indian inflation jumped to its highest in more than three years in late March, reaching 7.41 percent and raising political tensions.

If consumer anger is not contained, it could shape India's political future as its billion-plus people gear up for general elections sometime between October and May.
