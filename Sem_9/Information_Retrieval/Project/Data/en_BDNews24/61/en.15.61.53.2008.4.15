<TEXT>
 TOKYO, April 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda said on Tuesday the government had no time to call a general election, after the main opposition leader said he expected the country to go to the polls soon. Fukuda's support rates have sagged to less than 30 percent in some opinion polls, compared with around 60 percent when he took office in September, largely due to his struggles with the opposition-dominated upper house of parliament. "We are not in a situation where we can call an election," Fukuda told reporters when asked about Democratic Party leader Ichiro Ozawa's comments. "There are various problems and I think the government is too busy." Ozawa told a news conference he hoped an April 27 by-election in Yamaguchi, in southwest Japan, would provide momentum for the general election, which he expected would be held soon. "This is a regional election and it is not as if it is unrelated to the government," Fukuda said. "We don't want to force our opinions on the regions, but listen to their voices and incorporate them in our policies." Fukuda's cabinet came under fresh attack on Tuesday after the introduction of a new health insurance system for those aged over 75, aimed at reducing the burden on younger people in the rapidly ageing nation, resulted in errors and sparked confusion among the elderly. Fukuda told reporters there had been misunderstandings about the new system and that better explanations were necessary. The prime minister has been planning a trip to Europe this month, as part of the lead up to a G8 summit he is due to host in July, but Kyodo news quoted an unnamed government source as saying on Tuesday he would cancel most of the trip. Kyodo quoted the source as saying Fukuda would be needed in parliament at home so would likely cut visits to Britain, France and Germany, all members of the Group of Eight industrial nations, leaving only the Russian leg of the trip on April
