<TEXT>
 Paris, April 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks fell in early trade on Monday, dropping for the fifth session in a row as Philips Electronics became the latest company to spook investors with weak results. At 0825 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.7 percent at 1,276.12 points. The index has lost about 4 percent over the past week, and is down 15 percent on the year. Weak earnings from General Electric on Friday cemented the view that the US economy was tipping into recession, sparking a stock sell-off around the world. Philips Electronics shed 3.1 percent on Monday after reporting a 28 percent drop in core profit, below average analyst expectations, hurt by its loss-making TV business and acquisition-related charges. Banks were also among the biggest laggards, with the DJ Stoxx banking index down 1.1 percent. Banco Santander dropped 1.2 percent, UniCredit was down 1.3 percent, and UBS down 2.9 percent. Credit Suisse dropped 3.4 percent. Speculation intensified over the weekend that Credit Suisse would announce hefty writedowns in the coming weeks, with Swiss newspapers pointing to value reductions of 3 to 5 billion Swiss francs. The bank declined to comment. "Despite the optimism of UBS CEO Marcel Rohner that the firm is over the worst of its problems, elsewhere Citigroup and Merrill Lynch are set to unearth further losses this week, proving that we are still yet to have heard the last of writedowns," Simon Denham, managing director at Capital Spreads wrote in a note. "Billions more dollars are due to knock US banking profits... and uncertainty is growing as not even the banks know exactly how much more their balance sheets have been depleted by. Such was the abuse and misselling of these mortgage backed securities that the markets are set for another turbulent few weeks." Banking stocks have been hit over the past nine months by the debacle in the risky US subprime mortgage market that forced many banks to announce massive asset writedowns and emergency capital increases. Later in the week, investors will comb through quarterly results from JPMorgan Chase & Co, due on Wednesday, Merrill Lynch & Co, due on Thursday, and Citigroup Inc, due on Friday, expected to shed light on the global credit crisis. Mining shares also retreated along with base metal prices. Rio Tinto was down 2.5 percent, and Anglo American down 2.6 percent. British Airways lost 1.9 percent after Morgan Stanley downgraded its rating on the airline to "underweight" from "equal weight" and slashed its price target to 120 pence from 245 pence, citing "increased evidence of 2009 earnings risk, as well as increased pressures from a troubled move to T5 and an aggressive pilots' union." Among the few stocks on the rise, French retailer Carrefour gained 1.8 percent. Blue Capital, a holding company owned by billionaire Bernard Arnault and property group Colony Capital, said on Friday it had raised its stake in the group to 10.7 percent. Food group Danone rose 2 percent after reporting a 19 percent rise in quarterly sales and saying it was on course to meet its 2008 targets for sales and earnings growth. Around Europe, Germany's DAX index was down 0.9 percent, UK's FTSE 100 index down 0.7 percent and France's CAC 40 down 0.4 percent. On the macro front, investors will keep an eye on US retail sales data for March, expected at 1230 GMT, for more clues on the outlook for the world's biggest economy. "All the negative factors that weigh on households' confidence intensified in March and early April: gasoline prices surged to a new record high, employment continued to fall in March, home prices probably extended their losses, credit conditions remain tight and the stock markets are barely 10 percent down from the start of the year... Nothing to fuel optimism for today's retail sales data for March," Global Equities analysts wrote in a no
