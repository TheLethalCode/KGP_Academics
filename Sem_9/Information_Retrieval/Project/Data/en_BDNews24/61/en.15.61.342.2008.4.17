 Meherpur, April 17 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League presidium member Amir Hossain Amu Thursday advised the party's leadership and rank and file to be cautious over its demand to have party chief Sheikh Hasina released from detention. "There are conspiracies against the party. Do not be over enthusiastic in your demand for the immediate release of our leader," said Amu at a meeting in Sadar upazila in Meherpur to mark Mujibnagar Day. "We have to protect our leader and democracy through careful programmes," Amu said. The presidium member stressed the importance of the party remaining united in defence of "our hard-earned democracy". Amu also called upon the party faithful to remain cautious during the crises period, saying: "It will jeopardise the country if we make any more mistakes." On a separate issue, the AL leader took a swipe at the caretaker administration, saying they had demonstrably failed to take any action against known "war criminals" and anti-liberation forces in the country. "While the Awami League has to take permission to hold a simple meeting during the emergency, Islamist organisations, including the anti-liberation force Jamaat-e-Islami, stage demonstrations without permission," he said. "The government failed to take action against them," he added. bdnews2
