 Dhaka, April 16 (bdnews24.com)  The GP-BCB Academy team Wednesday conceded a huge nine-wicket defeat to Pakistan in their second match in the tri-nation Grameenphone Academy Cup at the Birshreshtho Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium in Chittagong. The Pakistan Academy squad romped to victory, making 180 for one in 38.4 overs after bowling the hosts out for a paltry 177 with two balls to spare. Pacer Mahbubul Alam Robin dispatched Pakistani opener Ahmed Shezad for 18 to draw first blood for the home side, but the early scalp proved to be a rarity as one-down Khalid Lalif and opener Khurram Manzoor both struck fine unbeaten fifties to steer their side home. Lalif rattled out 84 off 89 balls, smashing 12 fours and three sixes, while Manzoor managed a very respectable 116-ball 68, which featured nine fours. Earlier, the hosts failed to establish a healthy total as Muhammad Amir (4/21), Azharullah (2/24) and Anwar Ali (2/40) shared eight wickets to wipe the Bangladesh innings. Middle order Nasir Hossain gained the top score with 36, followed by tail-ender Nazmul Hossain on 28. Delwar Hossain and Suhrawardi Shuvo both struck 26. Nazmul and Delwar added 47 runs for the ninth wicket to save the hosts from further humiliation before the latter became Amir's third victim in the final over. Amir also removed Nazmul to stop Bangladesh at 177 all out in 49.4 overs. bd
