<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 17 (bdnews24.com) -- The acting Khatib of Baitul Mukarram National Mosque, Mufti Mohammad Nuruddin, said Thursday the basis of equal rights between the sexes should be determined on qualifications, work experience and responsibilities. The acting chief cleric of the national mosque made his remarks to reporters after submitting recommendations on the national women's development policy to law and religious affairs adviser AF Hassan Ariff. On the inheritance law, Nuruddin, however, cautioned: "The Quran is specific about inheritance law and the guidance of the Quran cannot be changed." "Respective religious laws will be applicable to individuals from different religions. If any women earn property, it will belong to her in its entirety," said the acting Khatib. Regarding equality between the sexes, the religious leader said equal rights should be based on equal responsibilities, although he pointed to certain sections within the women policy that remained problematic. "Those who prepared the policy failed to understand the point we are objecting to. The inheritance law cannot change the guidelines of the Quran." Nuruddin claimed that no Muslim country accepted the Convention for Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women regarding the ownership of property. Urging calm from religious quarters, the acting Khatib said he hoped the caretaker administration would consider the recommendations in detail. Islamist organisations have clashed with police on several occasions since the announcement of the policy on International Women's Day on March 8, 2008. Then, on March 27, the government formed an 18 member committee, headed by Nuruddin to review the policy. After receiving the committee's recommendations, the religious affairs adviser told reporters that they would be considered in consultation with the women and children affairs ministry and others concerned bodies. The adviser declined to respond to queries over the fate of the policy in light of the wide-spread protests from religious quarters. bdnews24.com/
