<TITLE> Georgia: Russia must stop breaching sovereignty </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TBILISI, April 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Georgia on Thursday demanded that Russia revoke all decisions that breached its sovereignty after Moscow said it would establish closer ties with two Georgian rebel regions. "We demand that Russia cancel all the decisions which breach the sovereignty of Georgia," Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili told ministers at a cabinet meeting. NATO's chief on Wednesday called on Russia to reverse a decision to establish legal links with Georgia's breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. "NATO and the international community also demand not just to soften this move but to revise it and cancel it. This is extremely important," Saakashvili said. Georgia has condemned Moscow's move as a breach of international law, while a senior U.S. official said Russia was engaging in "political mischief".
