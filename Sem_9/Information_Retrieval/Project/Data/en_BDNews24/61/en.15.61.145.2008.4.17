<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 17 (bdnews24.com)  Leaders of a BNP faction said Thursday they would sit with the Election Commission, together with the other faction, if the EC invited Khandaker Delwar Hossain to dialogue on reforms. The assurance came after a meeting with the main election office. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's adviser ASM Hannan Shah told reporters that the BNP factions would unite in 72 hours from the invitation and join EC talks together. Delwar stayed away from Thursday's talks as he was not addressed as secretary general in the invitation letter by the EC. BNP standing committee member Chowdhury Tanvir Ahmed Siddiqui led a delegation to the EC talks. Tanvir said: "The talks were held without any agenda as the meeting was a courtesy call." Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda and colleagues Muhammed Sohul Hussain and M Sakhawat Hussain represented the EC. The talks were preceded by a meeting of another BNP delegation led by disputed secretary general Hafizuddin Ahmed. bdn
