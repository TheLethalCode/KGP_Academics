 Beijing, April 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China, where fake DVDs and designer gear are on sale on most street corners, has made great progress fighting intellectual property piracy but people still have a low awareness of the problem, officials said on Thursday. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the trade in pirated consumer goods has reached $200 billion a year, equivalent to 2 percent of world trade, with many fakes coming from China.

Xu Chao, Deputy Director General National Copyright Administration, said it was often not as simple as it seemed to close such stores. "Many malls let out counters, and each counter is essentially run independently, and if they do something illegal you'd have to shut the whole mall. So this is a complicated question," Xu said.
