 KUALA LUMPUR, April 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Malaysian opposition party, defying a police warning, said it will stage a rally on Monday marking the end of a ban that barred politician Anwar Ibrahim from seeking public office. Parti Keadilan vice-president Azmin Ali said he expected several thousand people to attend the rally, scheduled at 9 p.m. (1300 GMT) in the capital.

For the first time in 40 years, the opposition denied the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition a two-thirds parliamentary majority and seized control of five states. Barisan's poor showing has sparked some calls for Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi to resign, although Abdullah has insisted he will not step down.
