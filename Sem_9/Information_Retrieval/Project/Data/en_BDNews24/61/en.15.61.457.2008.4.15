 ROME, April 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Silvio Berlusconi, who swept to power in Italy's latest election, vowed to do everything possible to keep Alitalia in the air and said "tens" of business owners were ready to invest in the struggling airline. Berlusconi said the airline's survival would be one of the first "emergencies" he would tackle after taking office. He told local television he had held a meeting about Alitalia on Monday evening as polling results showed he had won a clear majority in both houses of parliament.

Alitalia has even entered talks with airline industry association IATA about possible guarantees to allow it to keep using the organisation's settlements system if it were to go into administration. Sergio Romano, a political analyst and columnist at the Corriere della Sera newspaper, told foreign journalists at a roundtable discussion on Monday he did not expect Berlusconi to find an alternative to Air France-KLM's offer despite his opposition to it. "He will have to realise that there is nothing to be done," he said. "I think he will give it to the French." Air France-KLM abandoned talks to buy Alitalia after the airline's unions refused to sign the deal, which would lead to the loss of about 10 percent of the work for
