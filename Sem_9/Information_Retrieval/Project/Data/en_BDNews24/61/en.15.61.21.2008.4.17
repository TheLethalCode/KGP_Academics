<TEXT>
 LONDON, April 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Joan Hunter Dunn, genteel muse to Britain's Poet Laureate John Betjeman and the inspiration for one of his best known poems, has died at the age of 92. Betjeman, who famously complained in old age that his one regret was not having had enough sex, worshipped her in verse -- but his love was always unrequited. "I am weak from your loveliness, Joan Hunter Dunn," he declared in "A Subaltern's Love Song" which he wrote after their wartime meeting at the Ministry of Information.

That flight of fancy caused a panic just as the poem was about to be published in 1945 as she had by then married civil servant Wycliffe Jackson. Hillier said the publishers "very quickly approached her and very characteristically she said she had no objection whatsoever." After her husband died of a heart attack while working in Rhodesia, she returned to England in the 1960s where Betjeman helped her find school places for her sons. The English rose, who died in a London nursing home aged 92, was always flattered at being immortalised and once recalled in a newspaper interview that Betjeman had skilfully woven his romantic fantasy with an accurate depiction of her young life.
