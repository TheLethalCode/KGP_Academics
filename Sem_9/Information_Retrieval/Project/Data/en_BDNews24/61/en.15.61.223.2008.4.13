 Dhaka, April 13 (bdnews24.com) -- The council of advisers Sunday approved an ordinance which aims to raise standards in the fish and animal feed sector, a government spokesman said. The new legislation will provide market watchdogs with added firepower in the battle against businessmen operating in the sector without a licence. Anyone caught producing, processing, importing and exporting, marketing, selling or distributing fish and animal feed without a licence now risks a year behind bars and a fine of Tk 50,000. The cabinet approved the new ordinance at its weekly meeting, chaired by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed at his office. "From now on, the names of all ingredients as well as the production and expiry date must be written on fish and animal feed packaging," the CA's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim told reporters after the meeting. The press secretary said one of the underlying aims of the new legislation was to boost commercial cultivation and production of fish. It will also benefit the overall development of poultry and dairy farms, ensuring quality in addition to adding dynamism to the industry in the export market, Munaim said. "In addition to this it will increase the supply of protein in the domestic market," he said. bdnews24.c
