 REGENSDORF, Switzerland, April 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Referees at Euro 2008 will come down hard on players who use excessive force or show dissent if they follow instructions they were given on Thursday.

"Any players involved in mass confrontation have to realise that the main protester(s), including any who run over to join in, will get a yellow card." The list ends with a note to team coaches, advising them that they will be "left to do their jobs" in the technical area immediately in front of the team bench provided they act responsibly. "If a coach openly criticises the referee, action will be taken to curb his behaviour," the instructions added. The directives do not include any radical changes to existing practice in European competition but instead highlight the areas in which referees will be asked to place particular emphasis during Euro 2008. UEFA president Michel Platini said last month that the organisation would use the tournament to call for more respect within the game with individual campaigns addressing the need to respect opponents, national anthems and referee
