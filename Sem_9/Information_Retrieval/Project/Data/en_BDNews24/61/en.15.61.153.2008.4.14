 BRISBANE, Australia, April 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand rewarded opener Jesse Ryder for his good form in the one-day series against England by naming him among their 20 contracted players on Monday. Ryder, 23, made his limited-overs international debut against England this year and averaged 49 in five matches. The burly left-hander blotted his copybook when he punched a bar window and damaged his hand but New Zealand Cricket has given him another chance. Other new faces on the list are young fast bowler Tim Southee, who made a sparkling test debut against England last month, Aaron Redmond and Daniel Flynn. Craig Cumming, Matthew Bell, Michael Papps and Mathew Sinclair have all been discarded. The list is also missing experienced players Stephen Fleming, Shane Bond, Lou Vincent and Craig McMillan, who have either retired or joined the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL). James Marshall has been recalled following good form in the domestic competition. "Contracts are awarded to the 20 players who have the greatest likely future value to the Blackcaps in the next 12 months," team general manager Lindsay Crocker said in a statement. "Players who have missed out on contracts can play their way into the Blackcaps through domestic performances and can expect to pick up major association contracts." New Zealand Cricket contracted players for the year June 1 2008 to May 31 2009. Daniel Flynn, James Franklin, Peter Fulton, Mark Gillespie, Gareth Hopkins, Jamie How, James Marshall, Chris Martin, Michael Mason, Brendon McCullum, Kyle Mills, Iain O'Brien, Jacob Oram, Jeetan Patel, Aaron Redmond, Jesse Ryder, Tim Southee, Scott Styris, Ross Taylor, Daniel Vettor
