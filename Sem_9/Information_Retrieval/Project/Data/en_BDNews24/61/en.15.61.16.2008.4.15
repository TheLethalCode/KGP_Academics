 Dhaka, April 15 (bdnews24.com)  South Korea has doubled the quota of Bangladeshi job recruits for the period of March-2008 to February-2009, foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury said Tuesday. "This progress is in line with our new seven point plan for expatriate workers," said Iftekhar Ahmed, who is also adviser in charge of expatriate welfare and overseas employment. The quota of Bangladeshi workers for recruitment in the republic has been raised to 8,000, according to foreign ministry. Expressing satisfaction with the increase, the adviser directed the relevant authorities for "speedy and transparent selection process under this employment permit system scheme". Stressing the need to upgrade workers' skills, he said: "If we can adequately meet the demand to the satisfaction of the employers in Korea, next year our quota can be much more. We must bear in mind that these jobs call for some specified skills." He said the increase in quota was also a reflection of good relations with the Republic of Korea, and hoped for greater economic cooperation between the two countries in future. bd
