 MILAN, April 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Shares in Italian road and building companies surged on Tuesday on hopes of renewed spending with Silvio Berlusconi's election as prime minister, but his Mediaset SpA broadcaster fell after a downgrade. Shares in ailing flag carrier Alitalia were suspended limit up. Air France-KLM broke off privatisation talks for the cash-strapped airline this month and Berlusconi vowed on Tuesday to do everything necessary to keep it flying. Berlusconi, a conservative media tycoon and one of Italy's richest men, was elected to a third term as prime minister with a strong mandate in elections held on Sunday and Monday. On Tuesday he repeated campaign promises to cut taxes and sell public property to trim a crushing public debt burden. He has also vowed infrastructure spending to boost the European Union's fourth-biggest economy, including revived plans for the world's biggest suspension bridge to link mainland Italy and Sicily. In a research note, investment bank Abaxbank said, "With the centre-right's election win ... we believe that all shares linked to infrastructure and those in niche sectors with strong business talent will mostly end up having a strong advantage." However, insurers and banks probably would be penalised since Giulio Tremonti, who is tipped to be the next economy minister, would like to exclude them from cuts in corporate tax, Abaxbank said in a note. Italy's largest builder Impregilo SpA was up 2.7 percent at 1042 GMT as the DJ Stoxx index of European construction companies was down about 0.6 percent. Impregilo had headed a consortium to build the Sicily bridge under Berlusconi's 2001-2006 government but the outgoing centre-left government scrapped the plan. Construction company Astaldi SpA also firmed 2.46 percent. CONCRETE HOPES Among toll-road operators, Autostrada Torino Milano SpA was up 5.37 percent and Atlantia SpA firmed 5.04 percent. The previous government had thwarted a takeover of Atlantia by Spain's Abertis Infraestructuras SA. Mediaset, which rose more than 10 percent since mid-March on hopes of a Berlusconi win, sank after early gains and was down 3.3 percent. Cazenove downgraded the stock to "underperform" from "neutral". It cited Italy's slowing economy and increasing penetration of digital terrestrial television that is cutting into audiences. Berlusconi's election will "put paid to any remaining left-wing hopes that new legislation might be passed that would make life more difficult for incumbent commercial media companies such as Mediaset. However, that looks to be where the positives end", it said. UBS said Mediaset was facing the same economic risks as competitors with few regulatory gains likely. Publishing company Arnoldo Mondadori Editore SpA, controlled by Berlusconi's Fininvest SpA Holding company, was down about 1 percent. Asset manager Mediolanum SpA, which is partly owned by Fininvest, was down 0.55 percent at 3.9375 euros. The spread between Italian 10-year bonds and benchmark German Bunds widened to 54 basis points, its biggest gap since March 27. The move is in line with bonds from other so-called peripheral European countries and is unlikely to be linked to the election, traders sa
