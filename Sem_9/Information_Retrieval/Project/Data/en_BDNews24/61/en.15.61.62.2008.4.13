 Dhaka, Apr 13 (bdnews24.com)  Here comes Pahela Baishakh again, with Bangalees set to celebrate the first day of the New Year 1415 amid the traditional burst of colour and festivities. The new year will be welcomed at midnight Monday with the customary Tagore song "Esho Hey Baishak Esho Esho" and candlelight vigils for peace. The president and the chief adviser gave separate statements Sunday, on the eve of the Bangla New Year. They urged all to work together, putting aside all differences, for the future of the country. President Iajuddin Ahmed said he hoped that a welfare-oriented spirit would be realised in all aspects of national life, with people setting aside all schisms of the past. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed urged all peopleirrespective of religion, caste, creed or political divideto contribute to a just, enlightened society and welfare-oriented democracy. "Pahela Baishakh is the day for leaving behind the old and welcoming the new." Numerous social and cultural organisations will hold a host of New Year programmes, though tight security measures have been taken in the capital to prevent any disturbance of celebrations. The Rapid Action Battalion and other security forces will be deployed around the Ramna Batamul, the central venue of the Pahela Baishak. Authorities have installed close circuit cameras around the Ramna Park. Dhaka University has become another of the main venues for celebrating the New Year over the years, with various cultural organisations hosting a multitude of programmes on campus throughout the day. The Institute of Fine Arts is getting ready to stage its annual peace procession from 9am on the morning of the first day of the New Year. The arts students have been fashioning the traditional painted masks for their New Year parade, over 700 of them laid along the pavement of the institute providing a fantastic burst of colour. The celebration at Ramna Batamul will begin with the sunrise. The New Year will be welcomed with lighted candles for peace, followed by song and dance recitations. There will be stalls selling the customary panta-ilish at Ramna and the day's main melas or fairs will be held at Ramna Udyan and Suhrawardi Udyan, along with hundreds of smaller fairs and stalls at community centres and outdoor venues throughout the city. History says the Mughal emperor Akbar first introduced what is now the Bangla calender, with Baishakh as its first month, for the convenience of collecting revenue. Akbar would meet his subjects on this day and sweets were distributed. With the passing of time Pahela Baishakh became the national festival of Bangalees. It is celebrated throughout Bangla-speaking communities, irrespective of religion, caste or creed. bdnew
