 MANCHESTER, England, April 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manager Alex Ferguson said Manchester United had beaten their nerves and a very good Arsenal side in Sunday's 2-1 victory at Old Trafford. Trailing to an Emmanuel Adebayor goal, United hit back with a penalty from Cristiano Ronaldo and an Owen Hargreaves free-kick to go six points clear of Chelsea, who play Wigan Athletic on Monday, with four Premier League games to go. "We got over a nervous day today," said Ferguson. "We knew Arsenal are such a good team and in games between the club in recent years there has been nothing in them. "That was a big, big game today and we have come through that. We were a bit nervous at times but we have come through it. It was a significant result. "We have a week's rest now to get the players freshened up and then it's Blackburn in a derby game and then Chelsea. If we win the next two games we are champions." Ferguson felt the introduction of substitutes Carlos Tevez and Anderson with the score at 1-1 was a key moment, but he also paid tribute to Arsenal's contribution to an "incredible game." He added: "Arsenal were unlucky not to get something out of the game. You could not have asked for more from a team than Arsenal produced. They gave their biggest effort and we still managed to win it." ARSENAL OUT Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger conceded his side could no longer win the title after falling nine points behind United. He said the penalty decision for hand-ball against William Gallas could have gone either way and said that Gilberto had made no contract with Patrice Evra for the decisive free kick 20 minutes from the end. "I believe those two decisions made a big difference but we have to take it," he said. "Overall I am very proud of the performance of my team and we have to continue to produce the kind of football we produce," he said. Wenger praised his side's spirit after the disappointment of their Champions League quarter-final exit to Liverpool in midweek. Despite ending a third successive season empty-handed, the Frenchman vowed to stick to his footballing principles in a bid to bring silverware to the Emirates Stadium. "The difference between success and failure this season has been very little," he said. "We have to accept we will not win the title and that is difficult to swallow because I don't feel there is a difference in quality between us and Chelsea and Manchester United. "I am not an idealist, don't worry. I want to win trophies and I am very sad that we can't do that this year. "But on the other hand I feel we have done a lot for the Premier League this year. We want to continue the way we play but play better the way we play and then the trophies will come. "It was a very thin margin between winning and losing this season. I think we have to go beyond the fact that the winner is always praised maybe beyond reason and the guy who doesn't win, or team that doesn't win, is slaughtered beyond reason. "Football is more than that.
