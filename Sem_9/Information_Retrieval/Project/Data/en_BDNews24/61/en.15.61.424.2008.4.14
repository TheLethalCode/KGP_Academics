<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 13 (bdnews24.com)  Pakistan Sunday sealed the five-ODI series 3-0 with two matches to go when the hosts handed a 23-run defeat to visitors Bangladesh in the crucial third match at Gaddafi Stadium Lahore. Bangladesh ended up at 285 for seven in the thrilling chase after Pakistan racked up 308 for eight in 50 overs. Bangladesh were well in the hunt for an upset until both Tamim Iqbal and Mohammad Ashraful were run out to erase Bangladesh's hope to keep the series alive. Tamim, who looked aggressive from the beginning, was run out for 63 off 69 balls following his lethargic running for a third run as Pakistani keeper Kamran Akmal did not mistake to break the stumps getting a direct throw from Fawad Alam at backward point. While Ashraful (16) started running to push Shahid Afridi to the off-side, but Shakib Al Hasan sent him back, but by then Akmal picked the bails capitalising on a high throw again from Fawad. Before Ashraful's departure, a well-set Aftab Ahmed played a needless reverse shot off a Shoaib Malik delivery to give Akam an easy catch behind the wicket, leaving the side at 125 for three in 22.2 overs. Mahmudullah (24) and Farhad Reza (13) were got out for big hits. Despite the exit of big hitters, it appeared Shakib kept Bangladesh in the match until the left-handed batsman was bowled for a 73-ball 75 while playing Afridi for a paddle scoop, leaving the side at 250 for seven in 46 balls. Bangladesh saw 19 runs come in the 47th over with another 40 runs needing in the last 18 balls, but unbeaten batsmen Dhiman Ghosh (18) and Mashrafee Bin Mortaza (15) were able to add only 16 runs in the last three overs. Earlier, openers Kamran Akmal and Salman Butt each struck century to help Pakistan put up a challenging total on the board. They laid a solid foundation for the hosts contributing 151 for the opening stand after skipper Malik chose to bat first on a good batting track, which saw Bangladesh go 152-run down in the series opener. Off-spinner Mahmudullah, coming to bowl at number six, drew first blood for the visitors bowling Akaml out in the 24th over. Akmal who survived from a run-out scare on 19 runs finally blazed an 81-ball 100 while Butt struck 132 to take Pakistan beyond the 300-mark against Bangladesh for the sixth time. The Pakistani wicketkeeper smashed 16 fours and one six on way to his fourth century while Butt clubbed 15 boundaries facing 127 balls on way to his fifth century. Bangladesh pace duo Mashrafee and Shahadat Hossain in the beginning bowled tightly to clutch the hosts grip with scoreboard reading 17 for no loss in 7 overs, but they failed to keep the momentum with Akmal coming out from his shell to hit Shahadat for three successive fours in the 8th over. Ashraful brought in medium pacer Farhad and spinner Abdur Razzak in place of Shahadat and Mashrafee, but it went in vain in the face of some aggressive shots from Akmal. However, Riad broke the stand triggering a mini collapse in the middle, and Pakistan slipped to 187 for four from 151 for one with left-arm spinner Shakib Al Hasan removing Mohammad Yousuf (2) However, Mahmudullah broke the stand triggering a mini collapse in the middle, and Pakistan slipped to 187 for four from 151 for one with left-arm spinner Shakib Al Hasan removing Mohammad Yousuf (2) and Shahid Afridi (13), and Mashrafee running out Bazid Khan (2). But, Bangladesh failed to capitalise on the slump, and Butt pairing with skipper Malik added another 80 runs for the sixth wicket before Malik (33) was trapped in front by Farhad, leaving the side at 267 for five 5 in 44.5 overs. Afterwards, Shahadat removed Misbah-ul-Haq (10) in the 48th over while Mahrafee finally had Butt caught behind by keeper Dhiman and dismissed Sohail (1) in his last over to return two for 47, most successful Bangladesh bowler. Shakib also grabbed two wickets giving away 50 runs in his 10-over spell. bdn
