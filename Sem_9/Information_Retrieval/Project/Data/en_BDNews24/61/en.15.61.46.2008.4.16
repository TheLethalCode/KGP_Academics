 Dhaka, April 16 (bdnew24.com)Bangladeshi novelist Hasan Azizul Haque has been awarded the Ananda Award, by Kolkata-based Ananda Publishers, for his contribution to literature. He won the award especially for his novel "Agunpakhi". Giving his reaction on receiving the award, Hasan Azizul told bdnews24.com: "Writing is for spreading ideas among people. If winning an award helps the spread of idea, then good." "However, even after getting an award a writer has to work alone." On the significance of the Ananda Award, the former professor of philosophy said: "The greater perspective of Bangla literature in both Banglas is being evaluated." Since 1961, a total of 21 people have received the Bangla literature award, including Bangladeshi writers Syed Muztaba Ali, Akhteruzzaman Ilyas and Taslima Nasreen. Prominent Ananda Award winners also include Sukumar Sen, Shirshendu Mukherjee, Sanjeeb Chhatterjee, Samoresh Majumder, Sunil Ganguly, Budhadev Guha, Ananda Shankar Roy, Bani Basu and Dritikanta Lahiri Chowdhury.

Hasan Azizul has received a number of national literature awards including the Bangla Academy literature award. His notable works include Samudrer Swapna, Shiter Aranya, Ma Meyer Sangsar, Naamhim Gotrahin, Atmaja O Ekti Korobi Gachh, Jibon Ghoshe Agun, Patale Haspatale and Brittayan.
