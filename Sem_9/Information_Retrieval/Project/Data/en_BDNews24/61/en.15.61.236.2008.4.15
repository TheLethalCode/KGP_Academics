<TEXT>
 LONDON, April 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two men tried to blackmail a member of the British royal family with an audio recording featuring claims he had performed a gay sex act on an employee, a court was told on Tuesday. Ian Strachan, 31, and Sean McGuigan, 41, tried to blackmail the royal, who cannot be identified, for 50,000 pounds ($98,390) after failing to sell the story to a number of national newspapers, prosecutors said. Both deny making an unwarranted demand with menaces. The recordings at the centre of the claims contained material from a man employed in the royal household which, if ever published, would have the potential to "cause embarrassment and hurt to his employer", said prosecutor Mark Ellison. The recordings also contained "scandalous and disparaging remarks" about other royals, the jury at the Old Bailey was told.

"He was also shown recounting stories and alleged experiences, making allegations of impropriety as to how his employer conducted aspects of his business," Ellison said. The man was heard giving forthright opinions "on a wide range of other members of the royal family -- which included a number of scandalous and disparaging remarks"," said the prosecutor. Prosecutors said that between March and July 2007, Strachan approached several newspapers -- The News of the World, The Sun, the Sunday Express, Mail on Sunday -- and publicist Max Clifford to try and sell the material, asking for a "substantial sum". By July 2007, he had not managed to sell the story, the court heard. Strachan and McGuigan then allegedly turned their attention from the media to the royal -- witness A. The case continu
