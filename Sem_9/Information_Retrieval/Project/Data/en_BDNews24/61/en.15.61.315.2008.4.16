 Savar, April 16 (bdnews24.com) At least five students were injured in clashes between two groups of Bangladesh Chhatra League students at Jahangirnagar University's Al-Beruni Hall, students and university officials said. The two rival groups vandalised at least 20 rooms including the house tutors' room and a guest room. AB Hall provost Asit Baran Pal and house tutors arrived on the scene following reports of the violence. The provost told bdnews24.com: "An emergency meeting has been called to investigate the incident." Additional police have been deployed at all the university halls including Al-Beruni Hall, he added. The injured, taken to Enam Medical College Hospital, were identified as English student Fahad, anthropology students Raisul and Rasel, mathematics student Aman and economics student Regan. The dispute began over hall placements. One group of BCL students claimed they had been ousted from AB Hall a week earlier by a rival BCL group, and were obstructed as they tried to enter the hall Tuesday night. bdnews24
