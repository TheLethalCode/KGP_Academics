 Dhaka, April 15 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court has reset the hearing on former prime minister Sheikh Hasina for Thursday in the barge-mounted power plant case. Judge Md Firoz Alam heard an appeal for a fourth day Tuesday, which sought to exempt the Awami League president from the charges in the case. The court deferred the hearing after Hasina complained of ear pain to the judge. Hasina was taken to court around 9:45am from the special jail sited in the Sangsad Bhaban complex. Hasina repeated that she might not get justice in the case. "I heard that the judiciary had been separated from the executive. It is only on paper. If you can't do justice and you are under pressure, deliver the verdict against me," Hasina told the judge. Barrister Toufique Newaj took part in the hearing on behalf of Hasina. SM Sabbir, deputy director of the Anticorruption Commission, filed the case against Hasina with Tejgaon Police Station in September last year on charges of taking bribe in return for approval to the installation of three barge-mounted power plants during her term as prime minister. Seven others were accused in the case. bdnew
