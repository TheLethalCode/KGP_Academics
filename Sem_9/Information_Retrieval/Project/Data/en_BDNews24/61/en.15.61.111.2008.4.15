 MADRID, April 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Liverpool striker Fernando Torres said on Monday that Spain's Primera Liga was stronger than the Premier League despite the presence of three English teams in the Champions League semi-finals. "In England the top four are better than the ones in Spain, above all when it comes to consistency," the Spain international told Radio Marca. "Apart from that, the rest of the teams in the Primera Liga are stronger as they have more quality." The former Atletico Madrid forward, who netted his 30th goal of the season in Liverpool's 3-1 victory over Blackburn Rovers on Sunday, said he was enjoying the patience afforded by English supporters. "The fans aren't on top of you all the time here, they give you time, they get behind you but don't suffocate you. I'm very happy here," he said. Torres added that he would like to meet Barcelona in the Champions League final in Moscow, if his side can get past Chelsea in the semis later this month. "The people here would prefer to face Manchester United, but I think it would be great to take on Barcelona," he said. The Merseysiders knocked out Arsenal 5-3 on aggregate in the quarter-finals last week to make the final four for the third time in four years. They host Chelsea in the semi-final first leg on April 22 with the return leg at Stamford Bridge on April 30. United take Barcelona, the only non-Premier League side, Barca, in the second semi-final
