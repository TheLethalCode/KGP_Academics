 TEHRAN, April 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said on Thursday "satanic" foreign forces had failed in their bid to dominate the Middle East's energy resources and did not dare threaten Iran.

Iran has regularly demanded the United States and its Western allies withdraw from Iraq and the region, as well as calling for a security pact with nearby Gulf Arab states. Gulf Arab states, which are mostly Sunni Muslim, have yet to take up the offer and have long been wary of Shi'ite Muslim Iran's intentions in the area.
