<TITLE> Host of issues still in way of new WTO push: India </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, April 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Trade negotiators must clear away a host of disputed technical issues before an expected meeting of ministers in a month's time to push for a long-delayed global trade deal, an Indian trade official said. Indian Commerce Secretary Gopal K. Pillai confirmed on Thursday that ministers from World Trade Organisation countries were likely to meet in Geneva in the week of May 19 to seek an elusive breakthrough in the talks to open up world trade. Pillai told Reuters there had been positive developments in the talks but in agriculture the number of technical issues still outstanding, or in "square brackets", had to be reduced before the ministers could address large political questions. "If you really want to call a ministerial, which they are planning for May 19 and of course which India will be attending if there is such a meeting, the number of square brackets needs to be reduced substantially," he said in an interview. Leaving 20 or 25 such issues to be resolved by ministers would be feasible but if "you have 100, then forget it", he said. "What is essential is that the ministers must get into what is known as the political (issues). You can't have technical issues, leaving it for the ministers to decide." The negotiations, known as the Doha round, were launched in 2001 in a bid to boost the world economy and help developing nations export more. Since then, they have missed several deadlines but intensive talks in recent months suggest a deal may be within reach. OPTIMISTIC MOOD Earlier in April, the European Union, the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia and Brazil reached an agreement amongst themselves on how to deal with farm products that rich countries consider sensitive, potentially clearing away one big sticking point although some differences on the small print remain. "I think the mood is generally optimistic," Pillai said. "I think with the global crisis, global slowdown etcetera, people feel that this is an opportunity which you have and which should not be lost sight of, if you get a good deal." But he questioned whether a deal could be done soon, given that U.S. presidential elections take place in November. The Democratic-run House of Representatives voted last week to delay action indefinitely on a free trade agreement with Colombia, leading President George W. Bush to declare it dead. "I don't think that would be a stumbling block but I think that would be at the back of the mind of most developing country delegates," Pillai said. "Does the U.S. have anything to give? Because there is something that they will have to give to have a deal." India and other developing countries have pressed the United States to make big cuts to the subsidies it pays to its farmers. But Washington says it wants countries such as India to bring down barriers to imports of farm products and other goods. As well as farming, the Doha negotiations also include talks on opening up trade in industrial goods and services. Pillai said there was not much more India could give in the form of tariff cuts and in some ways it was a very open economy. "When I am exporting $150 billion, I am importing $230 billion, how much more open do you want me to be?"
