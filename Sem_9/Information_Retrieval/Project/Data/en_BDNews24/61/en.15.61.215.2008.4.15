 LONDON, April 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - ITV is to drop an episode of its latest flagship drama "Pushing Daisies" because it overlaps with coverage of Euro 2008, it said on Tuesday. The American hit show, which features former "Brookside" star Anna Friel, has been one of the year's most talked-about programmes. The opening episode on ITV1 last Saturday pulled in 5.7 million viewers. The modern day fairytale is about a man who brings people back from the dead, including his first love. But despite its success, ITV has decided to show only eight of the nine episodes to make way for the football tournament. It blamed a strike by US scriptwriters for a heavy programme schedule. Episode two, which shows Ned coming to terms with his power, will be omitted, with the possibility it may be shown at a later date. "Episode two is the only one we can take out at this stage without disrupting the flow of the series but it's a great `stand alone' show, and one we will broadcast later this year," an ITV spokesman said. "Due to the US writers' strike, delivery of many acquisitions has been affected. "Rather than receiving a full series of many of this year's shows we've had a range of different options -- such as 13 parts so far for "Gossip Girl" and nine parts for "Pushing Daisies". "This has an impact on scheduling -- particularly in the more competitive slots -- as we typically receive dramas in parts of six or eight. "Unfortunately given the high profile nature of the 9 p m Saturday slot, we only have eight windows at the moment and have therefore made the decision to show the second episode at a future point." ITV and the BBC will share coverage of the Euro 2008 championships, being held in Austria and Switzerland, with the first game being shown on June
