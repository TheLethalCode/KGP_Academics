<TITLE> Guinea bans food, oil exports to curb high prices </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Conarky, April 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Guinea has banned the export of all types of foodstuffs, oil and timber in an effort to combat a sharp spike in prices of staple goods, state television announced late on Tuesday. "The international market can no longer guarantee the stability of prices in the short-term on national markets," said the statement. "The National Defence Council has decided to forbid the export and re-export of agricultural, forestry, livestock, fishing and oil products." A national strike a year ago triggered by high inflation under veteran President Lansana Conte's authoritarian government left more than 130 people dead, most of them civilians shot by security forces, according to civil rights groups. After dropping to around 12 percent at the end of last year, inflation has risen sharply in recent months. A sack of rice which cost 85,000 CFA francs in December is now worth 200,000 CFA francs in the coastal capital Conakry, residents say. High international food prices have hit hard in impoverished West Africa, sparking riots from Senegal to Ivory Coast and prompting many government to remove import duties and taxes on basic foodstuffs. More than 100 people died in protests triggered by rising prices in Cameroon in February, according to rights campaigners.
