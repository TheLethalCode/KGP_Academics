 LAHORE, April 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan paceman Mohammad Asif has been recalled for the final two matches of the one-day series against Bangladesh after spending more than six months out of international action through injury. The spearhead bowler has not played for Pakistan since last October after picking up an elbow injury which required surgery in Australia, but made a comeback in a domestic one-day match last week. "I have been working hard on rehabilitation process to make a comeback and after playing in the one-day game last week, I felt comfortable and bowled to a nice rhythm," Asif told Reuters on Monday. The paceman, who has taken 51 test wickets in a short career curtailed by fitness problems, said working under the supervision of Pakistan's Australian coach Geoff Lawson and trainer David Dwyer had helped improve his fitness. "I think this is the best time to ease back into top level cricket. The pressure is less because we have won the series," he added. Pakistan enjoy an unassailable 3-0 lead in the five-match series with the fourth game in Multan on Wednesday. Weighing up the side's bowling options for the future, the selectors included two other young pace bowlers, Kamran Hussain and Wahab Riaz, in their squad after both made their debuts against Zimbabwe earlier this year. "We have had many fitness issues with our pace bowlers in recent years," captain Shoaib Malik said. "The series against Zimbabwe and Bangladesh have allowed us to ease some promising new bowlers into international cricket. "We need to have enough bowlers to overcome fitness issues and have a rotation policy when possible.
