<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 16 (bdnews24.com) -- Foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury said Wednesday Bangladesh would press for a global food security compact at next week's UNCTAD conference in Ghana. "The entire global community shares a common responsibility," said Iftekhar, sharing his views on the upcoming United Nations Conference on Trade and Development with the media ihis office. "In today's world, when one person is hungry, the pangs should be shared by all," said the adviser. The United Nations should initiate informational cooperation to expand food availability through a global food security compact, Iftekhar said. A foreign ministry statement said the adviser felt that recent worldwide shortages in grain supplies is a significant enough issue for the United Nations to focus on as a priority. The adviser said new green revolutions should be inspired through more research and development on food as well as the production and distribution of high-yielding seed varieties. Expanding acreage in agriculture should constitute elements of this thrust-programme, he said. "Bangladesh will press for this, along with a package of other ideas, as chairman of the Group of Least Developed Countries  to mainstream them in the global economy, at UNCTAD XII in Accra," the statement said. UNCTAD takes place every four years, with the upcoming conference being held in Accra, the capital of Ghana, from April 20-25. On April 19, Iftekhar will chair a ministerial conference of least developed countries to finalise the LDC position in the conference. He said: "Bangladesh will field a strong delegation to represent the LDCs and Bangladesh effectively at Accra." The theme of the conference will be "Addressing the opportunities and challenges of globalisations for development". The adviser said it would be a timely conference as developing countries are struggling to achieve the millennium development goals by 2015. "The least developed countries are the most vulnerable, as they are hit hardest by food shortages, lower prices for their exportable commodities and tariff and non-tariff market restrictions," Iftekhar said. The adviser underscored the importance of initiatives like 'Aid for trade,' and greater policy-space and flexibility within the framework of a developmental state. He said "access to knowledge, and technology transfer as also important elements". Under the enhanced integrated framework, Bangladesh could be a good candidate for infra-structural projects such as deep-sea ports, Dhaka-Chittagong Highway and the development of Mongla Port, he said. bd
