 PORT OF SPAIN (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - West Indies recovered from a shaky start to defeat Sri Lanka by seven wickets in the rain-affected second one-day international on Saturday and claim an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series. Set a target of 125 to win in 25 overs after rain halted Sri Lanka's innings at 112 for five, the hosts were in trouble at 18 for three before Shivnarine Chanderpaul (52 not out) and Marlon Samuels (54 not out) saw them home. Sri Lanka's early breakthrough came courtesy of the lively seam bowling of Nuwan Kulasekara, who dismissed openers Dwayne Bravo and Chris Gayle cheaply before taking the precious wicket of the in-form Ramnaresh Sarwan. But then Chanderpaul, who won the first game on Thursday with a six off the last ball, and Samuel produced a partnership of 107 in 14.4 overs -- at an impressive 7.29 runs an over -- to secure victory with 27 balls remaining. Samuels, who had been under pressure after failing throughout the two tests and Thursday's opening one-day game, hit three fours and three sixes in an impressive knock, to dispel any notions of him being dropped. "I've been saying all along that in the nets Marlon has looked in great form and within himself he has been relaxed and confident about his ability," said West Indies coach John Dyson. "I thought that was a superb innings he played today, under some pressure because of all the talk that has been going on and also because we lost a couple of wickets with the new ball -- he played the match perfectly. "It showed he has great skill. We all love to watch him when he is in that kind of form and his experience paid off and allowed him to keep a cool head," added the Australian. Sri Lanka's effort was cut short by the rain but just at the moment when the hosts were getting into the middle order. The opening pair put on 38 before Mahela Udawatte (14) took a big swing at Jerome Taylor and skied a catch to Sewnarine Chattergoon. Upul Tharanga made a smart 40 before he went with the score at 78 for two -- the Sri Lanka opener slashing out to Taylor at deep point off Dwayne Bravo. After a break for rain, West Indies grabbed three quick wickets in damp and overcast conditions before the heavens opened. Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara (28) will be furious with himself after driving a slow full-toss from Gayle straight to Ramnaresh Sarwan at square leg. A slower ball from Darren Sammy dismissed Kaushalya Weeraratne (15) who, already committed to the drive, lofted the ball to Bravo at backward point. Then Gayle struck again, a full-length delivery bowling Chamara Silva (2) who got tangled up as he came down the track. The three-match series ends on Tuesday in St Luci
