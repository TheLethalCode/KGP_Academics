<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 16 (bdnews24.com)Jamaat-e-Islami in a statement issued Wednesday claimed that the caretaker administration has no authority to make any decision on national policies including the national women development policy. In the statement, Motiur Rahman Nizami, chief of Jamaat-e-Islami, called upon the interim government to enter into discussions over problems they felt remained with the policy. "By adding sections to the women development policy, which go against the holy Quran and the Sunnah, the government has brought religious leaders and religious-minded people into conflict with women," the statement said. The controversial Jamaat leader claimed solidarity on the issue with other religious groups of the country and demanded the four-member advisory committee previously tasked with reviewing the policy be reformed. "The committee must be reformed and the national women development policy amended in light of the opinions of religious leaders," said Nizami. bdnew
