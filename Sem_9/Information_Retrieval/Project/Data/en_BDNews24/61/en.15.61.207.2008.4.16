<TITLE> Winning Cup not good enough for Valencia says president </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MADRID, April 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Winning the King's Cup will not make up for a "disastrous season", Valencia president Agustin Morera said on Tuesday. The six-times winners meet Getafe in the final at the Vicente Calderon on Wednesday with Spanish media reporting that their coach Ronald Koeman's days in the dugout are numbered. "It isn't possible to make amends for Valencia's season. We have an obligation to win the cup to give the fans something to cheer about after the disastrous season we've had," Morera told Radio Marca. "It is to be expected (the fans are unhappy). I think it is Valencia's worst campaign at home that I can remember and I understand them." Valencia have suffered nine defeats at the Mestalla and have the joint worst home record in the league along with bottom club Levante, taking just 15 points from 16 games. After Saturday's 2-1 reverse at home to Racing Santander supporters once again called for Koeman to go. The former Netherlands international replaced Quique Sanchez Flores at the beginning of November but was unable to prevent the title hopefuls from going out of the Champions League and sliding down the Primera Liga. His record of four wins from 21 league games, has left them 15th in the standings, five points above the relegation places. A cup run, in which they saw off the likes of Atletico Madrid and Barcelona to make the final, may have come too late to rescue Koeman. "The future is decided. We have been working on this for some time. Decisions have been taken that will not be affected by what happens in the cup final," Morera said. When asked about Koeman's future, Morera added: "He has a contract (until 2010) and at Valencia we respect contracts. He is the coach at present and I am only interested in the cup game, which we have to win. "The responsibility for this lies with the coach, the players and myself. I don't like the way the team plays but I am not the one at pitchside and it isn't my decision.
