 Nairobi, April 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police shot dead two people when Kenya's dreaded Mungiki gang took to the streets again on Tuesday, presenting a brazen challenge to Kenya's new coalition government on only its second day in office. A Reuters Television journalist saw two people who police had shot dead in Nairobi's Industrial Area, where witnesses said Mungiki members were stoning cars. The gang, drawn from the majority Kikuyu tribe, has said it is protesting against the beheading of its jailed leader's wife last week, which it blamed on police. Police deny that. Mungiki is Kenya's version of the mafia and has provided muscle-for-hire to politicians in the past. It provoked a bloody police crackdown that led to more than 100 deaths last year, after the group killed and beheaded scores of people. There was a heavy police presence across the Kenyan capital, a regular sight since a disputed Dec. 27 election spilled into ethnic violence.
