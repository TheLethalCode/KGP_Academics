 Faruk Iqbal Chittagong Bureau chief bdnews24.com Chittagong, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com)Saif Power Tech's unusually low quote of Tk 155 per container handling charge at Chittagong Container Terminal has raised eyebrows as bidding in the latest CCT tender ended this week. The firm had charged Tk 1200 per container during the previous caretaker government's tenure and, kept on under an 'interim deal' after its contract expired last year, is currently taking Tk 505 per container. Other bidders have questioned how the same company's quotation dipped to Tk 155 from Tk 1200 in the new tender for the contract. Port operators and other firms participating in the tender have termed the bid "suspicious", "amazing" and "mysterious". They say it indicates that the port has been "a den of looting and plundering" in recent years and the company should be "brought to justice" for overpricing in the past. Managing director of Saif Power Tech, Ruhul Amin Tarafdar, has rejected the suspicions and allegations, telling bdnews24.com: "There is nothing mysterious here. It is merely a business strategy." Asked to comment, Chittagong port chairman Commodore Riaz U Ahmed said "it would not be fair to make any remark right now" on Saif Power Tech's bid. Ahmed told bdnews24.com that a final decision would be made on receiving the report of the tender committee, which will assess the bids in line with PPR guidelines. Saif Power Tech was appointed to handle containers at CCT in June 2006. After the contract expired in 2008, two tenders were floated that year to appoint a new handler. Birth operator Everest Enterprise was the lowest bidder in the first tender in November 2008, quoting Tk 453 handling charge per container. However, the then shipping adviser to the caretaker government, MA Matin, cancelled the tender, saying "conditions were not met" and floated a new one. Esack Brothers Ltd quoted the lowest price, Tk 340 per container, in the second tender in December. The ministry approved a work order after accepting Esack's bid and the Chittagong Port Authority signed an agreement with the firm on Feb 2 this year. But on Oct 8, eight months after the deal signing, it cancelled Esack's contract following recommendations of the parliamentary standing committee on shipping. The standing committee recommended cancellation of the contract and floating of a new tender after allegations were raised that former shipping adviser MA Matin had helped the firm secure the tender through irregularities. The committee found that Matin had pushed the contract with Esack Brothers through "within 24 hours" on the eve of his departure. The standing committee also said Esack Bros does not possess required experience to handle the work order. Esack on Oct 12 demanded Tk 25 crore in damages from port authorities for the cancelled contract. In a letter, it also threatened the CPA with legal action if the compensation was not paid "within 15 days". Everest Enterprise, meanwhile, sued for compensation on Sep 1 for cancellation of the original tender. The company is seeking Tk 25 crore in damages from Matin and ex-shipping secretary Sheikh Motahar Hossain. In a third bidding round, on Nov 5 this year, current CCT operator Saif Power Tech quoted the lowest price for the three-year contract of Tk 13.95 crore, or Tk 155 per container. Moinul Haque Chowdhury, managing director of MH Chowdhury, a co-bidder, estimates container handling at CCT would cost at Tk 85 to Tk 90 lakh (excluding 15 percent VAT) per month in workers' wages alone. "It is a mystery how Saif Power Tech could quote Tk 155 per container," he said. "How can Saif Power Tech work at so low price while the quotation of Tk 26 crore by Esack Brothers was cancelled," he wanted to know. Fazle Akram Chowdhury, convener of the Berth Operators Association and proprietor of Fazle and Sons, another of the bidders termed Saif's quote "amazing". "There must be something behind this; Saif Power comes under suspicion with such a bid," he said. A high official of the port, declining to be named, told bdnews24.com that the bid should be competitive and consistent with the work order. "It needs pondering why Saif Power Tech has quoted so cheap price," he said. He also said it might well be that the company had earned such high profits with its previous contract that they could now afford to offer a "subsidy". "Or it might be that they do not want let in any new company and so they are not thinking about profit," he said. Saif Power Tech's MD Ruhul Amin Tarafdar told bdnews24.com, however, "From our three year experience we have seen that it is possible to cut workforce to one third." "On top of that we will not need to invest in new infrastructure," he said. "And Tk 300 per container will come from agents," Tarafdar added. A fee per container, comprising container binding and unbinding and tally charges, has always been in place, has always been payable by shipping agents but in the past the could never be realised. The agents simply did not pay up. Tarafdar said Saif Power Tech, in order to bring its own costs down, would strictly enforce the charges payable by agents from now. bdn
