<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com)  About 2,500 pharmacies of the country's biggest wholesale market for drugs, in Mitford, Old Dhaka, kept their shutters closed Saturday in protest against the arrest of three sellers in Chittagong earlier in the week. Drug wholesalers in Chittagong's Hajari Lane were also on strike. The wholesalers announced the half-day strike from 9am to 2pm following a RAB drive that resulted in arrests of three drug sellers, with alleged contraband drugs, in Chittagong's Hajari Lane area on Thursday. Some 400 wholesalers in Chittagong had closed their doors that day protesting the drive and the arrests as "harassment". Nazimul Islam Mukul, owner of a pharmacy of Bhandari Market in Mitford, Old Dhaka, speaking to bdnews24.com on Saturday, alleged: "RAB carried out a looting in Hajari Lane that day in the name of a drive." He said the law enforcers also reportedly seized legal medicines from a Chittagong pharmacy in Thursday's drive. Bangladesh Chemist and Drug Association deputy general secretary Monir Hossain voiced his solidarity with the strike. He told bdnews24.com: "The government has not given us any proper directive about which drug is legal and which is illegal." "The pharmacists are facing harassment for no reason," he said. He urged the government to make an official list of 'legal' and 'illegal' drugs and provide it to the pharmacists. RAB-7's Major Azad, who led the drive on Thursday, has said they seized only contraband drugs from Chittagong's Popular Pharmacy. bdnews
