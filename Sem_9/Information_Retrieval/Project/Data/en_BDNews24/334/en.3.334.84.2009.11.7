 Dhaka, Nov 07 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League observed Freedom Fighter Killing Day on Saturday, while main opposition party BNP marked the same as National Revolution and Solidarity Day. Yet a third political party, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal, observes Nov 7 as People-Sepoys Uprising Day. The series of events that took place in the first week of November 1975, including an uprising by people and soldiers, ended with the then army chief Maj Gen Ziaur Rahman, also founder of BNP, at the helm of state power. Khaled Mosharaf, one of the sector commanders of the liberation war, led a revolt of the army on Nov 3 1975, in a bid to overthrow the killers of the Bangabandhu. The then army chief Ziaur Rahman was detained. Col Abu Taher, who was linked with JSD, released Ziaur Rahman in a counter revolt on Nov 7. Many army officers, including Maj Khaled Mosharraf, were killed that day. The subsequent military government led by Ziaur Rahman executed Col Taher on July 21, 1976. Taher termed Zia a 'traitor' during his trial under military tribunal. The Nov 3 uprising was sparked by the Jail Killings of four national leaders, Syed Nazrul Islam, Tajuddin Ahmed, M Monsur Ali and AHM Quamruzzaman, in Dhaka Central Jail. The four leaders, who had been closest to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, had been detained following Mujib's assassination along with family members on Aug 15 1975. Political divide Saturday saw political parties observe Nov 7 with widely differing sentiments and programmes. Supporters of ruling Awami League formed a human chain in front of the ruling party's central office. State minister for law Kamrul Islam, addressing the crowd, said: "BNP is keeping people in a fog by observing November 7 as 'National Revolution and Solidarity Day'." Islam said Ziaur Rahman during his reign had "killed hundreds of military officers and sepoys who had been freedom fighters". "Journalists, columnists and military officers must reveal what really happened between Nov 3 and Nov 7 to wipe out any confusion." Meanwhile, BNP chief Khaleda Zia, her party leaders and crowds of supporters offered tribute at the grave of late president Ziaur Rahman. BNP, during their time in power, had declared the day a public holiday. The party's secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain told reporters at the site, "This government is taking up other activities to divert from the significance of the day. But the people never approved of such steps, they will never do so." bdnews2
