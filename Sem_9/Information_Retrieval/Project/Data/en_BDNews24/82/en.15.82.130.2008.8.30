 MADRID, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news from the Primera Liga ahead of this weekend's matches: Argentina forward Lionel Messi is set to return to action for Barcelona on Sunday when they travel to face second division champions Numancia in Pep Guardiola's league debut at the helm. Messi was rested for Barca's Champions League third qualifying round, second leg away to Wisla Krakow during the week, which they came through 4-1 on aggregate, after helping Argentina to win gold at the Beijing Olympics,. All eyes will be on Bernd Schuster's team sheet to see whether he will include Robinho for Sunday's trip to face Deportivo Coruna. The Brazil forward's on-off move to Chelsea has seen him watching Real's last two games from the sidelines. New signing Rafael van der Vaart is suspended. Deportivo boosted their confidence on Thursday with a 2-0 victory away to Hajduk Split that put them in the first round of the UEFA Cup. Riki and Joan Verdu scored for the Galicians. "We deserved to go through and we are delighted, especially as we had rested some players for the Real game," coach Miguel Angel Lotina said. Sevilla's Mali striker Frederic Kanoute has been impressed with the side during pre-season and has said they are in good shape for their opener away to Racing Santander on Sunday. "The squad is stronger than last year (when they finished fifth). We aren't favourites for the league but we could certainly spring a surprise," he said. Real Betis have problems for the visit of regional rivals Recreativo Huelva on Sunday with forwards Rafael Sobis, Edu and Jose Mari all injured. Winger Mark Gonzalez is struggling with a muscle strain. King's Cup finalists Getafe will be without experienced captain David Belenguer for the trip to face newly-promoted Sporting Gijon on Sunday. The centre back has damaged a shoulder. Real Mallorca's Guinea striker Alhassane Keita will miss Saturday's match at Valencia with a muscle injury, but fellow new arrival Aritz Aduriz from Athletic Bilbao could make his debut. Valencia are still licking their wounds from last weekend's 4-1 defeat to nine-man Real Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup second leg
