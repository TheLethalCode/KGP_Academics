 DHARAMSALA, India, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thousands of Tibetans in India fasted and prayed for peace in Tibet on Saturday and their leader, the Dalai Lama, participated from his hospital bed in Mumbai. The 73-year old exiled Tibetan spiritual leader was being treated for abdominal pains. Doctors said there was no cause for concern and more tests were being done, a Dalai Lama aide said. At least four thousand people, mostly Tibetan monks, nuns and school children gathered in a temple near the Dalai Lama's residence in Dharamsala, home to the Tibetan government-in-exile, to participate in the 12-hour fast. "He (the Dalai Lama) was feeling good yesterday," said Chhime Chhoekyapa, a senior aide to the Dalai Lama. "He is feeling better today, he started fasting from this morning 7 a.m. and he will continue till evening. The doctors say that there is nothing to worry (about)." The Dalai Lama had cancelled two foreign trips this week citing fatigue and was admitted into hospital on Thursday. "It will be decided after Monday whether he stays in the hospital or he moves to a hotel or he moves to Dharamsala," said Chhoekyapa. During the fast, which was organised by the Tibetan Solidarity Committee, a statement was issued by the Tibetan government-in-exile calling on Tibetans to "put concerted non-violent efforts to bring a natural end to the torture and persecution in Tibet". The Nobel Peace Prize winner returned to Dharamsala, the north Indian town where he lives, on Sunday after a two-week visit to France where he mainly gave lectures on Buddhism, but also criticised Chinese policies in Tibet. China's crackdown on protests in Tibet in March drew widespread condemnation from the international community. China accused the Dalai Lama and his allies of orchestrating the protests and of trying to derail the Beijing Olympic Games, but he denied the allegations, saying he supported the Olympics and the Chinese people deserved to host them. "This is a very solemn moment for all the Tibetans," said Tenzin Tsundue, a Tibetan poet and activist. "This is a time to reflect on how we did this year for freedom and a moment to pause and think for ourselves in these trying times of our history."
