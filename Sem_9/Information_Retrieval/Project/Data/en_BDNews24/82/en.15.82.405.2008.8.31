<TITLE> Saudi, most Gulf Arabs, to start Ramadan on Monday </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dubai, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam, will start the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan on Monday along with most other Gulf states, regional state media reported on Saturday. Senior religious councils in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates said the moon's crescent was not sighted after nightfall on Saturday, and so Sunday would be the last day of the month preceding Ramadan. Muslims scan the sky at night in search of the new moon to proclaim the start of Ramadan, the holiest month for the world's more than one billion Muslims, during which observant believers fast from dawn to dusk. Businesses and offices reduce opening hours during the day and often re-open in the evenings.
