 WANA, Pakistan, Wed Sep 3, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Suspected US commandos from Afghanistan killed 20 people, including women and children, in a pre-dawn raid inside Pakistan, officials said, an attack branded as an assault on the nation's sovereignty.

The village is across the border from Bermal, a village near a US base at Shikin in Afghanistan's Paktika province. "Troops came in helicopters and carried out action in three houses," said Angor Adda village shopkeeper Gul Nawaz. Other residents said the foreign troops detained some people and took them away. US-operated drone aircraft have launched attacks in Pakistani border regions several times this year, killing dozens of militants, but US ground troops had not been known to cross into Pakistan to fight militants.
