 Dhaka, Sept 1 (bdnews24.com) - BNP secretary general Khandker Delwar Hossain accused the government of biased action on Monday, saying it was filing appeals against the bail orders "of those it did not like". Delwar was addressing a discussion on 'Three decades of BNP: Shaheed Zia and Khaleda Zia' at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh (IEB) auditorium in the city, marking the 30th founding anniversary of the party. Expressing concern at the government's delay in sending Tarique Rahman abroad for better treatment, Delwar said: "We want an end to the government's biased behaviour." He said that BNP would not accept any change of power through any means except a fair election, participated in by all parties. He urged the government to arrange the parliament election quickly and urged party leaders and workers to become stronger organisationally. Delwar also expressed indignation over government "failure" to control price of essentials in the month of Ramadan. General secretary of BNP ally Jamaat-e-Islami, Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojahid also speaking on the occasion, said: "Our movement will continue till the release of Khaleda Zia. The government will be compelled to free her." Aiming at Awami League, the Jamaat leader said: "We do not want to play in an empty field during the next election. The four-party alliance will defeat you in election. Our victory is very near." Former information minister and BNP standing committee member M Shamsul Islam lauded the leadership of Khaleda: "She has turned the party founded by Shaheed Zia into a grand one."
