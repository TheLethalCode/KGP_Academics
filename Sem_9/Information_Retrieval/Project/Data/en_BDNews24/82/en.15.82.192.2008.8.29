<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com)  BNP vice president MK Anwar on Friday said party chief Khaleda Zia would be freed through legal process, not compromise. "Khaleda Zia will not buy freedom through any understanding or compromise with the government. She will come out free soon through legal process," he said after a meeting at the NAM flat home of secretary general Khandker Delwar Hossain. He said after the bail papers reached the jail authorities Tarique Rahman will walk out of prison in a day or two. Anwar said if they were released, the BNP-led four-party alliance would participate in the dialogue with the Election Commission and general elections. However, he added, it was the responsibility of the government to create the environment, for which the state of emergency should be lifted "BNP wants to participate in the election. But the national election would have to be held first. The responsibility of holding upazila election does not fall on this government." He, however, said he had doubts about the parliamentary elections slated for December. BNP organising secretary Mohammad Shahjahan told bdnews24.com, "The meeting discussed making the party stronger at the grassroots in Chittagong division. During the Ramadan we'll work on increasing organisational strengths." bdne
