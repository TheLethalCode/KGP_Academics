 Dhaka, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com)  Wholesale and retail traders in the city were caught ducking blame on Tuesday for a fresh hike in prices of essential commodities at the start of Ramadan. They traded accusations when a delegation of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry led by president Annisul Huq had been out on a spot visit to monitor prices on the first day of Ramadan. "The retailers are selling goods at almost twice the price they are buying from us. They are mainly responsible for the price rise," Abdul Mannan, general secretary of Karwan Bazar Wholesale Traders Association, told the delegation. He also said the retailers did not take money receipt while buying commodities, an accusation the retailers countered, saying it was the wholesalers who would not give receipt. Abdul Khaleque, president of New Market Banolata Kitchen Market Traders Association, said, "We are not given any receipt from Karwan Bazar. They even cheat us in weight." Big difference in the price of commodities was found in the two markets. At Karwan Bazar, for instance, green chilli sells at Tk 72 a kg in the wholesale market, but at New market it is Tk 100. Huq told journalists, "Prices of essentials except green chilli, ginger and aubergine neither fell nor did they rise much. However, if the receipt is given properly the price of these commodities will come down." "The prices did not rise much compared with last Ramadan. We will monitor for a few more days. If we find the price rise is continuing we'll seek assistance of the law-enforcement agencies." Asked why they came to monitor the market after the prices had made a big jump, he said, "We'd been monitoring the prices in our way for sometime." The FBCCI monitoring team included vice president Abul Kashem Ahmed, Abu Alam Chowdhury and convenor of FBCCI price monitoring cell Kamal Uddin Ahmed. bdne
