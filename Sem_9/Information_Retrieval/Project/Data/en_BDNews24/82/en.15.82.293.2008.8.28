 LONDON, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fast bowler Steve Harmison made himself available on Thursday for England's coming tours of India and the West Indies after being recalled to the team against South Africa this month. "I've enjoyed coming back so I'm now back in the selectors' hands," the 29-year-old told BBC radio. "It's up to them now what squad they pick because I'm not selected for India. If I get selected to go to India, then I'll be on the plane. I'm available. I'm coming back to play cricket," he added. Harmison grabbed four wickets in England's victory in the final test against South Africa at the Oval this month on his return to the test team after a five-month absence. The Durham county player also came out of retirement from one-day internationals this month, claiming figures of two for 43 in 10 overs in the opening victory against South Africa at Headingley. He also took two wickets in one over in England's demolition of the Proteas in the second one dayer at Trent Bridge. "I came back and played at Headingley and the way things are looking, I'm available for the winter," Harmison, who has said in the past that he did not want to be away from his young family, told Sky Sports News ahead of Friday's third ODI at the Oval. "I've got four young children, and I miss them dearly when I go away from home, but once I have said I was available, I'm available. It's a lot more stable now than when I retired. "They (the family) are a massive part of my life and they always come first and I've been criticised for that but that will never change," he added. "But they are fully 100 percent behind me...they said go for it and give it your best shot." England are due to play two tests and seven one dayers in India in November and December before travelling to the West Indies in January-March
