"The second crucial step is ensuring quality participation, which warrants a qualitative overhaul of a whole lot of electoral machinery and behaviour." "It's the political leaders who must behave appropriately and conduct themselves as the changing scenario demands, so that holding a meaningful and fair election is possible and the chaotic dramas of the past do not take place." Asked if the election environment would be jeopardised in case the envisaged changes do not materialise, Hossain Zillur said: "We're trying to address possible deterrents well in advance."
