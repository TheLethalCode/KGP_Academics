 LONDON, Sep 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former England batsman Graeme Hick will retire from county cricket at the end of the season, his Worcestershire team said on their website (www.wccc.co.uk) on Tuesday. The 42-year-old, who has been suffering from a long-term elbow injury, will later this month bring the curtain down on an illustrious county career that never quite translated to the international stage. The Zimbabwean-born Hick has averaged 52.23 with the bat and became the 16th player to pile up more than 40,000 first-class runs. He was named by Wisden as one of their cricketers of the year in 1987 and this year scored his 136th century, placing him eighth on the all-time first-class list. The hard-hitting batsman averaged 31.32 in 65 tests for England after making his debut against West Indies at Headingley, Leeds in 1991. Hick had peaks and troughs of form for his adopted country and was in and out of the side until he made his final appearance for England against Sri Lanka in Kandy seven years ago. He also had spells with Queensland and New Zealand teams Northern Districts and Auckland
