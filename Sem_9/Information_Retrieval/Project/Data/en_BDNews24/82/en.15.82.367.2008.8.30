<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka Mohammedan Sporting Club sank their Chittagong namesakes to move into the final of the Citycell Federation Cup with a 3-1 win in an all Mohammedan semifinal at Bangabandhu National Stadium Saturday. Archrivals Mohammedan SC and Abahani Limited will square off in the final Monday at the same venue. Nigerian striker Alamu Bukola Olalenkan, his strike pair Mohammad Robin and Egyptian Hazem Khaled Mahmud struck one goal each for Mohammedan while Chamrin Rakhain scored the consolation for Chittagong Mohammedan. Both sides could hardly impress some 5,000 spectators with Dhaka Mohammedan appearing to struggle against the port side, who clearly dominated the first 20 minutes until their number one choice goalkeeper Mamun Khan left the field with an injury to allow Uttam Barua under the Chittagong Mohammedan post. Chittagong Mohammedan gave Dhaka Mohammedan scares twice with two long-range shots in the first five minutes though Mohammedan's goalkeeper Aminul Haq palmed both efforts away. The visitors came close to taking a lead in the ninth minute when Anthony Pele Doe headed a Sharif corner to Tommi M Tuckile, who saw his close-range header blocked by Aminul. Dhaka Mohammedan was deprived of a lead midway of the first half when Arman Aziz rattled the opponents' crossbar with a measured lob from the right and it forced the Chittagong goalkeeper, who slipped while trying to clear the lob to leave the field after getting hurt, paving a way for Uttam Barua. Uttam saved a close-range shot from Robin in the 34th minute, but two minutes later, failed to negotiate a header from tournament's highest scorer Olalenkan, who rose high to head an Aram free kick past Uttam to raise his goal tally to eight in four matches. From then, Mohammedan took control in the midfield and yielded two more chances before the break, but both efforts from Hazem and Robin went in vain. After the breather, Dhaka Mohammedan pressed hard for a second and Robin only to beat the opponent goalkeeper, drove an Olalenkan pass straight to Uttam three minutes into the second half. In the just the next minute, Robin made it 2-0 with a superb lob outside the box as keeper Uttam had nothing to do sans seeing the ball go home. Robin should have scored his second in the 58th minute, but keeper Uttam managed to clear it at the cost of a corner. Chittagong Mohammedan came close to reducing the margin in the 63rd minute when a Doulat lob from the right hit the woodwork to deprive the visitors, who, however, got their first goal in the 70th minute. Charmin Rakhain nodded a Linkon free kick home to bring back Chittagong Mohammedan in the match before Hazem scored his tournament's first goal to seal the match in the 72nd minute. Capitalising on a cutback from Olalenkan, Hazem hammered a low drive from inside the box that found the back of the net with a little deflection from an opponent defender. Chittagong Mohammedan also found the net for the second time with a strike from Chamrin, but it was ruled off-side.
