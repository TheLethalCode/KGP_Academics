<TITLE> Can Abahani stop Olalekan in classic finale? </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com)  Abahani Limited and Mohammedan Sporting Club renew their classic rivalry after eight years on Monday in the final of the season's curtain-raiser Federation Cup. The match will start at 4:30pm with state-run television BTV telecasting the match live from Bangabandhu National Stadium. Bangladesh Betar will also be giving live commentary. Apart from lifting the inaugural B. League title last year, Abahani have failed to win any silverware in major tournaments since their seventh Federation Cup title and National League championship triumphs in 2000. The Sky Blues are desperate to end their title drought by winning the final against the arch-foes on the football pitch. "Our main object is to clinch the title whoever the opponents are and I think we are on the right track," Abahani's long-serving coach Amolesh Sen told bdnews24.com on the eve of the longed-for finale. Mohammedan have better slice of luck in terms of silverware they lifted the Federation Cup twice and became National League championsafter 2000. The Black and Whites are also sanguine about taking home what would be their ninth Federation Cup title, which was introduced in 1980. "All the players are in the positive frame of mind and looking forward to the final," said Mohammedan coach Maruful Haq, who is coaching the giants for the first time in his career. He favours 3-5-2 formation with a packed midfield to keep the striker pair of Nigerian Alamu Bukola Olalekan and Mohammad Robin on the frontline. The strikers have already paid rich dividends scoring 12 goals between them and Olalekan has scored eight goals including a hat-trick in four outings to help Mohammedan to the final. The Motijheel-based outfit will pin their hopes on the Nigerian marksman, although Abahani will doubtless try to give him little space. The Abahani coach also indicated that Olalekan would be closely marked. "If a team depends on one player, then it is easy to stifle them by closing on that man," he said. The Mohammedan coach said he was also aware of the fact and was also banking on striker Robin, who has scored four goals in five matches. Maruf also rated the Abahani backline of Nazrul Islam, Mohammad Sujan, Wali Faisal and Ugandan Samad Yussif high. Mohammedan go into the match with a shaky defence with defenders Jewel Rana, Hasan Al Mamun and Rajani Kanta Barmon often failing to marshal their territory well. Abahani's Ugandan striker Awudu Ibrahim and promising Jahid Hasan Emily will look for loopholes to punish them. Sen was a worried over holding midfielder Arif Khan Joy and Mehdi Hasan Ujjal as Joy sustained a groin injury while Ujjal is recuperating from fever. But the inclusion of suspended defender Nazrul and injured midfielder Mamun Mia should lift the side. Mohammedan may miss the service of playmaker Arman Aziz. Bangladesh Football Federation president Kazi Salahuddin will witness the final to distribute prizes among the winners. b
