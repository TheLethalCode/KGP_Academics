<TITLE> Murray proves fitness in tough five setter </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - If anybody doubted Andy Murray's fitness, the British sixth seed proved them wrong on Saturday when he came back from two sets down to win a marathon five setter at the U.S. Open. He celebrated his 6-7 4-6 7-6 6-1 6-3 third-round victory over Austrian Juergen Melzer by pumping his muscles in a gesture that seemed to say "Take that" to those who questioned whether he had the stamina. Plagued with injuries and doubts about his fitness in long matches as a teenager, Murray went to Florida at the end of last year in the off-season and increased the intensity of his training, working hard in the gym to lift his fitness levels. Now 21, he says he's grown up and able to train hard. "When I played Wimbledon the first time, I had never played four sets in my life, never mind five," Murray told reporters. "I did start to work hard after that. But you have to respect your body as well. And I was still doing a lot of growing. "You can't push yourself too hard. It's not good for your body. Now I've finished growing and I can do more weights and train harder. "It's much easier to do all that stuff now. When you're sort of 17 and 18, I think it's tough on the body to push so hard," Murray said, after enduring a match that lasted three hours and 52 minutes in the heat and humidity of New York. The 27-year-old Melzer, who took the first two sets but suffered cramps and was struggling to run down shots in the final set, admitted he ran out of steam. "In the end I think the fitter player won," he said. Murray said he felt good and paid tribute to his trainers. "There are a lot of different emotions going through your head, when you're training and wondering why you do all the work and feeling sorry for yourself," said Murray, who will next face Swiss 10th seed Stanislas Wawrinka. "You kind of push through and keep working. Then when you have moments like that on the court, you feel like it's all worth it," he said. Murray said Saturday's match was even harder than his five set win over Frenchman Richard Gasquet at Wimbledon. "I was in danger in both matches but I felt like today Melzer was playing so well that it was going really tough for me to get back into the match," he said. Murray, who beat Novak Djokovic to won his first Masters Series title in Cincinnati this month, has now equalled his 2006 performance at the U.S. Open, but he said he was not ready to rest on his laurels. "There is a chance that I could win the tournament," Murray said. "I think it's better to set the bar high and maybe you don't reach it. I might not necessarily win this tournament but if I go with the intention of doing it, it might not come as such a surprise if I do go deep.
