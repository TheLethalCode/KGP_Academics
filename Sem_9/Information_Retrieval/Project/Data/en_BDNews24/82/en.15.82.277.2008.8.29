 Bangkok,Aug 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hundreds of Thai riot police climbed into the occupied compound of the prime minister's office on Friday to deliver a court order for the eviction of protesters trying to overthrow the government. The police posted the order on lampposts and barricades in the compound and surrounding streets. Scuffles broke out between the police and sentries posted by the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD), which occupied the seat of government on Tuesday. Witnesses said teargas was fired, but police denied it. At least 15 protesters were arrested and the police forced open three of five padlocked gates into the compound, a Reuters reporter said, but they did not move to evict everyone. On a bridge leading to the compound, hundreds of riot police armed with batons and shields faced off 10 meters (yards) away from a barricade manned by jeering PAD followers. The PAD, whose 2005 protests against then Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra contributed to his removal in a coup a year later, have vowed to remain inside the Government House compound until the current elected administration falls. PAD leaders urged other demonstrators to join the 4,000-strong crowd at the compound. "Move in and circle around me. We can't let them seize our stage too easily," retired general and PAD leader Chamlong Srimuang said. The PAD leaders have been charged with trying to overthrow the government through violent insurrection, a crime that can carry the death penalty. The PAD, a motley group of businessmen and academics, accuses Samak's coalition government of being an illegitimate proxy of Thaksin, now in exile in London. They have barricaded themselves in the compound with razor wire and car tires since Tuesday, and posted sentries armed with bars and golf clubs to repel police. Thailand's stock market turned lower after the riot police moved in. The index opened higher but was down 0.46 percent at 0435 GMT, bucking the trend elsewhere in Asia. Pressure is growing on the seven-month-old administration with rail workers widening a strike started on Thursday. "We have told our union members to call a leave of absence to join the rally in Bangkok to oust this government, which has been damaging the country over the past seven months," State Railway of Thailand union leader Savit Kaewvan told Reuters. Savit, who is also head of the umbrella group of all the state enterprises' labor unions with 200,000 members, said he expected other state unions to call for strikes
