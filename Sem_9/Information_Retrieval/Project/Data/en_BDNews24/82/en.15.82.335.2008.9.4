 NEW YORK (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serena Williams twice came from behind to complete a heart-stopping 7-6 7-6 win over her older sister Venus and claim a place in the U.S. Open semi-finals on Wednesday. She will face Dinara Safina in the semifinal Friday. In another quarterfinal Wednesday, the sixth-seeded Russian beat 16th-seeded Flavia Pennetta 6-2, 6-3, in 71 minutes. In a match of high quality where no quarter was given, Serena trailed 5-2 in the second set tiebreak before clawing her way back to seal victory in two hour 25 minutes. Twice champion Serena, the fourth seed, saved eight set points in the second set before seventh-seeded Venus hit a forehand long to surrender the match. "It definitely felt like a final of the U.S. Open, it was so hard," a breathless Serena said in a courtside interview. "I can't believe I won it. Wow! "It is difficult, mostly because she is such a great player. She was serving balls at 125, 127 mph and I just tried to stay with her." Serena edged ahead 9-8 in overall meetings between the siblings.

After the next two games went with serve, Venus seized an early advantage in the tiebreak to lead 6-4 before Serena fought back to clinch the opening set in 66 minutes. Venus again took the initiative in the second set, breaking Serena in the sixth game to open up a commanding 5-3 lead. With the set seemingly within her grasp, she streaked into a 40-love lead on serve before inexplicably squandering three set points with a vulnerable backhand. Serena, who had been pinning her sister to the baseline with deep groundstrokes, earned a breakpoint which she won when Venus narrowly hit a backhand wide of the line. The second set also went into a tiebreak and again the big-serving Venus appeared to be in control, earning a standing ovation after she won a protracted rally to take a 5-2 lead. Serena, champion here in 1999 and 2002, refused to buckle and, with Venus beginning to lose control of her groundstrokes, the younger sister finally booked her place in the last fou
