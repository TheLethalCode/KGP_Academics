 Dhaka, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com)  Prisons authorities have yet to receive all documents on bails secured by the BNP senior joint secretary general, said a senior prisons official Thursday. "I heard that Tarique Rahman secured bail in all his cases. Prisons authorities have received papers relating to bails in seven cases so far. We are reviewing them," deputy inspector general of prisons major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told bdnews24.com. The entire process of releasing Tarique might take a few more days, he added. The Appellate Division had earlier in the day granted Tarique eight weeks' bail on medical grounds in a bribery case linked to the murder of Bashundhara Group director Humayan Kabir Sabbir. Tarique's lawyer Rafique-ul-Huq said after the ruling there was no further obstacle to Tarique's release from detention as he had secured bail in the last of the 13 cases that had been pending against him. "The last legal hurdle has been removed with the ruling," Rafique told bdnews24.com. The other 12 cases against Tarique include charges of embezzlement in the Zia Orphanage Trust case and four extortion cases. On Wednesday, the High Court granted Tarique bail in a total of five cases, including three extortion cases, a tax-dodge case and a case on charges of accumulating illegal assets. Another case involving the directorship of the Daily Dinkal has been disposed of previously. The detained elder son of detained former prime minister Khaleda Zia is undergoing treatment at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital after his arrest on March 7. bdnew
