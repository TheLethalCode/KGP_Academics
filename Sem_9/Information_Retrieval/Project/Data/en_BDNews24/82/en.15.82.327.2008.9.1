 BERLIN, Sept 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bayern Munich won 4-1 at home to Hertha Berlin on Sunday to clinch their first Bundesliga victory under new coach Juergen Klinsmann and move within two points of the leaders. After two draws from the opening two matches of the season, former Germany coach Klinsmann was badly in need of a win and it was never in serious doubt once Luca Toni had struck the first early on. Philipp Lahm scored a brilliant second after the break, and penalties from Bastian Schweinsteiger and Miroslav Klose sealed victory before Marko Pantelic got a late consolation goal. "I think finally we're on our way," Klinsmann said after the game. "The win will have done us a lot of good." Victory took Bayern up to seventh place with five points from three matches. Schalke lead with seven points following their 1-0 derby win over Bochum on Saturday, with Hamburg SV and Borussia Dortmund behind them on goal difference. VfB Stuttgart, champions in 2007, moved up to fifth place on six points thanks to a 2-0 win at home to Hanover 96 on Sunday. Toni, who top scored in the Bundesliga with 24 goals last season only to endure a terrible time with Italy at Euro 2008, looked to be back near his best for Bayern on Sunday. The burly striker used deft footwork to turn past the covering defender on the edge of the area before slotting in the opening goal in the 12th minute. The second goal from Lahm was even better. The full-back brought the ball forward and played a one-two with Ze Roberto before picking his spot to the keeper's left nine minutes after the break. The other two goals came from borderline penalty decisions for Bayern, who will feel they needed something to go their way after two draws from two decent performances in the opening two games. Like Toni, Mario Gomez had a dreadful Euro 2008 after a devastating spell in the Bundesliga last season. On Sunday the Germany striker also showed signs of a return to form as he lashed in the first for Stuttgart in the 18th minute. The clinching second came via a Pavel Pardo penalty five minutes before the break
