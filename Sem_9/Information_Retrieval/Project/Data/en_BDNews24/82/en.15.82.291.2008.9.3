 Barisal, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com)  A court has summoned Barisal mayor-elect Shawkat Hossain Hiron and 15 others after a defeated candidate in the Aug 4 polls filed a petition challenging the election results. Judge Oheduzzaman of the 1st Joint District Judge and Electoral Court gave the order Wednesday. S Sharfuddin Ahmed Santu, the defeated candidate, made the 16 respondents who included the returning officer and five presiding officers. The petition, filed Tuesday, stated that delays were deliberately created over declaring the election results, and that the results were tampered with in the control room. The media had also reported the same at the time, the petitioner said. Mayor-elect Hiron also applied to the returning officer to negate the results on the night, Santu added. He also brought allegations against Hiron for concealing information on debts. bdnew
