<TITLE> Bails, stay orders harming ACC image: Hasan Mashhud </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 1 (bdnews24.com)  Anticorruption Commission chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury said Monday that the spate of bail orders for graft suspects and stay orders on corruption cases has hurt the image of the antigraft body. "It may seem to people that the ACC is not working the way it did before. Nothing should be concluded until the apex court of the country gives verdicts in the cases," Hasan Mashhud told reporters in his office. "But the High Court works independently. The ACC has nothing to do with that process," he said. "Some people think the cases have not been properly handled, which is why the corruption suspects are getting bail. But the fact is that all cases were filed and charge sheets submitted in consultation with lawyers," he stressed. The ACC chief regretted that few cases would see final disposal before the national polls. "Writ petitions were filed against many cases. It will take time to revive the cases by filing counter appeals," he said. Pointing out that the special courts have so far given verdicts in 80 cases, he emphasised: "There is no flaw with the ACC cases." He said a public prosecutor was appointed to maintain contact between lawyers and the ACC. In addition to this, a monitoring cell has been formed to keep a check on the progress of the cases. "A director general oversees the prosecution activities," he added. He said charge sheets have been submitted in 200 cases so far. Lawyers are being assigned for cases on the basis of the types of cases and the field of interests of the lawyers. "The ACC does not take any decision giving anybody any special treatment. The commission is if anything more cautious about the high profile cases," he said. The ACC chief added that the commission also undertook a variety of programmes to combat corruption at the upazila level. bdnew
