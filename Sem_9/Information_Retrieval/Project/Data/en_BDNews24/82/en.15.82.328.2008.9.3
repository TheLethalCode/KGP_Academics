<TITLE> Siddons apologises to Bangladesh fans </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Darwin, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com) - A day that had started on the wrong foot for the Tigers with the first ball dismissal of Tamim Iqbal never got better and Australia's eight-wicket win at the TIO Stadium Wednesday only confirmed how easy it has been for the world champions to secure the Commonwealth Bank series. Mohammad Ashraful had won the toss yet again but this time gambled on batting on a pitch that apparently looked 'better' than the one used for the first ODI where the Tigers had fielded first. But Tamim was squared up by the first delivery of the game bowled by Nathan Bracken and edged to slip while fellow opener Mehrab Hossain (1) just chased another Bracken delivery and gave catching practice to Mike Hussey. Then it was Ashraful's (3) turn to bring the slips into play again. The skipper went hard at a Stuart Clark away swinger and offered a simple catch to Cameron White to leave Bangladesh on 15/3 in the sixth over and the match was as good as over for the tourists. "It was a half volley and a four ball. It just swung too much. The ball was swinging a lot early on and that is only natural. It would swing in the first 6-7 overs whether you bowl first or second and it is our responsibility as batsmen to see off that period. We again failed to do that," Ashraful was quoted as saying by tigercricket.com, the official website of the Bangladesh Cricket Board. "It is very disappointing. We are unable to implement what we are practising and planning. Everyone knows and we know that we are a much better team than this and we can play much better cricket. It's just not happening for us at the moment," Ashraful added. Ashraful also refused to see the team making 117 as an improvement from the first ODI where they were bundled out for 74. "The disappointment is the same. Improvement would have been scoring over 200 and pushing Australia. "I thought we had confidence in the batting department after the practice matches where we twice made 300-plus scores and crossed 270 twice. But after the first match I guess the confidence has suffered a bit." The captain said the only comforting feature was the bowling of Mashrafe Bin Mortaza and Shakib Al Hasan. Shakib in his 50th ODI bamboozled Australian opener Shane Watson and also saw the back of captain Michael Clarke for the second game running. Clarke's one was his wicket number 50 in ODIs. Mortaza went for only 30 off his nine overs and had man of the match Shaun Marsh dropped by Alok Kopali at slips. "They again stood out but the bowlers had nothing to bowl at as we didn't give them any runs to play with," said Ashraful. Coach Jamie Siddons said he was sorry for the Bangladesh supporters after another poor show. "On behalf of the team I want to apologise to our fans around the world and all those who are supporting us back home. I can assure you that we are a much more capable side and we will do a lot better against New Zealand at home and maybe even in the last ODI here." The Tigers have optional training at the Marrara Oval Thursday morning. b
