<TEXT>
 LONDON, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jacques Kallis will take over from the injured Graeme Smith as South Africa captain for the third one day international against England, coach Mickey Arthur said on Thursday. South Africa need to win Friday's match at the Oval to keep the series alive after being thrashed by 10 wickets in the second ODI at Nottingham on Tuesday but Smith will be absent due to a persistent elbow problem. "Graeme, from the last test match and the start of the one dayers, has been pretty much playing on borrowed time with his elbow unfortunately," Arthur told Sky Sports News. "He tried to battle it out as much as he could but after Trent Bridge we just realised he couldn't go any more," he added. "We are going to rest and rehab Graeme and get him ready for the start of our home series which is Bangladesh in November and then Australia. Graeme needs the time off now.
