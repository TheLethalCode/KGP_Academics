 Dhaka, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com)  Tax authorities will ask no questions of new taxpayers about their income and will welcome any amount they pay in taxes for the next three years, the National Board of Revenue chairman said on Wednesday. "Those who spontaneously register as taxpayers will not face any questions for three years," Md Abdul Mazid told representatives of various clubs of Dhaka and Narayanganj at his office. "The NBR will accept any amount they pay during the period." Mazid said only 22 lakh out of 15 crore people of the country had a Tax Identification Number. "But not all of them pay taxes." He said the NBR moved to find new taxpayers from across the country and steps have been taken to expand the tax net to upazilas. Explaining the need for tax, the NBR chief said, "We have to develop our country with our own money. It is not possible to be self-reliant with foreign aid." He said, "A lion's share of the money coming in foreign aid goes on interests and foreign consultants." Referring to Bhairab bridge, Mazid said the British government had paid  70 million in loan to construct the bridge on condition that the bridge must be constructed by British firms. Bangladesh had to pay  8 million in compensation to a British consultancy firm following its feud with the British construction firm. Mazid said, "We would not be depending on foreign aid for Bhairab bridge if people of Bangladesh did pay taxes regularly. We could have constructed it at a much lower cost." Representatives from Dhaka Club, Officers Club, Gulshan Club, Uttara Club, Narayanganj Club and Rotary Club were present. bdnew
