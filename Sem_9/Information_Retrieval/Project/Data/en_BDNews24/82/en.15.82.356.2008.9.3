<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com) - It was another Abahani-Mohammedan clash in three days and this time Mohammedans again came out successful, handing a 3-1 defeat to Abahani in the One-day Futsal Veterans' Tournament final Wednesday. Sabbir struck two goals while Bokhtiar netted one goal for the Black & White outfit. Jakir scored the lone goal for the Sky-Blue outfit at the Wood-Floor Gymnasium adjacent to Bangabandhu National Stadium. Meanwhile, Mohammedan thrashed Abahani 3-2 in a tiebreaker following a 1-1 lock in the regulation time to clinch the season's curtain-raiser Federation Cup on Monday. Though it was a clash of the veterans, there were all elements of the Abahani-Mohammedan five-a-side affair as the players from both sides protested the referees' decisions whenever it went against them and took the 30-minute match seriously with chasing each other hard on the wooden-floor pitch. Abahani comprising keeper Mamun, Iqbal, Amolesh Sen, Swapan and Jakir took a lead riding on a Jakir strike as the medio slammed a substitute Rupu cross past Kanon before Manik rattled the Abahani sidebar. After going one-goal down, Mohammedans brought Bakhtiar in place of Johnny and the little man, shrugging off his marker defender Swapan, drove a left-footer to level the margin. Mohammedan initially comprising Sabbir, Manik, Johnny, Titu and Kanon brought four more changes in the second half with Ponir, Kaiser and Nakib replacing Kanon, Manik and Sabbir. Abahani also drafted Yousuf, Aslam, Gaus and Munna Jr to their side, and hardly had an impact on the match with only Jakir and Iqbal seemingly physically fit on the pitch. The pair of Sabbir and Manik often treated the Abahani defense and Sabbir struck two goals in five minutes to seal the match. On way to the final, Abahani beat Farashganj 8-1 in the first semifinal with Iqbal striking a hat-trick while Munna and Jakir struck two goals each and Gaus netted the rest for Abahani. The Dhanmondi-based outfit also beat Arambagh KS 4-1 as Amolesh Sen struck two goals and Iqbal and Jakir scored one goal each. In the semifinal, Mohammedans recorded a 6-0 win over the National Sports Council, who stunned Brothers Union 2-0 in the knockout tournament. Nakib struck a hat-trick against NSC for Mohammedan, who also demolished Farashganj 7-0 with Manik scoring a hat-trick. In the group-phase match, Rahmatganj MFS thrashed Bangladesh Sports Writers Association 7-2 with Gilani striking five goals including a hat-trick.
