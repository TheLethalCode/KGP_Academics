 LONDON, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Life is rarely dull at Premier League club Manchester City and Monday's proposed takeover of the club by an Abu Dhabi-based company marks the latest chapter in the life of one of English football's most colourful clubs. Just hours after confirming a likely change of ownership City stunned the Premier League's big guns by beating the British transfer deadline to sign Brazilian Robinho from Real Madrid for a fee reported to be 40 million euros. Since winning the English title in 1968 the club has lived in the shadow of Manchester United and has specialised in false dawns. Not for no reason do the fans serenade their team with the sentimental ballad "Blue Moon". In the 22 years that Alex Ferguson has spent gathering 10 Premier League titles, two European Cups and a sackful of domestic trophies, City have been mired in self-inflicted mediocrity and broken dreams. The low point came in 1999 when they were relegated to the third tier of English football. Since then they have regained their rightful place in the top flight without ever threatening to challenge for silverware. Eleven managers have tried, and failed, to restore City's fading glamour during Ferguson's glittering reign. The job proved too much for Kevin Keegan and Sven-Goran Eriksson, another former England manager, who joined the City scrapheap in June after just a season in charge. Not even a rare league double over United and a back-door entry into the UEFA Cup could save Eriksson whose last game in charge was an 8-1 defeat at Middlebrough. Mark Hughes, once a favourite at Old Trafford, is the latest occupant of the hot seat and after two wins from three games hope is high in the blue half of the city that the club can start to punch its weight. With money now apparently no object, City made an audacious bid to sign Bulgarian striker Dimitar Berbatov from under the noses of United. That failed, but the capture of Robinho sparked late night celebrations. UNLIKELY SAVIOUR "For me it's not about the money. We need somebody giving us stability. In the past 30 years we haven't had any success and we're desperate to win a trophy," Kevin Parker, secretary of the club's official supporters club, said on Monday. This time last year former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra was hailed as an unlikely saviour when he bought the club for 81 million pounds ($146.3 million). The fact that a chunk of his fortune was frozen in Thailand after he was removed in a 2006 coup and he faced corruption charges did not prevent him recruiting Swede Eriksson and splashing the cash on a rash of signings. Thaksin spoke of his desire to make City the "pride of Thailand" but after a promising start soon realised that making them the pride of Moss Side, the working class home of the club's impressive stadium, would be tougher than first expected. Now Thaksin's suitability to run a football club has been called into question again after the Thai Supreme Court issued an arrest warrant for the 59-year-old last month. He was even reported to be ready to step down. Prospective new owners, Abu Dhabi United Group for Development and Investment, spelt out their vision for City on Monday in no uncertain terms. "Our goal is very simpleto make Manchester City the biggest club in the Premier League," board member Sulaiman al-Fahim was quoted in Arabian Business magazine. "We are trying to be in the top four this season and we will buy whatever is needed." After the trials and tribulations of the past few years it is music to the ears of diehard City fans, even if the realists among them will say they have heard it all before
