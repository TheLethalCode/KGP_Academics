 Darwin, September 3 (bdnews24.com)  Australia beat Bangladesh by eight wickets in the second one-day international in Darwin Wednesday to clinch the three match series with a match to spare. The visitors continued to struggle with their batting as they were bundled out for just 117 in 36.1 overs. In reply, the world champions cruised home in 22.4 overs with Shawn Marsh scoring his second consecutive fifty. He was not out on 69 as Australia scored 118/2. Bangladesh lost opener Tamim Iqbal in the first ball of the match after skipper Mohammad Ashraful had won the toss and decided to bat first. The debacle continued as they lost wickets at regular intervals. Only a defiant 30 off 36 balls by wicketkeeper Dhiman Ghosh took them past the three figure mark. Apart from him, Junaed Siddique (21) and Shakib al-Hasan (19), who shared 38 runs in the fourth wicket partnership could put up some resistance. For Australia, Mitchel Johnson took three wickets for 17 runs, while Nathan Bracken, Stuart Clarke and Cameron White took two each. Bangldesh were all-out for 74, their lowest total ever, in the first match and lost by 180 runs.
