 Dhaka, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com)  A blaze at the 23-storey Faruque Rupayan Tower near Banani market was doused by firefighters Sunday, after spreading up from the basement shortly before 4.30pm. The tower's security guard Mansur told bdnews24.com that a microbus caught fire as its engine started up in the building's underground car park and the fire soon spread. Kemal Ataturk Avenue was closed off as firefighters battled the flames. Long traffic tail-backs were seen on roads leading into Banani. Firemen took just half an hour to douse the fire, but many people had to be rescued from the tower. Some were injured as they jumped out of windows. Witnesses had earlier said scores of people were trapped in the building while firefighters fought the flames. Firemen said heavy smoke spread panic among people but no casualties were reported. The injured were admitted to hospital. Mahfuz Ahmed, senior station officer of Kurmitola fire brigade, told bdnews24.com: "We are investing how the fire broke out. The blaze is under control. There is no estimate of damages at present until an investigation is done." bdnews24
