 ROME, Sept 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Italy coach Marcello Lippi recalled fit-again captain Fabio Cannavaro and striker Luca Toni on Sunday for their opening 2010 World Cup qualifiers against Cyprus and Georgia. Real Madrid defender Cannavaro returns after missing the world champions' unsuccessful Euro 2008 campaign with damaged ankle ligaments. A calf muscle tear stopped Bayern Munich's Toni taking part in Italy's 2-2 draw with Austria in a friendly earlier this month, the opening match of Lippi's second stint in charge of the national team. The striker will be looking to make amends for a disappointing showing in Austria and Switzerland and he found the net for Bayern on Sunday in their 4-1 league win over Hertha Berlin. Fiorentina defender Alessandro Gamberini returns from injury too, while midfielder Gennaro Gattuso has been called up despite missing AC Milan's 2-1 defeat by Bologna in Serie A on Sunday because of a shoulder knock he suffered against Austria. Centre back Marco Materazzi, a member of Lippi's 2006 World Cup-wining team like Toni, Gattuso and Cannavaro, has not been included in the squad after coming back from injury in Inter Milan's 1-1 draw at Sampdoria on Saturday. There was still no place for Sampdoria striker Antonio Cassano and Milan midfielder Massimo Ambrosini, both part of Roberto Donadoni's Euro 2008 squad. Milan's Daniele Bonera has been dropped as Cannavaro and Gamberini return but Juventus defender Nicola Legrottaglie kept his place after being called in as a late replacement for his injured club mate Giorgio Chiellini before the Austria friendly. Roma midfielder Simone Perrotta is unavailable because of an Achilles tendon problem. Lippi makes his competitive return to the Azzurri bench against Cyprus in Larnaca on Saturday after the World Cup-winner coach was recalled to replace Donadoni after Euro 2008. Italy then play Georgia in the northern city of Udine on Sept. 10. They also face Ireland, Bulgaria and Montenegro in European Qualifying Group Eight. Squad: Goalkeepers: Marco Amelia (Palermo), Gianluigi Buffon (Juventus), Morgan De Sanctis (Galatasaray); Defenders: Andrea Barzagli (VfL Wolfsburg), Fabio Cannavaro (Real Madrid), Marco Cassetti (AS Roma), Andrea Dossena (Liverpool), Alessandro Gamberini (Fiorentina), Fabio Grosso (Olympique Lyon), Nicola Legrottaglie (Juventus), Gianluca Zambrotta (AC Milan); Midfielders: Alberto Aquilani (AS Roma), Mauro Camoranesi (Juventus), Daniele De Rossi (AS Roma), Gennaro Gattuso (AC Milan), Angelo Palombo (Sampdoria), Andrea Pirlo (AC Milan); Forwards: Alessandro Del Piero (Juventus), Antonio Di Natale (Udinese), Alberto Gilardino (Fiorentina), Vincenzo Iaquinta (Juventus), Luca Toni (Bayern Munich)
