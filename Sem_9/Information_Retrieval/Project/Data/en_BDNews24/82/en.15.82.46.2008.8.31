 Dhaka, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh and India on Sunday agreed not to allow their territories to be used against each other's interests and to hand over criminals and 'insurgents' to their country of origin. But they failed to reach consensus on deportation of convicted criminals when home secretaries of two neighbours ended two-day talks in Dhaka. Home secretary Abdul Karim and his Indian counterpart Madhukar Gupta at the ninth meeting of the home secretaries, however, agreed their governments would detain criminals on either side of the border and deport them to their country of origin. Dhaka sought India's support in crushing anti-Bangladesh outfits in India, while Delhi asked for its help to track down Indian insurgents allegedly based in Bangladesh. India also demanded Bangladesh hand over the Indian criminals convicted in Bangladesh to let them serve out the remainder of their jail terms in India but Bangladesh disagreed. "We cannot hand over anyone who is serving jail terms. We will hand over only those who have served their jail terms," Karim told a press conference at home ministry after the talks. "We have sought India's cooperation to take preventive measures against anti-Bangladesh outfits based in India," said Karim. Gupta, the Indian home secretary, said they would not allow any anti-Bangladeshi campaign on Indian soil. "We have assured Bangladesh government that India will not allow any political activity against any country including Bangladesh," he told journalists. "India wants Bangladesh's cooperation to trace the presence of Indian insurgent groups reportedly based in Bangladesh," Gupta added. Karim said: "We also confirm that anti-state activities against any country including our friendly neighbour India will not be allowed [in Bangladesh]." The joint press statement of the meeting said, "As regards criminals who have taken shelter in either country to evade the process of law, both sides agreed to continue efforts to find them out and send them back expeditiously". India has been asking Bangladesh to deport northeast Indian separatist leader Anup Chetia since he was caught in Bangladesh in 1997. Chetia is now in jail. Delhi alleges that anti-Indian groups are operating from Bangladeshi territories, an allegation Dhaka denies. Again, Dhaka alleges that some groups in India have been carrying out anti-Bangladesh campaigns. India also denies Bangladesh's allegations. Both Bangladesh and India at the talks exchanged lists of criminals living in the two countries. The meeting decided that the 10th meeting would be held in New Delhi. India will also host a conference of narcotics departments of the two countries in New Delhi in October. bd
