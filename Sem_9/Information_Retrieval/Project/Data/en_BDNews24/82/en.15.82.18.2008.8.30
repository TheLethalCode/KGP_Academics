 Dhaka, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com)  Dhanmondi police took three people into custody on remand Saturday, after they were arrested on charges of receiving bribes from former judge and caretaker government adviser M Fazlul Huq, a police officer said. Chief metropolitan magistrate ME Islam Hossain approved three days' remand for interrogation, though police requested seven days, investigation officer of the case Amirul Islam told bdnews24.com. Amirul said the three arrested had already admitted they had taken Tk 24.50 lakh from Huq's family to help him evade graft charges. On Friday, the Detective Branch of police arrested the threeAmalendu Das, 50, Golam Ambia, 57, and Md Nuruzzaman Iqbal, 35,  on charges of receiving nearly Tk 25 lakh to get Huq off the Anticorruption Commission's graft list. Khandaker Toufique Alam, who claims to be a senior official at an NGO run by Fazlul Huq's son Dr Afzal Hossain, alleged that the three had taken a total of Tk 29.50 lakh from him, police said. "I would get in touch with them on behalf of the son of Justice Fazlul Huq," Alam, who is a witness in the case police filed after the arrests, told bdnews24.com. Investigation officer Amirul Islam said the transactions began on Oct 28 last year with a payment of Tk 4 lakh at the first instalment. "They might have taken bribes from others in similar circumstances," he added. Police assistant commissioner Nasiruddin Khan, who led the two-day operations leading to the arrests, had earlier told bdnews24.com Afzal had given the money in instalments to Ambia through Alam. Ambia, who hails from the former adviser's ancestral village in Rajshahi, later brought Amalendu and Nuruzzaman into the deal, he added. "Using his BTV press pass, Nuruzzaman accessed classified documents from the Anticorruption Commission on Fazlul Huq's assets," Nasiruddin said. The police official added they had come to know of the deal when Huq's family had asked for a refund from the three as the ACC had already pressed the graft charges against the former Supreme Court justice. Nasiruddin added Huq's family was to file a counter case soon. bdnew
