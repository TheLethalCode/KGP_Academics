 NEW YORK (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Second seed Jelena Jankovic cruised into the U.S. Open semi-finals with a 6-1, 6-4 win over 29th seed Sybille Bammer on Tuesday.

Jankovic, who reached the number one ranking briefly last month and could displace compatriot Ana Ivanovic at the top, has yet to reach a grand slam final having lost in the semis four times, including Flushing Meadows in 2006.

"She's a tough player, she's very solid, she moves great," Jankovic said about her semifinal opponent. "I would love to make another step forward and reach my first final of a grand slam
