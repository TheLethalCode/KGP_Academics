 Dhaka, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com)  Tarique Rahman's wife Zobaida Rahman and other visitors left his bedside at BSMMU Hospital late Tuesday evening in a clear sign that the detained BNP leader would not be released on bail before Wednesday. Inspector general of prisons Brigadier general Zakir Hasan had said earlier in the evening that detainees were not normally released if their papers were not processed by 6pm. However, a top prisons official told bdnews24.com: "Exceptions to the rule may be made in special cases." Zobaida had arrived at the hospital at 3:30pm, driving past crowds of BNP supporters who had gathered to cheer the elder son of detained party chief Khaleda Zia on his release. The inspector general of prisons had told bdnews24.com in the morning that almost all necessary papers for executing the release of Tarique had reached his office. "We are only awaiting the last remaining document now, which may be sent to us any time today (Tuesday). It is possible that Tarique Rahman will be released today provided the last bit of paper work is complete and it reaches us," Hasan said. The law-enforcement agencies arrested Tarique on March 8, 2007. He is currently under treatment in a prisons cell at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital. As many as 16 cases have been filed against Tarique. Of them, one case involving Daily Dinkal has been disposed of, while he got bail 12 on-trial cases. Authorities are yet to press charges in three other cases. The High Court on August 25 granted him six months' interim bail in a Tk 1 crore extortion case and on August 26, another four months' bail in the Zia Orphanage Trust corruption case. Tarique got bail in five cases on August 27, of which three involved extortion charges, one on income tax dodge and another on illegally acquired assets. On August 28, when the Supreme Court granted him bail in the case involving the suppression of Sabbir murder for which Tarique allegedly took huge sums of money, he got bails in all the 12 cases against him. Officials and his lawyers then said his release was only a matter of time required for procedure. bdnews24.
