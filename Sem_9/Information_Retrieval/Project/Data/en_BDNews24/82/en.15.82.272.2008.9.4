<TITLE> Thailand plans referendum to end crisis </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, Thu Sep 4, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thailand plans to hold a national referendum to end a political crisis over a street campaign against the government, embattled Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej said on Thursday after rejecting calls to quit. Analysts said the plan appeared to be a tactic to buy time and predicted that uncertainty was likely to persist, even though the dispute is centered on a Bangkok-based political elite and most Thais live in the countryside, where Samak has wide support. Samak said in a radio broadcast that he would urge the Senate to pass a pending referendum law quickly. "The campaign will last for a month in which both sides can do whatever electioneering they want," he said, adding that opposition activists who have barricaded themselves within his official compound could stay there during this period. Earlier in the day, a defiant Samak dismissed talk that he would quit or call a snap election to defuse the protests. "I will not jump ship, I will be in control," he said. The anti-government People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD), a mainly middle class grouping of royalists and businessmen whose activists took over the prime minister's compound in Bangkok 10 days ago, vowed to stay until Samak gave up. "As long as he insists on staying on, we will not go anywhere. It doesn't matter how many days or years, or even into the next life," PAD leader Sondhi Limthongkul told supporters. Cabinet spokesman Wichianchot Sukchotrat said government lawyers would decide what questions should be put to Thailand's 63 million people. One minister said the referendum could take the form of a national vote of confidence, which analysts said Samak's government was certain to win on the back of its solid support among poorer Thais in the countryside. "It may look genuine, but it also appears to be a tactic to buy time," political commentator Sukhum Nualskul said. THAKSIN PROXY? The PAD accuses Samak of being an illegal proxy for former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, ousted in a 2006 coup and now in exile in London. Their campaign has hit Thai stocks and the baht currency, which were already buffeted by high inflation and a global economic slowdown. "The philosophical difference between these two disparate groups will mean that there is unlikely to be any clear resolution any time soon," said Sin Beng Ong at JPMorgan. "Growth will continue to be affected by these tensions and politics could derail what had been an incipient recovery in domestic demand in July following the decline in energy prices." Thailand's five-year CDS -- insurance-like contracts that protect against defaults and restructuring -- widened by 4 basis points (bps) to 144 bps on Thursday. It is now some 25-30 basis points wider since the political problems began. Samak, 73, said in his morning broadcast that it was time for Thais to choose sides. "I want to avoid bloodshed. I want to avoid a crisis," he said, calling the PAD a lawless mob. "The rest of the country must decide if they will join them." Samak declared emergency rule after clashes between his supporters and anti-government protesters killed one man and injured 45, but the army has refused to use force to evict the protesters, saying it would only make the situation worse. While that was interpreted as a rebuff to the government, a sputtering strike by public sector employees at utilities, the railways and airports has not helped the PAD's cause. Besides the referendum, analysts say various other scenarios are also possible, including Samak calling a snap election as a last resort, or caving in to the protesters and resigning. Another possibility is revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej intervening in the crisis. Such a move would be unlikely to favor the government, even though it would be couched in nuanced terms, espousing the need for national harmony and stability
