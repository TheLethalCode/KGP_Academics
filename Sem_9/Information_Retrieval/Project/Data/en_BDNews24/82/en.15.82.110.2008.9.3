 Dhaka, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has formed a five-member committee to verify the applications from political parties for registration, an official said on Wednesday. "The committee is meant to check if the documents submitted by the parties were accurate," said AKM Salimullah, a deputy secretary at the EC secretariat. Joint secretary (law) of the EC Secretariat Nurul Islam Khan, deputy secretaries Jesmin Tuli, AKM Salimullah and Mihir Sarwar Morshed, and senior assistant secretary Farhad Ahmad Khan are sitting on the committee. The chief election commissioner had said earlier 50 parties to date have picked up forms. The committee will start scrutinising their applications when they hand in the forms. The EC, which says there are some 150 parties in the country, is set to hold talks with political parties on registration from Sept 6-9 after they some major parties expressed reservations about registration under new electoral laws. According to the laws, an application form must contain 10 pieces of information attested by the party general secretary. The information include name of the party and address of its headquarters, party constitution, election manifesto (if available), rules and regulations of the party, portrait of the party logo and flag, names and designations of all members in the central and equivalent committees, details of the bank account of the party and sources of funds. Every political party has to declare in writing that it meets all conditions for registration. The EC asked the political parties to submit application for registration by Oct 15. If any flaw is found in the application, parties would be given 15 days to correct and the EC reserves the right to reject any application. The registered parties must report to the EC on various matters and submit list of the members of new committee. To qualify for registration, a party must win one seat in national polls since independence or secure five percent votes in all constituencies contested by the party. The party must have committees in at least 10 districts. National polls candidates must belong to a registered political party or contest as an independent candidate, the new laws stipulate. bdnew
