 Bogra, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com) - Authorities of Bogra Shahid Ziaur Rahman Medical College were forced to close the college indefinitely Saturday, following clashes between activists of Bangladesh Chhatra League and Islami Chhatra Shibir. They ordered residential students to leave the halls by 5pm. At least 21 people on both sides were injured in the clashes between the two student organisations starting around 10.30pm Friday, over a trifling incident in a canteen of a students' hostel. As ransacking and arson occurred, police and fire service personnel rushed to the scene. Following the incident, BCL and other students organised a rally on campus and submitted a memorandum to the authorities. Student-manager of the canteen and BCL supporter, 'Saikat' said that Shibir activist 'Kollol' had written in the complaint book at the dining room that the quality of food was not good. An altercation then ensued in which Saikat slapped Kallol. Later, at about 11 pm, alleged Shibir activists attacked the students' hostel. A seven member team of the Chhatra League and general students submitted memorandums to college principal Prof Mahbubul Karim and the medical college hospital director Brig Gen Md Shafiqul Islam. They alleged that seven Shibir activists, led by the college's Shibir unit president, internee doctor Mollah Mokaddes, armed with about guns and sharp weapons were aided by outsiders in ransacking about 25 hostel rooms and beating up the residential students. Chhatra League said at least 15 of their number were injured. The memorandum demanded expulsion of the Shibir activists responsible for the attack, cancellation of Dr Mollah's internship, and banning entry of outsiders to the campus. Dr Mollah Mokaddes denied all allegations against him. He said he was on duty at the hospital on Friday night, and in no way involved in the incident. Bogra town Chhatra Shibir secretary Alimul Raji Moti said that six of their supporters were also injured in the clashes with Chhatra League. The college principal said that all classes and examinations had been suspended for an indefinite period to prevent further untoward incidents. Preparations were on to file a case with Sadar police for the ransacking of the college hostel rooms. The college hospital director said that after investigating the incident action would be taken against the persons responsible. The injured students were admitted to the college hospital. bdnews
