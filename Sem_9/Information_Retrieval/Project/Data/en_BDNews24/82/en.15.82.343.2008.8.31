 Dhaka, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com) - BNP secretary general Khandker Delwar Hossain expressed concern over the delay in releasing Tarique Rahman on Sunday, but said the party would go to dialogue with the governmentwith freed party chairperson Khaleda Ziaif they were assured of parliamentary elections ahead of any other polls. Speaking at a BNP discussion, he stressed once again: "BNP is an election-oriented party." "If the parliamentary election is held first, we are ready to hold talks with the government, taking our leader Khaleda Zia with us." "But BNP will not participate in any sham 'blue print' election," he added, echoing one of his earlier comments. Delwar also reiterated the party's demand for withdrawal of the state of emergency. "In 18 months this government has crippled the economy. They have created huge problems. They have failed in all areas. Only an elected government can overcome this crisis." Expressing concern at delay over the release of BNP senior joint secretary general Tarique Rahman, he said: "The High Court has granted bail to Tarique Rahman in all cases. It is inhumane that he has not yet been sent abroad for necessary treatment. We request the government not to create any obstacle in reaching the copy of the High Court bail orders to the jail authorities." Sunday's discussion on 'Three decades of BNP: Shaheed Zia and Khaleda Zia' was held at the Mohanagar Natya Mancha. Former vice chancellor of Dhaka University, Prof Emajuddin Ahmed addressing the discussion, said: "BNP became divided in 1981, but when it united again it became an invincible force." "Some misunderstanding has been created in the party in 2008. Those have to be removed and BNP united." BNP standing committee member Chowdhury Tanveer Ahmed Siddiqui presided. Fellow standing committee member Dr RA Gani, party vice presidents Prof Sarwari Rahman and MK Anwar, joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan, Dhaka University arts faculty dean Dr Sadrul Amin and journalist Amanullah Kabir also spoke. bdnew
