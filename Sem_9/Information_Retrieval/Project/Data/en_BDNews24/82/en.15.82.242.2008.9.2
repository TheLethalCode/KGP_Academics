<TITLE> A turnaround needed </TITLE>

 DARWIN, September 02 (bdnews24.com)-- The Bangladesh camp had remained quite since the batting debacle in the first ODI. Getting bowled out for 74 has hurt the image of the team and the players know that nothing short of a turnaround in the second match Wednesday would revive confidence. "We have to be much, much better. A good performance would be getting over 250 or even in the region of 220-230. That'd give us a chance. We know the bowlers now, we failed to adjust to the wicket in the first ODI but I'm quite confident that it will not happen again," said captain Mohammad Ashraful. The challenge for the Tigers has been lifting the battered confidence and coach Jamie Siddons spoke separately with the batsmen and the bowlers and emphasized on playing from the heart and not worry about what the opposition have in store. "Their bowlers and batsmen are no longer unknown. The pitch is also familiar now and hopefully our batsmen would concentrate on building the innings rather than playing shots which is not on, especially on this track," said Siddons. Bangladesh have been forced to make one change to the team. Batsman Roqibul Hassan has been ruled out due to a thumb injury and left-hander Zunaed Siddique gets his chance. Zunaed will open the batting with Tamim Iqbal. Australia have promised another ruthless performance but leg-spinner Cameron White, who took 3 for 5 in the first game reckons the series is far from over for the tourists. "They've got some dangerous players. They are very aggressive and probably at some stage of the series a couple of their batters will come off. We just have to make sure that we are switched on and don't take anything for granted," said White. The Tigers had divided net sessions at the TIO Stadium's nets and the Marrara Oval's center wicket in the afternoon. Wednesday's match starts at 9:30am local time (6:00am Bangladesh Standard Time). TEAMS Bangladesh: Tamim Iqbal, Zunaed Siddique, Mehrab Hossain, Mohammad Ashraful (Captain), Shakib Al Hasan, Alok Kopali, Dhiman Ghosh (Wicketkeeper), Mashrafe Bin Mortaza (Vice Captain), Abdur Razzak, Nazmul Hossain, Shahadat Hossain. 12th man  Mahmud Ullah Riyad Australia: Michael Clarke (Captain), Michael Hussey (Vice Captain), Nathan Bracken, Stuart Clark, Brad Haddin (Wicketkeeper), Shane Watson, David Hussey, Mitchell Johnson, Shaun Marsh, Brett Jeeves, Cameron White Umpires: Amiesh Saheba (India) & Bruce Oxenford(Australia) Match Referee: Javagal Srinath (India) Curtesy : tigercricket.c
