"We are now only awaiting the remainder document only, which may be sent to us any time today (Tuesday). It is possible that Tarique Rahman will be released today provided the last bit of paper work is complete and it reaches us," Gen Hasan said Tuesday morning. The law-enforcement agencies arrested Tarique on March 8, 2007. He is currently under treatment in a prisons cell at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital. As many as 16 cases have been filed against Tarique, one case involving Daily Dinkal has been disposed of, while he got bail 12 on-trial cases. Authorities are yet to press charges in three other cases. The High Court on August 25 granted him six months' interim bail in a Tk 1 crore extortion case and on August 26, another four months' bail in the Zia Orphanage Trust corruption case. Tarique got bail in five cases on August 27, of which three involved extortion charges, one on income tax dodge and another on illegally acquired assets. On August 28, when the Supreme Court granted him bail in the case involving the suppression of Sabbir murder for which Tarique allegedly took huge sums of money, he got bails in all the 12 cases against him. Officials and his lawyers then said his release was only a matter of time required for procedure. bdnew
