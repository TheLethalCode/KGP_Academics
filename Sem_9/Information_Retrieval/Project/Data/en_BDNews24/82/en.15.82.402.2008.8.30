 COLOMBO, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Sri Lanka scored a convincing 112-run victory in the fifth and final one-dayer on Friday to leave India as 3-2 series winners. India were bowled out for 103 after rain reduced their target from 228 to 216 in 44 overs, fast bowler Nuwan Kulasekera and spinner Ajantha Mendis sharing eight wickets. The game was interrupted with India on 70 for three in the 15th over. When it resumed after an 85-minute delay the visitors collapsed like a pack of cards, losing their last seven wickets for 33 runs. Earlier, an unbroken seventh-wicket partnership of 94 between Jehan Mubarak and Thilan Thushara helped Sri Lanka reach 227 for six in 50 overs after they had slumped to 133 for six. Mubarak finished 47 not out while all-rounder Thushara continued his excellent series with an unbeaten 54, his maiden one-day half-century. Sri Lanka got off to a poor start after Mahela Jayawardene won his first toss of the series. The hosts lost Sanath Jayasuriya for one when he top-edged a short ball from Zaheer Khan to third man. A 77-run stand between Malinda Warnapura and Mahela Udawatte lifted Sri Lanka before paceman Irfan Pathan dismissed both batsmen in quick succession. Warnapura was caught at cover for 30 while Udawatte was trapped lbw for 43 when he shuffled across his stumps. The innings lost momentum as Kumar Sangakkara's dismal form continued when he went for one and Jayawardene (12) and Chamara Kapugedera (26) were dismissed by left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha. Kulasekera, who took four top-order wickets, was named man of the match and India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni took the man of the series awar
