 Savar, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com)  Workers of a garment factory in Savar clashed with police, trying to foil their protests and clear a blockade on the Dhaka-Aricha highway, leaving at least 30 injured on Saturday, said witnesses. Hundreds of workers of Biswas Garments Private Limited took to the street around 1.30pm, placing a blockade near Rajfulbaria Bus Stand in protest against the non-payment of their outstanding salaries. Five factory workers, Ismail, Rana, Rubel, Munni, Rajia and Bakul, told bdnews24.com that had not received their salaries for the past two months. Savar police rushed to the scene but failed to disperse the protesters. At 2pm, factory director Al Mahmud assured the workers their salaries would be paid, but the workers continued their protest. Police baton-charged the workers to clear the Dhaka-Aricha highway, which triggered the clashes as the workers retaliated. RAB and army personnel were present during the clashes. Police eventually forced the workers to retreat around 4pm. bdnews2
