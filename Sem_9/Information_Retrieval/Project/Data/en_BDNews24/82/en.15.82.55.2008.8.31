 Dhaka, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com)  Trials of corruption cases against some politicians and civil society members lacked transparency, a local human-rights group says in a report to be tabled before the United Nations. Human Rights Forum on Universal Periodic Review Bangladesh, a platform of 17 non-government rights and development organisations, prepared the report and released it at a ceremony at the National Press Club on Sunday. According to the report, "Extrajudicial killings by law enforcement agencies continued. Death, rape and torture in custody remained a common feature. And the government showed no interest to publish investigation reports and try the people involved." Forum's coordinator Sayeed Ahmed presented the summary of the report that accused the caretaker government of harassing innocent people. It said the arrest of students and teachers by the interim government had raised questions. Besides, many innocent people were harassed and cases were filed against anonymous people. Sultana Kamal, executive director of Ain O Shalish Kendra, said the report would be sent to the United Nations on Monday. The report said non-disclosure of information on the relations between some political parties and militant outfits kept alive the risk of religious extremism. The government also failed to protect the right of minorities, it added. The report portrayed a painful picture of the obstacles to protecting the right of women, workers and disabled people. Corruption in education, health and other fundamental service sectors made it difficult to achieve the Millennium Development Goals set by the UN, Sayeed said. Bangladesh approved many international agreements on human rights but there was no development in sight to implement the projects, he added. The report was made on the basis of the situation of the country from Aug 2004. bdne
