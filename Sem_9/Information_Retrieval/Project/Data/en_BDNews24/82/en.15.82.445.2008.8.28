 Dhaka, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com)The High Court granted bail Thursday to BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, her elder son Tarique Rahman, BNP leader Salauddin Quader Chowdhury, Awami League leaders Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir, Obaidul Kader and former lawmaker Mosaddek Ali Falu in different cases. Three separate benches of the Supreme Court Thursday issued the orders on their separate appeals. A High Court bench of Justice Sharifuddin Chaklader and Justice Md Imdadul Haq Azad granted Khaleda Zia four months anticipatory bail in the Barapukuria coalmine case. The court also ordered the government and the Anticorruption Commission to show cause within the next six weeks why the former prime minister should not be given permanent bail. The same bench has previously granted Khaleda Zia bail in Zia Orphanage Trust corruption case. Her lawyer barrister Nasiruddin Ahmed Ashim told reporters that if she secured bail in the GATCO and Niko cases against her there would be no bar to Khaleda's release from jail. Meanwhile, a High Court bench on Thursday extended earlier stays on the proceedings in the GATCO and Niko corruption cases against Khaleda, by three months. A three-member bench of the Appellate Division, led by chief justice MM Ruhul Amin, granted two months bail to Tarique Rahman in a case filed accusing him of taking bribes for the cover up of the Sabbir murder. The court granted bail on health grounds. His lawyer barrister Rafique-ul-Huq told journalists that now was no further bar in Tarique's release from jail, as he had secured bail in all other cases pending against him. The HC bench of Justice Sharifuddin Chaklader and Justice Md Imdadul Haq Azad also granted anticipatory bail to Mosaddek Ali Falu Thursday in an illegal wealth case. A HC bench of Justice Tariqul Hakim and Justice Sheikh Abdul Awal granted Salauddin Quader Chowdhury six months bail in the case involving earning illegal wealth. The same bench stayed the proceedings of the case against Kamal Ahmed Majumder on charges of earning illegal wealth for six months and summoned the records of the case against AHM Mostafa Kamal (Lotus Kamal) for getting illegal property. A High Court bench of Justice Khademul Islam Chowdhury and Justice Mashuk Hossain Ahmed granted Awami League joint secretary Obaidul Kader three months bail in an income tax evasion case. An Appellate Division bench also upheld a High Court order staying a tax dodging case against former minister Dr Khandker Mosharraf Hossain. A High Court bench also stayed for six months the proceedings in a corruption case against former Awami League MP Kamal Ahmed Majumder. bdnew
