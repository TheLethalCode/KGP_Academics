 Dhaka, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com)  Long-standing boundary issues and curbing cross-border crime were high on the agenda as home secretaries of Bangladesh and India began a meeting in Dhaka Saturday. "We will look to hammer out security issues in the meeting," home secretary Abdul Karim told bdnews24.com Friday night. "Curbing criminals activities, narcotics smuggling and trafficking in women and children, and the Tin Bigha Corridor will be discussed in the meeting," Karim said, ahead of the meeting at the city's Sheraton Hotel. A delegation from India led by its home secretary Madhukar Gupta arrived in Dhaka on Friday afternoon. The Indian home secretary will meet with home adviser MA Matin on Sunday.
