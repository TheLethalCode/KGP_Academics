<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com)Awami League acting president Zillur Rahman added his voice Sunday to recent allegations by fellow party leaders, saying that BNP is directly collaborating with the caretaker government. Speaking after an AL working committee meeting, Zillur gave his reaction to Tarique Rahman's bail: "The people will put him on trial." AL acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam, also speaking to reporters at the AL president's political office, termed recent incidents of unrest "arranged drama to foil elections", "Ransacking in the roads and ransacking in the garments factories are indications of attempts to foil the election. This is arranged drama." As to who may be behind these incidents, he said: "Those who do not want election are staging these." Asked whether AL sees a recent meeting of four-party alliance leaders with Khaleda Zia in special jail as a conspiracy, Ashraful said: "It may be a conspiracy; it may be a part of their plan to foil elections in December." Ashraful told alleged Saturday that the government launched its anticorruption drive to pull the BNP-led four-party alliance from the abyss it had sunk into. "The anticorruption drive of the government was eyewash. The government is not sincere. The main aim of the government is to put Awami League and BNP on the same level. It has been proved now, " he had said. "If a person who is a 'world champion' in corruption is released the government does not have any moral right to keep others on similar charges behind bars. Before releasing him, all those who have been arrested on charges of corruption have to be freed," Ashraful demanded. "It is now clear that the real parties of the government are BNP and [Jamaat-e-Islami]," the AL acting general secretary had claimed Saturday. bdnews
