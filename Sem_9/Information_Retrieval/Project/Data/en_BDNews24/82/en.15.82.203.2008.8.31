 Dhaka, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com)  Areas in the Brahmaputra-Jamuna basin may face moderate flooding by Tuesday, the Water Development Board (WDB) said in a news briefing on Sunday. Executive engineer of Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre Md Saiful Hossain said at a press briefing at the WDB conference room at Motijheel said there was no need to panic. "The three river basins of the county experienced heavy rainfall in the last three to four days. The water level of other rivers is also rising under the impact of flash flood in the upstream. If it continues for the next three days the middle region of the country may face moderate flood." WDB director general Hossain Shahid Mojadda Faruque said, "The flood is approaching and we've taken cautions. All prior preparations to face the flood are complete. "Ten special teams have already reached different areas. From now on the Flood Forecasting Centre will remain open round the clock." He said the government has allocated Tk 82.50 crore to face emergency flood in the fiscal year 2008-09. WDB engineer Saiful said different areas in India including Mijoram and Nagaland, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in the Ganges basin, West Bengal, Arunachal, Assam and Meghalaya in the upstream of Jamuna and some parts of China experienced heavy rainfall under the impact of active monsoon. He said it was too early to say anything about the nature of the floods. bdnews24
