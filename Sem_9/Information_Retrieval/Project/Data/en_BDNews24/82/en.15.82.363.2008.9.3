 Sumon Mahmud bdnews24.com Chief Political Correspondent Dhaka, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com)  Tarique Rahman asked people to pray for his "speedy recovery" from illness and called for release of his mother Khaleda Zia from detention on Wednesday, as he was released on bail after 18 months in detention. "I'm ill. I'm grateful to the people of the country," he told bdnews24.com in his hospital room in his first reaction to the media following his release. Tarique, facing trial in a series of graft cases, asked the people to pray for him so that he could serve them better. He looked weak and ill, with his head bandaged after a recent fall in the hospital bathroom that sparked violent demonstrations by BNP supporters just days before. He was released from detention on bail at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital around 4:30pm on Wednesday. A line of people outside his room entered one by one to greet him and give flowers. Wife Zobaida Rahman was at his side minutes after authorities released the BNP leader who had spent 18 months in detention. Speaker Jamiruddin Sircar and deputy speaker Akhter Hamid Siddiqui joined BNP leaders and supporters visiting Tarique in his hospital room, shortly after 9pm and spent some 25 minutes there. Just hours earlier, deputy inspector general of prisons Shamsul Haider Siddiqui had emerged from Tarique's room at 4:30pm to announce to reporters that he had been released from police guard on bail. Tarique was admitted to the hospital on Jan 31 after months of reported illness in jail. Kazi Mazharul Islam Dolon, arthroscopic and joint replacement specialist at BSMMU hospital, said Tarique's physical condition remained the same. Tarique's lawyer Ahmed Azam Khan told bdnews24.com the ailing elder son of detained former prime minister and BNP chief Khaleda Zia will stay in the hospital Wednesday night. Prisons DIG Siddiqui had told bdnews24.com in the morning: "All documents related to Tarique's release are here. We'll scrutinise the legal papers which may take us until midday." "He may be released any time after that in the afternoon." CHAOS The hospital plunged into chaos ahead Tarique's expected release, as scores of party supporters crammed the hospital grounds, and at one point badly beat up a 'reformist' BNP leader. Chief political correspondent Suman Mahmud said from the scene that services at the hospital appeared to be on the verge of collapse as BNP supporters flocked to the hospital and nearby Shahbagh on the news that Tarique was to be released sometime in the afternoon. The rush disturbed patients and disrupted treatment, Mahmud quoted a BSMMU doctor as saying. "There's little space to move. We're having great difficulty," said the doctor, who preferred not to be named. As people chanted slogans for the release of Tarique and Khaleda, an angry mob of supporters assaulted 'reformist' party leader and former state minister for education Ehsanul Haque Milon, leaving him bloody and injured. Jatiyatabadi Jubo Dal general secretary Moazzem Hossain Alal and police went to his rescue. Jubo Dal president and a former state minister Barkatullah Bulu was also assaulted around the same time that DIG prisons Siddiqui arrived at the hospital. Other pro-reform leaders fled the scene in a hurry seeing the fate of Milon, Mahmud reported. ON TRIAL Joint forces arrested Tarique on March 8 last year at Dhaka Cantonment house. He was remanded in custody the same day in an extortion case filed by a contractor Amin Ahmed. As many as 16 cases have been filed against Tarique; one of them involving Daily Dinkal has been disposed of, while he has secured bail in 12 on-trial cases. Authorities are yet to press charges in three other cases. The High Court on August 25 granted him six months' interim bail in a Tk 1 crore extortion case and on August 26, another four months' bail in the Zia Orphanage Trust corruption case. Tarique got bail in five cases on August 27, of which three involved extortion charges, one on income tax dodge and another on illegally acquired assets. On August 28, when the Supreme Court granted him bail in the case involving the suppression of Sabbir murder for which Tarique allegedly took huge sums of money, he secured
