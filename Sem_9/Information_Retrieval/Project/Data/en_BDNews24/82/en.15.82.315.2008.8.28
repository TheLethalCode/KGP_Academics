 MILAN, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Inter Milan are struggling for central defenders for the start of their Italian title defence at Sampdoria on Saturday (1830 GMT). New Inter coach Jose Mourinho was forced to play midfielder Esteban Cambiasso at centre back in last weekend's win over AS Roma in the Super Cup and he may have to do so again in Genoa. Walter Samuel, Ivan Cordoba and Cristian Chivu have been working their way back to fitness after surgery while Marco Materazzi has been injured in pre-season. Nicolas Burdisso and Nelson Rivas suffered knocks in the Super Cup, with media reports saying Materazzi and Cordoba may therefore be risked despite a lack of match sharpness. Despite Inter's injury difficulties, Mourinho has already won over top striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic. "He is the most complete coach I have ever had, on the field and off it. You immediately see the difference with other coaches," Ibrahimovic told Gazzetta dello Sport. Milan, who host newly-promoted Bologna on Sunday (1300), have similar problems with centre backs Paolo Maldini, Kakha Kaladze and Alessandro Nesta all struggling for fitness. New arrival Philippe Senderos from Arsenal is also not expected to be fit for around 10 days because of a back problem. KAKA OUT Carlo Ancelotti has less to worry about upfront with only Brazilian playmaker Kaka and striker Marco Borriello definitely ruled out for the opening weeks of the season with knee trouble. Ancelotti will be itching to start forwards Ronaldinho and Andriy Shevchenko following their close-season arrivals. Juventus, widely expected to be in the title race this term alongside Inter and Milan, have fewer injury concerns for Sunday's trip to free-spending Fiorentina (1830). Defender Giorgio Chiellini is out for several weeks with a twisted knee but Juve, who like Fiorentina reached the Champions League proper this week, have an array of riches in attack. Coach Claudio Ranieri has the difficult task of choosing two forwards from Alessandro Del Piero, David Trezeguet, Vincenzo Iaquinta and new 23 million euro ($34 million) signing Amauri. His former club Palermo, who suffered an embarrassing Italian Cup exit to third division Ravenna last weekend, open the season with a trip to Udinese in Saturday's 1600 kick off. AS Roma, who pundits say will struggle to match last term's second place finish, entertain ambitious Napoli on Sunday (1300) with striker Francesco Totti out with ankle trouble
