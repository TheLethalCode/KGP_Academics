 Dhaka, Sept 1 (bdnews24.com)  India's most successful captain Sourav Ganguly may come in Dhaka after Eid-ul-Fitr to conduct a workshop for Bangladesh's age-group cricketers, said a Bangladesh Cricket Board official. "He has agreed to conduct a workshop on mental toughness in international cricket for the players of the National Cricket Academy," said BCB Game Development Committee chairman Shakil Kasem at a press conference on Monday. Selector Akram Khan announced a 15-member academy squad for the Sri Lanka tour for two four-dayers and three one-day matches this month. Explaining the reasons to choose Ganguly, Kasem said he was considered one of toughest guys mentally in the international cricket and was also a successful captain. The left-handed batsman has 6888 Test runs, including 15 centuries, and 11363 ODI runs with 22 hundreds. "Ganguly was supposed to come here last month before the academy team would leave for Sri Lanka on Sept 4, but he asked us to fix a suitable time," said Kasem. He added Ganguly was likely to come after the Eid. "Our players are not less skilled than other country's players, but they lack mental toughness and patience and to enhance these we are going to organise a workshop," said Kasem. He said they had a plan to send the Under-19 cricketers to the workshop and would not mind if any senior players join the workshop. Kasem said that they are now focusing on the players' fitness and diet so that the raising players could adopt themselves properly in the international arena. The Game Development Committee had earlier arranged talks for the academy players delivered by former national captains Habibul Bashar, Khaled Mashud, Khaled Mahmud and ace spinner Mohammedan Rafique. b
