<TITLE> HC questions legality of RPO 2008 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Thursday asked the government to explain why sections of the amended RPO concerning party constitutions and religion-based politics should not be declared unconstitutional. The bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Farid Ahmed made the ruling in line with a writ petition filed by Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mojaheed. The secretary to the president, law secretary and Chief Election Commissioner have been asked to respond to the rule within two weeks. The sections of the Representation of the People Order (Amendment) Ordinance 2008 highlighted by the High Court Thursday are those relating to banning religion-based politics, representation of women in party committees and constitution of political parties. The amended RPO says a political party will not qualify for registration if any discrimination regarding religion, race, caste, language or sex is apparent in its constitution, or if it threatens to destroy communal harmony or lead the country to territorial disintegration. The new law makes it mandatory for political parties to elect members of committees at all levels, including members of the central committee. It also enforces provisions in a party's constitution for fixing the goal of reserving at least 33 percent of all committee positions for women and successively achieving this goal by the year 2020. The petitioner's lawyer barrister Abdur Razzak told the court that the sections of the RPO were unconstitutional and the caretaker government was not entitled to issue such an ordinance. "A party will decide how many people in its committees should be women," the lawyer said. "Besides, the state cannot intervene in the constitution of a party. There is no such law in any civilised country in the world," he added. He said any party based on religion or ideology, including the Communist Party of Bangladesh, would not qualify for registration if the ordinance was put into force. The government published the ordinance amending the Representation of the People Order 1972 by gazette on Aug 19. The cabinet had originally approved in principle a new Representation of People Ordinance 2008 to replace the Representation of the People Order 1972, but went for amendment as the move to repeal the original RPO was strongly opposed by political parties. The amendments to the RPO were made in line with reform talks arranged by the Election Commission. The EC started electoral-reform work in February last year, including rounds of dialogue with political parties and with civil society members. bdnew
