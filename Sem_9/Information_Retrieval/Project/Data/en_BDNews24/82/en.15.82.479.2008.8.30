The 72 year-old playwright, who was initially taken to India's Tata Hospital in May after his cancer was detected, has been undergoing chemotherapy at City Hospital. Zia's younger brother Rashid Haider told bdnews24.com that his brother was between life and death. "The doctors are not optimist about his survival," he said.
