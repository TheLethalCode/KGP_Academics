 Dhaka, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court issued an arrest warrant against former caretaker adviser and Supreme Court judge Fazlul Huq on graft charges Wednesday. Dhaka metropolitan senior special Judge Md Azizul Haque made the order and set Sept 9 for the submission of the report on arrest to the court. Earlier, the documents of the case including the chargesheet were transferred from Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court. Anticorruption Commission assistant director and investigation officer of the case Mohammad Ibrahim submitted the charge sheet, applying for an arrest warrant and seeking permission to seize property, on Tuesday. Fazlul Huq, a former law and parliamentary affairs adviser in the immediate past caretaker government led by president Iajuddin Ahmed, has not been shown absconding in the case, the investigation officer said. The ACC has named 38 people as witnesses in the case filed on March 13 and accusing the former judge of amassing Tk 97.37 lakh through illegal means. The charge sheet submitted to the court Tuesday alleged the former adviser kept a large portion of his illegal income in bank accounts belonging his son and son-in-law. His son's friends were also accomplices. According to the investigation report, the ACC found a total of Tk 14 crore in the bank accounts of Huq's son Afzal Hossain Raj, son-in-law Tariqur Rahman Prince and Raj's friends. The ACC could not find any legal source for the money. A Dhaka court sentenced Prince to three years in prison on Aug 21 for not submitting a wealth statement to the Anticorruption Commission. Prince has been on the run since the ACC asked for his wealth statement. The sentence will be effective from the day of his surrender or arrest. Meanwhile, Dhanmondi police took three people into remand after they were arrested last Friday, on charges of receiving bribes from the former judge . Police said the three arrested had admitted taking Tk 24.50 lakh from Huq's family to help him evade graft charges by the ACC. bdnews24
