<TITLE> Egypt opens border with Gaza for two days </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Gaza,Aug 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Egypt opened its border crossing with the Gaza Strip on Saturday, allowing hundreds of people to leave the Hamas-controlled territory, Palestinian officials said. Egyptian security and border sources said the Rafah border crossing will remain open for two days to allow Gazans with foreign residence permits and humanitarian cases to cross into Egypt. Egypt closed the Rafah border crossing after Hamas Islamists seized the Gaza Strip more than a year ago, and hundreds of Egyptian citizens have been stuck in the coastal enclave. Some 100 people have crossed into Egypt and 200 Palestinians have returned home to Gaza, the Egyptian sources said. Palestinian officials said more than 500 Egyptians and Gazans with foreign residency permits have already crossed into Egypt and they expect hundreds more to follow. Hamas wants Egypt to permanently open Rafah to ease an Israel-led blockade, but under a US-brokered agreement signed in November 2005, they cannot do so without the consent of Israel and Hamas-rival Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas
