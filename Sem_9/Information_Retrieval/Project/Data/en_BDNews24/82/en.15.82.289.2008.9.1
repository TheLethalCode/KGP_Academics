<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Sept 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Third seed Novak Djokovic of Serbia survived a hard-hitting battle with Croatian teenager Marin Cilic on Sunday and said it was the sort of test needed to prepare him for another assault on the U.S. Open title. Australian Open winner Djokovic duelled for nearly four hours on Arthur Ashe Stadium court before claiming a 6-7 7-5 6-4 7-6 victory over the 30th seed to reach the round of 16. "It's always good in the early stages to have long matches, a little struggle," the Serbian world number three told reporters, noting a gruelling second-round, five-setter last year against Radek Stepanek on his way to a runner-up finish. "Now I'm motivated to go far." Djokovic had all he could handle against his 19-year-old opponent. Cilic had 19 aces and 12 double faults, and cracked 47 winners and 65 unforced errors in his go-for-broke style. The 21-year-old Serb said it was his mental toughness more than tactics that saved him. "It was more the fight, and the focus in I had in the end in that crucial fourth-set tiebreak," he said about registering a 7-0 knockout blow in the decider. "I managed to get myself together after the two match points he saved," Djokovic said referring to the 10th game of the fourth set. "I didn't feel good in that moment, that's for sure. I was mentally strong. For me, this match is extremely important mentally." Cilic was a difficult opponent for him on many levels. "Obviously he didn't have much to lose as a youngster, and he's on the road (to success). He won New Haven (just prior to the Open) and he won a couple of matches here and he was on the centre court for the first time. "Whenever I needed to serve it out, he was really stepping in. I played a bit too defensive. I was waiting for his mistakes, and I was wrong." Djokovic said going up against the young Croat and some of the other impressive newcomers making noise at the Open made him feel old, even at age 21. "I do feel a little old, like I played tennis all my life. But no, it's good for the sport to see new teenagers and rising stars coming up Cilic and (Juan Martin) Del Potro, and (Kei) Nishikori. "They're all (potential) top 10 players. I'm sure we're going to see them in the future.
