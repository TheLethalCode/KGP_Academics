 Dhaka, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam said on Friday the caretaker government and the Election Commission were the main obstacles to holding the general elections. "They took power with the promise of holding a free, fair and peaceful election. But the promise is now about to be broken," Ashraful said at a meeting in memory of late party leader Ivy Rahman at the National Press Club. Ashraful came down hard on the government on the issue of suspected corrupt people being freed from jails. "If a world champion, with up to 14 graft cases against him, can get released from jail, why should other prisoners stay behind bars?" He said it was not them rather the BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami and their allies who had reached a compromise deal with the government in the special jail in presence of Khaleda Zia, the detained former prime minister. Ashraful also criticised the BNP-led alliance government saying that it had made a farce with cases including Bangabandhu killing, Aug 21, 2004 grenade attacks at Bangabandhu Avenue, ex-finance minister Shah AMS Kibria killing and many others. "Today's BNP and JCD are the latest forms of the Muslim League and the NSF of the 60s'. Conspiracy is still on," he added. "The group that came to power after the assassination of Bangabandhu is the modern form of Pakistan Muslim League. And the present government follows that group," Ashraful said. He termed the anticorruption drive an eyewash. "The government was busy with a drive against the AL," he added. The AL leader asked all pro-liberation forces to unite to get justice. AL presidium member Motia Chowdhury said "People of the country will wait until December. Nobody can imagine what happens after that." Professor AAMS Arefin Siddique presided over the meeting. bdnews24.
