<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 1 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League has decided in principle to stage human-chain protests across the country to pressure authorities into dropping all charges against chief Sheikh Hasina and holding national elections first. The party's policymaking presidium, however, would finalise the schedule of the human chains, acting general secretary Syed Ashraful ISlam said. At the same time, the AL has demanded national elections by November as per the Election Commission roadmap. The decision came from a two-day meeting of the central working committee. The meeting ended at 2:30pm Monday at the Awami League president's political office. The meeting started at 11am Sunday, and at 1pm it was adjourned until 11am Monday. Ashraful also commented on the chief election commissioner's remarks. "Let the Election Commission perform its constitutional responsibility. It is not their duty to see which party participates in the election and which does not," he said. He said the AL-led 14-party alliance was alive and kicking and that his party would discuss with the allies before sitting with the EC. The Awami League acting general secretary also demanded withdrawal of all cases filed against the leaders of his party and its front organisations. "False cases have been filed against the leaders of our party. They have committed no crime. These cases have been filed as an act of political balancing." He said, "Sheikh Hasina must be freed and Awami League will go to election under her leadership." Demanding national election in November as per the roadmap he said, "We have no objection if the upazila election is held after national elections in November." Ashraful demanded immediate lifting of the state of emergency. "No election under the state of emergency will be acceptable nationally and internationally." The AL working committee meeting also demanded bringing the prices of essentials within the reach of the common people and ensuring uninterrupted power supply. bdnews24
