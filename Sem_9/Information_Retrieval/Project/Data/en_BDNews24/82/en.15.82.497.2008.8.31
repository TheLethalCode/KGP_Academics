 NEW YORK, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Top seed Rafael Nadal continued his merciless path through the U.S. Open draw on Saturday with a 6-4 6-3 6-0 third-round victory over Serbian Viktor Troicki. The world number one, champion at the French Open and Wimbledon this year but chasing his first Flushing Meadows title, trailed 3-1 in the second set but won 11 straight games to clinch another dominant win. Serving well, world number 71 Troicki caused Nadal plenty of problems early on but the Spaniard snatched a break in the 10th game to take the opening set. The Serbian caused a ripple of excitement when he broke on the way to a 3-1 lead in the second set. Nadal reacted by moving through the gears to roar home and set up a fourth-round battle with American Sam Querrey, who upset 14th seed Ivo Karlovic. After a tough start against German Bjorn Phau in the first round, Nadal has improved with each match and said that he is beginning to approach top form. "I am starting to play better," Nadal told reporters after clinching his 41st win in his past 42 matches. "Today I played better than the last days. I started playing well and today I served very well." Having added Olympic gold to his two grand slam titles this year, Nadal is the favourite to end Roger Federer's hopes of a fifth straight U.S. Open triumph. His later than usual arrival in New York, though, meant he has taken more time to find his feet. "The truth is that I was practising much better yesterday than the (first few) days," Nadal said. "I think I am ready to play a good match in the fourth round. I know I have to play a good match if I want to win.
