<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com)  The construction of the much awaited Padma Bridge will be complete by 2014-15, finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam forecast on Sunday. "The design for Padma Bridge is almost complete. Bids have been invited for appointment of a consultancy firm," the adviser told reporters after a meeting at the planning ministry. Mirza Aziz said the caretaker government had been trying to complete all necessary preparations to start construction before handing over power to an elected government. The World Bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Japan Bank of International Cooperation (JBIC) and Islamic Development Bank (IDB) will give a total of $1.15 billion in loan assistance (about Tk 8,000 crore) for financing the project. Mirza Aziz said the Asian Development Bank (ADB) would give the highest loan assistance. The ADB is also assisting on the design of the bridge. The total cost is estimated to be $1.6-1.8 billion (approximately Tk 11,000-12,500 crore) according to the communications ministry. The funding of the remaining Tk 3,000-3,500 crore from local sources was high on the agenda of Sunday's meeting. Mirza Azizul said three proposals on the matter were discussed in the meeting. "There is a proposal to collect the money by imposing surcharge or levies on bridge users. Another proposal is that the bridge be turned into a company and its shares issued in the capital market," the adviser said. The last proposal is that the government includes financing of the project in the Annual Development Programme, the adviser added. No final decision has been taken in this regard. A senior official of the communications ministry said the ADB and IDB would offer loans at 3.49 percent interest. The rate of interest on the World Bank and the JBIC loans is o.01 per cent, with service charges of 0.75 per cent. bdnews24.
