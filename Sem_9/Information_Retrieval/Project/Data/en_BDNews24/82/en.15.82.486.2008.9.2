<TITLE> Japan searches for a new prime minister, again </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Tokyo, Sep 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan began searching for a new prime minister on Tuesday after Yasuo Fukuda became the second leader to abruptly resign in less than a year, threatening a further policy vacuum as the economy teeters on the brink of recession. The frontrunner to become the 11th prime minister in 15 years is former foreign minister Taro Aso, 67, an outspoken nationalist popular with voters who was runner-up to Fukuda in the race for party chief last year. Markets took the sudden departure of Fukuda in their stride. Both the Nikkei stock average and government bond futures rose after initial wobbles, although analysts said Aso might try to spend Japan's way out of its economic woes. Aso said he thought he was a suitable candidate in a party vote, which Kyodo news agency said was expected on September 22. "I think (Fukuda) felt he had work that was left undone, and he said he wanted it to be carried out," Aso told a news conference. "As someone who discussed these issues with him, including the economic package, I think I have the credentials to take that on," said the veteran lawmaker, currently secretary-general in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)." Fukuda, 72, had been struggling to cope with a divided parliament where opposition parties have the power to delay legislation, and his sudden exit raised questions about his conservative party's ability to cling to power or even hold together after ruling Japan for most of the past 53 years. The bespectacled Fukuda, a moderate conservative who favors close ties with Japan's Asian neighbors, only took office last September after his predecessor, Shinzo Abe, similarly quit after just a year in office. Fukuda's resignation does not automatically mean an early election, ahead of the due date of September next year. However, whoever the LDP picks as its leader, and thus the next prime minister, might choose an early poll to take advantage of any rise in public support. A complete deadlock in parliament could also force the prime minister to call an election reluctantly. The ruling coalition is almost certain to lose seats, if not its majority, but voters say they want a turn to pick their government. "As two LDP prime ministers resigned in a row, I think it is necessary to call a general election within this year," said Chika Hasegawa, 45, a patent agency employee. "The LDP is now in tatters, why not let the Democratic Party take charge and see how it goes." The main opposition Democratic Party has made no secret of its desire to oust the LDP and its junior coalition partner, the New Komeito. If the LDP goes past the outspoken Aso again, other potential leadership contenders are Economics Minister Kaoru Yosano, known for his commitment to fixing Japan's tattered finances, and conservative Yuriko Koike, who was briefly last year the country's first female defence minister. Popular female lawmaker Seiko Noda, currently the minister in charge of consumer affairs, has also been mentioned by the media as a possible successor to freshen up the LDP's image. While they initially shrugged off the now familiar scenario of no national leader, market analysts said Japan's stock and bond markets would likely sag after Fukuda's departure, which is expected to cloud the reform outlook and potentially spur debt-funded spending. Analysts said the next LDP prime minister would face similar woes given the parliamentary deadlock and the party's rusting political machine and scandal-tainted image. Talk of a broad realignment of party alliances has been simmering since the opposition took control of the upper house last year, but it remains to be seem if early moves pick up steam.
