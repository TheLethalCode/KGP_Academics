The region has suffered hundreds of smaller but still serious quakes since then. Saturday's quake injured 467 people and forced 152,000 to flee. Over 250,000 homes were damaged, Xinhua said. The US Geological Survey put the magnitude of the quake at 5.7, while Xinhua said it measured 6.1.

The government was rushing disaster relief to the affected areas, including thousands of tents and blankets.
