 NEW YORK, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World number one Rafael Nadal said he hoped he had gotten his "bad day" out of the way at the U.S. Open, and was happy to reach the quarter-finals at Flushing Meadows on Monday. Nadal, winner of Olympic gold in Beijing, is aiming to end arch rival Roger Federer's run of four straight triumphs at the U.S. Open. The Swiss player may have taken heart from Nadal's less than perfect performance in the fourth round. French Open and Wimbledon champion Nadal defeated American Sam Querrey 6-2 5-7 7-6 6-3, but struggled at times, double faulting at important moments and proving erratic on his usually trusty, killer forehand. "In every tournament you have one bad day, that's the normal thing," Nadal told reporters. "When you are playing not your best, the important thing is to win. I did today." Nadal's tally of unforced errors was unusually high at 41, and his six double faults outnumbered his five aces. But he said he was pleased to have pulled out his best shots during the third-set tiebeaker, which he won 7-2. The 22-year-old Spaniard will next meet another American, Mardy Fish, who reached his first U.S. Open quarter-finals by defeating French 32nd seed Gael Monfils. Fish defeated fellow American James Blake in the previous round and Nadal said he would be a dangerous opponent, with a big serve, and a good backhand and volley. "Probably I am not in the freshest moment in my life, but I am fine," said Nadal, who has won 42 of his last 43 matches in a hectic schedule. "The important thing is I am there. I am in the quarter-finals. I have a tough match against Fish. I have to play my best for the last part of the tournament." Querrey, who played a string of winners on his forehand and belted 20 aces against Nadal, advised his compatriot to take the game to Nadal. "If he's aggressive and comes in at the right times, especially on Nadal's backhand, I think he could have a shot," Querrey told reporters. "He's got to be aggressive and take chances. He can't go baseline to baseline with Rafa." Querrey said he had been beset with nerves in the first set, fearing at one point he faced a three-set drubbing. "I felt like I played well and it was a good week," he said. "Not the worst thing in the world, going out to the number one guy.
