 Dhaka, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com)  Middle-order batsman Roqibul Hasan injured his right thumb during the three-ODI opener against Australia in Darwin on Saturday. Roqibul was struck in the gloves by a Brett Geeves delivery that had got him out and fractured his right thumb, according to Sunday's report filed by tigercricket.com, the official website of the Bangladesh Cricket Board. "Roqibul was seen by a doctor on Saturday afternoon and had his X-ray done Sunday morning," read the report adding that the X-ray had revealed a 'comminuted' fracture. "The batsman will be examined by an orthopedic surgeon Monday morning before a decision is made on his condition," it said. Bangladesh hit new batting low to get skittled out for 74 in 27.4 after Australia scored 254 for eight, two runs less than their previous lowest ODI total of 76 against Sri Lanka and India in 2002 and 2003. Bangladesh play their second match against the hosts Wednesday. b
