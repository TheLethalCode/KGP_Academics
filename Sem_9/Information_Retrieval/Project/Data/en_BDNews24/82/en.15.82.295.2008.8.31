 NEW YORK, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kei Nishikori stunned fourth seed David Ferrer 6-4 6-4 3-6 2-6 7-5 on Saturday to become the first Japanese man to reach the last 16 of the U.S. Open in more than 70 years. Spaniard Ferrer, who reached the semi-finals last year, hit back from two sets down to force a decider but world number 126 Nishikori held his nerve to clinch victory after three hours, 32 minutes. "Right now I am very happy, that's the only word I can say now," an exhausted Nishikori, 18, told reporters. "I am really tired, my ankle, legs and back are sore and everything is hurting now." Nishikori said he had struggled to get through the match, having first started to cramp up in the third set. "He was starting to play great in the third and fourth sets and I was tired, my legs were almost cramping," he said. "But I tried to think 'I am playing David, he is the number four in the world and I am playing five sets with him'. I felt kind of happy (after that) and was thinking more positively. That's why I think I could fight through." The 18-year-old Nishikori used his big forehand and excellent variety to force Ferrer into a series of unusual errors as he won the first two sets. Ferrer looked the likelier winner after taking the next two but Nishikori broke in the fourth game of the decider and held the advantage to 5-3. But just when he looked down and out, Ferrer produced a rasping backhand pass to save match point and went on to break back for 5-4 and then hold for 5-5. Digging deep, Nishikori held serve to lead again and forced a second match point at 6-5, but Ferrer again shut the door, this time with a big serve. Nishikori was not to be denied, though, and after forcing a third match point he unleashed a forehand winner to clinch victory, falling to the court in delight and exhaustion. In addition to being the first Japanese man since 1937 to reach the last 16, Nishikori is also the youngest man to reach the fourth round at Flushing Meadows since Russian Marat Safin in 1998. Should he go on to beat Argentine 17th seed Juan Martin Del Potro, Nishikori would emulate Shuzo Matsuoka, who reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon in 1995, the only Japanese man to make the last eight of a grand slam event. "I don't think about making history, but I know Shuzo made quarters in Wimbledon. I'm very proud of it," Nishikori said. Ferrer said he had been beaten fair and square. "Nishikori is a very good player, a young player, and he served very well," he said. "I made too many mistakes on my forehand but I fought a lot. Nishikori played better than me I think.
