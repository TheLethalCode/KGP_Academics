 Dhaka, Sept 1 (bdnews24.com)  The Truth and Accountability Commission (TAC) on Monday started hearing cases at its Hare Road office. "Statements of seven persons in four cases are being heard. Of the seven three are couples. Two couples were heard until 4pm. Statements of the others are also being heard today (Monday)," Zahid Hossain, personal secretary to TAC chairman Justice Habibur Rahman Khan, told bdnews24.com. The mercy commission, as stipulated by law, is not disclosing the names of those being heard. Deputy secretary of the commission Shamim Al Mamun said the verdict of the cases would be conveyed to the persons concerned as soon as possible. Replying to a question he said there were retired government officials and officials of autonomous bodies among those whose cases were heard on the first day but there was no political figures among them . TAC chairman Justice Habibur Rahman Khan and members Maj Gen (retd) Manzur Rashid Khan and Asif Ali heard those who came to confess their crimes on Monday. Leaving the commission office after the hearings, those seeking clemency hid their faces from TV cameras. Men used files or other papers, while the women used scarves or saris to hide their faces. Others used the alternative door behind the commission office to avoid TV cameras altogether. The hearing started in the morning with a former Sylhet City Corporation official and his wife. Journalists waiting outside the commission office saw him enter the office at 10:30am after he was brought from Dhaka Central Jail. The former official was driven back to jail after the hearing of the couple ended at 1:45pm. President Iajuddin Ahmed signed the "Voluntary Divulgence of Information Ordinance 2008" into law on June 8, paving way for the commission to come into being. According to the ordinance, anybody facing conviction in a corruption case of two years or less can seek clemency from the commission by admitting to their crime and return within a specific time the wealth earned through corruption. The High Court on Aug 28 ordered the government to explain in two weeks why the "Voluntary Divulgence of Information Ordinance 2008" would not be declared unconstitutional and illegal, on a writ petition challenging the ordinance. bdnews24.com
