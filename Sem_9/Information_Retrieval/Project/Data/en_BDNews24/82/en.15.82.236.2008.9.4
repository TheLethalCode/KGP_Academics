 Dhaka, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com)  The High court on Thursday granted former caretaker adviser and Supreme Court judge Fazlul Huq a three-month bail in a graft case. The vacation bench of justices AFM Abdur Rahman and AM Emdadul Haque bailed him after the former judge turned himself in to the court. Earlier, the bench of justices Jinat Ara and Syed Mohammad Ziaul Karim refused to hear his bail appeal. Huq later told bdnews24.com that he was happy with the verdict. "The order has proved the victory of law. I did not commit any crime or corruption," he said. "The High Court order has proved that the case has been filed against me with an ill motive, because it was said that the incident took place on Nov 26 last year, but the case was filed on Apr 13 this year." "Had I gone to trial court I would have ordered straight into jail. That's why I have come to the High Court to get bail," Huq said. On allegations that he had paid three men Tk 24 lakh through his son to duck ACC charges, he said: "I have paid my income taxes. I don't have enough money left after that. Where will I get the money from? The charges were brought against me to stir a chaos." "There is no such example of harassing an Appellate Division judge this way. I would resign as soon as such allegations were brought during my service," the former judge said. Advocate Helal Uddin Mollah, Huq's lawyer, told bdnews24.com that considering his previous positions and age the court granted him bail. The court also asked Huq to submit his bail order to the lower court. The Dhaka Metropolitan Senior Special Judge's Court on Wednesday issued an arrest warrant against him on graft charges. Earlier, the documents of the case including the charge-sheet were transferred from Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court. Anticorruption Commission assistant director, also investigation officer of the case, Mohammad Ibrahim pressed charges against him on Tuesday. The ACC official also appealed to the court to order Huq's arrest and attachment of his property. Huq, a former law, justice and parliamentary affairs adviser in the immediate past caretaker government led by President Iajuddin Ahmed, has not been shown absconding in the case, the investigation officer said. The ACC has named 38 people as witnesses in the case filed on March 13 and accusing the former judge of amassing Tk 97.37 lakh beyond declared income. The charge sheet submitted to the court Tuesday alleged the former adviser kept a large portion of his illegal income in bank accounts belonging to his son and son-in-law. His son's friends were also accomplices. According to the investigation report, the ACC found a total of Tk 14 crore in the bank accounts of Huq's son Afzal Hossain Raj, son-in-law Tariqur Rahman Prince and Raj's friends. The ACC could not find any legal source for the money. A Dhaka court sentenced Prince to three years in prison on Aug 21 for not submitting a wealth statement to the Anticorruption Commission. Prince has been on the run since the ACC asked for his wealth statement. The sentence will be effective from the day of his surrender or arrest. Dhanmondi police last Friday took three people into remand after they were arrested on charges of receiving bribes from the former judge. Police said the arrestees had admitted taking Tk 24.50 lakh from Huq's family to help him evade graft charges. bdne
