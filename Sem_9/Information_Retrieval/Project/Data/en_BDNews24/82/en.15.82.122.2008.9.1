 Dhaka, Sept 1 (bdnews24.com)Rising floodwaters may climb slightly higher in sixteen districts over the next couple of days, but the overall flood situation in the country is not expected to assume dire proportions, the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre said Monday. FFWC assistant engineer Md Ariful Islam told bdnews24.com that after registering a further rise over the next one or two days, water levels in the rivers were expected to gradually recede. Rivers were still in spate up to Monday noon in Kurigram, Gaibandha, Dinajpur, Dinajpur, Tangail, Bogra, Jamalpur, Sirajganj, Munshiganj, Madaripur, Manikganj, Faridpur, Shariatpur, Chapainawabganj, Shibganj, Dhaka's eastern areas and Dohar and Nawabganj upazilas. The low lying regions in these districts might experience some further flooding with rivers flowing above the danger levels at places, but the situation will improve in a day or two, the flood forecast said. Of the 73 FFWC water level monitoring stations sited across the country, river waters at 20 points have so far been measured to be flowing above the red mark. Waters have risen at 39 stations in all, 29 stations have recorded falls in water levels and the status read unchanged at three stations. bdnews
