 Baghdad, Sep 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States will begin handing over control to the Iraqi government in October of largely Sunni Muslim local guard units credited with helping contain bloodshed across Iraq. Yet doubts remain about how the Shi'ite-led government of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki will treat the unofficial forces, known as "Awakening Councils," that some officials see as a grave threat. The Iraqi government will take over payment in October of the 54,000 members of the neighborhood units that operate checkpoints and patrol streets in and around Baghdad, U.S. Lieutenant Colonel Jeffrey Kulmayer said in an interview. It will mark the first major step in a delicate transition that U.S. officials hope will ultimately see 20 percent of the U.S.-backed units incorporated into Iraqi security forces. Many in the armed units "were former insurgents, and that's why we call this a reconciliation issue", said Kulmayer, who will oversee the transfer of Awakening units to Iraqi control. "It's important that they're now included in the new Iraq." Under the U.S. and Iraqi plan, those who don't join Iraqi security forces will be given civilian jobs. The 99,000 members of the units, also known as 'Sons of Iraq', are credited with playing a key role in the sharp drop in violence across Iraq since they sprang up as a grassroots response to al Qaeda in western Anbar province in late 2006. Some Iraqi officials have been wary of the units, cautioning weapons must ultimately remain in the hands of the state alone. U.S. officials had been hoping to hand over of all the Awakening units by June 2009, but the Maliki government now wants to take control more quickly, Kulmayer said. At the same time, U.S. officials voice frustration about the plodding pace the units are being brought into security forces. The Maliki government "has their reasons for moving more slowly than the coalition would like to see," a senior Pentagon intelligence official in Baghdad said on condition of anonymity. DUBIOUS ALLEGIANCE Some Iraqi officials, beyond fears that former insurgents could infiltrate the Iraqi police, are loathe to accept one-time enemies whose government allegiance they see as dubious. The units are also widely seen as posing a sectarian threat to Maliki's Shi'ite-dominated Interior Ministry and police. "A lot of this is about political power," said Colin Kahl, an Iraq specialist at Georgetown University. "The question becomes, 'how much confidence do we have that the Iraqi government is going to do right by a bunch of guys it hates?'" U.S. and Iraqi officials deny that the government has a sectarian agenda against Awakening units. But there has been a rash of arrests of Awakening leaders -- a trend Kulmayer described as "very important and sensitive". "There are some who will not forget nor forgive that some sons of Iraq were insurgents," Kulmayer said. "It will take positive leadership from the prime minister, his government, the army and police to implement a transition that achieves reconciliation." Tahseen al-Sheikhly, Baghdad security spokesman, said no random arrests of Awakening members had taken place. "We appreciate and respect them because they have a sense of responsibility toward their communities," he said. Many other Awakening patrols have been targeted in suicide attacks, a tactic used by al Qaeda, and other violence. Some 430 Awakening members have been killed this year, Kulmayer said, but attacks are dropping in step with violence across the country. The Pentagon official said stabilizing security conditions should discourage former insurgents from switching sides anew. "There's always the chance that some of these former militia members could go back," he said, "but as they see improvements in their life, a great majority of them see a much better alternative than going back to arms."
