 Dhaka, Sept 1 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court on Monday deferred witness deposition for the third time in a Tk 3 crore extortion case against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and others. Judge Md Ashraf Hossain of Special Sessions Judge's Court-5 set Sept 8 for providing copies of a higher court ruling in the case. Earlier, the High Court bench of justices Khademul Islam Chowdhury and Mashuk Hossain Ahmed ordered the government to explain in six weeks. Why the case would not be declared illegal. The defence lawyers seeking deferment of proceedings said to the court: "A writ petition has been filed with the higher court in the case and the higher court ruled upon the government in this connection." "We, therefore, would request deferment of the case proceedings in this court until the higher court's disposal." Opposing the defence move, the prosecution lawyers said as the High Court had not stayed the case and only ruled upon the government, the trial should go ahead. The court under the circumstances ordered the defence lawyers to submit copy of the higher court's ruling on Sept 8. Plaintiff Azam J Chowdhury and Hasina's cousin former minister Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, another accused in the case, were present in the court. Earlier on August 26, witness deposition could not be carried out as the plaintiff was not present. Businessman Chowdhury filed the case with Gulshan police on June 13 last year. Later charges were also pressed against Hasina's sister Sheikh Rehana. Chowdury, however, denied having named Hasina in the case that says while the Awami League was in power the accused persons took Tk 2.99 crore in bribes from the litigant at different times in 2001 in exchange for landing the work of setting up Siddhirganj power station project. Hasina was arrested on July 16 last year and was shown arrested in the case, the same day, after the case was brought under the emergency powers rules. The government released Hasina from detention for eight weeks on June 11. She is currently in the US seeking medical treatment. bdne
