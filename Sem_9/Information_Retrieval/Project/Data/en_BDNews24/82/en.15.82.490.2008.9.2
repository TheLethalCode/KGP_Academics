<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Seventh seed Venus Williams set up a quarter-final against her sister Serena at the U.S. Open after she eased past Polish ninth seed Agnieszka Radwanska 6-1 6-3 on Monday. The Wimbledon champion roared through the first set and staved off a mini-fightback by Radwanska in the second to reach the quarter-finals for the ninth time. Coming forward at every opportunity, Williams overpowered a hapless Radwanska early on, smashing 14 winners on her way to the first set. Radwanska lifted her game to get a foothold in the second set, recovering an early break to level at 3-3, but Williams saved a break point in the eighth game and then broke again for victory. "She raised the level of her game, started trying to attack more, move in, playing more aggressive shots; that was smart of her," Williams said of Radwanksa's second-set showing. "She had some opportunities, but fortunately I was able to get them right back." Fourth seed Serena Williams beat unseeded Severine Bremond of France 6-2 6-2
