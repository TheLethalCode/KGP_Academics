 Dhaka, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com)  A metropolitan session judge deferred charge framing in the Aug 21 2004 grenade attack case to Sept 8, following the unusual behaviour of an accused in the dock on Sunday. Dhaka metropolitan 2nd additional session judge KM Rasheduzzaman ordered a medical check-up and treatment for the accused Ujjal Hossain in line with an appeal of his lawyer. Ujjal, standing in the dock, suddenly lay on the floor and began shouting: "I know nothing. Save me." His defence lawyer told the court that Ujjal had lost his balance and fallen because he was tortured in custody to give a confessional statement. The court ordered that the medical report be submitted to the court on the next hearing date of Sept 8. Former deputy minister for education Abdus Salam Pintu was among those arrested in the case on Ujjal's confessional statement. Pintu's lawyer requested the court to dispose of two cases relating to the incident simultaneously. The court refused. Thirteen out of 22 people accused in the case, including Pintu and Harkatul Jihad chief Mufti Abdul Hannan, were produced for Sunday's hearing from different jails. Accused Shahadatullah Jewel who is on bail was represented in court by his lawyer. The remaining eight accused are fugitives. Metropolitan sessions judge Azizul Huq fixed Sept 21 for publishing a notice in daily newspapers asking fugitives in the case to appear in court. bdnews24.
