 Dhaka, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com)  The Truth and Accountability Commission continued hearing cases for a second day on Tuesday with the statements of two couples in two cases at its Hare Road office. "Statements of two couples in two cases were heard today. Statements of six persons will be heard Wednesday, including officials of Chittagong port and the forest department," Zahid Hossain, private secretary to TAC chairman Justice Habibur Rahman Khan, told bdnews24.com. The commission heard statements of seven persons in four cases on its first day of hearings. As stipulated by law, it is not disclosing the names of those being heard. Tuesday's hearings began in the morning with two engineers of Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authorities. Their wives were also present there. President Iajuddin Ahmed signed the "Voluntary Divulgence of Information Ordinance 2008" into law on June 8, paving way for the commission to come into being. According to the ordinance, anybody facing conviction in a corruption case of two years or less can seek clemency from the commission by admitting to their crime and return within a specific time the wealth earned through corruption. The High Court on Aug 28 ordered the government to explain in two weeks why the "Voluntary Divulgence of Information Ordinance 2008" would not be declared unconstitutional and illegal, on a writ petition challenging the ordinance. bdnew
