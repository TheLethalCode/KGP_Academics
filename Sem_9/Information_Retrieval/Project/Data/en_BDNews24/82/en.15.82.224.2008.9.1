 Dhaka, Sept 1 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Cricket Board Monday announced a 15-member Grameenphone-BCB Academy squad for a three-week tour of Sri Lanka this month. "The Sri Lanka-bound squad is stronger compared to the squad that toured South Africa a few days ago as some of A team players have joined the squad," selector Akram Khan told reporters during the announcement of the squad at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Naeem Islam, Sajidul Islam, Arafat Sunny, Rubel Hossain and wicketkeeper Ashiqul Islam Rajib have been included in the squad while five players -- Nadif Chowdhury, Jahurul Islam, Raihanuddin, Sahagir Hossain Pavel and Shafaq Al Zabir  have been dropped from the side. The GP-BCB Academy side, which toured South Africa last month, will face Sri Lankan counterparts in three one-day matches after playing two four-dayers against Sri Lanka Development squad as well as a warm-up two-day match. The academy team will leave here for Colombo on Sept 4. "The academy's tour of South Africa was reasonably a success as the boys drew the four-dayer series with 1-1, and won one-day match and went close to other two one-day matches," said Shakil Kasem, the chairman of the BCB Games Development Committee. The former national cricketer hoped that the academy boys would continue their performance also in Sri Lanka. Naeem and Marshall have been named captain and vice captain respectively though Suhrawardi Shuvo captained the academy team in South Africa.
