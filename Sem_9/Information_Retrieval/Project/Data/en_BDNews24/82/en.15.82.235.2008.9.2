<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has ordered the government and the Election Commission to explain why barring teachers, of MPO educational establishments, from contesting elections should not be declared illegal and unconstitutional. The chief adviser, the chief election commissioner, the president's secretary, cabinet secretary and law secretary have been asked to reply to the rule nisi within two weeks. A HC bench of justices Mirza Hossain Haider and Mamnun Rahman passed the order Tuesday on a writ petition filed by Rajshahi Ideal Degree College lecturer and former ward commissioner Abdus Samad. Tajul Islam, the petitioner's lawyer, told the hearing that three ordinances, regarding local government polls to city corporations, municipalities and upazilas, barred teachers of non government educational institutes on monthly payment orders from applying for candidacy in those elections. "The election seeks honest and qualified candidates. Teachers have theses qualities," Islam said. "How can the commission ensure the participation of good candidates if the teachers' candidacy is banned by the ordinances?" he asked. He added that the caretaker government could not take any decision out of line with the constitution. "The provision should be scrapped." Deputy attorney general Afsar Jahan Ila represented the state. Abdus Samad filed the writ petition on Sunday. bdnew
