 Dhaka, Sept 1 (bdnews24.com)  Home adviser MA Matin on Monday said the home ministry had received no file on the release of detained former prime minister Khaleda Zia and elder son Tarique Rahman. Asked if the parole of Awami League general secretary Abdul Jalil would be extended the home adviser said, "I have to consult law before saying anything on this issue." Jalil returned home Sunday night after undergoing treatment in Singapore for about six months. He was arrested on May 28 last year. Authorities released him on two months' parole on March 2 after he had fallen ill in detention. The parole was extended several times later. On Khaleda's release, Matin on August 14 said, "The file will come to the home ministry after completion of the legal process. Then the home ministry will make a decision on her release." Tarique has recently been granted bail by the High Court in all 13 cases he stands trial in. After the bail in the last case last week Tarique's lawyers and jail authorities said he would be freed as soon as the bail papers reach jail authorities. The Supreme Court on Monday rejected the government and the Anticorruption Commission's appeal for a freeze on bails in six cases and asked them to appeal in the regular bench. Education and commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said on Sunday the government would contest the bail orders. "It is a legal process. Law has a pace of its own. Everything is progressing accordingly." The High Court has granted bail to Khaleda, the BNP chief, two of the four cases and halted proceedings of other two cases. The chief adviser and a number of his colleagues have been saying for sometime that the process of her release is going on. Khaleda was arrested in a corruption case on Sept 3, 2007 and Tarique was detained on March 8 that year. Her younger son Arafat Rahman Coco is now on parole in Thailand for treatment. bdnews24.com
