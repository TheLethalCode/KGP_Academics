<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 1 (bdnews24.com)  Middle-order batsman Roqibul Hasan has been ruled out of the remaining two one-dayers against Australia following his fractured right thumb. The batsman injured his right thumb while batting Australia in the series opener on Saturday. "Roqibul was examined by an orthopedic surgeon in Darwin Monday afternoon. The specialist concluded that the injury does not require a surgery, but the thumb will have to be kept in a splint for four to six weeks for it to heal," said a Bangladesh Cricket Board press release Monday. Selector Naimur Rahman Durjoy said that they would not send any replacement. Roqibul will stay back in Australia and return home with the rest of the squad on 07 September.
