<TEXT>
 Brahmanbaria, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com)  Bikalpadhara Bangladesh president AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury has said political parties need more time beyond the Oct 15 deadline to register with the Election Commission. He also said he believed Upazila elections had better be held before the parliamentary polls. "Registration is necessary. But it is not possible within the deadline fixed by the Election Commission. More time has to be set aside," Badruddoza said at an organisational training programme of his party's Nabinagar Upazila unit in Brahmanbaria on Friday. "No political party held Upazila or Zila Parishad elections in the last 16 years. So, the people now don't trust the political parties. Holding Upazila elections before the Jatiya Sangsad elections under the present caretaker government is necessary." The former president asked the government to start trying war criminals, saying Jamaat-e-Islami opposed independence, and aided and abetted the Pakistani aggressors. bdnews24.
