 Dhaka, Sept 1 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court on Monday rejected the appeals of the government and the Anticorruption Commission to halt the High Court bail orders to Tarique Rahman in six cases. Chamber judge Justice Joynul Abedin of a vacation bench asked the government and the ACC to file regular appeals against the orders. Tarique's lawyer barrister Rafiqul Islam Mia later told reporters that there were no other legal barriers to the release of the elder son of former prime minister Khaleda Zia from detention. Appeals against Tarique's bails in a Tk 1 crore extortion case, Zia Orphanage Trust case and ill-gotten wealth case were also filed on Sunday. Attorney general Salahuddin Ahmed stood for the government and advocate Annisul Haque for the ACC ones. Salahuddin argued that Tarique could be granted bail on medical grounds had he not been provided with proper medical treatment. The attorney general said Tarique did not need bail as he was being given the best treatment available in Bangladesh. Tarique's lawyer AJ Mohammad Ali questioned the government's motive behind the appeal against the High Court orders after so many days. The High Court granted him bail in the case on Aug 25. The attorney general told the court that Tarique might go abroad if his bail was not stayed. The court said Tarique had not been given permission to go abroad. Advocate Annisul Haque defended the ACC appeals in Zia Orphanage Trust case and the ill-gotten wealth case. The court issued similar rulings on the appeals. The attorney general then appealed for a freeze on Tarique's bail orders in three other extortion cases but the court rejected the petitions. Barrister Rafiqul Islam Mia hoped Tarique would be freed within 24 hours. The High Court granted Tarique Rahman six months' bail in Tk 1 crore extortion case. The BNP senior joint secretary general secured four months' bail in Zia Orphanage Trust case on Aug 26. The following day, he was granted bail in a total of five cases including the extortion case, a tax evasion case and the ACC case on earning wealth beyond declared income. On Aug 28, the Supreme Court granted bail to Tarique in a bribery case linked to the murder of Basundhara director Humayun Kabir Sabbir. bdnews24
