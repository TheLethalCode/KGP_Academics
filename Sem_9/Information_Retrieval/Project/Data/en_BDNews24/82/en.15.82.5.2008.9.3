 BANGKOK, Wed Sep 3,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A strike by public sector unions to pile more pressure on Thailand's prime minister had little impact on daily life in Bangkok on Wednesday, a day after emergency rule was imposed to quash anti-government protests. Electricity and water supplies flowed despite a threat by unions to cut off services to government offices and disrupt transport in the sprawling city of 10 million people. The leaders of 43 unions representing 200,000 workers launched the strikes to support a three-month-old street campaign to force Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej from power. Samak, who has refused to bow to protesters occupying his official compound for nine days, invoked a state of emergency in Bangkok on Tuesday after clashes between his supporters and anti-government protesters killed one man and injured 45. Thailand's biggest power producer, EGAT, said it was business as usual at its power plants as most staff showed up for work. Bus routes were operating as normal, as well as the city's skytrain and underground subway. Outer city rail lines were operating at 75 percent, rail officials said. The city's notorious gridlock was lighter than usual as some residents opted to stay at home, as did pupils from hundreds of government primary schools. Bangkok's main Suvarnabhumi airport remained open, but flights to the southern city of Hat Yai were disrupted for a second day after protesters blocked roads to the airfield. Tour companies have reported cancellations since the protests intensified last week, hurting a tourism sector that generates the equivalent of 6 percent of GDP and is a major employer. POLICE POWERS Army chief Anupong Paochinda's refusal to use force to evict thousands of protesters at Government House, despite a decree that banned public gatherings and gave his soldiers police powers, has annoyed the government. "He is in neutral gear," a senior government source said. "The government doesn't wholeheartedly believe the military would not interfere in politics. They are always looking for reasons to stage a coup," the source said. Anupong, among the generals who ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra in 2006 only to see Thaksin's allies return to power in Samak's six-party coalition government, has said repeatedly a coup cannot solve Thailand's political problems. The People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) -- a motley coalition of businessmen, academics and activists who accuse Samak of being an illegitimate proxy of Thaksin -- have vowed to stay at Government House until Samak steps down. The crisis has distracted the government at a time when the country faces slowing growth and high inflation, prompting exasperated investors to park their money elsewhere. The baht was at 34.43 per dollar after hitting a one-year low of 34.52 on Tuesday after the emergency was invoked. The main stock index fell nearly one percent on Wednesday and is down 25 percent since the protests began in May. "Most analysts expect further near-term volatility as the situation on the ground is still not normal and is negative to the market," Siam City Securities senior analyst Apisak Limthamrongkul said. Some analysts believe Samak could call a snap election as a last resort, despite his recent refusal to dissolve parliament. The legislative body began debate on a new, $53 billion national budget on Wednesday. It would replenish government coffers for an election campaign, which Samak's allies are almost certain to win on the back of strong support in the countryside. Sondhi Limthongkul, a PAD leader who led a similar street campaign against Thaksin, laid out his group's latest demands in an interview with the Bangkok Post newspaper. "They must accept the four-point demand, and only if the prime minister is either Somchai Wongsawat or Surapong Suebwonglee," he said, referring to Samak's education minister and finance minister respectively. A PAD spokesman later clarified that Sondhi would accept anyone as an interim leader as long as Samak left. The government source said there would be no talks with the PAD until they abandoned Government House. The PAD wants the government to drop its bid to amend the constitution; halt large infrastructure projects; commit to political reform; and accept a Thai court ruling in a dispute with Cambodia over an ancient temple
