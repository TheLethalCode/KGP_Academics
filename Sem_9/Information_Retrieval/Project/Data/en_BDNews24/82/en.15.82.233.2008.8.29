<TEXT>
 Bogra, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com)  Asadullah Al Ghalib, alleged militant kingpin and Ahle Hadith Andolon, Bangladesh (AHAB) chief, was released on bail from Bogra jail on Thursday. Bogra district superintendent of police Abdur Razzak told reporters Ghalib had got bails in four of five in cases, the latest in a bombing case in Bogra on Aug 25. But his release was delayed as the papers of cancellation of a court order summoning him in a case in Dhaka did not reach jail authorities, he added. Razzak said authorities released him around 5:30pm after scrutinising the bail papers. Jamaat-ul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) leader Shafiqullah, a resident of Narayanganj who was arrested on charges of involvement in the killing of one person at a drama stage at Lakkhikhola, Shahjahanpur in Bogra on January 14, 2004, acknowledged in the court of Ghalib's involvement in militant activities. Police submitted charge sheets to the court on charges of involvement in the bomb attack against the then JMB chief Shaykh Abdur Rahman, member Shafiqullah and his patrons Joynal and Ghalib. Rajshahi city general secretary of AHAB Maulana Shamsul Alam said Ghalib was arrested in Rajshahi on February 22, 2005 on charges of involvement with militant activities. A total of 10 cases have been filed against Galib, but with accusations not proved, the police dropped charges in four cases. A Rajshahi University teacher, Ghalib has been acquitted of charges in another case and granted bail in five other cases in which charges have been pressed against him. When reporters tried to approach Ghalib for comments, they were told by AHAB workers that he had been sick. Shamsul Alam said, "We are victims of political vengeance. Lately Ghalib got bail and acquitted in some cases. We're respectful of the judiciary." Galib's lawyer AHM Golam Rabbani Khan Roman said, "No witness uttered his name. Neither did they say that they knew him." bdnews
