<TEXT>
 Khulna, September 1 (bdnews24.com)A Khulna court Monday acquitted four people of the charges of murdering Awami League leader Manzurul Imam. Judge Abdus Salam Sikdar, of the Khulna divisional speedy trial court, handed down the verdict in the triple murder case, involving the deaths of two others as well as the AL leader. Acquitting Abdul Rabbi Ripon, Ganesh Banerjee, Shahadat Hossain and Shukur Ali Gazi, the judge mentioned, however, that trial of the case had suffered due to the frequent changes of investigation officers. The public prosecutor, family of the murdered and AL leaders expressed dissatisfaction over the verdict on Monday. PP Abu Jafar told reporters after the judgment that the government would file an appeal in the higher court challenging the verdict. "We haven't been treated justly," the slain AL leader's son Abdullah Harun Rumi said. Khulna City Corporation mayor Talukdar Abdul Khaleque echoed: "We haven't received justice." Khulna metropolitan AL president Manjurul Imam was killed on Aug 25, 2003, after assailants threw an incendiary device at his rickshaw and fired at him near his home. Imam's co-passenger, advocate Bijan Bihari Mandal, and rickshaw driver Saidul Islam Akand were also killed. Imam's son Abdullah Al Mamun filed a case with Khulna police the following day. Khulna police detective Shahjahan Howladar investigated the case and submitted a chargesheet on March 11, 2004, accusing Sardar Imam Hossain, Ganesh Banerjee, Shahadat Hossain and Shukur Ali Gazi. The case was reinvestigated after public prosecutor SM Abu Jafar asked for a fuller probe. The subsequent investigation dropped Sardar Imam Hossain's name from the list of accused after he was killed in a separate 'crossfire' incident, and added the name of Abdul Rabbi Ripon anew, with a new chargesheet being submitted on Jan 24, 2008. Another son of the murdered AL leader, Abdullah Harun Rumi then alleged that senior AL leaders were involved in his father's death and the case was again investigated anew in the light of the allegation. On June 12, detective inspector Chittaranjan Paul submitted a third chargesheet, which found the allegation baseless. bdnews24
