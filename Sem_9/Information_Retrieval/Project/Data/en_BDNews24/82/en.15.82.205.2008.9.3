 Bogra, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com)  The flood control embankment of the Jamuna river gave in at Talukder Para point under Sariakandi upazila in Bogra early Wednesday, leaving four villages inundated, a Water Development Board official said. Some 150 feet of the embankment at Chandan Baisha's Talukder Para collapsed shortly after 4am that hit the main dam. Chandan Baisha, Kutubpur, Kamapur and Karitala villages went under water, WDB sub-divisional engineer Md Zohurul Islam said. Not much damage, however, was done to the inundated areas as the pressure of water was low, he said. "Preparations are underway to repair the embankment," Islam said. The Jamuna river at Chandan Baisha point flew 83 cemtimetres above the danger point on Wednesday morning, he said. bdnews
