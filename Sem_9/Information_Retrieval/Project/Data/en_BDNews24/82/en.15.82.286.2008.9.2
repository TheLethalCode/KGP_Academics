 LONDON, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The long-running Dimitar Berbatov transfer saga ended late on Monday when English and European champions Manchester United signed the striker from Tottenham Hotspur for 30.75 million pounds ($55.37 million). United said the 27-year-old Bulgaria international had signed a four-year contract with their young striker Fraizer Campbell moving to Spurs on loan until the end of the season as part of the deal. "This is a key signing. Dimitar is one of the best and most exciting strikers in world football," United manager Alex Ferguson told the club's website (www.manutd.com). "His style and ability will give the team a different dimension and I'm sure he will be popular with the fans." Berbatov left Tottenham after scoring 46 goals in 102 matches in two seasons since arriving from German club Bayer Leverkusen. The transfer has caused bad feeling between the two clubs with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy making an official complaint to the Premier League over United's approach to Berbatov who has not featured for the club this season. United had an initial bid of 20.5 million pounds rejected by Tottenham last month and they appeared in danger of missing out on their prime target on Monday when rivals Manchester City made an audacious late bid for the player. After confirming Berbatov's sale, however, Tottenham said they had agreed not to pursue their complaint against United. Berbatov has long been admired by Ferguson who can now boast an even more formidable forward line-up with Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez and Cristiano Ronaldo now boosted by the silky Bulgarian. "Joining Manchester United is a dream come true for me. I look forward to playing my part in helping this club win more honours in the years to come," Berbatov told United's website. Earlier Tottenham moved to replace Berbatov by signing Russian Roman Pavlyuchenko from Spartak Moscow
