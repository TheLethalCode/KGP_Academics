<TITLE> Mohammedan clinch Federation Cup </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 1 (bdnews24.com)  Mohammedan Sporting Club clinched the Federation Cup title with a 3-2 win over archrivals Abahani Limited in a tiebreaker following a 1-1 draw in regulation time at Bangabandhu National Stadium Monday. The Mohammedan supporters burst into applause when Abahani's last man Nazrul Islam hit the sidebar from 12 yards to ensure Mohammedan's 3-2 win in the final. Dami Emanuel, Marif Hossain and Abdul Baten Kamol converted the shots while Rajani Kanta Barman floated over the post, but it did not stop Mohammedan from their ninth Federation Cup title triumph since the launch of the tournament in 1980. Jahid Hasan Emily, who put Abahani ahead after the breather, went to take the first shot, but he frustrated Abahani driving straight to Mohammedan goalkeeper Amimul Haq and then Mamunul Islam shot over the post to fade out Abahani's hope of regaining the Federation Cup title after eight years. Afterwards, Wali Faisal and Pranotosh converted to bring Abahani back before Nazrul missed the target. Some 25,000 crowds enjoyed the classic final between two popular outfits at the big bowl after a long time as the last edition of Federation Cup saw a Brothers Union-Muktijoddha title clash in 2005. Emily gave Abahani a deserved lead nine minutes into the second half, but the Dhanmondi-based outfit failed to hold it as Mohammedan striker Robin canceled it in the 69th minute leading the regulation time to end in a 1-1 draw. The extra 30 minutes also failed to produce a decider and the match rolled into the tiebreaker. No team was clearly able to control the midfield in the first half, but Abahani comparatively bossed over their archrivals in the second half. Abahani came close to taking a lead five minutes from the break when an Abul Hossain curving free-kick from the left ricocheted off the Mohammedan sidebar and Emily headed the follow-up wide from a close range. Tournament's highest scorer Alamu Bukola Olalekan should have put Mohammedan ahead three minutes into the second half, as the lanky striker shrugging off his marker Nazrul with only to beat Biplob Bhattacharjee drove straight to the keeper hands. Emily made no mistake in tapping a Wali right-side cross home to give Abahani a lead before striker Robin racing past two Abahani defenders drove a low shot past the Sky Blue keeper Biplob to equal the margin. Abahani were deprived of a deserved goal just one minute from time when Abul's powerful shot from 35 yards was thwarted by the woodwork for the second time to frustrate a large number of Abahani fans.
