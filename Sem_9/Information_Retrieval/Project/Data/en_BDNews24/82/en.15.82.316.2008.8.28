 Dhaka, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com) - Chittagong Mohammedan Sporting Club became the last team to reach the semifinals of the Citycell Federation Cup when the port city side defeated Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan 4-2 in a tiebreaker at Bangabandhu National Stadium Thursday. Chittagong Mohammedan will play against their namesake Dhaka Mohammedan Sporting Club on Aug 30 in the second semis as Abahani Limited square off with sensational Farashganj Sporting Club Friday. Akbar Hossain Ridon put Mohammedan ahead in the 38th minute, but Sabuj cancelled Mohammedan's lead in the 77th minute to take the game into extra-time. The extra 30 minutes also failed to produce a decider and the match rolled into the tiebreaker with Shawkat, Biman, Dowlat and Pavel converting shots to take Mohammedan to the last four. Rana and Manik found the back of the Mohammedan net, but Sabuj and Robi missed the target frustrating the country's lone sports institute.
