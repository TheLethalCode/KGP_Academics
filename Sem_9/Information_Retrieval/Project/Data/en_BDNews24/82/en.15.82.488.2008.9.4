<TITLE> Kerkorian firm settles GM securities probe with SEC </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Sep 4, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Billionaire Kirk Kerkorian's Tracinda investment firm settled a regulator's allegations that it was misleading about its plan to cut its stake in General Motors Corp, the US Securities and Exchange Commission said on Wednesday. According to the SEC, Tracinda had a plan in November 2006 to sell 28 million GM shares but only sold half because the bid offered by the broker-dealer was much lower than Kerkorian had expected. When Tracinda reported the sale of its 14 million shares, it failed to disclose that it had initially planned to sell 28 million shares, which is material information and in violation of SEC disclosure rules. The SEC said Tracinda's report was also misleading and violated securities rules because Tracinda said that the firm "might purchase or sell more GM stock, when there was only a remote possibility that it would buy any GM stock at that time." Days after Tracinda reported the first sale, it sold the rest of its GM stock. Beverly Hills, California-based Tracinda, which did not admit to or deny the SEC's allegations, was not fined and has agreed to stop engaging in similar behavior. In an SEC filing on Wednesday, Tracinda said it consented to the agency's order. Tracinda spokesman Tom Johnson had no further comment. Kerkorian, a long-time activist investor in the auto industry, held about a 9.9 percent stake in the auto giant in 2005 and his adviser, Jerry York, held a seat on GM's board. Kerkorian pushed GM to consider a possible alliance with Nissan Motor Co and Renault S.A. GM's board considered the proposed alliance, but in October 2006 said it would not pursue any further discussions. York, who is a veteran auto industry executive, resigned shortly after and a plan to cut Tracinda's holdings in GM was put in motion. Kerkorian has since raised his stake in Ford Motor Co to 6.5 percent, as of mid-June
