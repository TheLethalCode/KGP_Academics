 Narsingdi, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com)--Fed-up locals in Narsingdi vandalised local Rural Electrification Board office in Chouhala Wednesday morning to protest frequent power-cuts. "Several hundred people attacked our Chouhala office and control room shortly after the daybreak," said Syed Wahidul Islam, general manager of Narsingdi REB-2. Angry people threw stones, brickbats and vandalised windows of the office. They also set fire to a private car, two pickup vans and six motorcycles. Authorities later deployed army personnel and police to face any other attacks. On Aug 24, power loom workers put a blockade on Dhaka-Sylhet highway and demanded removal of Wahidul Islam. People of Narsingdi saw several power-cuts on Tuesday, from 4pm to the time of iftar and from after Tarawih prayers to midnight. Yet another power-cut after sehri drove the people to demonstrate. Wahidul Islam said the guards at the office were helpless during the attacks. "It is not possible for 10 ansars to stop up to 1,000 people," he said. On the power-cuts, Wahidul Islam said: "We get 18 megawatts a day against the demand of 38 megawatts. On Tuesday, we got just 17 megawatts." In the lead up to Ramadan, the government made repeated assurances that it would limit load shedding during the holy month. The chief adviser's special assistant for power M Tamim had said load shedding would be kept to a minimal level during iftar , Tarawih prayers and sehri , in part by ceasing routine maintenance work at power plants during the month. bdne
