<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serena Williams steamed towards a potential a quarter-final showdown with sister Venus by flattening Japan's Ai Sugiyama 6-2 6-1 in the third round of the U.S. Open on Saturday. Although both sisters still have to take care of their fourth-round opponents, Flushing Meadows is already gearing up for the next chapter in the most intriguing sibling rivalry in sport. However, with Wimbledon champion Venus declaring she is playing the best tennis of her career, Serena seemed to be waving the white flag even before she had secured a date with her elder sister. "I'm definitely not at my best, but I hope to get there," Serena, who is tied at 8-8 in their head-to-heads, told reporters. "I think she's playing really well and I'm glad she feels like she's playing her best. It's nice to feel like when you're playing your best. "Right now I'm not playing my best, but that means I can do so much better." The pair have won 15 grand slam titles between them since 1999, with 26-year-old Serena leading the count with eight. Asked if she had ever thought she could have won more titles if Venus had not been around, she said: "No, I don't think I'd have as many because she motivated me, especially being young and watching her play. "I was able to (see) the mistakes she made so when I actually played, I didn't make the mistakes that she made. "Also, she motivates me. When she became number one, I suddenly got motivated to be there too. If anything, I think she definitely helped my career." While Venus has so far dropped 11 games at the Open, Serena has been even more ruthless, relinquishing only 10. The fourth-seeded American had never dropped a set in three previous meetings with the 33-year-old Sugiyama and on Saturday kept that record intact with an impressive display of power hitting and big serving from the baseline. Sugiyama tried her best to throw Serena off course but ended up chasing the ball in vain time and again as the former world number one outwitted her with a string of searing groundstrokes. The 30th seed bowed out by punching a backhand wide on match point, allowing Serena to set up a last 16 date with either France's Severine Bremond or Tathiana Garbin of Italy
