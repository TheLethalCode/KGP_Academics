 Dhaka, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com)  Lawyers for Tarique Rahman on Friday said it would take "a few more days" to complete the administrative procedure for his release from detention following his bails from the High Court in all cases. "We're trying to expedite the process. We hope it will be complete very soon," barrister Kaiser Kamal told bdnews24.com after meeting with Tarique Friday. Barrister Naushad Jamir nodded in agreement. The two lawyers went to meet detained Tarique at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital at 4:20pm. They came out to speak to journalists at 6:15pm. Said barrister Kaiser Kamal: "He is still feeling pain in his backbone and hip. He is very weak." Earlier, deputy inspector general of prisons major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told bdnews24.com, "Tarique Rahman will be released after scrutiny of all the papers from the court." Major Siddiqui on Thursday night said the jail authorities had not received all the bail papers. "Until Thursday night bail papers of seven cases have reached us. Those are being scrutinised." The DIG prisons said: "One or two more days may be needed to complete the whole process." The Appellate Division on Thursday granted Tarique eight weeks' bail on medical grounds in a bribery case linked to the murder of Bashundhara Group director Humayan Kabir Sabbir. Tarique's lawyer Rafique-ul-Huq said after the ruling there was no further obstacle to his release from detention as he had secured bail in the last of the 13 cases that had been pending against him. "The last legal hurdle has been removed with the ruling," Rafique told bdnews24.com. The other 12 cases against Tarique include charges of embezzlement in the Zia Orphanage Trust case and four extortion cases. On Wednesday, the High Court granted Tarique bail in a total of five cases, including three extortion cases, a tax-dodge case and a case on charges of accumulating illegal assets.
