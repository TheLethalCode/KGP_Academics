 Dhaka, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com)Talks between the Election Commission and political parties on registration are scheduled from September 6-9, chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said on Thursday. "We have decided to hold talks with the political parties to guide them on registration," the CEC told reporters in his office. Shamsul Huda had earlier said that the EC would sit with the parties to listen to what they had to say on mandatory party registration under the new electoral laws. He said on Thursday that the parties that had attended the previous electoral dialogue sessions with the EC would be invited to the talks. The parties could have talks on other issues too if they wanted. The EC had dialogue with political parties in two phases from September last year to February this year. In reply to a question, the CEC said that BNP secretary-general Khandaker Delwar Hossain would be invited from the party this time. On the previous occasion, the EC had invited retired major Hafizuddin Ahmed sparking off a legal battle.
