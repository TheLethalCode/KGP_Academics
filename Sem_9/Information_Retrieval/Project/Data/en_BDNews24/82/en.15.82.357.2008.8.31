<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com)Detained former prime minister Khaleda Zia may be released any day, said communications adviser Ghulam Quader on Sunday. Asked if the BNP chairperson would be released from special jail this week, Quader told reporters he was not in a position to specify the exact date and time. "It's certain that Khaleda Zia will be freed, but I can't tell you exactly when it will happen," the adviser said, adding that the legal procedure involved was taking time. Asked to comment on Awami League's criticism of the government over the release of BNP senior secretary general Tarique Rahman, Quader said: "Releasing someone from jail custody comes under the purview of the law courts. The government cannot detain or release anyone without the court's accord." "The matter of granting bail to the detainee lies with the court and we all know that the judiciary has been working independently for quite some time now," said the adviser. The legal proceedings as regards any graft case are going on unhindered, he added. Replying to a query, Quader said: "No, the government hasn't retreated from its stance of combating and uprooting corruption." "The antigraft campaign is going on in full swing." On the government's stance on political parties' claim that the Election Commission was biased in attitude or action, the adviser said: "The Election Commission has been performing neutrally and has established its efficiency and efficacy beyond everybody's doubts by successfully holding polls to four city corporations and nine municipalities." "The forthcoming Jatiya Sangsad elections will also be held under the stewardship of the present CEC." bdnews24.
