Earlier, the BNP senior joint secretary general secured bail in 12 cases, including embezzlement of funds in Zia Orphanage Trust case and four extortion cases. The High Court on Wednesday granted Tarique bail in five cases including three extortion cases, a tax-dodge case and a case on charges of accumulating illegal assets. The case involving the directorship of the Daily Dinkal has been disposed of earlier.
