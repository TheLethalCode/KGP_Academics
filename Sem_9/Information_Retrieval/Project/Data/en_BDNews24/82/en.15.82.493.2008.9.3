 KIEV, Wed Sep 3, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ukraine's President Viktor Yushchenko threatened on Wednesday to call an early parliamentary election after he said the country's coalition government had collapsed. Yushchenko accused his prime minister, Yulia Tymoshenko, of wrecking the ruling coalition by joining forces with his rivals.

The coalition split yesterday, on his own decision." Under the constitution, the two parties have 10 days to sort out their differences and revive the coalition. If they cannot do so, parliament has 30 days to form a new coalition. After that, the president can call a new parliamentary election.
