<TITLE> Mugabe to form cabinet if MDC does not sign deal </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 HARARE, Thu Sep 4,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe is ready to go ahead and form a cabinet if opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai does not sign a power-sharing deal on Thursday, state media reported. Tsvangirai's main opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) responded by saying any attempts by Mugabe to pressure it into an agreement would fail. "Where on earth have you seen dialogue held on the basis of threats and ultimatum? They want to bully us into an agreement, but that's completely unacceptable," MDC spokesman Nelson Chamisa told Reuters. Zimbabwean state media have described talks on Thursday as the last chance for Tsvangirai to agree to a deal to end post-election political deadlock that has worsened Zimbabwe's decline. But analysts believe neither side has any option but to agree a deal eventually. So far talks have been blocked over how executive power should be shared. Tsvangirai has rejected a proposal he says gives Mugabe control of Zimbabwe's power security forces. Mugabe, in power since 1980, said he would form a government with or without Tsvangirai because Zimbabwe could not afford to have a situation where "we will not have a cabinet forever", the state-run Herald newspaper reported. "If after tomorrow (Thursday) Tsvangirai does not want to sign we will certainly put together a cabinet. We feel frozen at the moment," Mugabe told reporters in Lusaka on Wednesday after attending the funeral of Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa. MEDIATION STRUGGLE Tsvangirai beat Mugabe in a March 29 election but fell short of enough votes to avoid a run-off vote, which was won by Mugabe unopposed after Tsvangirai pulled out citing violence and intimidation against his supporters. The election was condemned around the world and drew toughened sanctions from Western countries whose support is vital for reviving Zimbabwe's ruined economy. Zimbabwe state radio said South African President Thabo Mbeki was expected to arrive in Zimbabwe on Thursday to continue mediation efforts. Mbeki's spokesman said there was no truth to reports that he would visit Zimbabwe. Mbeki was expected to meet both Tsvangirai's group and the MDC's breakaway faction led by Arthur Mutambara, whom analysts say has emerged as a kingmaker and has moved close to Mugabe. Mbeki has faced tough criticism for not being tough with Mugabe and regional leaders have failed to end the political crisis. Citing a diplomatic source, South Africa's Business Day newspaper said Mbeki held brief talks with Mugabe and Tsvangirai on Wednesday at Mwanawasa's funeral. Mbeki was expected to propose that that all of Mugabe's executive powers should be discussed and ways be found of dividing them equally with Tsvangirai, said the newspaper. Commenting on state media suggestions that the talks were a last chance for Tsvangirai to join a national unity government, Chamisa said: "If anything, it is a last chance for Mugabe to see the light. If he doesn't, it will be tragic for him and the country." Zimbabweans are suffering from the world's highest inflation rate of over 11 million percent, and chronic food, fuel and foreign currency shortages that have driven millions over borders and strained regional economies
