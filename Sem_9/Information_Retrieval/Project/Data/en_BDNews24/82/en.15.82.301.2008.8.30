<TEXT>
 ZURICH, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Triple Olympic champion Usain Bolt confirmed his domination of the sprints on Friday with a comfortable 100 meters victory at the Weltklasse Golden League meeting. The 22-year-old Jamaican, who set world records in winning the 100 meters, 200 meters and 4x100 meters relay in Beijing, finished Friday's race in 9.83 seconds, 0.16 seconds clear of America's double Olympic bronze medalist Walter Dix. After taking silver behind Bolt at the Olympics, Trinidad & Tobago's Richard Thompson had to settle for third place in Zurich, a further 10th of a second behind Dix. "It was good, but my start was not too good," said Bolt. "I concentrated on winning and as I'm starting to get a cold I was not able to think about any faster time." Fellow Olympic champion and world record holder Dayron Robles was also able to back up his stunning 110 meters hurdles performance in Beijing. The 21-year-old Cuban ran neck and neck with Olympic bronze medal winner David Oliver before ducking his head at the line to finish in 12.97 seconds, 0.01 seconds ahead of the American. JACKPOT CONTENDERS Kenyan teenager Pamela Jelimo continued her fantastic season, following up her Olympic gold medal in the 800 meters by setting the year's best time of one minute 54.01 seconds. Jelimo, 18, kept well on track for a share of the Golden League's $1 million jackpot awarded to athletes who win their event at all six of the season's meetings. "There's still one race to go for the jackpot and the world record is closer now, too, though I'm not sure I can do it this year," she said. With only next Friday's Golden League meeting in Brussels remaining, Jelimo faces competition for the main prize only from Croatian high jumper Blanka Vlasic. After being denied the gold medal in Beijing by surprise Olympic champion Tia Hellebaut of Belgium, Vlasic struck back impressively in Zurich. Overcoming some nervy moments to clear 1.98 meters at her third attempt, the world champion then kept her jackpot hopes alive with the only successful clearance at 2.01. WARINER WIN America's Jeremy Wariner and LoLo Jones were among the other athletes fighting back from Olympic disappointment on Friday. Wariner set his best time of the year to win the 400 meters in 43.82 seconds, 0.61 seconds ahead of compatriot and Olympic gold medalist LaShawn Merritt. Jones, seventh in the Beijing 100 hurdles after hitting the ninth hurdle while leading, cruised to victory in 12.56 seconds. Olympic javelin champion Andreas Thorkildsen further enhanced his reputation with a throw of 90.28 meters - only the second throw past 90 meters this year following the Norwegian's own 90.57 in Beijing. Ethiopia's double Olympic champion Kenenisa Bekele rounded the meeting off by improving on his gold medal performance in the 5,000 meters - setting a year's best time of 12:50.18
