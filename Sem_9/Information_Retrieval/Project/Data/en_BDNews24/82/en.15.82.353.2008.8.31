 Ranchi, India, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suspected Maoist attack in Jharkhand killed 12 security officers on Saturday after the vehicle they were travelling in exploded. "Twelve security personnel including the driver of the vehicle and one police official were killed in a landmine blast suspected to be detonated by the Maoist rebels," said S.N. Pradhan, the Jharkhand police spokesman. Maoist rebels operate in a large swathe of India stretching from the east to some southern states, mostly in the countryside, and attack government officials and property. They say they are fighting for the rights of millions of poor peasants and landless labourers. Thousands of people have been killed in the insurgency which began in the late 1960s.
