 Dhaka, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com)Playwright, poet and former Chittagong University teacher Zia Haider died of cancer at City Hospital on Tuesday morning, aged 72, his younger brother said. "My brother died at around 7:45 am," Zahid Haider told bdnews24.com. He would be laid to rest at a graveyard in his hometown Pabna on Tuesday, Zahid said. Colleagues, friends and students were overwhelmed with grief at the death of one of the leading experimental playwrights of his day. The body was brought to the foot of Aparajeyo Bangla of Dhaka University around 11am for people to pay their last respects. Later it was taken to Bangla Academy where his fellow playwrights and poets paid their last tributes. His namaz-e-zanaja was held at Dhaka University Central Mosque after zohr prayers. Teachers and students of the Department of Music and Dramatics and other departments attended the rites. He was to be taken to his brother's Mirpur house and from there relatives would head for Pabna to bury him.
