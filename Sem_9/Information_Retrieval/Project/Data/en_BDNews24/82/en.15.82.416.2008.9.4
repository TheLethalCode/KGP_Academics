<TITLE> Murray spurred on by parade of champions </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Getting into the semi-finals of a grand slam for the first time is an enviable achievement and yet Andy Murray will not be satisfied until he has etched his name into the U.S. Open annals. Murray lies just two tantalising matches away from becoming the first British man in 72 years to win the New York crown and was inspired to do well after watching the parade of champions on the opening day of this year's tournament. "I'm excited to be in the semi-finals but the tournament is still going," the 21-year-old Scot said on Wednesday after squeezing past in-form Argentine Juan Martin Del Potro 7-6 7-6 4-6 7-5. "I don't want to lose in the semi-finals. When I watched the opening of the tournament on the first night session and you see all the winners of the U.S. Open, you realise that winning is what really, really counts. "That's what I'm going to try and do. I understand getting to the semis is a great achievement but I want to go a little bit further." Murray became only the third British man to reach the last four since tennis turned professional 40 years ago. Greg Rusedski was runner-up in 1997 while Tim Henman stalled in the semis four years ago. But unlike his two predecessors who favoured a serve-and-volley strategy ideally suited to grass, Murray's baseline game is tailored for the hardcourt surface. Despite tripping up in the third set, Murray proved he had the weapons to do well here by outslugging 17th seed Del Potro in an absorbing four-hour battle on Wednesday. STREAK SNAPPED "I don't care what happens throughout the course of the match as long as I win," said Murray, who snapped Del Potro's 23-match winning streak. "I knew it was going to be a tough match. He's won over 20 matches in a row. The guy's feeling unbelievably confident, so I didn't feel like I was the definite favourite for the match. "I knew I was going to have to fight a lot, change the pace of the ball, because he's really solid from the back of the court. My tactics worked quite well," added Murray, who has overcome the fitness issues that let him down in the past. "I played the big points great. In the first two sets, I played really well in the tiebreaks. When I broke a string on my racket, I started to serve a few double faults and lost the rhythm on my serve a little bit. "It was a long match and it would have been easy to get down on myself but I didn't do that. I was really happy with the way I managed to come back." Although he waits to face either top seed Rafael Nadal or American Mardy Fish, Murray will have been boosted by the knowledge that he will leave New York ranked as the fourth best player in the world. But that will be small consolation if his run stalls on Saturday. "How you do in slams is how you're remembered in tennis, and I wanted to improve my record in them," said Murray, who was a quarter-finalist at Wimbledon in July. "(I've) definitely done that this year. Hopefully I can keep i
