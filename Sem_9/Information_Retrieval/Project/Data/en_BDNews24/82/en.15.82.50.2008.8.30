 Dhaka, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com) - Police rearrested Khandker Akhter Hamid Paban, the younger son of BNP secretary general Khandker Delwar Hossain, after his release from Dhaka Central Jail Saturday. Motijheel police arrested Paban, who has been previously convicted in an arms case, on charges of violating Emergency Powers Rules. Dhaka Central Jail official Faruque Ahmed told bdnews24.com Saturday: "Paban got released in the morning in line with a High Court bail order. He was brought back to the jail in the evening for another case." Dhaka metropolitan special judge Md Shafiul Azam sentenced Paban and four accomplices to 17 years each on March 31 for possession of illegal arms and ammunition. Five more cases against Paban, on charges of carjacking, earning illegal wealth and three on extortion charges, are under trial at Dhaka chief metropolitan magistrate's court. Paban received bail in all the cases pending against him this month. He was arrested from Japan Garden City in Mohammadpur on Oct 30 last year. bdnews24
