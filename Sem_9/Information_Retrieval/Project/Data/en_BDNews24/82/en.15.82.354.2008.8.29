<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League president Sheikh Hasina is likely to fly back home on Sept 22 or 23, her personal physician said on Friday. Prof Syed Modasser Ali told bdnews24.com the former prime minister would have a check-up at Johns Hopkins Hospital on Sept 3. Ali also said Hasina, who has been temporarily released from detention pending trial, would go to the special jail set up in the parliament complex from the airport. "Sheikh Hasina will return on September 22 or23. And she will go directly to the special jail from the airport," he said by telephone. Acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman said, "Apparently Prof Modasser Ali said this on the basis of his round-the-clock contact with Sheikh Hasina." On Hasina's going directly to the prisons on return home, Zillur said, "This is a legal matter. At this moment I cannot say anything on this." Ali also told bdnews24.com, "If necessary, an appeal would be made to the government to extend her release." He also commented on the "meeting" between four-party alliance leaders and BNP chief Khaleda Zia at the special jail. "As a physician we want to know from the government and the jail authorities under which jail code Khaleda Zia could preside over the four-party meeting in the jail!" Ali said he and some other physicians had not been allowed in the special jail at different times, which had hampered Hasina's treatment. bdnew
