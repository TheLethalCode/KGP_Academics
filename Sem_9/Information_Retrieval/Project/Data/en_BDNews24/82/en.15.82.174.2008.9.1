<TITLE> Small bomb explodes near occupied Thai Govt House </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Bangkok, Sep 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A small bomb exploded in a central Bangkok police booth on Monday as a stand-off between the Thai Prime Minister and protesters occupying his office entered its seventh day with no sign of either side backing down. The blast, shortly after 1 a.m. (1800 GMT on Sunday), shattered nearby windows but caused no injuries. Police blamed it on agitators trying to depict them as incapable of maintaining order in the face of a three-month drive to oust the elected government. "They want to show that the government and the police are too weak to protect the people," national police spokesman Surapol Thuanthong told Reuters. "It is something we expected would have happened." The bomb detonated shortly after the end of a joint parliament session initiated by Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej to seek a way out of the turmoil that has raised fears of bloodshed and damage to already stuttering economic growth. Samak rejected opposition calls to quit or hold a snap election. Tensions peaked on Friday when police fired teargas and rubber bullets to repel 2,000 protesters trying to storm Bangkok police headquarters. Protesters also shut down three regional airports, all of which have since reopened. Samak has said repeatedly that he would never bow to the demands of the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD), and warned in his weekly radio address on Sunday that his patience was wearing out. "I am not afraid, but I am concerned about chaos in the nation," he said. "We cannot let the seizure of Government House continue indefinitely without taking action." With no immediate end to the political impasse in sight, nervous investors pushed the stock market down nearly 1 percent in morning trade. Thai shares have fallen more than 23 percent since the protests began in May. MORE STRIKES The PAD, a motley group of businessmen, academics and activists whose campaign against former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra led to his overthrow in a 2006 coup, accuses Samak of being an illegitimate proxy of Thaksin. The PAD also proclaims itself to be a defender of the king against a supposed Thaksin plan to turn Thailand into a republic. Both accusations are denied by Samak and Thaksin, who skipped bail on graft charges and fled to London last month. The PAD campaign against Samak, now in its 100th day, has sucked in support from a variety of state unions, leading to disruptions to rail and port services. On Monday, Sirichai Maingam, union leader at state power producer EGAT, urged back-room staff to take a holiday but said production workers would carry on as normal. "We are not going to hurt the people as our strike aim is to slow down the government's work," Sirichai said. Union leaders at Bangkok state utilities are threatening to cut water and power supplies to government offices and buildings if the authorities use force against the PAD. "Their first priorities are agencies that were involved in beating up the people," Sawit Kaewvan, head of an umbrella group of state labour unions, told Reuters. The unions are meeting later on Monday to decide how to intensify their campaign against the government.
