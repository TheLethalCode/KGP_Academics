 Sumon Mahmud and Liton Haider Senior Correspondents Dhaka, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com)  Despite all indications from prisons chiefs that Tarique Rahman was all set for release Tuesday, "the last remaining document" did not arrive in time for the jail authorities to free the son of former prime minister Khaleda Zia on bail. Tarique's wife Zobaida Rahman and other visitors left his bedside at BSMMU Hospital around 8pm Tuesday in a clear sign that the detained BNP leader would not be released before Wednesday, at the earliest. Zobaida had arrived at the hospital at 3:30pm driving past crowds of chanting BNP supporters who had gathered to cheer for the elder son of detained party chief Khaleda Zia on his release. Zobaida's elder sister Shahina Akhter Khan Bindu and BNP secretary general Khandker Delwar Hossain also left the hospital with her later. Delwar told reporters: "At the moment there is no news of Tarique Rahman's release. If there is any news I will inform you." He urged leaders and workers to maintain calm and leave the hospital premises. One of Tarique's lawyers, Mahbubuddin Khokan, said: "Copies of the orders of the High Court in all the cases and bail bonds reached the jail authorities in the morning." "Only the Appellate Division order regarding the (Bashundhara Group director) Sabbir murder case was yet to reach the authorities. It was delivered by 3pm today (Tuesday)." "According to law, the bail bonds must also reach the trial courts. We submitted the last bond at 3:30pm. But Tarique's release is being delayed as the judge did not sign it." He said Tarique would be released after the judge signs the bond and the paper reaches the jail authorities. Inspector general of prisons, Brig Gen Zakir Hasan had told bdnews24.com earlier in the evening that detainees were not normally released if their papers were not processed by 6pm. However, another top official said exceptions to the rule may be made in "special cases". "If the government decides to treat this as a special case and instruct us to release him, we can do that," said the official, who insisted he not be named. The inspector general of prisons had told bdnews24.com earlier in the day that almost all necessary papers for executing the release had reached his office. "We are only awaiting the last remaining document now, which may be sent to us any time today (Tuesday). "It is possible that Tarique Rahman will be released today provided the last bit of paper work is complete and it reaches us," Gen Hasan said Tuesday morning. When Zobaida went to his prisons cell at the former PG hospital at 3:30pm, the media believed Tarique was going to be released. The belief was strengthened when Delwar joined her at the hospital. BNP activists also gathered outside the hospital. Both came out around 8:00pm. Tarique was arrested on March 8 last year, and is currently under treatment in a prisons cell at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital. As many as 16 cases have been filed against Tarique; one of them involving Daily Dinkal has been disposed of, while he has secured bail in 12 on-trial cases. Authorities are yet to press charges in three other cases. The High Court on August 25 granted him six months' interim bail in a Tk 1 crore extortion case and on August 26, another four months' bail in the Zia Orphanage Trust corruption case. Tarique got bail in five cases on August 27, of which three involved extortion charges, one on income tax dodge and another on illegally acquired assets. On August 28, when the Supreme Court granted him bail in the case involving the suppression of Sabbir murder for which Tarique allegedly took huge sums of money, he got bails in all the 12 cases against him. Officials and his lawyers then said his release was only a matter of time required for procedure. bdnews24.com
