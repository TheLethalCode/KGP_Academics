 LONDON, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tottenham Hotspur completed the signings of Croatia defender Vedran Corluka and Russia striker Roman Pavlyuchenko on Monday. The club said in stock exchange statements they had paid Spartak Moscow 17 million euros ($24.92 million) for the 26-year-old Pavlyuchenko, who has signed a five-year contract. Corluka, who handed in a transfer request to Premier League rivals Manchester City, agreed a six-year contract after his 8.5 million pounds ($15.35 million) switch to the London club. He joins fellow Croatia international Luka Modric at Tottenham following his move from Dynamo Zagreb in July. Corluka, who also moved to England from Dynamo in 2007, made 41 appearances for City and played in every one of Croatia's matches at Euro 2008. "I am delighted to be here because I am coming to a big club with great players, great ambition and also my best friend (Modric) is here so it is a very happy day for me," Corluka told Tottenham's website (www.tottenhamhotspur.com). Pavlyuchenko, who scored twice in Russia's 2-1 victory over England in a Euro 2008 qualifier in Moscow in October, has been a target for Tottenham since Robbie Keane left to join Liverpool in the close season. The other main striker at Spurs, Bulgarian Dimitar Berbatov, is widely expected to join Manchester United before the transfer window closes later on Monday. Tottenham have made a poor start to the season, picking up their first point from three games on Sunday with a 1-1 draw at Chelsea
