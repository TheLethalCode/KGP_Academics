<TITLE> Federer gunning for revenge over Stepanek at U.S. Open </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Roger Federer will have revenge on his mind on Sunday when he takes on Czech Radek Stepanek for a place in the fourth round of the U.S. Open. The second seed, chasing his fifth straight U.S. Open crown but his first grand slam title of the year, was beaten by Stepanek in the quarter-finals of the Rome Masters in May. That was one of several surprising losses the Swiss has suffered in 2008, a year that began with a bout of mononucleosis and has seen him lose to Rafael Nadal in the finals at the French Open and Wimbledon. He lost his world number one ranking to the Spaniard earlier this month, but his doubles victory at the Olympics, with Stanislas Wawrinka, boosted his spirits and he said he is beginning to feel good. "After everything I've got through already, these early-round matches, it will only get better from here," Federer said. "I'm really happy to be playing well. Everybody's cheering me on, so it's a nice feeling." Third seed Novak Djokovic, beaten by Federer in last year's final, plays Croatian 30th seed Marin Cilic, while fifth seed Nikolay Davydenko and former champion Andy Roddick are also in action. Four of the women's quarter-finalists will be decided on Saturday, with second seed Jelena Jankovic and number five Elena Dementieva the highest-ranked players on show. Serbian Jankovic, who has needed almost six hours of match play to reach round four, plays talented Danish teenager Caroline Wozniacki, the 21st seed, in the first match on Arthur Ashe stadium. Olympic champion Dementieva takes on Li Na of China under the lights, while former Wimbledon runner-up Marion Bartoli of France faces Austrian 29th seed Sybille Bammer
