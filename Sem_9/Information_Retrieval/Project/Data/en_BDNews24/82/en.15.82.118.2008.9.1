 Dhaka, Sept1 (bdnews24.com)  The BNP on Monday kicked off a three-day programme to mark its 30th founding anniversary by paying tribute to BNP founder and late president Ziaur Rahman at his grave. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain led the tribute by placing floral wreaths around 11am at the gravesite at Zia Udyan in the city. Parliament speaker Jamiruddin Sircar and deputy speaker Akhter Hamid laid down flowers at 9:50am. They were followed by hundreds of party leaders and activists who queued up to pay homage. Special prayers were also offered at the grave for his salvation However, the so-called reformist faction of the BNP was not seen around Zia's grave in the morning. Police stood guard at and around the Zia Udyan and Crescent Lake road area on the occasion. Later Delwar told reporters, "BNP will join the dialogue and run the national polls when chairperson [Khaleda Zia] is released." Delwar also called for speedy release of Khaleda and sending her ailing elder son Tarique Rahman abroad for treatment. "BNP and the four-party alliance wants the emergency lifted and then the national polls first. I hope people will make us victorious once we run the polls with Khaleda Zia leading us." Replying to a query relating to Tarique's bail, Delwar said, "Appeals can always be filed challenging the High Court orders, but we'll expect that such appeals won't pose any hindrance to justice dispensation." In the afternoon, BNP will hold a discussion session at the Engineers' Institution marking its turning thirty. bd
