 Dhaka, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com)The government launched a 20-year Strategic Transport Plan for the greater Dhaka area on Thursday, to include an underground metro, overground mass and rapid transit systems, east-west connecting roads and new flyovers, for easing travel and traffic congestion in the capital. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed, launching the three-phase STP at Osmani Auditorium, said it was aimed at making the city more habitable and improving life for all residents by reducing air and noise pollution and curbing intolerable traffic jams. As Dhaka was turning into a mega city, population boom, economic activity and industry meant more vehicles but without the proportional growth of roads, said Fakhruddin, voicing concern at the resulting loss of valuable working hours and quality of civic life. Calling the launch of the transport plan a historic chapter for Dhaka, the chief adviser said that funding such a mega project would nevertheless be a challenge. The total expenditure, excluding the cost of land acquisition, is estimated at $5.52 billionto cover a 17,400 square kilometre area of Dhaka and neighbouring Narayanganj, Narsingdi, Munshiganj, Gazipur and Manikganj districts Fakhruddin said his administration had already initiated steps to improve the city's transport sector and laid special emphasis on expediting the Dhaka Transport Coordination Board as well as the STP that had been stuck for so long. Implementation of the plan has fallen behind almost three years; the scheduled implementation period for the first of the three phases was 2005 to 2009. The caretaker government approved the project this year. bdn
