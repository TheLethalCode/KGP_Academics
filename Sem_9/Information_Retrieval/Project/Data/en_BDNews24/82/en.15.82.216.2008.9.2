<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serena Williams will play her sister Venus in the quarter-finals of the U.S. Open after wiping out French wildcard Severine Bremond 6-2 6-2 in her fourth-round match on Monday. "Yeah, it sucks," Serena said of facing her sister that early in the championship. "Even the semi-finals would have been better than the quarters, but at least one of us will make it to the semi-finals," she said in a courtside interview. Fourth-seeded Serena never looked tested in the one-hour match against 29-year-old Bremond, who had no answers to the American's power from the baseline and ability to place her shots in the corners. Serena hammered down plenty of big serves but showed a delicate touch too, following up a power shot from the baseline with a deft drop shot that left Bremond standing helpless. Seventh seed Venus defeated Polish ninth-seeded Agnieszka Radwanska 6-1 6-3 earlier on Monday to set up the quarter-final showdown. The sisters' last grand slam meeting came in the Wimbledon final, which elder sister Venus claimed for her fifth singles crown at the All England Club. Neither Venus nor seeded Serena have lost a set during this year's Open and are the only women left in the draw that have won a grand slam title
