<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com)  Title contenders Abahani Limited came from behind to thrash Farashganj Sporting Club 2-1 in an entertaining semifinal to book their final seat in the Citycell Federation Cup at Bangabandhu National Stadium Friday. The popular sky-blue outfit will play the final on Monday against the winners in the Dhaka Mohammedan Sporting Club and Chittagong Mohammedan Sporting Club match, scheduled for Saturday. Khokon Das put Farashganj ahead in the second minute before Pranotosh canceled the lead in the 26th minute, and Wali Faisal struck the decider in the 64th minute amid the drizzle throughout the game to pack the sensational side home. Farashganj, who had moved to the last four without conceding a goal, gave Abahani a tough time after taking an early lead riding on a cleaver strike from Khokon Das. Capitalising on a poor clearance from Abahani's goalkeeper-cum-skipper Biplob Bhattacharjee, Khokon lobbed the ball from 40 yards to find the back of the net though Biplob, running back got his hand to the ball, but failed to stop it. After being stunned by the youthful Farashganj, Abahani, who preferred to wear their second choice yellow jerseys, came back with Pranotosh on the top of the box driving a Jahed Parvez minus miles off target before the medio levelled the margin in the 26th minute. Ghanaian defender Samad Yussif showed his skill to play a superb one-two with his compatriot Awudu Ibrahim and advanced into the danger zone and cut the ball back to unmarked Pranotosh, who didn't hesitate to tap it home, bringing on a wild celebration at the Big Bowl. The Dhanmodi-based outfit, Abahani, should have taken the lead in the last five minutes of the first half, but Arif Khan Joy despite getting into a better position spoiled both chances. After the breather, reorganised Farashganj took possession in the midfield to yield two good chances as Abahani's holding midfielder Joy, being injured, was taken off to allow defender Prodeep Poddar in his place. With Abahani goalkeeper Biplob at his mercy, M Yousuf got into a better position to float the ball over the crossbar three minutes into the second half while Biplob palmed a curling shot from Amamul Haq away for a throw-in in the 52nd minute. Then, Abahani's substitute Prodeep squandered a good chance sending the ball wide from the box before Wali scored the decisive goal in the 64th minute. Defender Sujan, who fully missed the last season due to a knee injury, put the ball on the left for stopper Wali, who ran down to enter the Farashganj box, to smash a left-footer past goalkeeper Al Amin. Farashagnj countered with some brilliant moves, but they could not break Abahani's solid defense marshaled by Sujan, Wali, Siraji and Yussif. Abahani should have scored the third in the 75th minute when winger Jahed set up Jahid Hasan Emily inside the Farashganj box and Emily stopped the ball for Ibrahim, whose shot to the far post drifted left to allow defender Faisal to clear it. The popular sky-blue outfit came close to scoring again, but Jahed Parvez dodging past a defender drove a shot that drifted wide seven minutes from time.
