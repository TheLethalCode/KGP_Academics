 MOSCOW, Sun Aug 31, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European heavyweights Germany and Britain questioned Russia's ties with global institutions on Sunday, a day before EU leaders meet to decide what action to take over the Kremlin's intervention in Georgia. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev sent troops and tanks into Georgia this month to stop what he called a genocide against separatist regions, but he now faces growing condemnation in the West, which accuses Russia of occupying parts of Georgia. Georgia's pro-Western government, which last week severed diplomatic ties with Russia, said it had pulled out of a long-standing peacekeeping deal that Moscow has used to justify the presence of its troops inside Georgia. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said he would be pushing for a "root and branch" review of ties with Russia when he joins other EU leaders for an emergency summit in Brussels on Monday, and an ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Russia should be suspended from the Group of Eight. But Moscow's Brussels envoy dismissed as "unrealistic" all suggestions that Europe might try to isolate Russia on the international stage. French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who holds the rotating EU presidency, called the summit so the bloc can respond to Russia's intervention in Georgia and its recognition of independence for two breakaway regions. "In the light of Russian actions, the EU should review -- root and branch -- our relationship with Russia," Brown wrote in a comment published in Britain's Observer newspaper. He made no mention of possible EU sanctions against Russia. Referring to Russia's role as a supplier of more than a quarter of Europe's gas -- which some observer say has tempered European condemnation -- Brown said: "No nation can be allowed to exert an energy stranglehold over Europe." Eckart von Klaeden, who holds the foreign policy brief for Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) in parliament, said leading industrial nations should meet as the G7, without Russia, until Russia complies with international demands. "The West took Russia in as a member of the G8 grouping of the most important democratic industrial nations even though it fulfilled neither the economic nor the political requirements," von Klaeden wrote in the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. "Thus, these nations should meet in the old G7 format as long as Russia is not prepared to find a solution under the framework of the United Nations." ISOLATING RUSSIA "SHORT-SIGHTED" Asked about challenges to Russia's participation in the G8, Russia's ambassador to the EU, Vladimir Chizhov, said: "The EU is not in a position to throw Russia out from anywhere." "Any attempt to isolate Russia would not only be short-sighted but unrealistic," he said in an interview with Reuters, adding he considered the prospect of EU sanctions on Russia "highly improbable". He also said reports Russia might retaliate against punitive measures by restricting energy supplies to Europe were no more than "rumors" and that Moscow had never used energy as a political weapon. Russia sent in its troops after Georgia's military tried to retake South Ossetia, one of two Moscow-backed breakaway regions. Russia pulled out the bulk of its forces in line with a French-brokered ceasefire deal. But it has kept soldiers and equipment in the "security zones," which include undisputed Georgian territory around South Ossetia and the second region of Abkhazia. Western governments have demanded that Moscow pull its troops back to pre-conflict positions. The Kremlin says the troops are peacekeepers needed to protect the separatist regions from new Georgian aggression. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has accused the United States of provoking the conflict with Georgia to benefit one of the sides in the U.S. presidential race. Britain's Brown said besides a review of ties with Russia, he would be pushing at the EU summit for three measures: a humanitarian aid package for Georgia, the dispatch of EU monitors to the conflict zone and the appointment a special envoy to negotiate with both Tbilisi and Moscow. Georgia said late on Saturday it had annulled a 1994 ceasefire and disengagement agreement -- signed with Moscow after earlier fighting -- that gave Russian peacekeepers the right to a presence in Georgia. "Now the Russians have no rights whatsoever on Georgian territory ... Their presence here is illegal and they should leave Georgia," Georgian television station Rustavi-2 quoted the Reintegration Minister Temur Iakobashvili as saying. Signaling Washington's support for its Georgian ally, the navy command ship USS Mount Whitney was en route to Georgia. The Pentagon said it was carrying relief supplies but the Kremlin has accused the United States of military posturing
