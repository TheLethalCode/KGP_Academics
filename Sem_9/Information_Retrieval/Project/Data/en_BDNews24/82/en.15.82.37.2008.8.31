 Dhaka, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com) - Tarique Rahman's lawyer, barrister Mahbubuddin Khokan has urged all to curb criticisms over the bail and expected release of the BNP senior joint secretary general on humanitarian grounds. Speaking at a press briefing at his Supreme Court chamber Sunday, the lawyer said: "Some media reports and political leaders have criticised the bail to Tarique Rahman. We appeal to them, please don't criticise." "The High Court has granted bail to save the life of sick person. The bail should not be criticised for humanitarian reasons." He pointed out that former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, Awami League general secretary Abdul Jalil and former minister Mohammad Nasim had all been released on parole earlier to seek medical treatment overseas. "We praise the process. There is nothing to criticise in this," said Khokan "The politicians work for the welfare of humanity," he added. Replying to reporters' questions, Barrister Khokan said the process of Tarique's release is ongoing. "He will be releases after the completion of the legal process," he said, adding however that he could not say anything more specific about the release. An Appellate Division bench granted bail to Tarique Rahman on Aug 28, in a bribery case linked to the murder of Basundhara director Humayun Kabir Sabbir. He had previously secured bail in all other of the 13 cases against him, clearing the way for his release from jail. bdnew
