<TEXT>
 Dhaka, September 1 (bdnews24.com)  The government has decided to observe Sept 15 as the National Income Tax Day countrywide to encourage and motivate people to pay tax. The government will reward the highest regular taxpayers at the district as well as the national level on the occasion. An interim cabinet meeting presided over by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed on Sunday made the decision, said a statement of the Press Information Department, the government's press wing. The move aims to bridge the gap between the taxpayers and the tax officials. The National Board of Revenue will try to make people aware of their rights and tax payment procedures, and create taxpayer-friendly environments in the IT departmental offices, the statement said. The highest taxpayers as well as the most regular ones at both district and national levels will be rewarded on the national day every year. bdn
