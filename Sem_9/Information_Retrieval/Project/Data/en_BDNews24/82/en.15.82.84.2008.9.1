<TITLE> Khaleda, Tarique release process ending: adviser </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 1 (bdnews24.com)  Adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said on Monday the process of releasing Khaleda Zia was almost complete and ruled out any "lack of trust" between the government and BNP despite government appeals against bail orders for son Tarique Rahman. "The process of her getting released is nearing its end. There's new momentum in the process," the adviser told reporters after a meeting at the commerce ministry. Earlier in the day, speaking after a seminar on 'Citizen Charter: What, Why and How', the adviser told reporters the circumstances regarding the release of the BNP chief and her elder son had not changed. Asked whether the government appeals were due to a "lack of trust" between the government and the BNP, Zillur said: "There is no need to come to such a serious conclusion over a single action such as this." The adviser was asked whether the government lost neutrality by allowing Khaleda to hold a meeting with fellow party and alliance leaders inside the special jail. "I won't answer this question now. We'll rather prove it through actions. The nation will get the answer in the future," the commerce adviser said. The appeals against Tarique's bail orders came as a consequence of the legal procedure, he added. The adviser said the government was going forward considering political, legal and humanitarian factors. The High Court has granted bail to Khaleda, the BNP chief, two of the four cases and halted proceedings of other two cases. The chief adviser and a number of his colleagues have been saying for sometime that the process of her release is going on. Khaleda was arrested in a corruption case on Sept 3, 2007 and Tarique was detained on March 8 that year. Her younger son Arafat Rahman Coco is now on parole in Thailand for treatment. Speaking as chief guest at Monday's seminar, organised by Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) and human-rights organisation Manusher Jonno, Hossain Zillur said there were still many challenges ahead to enforce citizens' charters. He added that bureaucrats and citizens both have important roles to play if the initiative were to succeed. The seminar, chaired by TIB trustee board member and former caretaker government adviser Sultana Kamal, said a citizens' charter was the expression of understanding between citizens and public service providers on the quality and quantity of service a citizen is entitled to. TIB executive director Dr Iftekharuzzamn lauded the incumbent government for its reform programmes including initiating citizens' charters in the public sector. He hoped the government would take active measures to endorse it in every public service organisation. Arif H Khan, programme officer of Manusher Jonno, in his keynote paper said most citizens' charters of public sector organisations were 'incomplete'. He said the charters lack datelines, client details, and specific ways to redress grievances and collect clients' feedback. Establishment secretary Md Abdus Salam Khan said a lot of government employees did not consider themselves as 'people's servants'. "But they (civil servants) need to remember that taxpayers are supreme and need to be so valued." The secretary cited improved services by government agencies for passports, pensions, the land office and Chittagong port services and said he was optimistic other government organisations would also follow their lead in the future. bdnews
