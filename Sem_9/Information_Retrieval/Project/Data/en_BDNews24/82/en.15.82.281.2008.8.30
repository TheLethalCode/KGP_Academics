 LONDON, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Left-arm spinner Samit Patel took five for 41 and scored 31 runs to lead England to a 126-run victory over South Africa in the third one-day international at the Oval on Friday. His all-round efforts and an unbeaten 78 from Andrew Flintoff from 77 balls enabled England to clinch the five-match series 3-0. "We came into the series as underdogs for sure ... but the boys have been magnificent," captain Kevin Pietersen told Sky Sports television. "It is an exciting place to be, the England dressing room. "But we want to improve and try to win 5-0 if we can. I want the guys to enjoy this victory and then turn up on Sunday (at Lord's) ready to go 4-0 up." Patel, playing only his fourth one-day international, shared a 74-run partnership with Flintoff in England's impressive 296 for seven after acting South Africa captain Jacques Kallis had won the toss and elected to field. England got off to an electric start courtesy of Ian Bell, who hit 73 off 77 balls and put on 101 for the first wicket with Matt Prior (33) off just 15.2 overs. But the hosts suffered a top-order collapse after Bell's departure, Owais Shah (23) and Pietersen (5) both falling to Kallis in quick succession for the addition of just 11 runs. PUNISHING STROKES Their demise brought Flintoff to the crease and the all-rounder produced some punishing strokes to take England to an impressive score. Flintoff survived a blow to the head from a Morne Morkel delivery midway through his innings to strike nine fours and a six. He also made an important contribution with the ball, taking two wickets, including that of the influential Kallis for nine. By then, James Anderson had already pegged South Africa back with some economical bowling, conceding just 17 runs from his opening seven overs during which he took the wicket of Herschelle Gibbs. Hashim Amla, opening the batting, top scored for the tourists with 46 before edging Steve Harmison to Prior, the first of three wickets to fall for just 15 runs which left South Africa reeling on 82 for four. Patel then took over, ripping through South Africa's lower order with the wickets of Mark Boucher, Albie and Morne Morkel, Johan Botha and Makhaya Ntini. Kallis, in charge because of the absence of the injured Graeme Smith, said: "We are not playing good cricket but England are playing unreal cricket. "They are one of the better one-day sides and are outplaying us in all departments. We are not firing on all cylinders and these are hard times for us at the moment.
