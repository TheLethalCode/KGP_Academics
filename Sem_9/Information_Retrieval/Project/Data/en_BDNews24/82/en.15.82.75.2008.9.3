 BAKU/MOSCOW, Wed Sep 3, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia accused the United States of stirring up instability in Georgia on Wednesday, hours after US Vice President Dick Cheney landed in the region to show support for Washington's ex-Soviet allies. The United States has condemned Russia for sending troops and tanks into Georgia last month but Moscow has countered by alleging that Washington helped spark the conflict by failing to rein in its ally Georgia. Cheney flew into Azerbaijan, Georgia's oil-producing neighbor which has close ties to the United States, on the first leg of a tour that will also include Georgia and Ukraine. "We need to wait until Mr Cheney is actually in Georgia to see how he assesses the situation," Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Andrei Nesterenko told a news briefing. "But all these calls on Tbilisi (by the United States) about the need to restore all of its destroyed military capability and so on do not in any way promote the stabilization of the situation in the region," he said. NAVAL DELIVERY Underlining Washington's backing for Georgia, the USS Mount Whitney, the sophisticated command warship of the U.S. Sixth Fleet, was "en route to Georgia" loaded with more than 17 tons of humanitarian aid, a navy spokesman said. U.S. President George W. Bush's administration will announce on Wednesday a package of roughly $1 billion dollars in aid to help rebuild Georgia, an administration official said. The International Monetary Fund is set to reach a deal this week to lend Georgia about $750 million to finance rebuilding work. Kremlin criticism of Washington contrasts with the more conciliatory language it uses about the European Union, which on Monday threatened to suspend talks on a partnership pact but rejected sanctions against Russia, its biggest energy supplier. French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who holds the EU's rotating presidency, is to visit Moscow and Tbilisi next week for talks on the standoff. The Kremlin said Sarkozy and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev discussed Georgia in a telephone call on Wednesday. Medvedev said the EU had adopted a "generally balanced" approach on Georgia, but he expressed regret that the 27-member bloc did not identify Tbilisi as the aggressor in the conflict, a Kremlin statement said. ENERGY CORRIDOR Russia drew Western condemnation by sending its forces deep into Georgia and later recognizing the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent states. Russia said it was morally obliged to attack Georgia to prevent what it called genocide after Tbilisi tried to retake South Ossetia by force. Moscow says it is in full compliance with a French-brokered ceasefire. In an effort to show Russia could still act as honest broker in separatist conflicts, Medvedev was expected to press for a peaceful settlement when he meets the head of a breakaway region in ex-Soviet Moldova on Wednesday. Azerbaijan and Georgia are links in the chain of a Western-backed energy corridor bypassing Russia which the West fears could be in jeopardy after the Kremlin sent its troops deep into Georgia. "It's ... sending a regional signal that America hasn't walked away from the region," Janusz Bugajski, director of the New European Democracies Project at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies, said of Cheney's trip. Azerbaijan pumps nearly one million barrels a day of high quality crude -- equivalent to about one percent of the world's oil supplies -- through a BP-led pipeline that passes through Georgia and Turkey. In a move likely to alarm the pipeline's Western backers, Azerbaijan has said it is re-routing some of its crude to a rival route through Russia, citing the conflict in Georgia as part of the reason
