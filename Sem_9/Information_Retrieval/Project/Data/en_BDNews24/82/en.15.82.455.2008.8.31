 Dhaka, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League on Sunday asked its student front Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL) to cut ties with the party and pursue student issues independently. "You will have to build up Chhatra League as an independent organisation. Chhatra League has to be freed from the grip of Awami League," acting Awami League general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam said. He made the remarks at a discussion organised by the BCL at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh (IEB). Ashraful came down hard on the party's central and district leaders. "I've come to know that a central leader has issued a show-cause notice on the Chhatra League district unit president and general secretary for not going to receive him when the leader had gone to his home district from Dhaka." Ashraful, who was general secretary of BCL's Mymensingh district chapter during the 1970 elections, said, "Now the district Chhatra League committee has to work according to the dictates of the district AL president and general secretary. "But then no Awami League leader would say who to include in the Chhatra League district committee." He criticised the High Court verdict in the Jail-Killing Case. "Some people say criticising a court verdict amounts to contempt of court. How is it that we, the family members of four slain national leaders, will not get justice and will not be able to speak against it, either? It cannot be so. Somebody has to speak the truth." BCL president Mahmudul Hasan Ripon presided over the discussion organised to mark the National Mourning Day. The programme capped the month-long National Mourning Day programme of the Awami League and its front organisations. Awami League presidium member Amir Hossain Amu, Suranjit Sengupta, Motia Chowdhury, former Dhaka University Teachers Association president Prof AAMS Arefin Siddique, former vice chancellor of Rajshahi University Prof Saidur Rahman, dean of DU Social Science Faculty Prof Harun-or Rashid, and Awami League organising secretaries Abdul Mannan and Abdur Rahman spoke. bdnew
