 SYDNEY, September 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia crushed Bangladesh by eight wickets in the second one-day international at Darwin on Wednesday to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in their three-game series. The Australians coasted to victory with more than 27 overs to spare after bowling the visitors out for just 117 then racing to 118 for two in reply. Left-hander Shaun Marsh top-scored with an unbeaten 69 while his fellow opener Shane Watson made a brisk 29 as the world champions followed up their 180-run win on Saturday with another lopsided victory. Wicketkeeper Dhiman Ghosh top scored for Bangladesh with a defiant 30 while Mitchell Johnson was the pick of the Australian bowlers after capturing 3-17. Bangladesh made a terrible start to their innings after winning the toss and electing to bat when Tamim Iqbal was dismissed first ball and two more wickets tumbled inside the first six overs. The tourists recovered to at least eclipse their embarrassing total of 74 from the weekend but were unable to post a target to seriously challenge the Australians. Marsh, the son of former test batsmen Geoff Marsh, followed up his 76 from the series opener with another half-century that featured nine fours and a six. He also put on 73 for the opening wicket with Watson before the latter was trapped lbw by spinner Shakib Al Hasan, who also snared the prized wicket of Australia's acting skipper Michael Clarke in one of the rare highlights for the visitors. Brief Score: Bangladesh: 117/10 in 36.1 overs (Dhiman 30, Junaed 21, Shakib 19; Johnson 3/17, Bracken 2/16, Stuart Clarke 2/16, White 2/39) Australia : 118/2 in 22.4 overs (Marsh 69 , Watson 29, M Clarke 1, M Hussey 8 ; Shakib 2/38) Result : Australia won by 8 wicke
