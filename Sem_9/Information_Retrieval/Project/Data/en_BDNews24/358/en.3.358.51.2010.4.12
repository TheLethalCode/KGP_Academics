 Dhaka, Apr 12 (bdnews24.com)  Islamist fundamentalist party Jamaat-e-Islami will continue with its public programmes throughout the country despite all 'government repression'. Jamaat secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed said Monday that his party would declare some more programmes hoping that 'good sense' prevails upon the government in future. Mojaheed was talking to reporters at a briefing at the Jamaat headquarters in the capital's Maghbazar organised to express the party's reaction concerning the government preventing a public function on Sunday. The police did not allow Jamaat to hold a public meeting in Chittagong on Apr 11. The party was also prevented from holding a meeting at its own party offices. Mojaheed was scheduled to attend a public meeting in the port city's Safa Arcade Community Centre. Supporters of Awami League under the banner of Muktijoddha-Chhatra-Janata announced that they would also hold a meeting at the same venue. Regarding this incident, the Jamaat leader said that the pre-scheduled programme of Jamaat in Chittagong was not foiled by the 'common people' of Chittagong or 'freedom fighters'. Rather, he said, the 'fascist government' was predetermined to prevent its meeting. "The government unashamedly used the police force to foil Jamaat's programme," Mujaheed said. Mujaheed said the government has so far imposed Section 144, barring public gathering, at 15 places where Jamaat had declared to hold meetings. "Until now, 28 Jamaat offices across the country have been vandalised and the government has rounded up more than 800 activists of Jamaat and Shibir," he said. The Jamaat leader also criticised the government for failing to resolve the prevailing power, water and gas crises. Jamaat Nayeb-e-Amirs Makbul Ahmed, Delwar Hossain Saidee, assistant secretary general Mohammad Kamaruzzaman and other top-ranking leaders were also present. bdnew
