 David Bergman Dhaka, Apr 13 (bdnews24.com)A serious blow was struck to the implementation of the 1997 Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord on Tuesday. The High Court ruled that the CHT Regional Council Act of 1998 was unconstitutional. Although the court ruled that it did not have jurisdiction to consider whether or not the CHT Peace Accord itself was constitutional, formation of the Regional Council was an intrinsic part of the Accord. The bench of justices Syed Refaat Ahmed and Moyeenul Islam Chowdhury held that the 1997 Accord must now be read together with its decision on the illegality of the 1998 Act. This means, in effect, that the part of the Accord dealing with the Regional Council now has no legal effect. Despite the blow to the government, the judges gave some guidelines on how it could proceed, and did say that it would be prudent for the government to press on with the peace process. The Attorney General's office told bdnews24.com that it would urgently seek an appeal, and ask the appellate division for the operation of the judgement to be stayed. It is likely that the government will go back to court on Thursday The High Court itself on Tuesday refused to stay the operation of its judgment, or to provide a certificate allowing it to appeal immediately to the appellate division. The judges  who also ruled that certain sections of the three 1989 District Council Acts were unconstitutional  gave their ruling on Tuesday on a petition challenging both the peace accord, and its associated legislation. Bangali settler Md Badiuzzaman filed a petition to the High Court challenging its legality in 2000. Supreme Court advocate Md Tazul Islam filed another petition in 2007. The 1997 agreement was signed between the government of Bangladesh and the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samity. COURT RULING In its ruling, which started being read out on Monday afternoon, the judges ruled that it considered the agreement to be a political "accord between belligerents" and as a result it could not be subject to judicial review. But, the court then ruled that the Chittagong Hill Tracts Regional Council Act of 1998  enacted to give effect to certain provisions of the Accord -- was unconstitutional. It gave two main reasons. First it stated that the establishment of the CHT Regional Council, with the powers given to it, violated the "unitary" form of government required by Article 1 of the constitution. Secondly, the court ruled that the CHT Regional Council was really in effect a local government body  and as such it had not been properly constituted. The court said that for the Council to have been a legitimate local government body, the CHT should have been declared an "administrative unit', as required by Article 59 of the constitution. In relation to the three identical Hill District Council Acts 1989 (as subsequently amended in 1998), the court ruled that two sets of provisions were unconstitutional. The first set of provisions related to the three Circle Chiefs having the power to determine which person in their district was or was not a "non-tribal permanent resident" of the CHT. This was an important provision as only those people who are deemed permanent residents of the districts can vote in the district elections. The court's rationale for striking these provisions down was that the constitution did not allow people to be classified into different racial categories  that of Bengalis and tribals -- and that in any case such a distinction was also against the constitution's equality provisions. The second set of provisions in the Hill District Council Acts that were ruled unlawful involved providing preferences to tribal people for certain jobs in the lower ranks of the district police, and for 3rd and 4th class posts in the District Council. The court held that these kinds of preferences were untenable as there was no objective standard in the Act that set out why any particular kind of person should be given job preferences. However the court did not strike down an important provision within the District Council Acts that makes all transfers of land subject to the approval of the District Councils. It also retained the provision that allowed the chairman of the District Council to come from the tribal population RESPONSE TO THE RULING In response to the decision, Dr Kamal Hossain, a senior lawyer acting for the CHT Regional Council, said, "Upholding of the legality of the peace accord should dispel doubts, sought to be raised by the petitioners, about its validity and should enable the peace process to be sustained." In relation to the decision that the 1998 Act was unconstitutional, he said that it was not a final decision since it was subject to appeal to the Appellate Division. "Also, further legislative action may be taken to continue the implementation of the accord." Murad Reza, Additonal Attorney General said "This ruling will produce a lot of tension in the CHT area which could jeopardise the whole purpose of the peace accord." He argued that he did not think that the submissions made by the respondents were given proper consideration by the court. Barrister Abdur Razzak, who argued for one of the petitioners, told reporters that the court in its order had said that the Regional Council had destroyed Bangladesh's integrity. It had also curbed some rights of Bangalis, he said. The court has ruled in favour of the rule of law, the lawyer added. BNP standing committee leader Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury welcomed the High Court rule. He said that unity and sovereignty of the country has been re-established by this rule. He said, "The treaty that Awami League signed was contradictory to the constitution. That treaty sowed the seeds of division in politics." COURT GUIDELINES The court set out a number of guidelines for the government. It said it could establish instead of the Regional District Council, a statutory public authority which would comprise of nominated, rather than elected, peoples. It also proposed that the government should set up a commission for identifying who are the backward sections of the CHT population, and they should hold elections for district councils on a regular basi
