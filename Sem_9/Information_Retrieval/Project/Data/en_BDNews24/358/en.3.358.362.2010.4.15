<TITLE> PM again blames BNP for power crisis </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 15 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has again blamed the current power crisis on the previous BNP government saying that the current AL government is doing as much as it can to increase supply. "We haven't created the problem," she said while launching the second phase of the Sayedabad water refinery project on Thursday. Hasina had launched the first phase of the refinery project in 1997 during the first term of the Awami League government. It is funded by the Danish International Development Agency. When the second phase of the project is implemented an additional 22 crore litre of water will be available to WASA. In her address, she alleged that the previous BNP government did not add a single unit of power to the national grid. Hasina said that it was not possible for the present government to solve the problem in the 15 months since it won the election. The government is however working hard to address the problem, she said. Power generation falls short by 2,000MW against the demand resulting in frequent load shedding. Residents in many areas across the country have demonstrated for additional power supply. The lack of electricity has resulted in a water crisis in Dhaka  as almost half of the water pumps in the city have no generators. Residents in Mahakhali have taken to the streets twice over the few weeks for water. The prime minister asked Water and Sewage Authority to reduce its system loss.
