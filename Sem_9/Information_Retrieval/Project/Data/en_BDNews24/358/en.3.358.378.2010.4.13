 Dhaka, Apr 13 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain on Tuesday urged the party's grassroots leaders to prepare for a movement against the government terming it as 'pillagers'. He said the people of Bangladesh were miserable as the ruling Awami League government has failed at every sector. Delwar was speaking as chief guest at the concluding ceremony of the party's two-month long union-level representatives' assembly in Dhaka. "To save the country from the hands of these pillagers, the grassroots-level activists of the party should take preparations for a movement under the leadership of Khaleda Zia," he said. Delwar said that the terrorist activities of Chhatra League and Juba League activists have become intolerable. "But the government never takes any action against them." Delwar criticised the Awami League for its recent statement denying that it had any role in controlling Bangladesh Chhatra League's activities. "An Awami League delegation recently told the Election Commission that they do not control the Chhatra League. People want to know then, who controls the student organisation," he wondered. "AL cannot absolve itself of the responsibility of BCL's criminal activities," Delwar said. National Press Club president Shawkat Mahmud said that the people would never stop to believe that Zia was not the declarer of independence. Mahmud asked Khaleda Zia, who was there among the audience, to demand prosecution of Tarique Rahman's torturers during the tenure of the interim government. Among others, former Dhaka University vice-chancellor Emaj Uddin Ahmed, Supreme Court Lawyers' Association president Sayed Mahbub Hossain, former Jahangirnagar University vice-chancellor Mustafizur Rahman, Dhaka Lawyers' Association president Sanaullah Mia were also present.
