 SHANGHAI, Apr 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Michael Schumacher has brushed off criticism of his performance since he came out of retirement, saying he is still in the Formula One title race. The seven-time world champion said on Thursday he had no reason to be disappointed with his first three outings with Mercedes and, if anything, he was making better progress than he expected. "If we have quick enough development speed there's no reason why we cannot fight for the championship," the German told a news conference ahead of Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix.

"The results have not been as great as some people have expected, even myself, but the competition is high. So it is natural I don't have the same positive feeling from the media. "I know exactly what I've been doing, I know what's going on and I have no reason to be disappointed. I still feel very happy, whether people like it or not." The last of Schmuacher's record 91 wins came in Shanghai four years ago but the veteran of more than 250 races was not tempted to wax nostalgic when asked about it. "I am not a person that sticks too much in the past," he said. "I'd rather look forward and have better races than I've had in the last three ra
