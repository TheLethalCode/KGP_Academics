 WARSAW/SMOLENSK, Russia, Apr 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Shocked and grieving Poles awaited the coffin of President Lech Kaczynski on Sunday, a day after he and much of the country's elite were killed in a plane crash in Russia. The elderly Tupolev plane crashed in thick fog near Smolensk in western Russia on Saturday, killing all 97 people on board. Kaczynski had been planning to mark the 70th anniversary of the massacre of Polish officers by Soviet forces in a nearby forest. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin saw off Kaczynski's coffin in Smolensk at a short ceremony conducted with full military honours. A military plane was taking the coffin to Warsaw, where Polish officials said it would be available later for public viewing at the presidential palace. The bodies of the other victims, who included the top brass of Poland's armed forces and opposition lawmakers, were sent to Moscow for identification. Russian investigators were also analysing evidence from the flight recorders. Millions of mourners in staunchly Roman Catholic Poland packed into churches to pray for the dead. Thousands thronged the area in front of the presidential palace in Warsaw, transformed into a shrine festooned with flowers, candles, Polish red and white flags and portraits of the deceased. Acting President Bronislaw Komorowski and Prime Minister Donald Tusk laid candles in front of the Polish parliament as sirens rang at noon to mark two minutes of silence. Komorowski has declared a week of national mourning and has urged Poles to set aside their political differences at this time. Kaczynski, a combative right-wing nationalist, was a polarising figure who made many enemies. "We worked together to build Polish democracy," said Lech Walesa, leader of the Solidarity movement that overthrew communism in 1989 and to which Kaczynski had belonged. "Differences later pushed us apart... But that is a closed chapter now," said Walesa, who often sparred with Kaczynski. Kaczynski's identical twin brother Jaroslaw, leader of Poland's main opposition Law and Justice Party (PiS) and a close political ally, flew to the crash site on Saturday to identify his sibling's body. STABILITY Ordinary Poles said the crash would leave deep scars. "I thought to myself this is a moment I'll always remember. Our grandparents lived through the war, our parents' generation experienced martial law (in 1981-83) and this is the big shock of today's younger generation," said Agata Malinowska, 22, a sociology student at Warsaw University. "Perhaps this (tragedy) is a sign to us to stop quarrelling and backbiting among ourselves," said housewife Urszula Rutkowsa, 57. Despite Poles' deep sense of loss, officials and analysts said the crash should not pose any serious threat to the political and economic stability of Poland, a staunch member of NATO and the European Union. "We continue to monitor the situation and are ready to take various decisions, but we don't expect anything dangerous for the Polish economy to happen," Michal Boni, an aide to Tusk, told a news conference on Sunday. Komorowski said he would set the date of a presidential election which had been due in October after holding talks with Poland's political parties. Under the constitution the election must now be held by late June. The moustachioed, bespectacled Komorowski, 58, is the presidential candidate of Tusk's ruling pro-business, pro-euro Civic Platform (PO). Opinion polls suggest he would have defeated Kaczynski in the election. Analysts said they expected an upsurge of sympathy for Kaczynski's PiS but added that it was too early to predict whether this would translate into votes. While the Polish president's role is largely symbolic, he can veto government laws. Kaczynski had irked Tusk's government several times by blocking health, media and pensions reforms. RUSSIAN FACTOR World leaders expressed shock and sorrow. Putin, whose country is Poland's historic foe, told Poles: "This is a tragedy for us too. We feel your pain." The pilot of Kaczynski's plane ignored several orders from air traffic control not to land, the deputy chief of the Russian Air Force's general staff, Alexander Alyoshin, was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. Kaczynski, often at odds with Tusk's centrist government and the EU, was a staunch critic of Putin's Russia. Putin had invited Tusk, not Kaczynski, to ceremonies last Wednesday marking the Katyn massacre anniversary. Poles noted the irony of a crash that claimed the lives of so many members of Poland's elite near the spot where Josef Stalin's NKVD secret police shot dead some 22,000 Polish officers and intellectuals in 1940, wiping out much of the country's wartime leadership. Russia and neighbouring Ukraine have declared April 12 a day of mourning for victims of the cr
