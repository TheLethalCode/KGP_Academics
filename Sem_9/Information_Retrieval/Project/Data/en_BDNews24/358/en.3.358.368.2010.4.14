 WASHINGTON, Apr 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said on Tuesday that he and Barack Obama have "changed the atmosphere" in Russian-US ties, but demanded more American support on issues from the economy to Afghan drugs. Medvedev also set boundaries for Russia's backing on sanctions against Iran and suggested an air base in Kyrgyzstan might not be the best tool for stabilizing Afghanistan. His remarks, delivered at a Washington think tank after a nuclear security summit he called a "complete success," underlined the achievements and the limitations of Obama's campaign to "reset" Russia ties after years of deepening ran co runder their predecessors, George W. Bush and Vladimir Putin. He spoke days after Medvedev and Obama signed a landmark nuclear arms-reduction pact, a crucial element of the U.S. president's high-profile push to curtail the global nuclear threat. "I am truly glad that our cooperation is starting to bring concrete results," Medvedev told an audience at the Brookings Institution. "I will say even more: I am pleased that in a little more than a year we have succeeded in changing the atmosphere of Russian-American relations." Russia "is ready to give the United States a shoulder to lean on if needed -- and it is needed on a whole series of issues," Medvedev said, hinting at the challenging US war in Afghanistan and its efforts to rein in Iran's nuclear ambitions. SETTING GUIDELINES But he suggested that support would come at a price, mixing warm words with pointed guidelines for US treatment of Russia. While he said the two countries share the common values of democracy and economic freedom, he indicated that after a century of chaos and Communism, Russia cannot be held to the same standards as the United States. "Russia needs several decades of absolutely stable, calm work to create an effective political system and an effective economic system," Medvedev said. "We must not teach one another how to live," he said. While the tone was sunnier, many of Medvedev's complaints echoed accusations levelled by Putin, who steered him into the presidency in 2008 and is still seen as the dominant partner in Russia's ruling tandem. Repeating criticism Putin unleashed at US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton last month, Medvedev said improved ties have not translated into robust economic cooperation and suggested the United States was at fault. He said barriers to Russian investment should be removed and urged Obama's administration to help Russia secure swift entry into the World Trade Organization, saying the issue was being used as a political tool to influence Kremlin conduct. "They have made the WTO into a carrot to hang in front of us and say 'If you behave nicely you will get in,'" said Medvedev, whose country is the largest economy outside the global trade-rules body. IRAN AND AFGHANISTAN Russia has moved closer to supporting new sanctions against Iran, with Medvedev leading the shift publicly. But he reiterated on Tuesday that Moscow would not back measures it considers misdirected or overly harsh. Sanctions "certainly must not punish the people," he said. Medvedev suggested the United States must do a far better job stemming the Afghan opium and heroin trade, which is fuelling a major drug problem in Russia. "So far we have done little to fight drug trafficking from Afghanistan -- maybe because America suffers less from this drug trafficking," he said. Amid geopolitical jockeying after the ouster of Kyrgyz President Kurmanbek Bakiyev from power last week, Medvedev issued veiled criticism of the US air base in Kyrgyzstan that supports operations in nearby Afghanistan. The US military presence in the ex-Soviet republic has raised hackles in Russia, and the fate of the base has been cast into doubt by members of the Moscow-friendly interim government claiming power in Kyrgyzstan. "When I met with President Bakiyev, I always told him it is necessary to help our American partners solve problems in Afghanistan -- the question is how to give this help, how effective it is," Medvedev s
