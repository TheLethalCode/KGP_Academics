 bdnews24.com New Delhi correspondent New Delhi, April 13 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh High Commissioner to India, Tariq A Karim, on Tuesday called on Indian Home Minister P Chidambaram and discussed bilateral security cooperation. "Bangladesh wants to continue with the good relations with India," Karim told media-persons after his meeting with Chidambaram. The envoy did not disclose what he discussed with the Indian home minister. Though the officials of the Indian home ministry also remained tightlipped about the meeting, Chidambaram and Karim are believed to have discussed a range of issues related to security cooperation  ranging from the recent arrest of a Pakistani citizen linked with terrorist outfit Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT) by the elite Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) in Dhaka to India's allegation that the country's Maoist extremists are procuring weapons through Bangladesh. The RAB arrested one Mobassher Shahid Mubin alias Yahia from Chankharpool area in Dhaka. He is suspected to have been involved in recruitment of Bangladeshi youths for the Pakistan-based terrorist outfit. The LeT has for long been a security concern for India. It has come under sharper focus after 10 LeT terrorists carried out the November 26, 2008 attacks in Mumbai. Earlier, the RAB had arrested an operative of the terrorist outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM). The JeM operative reportedly told his interrogators that in 1998 he had helped some of the outfit's terrorists to enter India through Bangladesh to hijack the Indian Airlines flight from Kathmandu to Delhi IC 814. Chidambaram and Karim are also understood to have discussed New Delhi's allegation that some of the insurgent organisations operating in India's North-East are taking shelter in Bangladesh. Dhaka's tacit cooperation with New Delhi in November and December last year resulted in the arrest of as many as five ULFA leaders  its 'Chairman' Arabinda Rajkhowa, 'Deputy Military Chief' Raju Barua, 'Finance Secretary' Chitraban Hazarika and 'Foreign Secretary' Sashadhar Choudhury of the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) and Rajkhowa's bodyguard Raja Bora. Neither Dhaka, nor New Delhi, however, recognised the role of Bangladeshi agencies in creating the situation that led to the arrests of the seven. But, as New Delhi's official versions go, all of them were arrested after India's Border Security Force (BSF) personnel spotted them near the Indo-Bangla border. "I hope the Home Minister is satisfied and India is satisfied. We want to continue with the good relations," Karim said on Tuesday. The chief minister of the northeastern Indian state of Tripura, Manik Sarkar, was in Dhaka last month on an invitation from foreign minister Dipu Moni to attend the Independence Day celebrations on March 26. While talking to the press in Agartala recently, Sarkar quoted prime minister Sheikh Hasina reiterating her commitment not to allow Bangladeshi territory to be used for any activities against India. Tripura has been alleging that the insurgent outfits operating in the state have bases in Bangladesh. Karim on Tuesday is also believed to have taken up with Chidambaram the issue of New Delhi's cooperation with Dhaka for nabbing Bangladeshi criminals allegedly hiding in India, including those who were responsible for the 2004 grenade attacks on the Awami League's rally in Dhaka. The envoy had earlier told journalists that Bangladesh had formally taken up the issue with India.
