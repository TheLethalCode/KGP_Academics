<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 13 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court was ruling Tuesday morning on a petition filed by prime minister Sheikh Hasina seeking to quash a graft case involving alleged irregularities in a barge mounted power plant deal during her previous tenure as prime minister. The bench of justices Md Shamsul Huda and Md Abu Bakar Siddiqui began delivering its judgment at around 11:30am. The Anticorruption Commission (ACC) filed the case against Hasina and four others on Sept 2 2007, during the caretaker government regime, alleging that the accused had taken Tk 3 crore in 'donations' to the Bangabandhu Memorial Trust as part of approving a contract setting up three barge mounted power plants during Hasina's 1996-2001 term. The case alleged that the accused had colluded with Wartsila Power Development to install the three power plants instead of selecting the lowest bidder Hasina filed the petition challenging the legality of the case on Oct 28 2007. In July of the following year the High Court stayed all proceedings in the case. Barrister Fazle Noor Taposh represented Hasina and Khurshid Alam Khan represented the ACC in the hearings on the petition. Taposh on the concluding day of the hearing said that the filing of the case, investigation and approval of the charge sheet, was not processed properly while Alam argued that the case was filed following due process. bdn
