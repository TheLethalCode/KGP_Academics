 Thakurgaon, Apr 11 (bdnews24.com)  A special court in Thakurgaon is due give its verdict on Monday at 3pm in the trial of 51 members of the 20th Rifles Battalion accused of rebellion in support of the mutiny at the BDR's Pilkhana headquarters last year. The Panchagar special BDR court on Apr 7 became the first of the six special courts prosecuting the alleged BDR mutineers across the country to give a verdict. It found all of the defendents guilty. BDR Director General Maj Gen Mainul Islam, in charge of the court based at the 20 Rifles Battalion headquarters in Thakurgaon, fixed the date after he recorded the statements of a total of 33 of the 51 alleged mutineers on Sunday. The other members of the three-member court are Lt Col Mahfuzur Rahman and Maj Didar Al Latif. The Pilkhana mutiny saw over 70 people brutally killed on Feb 25 and 26 last year, with nearly 60 of them army officers deputed to the border force. Rebellion spread to other BDR outposts around the country. On November 15, the government formed six special courts, including two in Dhaka, to try about 3,500 border guards accused in 40 cases around the country. The six special courts are trying charges of mutiny, looting and arson. The Pilkhana murders will be tried separately in civilian courts. In the event of a guilty verdict, the maximum penalty for rebellion under the BDR Act is seven years in jail. Special BDR courts in Rangamati, Satkhira and Feni have also set verdict dates for ongoing trials. Verdicts in the trial in Feni of alleged mutineers of the 19th Rifles Battalion will be given on Apr 18; verdicts in the trial in Satkhira of alleged mutineers of the 7th Rifles Battalion will be given on Apr 19; and the trial in Rangamati of alleged mutineers of the Rajnagar Battalion will take place on May 2. bdne
