 Dhaka, Apr 15 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has warned the political parties that it will suspend the Bhola-3 by-election scheduled on Apr 24 if there are clashes between them. The main opposition BNP, meanwhile, has threatened to pull out of the elections if the EC does not deploy the army. The warnings came following a reported Awami League attack on BNP leader Nazim Uddin Alam early Thursday when he was campaigning on behalf of the BNP candidate Hafizuddin Ahmed. Former BNP MP Alam said Thursday that he was assaulted by ruling AL activists during an election campaign in Bhola. Chief election commissioner Shamsul Huda said a judicial inquiry committee has been formed to probe this incident. The committee was asked to submit its report by Friday, he added. Election commissioner Sakhawat Hossain told reporters, "We will postpone the elections if such incidents recur." Another EC commissioner Mohammad Sahul Hossain had already left for the constituency on Thursday to oversee the situation himself. BNP chief Khaleda Zia, in a written statement on Thursday said her party would launch a tough movement if the armed forces are not deployed before the election. "We will wage a mass-movement against the government, if they want to stage a one-sided election." BNP standing committee member Moudud Ahmed, hinting that the the party might pull-out, also told reporters on Thursday that it had become almost impossible to hold an election in Bhola under the current circumstances. "We'll have to seriously reconsider our participation." Sakhawat said that the commission was not yet thinking of deploying armed forces, but would deploy more than a hundred RAB personnel from Friday. Motorcycles in the polling area will be banned from Apr 20. bdnews24.c
