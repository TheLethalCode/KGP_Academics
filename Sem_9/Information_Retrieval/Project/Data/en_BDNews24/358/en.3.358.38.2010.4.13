 Dhaka, Apr 12 (bdnew24.com)  Amendments of the proposed education policy will be sent to prime minister within this week, said education minister Nurul Islam Nahid. He termed it a 'non-party policy'. Speaking at a teacher's representatives' meeting, organised by the National Teachers-Employees Front, on Monday, Nahid said that the policy will be known as a 'national policy' to everyone. Besides, the policy could be changed and amended in keeping with the demands of the time, he added. The minister urged people to refrain from spreading propaganda that it would destroy the Madrassah education system. He also said that the government had taken initiatives to form a separate wage commission for the teachers. Separate wage scale and recruitment commission will also be formed, Nahid added. Kazi Faruk Ahmed, coordinator of the front, said the teachers' wages should be raised to enhance their social respect. bdnews24
