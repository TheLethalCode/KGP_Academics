<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 12 (bdnews24.com)  The next budget will focus on building up power and energy sectors and curbing food price inflation, the finance minister said on Monday. Budgetary measures for ADP implementation, population control and proper utilisation of research funds were also identified as priority issues at a pre-budget discussion. The talks at the ministry between finance minister AMA Muhith, economists and professionals, as part of a series of pre-budget discussions, predictably emphasised the grave power and energy crisis. Touching on budget priorities, Muhith said allocations for the power and energy sectors would naturally top the agenda, along with agriculture, social welfare and measures to control food prices. He also said the size of the annual development programme (ADP) would be around Tk 380 billion. ADP EXECUTION Economists present stressed the need for incorporating measures into the budget itself to realise the ADP, rather than simply setting allocations and targets. "The budget should have guidelines for institutional initiatives to implement the ADP," said Mustafizur Rahman of Centre for Policy Dialogue, a Dhaka-based research organisation. His view was echoed by Qazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmad, chairman of the Palli Karma Sahayak Fund, a micro-credit funding agency, also chairman of non-governmental organisation Bangladesh Unnayan Parishad. "The capacity of ministries should be enhanced to spend their allocations," he said. POPULATION, RESEARCH Ahmad, a former president of the Bangladesh Economic Association, also emphasised the need to strengthen population control programmes. "These were running at full swing during the '80s, gradually decreasing through the '90s and now there are no such activities." He also expressed concern for unused research funds. "Allocations in the last budget for research into agriculture and climate change impacts have been left almost untouched." "A national research council should be formed to coordinate all academic research programmes and involve policy makers too," said Ahmad. SAVINGS The much debated issue of cutting interest rates on saving certificates also came up at the meeting. The current interest rate is around eight percent. "The government is thinking to revise the interest rate, but should keep inflation in mind," said CPD executive director Mustafizur Rahman. He also pointed out that the portion of bank borrowing by SMEs is significantly lower than that of large industries. "SME's should get exemptions from VAT and excise duty, which will result in lower revenue but will boost the confidence of the entrepreneurs." Simplification of income tax return, measures to boost investment as well as reducing regional disparity also came up at the discussion. ENERGY Rationalising prices of CNG in line with fossil fuels like petrol and octane was strongly voiced in context of rising traffic congestion as well as the energy crisis by former Bangladesh bank governor Mohammed Farashuddin. He was echoed by Nurul Islam, who heads the institute of alternative energy of BUET. "Price of CNG used for vehicles should be a certain percentage of the price of octane and petrol while in case of gas for households it should aligned with the price of LNG gas," he added. bd
