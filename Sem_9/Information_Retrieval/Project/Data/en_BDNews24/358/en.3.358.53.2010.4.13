A fund of Tk 350 crore will be disbursed each year under the supervision of the food and disaster management ministry. The disbursement is likely to begin next fiscal year, food and disaster management minister Abdur Razzak told reporters on Tuesday after a meeting with a WB delegation at his office. The minister said that the bank would provide the money for generation of employment "It would give $50 million annually on a low interest rate under the Bank's International Development Agency fund," he added.

The minister said that the ultra-poor programme requires Tk 900 crore annually - Tk 350 crore of which will come from foreign sources and the rest from the public fund. Each worker under the programme will get Tk 130 a day for their work. A list of the beneficiaries will also be prepared and a database will be created under the programme.
