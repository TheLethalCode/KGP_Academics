 Dhaka, Apr 15 (bdnews24.com)  Tuesday's High Court order that the CHT Regional Council Act 1998 and parts of the Hill District Council 1989 Acts were unconstitutional has been stayed for six weeks. Chamber judge Md Muzammel Hossain of the Appellate Division gave the order on Thursday following an application by the government which had sought leave to appeal the decision. The government has been asked to file a regular appeal within the six week period. The application was filed in the Appellate Division on Thursday morning. The High Court on Tuesday had ruled that the whole of the CHT Regional Council Act of 1998 and parts of the Hill District Council 1989 Acts (as amended in 1998) were unconstitutional. The court had ruled that it did not have jurisdiction to consider whether or not the CHT Peace Accord itself was lawful. But its ruling that formation of regional council  integral to the accord  was illegal struck at the heart of the Accord. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam said in Thursday's hearing that the CHT regional council is now operating, and the tribal people appointed under the provisions of the Hill Districts Act  whose appointments have been deemed illegal - were also working in police and local administration sectors, he said. If the ruling is not stayed the regional council cannot operate, Alam said. He said the government would file a regular appeal against the rule. Since the issue is related to constitutional issues the ruling should be stayed, he argued. Barrister Abdur Razzak, lawyer for the petitioners, argued against this saying that the accord itself had not been deemed unconstitutional and only parts of the district council acts were deemed illegal Attorney general Alam told a briefing after the stay order that the High Court ruling, if allowed to remain, will jeopardise the peace process in the Chittagong hill tracts region and create administrative complication. The rule had been stayed taking these issues into accounts, he said. bdnew
