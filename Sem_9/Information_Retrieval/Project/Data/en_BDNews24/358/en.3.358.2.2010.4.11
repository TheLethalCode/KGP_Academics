 Sylhet, Apr 11 (bdnews24.com)  The parliament has become a meeting place of the ruling Awami League, opposition whip Zainul Abdin Farroque said on Sunday. Farroque, also the publicity secretary of main opposition BNP, was speaking as chief guest at a meeting organised by the Sylhet metropolitan BNP. The BNP leader accused AL of turning the parliament into their meeting place despite their constant harping on the strengthening of multi-party democracy. "The government is busy in ridiculing Zia's dead body in parliament rather than trying to resolve severe crises of power, water and gas," Farroque said. He said several false cases meant for harassment were filed against him for speaking against the 'theft and corruption' of prime minister Sheikh Hasina and her son Sajeeb Ahmed Wazed. "But I do not fear even if lakhs of more cases are filed against me. The truth will be divulged one day," Farroque said. BNP central organising secretary and Sylhet district unit president M Ilias Ali, former deputy mayor of Chittagong City Corporation Dastagir Chowdhury and other BNP leaders also spoke at the meeting. bdne
