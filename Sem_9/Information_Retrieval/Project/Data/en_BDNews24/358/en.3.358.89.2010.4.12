<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 12 (bdnews24.com)  A non-governmental organisation has alleged widespread corruption in handling of funds allocated for Cyclone Aila-affected areas. Cyclone Aila struck the south-wester parts of Bangladesh on May 25, 2009. A delegation of Nagorik Sanghati, having returned from a trip to the affected areas, presented their observations at the National Press Club on Monday. Sharifuzzaman Sharif, general secretary of Nagorik Sanghati said that although almost one year has passed since the cyclone people are still struggling to return to their normal lives. The affected people have failed to return to their homes even after promises were made by the ministers, political leaders, members of parliament and government officials. In the keynote paper, the organisation also noted that despite lofty promises from the minister for food and disaster management and water resources minister there is no sign of rebuilding the damaged dams. It has also been reported that the building of the new 'ring enclosure' in Gabura will leave out a fourth of the area and will expose the inhabitants to further flood. Sharif brought allegations of corruption in handling of Tk 300 crore for reconstruction of embankments and other works. He said that the situation in the ground does not look like that much money has been spent. "It looks like the main objective was to make sure that the projects takes a long time and requires a lot of money." Saying that people are very angry, Sharif noted that the locals do not want relief materials or other assistance. "All they want is the embankments to be rebuilt so that they can return to their homesteads." He also said that saline water was being let into arable lands for shrimp farming, despite court ruling prohibiting it. b
