<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 11 (bdnews24.com)  Main opposition BNP will prepare a report on the 'unbearable sufferings' of people as 'the government has failed to do anything'. The party will then submit it to the party chief Khaleda Zia, BNP join secretary general Aman Ullah Aman said Sunday. This report will be prepared on the basis of opinions from the grassroots level party activists across the country in a month-long grassroots level representatives' meeting. Aman Ullah Aman, senior BNP leader and joint secretary general of the delegates' meeting of Dhaka, disclosed the information to reporters at a media briefing. The month-long grassroots-level meet was launched on Mar 6 in Sylhet and will end on Apr 13 in Dhaka. Tarique Rahman, BNP chief's son and currently senior vice-chairman of the party, launched the grassroots-level convention on Jan 4, 2005 to create a direct link between the grassroots and the top central leaders. Aman, criticising the government for its failure, said that it had failed in each and every sector. "People cannot take it anymore." "Not only in Dhaka, electricity is also not available for up to 21 hours a day even in small districts like Kurigram." The law and order situation of the country has collapsed, he said. Factions of the ruling party are busy with grabbing tenders or manipulating government contracts for a quick buck, Aman alleged. "It seems there is no government at all." He also criticised the government for 'falling short' in controlling price hike, human rights situation and for 'repressive measures taken against the Zia's family'. "This government should resign immediately." bd
