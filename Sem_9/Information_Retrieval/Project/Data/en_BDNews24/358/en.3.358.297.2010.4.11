 Dhaka, Apr 11 (bdnews24.com)  War crimes investigation to identify criminals of 1971 Liberation War are being seriously hampered by lack of logistic support. Head of the investigation agency, Abdul Matin told reporters on Sunday that the investigators did not have adequate support to work smoothly. He said that the investigators would find it impossible to bring articles of evidence from different places and store them under the auspices of the agency. Matin referred to items in the national archives and said certain video clips could not be picked out from there and brought over. "We do not have the technical support or personnel to conserve such sensitive documents or items." The lead investigator for the War Crimes Tribunal, set up recently to try individuals who committed crimes against humanity during the Liberation War in 1971, also mentioned that the investigators did not even have enough vehicles for running the investigation smoothly. Matin said that the investigation agency was given only one car. "Some seven or eight of us pile into a car and go to places." He said the agency's investigators have yet to visit a number of important places for collecting evidence. The agency chief also said, "It is not possible to submit the investigation report within a month on an issue that is 39 years old. "The report will be presented as soon as possible," he added. The investigating agency on the war crimes trial is set to move immediately for testimonies of witnesses, said Matin. He said it would begin soon at the grassroots level after scrutinising documents and evidence from different organisations. The Liberation War Museum, War Crimes Fact Finding Committee and Ain o Salish Kendro have already provided documents to the agency. The government on Mar 25 formed the agency, tribunal and prosecution to try those who violated human rights and involved in crimes against humanity. bdnews24.
