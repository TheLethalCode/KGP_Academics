 Dhaka, April 11 (bdnews24.com)  The ruling Awami League has decided to observe the historic Mujibnagar Day. The party has declared programmes in Dhaka and in Mujib Nagar to commemorate the 39 anniversary of the day. The government-in-exile, which was later known as Mujibnagar Government, took oath at a quiet mango grove of Baidyanathtola under Meherpur in Kushtia district in 1971. On April 17, the party will start the day by raising the national and party flags at dawn. At 7am the Awami League will place a wreath at the portrait of the country's founding president Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and at the graves of the four slain national leaders. A team of AL members will go to Mujibnagar and place wreaths at the local martyr's monument. There will also be a discussion and cultural programme in the list of activities. bd
