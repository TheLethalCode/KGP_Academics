<TITLE> ICC promises not to repeat 2007 mistakes in T20 WC </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 12 (bdnews24.com) -- International Cricket Council has learnt from the mistakes it made in the 2007 World Cup and would lower the ticket prices to ensure that the Twenty20 World Championship doesn't prove to be another flop show in the West Indies, ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat said, reports PTI. "We have learnt from the 2007 World Cup. Perhaps pricing of the tickets was the fundamental reason (behind low turnout) there. It was not really affordable for them. The Caribbeans are small communities and it was not affordable for them to buy tickets of all matches," Lorgat said. Spelling out plans to woo the locals for the April 30-May 16 ICC World Twenty20, Lorgat said, "While pricing of the ticket is key, we are also retaining the Caribbean flavour this time." "Every territory has its own style and culture and we will encourage them to get involved in their own way. I'm hoping they would come out in full swing and there will be a party atmosphere all around," said Lorgat who was in New Delhi on Monday to display the ICC World Twenty20 trophy. The Twenty20 World Cup begins just five days after the completion of the Indian Premier League III but Lorgat didn't see any harm in that. "Last year too, IPL preceded the Twenty20 World Cup in England, which was reported as a successful event. I see IPL as great forerunner to Twenty20 World Cup," he said. Lorgat also took the occasion to reiterate that there would be no separate window for IPL. "As I have said in the past, I don't envisage a window for IPL, which is a domestic event. It's difficult to incorporate all domestic tournaments. The Future Tours Programme schedules only international cricket. In addition to that, IPL (governing council) has not sought any window," Lorgat explained. The South African said he expects Twenty20 would open up new market for cricket but not at the cost of the game's two other formats. "There is no question about Twenty20's popularity. It has taken off beyond expectation but I don't think other formats are not popular. "Most would acknowledge that in the last 12-18 months, we have seen some fascinating one day matches. When Sachin Tendulkar scored 200, most people were of the view that 50-overs cricket would definitely survive. It's important how we manage the formats," Lorgat
