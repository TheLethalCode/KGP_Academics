 Dhaka, Apr 14 (bdnews24.com) -- England batsman Kevin Pietersen has said his national team-mates, particularly the bowlers, may have made a mistake by skipping the IPL to preserve themselves for future assignments, reports Cricinfo. Pietersen, who is in India to play for Royal Challengers Bangalore, felt the IPL was a good platform to pick up the basics of the Twenty20 game and perfect one's skills ahead of the ICC World Twenty20, which immediately follows the IPL. Besides Pietersen, the other England participants include Paul Collingwood, Ravi Bopara, Michael Lumb, Owais Shah and Graham Napier.

"The more you play the better you become, so for us all to be available for the full six weeks of the IPL, like most of the other countries, would be really good," Pietersen added. The most impressive of the English players happens to be his Hampshire team-mate and attacking opening batsman, Lumb. The left-hander with the Rajasthan Royals is also part of the World Twenty20 squad. He cemented his place in the XI from the beginning but the rest, including Pietersen, aren't certainties partly because they joined their franchises late owing to their commitments in Bangladesh. "I am not surprised he [Lumb] has done well," Pietersen said. "He has been really good at this form of the game in the way he has excelled at getting good starts.
