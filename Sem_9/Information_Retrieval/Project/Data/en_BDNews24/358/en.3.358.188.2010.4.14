 KUALA LUMPUR, Apr 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Malaysia's opposition named a candidate seen as a successor to its leader Anwar Ibrahim to run in a by-election this month which will also test the ruling coalition's popularity following moves to reduce race-based programmes. Anwar late on Tuesday picked Zaid Ibrahim, 59, a former law minister who quit the government in 2008, to run for the Hulu Selangor parliament seat on April 25. Prime Minister Najib Razak's ruling National Front coalition is expected to announce its candidate for the by-election on Thursday. The campaign for the high-stake election starts on Saturday. The vote will not alter the balance of power in parliament but will be an early verdict on Najib's "New Economic Model" launched last month to win back foreign investment and boost growth. The government says the plan is a step toward replacing Malaysia's four-decade-old race-based affirmative action policies, triggering fears of a backlash from the majority ethnic Malay population whose support is critical to the coalition. "For Najib, the by-election will give an indication of whether people are really buying into the New Economic Model as well as his leadership," said Ibrahim Suffian from the independent pollster the Merdeka Center. An opposition victory, on the other hand, would help it regain political traction after the defection of four MPs last month amid infighting among the Islamists and Chinese secularist urban reformers who make up Anwar's broad-based People's Alliance. A win by Zaid, seen as a reformist, would also keep the opposition on track in the event that Anwar is convicted on charges of sodomy for which he is on trial and which he claims is a political conspiracy. "Aside from showcasing a potential national leader with Zaid, this by-election will be seen as a gauge on whether Anwar and the People's Alliance can overcome their recent setbacks," said Ibrahim. Political uncertainty in Malaysia since elections in 2008 has hit net portfolio and direct investment outflows to the tune of $61 billion in 2008 and 2009, according to official data. Malaysia's economy shrank 1.7 percent in 2009. REFORM DOUBTS Najib has vowed to push through the reforms but doubts remain about his ability to weather a voter backlash. He promised to cut fuel subsidies to tackle the country's budget deficit which hit a more than 20 year high of 7.4 percent of gross domestic product last year but it was withdrawn later. Similarly, plans to debate a goods and services tax (GST) in the current parliamentary session were withdrawn due to the risk of hurting the government's popularity, as were proposals for electricity price hikes. The emergence of right-wing conservative Malay groups that have sprung up to "defend" Malay rights has added to the pressure on the ruling coalition. That has worried investors who are wary that reform promises may not be carried out and who were less than enthusiastic when Najib announced his "New Economic Model" last month. "The country cannot afford too many execution delays and policy flip-flops. The country needs to understand that too many U-turns make a roundabout," said Citigroup in an April 8 research n
