 Dhaka, Apr 12 (bdnews24.com)Residents of two Dhaka University halls have staged a demonstration demanding an end to the prevailing water and power crises. The female students of Kuwait Moitri hall brought out a procession outside the hall at around 10pm Monday and those of Sheikh Fazilatunnesa hall inside their hall at the same time. They were scheduled to demonstrate in front of the residence of the vice-chancellor Monday night. But the teachers stopped them on their way. They said students of the two halls had been facing severe water and power crisis for the last few days. There was no end to their plight even after they complained to the teachers. Kuwait Moitri hall provost Farida Begum told bdnews24.com that initiatives were on to calm the situation. "We talked to the WASA authorities in this connection. We're also supplying about 2000 litres of water from the arts faculty everyday," she added. bdnews24
