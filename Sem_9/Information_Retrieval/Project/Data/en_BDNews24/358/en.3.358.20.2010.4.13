<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 13 (bdnews24.com)The main opposition BNP has reiterated its demand to deploy army in the upcoming Bhola-3 by elections scheduled on Apr 24. A two-member delegation of BNP, comprising standing committee member Nazrul Islam Khan and senior joint secretary general Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, raised the demand when they met the chief election commissioner on Tuesday. BNP's Maj (retd) Hafizuddin Ahmed and Md Nurunnabi Chowdhury of the Awami League are set to run in the elections. Both the candidates earlier this month complained against each other from press conferences alleging that the other had attacked their supporters ahead of the elections. After the hour-long meeting, also attended by the election commissioners, Nazrul Islam Khan told reporters that they had informed the CEC of their experience about the current situation in Lalmohon and Tazmuddin. "We want fair and peaceful elections there. That's why we're demanding army deployment." Regarding the law and order situation of the constituency, Khan said, "Even on Monday, six BNP supporters including a school-teacher was beaten, but the EC did not take any steps after the first complaint was submitted." "The local administration did not take any measures either, and that too after an election commissioner directed the arrest of three accused." The BNP leader said that there would be no difference between taking part in the elections or not, if such a situation prevailed in that constituency. He said that they had asked the CEC for taking immediate steps. Regarding the commission's pledges, he said, "RAB will be deployed from Apr 16." "EC will also appoint two observers in each upazila, while the CEC will visit the area on Apr 18," the senior BNP leader added. Earlier, the BNP delegation met the commissioners twice, on Mar 22 and Apr 6. bdnews
