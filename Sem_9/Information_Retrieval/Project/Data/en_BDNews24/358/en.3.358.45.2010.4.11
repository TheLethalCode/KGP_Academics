 Dhaka, Apr 11 (bdnews24.com)---Prime minister's adviser Professor Alauddin Ahmed on Sunday said that reform in the bureaucracy is a prerequisite for improved public welfare and good governance. The prime minister's education, social development and political affairs adviser Alauddin Ahmed was speaking as a chief guest at a seminar at Brac Centre in the capital on Sunday. "A file needs to be signed and countersigned by administrative officials as well as secretaries before its final approval," he said, adding that sometimes absence of secretaries from a particular meeting can result in delays in the process. Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) hosted the international seminar 'Pledge of Honesty: Ensuring Participatory Good Governance through Social Accountability'. Representatives from a total of 12 of the organisation's country chapters in Europe, Africa and Asia attended the seminar. "MPs have been made head of the parliamentary standing committees with the mission of ensuring accountability," Alauddin said, adding that the corruption scenario in the country has undergone a change. "The government is working to purge the country of corruption," he said TIB executive director Iftekharuzzaman presented the key paper at the seminar. "It is possible to curb power manipulation through pledges of honesty," Iftekhar said He added that nine academic institutions and nine local government bodies have so far signed an affidavit of honesty. Citizen for Good Government (SUJAN) president professor Mozaffar Ahmed said that the system of accountability had not yet been introduced in the parliament. He urged MPs to raise their voice against corruption. The seminar, chaired by TIB's Trust Board chairman M Hafijuddin Khan, was also addressed by the executive director of TI Zambia chapter Goodwell Lungu and secretary general of TI Indonesia chapter Teten Mosdula. bdne
