The dead, Sayma Sultana Ani, of Trishal upazila in Mymensingh, was a year-first student. Her father works at Fenchuganj Fertiliser Factory. It could not be ascertained why she killed herself. Dr Yasmin Haque, provost of the female student hall said that it might have been because she had become very upset after speaking over her mobile phone. Although it is suspected that the suicide might be connected to a love affair, her friends could not give any convincing reason. One of her friends said that Ani was a very quiet and open-minded girl. They could never imagine that she would leave them. Ani talked to someone before going to bed and behaved normally. A student found a toilet door closed at dawn. Ani was also missing. Then they broke the door and recovered Ani's hanging body. She was immediately brought to Sylhet Osmani Medical Hospital where the on-duty doctor declared her dead. The body was sent for post mortem after which it would be handed over to her guardians.
