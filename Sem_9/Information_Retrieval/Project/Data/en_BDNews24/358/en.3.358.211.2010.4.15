<TITLE> MPs muddle Muhith's transparency bid </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 15 (bdnews24.com)  The finance minister's attempt at increased transparency suffered a blow due to the opposition of his parliament colleagues. The finance minister, AMA Muhith, had decided to allow media presence during heretofore closed-door pre-budget discussions on Thursday. The day's pre-budget discussion with the parliamentary standing committees began with Muhith making an announcement to that effect. There is something new today, the finance minister had told his colleagues. "I am going to allow the press for the first time here." The announcement met with a cold response at the very onset. Tofail Ahmed, a senior Awami League leader, also the chair of the standing committee on industries, was the first to speak at the discussion. He said that the move by the finance minister was laudable. The former commerce and industries minister said that it was a good initiative towards transparency. "Nonetheless, I feel a little embarrassed to speak my mind." He was obviously referring to the pool of journalists present at the finance ministry's conference room. Suranjit Sengupta was the next in line to speak. But after Sengupta finished his speech, Muhith asked the camera crew of the television channels, roving around the room, to remain seated and not distract the discussants. It was at this point that Israfil Alam, chairman of standing committee on labour and employment, raised a hullabaloo strongly objecting to media presence. He said that the media should not have been allowed to attend in the first place because this was expected to be a candid discussion. "But we will not be able to speak openly if the media is present." Israfil's objection met with open support among the other MPs. At such a turn of events, the visibly embarrassed Muhith requested the press to leave.
