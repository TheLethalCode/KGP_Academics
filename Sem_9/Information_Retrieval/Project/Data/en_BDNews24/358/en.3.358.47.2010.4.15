A High Court bench of justices Siddiqur Rahman Miah and Farah Mahbub granted Milon, at present behind the bars, gave bail for a period of three-months. The court also asked the government to explain why Milon should not be granted permanent bail. Advocate FM Muneer stood for the former state minister in the court.
