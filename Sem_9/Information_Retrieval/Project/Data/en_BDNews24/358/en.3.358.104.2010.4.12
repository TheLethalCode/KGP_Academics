 Dhaka, Apr 12 (bdnews24.com) BNP pledged to regularise appointments of all teachers of private and non-government educational institutions enlisted under Monthly Pay Order. BNP chairperson Kahleda Zia said on Monday that once in power, BNP will ensure that teachers' financial needs are taken care of. She agreed that it was a difficult task. "But we don't think it's impossible to do something for the benefit of teachers." Khaleda was speaking at a conference organised by teachers' representatives. She was speaking in reference to a long demand of teachers from non-government educational institutions that their temporary appointments be made permanent and salaries regularised. She also asked them to unite against the injustices of the ruling Awami League-led government. The conference took place at Bangabandhu International Conference Centre where some 3,000 councillors and delegates participated. Shikkhak Karmachari Oikkojote, College Shikkhak Samity and Shikkhak Samity jointly orgnaised the conference. Discussants at the conference demanded for regularising the appointments of teachers and staff of non-government institutions from the secondary level to tertiary level. They also asked for a stop to harassment of teachers and suspension from their jobs. Citing the current situation of the country, the former prime minister said referring to the ruling AL government, "Their election-pledges have become a mockery." She highlighted the high price of food essentials, power and gas crises, saying, "The teachers have to come forward to save the people." Khaleda also criticised the activities of Chhatra League, the ruling AL's student wing, citing tender violence and occurrences in educational institutions including at Eden College, Badrunnesa College and Anandomohan College in Mymensingh. She blamed the government for recruiting unqualified teachers for money, which is further deteriorating education quality. "The education sector will be destroyed if such practices continue." Accusing the government of plotting against religious education, Khaleda said, "It's a demand of the times to focus on religious and ethical education." bd
