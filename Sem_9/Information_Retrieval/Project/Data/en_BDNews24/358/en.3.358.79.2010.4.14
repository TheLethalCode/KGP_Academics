 JOHANNESBURG, Apr 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South African fans will be able to snap up half a million unsold World Cup tickets in cash after FIFA agreed on Wednesday to drop a ruling that they could only be bought online or through a ballot procedure. The final phase of sales for the month-long tournament beginning in June will see ticket selling points in shopping malls in the nine host cities plus a network of popular supermarkets.

"We have always said that it is important that we make this World Cup more accessible to the people and with the over-the-counter sales, we believe this measure is consistent with the needs of the fans."

A special category of tickets for residents of South Africa sells at $20 (13) but costs escalate drastically in higher categories for better seats and after the first-round group phase. Tickets for premier seats at the final costs $900. Demand in South Africa had initially been sluggish but the most recent phase saw locals snap up 85 percent of the 240,000 tickets sold between February and the beginning of this month. FIFA said last week 2.2 million tickets have been sold for the tournament, which kicks off on Jun
