 Chittagong, Apr 15 (bdnews24.com)  Banned Islamist outfit Hizb-ut Tahrir on Thursday brought out a procession at Jamalkhan area in Chittagong. Witnesses said that 25-30 people, carrying a Hijb-ut Tahrir banner, took out the procession from the port city's Cheragi crossing to the Press Club. Four to five banners were hung at the Press Club and the marchers then left the scene by auto-rickshaws. The participants under the banner of 'Hijb-ut Tahrir Ulaiyah Bangladesh' chanted anti-government slogans. Kotwali police chief Mohiuddin Mahmud admitted he had seen the banners hanging in the press club, but he denied that a procession had taken place. "They could not bring out any procession. They only hung some banners and left the place soon," Mahmud said. When the police official was informed that many people had seen the procession, he then said the police could not take any action as the demonstrators had left the area quickly. The banners had been seized, he said. The government banned Hijb-ut Tahirir last year on charge of involvement with militant activities. bd
