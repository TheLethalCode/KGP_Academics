 KABUL, Apr 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United Nations has agreed to pay for parliamentary elections in Afghanistan once changes to its poll bodies are announced, the president's spokesman said on Tuesday, after threats from the West it could withhold funds. Following last year's fraud-marred presidential poll, in which a third of Karzai's votes were tossed out in a UN-backed inquiry, Western donors have said they would be reluctant to fund another vote without reforms to the voting system. Karzai's relations with the West have been strained since the presidential poll, which cost Western governments $220 million. Those tensions came to a head earlier this month when Karzai lashed out at the West, accusing it of perpetrating the vote fraud last year. Both sides tried to move beyond the row this week, with Washington calling Karzai a "reliable partner". Karzai announced last week he was replacing the top two officials from the country's election commission, which the West accused of allowing fraud in last year's presidential poll. Karzai's spokesman, Waheed Omer, said the president would hold a meeting on Thursday to pick a new head and deputy for the election commission, and make the the names public by next week. Karzai will also announce the five members of a separate election watchdog responsible for monitoring fraud, Omer said. Karzai issued a decree in February stripping the United Nations of the power to name three of the five, but later partly backed down, saying he would let the international body nominate two. Omer said that U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura had promised Karzai at a meeting on Tuesday that the United Nations would make funds available and begin working on the election as soon as the make-up of the commission and the watchdog were set. A U.N. spokesman said the result of talks between de Mistura and Karzai on election procedures would be announced on Thursday. NATO TROOPS TO SECURE ELECTION Over the past few months, Karzai had been wrangling with parliament and the United Nations over how the election should be run. Karzai sought to limit the influence of foreigners on a fraud watchdog that overturned his first-round victory last year. Holding a free and fair parliamentary election is seen as a key test for Afghanistan, which is facing a resurgent Taliban, despite the presence of tens of thousands of Western troops more than eight years after the militants were removed from power. Attacks and threats by Taliban fighters, especially in the restive south, kept voters away from last year's election and facilitated vote-rigging. Omer said the top U.S. and NATO military commander in Afghanistan, General Stanley McChrystal, had told Karzai his troops would help secure the next vote. Omer also said Karzai would name candidates for 11 vacant cabinet posts by a deadline of the middle of next week, imposed on Saturday by the lower house of parliament. "The rest of the cabinet members will be introduced to parliament as soon as possible and we will do that by the deadline specified by the parliament," said Omer. Karzai has left acting ministers in charge of nearly half the cabinet since January, when parliament twice rejected large numbers of his nomin
