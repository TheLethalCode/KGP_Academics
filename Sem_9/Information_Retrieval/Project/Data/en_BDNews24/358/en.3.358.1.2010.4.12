 LONDON, Apr 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Debt-crippled Portsmouth emerged from the maelstrom of a stormy season on Sunday to reach the FA Cup final with a shock 2-0 defeat of Tottenham Hotspur. The south coast club, who were relegated from the Premier League on Saturday and were rated 9-1 by bookmakers to beat Spurs, produced a display full of fight to reach the finale for the second time in three seasons having beaten Cardiff in 2008. Tottenham Hotspur were overwhelming favourites to set up a May 15 showdown with Chelsea but after 90 minutes of stalemate, goals from Frederic Piquionne and former Tottenham player Kevin-Prince Boateng sent Portsmouth's army of fans into raptures. Wembley's pitch, which came under fire on Saturday after Chelsea's 3-0 semi-final victory over Aston Villa, again proved a huge talking point as Portsmouth's opener came as a direct result of Spurs skipper Michael Dawson losing his footing. Tottenham also had reason to feel hard done by when Peter Crouch had a goal disallowed shortly after Piquionne's opener but the north London club could have few complaints about the result as Portsmouth showed more desire. Manager Harry Redknapp, who steered Portsmouth to victory at Wembley two years ago against Cardiff before leaving to join Tottenham, embraced his opposite number Avram Grant warmly at the final whistle before trudging off for the post-mortem. His side have just three days now to pick themselves up for a crucial Premier League match against Arsenal when defeat could wreck their hopes of finishing fourth. RELEGATION TURMOIL Of Portsmouth's starters on Sunday, only keeper David James began the Cup final in 2008, such has been the turmoil at the club which went into administration in February with debts of around 70 million pounds, triggering a nine-point deduction that virtually condemned them to relegation. Many of their players on Sunday are unlikely to be at the club next season but for 120 minutes they fought for the badge with a pride and passion that Tottenham did not match. Piquionne was a thorn in Tottenham's side all afternoon, twice breaking clear in the first half to force good saves from Tottenham keeper Heurelho Gomes. Tottenham improved after the break and Crouch, one of several players who jumped ship with Redknapp to White Hart Lane from Fratton Park, wasted several chances before being denied by an instinctive save by James in stoppage time. With the Pompey fans in full voice the decisive moment arrived nine minutes into extra time when a free kick was hoisted into the Spurs area. Dawson seemed poised to clear the knock down but his feet went from under him and he could only watch in horror as Piquionne, a player on loan from Lyon, pounced. Tottenham were stung into action and appeared to have equalised almost immediately when Crouch turned the ball in from close range but referee Alan Wiley ruled that Niko Kranjcar, a Cup winner with Portsmouth, had fouled James. The Pompey Chimes were in full cry with three minutes to go when Boateng beat Gomes from the penalty spot after Wilson Palacios brought down the marauding Aruna Dindane. Portsmouth are the first club to reach the FA Cup final in the same season as getting relegated since Middlesbrough also got through to face Chelsea in
