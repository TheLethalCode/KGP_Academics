 WARSAW, Apr 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A decision to bury Polish President Lech Kaczynski in the crypt of Wawel cathedral in Krakow, a place reserved for the nation's heroes, poets and kings, has sharply divided Poles days before the funeral. Kaczynski died in a plane crash in Russia on Saturday along with 95 other people including his wife Maria and many members of Poland's political and military elite. Cardinal Stanislaw Dziwisz said on Tuesday Kaczynski and his wife Maria would be buried at Wawel on Sunday following consultations with family members, including the president's twin brother Jaroslaw, who heads Poland's main opposition party. Numerous heads of state and government, including US President Barack Obama, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, are due to attend the funeral. "The decision to bury him in Wawel is hasty and emotional," said leading daily Gazeta Wyborcza in a front-page editorial. "It is inappropriate to demand that Lech Kaczynski after his death become the equal of Jozef Pilsudski, architect of Polish independence ... This decision will certainly divide Poles." Pilsudski helped Poland regain its independence in 1918 and dominated its politics through the 1920s and 1930s. Oscar-winning film director Andrzej Wajda also urged the church to reverse its decision, saying it risked sparking "the deepest divisions" in Poland since the end of communism in 1989. As the director of a film chronicling the massacre of Polish officers by Soviet forces in Katyn forest in 1940, Wajda's view carries moral weight. Kaczynski's plane had been heading on Saturday to Katyn to mark the 70th anniversary of the massacre. About 500 people staged a noisy protest in Krakow late on Tuesday against the decision, waving banners that read "Not Krakow, not Wawel" and "Are you sure he is the equal of kings?" Others joined protests on the social media site Facebook. By Wednesday, the "No to Kaczynski's burial in Wawel" group had attracted over 26,000 fans. Nearly 5,000 had joined a group bearing the ironic name "I want to be buried in Wawel too". FIRST CRACKS The protests were the first cracks in a display of national unity since the crash. Tens of thousands of mourners welcomed home Kaczynski's coffin and that of his wife. People were queuing in rain for hours on Wednesday to view the coffins in Warsaw's presidential palace. Lech Kaczynski, president since 2005, was a polarising figure whose support levels had fallen to about 20 percent before his death. He had been expected to lose a presidential election due in the autumn and now likely to be held in June. To his conservative admirers, Kaczynski was a patriot and man of deep moral and religious convictions. To his foes, he was a narrow-minded reactionary out of step with an increasingly liberal, outward-looking and European Poland. His supporters defended the decision to bury him at Wawel. "It's dangerous to fuel rows over the burial of the first couple," Witold Waszczykowski, one of the few Kaczynski aides not to die with him on Saturday, told Polish television. Wawel is a large complex of buildings on the Vistula River that includes a castle, cathedral and fortifications. The cathedral was the coronation site of virtually all of Poland's monarchs, and Wawel Castle was the centre of government for five centuries until the end of the 16th century. As well as Polish kings, the Wawel crypt also contains the bodies of legendary military commander Tadeusz Kosciuszko, who fought in the US war of independence, Poland's wartime leader Wladyslaw Sikorski and national poet Adam Mickiew
