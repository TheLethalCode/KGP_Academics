BACKGROUND The Bengali year was introduced during the regime of Emperor Akbar to facilitate revenue collection in the 16th century. Ameer Fateh Ullah Sirajee, member of Akbar's Nabaratna initiated the "crop year" by mixing the solar year with lunar year. It was Sirajee who began counting Bengali Nababarsha from Baishakh after combining Hizri with Bengali year. The name Baishakh was derived from a heavenly body named 'Bishakha.' However, in Bangladesh, the celebration was first shifted in 1988, following a coordinating committee recommendation. It suggested to observe the day on Apr 14, saying that it would be scientific, instead of following 'panjika'. The committee was formed under the supervision of the Bangla Academy in 1963. Veteran academician Dr Muhammad Shahidullah and Dr Meghnad Saha were among the top members. But, the West Bengal government did not accept that. The citizens there, most of whom are Bengali speakers, still follow the 'panjika'. bdn
