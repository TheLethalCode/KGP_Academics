<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 14 (bdnews24.com)At least 15 women were assaulted during a Pahela Baishakh concert on Dhaka University campus Wednesday evening. The police came to their aid as the women were reportedly harassed at and around the concert that had drawn a large crowd around the Raju Bhashkorjo to celebrate the Bengali New Year. Although the concert was set to end at 9pm, it was called off an hour early upon a request from the police, apparently because the situation was getting out of hand after dark. Krishnapada Roy, deputy commissioner of Ramna zone, told bdnews24.com that since there were no complaints, the police had not arrested anyone. "The police went to the spot upon hearing of harassment of women and made them go home." Witnesses said unruly youths harassed women at the concert which drew unexpectedly high number of spectators. ADC Nurul Islam of Ramna zone told reporters that the police helped the women get away after complaints of physical assault. Muktaban Shahitya Shangskritik Sangsad organised the concert. President of Bangladesh Chhatra League's Jasimuddin Hall unit, Abdur Rahman Jibon, is also the president of the Sangsad. "We stopped the programme as soon as the police asked us to," he told the bdnews24.com university correspondent. Earlier on Feb 21, some activists of the Chhatra League, the ruling Awami League's student wing, assaulted a woman on campus and severely beat up five of her friends who were accompanying her. bdnews24.com reported on Feb 21 that this female student had triggered the 'ire' of Jibon's cadres from Jasimuddin Hall when she refused to speak to them as they blocked her way. One of the Chhatra League activists identified as Shetu, of Jasimuddin Hall, by a witness, first approached the woman and began harassing her. They beat up her male companions when they protested. bdnews24.c
