<TITLE> ADB predicts a dismal FY 2010 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 13 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh is faring through a tough year, according to the ADB. If what the Asian Development Bank predicts is true, then this 2010 fiscal, ending in June, will perhaps be one of the most difficult in recent history. The annual Asian Development Outlook 2010 predicts the lowest GDP growth for Bangladesh in the last five years, with a sharply dipping remittance growth and a moderately high inflation. The silver lining is, however, that the next fiscal (2011), when the economy is expected to bounce back, is less than three months away. While some indicators are set to perform better in 2011, or at best by the second half of the 2010 fiscal, riding on the back of global recovery from the recession, Bangladesh's economy is set to fare through some hard times. The multilateral lending agency projected the country's growth at 5.5 percent in FY 2010 compared to 5.9 in 2009 with remittance growth set to fall to 16.5 percent and even further to 12.5 percent the next year. The GDP growth projection, as with experts and other lending agencies, has been steady at 5.5 percent except that of the government, which insists on a 6 percent growth. However, given the decelerating rate of workers going abroad  reflected by a negative remittance growth, tough export competition and a high inflation, the only saving grace appears to be the agriculture sector with a still impressive growth of 4.1 percent declining from 4.6 percent in 2009. The ADB's annual publication predicts a decline in the two other sectors besides agricultureindustry to 5.6 percent and services to 5.9 percent. Inflation is forecast to feature highly at 7.5 percent  with food inflation being the main trigger  and coupled with the low growth, 2010 fiscal is set to be dismal for a large section of the people. However, the following year's bounce-back is projected to be rather spectacular with "growth expected to rise to 6.3 percent, underpinned by the global recover and strengthened business confidence and investment" with inflation at 7.8 percent in 2011. Although remittance growth is projected to fall further, the domestic sectors are set to pick up and more than make up that loss. Exports are expected to "return to a positive growth path on recovering global momentum" in the second half of 2010. Investment in infrastructure along with availability of necessary utility services including gas, water and power are said to be one of the major drawbacks for the diversifying the country's RMG-dependent exports. The outlook states, "Recent experience underscores the urgency of diversifying into other promising industries such as ceramics, pharmaceuticals, food processing, leather products, and spare parts for machinery and shipbuilding." bdnew
