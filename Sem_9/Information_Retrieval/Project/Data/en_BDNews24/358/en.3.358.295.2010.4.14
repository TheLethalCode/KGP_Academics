<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 14 (bdnews24.com)The main opposition BNP on Wednesday demanded that magistrates be present at every voting centre in the Bhola-3 by-elections citing security issues. At a press conference on Wednesday the BNP office secretary Rizvi Ahmed presented five demands on behalf of his party's candidate. The other demands includedeployment of the army, establishing RAB camps in every union, the presence of an election commissioner in Lalmohon thana during the elections and taking measures against "outsider hooligans". BNP's Maj (retd) Hafizuddin Ahmed and Md Nurunnabi Chowdhury of the Awami League are set to run in the elections scheduled to be held on Apr 24. Earlier this month both candidates complained about each other in press conferences alleging that the other's supporters had attacked their meetings ahead of the elections. On Tuesday, a two-member delegation of the BNP had reiterated its demand for deploying the army when they met the chief election commissioner. The chief election commissioner had then assured the two leaders that they were taking the necessary actions to ensure a fair election, including deployment of RAB from Apr 16. The EC said that they will also appoint two observers in each upazila, while the CEC will visit the area on Apr 18, according to one of the two members of the delegation. Some two thousand outsiders from the nearby districts have entered the constituency to work for the AL candidate, Rizvi claimed. "We've already submitted the five-point demands to the EC, which has not taken any action. "They (EC) are watching the matter like the one-eyed devil from the Arabic folk tale. It's unfortunate," he added. Rizvi claimed that the AL candidate was violating election rules "one after the other" and that BNP would win the elections "if only a fair atmosphere was ensured'. bdn
