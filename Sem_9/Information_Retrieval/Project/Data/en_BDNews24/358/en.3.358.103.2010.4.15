 LONDON, Apr 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A new era in British politics begins on Thursday with the first televised debate between the main candidates for prime minister. With a national election due on a May 6, millions of voters are still undecided and the 90-minute live broadcast may inject some drama into a tightly controlled campaign that has so far struggled to capture the public's imagination. "I can't pretend I'm not nervous," said David Cameron, leader of the centre-right opposition Conservatives, speaking on BBC television on Wednesday. He is fighting to lead his party back into power after 13 years in opposition. Cameron will hope to land a knock-out blow on British Prime Minister Gordon Brown of the centre-left Labour Party, which has come back into contention after trailing the Conservatives in the opinion polls by a double-digit margin for much of last year. The debate will cover domestic affairs, with two more to follow on international issues and economic policy. The novelty factor means the first one will get most attention, with any gaffes or witty lines sure to be replayed countless times before May 6. A ComRes poll conducted this week found that more than 60 percent of British adults planned to watch the debate. Of those, half said it might influence how they vote. "This is going to be the biggest night of David Cameron's career," said Andrew Hawkins, chief executive of ComRes. The Conservatives' opinion poll lead over Labour has shrunk to single digits since the start of 2010. Most polls now suggest no party will win an overall majority of seats in the lower house of parliament, an outcome not seen in Britain since 1974. Two polls published on Thursday showed the Conservatives had extended their lead over Labour. The daily YouGov poll in the Sun tabloid put the Conservatives on 41 percent, their highest rating since the start of the campaign, to Labour's 32 percent. A ComRes survey for the Independent/ITV News showed a marginal rise in the Conservatives' lead to six points. "RADIO FACE" If that happens, it may fall to the third-biggest party, the Liberal Democrats, to determine who will govern by forming an alliance with the Conservatives or with Labour. The Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, will take part in the three televised debates, giving him a rare chance to stand on an equal footing with Cameron and Brown. "I just hope they don't hold back. People want to know more about their political leaders. I hope they don't disappoint by sticking to stock formulaic answers but really let loose on saying who they are," said Hawkins of ComRes. Cameron, 43, is widely considered the best performer of the three. A former public relations executive for a television firm, he has youthful looks, a quick wit and an ability to speak fluently without notes. Labour's line of attack is that he is a novice who offers a slick style but little substance. The austere Brown, 59, was finance minister for 10 years before taking over as prime minister from Tony Blair in 2007. This is the first time he is leading Labour into an election. Brown portrays himself as a heavyweight economic manager, while Cameron blames him for the worst recession in decades. A plodding orator, Brown has said his strength lies more in mastery of policy detail than in presentation. A former Labour leader, Neil Kinnock, said this week Brown had "a radio face". Low expectations of Brown may work in the prime minister's favour since there will be more scope for him to create a positive surprise, while Cameron's good presentational skills are known to voters and do not help outweigh Brown's experience. The fresh-faced Clegg, 43, struggles to make an impact and is often overshadowed by his popular economic policy chief, Vince Cable. The Liberal Democrats' campaign bus is adorned with both men's fa
