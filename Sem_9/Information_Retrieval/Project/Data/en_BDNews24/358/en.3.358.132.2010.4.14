 BISHKEK, Apr 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States said on Wednesday it was prepared to help Kyrgyzstan's new rulers, putting pressure on ousted president Kurmanbek Bakiyev, who hinted he may attempt to go into exile. The unrest has disrupted flights from the Kyrgyz air base that the United States rents to support the war in Afghanistan. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev warned that the poor Central Asian state may be on the brink of civil war. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Blake, the most senior US official to visit Bishkek since the April 7 uprising, when troops opened fire on protesters, said he was "optimistic" about the steps taken by the new leadership that ousted Bakiyev. "The United States is prepared to help," Blake said after meeting the interim Kyrgyz government leader, Roza Otunbayeva. Otunbayeva said she and Blake did not discuss the US base. But in a sign of the big power rivalries in the region, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin approved a $50 million aid and loan package for Kyrgyzstan just hours after Blake's meeting. Otunbayeva called for Bakiyev to be put on trial for his part in the deaths of at least 84 people during the uprising. Another 1,600 people were injured and many remain in hospital. "If we get our hands on Bakiyev, then he will be put on trial," she said. "He has already had his chance to leave." Bakiyev denies ordering troops to fire into the crowds, but his brother Zhanybek Bakiyev, chief of the presidential bodyguard, has admitted doing so. U.S. CONCERNS Washington is concerned the crisis will affect its five-year lease deal with Kyrgyzstan for use of the Manas air base. After last week's upheaval, some members of the interim government had suggested the lease would be shortened to please Moscow. Russia also has an air base in Kyrgyzstan and has sought to evict U.S. interests from Central Asia, a formerly Soviet-ruled region between China, Afghanistan and the Caspian Sea. The interim government says it will abide by its agreements on Manas, but the pro-Russian sympathies of some senior ministers have given rise to suspicions the Kremlin may try to use the base as a lever in its relations with Washington. Medvedev suggested Bakiyev should formally step down to defuse a crisis that could develop into a "second Afghanistan". "As I understand it, Kyrgyzstan is on the verge of civil war," Medvedev told an audience at a think tank in Washington, where he was attending the global nuclear security summit. Putin approved the aid package to Kyrgyzstan after members of his government met Otunbayeva's deputy, Almazbek Atambayev. This was only a third of the $150 million Atambayev had said he would request, though Putin said the package could be increased. "The provisional government says the coffers are bare, that the old leadership stole the lot," said Putin, who was the first senior foreign official to call Otunbayeva after the uprising. "We must support our friends," he said. Bakiyev hinted on Wednesday, after the interim government threatened to send forces to arrest him, that he might leave if the government guaranteed his safety and that of his family. BAKIYEV EXILE? "I am not clutching at my armchair and I have not said that I am not going to step down under any circumstances," Bakiyev told reporters in his home village in southern Kyrgyzstan. "If the issues of my personal safety and the safety of my family members are resolved ... and if there is stability in Kyrgyzstan, then I am ready to consider this question," he said. But a source in the interim defence ministry, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he would not be able to leave: "He doesn't have any airplanes and all the borders are closed." A group of human rights activists who met Bakiyev said the president was ready for a peaceful handover of power. "He looked depressed. He had a tragic feel about him. He looked tired," Aziza Abdirasulova, a rights campaigner who flew to meet Bakiyev in his village, told Reuters by telephone. "He understands how tragic the situation is, that he has no right to remain president." Bakiyev's change of tone, after days of defiance and hints of conflict, could open a way out of the turmoil, though fears of ethnic strife reared their head on Wednesday in the southern city of Jalalabad, where Bakiyev has much of his support. At least 2,000 ethnic Uzbeks massed on the central square to protest against Bakiyev, but were drowned out by about 1,000 ethnic Kyrgyz Bakiyev supporters rallying at the same square. "I feel something is being cooked up. I feel that something bad is in the air," said Muradillo, a 34-year-old Uzbek musician in Jalalabad, who gave only his first name for safety reasons. Jalalabad is in the Ferghana Valley, a cauldron of ethnic and tribal tension in the heart of Central Asia that was the scene of violent clashes in the last days of the Soviet Union. Uzbeks in the region demanded autonomy from the Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan, provoking a backlash that killed at least 300 peo
