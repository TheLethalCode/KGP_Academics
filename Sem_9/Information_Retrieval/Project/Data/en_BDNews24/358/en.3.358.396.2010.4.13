 Chittagong, Apr 13 (bdnews24.com)  A top leader of Jamaat-e-Islami admitted on Tuesday that the party was opposed to the independence of Bangladesh in 1971. "Jamaat-e-Islami leaders, as Pakistani citizens, opposed those fighting for independence in 1971," said Chittagong Metropolitan Jamaat chief Shamsul Islam MP. He, however, said that, "The party did nothing to counteract the sovereignty of Bangladesh after it became independent," he said. The Jamaat leader was speaking to reporters at a briefing called to express the party's reaction to the police decision of preventing it from holding a public meeting on Apr 11. When asked whether Jamaat's role in 1971 was wrong, Islam said that the matter should be discussed. "It's not right to term anyone as war criminal prior to the investigation." Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed, Jamaat's secretary general, has in recent times faced difficulties in holding party programmes in different parts of the country as many people allege that he is a war criminal. Chittagong is the latest of such incidents where on Apr 11 Mojaheed had to return to Dhaka, failing to hold a party meeting not only in the scheduled place, but also at its Chittagong office. Asked whether these obstructions resulted from Mojaheed's controversial role in the Liberation War, Islam said that Motiur Rahman Nizami and Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed did not do any misdeeds in 1971. "If anyone makes such allegations, we will take them to the court." Referring to the combined movement with Awami League in 1996 against the then BNP government, he said, "If we were not criminals then, how come we have become criminals now?" In a written statement, the Jamaat leader accused the government of staging a 39-year old farce in the name of trying war criminals. Islam criticised the government for completely failing to resolve the water, power and gas crises and to control the price hike of essentials. He also said that the golden boys (AL activists belonging to the party's student and youth wings) of Awami League have done nothing but tender-mongering, extortion and terrorism. Later, the Jamaat leader declared a five-day long protest programme including exchanging greetings with the mass people on Apr 14, sharing opinion with the leaders on Apr 15, protest rallies at upazila-level on Apr 16 and Apr 17 and 'Bhat Chai, Kaj Chai' (We want food, work) movement on Apr 17. Metropolitan Nayeb-e-Amir, Afsar Uddin Chowdhury, assistant secretary general AJM Obaidullah and other Chittagong party leaders were also present at the briefing. bd
