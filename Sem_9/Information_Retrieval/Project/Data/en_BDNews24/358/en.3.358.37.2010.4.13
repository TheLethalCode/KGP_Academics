 Pabna, Apr 13 (bdnews24.com)  Two factions of the opposition BNP clashed in Pabna on Tuesday following the court appearance of Zainul Abdin Farroque, the opposition chief whip. Farroque obtained bail from the Pabna court on Tuesday morning in relation to a defamation case filed against him on Mar 18. Local BNP leaders and activists thronged the court premises following the appearance of Farroque, who is also publicity secretary of the party. As he left the court, the followers of district BNP general secretary Habibor Rahman Tota and supporters of former organising secretary Kamrul Hassan Minto chanted slogans against each other. At one stage both the groups clashed with each other, injuring at least 20 people. Police arrived at the scene and dispersed the two groups. BNP leader Tota told bdnews24.com that Minto's supporters had organised an attack on his followers with the aid of the ruling Awami League. Minto was not available for comment. About a dozen cases have been filed against Farroque in different districts on charges of making defamatory allegations about the prime minister's son's role in the illegal VoIP business. Farroque had previously sought bail from the High Court but the court has instructed him to surrender to the trial court. bd
