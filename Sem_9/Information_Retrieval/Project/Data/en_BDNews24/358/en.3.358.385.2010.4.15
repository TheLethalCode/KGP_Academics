<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 15 (bdnews24.com)  The government has filed an application to appeal the High Court ruling declaring the CHT Regional Council Act unconstitutional. The government is also seeking an order to stay the decision until the appeal has been heard. The application was filed in the Appellate Division on Thursday morning. Additional attorney general Murad Reza told bdnews24.com that the hearing will take place at the bench of the chamber judge Md Mozammel Hossain later in the day. The High Court on Tuesday ruled that the CHT Regional Council Act of 1998 was unconstitutional. Although the court ruled that it did not have jurisdiction to consider whether or not the CHT Peace Accord itself was lawful, formation of the Regional Council was an intrinsic part of the Accord. The court held that the 1997 Accord must now be read together with its decision on the illegality of the 1998 Act. This means, in effect, that the part of the Accord dealing with the Regional Council now has no legal effect. bd
