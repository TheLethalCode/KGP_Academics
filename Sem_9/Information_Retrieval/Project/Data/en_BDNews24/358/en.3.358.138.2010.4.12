 BANGKOK, Apr 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thailand's army chief called on Monday for early elections, adding to pressure on Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva whose party may face prosecution over funding activities. The call came after weekend protests left 21 dead and 800 injured and although there was no violence on Monday, protesters circled the capital and still occupied their bases in Bangkok, one near a major shopping centre. "The current issue now is about dissolution of parliament, so my understanding is we just need to dissolve the House. But how long it will take before the house dissolution, that depends on the result of the negotiations," Thai army chief Anupong Paochinda told a news conference. Abhisit himself has said he could dissolve parliament by the year-end, a move that has not satisfied "red shirt" protesters, supporters of former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, who want him to quit immediately and leave the country. Thailand's Election Commission added to pressure on Abhisit when it ruled that his Democrats Party could face prosecution over funding irregularities, cheering anti-government protesters who marched in Bangkok after a weekend of violence. Although the proceedings in the Supreme Court could take months, if a prosecution is launched, a similar measure was used to oust the government backed by Thaksin in 2008. "Red shirt brothers are celebrating because this could lead to the end of the Democrats Party," activist Mattawut Saikua told reporters as tens of thousands chanted "Abhisit, get out." The weekend protests triggered a selloff on Thailand's stock market and the prospect of further political uncertainty and more violence shocked investors who had pushed billions of dollars into Thailand. "Till a week ago we were very bullish on Thailand," Piyush Gupta, Chief Executive Officer of DBS, Southeast Asia's largest bank, said in Singapore. "After the weekend, bets are off." Abhisit himself offered few clues as to how he would resolve the five-year-old crisis that has pitted Thailand's rural poor, many of whom support ex-premier Thaksin Shinawatra, ousted in a 2006 coup, against the metropolitan elite. The mood among the thousands of protesters, circling the city on trucks, scooters and "tuk-tuk" taxis, remained defiant. Abhisit, in a televised news conference, termed some of the protesters "terrorists, using their innocent fellow citizens who came to call for democracy, to incite unrest to bring a significant change in the country". EARLIER ELECTIONS? The Bangkok Post daily, citing unnamed sources, said Abhisit could dissolve parliament in six months, three months sooner than his most recent proposal. He has in any case to call an election by end-2011. Many senior officers are averse to allowing Thaksin's supporters back into power, but many in the ranks who come from the same poor groups as the red shirts sympathise with them. Saturday's fighting, some of it in well-known Bangkok tourist areas, ended after security forces pulled back late in the night. The capital has since been calm, while authorities ponder whether to renew a potentially bloody crackdown on the month-long protests or make some concession to demands for fresh po
