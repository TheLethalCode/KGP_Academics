 HONG KONG,Apr 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Violent protests in Bangkok which killed 21 people at the weekend could fuel further political instability in Thailand and does not augur well for its credit rating, a Standard & Poor's (S&P) analyst said on Monday. Rival Fitch Ratings and Thailand's central bank governor also expressed concerns that the country's sovereign credit rating could be at risk from the growing political turmoil. Thousands of anti-government protesters are still on the streets of Bangkok and in a defiant mood after the army failed to move them on Saturday from an area where they have camped out for a month. The clashes between security forces and protesters, the worst political violence in the country since 1992, drove Thai stocks down 5 percent to a four-week low on Monday while the cost of insuring Thai debt jumped. "The current negative outlook captures the underlying political tensions, although the latest clashes in Bangkok suggest there could be further deterioration in political stability," said Kim Eng Tan, sovereign analyst at S&P. "The latest developments do not appear to argue for restoration of a stable outlook," he told Reuters. Last April, S&P lowered Thailand's domestic currency rating to A-minus from A and kept its outlook on negative. The agency also has a negative outlook on Thailand's BBB-plus foreign currency rating. Tan said the street protests of the recent past were often diffused by a change in government, but this time the government appeared likely to retain power in the near term, resisting protesters' demands to step down. Thailand's government is expecting to post a budget deficit of 3.8 percent of gross domestic product this year, more than double that of Indonesia, after posting a deficit of over 5 percent of GDP in its fiscal year to October 2009. A sharp drop in tourism revenues as a result of the clashes, or a sudden exodus of foreign investors would add to the fiscal pressures facing the government even as the economy tries to shake off the lingering impact of the global financial crisis. Thailand, along with other Southeast Asian economies, has seen foreign capital surge into its markets in recent months on the region's strong economic growth prospects. Fitch said it was "particularly concerned" about Thailand's local currency rating. "We expect a deterioration in public finances of Thailand, given the escalated political uncertainty ...," Vincent Ho, associate director of Fitch's Asia Sovereign ratings, told Reuters. Fitch rates Thailand's foreign currency debt as "BBB" with a stable outlook while the local currency is rated "A-minus" with a stable outlook. Ho said it was too early to say if Fitch would change is outlook or ratings on Thailand as the current political situation was "fluid", but he doubted a snap election would end the political deadlock. Financial markets have turned jittery after weeks of largely peaceful protests turned violent. Thailand's five-year credit default swaps (CDS), which reflect the cost of insuring its debt from default or severe deterioration, moved out to trade at its widest in 7 weeks. Asked if Thai ratings faced the possibility of being downgraded, Bank of Thailand Governor Tarisa Watanagase told reporters: "Yes, there is a risk and if that happens, it will affect borrowing costs in the private sector." "So far we have not seen a serious decline in foreign direct investments but increasingly people will be worried about political tensions spilling over into areas of affecting their long term investments," said S&P's Tan. Foreign investors were net sellers of 1.76 billion baht ($54.6 million) of stock on Friday, their second straight day of net selling, reducing their purchases since Feb. 22 to 55.73 billion baht ($1.73 billion). Foreigners had bought $1.8 billion in Thai stocks from Feb. 22 until Thursday. The recent foreign buying of Thai stocks was spurred by cheap valuations and a recovery in the econ
