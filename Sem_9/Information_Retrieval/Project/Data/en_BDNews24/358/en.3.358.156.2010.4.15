<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 15 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court's rejection of two writ petitions has cleared the way for ACC to proceed against Bashundhara boss Ahmed Akbar Sobhan (Shah Alam). The High Court on Thursday rejected two petitions filed by Bashundhara Group chairman Shah Alam, challenging legality of proceedings of a corruption case against him. The bench of justices Md Imman Ali and Obaidul Hasan gave the rule on the ground that the petitions were filed when Sobhan was an absconder. Sobhan's name was not mentioned in the case filed by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) on Mar 29, 2007 with the Motijheel Police Station. The commission filed it against former housing minister Mirza Abbas and 11 others accusing them of corruption in the sale of 18 abandoned government houses. But Sobhan was implicated in the case when the commission investigator submitted the chargesheet. He was accused of purchasing the houses at a low price and selling two of them to two persons loyal to Abbas under a previous arrangement. The chargesheet mentioned that the low-price sale had caused Tk 127.64 crore loss to the government. Head of a top business conglomerate, Shah Alam, had filed two petitions challenging the legality of the case. The court had issued a rule upon the government following the petitions. Advocate Abdul Aziz Khan stood for the ACC during Thursday's hearing, but Alam was not represented by anyone. Following the rule, the ACC lawyer told journalists that the petitions were filed when the Bashundhara chief was in hiding. "The court rejected them on the grounds that no absconder has the right to file such petitions," he said. The lawyer said the rejection would clear the path of proceeding with the case at the trial court.
