 Thakurgaon, Apr 12 (bdnews24.com)  A special court in Thakurgaon convicted 50 and acquitted one for border guards' mutiny in 2009. In the second verdict relating to the BDR mutiny where riflesmen in Thakurgaon rebelled in support of their comrades in Pilkhana, Dhaka on Feb 25-26 last year, two border guards were given the maximum penalty of seven years of rigorous imprisonment. All the convicted BDR personnel belong to 20 Rifles Battalion. BDR director general, Major General Mainul Islam, head of the three-member court, delivered the verdict. A total of 33 people testified in the case. Charges were pressed against 51 accused last week. Of them 44 admitted their involvement in the mutiny. The special court-2 in Thakurgaon began trial on Feb 3. It was adjourned on Feb 5. The court resumed on Apr 8. The Panchagarh special BDR court on Apr 7 became the first to issue verdict among the six special courts across the country trying the BDR mutineers. Twenty-nine members of the 25th Rifles Battalion have been accused of rebellion in support of the massacre at the BDR Pilkhana headquarters on Feb 25 and 26 last year. The Pilkhana mutiny saw over 70 people killed, nearly 60 of them army officers deputed to the border force. Rebellion spread to other BDR outposts around the country. On November 15, the government formed six special courts, including two in Dhaka, to try about 3,500 border guards accused in 40 cases around the country. The six special courts are trying charges of mutiny, looting and arson. The Pilkhana murders will be tried separately in civilian courts. The BDR members at Thakurgaon are accused of rebellion in support of the Pilkhana mutiny. In the event of a guilty verdict, the maximum penalty for rebellion under the BDR Act is seven years in jail. Special BDR courts in Rangamati, Satkhira and Feni have also set verdict dates for ongoing trials. Verdicts in the trial of 19th Rifles Battalion in Feni will be given on Apr 18; of 7th Rifles Battalion of Satkhira on Apr 19; and of Rajnagar Battalion of Rangamati on May 2. bdne
