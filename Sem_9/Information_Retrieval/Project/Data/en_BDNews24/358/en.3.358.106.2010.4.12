 MADRID, Apr 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid will push for maximum points from their remaining seven La Liga matches but know that unless leaders Barcelona slip up there is no chance of silverware coming to the Bernabeu this season. Barca's emphatic 2-0 victory in Saturday's 'Clasico' in Madrid put them top with 80 points from 31 matches, three ahead of Real, and the champions also hold the head-to-head record between the sides should they finish level on points. Real coach Manuel Pellegrini has to lift his players for the trip to Almeria on Thursday (1800 GMT) with local media openly discussing his possible replacement, while Madrid fans worry about a collapse along the lines of last season. Under Juande Ramos, Real were on an 18-match unbeaten run before they lost 6-2 to Barca at the Bernabeu and then fell apart, losing their four remaining matches.

"But it's only three points and there is a huge amount of work in front of us and difficult games." Coach Pep Guardiola could have Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic back after injury. Deportivo have struggled of late and dropped out of contention for the European places down to ninth, having gone six matches without a win. Third-placed Valencia, who are 21 points adrift of Real, can strengthen their hold on Spain's last automatic Champions League qualification slot with a victory at home to Athletic Bilbao on Thursday (2000). Bilbao have climbed to sixth and are three points behind Real Mallorca in fifth and Sevilla in fourth. Mallorca visit struggling Real Zaragoza on Wednesday (1800) and Sevilla are away to relegation-threatened Real Valladolid on Tuesday (1
