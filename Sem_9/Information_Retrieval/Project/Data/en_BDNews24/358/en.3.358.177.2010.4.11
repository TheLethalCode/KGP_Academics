 Dhaka, Apr 11 (bdnews24.com) -- Kings XI Punjab put up a comprehensive show to beat the Delhi Daredevils by seven wickets in their return-leg Indian Premier League match at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium in New Delhi on Sunday, reports PTI. Earlier, Irfan Pathan returned with a three-wicket haul as Kings XI put up disciplined bowling and fielding effort to shoot out Delhi Daredevils for a lowly 111. Piyush Chawla (2/16) and Irfan Pathan (3/24) scalped five wickets between them, while Yuvraj Singh and Love Ablish accounted for one each as Delhi suffered a batting capitulation after skipper Gautam Gambhir elected to bat. Delhi never looked in their elements and the much-famed batting line collapsed like a house of cards, losing half their side in exactly 10 overs with just 63 on board, before folding for the lowest total in Delhi in IPL. David Warner (6) had started the innings on a positive note when he welcomed Ramesh Powar with a four in the first ball but Pathan removed Virender Sehwag for a duck in the first ball of the next over to dealt the first blow to Delhi. New man Gambhir (26), however, was unperturbed as he milked Pathan for three fours in the next four balls before slamming Ablish for consecutive boundaries. But some brilliant piece of fielding by Punjab affected two crucial run-outs to reduce Delhi to 41 for three in 4.1 overs. The quick reflex of wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara did Gambhir in as the Delhi skipper succumbed to his third successive run out in IPL III in fourth over. Just one ball later, Sangakkara and Karan Goel joined hands to remove Warner in the first ball of the fifth over. Paul Collingwood (4) and Dinesh Karthik (17) then added 14 runs out Chawla struck twice, dismissing the former and newman Daniel Vettori (2) as Delhi lost half of their side for 63 in 10 overs. Karthik also couldn't stay long and was sent packing by Pathan in the 14th over when he was caught at long-on by Mahela Jayawardene. Yuvraj then registered his first wicket in IPL 3 when Rajat Bhatia's leading edge flew to the point area with Reetinder Sodhi completing a brilliant running catch. Back into the attack, Ablish then picked up his first wicket of the day cleaning up Farveez Maharoof's middle stumps to reduce Delhi to 82 for eight in 15.1 overs. With just two more wickets in hand, Mithun Manhas and Amit Mishra picked up ones and twos and occasional fours to take Delhi across the 100-run mark, before the former was bowled by Jaun Theron in the 19th over. Ashish Nehra was the last to go when he was caught at the boundary line by Chawla as Pathan completed his consecutive three-wicket
