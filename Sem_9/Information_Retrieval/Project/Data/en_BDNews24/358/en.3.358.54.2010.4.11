<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 11 (bdnews24.com)  Counsels of former BNP state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar on Sunday said they would request the High Court for withdrawal of a tax evasion case filed against him. Charge framing against Babar was delayed for the second time on Sunday as his lawyers sought more time and requested the judge to adjourn activities of the day. Judge Nasir Uddin Mahmud of Dhaka Special Judges' court-5 granted a request to fix a fresh date for the charge framing and set it on May 25. Syed Zakir Hossain, deputy tax commissioner of tax zone-3 of company circle-3, on behalf of the National Board of Revenue, filed the case on Feb 14 this year. Babar's lawyer Sharfuddin Ahmed on Mar 11, the first date of charge framing, pleaded for more time saying that he had not received the necessary documents to prepare. The accused is currently behind bars serving 17 years in an arms case. He has also been shown arrested in the Aug 2004 grenade attack case and the Kibria murder case. The complaint says that the former state minister, as a director of Master Electronics Industry Limited, concealed income of around Tk 8.6 crore in 1999-2000 and 2008-2009. bdnew
