 Dhaka, Apr 11 (bdnews24.com)  Bashundhara chairman Ahmed Akbar Sobhan (Shah Alam) was quizzed at the Detective Branch office for almost 2 hours on Sunday night. He was asked to report to the police for interrogation about the murder of Ahmed Hossain, a ward commissioner from Old Dhaka. Shah Alam entered the DB offices at 10.25pm and left at 12.24pm. The police quizzed the Bashundhara chief to verify some information that had surfaced during the course of the investigation. Ahmed Hossain, commissioner of ward 70, was shot dead on Feb 9 at Alubazar, in front of Bara Masjid. The police arrested one Shahidul Islam Biddyut, a collector for one 'Dakat Shahid'  robber Shahid  on Mar 28 in connection with the killing. The police arrested the main shooter Kawser Ahmed and Shubhadda Union chairman, Md Nazimuddin, on the basis of Bidyut's confession. An assistant commissioner of the detective police, requesting anonymity, told bdnews24.com that Nazimuddin had divulged some important information. According to Nazimuddin, the ward commissioner, his two brothers and Nazimuddin were associated with Pak Bangla Manufacturing Industries, which produced gas cylinder and melamine. When the factory faced financial difficulties, they began considering to sell the industrial unit. At this point, Nazimuddin contacted Shah Alam to sell the factory in 2005 upon which Shah Alam inspected the factory and proposed to buy it. But according to the police detective, quoting Nazimuddin, Ahmed Hossain was against the decision. On Mar 29, a day after arresting the three persons, police commissioner told reporters at the detective police head quarters that Ahmed's murder was linked to money. "We found no political connection in this murder," he had said on that day. Biddyut told that briefing that Nazimuddin had given Shahid Tk 40 lakh for killing Ahmed Hossain. "Subsequently he ordered the murder of the commissioner," he said. A High Court bench of justices AHM Shamsuddin Chowdhury and Delwar Hossain on Apr 7 refused stay a police order for Shah Alam to appear for questioning on Apr 11. The court said that the Bashundhara boss must not tortured physically or mentally during questioning. It also ordered interrogators not to ask any question, answer to which might subsequently be used against him in the case. bd
