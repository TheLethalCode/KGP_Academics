<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 12 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has assured upazila chairmen that they will have responsibility for development activities and the maintenance of law and order in their upazila. Hasina, however, warned them not to indulge in criminal activities, "Otherwise none will be spared." She said the government would immediately distribute responsibilities among the MPs, upazila chairmen, vice chairmen and upazila nirbahi officers (UNO). "We will fix the activities in a regulation within a few days." At the meeting, the upazila chairmen expressed their grievances to the prime minister. Bodiuzzaman Badsha, a chairman of Sherpur's Nalitabari upazila, alleged that MPs showed a patronising attitude towards them. Upazila chairmen have had no work for the last 14 months, he said. Harun-or-Rashid, another chairman of Patuakhali's Dumki upazila alleged that the chairmen did not get appropriate respect from the UNOs. In response, the prime minister asked the upazila chairmen to work for people instead of complaining. She also asked them to make plans for the development of their upazilas. Hasina handed each upazila chairman a laptop which could connect to the internet. Local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam, who also attended the programme, said that the upazila parishad system will find success through concerted effort. "All should work together to ensure that the upazila parishad forms part of a strong local government sector," he said.
