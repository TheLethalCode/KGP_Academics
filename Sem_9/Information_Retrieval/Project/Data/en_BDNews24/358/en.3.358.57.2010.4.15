<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 15 (bdnews24.com)--- The High Court has issued a contempt of court notice against Moulvibazar district's deputy commissioner Md Mofizul Islam. The court on Thursday ordered Islam to appear in the court in person and explain why a charge of contempt should not be brought against him. The HC bench of justices AHM Shamsuddin Chowdhury and Delwar Hossain issued the rule following a petition filed by Kamalganj municipality mayor Hasin Afroz Chowdhury. Chowdhury had told the court that despite High Court orders of Nov 2, 2009 and Feb 18, 2010 requiring the Moulivibazar DC and other relevant people to allow him to carry out his responsibility as mayor, he had been prevented from carrying out his duty. Advocate SM Rezaul Karim moved the petition for Hasin. bdnew
