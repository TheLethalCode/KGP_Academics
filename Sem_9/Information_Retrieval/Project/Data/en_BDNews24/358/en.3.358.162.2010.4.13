 Dhaka, Apr 13 (bdnews24.com) -- The government is investigating allegations against over 100 hajj management agencies and will take tough actions against those found guilty. Kamaluddin Ahmed, acting additional secretary of religious affairs ministry said Tuesday that there were allegations against 107 hajj agencies. The religious affairs ministry has already cancelled the licence of one agency and investigation against 106 others are close to completion, he said. "Tough action will be taken if the allegations are true." Replying to a question by bdnews24.com correspondent during a press conference convened to announce the hajj package, he said despite probably actions, including licence cancellation, the ministry would not give any new licences. Fifty-eight persons could not perform hajj even after depositing money due to mismanagement by a number of agencies last year, when 50,280 pilgrims went to the world's largest Muslim congregation under private firms, and 8,209 under government management. In total there are 250 government approved hajj agencies in the country. Kamaluddin told the press conference that 75,000 pilgrims would be sent for hajj  60,000 under private and 15,000 under government management. This year every pilgrim will have to pay Tk 226,615. Last session, the pilgrims under government management had to pay Tk 220,550, which included Tk 8,000 for purchase of sacrificial animal. But this session, the pilgrims have to pay the price of sacrificial animals separately. The official said that this year hajj charges had been raised to meet the increased airfare and house rent. He said the private agencies would not be allowed to announce more than two packages, which would have to be finalised after signing deals with the government. Kamaluddin said persons wishing to perform hajj this year would have to deposit fees by June 22. Hajj agencies have been asked to submit the list of their pilgrims, along with their phone numbers, to the government by that time. The government's hajj management office will send the list of the pilgrims to the department concerned by June 25 for police clearance and health check-up, the official said. To a question on hajj journey by sea as planned by the shipping ministry, Kamaluddin said: "We're not thinking of this right now. And Saudi Arabian government is not accommodating the maritime route either."
