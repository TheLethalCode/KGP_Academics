 Dhaka, Apr 11 (bdnews24.com) Former Pakistan captains Inzamam-ul-Haq and Moin Khan have backed the idea of playing Test cricket under light and in colour clothing, saying everything should be done to make the format marketable, reports PTI. Inzamam, Pakistan's most capped player with over 300 one-dayers and 120 Test appearances, said there was nothing wrong in giving Test cricket a makeover. "Why not? Especially when the other two formats of the sport are being played under lights and in coloured clothing with white balls, why cannot the Test cricket format also be given a tweak?" he said. The International Cricket Council is studying various options on how to turn Test cricket into a more marketable venture. Former Australia captain Steve Waugh last week supported the idea of having Test matches under lights, in coloured clothing and with a pink ball. Inzamam said for Test cricket, the demand of the time is to undergo certain changes. "The biggest advantage of having day-and-night Tests is that you allow people to come to the grounds in their off-time and also you attract a wider television audience because of the prime timings," Inzamam explained. "Obviously they are issues with the kind of cricket ball that can be used for Tests under lights, how some rules can be readjusted but these are issues that will eventually be resolved," he said. He pointed out that when Kerry Packer first introduced day and night cricket with coloured clothing it was ridiculed and the purists had mourned the death of traditional cricket. "But today one-day cricket survives and despite the growing popularity of T20, Test cricket still has its fair share of fans. Every sport has to go some changes to survive. Nowadays people don't have time to sit through five days of cricket," he said. Moin Khan said he always enjoyed playing Test matches but agreed that changing times demanded for administrators to review the format of the five day game. "If it is possible to play day and night Tests, why not. There is nothing wrong with that. The officials just have to ensure that the pink ball they are planning to use in the longer version of the game is acceptable to all countries," Moin said. He said the growing popularity of T20 has left ICC and its member boards with a challenge to ensure that sponsors' money was equally available for Test matches as well. "Broadcasting companies must be convinced to ensure proper slots for Test matches. And if this can be done by having Tests under lights, why not?" he
