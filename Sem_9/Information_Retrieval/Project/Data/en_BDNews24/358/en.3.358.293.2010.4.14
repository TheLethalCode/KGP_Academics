 JOHANNESBURG, Apr 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters Life!) - As the World Cup approaches, South Africa's soccer grannies are working to fulfil their own dream -- competing for glory in America. The 35 women, aged 50 to 84, play for a team called Vakhegula Vakhegula or Grannies, Grannies in the Xitsonga language of northern South Africa.

Ntsanwisi said they had raised 130,000 rand ($17,900) so far but need 500,000 rand to make the trip to America for a tournament that starts two days after the end of the month-long World Cup, the first to be held in Africa. Whatever happens, however, the grannies have no regrets, saying playing football, often in their aprons after domestic work, has changed their lives. Onica Ndzovela, 77, suffered back pain and sore knees before joining the team three years ago. "I am fresh, I don't feel any pain in my body, I can run. At home I do all the housework by myself. I paint the walls and fit tiles," said defender Ndzo
