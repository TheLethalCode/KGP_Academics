 Dhaka, Apr 15 (bdnews24.com)  Major General Rafiqul Islam, currently the head of the auxiliary force, Bangladesh Ansar, has been appointed the new head of the border guard, the Bangladesh Rifles. A circular, issued by the establishment ministry, on Thursday announced the appointment of the new director general of the BDR. The outgoing BDR DG, Maj Gen Mainul Islam, was appointed as the head of the border guards after his predecessor Shakil Ahmed was killed in the bloody rebellion. Currently, special BDR courts around the country are hearing mutiny cases relating to the rebellion of the riflesmen on Feb 25-26 in 2009 in Pilkhana. Islam was heading the panel of judges in the six special courts. The rebellion at Pilkhana, Dhaka, the BDR headquarters, left about 70 people dead including 57 army officers, who were deputed to the BDR. Two special BDR courts in Panchagarh and Thakurgaon handed down verdicts this month and the four others have set the dates for verdict. The Thakurgaon court on Apr 12 convicted 50 mutineers and acquitted one. The Panchagarh court on Apr 7 convicted 29 BDR members. In both cases the convicted were found guilty of rebellion in support of the Pilkhana mutineers. Special BDR courts in Rangamati, Satkhira and Feni have also set verdict dates for ongoing trials. Verdicts in the trial of 19th Rifles Battalion in Feni will be given on Apr 18; of 7th Rifles Battalion in Satkhira on Apr 19; and of Rajnagar Battalion of Rangamati on May 2.
