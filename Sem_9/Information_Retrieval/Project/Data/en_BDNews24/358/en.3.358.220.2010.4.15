 Dhaka, Apr 15 (bdnews24.com)  BNP advisory council member Mir Nasir was barred from leaving for Saudi Arabia on Thursday. He was scheduled to board a Saudi Airlines flight at 4pm at Shahjalal International Airport. He had gone through passport control, but he was not allowed to leave the departure lounge. Nasir told bdnews24.com: "I was kept waiting from1:30pm to 3:45pm in the departure lounge." I was then told by an immigration officer, that "you can't be allowed to go abroad according to a high-up instruction." Nasir said the officers did not listen to him when he told them that he was going to perform Umrah-Hajj and to visit the graves of his wife, daughter and sister. His three family members died in a road accident in Saudi Arabia on Mar 5, 2006 and were burred there. Nasir was injured too. "They couldn't give a clear explanation as to why they were barring me from going abroad," he claimed. The former state minister for civil aviation said that he had already gone to Saudi Arabia twice for medical treatment during the tenure of this government. bdnew
