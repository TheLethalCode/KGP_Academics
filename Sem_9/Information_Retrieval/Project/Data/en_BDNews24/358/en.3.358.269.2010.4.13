 Dhaka, April 13 (bdnews24.com)--Finance minister AMA Muhith admitted on Tuesday that the government had failed to improve the power situation over the past year despite all efforts, with primary sources of energy remaining the key concern. Other senior members of the government, at an energy conference, said the economy was suffering. Muhith said that the power crisis faced by Bangladesh was "complex and comprehensive" as there were problems in all aspects of the sector including generation, transmission, distribution and pricing. "But the prime concern is the crisis of primary sources of energy," Muhith told the inaugural session of a conference titled 'Energy for Growth'. He also hinted that the government might not be able to achieve the target of power generation. "We are trying our best, but I have to admit that we did not do well in the past one year." The Awami League government, in its election manifesto, pledged to increase power generation to 5000 MW by 2011. It has increased installed capacity of power plants by over 500MW since coming to power in January 2009. The total production capacity of country's 40-plus power plants now stands at just over 6000MW  however lack of gas supply seriously cuts into production. According to figures from the Power Development Board, maximum power generation is around 4000 MW at present, having risen by about 200MW following the recent decision to divert gas supplies from fertiliser plants to power plants. The peak demand is 5500 MW. Speakers at the conference, organised by the International Chamber of Commerce Bangladesh (ICCB), pointed to the example of the Philippines, which overcame its power shortage within two years during the '90s. Muhith, however, ruled out the Philippines approach. "In that model, power plant contracts were awarded through negotiation without any bidding process, which is impossible in Bangladesh." He said the government was taking measures to attract more investment in the power sector. "We hope that we will be able to conclude the modalities of PPP (Public Private Partnership) by this financial year." Muhith, echoing the prime minister's call earlier this month, urged people to be "patient as it will take time to solve the power crisis". ECONOMY SUFFERING Commerce minister Faurk Khan, at the same event, said industries and businesses across the country have been hit hard due to the power shortage. "Export targets are not being achieved due to this crisis." According to Tawfik-e-Elahi, energy adviser to the prime minister, GDP growth could be 1-2 percent higher if it wasn't for the power and energy crises. "We [the government] inherited a legacy where development was frozen in the power and energy sectors," he said, pointing the finger at pervious administrations for the current scenario. Elahi stressed the urgent need for diversifying energy sources, including coal, nuclear and renewable energies. Terming coal extraction "a major challenge" for Bangladesh the adviser noted that the issue had divided people as it had far-reaching environmental consequences. "The government will finalise the legal framework for extraction of coal very soon." Meanwhile, Danish companies are interested in Bangladesh to implement carbon emission programs as well as in the energy sector, the Danish minister for development and cooperation S ren Pind told the audience. The visiting Danish minister is scheduled to meet the prime minister on Tuesday. "I am happy to know that Bangladesh is considering an energy mix, shifting away from dependence on gas for power," he said. The day-long opening session of the conference also heard form ICCB president Mahbubur Rahman and ICC global president Victor Fung. bd
