 Dhaka, Apr 11 (bdnews24.com)Pro-BNP lawyers on Sunday created an uproar in the High Court over rejection of a petition relating to BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's cantonment residence. The commotion took place in the HC bench of justices Iman Ali and Obaydul Hasan. The defendants had petitioned the court to defer hearings regarding a government order to the BNP chief to vacate the cantonment residence. Terming the judges as 'government supporters', the lawyers alleged that they would not get justice from the bench. The court asked them to calm down but the junior lawyers kept shouting.

HC bench deferred the hearing until Tuesday and asked the defendants to submit a petition. bdn
