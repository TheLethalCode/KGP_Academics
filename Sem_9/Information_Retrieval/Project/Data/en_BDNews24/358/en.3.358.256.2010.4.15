 Dhaka, Apr 15 (bdnews24.com)  Subscribers of state-owned BTCL will experience slower internet connection for the next few days. Officials of the Bangladesh Telecommunication Company Limited said Thursday that their subscribers will have less bandwidth due to a technical problem. A high official of the BTCL's submarine cable project, on condition of anonymity, told bdnews24.com that a short circuit at the Italian landing station at Palermo has disconnected Bangladesh partially. He said that BTCL was receiving only a portion of its regular bandwidth from Singapore leading to slow internet connection and in some cases no connection at all, for BTCL subscribers. The official, also a top-ranking administrator of Bangladesh Submarine Cable Company, said he hoped that Bangladesh would get reconnected with Italy within a few days.
