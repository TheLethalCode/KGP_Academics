The Icelandic Civil Defence Authority ordered 700 people to evacuate their homes and warned that melting ice could set off floods at a nearby river, which had already risen by 84 centimetres (33 inches), the radio said. A coast guard plane flying overhead was able to spot an opening in the glacier, but no lava or fire was immediately visible due to low clouds, the report said. Icelandic scientists had measured increased seismic activity near the glacier about two hours before the volcano started to erupt in the early morning on Wednesday, it added. In March, another volcano erupted near the Eyjafjallajokull glacier and caused no casualties. The volcano, situated beneath Iceland's fifth largest glacier, has erupted five times since Iceland was settled in the ninth century. Iceland sits on a volcanic hotspot in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and has relatively frequent eruptions, although most occur in sparsely populated areas and pose little danger to people or property. Before March, the last eruption took place in 2
