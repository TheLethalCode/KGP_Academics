 CHINGFORD, England, Apr 13(Reuters) - A scandal over expenses claimed by British legislators has tainted the perception of all politicians among many voters, undermining the opposition Conservatives' message they offer genuine change. That, says former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, is why his party is not further ahead of ruling Labour in the opinion polls before a May 6 election. Their lead has shrunk from double to single digits, leaving them unsure of an outright win. "Politics is in the gutter right now in a big, big way," Duncan Smith told Reuters in an interview, referring to revelations last year of wrongful expense claims filed by dozens of Members of Parliament (MPs) from both major parties. "Breaking through to the voters, getting them to feel uplifted about the idea of change, is now more difficult on the back of this whole mess," he said. Once seen as a hardline Conservative, Duncan Smith was ousted as leader in 2003 after two tumultuous years during which he failed to quell chronic party infighting or to provide a credible alternative to Tony Blair, then Labour prime minister. Since then, Duncan Smith has successfully reinvented himself as a champion of social justice, generating policy ideas on how to tackle problems such as teenage pregnancies to family breakdown and drug abuse. His Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) think tank has been influential on David Cameron, who became Conservative leader in 2005 and will be the next prime minister if the party wins the coming election, ending 13 years of Labour rule. SELFISH NO MORE Duncan Smith said the compassionate agenda pushed by the CSJ and embraced by Cameron was vital in overcoming the cynicism fuelled by the expenses scandal and convincing the voters that the party offered something genuinely new. Since the "markets-know-best" days of Margaret Thatcher, prime minister in the 1980s, the party had suffered from a perception among many voters that under its rule, the rich got richer while the poor got poorer and public services were neglected. "People are uneasy about the idea that what they get is as a result of somebody else being worse off," said Duncan Smith, speaking in his constituency in Chingford, a suburb of east London. "What the Conservative Party faced, for a period, was that people thought that under us, their self-interest was a selfish interest, that is to say that if you offered them lower taxes then you'd be punishing someone else to do it," he said. All of that had changed under Cameron, he said, adding that not only was it morally right for Conservatives to look for ways to solve grave social problems, but it also made economic sense as it would reduce welfare bills in the long-run. "There are sections of society that are now detached from the rest of it. That, to a Conservative, should be an anathema, not because you feel 'soft' about it but because you can't have a functioning economy with a whole chunk of people, growing numbers, playing no part in it," he s
