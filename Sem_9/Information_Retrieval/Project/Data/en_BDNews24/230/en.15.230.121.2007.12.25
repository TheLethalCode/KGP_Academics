<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com)Senior Awami League leader Motia Chowdhury Tuesday said she saw no possibility of launching a concerted movement against the present government. She said there was no pressure on the party leaders from activists to make such an effort. "I have no idea what other parties think of the matter. But there's no pressure on us for any movement along with other parties. In fact, we think the BNP-Jamaat coalition government is responsible for the current situation of the country," she told bdnews24.com. Asked what she thinks of a recent hint by acting party president Zillur Rahman that a movement could be launched if the legal course fails to free Sheikh Hasina, Motia said: "It's not proper to comment on any hearsay. However, the party central working committee will make the final decision on the issue." Motia, a former agriculture minister, accused the Election Commission of slow-paced preparations for the next polls. "Nobody will say the commission is running with time. We wanted a quick election. Still, we are waiting with patience. We want momentum to election activities," she said. On the missing of artefacts, meant for display at the Guimet Museum in France, Motia said: "The government should have been more cautious. The cultural affairs adviser has hinted at resigning. That's a good gesture but it won't solve the crisis." bdnews
