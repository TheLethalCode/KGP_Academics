 San Francisco, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A tiger killed a man at San Francisco Zoo and badly injured two teenage brothers on Tuesday, a year after an employee was mauled by a tiger at the park, according to local news reports. Radio station KCBS said the tiger attacked the unidentified 23-year-old man at the throat while he was in a cafe with his two friends, aged 19 and 18. The brothers, also unidentified, were taken to San Francisco General Hospital, with cuts and slashes all over their bodies, KCBS said. They were in "stable but critical condition," said Lt. Ken Smith, a spokesman with the San Francisco Fire Dept. The incident happened about 15 minutes after the 5 p.m. (0100 GMT Wednesday) closing time. It was not clear why the men were still at the zoo, or how the tiger escaped. Zoo officials declined comment. "We can only guess what occurred here," Smith said. Authorities initially believed that three other tigers had also also escaped, but the animals have been accounted for. The incident follows a Dec. 22, 2006, attack when a Siberian tiger ripped the flesh off a zookeeper's arm as horrified visitors looked on. The public feeding house was immediately closed, and reopened in September after $250,000 was spent on safety upgrades
