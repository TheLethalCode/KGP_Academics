<TITLE> Beer losing its fizzle in Germany </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BERLIN, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germans are losing their taste for beer, according to the German brewery association. Per-capita consumption of beer in Germany, once the world's largest consumer of the drink, fell by 3.5 litres in 2007 to 112.5 litres -- the eighth decline in the last nine years. Brewery Association managing director Peter Hahn told Die Welt newspaper on Monday demographics were partly to blame for the fall from a peak of 156 litres in the 1980s. But Germans are also drinking more non-alcoholic beverages, industry figures show. Only once in the last nine years did beer consumption in Germany rise -- in 2006 when it hosted the World Cup. It has long since fallen behind the Czech Republic and Ireland."
