 LONDON, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Soccer news in brief from round the world on Monday: Chelsea have goalkeeping concerns going into the busy Christmas schedule with first choice Petr Cech and Carlo Cudicini out injured. Cech was forced off in the 1-0 victory over Blackburn Rovers on Sunday and is still troubled by the hip injury sustained in a collision with Roque Santa Cruz. "Scans today have shown bruising around Petr's hip and side," Chelsea, who face Aston Villa on Wednesday, said in a statement. "Carlo Cudicini also continues to make progress from his rib injury and, again, we hope to have him available as soon as possible." Third-choice Portuguese keeper Henrique Hilario, who made his first appearance this season as substitute on Sunday, is next in line to take his place between the posts. Heracles Almelo have sacked coach Ruud Brood following a series of disappointing results, the Dutch league club said. Brood joined Heracles in July 2006 and kept them in the top flight in his first season in charge, though they are now 17th in an 18-team league with 10 points after 16 matches. The club said that assistant Hendrie Kruzen would take over temporarily. Goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel is returning to Manchester City in January after a loan spell at Cardiff City, manager Sven-Goran Eriksson said. The son of former Manchester United keeper Peter, Schmeichel began the season in goal for City but has slipped behing Joe Hart and Andrea Isaksson in the pecking order. "Kasper is coming back from January 2. I think his last game is the day before. He's here today training, as always, he comes here training twice a week with us," Eriksson said
