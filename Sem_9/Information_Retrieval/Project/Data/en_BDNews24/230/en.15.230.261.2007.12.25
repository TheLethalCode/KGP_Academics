 HARARE, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwean banks on Tuesday failed to heed pleas to remain open from shoppers desperate for cash, dampening already bleak Christmas festivities in the economically devastated nation. Banks, which had been ordered to extend their hours in the weeks leading up to Christmas as a result of a run on banknotes, were closed on Christmas Day contrary to earlier announcements.

The black market has flourished in step with the deepening economic crisis, which many critics blame on mismanagement by President Robert Mugabe's government. Mugabe, 83 and in power since independence from Britain in 1980, blames the economic problems on sabotage by Western powers who he says are opposed to his drive to seize and redistribute thousands of white-owned far
