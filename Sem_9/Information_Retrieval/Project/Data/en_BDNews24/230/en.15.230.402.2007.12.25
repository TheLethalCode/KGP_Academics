 BOSTON, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil prices rose above $94 on Monday in thin trading as dealers anticipated a further tightening of US energy stockpiles and foul weather forced Mexico to shut two key oil ports. The gains, however, were tempered by forecasts that mild weather in the Northeast would slash demand for fuel in the world's largest heating oil market. US crude CLc1> settled up 82 cents to $94.13 a barrel after trading between $92.50 and $94.23. Brent crude LCOc1> rose 24 cents to $92.70.

Energy forecasters including the International Energy Agency and producer group OPEC have cut projections for world oil demand growth in 2008, citing the threat of an economic slowdown. Oil dealers said Monday that Turkish incursions into northern Iraq to attack Kurdish rebels were also supportive of crude prices, dimming the prospects of a sustained recovery in oil exports from the region. Oil is up more than 50 percent in nominal terms since January and the average price for the first delivery month on the New York Mercantile Exchange is now around $72, up from $66.25 in 2006.
