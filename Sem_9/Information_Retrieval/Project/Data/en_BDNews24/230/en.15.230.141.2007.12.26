 Singapore, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks eased slightly on Wednesday although the dip was cushioned by strength in banks such as Kookmin after Merrill Lynch confirmed it got a cash injection from Singapore, while the yen hovered at a seven week low against the dollar. Trading activity was very quiet as investors stayed away for the Christmas holidays. Australia's and Hong Kong's markets were shut and many markets in Europe will remain closed. Shares in South Korea's Kookmin Bank, Singapore's DBS Group Holdings and Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ all rose, drawing support from news that US investment bank Merrill Lynch, hit by huge subprime mortgage losses, confirmed a report that it would increase its capital with an investment from Singapore's Temasek Holdings. Merrill Lynch is the latest in a growing number of Wall Street firms to receive cash from sovereign wealth funds as the sector shores up balance sheets as the credit crisis plays out. Japan's benchmark Nikkei average ended the morning session up 0.2 percent, with exporters including car maker Nissan Motor and camera maker Canon rising as the yen weakened and as US spending figures eased concerns that the major export market was tipping into a recession. "Fairly strong US Christmas sales are helping high-tech exporters, while the soft yen pushes up auto makers," said Katsuhiko Kodama, senior strategist at Toyo Securities. US retailers' holiday shopping season sales up to Dec. 24 rose 3.6 percent from a year earlier, helped by a late-season spending surge on some items, according to data released on Tuesday by SpendingPulse. The dollar stood at 114.01 yen as of 0215 GMT, staying near Monday's peak of 114.49 yen on electronic trading platform EBS, the highest since Nov. 7. The euro traded at around $1.4411. MSCI's measure of other Asia Pacific stocks was down 0.3 percent, drifting after having risen around 4 percent in the past 7 days. The index is about 11 percent below its Nov. 1 record high, but is still more than 30 percent as the year draws to a close. The gain is more than three times that for the MSCI All-Country World Index so far this year. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) fell 0.2 percent, giving up part ofits 4 percent jump in the past two sessions, although financials cushioned the drop. "Concerns about the US economy have been easing and investors are increasingly betting that global markets have pretty much reflected such risks," said Kang Moon-seok, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities. Taiwan's main TAIEX shares index fell 1 percent. Singapore's Straits Times index was up 0.4 percent and the Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.5 percent. Japanese government bond futures rose as investors hunted for bargains after a three-day slide, while minutes from the Bank of Japan's November meeting showed policy board members noted rising downside risks in the US economy. March 10-year JGB futures rose 0.21 point to 136.26 the benchmark 10-year yield fell 1.5 basis points to 1.565 percent. Oil traded above $94 a barrel, although Mexican export terminals reopened following a cold front that had helped fuel pre-holiday gains. US light, sweet crude for February delivery was 34 cents higher at $94.47 a barrel
