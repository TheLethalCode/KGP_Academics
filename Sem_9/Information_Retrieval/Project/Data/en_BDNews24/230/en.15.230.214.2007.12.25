 Dhaka, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com)  The emergency government is preparing to build an impressive CV of its successes as it completes a year of assumption of power. The chief of the government's press wing said they had asked the ministries to forward information for compilation at the year-end. "No specific decision has yet been taken about publishing any comprehensive account of achievements by the caretaker government, though," Iftekhar Hossain, principal information officer for the Press Information Department, told bdnews24.com by telephone. "We gathered similar progress reports and relevant information from all ministries at the end of the first six months too." A circular sent to the ministries and departments mentioned that a special supplement to be published highlighting the government's successes has been envisaged. The supplement will contain success stories in economy, policy planning, project implementation, production, services, administration, research and anti-corruption drive and the future plan. The PID passed on the directive to all the relevant government offices soon after it had received a similar notification from the top tier of the government. The political governments too carried out similar exercises at the end of the year to 'highlight their successes' in the past, said a top brass in the caretaker government, wishing to remain unnamed. bdnews24.com
