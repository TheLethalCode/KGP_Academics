 MUMBAI, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's Sania Mirza is hoping for an injury-free new year after her 2007 season was cut short due to a series of niggles. Mirza, 21, achieved a career-high singles ranking of 27 in August, following an impressive run in the U.S. hardcourt circuit when she reached the Stanford Classic final. But she lost time to injury and a surgery. "My first goal is to remain injury-free for the year. I lost three-four months (to injuries) last year," Mirza told reporters at a promotional event on Monday. World number 31 Mirza suffered a wrist injury after the U.S. Open, where she reached the third round, and then cut back the season by a couple of weeks following a strained abductor muscle in October. The Indian number one underwent surgery in March following a ligament injury in her right knee at the Qatar Open. Mirza, who will be back in action next month in Hobart, is hoping for a good outing at the Australian Open. "Being the first grand slam, there is where you have the most surprises because I feel because everyone's coming out of their off-season," said Mirza, who beat five top-20 players including former number one Martina Hingis last year. "A lot of seeds go out in the first couple of rounds," said Mirza who has reached the fourth round of a grand slam tournament once, the 2005 U.S. Open. "I am looking forward to it."
