<TITLE> Diabetics more likely to die after heart attack </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 New York, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - While the treatment of people with diabetes who suffer a heart attack has improved, along with subsequent survival rates, mortality is still higher than in non-diabetics, a study shows. Dr. Anna Norhammar, of the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden, and colleagues assessed death rates and treatment patterns in 1995-1998 and 1999-2002 in 70,882 people younger than age 80 years -- 14,873 of whom had diabetes. They report, in the medical journal Heart, that patients with diabetes have higher short- and long-term mortality rates after heart attack than those without diabetes. "This pattern has remained even after the introduction of modern therapeutic principles," they write. Specifically, the data show a decrease in the 1-year mortality rate from 1995 to 2002 from 16.6 percent to 12.1 percent in non-diabetic patients. In diabetic patients, 1-year mortality rates decreased from 29.7 percent to 19.7 percent. Nonetheless, diabetic heart attack patients were more likely to die than non-diabetic attack patients. Diabetics had an adjusted relative 1-year mortality risk of 1.44 in 1995-1998 and 1.31 in 1999-2002. Despite improvements in pre-admission and in-hospital treatment, patients with diabetes were less likely to receive immediate clot-busting therapy and revascularization procedures. Diabetic patients also less often received aspirin and lipid-lowering treatment at discharge. There are "ample opportunities for further improvements in the care of diabetic patients" who suffer heart attack, Norhammar's team concludes. While underlying co-illnesses in part account for the excess mortality in patients with diabetes, it can also be attributed to "a less than optimal use of established treatment modalities, especially lipid-lowering therapy and early revascularization."
