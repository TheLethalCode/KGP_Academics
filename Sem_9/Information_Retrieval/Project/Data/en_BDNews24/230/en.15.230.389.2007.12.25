<TITLE> Japan PM to meet hepatitis patients over scandal </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Tokyo, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda is set to meet hepatitis patients at the centre of a high-profile scandal over tainted blood on Tuesday as he tries to quell a row that risks further eroding his support ratings. The planned meeting, confirmed by a lawyer for the patients, comes on the heels of Fukuda's surprise announcement on Sunday that his ruling coalition would draft legislation to compensate all patients under equal conditions. Fukuda, who already faces voter anger over mishandled pension records and a bribery case involving a former top defence official, was dealt another blow last week when patients who had sued the government and drug makers rejected a government proposal for compensation. The patients turned down the government plan that would aid 1,000 patients, because it aimed to pay sufferers according to when they had been administered tainted products. The patients have also demanded that the government make clear its responsibility in the scandal. At least 10,000 people are estimated to have contracted hepatitis C from tainted products. Most cases have been linked to fibrinogen, a coagulant used to stop haemorrhaging during surgery or childbirth and sold in Japan even after it was withdrawn in the United States in 1977. In October, the government was embarrassed when Health Ministry officials admitted to having data that would have helped identify or warn hundreds of hepatitis patients before their illnesses worsened. Hepatitis C can lead to chronic liver infection and cirrhosis. About 1 percent to 5 percent of people with the disease eventually die from long-term infection, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The patients had repeatedly asked for a meeting with Fukuda in recent weeks but were turned down, even as media criticised the prime minister as being cold-hearted. Fukuda's meeting with the patients would come a week after public opinion polls found support ratings for Fukuda's cabinet had plunged to just over 30 percent, a level analysts say is crucial to stay in power
