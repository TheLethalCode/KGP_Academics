 Dhaka, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com)  Christians in Bangladesh Tuesday celebrated Christmas, the birth of Jesus Christ, amid festivity and with calls for peace and religious harmony. The Christians joined with those across the globe in celebrating the day with different festivities while many Muslim scholars echoed the call of the Pope Benedict XVI for peace in the increasingly violent world. In Dhaka's St Mary's Cathedral, the devotees sang: O come all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem Come and behold Him, born the King of Angels The festivities in the country came four days after the Muslims on Dec 21 celebrated their second largest religious festival, the Eid-ul Azha. Churches throughout the country were decorated with Christmas lights, flowers and replicas of mangers as a reminder of the humble birth of Christ. Children along with their parents and relatives flocked to the churches to pray while many others distributed sweets in the neighbourhood in the capital city and elsewhere. President Iajuddin Ahmed and chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed greeted the Christians in separate statements while leaders of the Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party also sent them their best wishes. According to Christian faith, Jesus was born to the Virgin Mary over 2000 years ago on this day. Muslims also believe Mary or Mariam is the mother of the prophet Jesus or Issa. The Christmas festivities began on Christmas Eve Monday. Special prayers were held in churches on the eve, and on Christmas Day morning. Special Christmas Eve prayers began at St Mary's Cathedral in Kakrail at about 8.45pm. Devotees had earlier brought out a colourful procession. Verses from the Holy Bible were recited. At the prayers, Theotonius Gomes, Auxiliary Bishop of Dhaka, said: "Christmas Day is the day to be great, to be a man of good mind. Jesus wants us to love each other and establish peace and unity through love. Let us love mankind truly." Gomes had earlier spoken to bdnews24.com at the Archbishop's House in Kakrail on different aspects of the celebrations. The preparations for observing Christmas begin four weeks before the even and the festivities end with the New Year, he said. On the eve of Christmas, Christians across the world eagerly await the message of the Pope, Bishop Gomes said. "This time the Pope has given a message of hope for people. The world is going through many troubles. God is among people and He will create hope for them." The bishop said prayers would be held for the people especially those facing disasters. Prayers will seek peace for all. The bishop greeted people on the eve of the Christmas and said he would pray for peace for Bangladeshis. Mass prayers began in the churches throughout the country Tuesday morning, with singing of Christmas carols. The main congregation was held at Ramna Cathedral, with Bishop Gomes leading the prayers. However, the largest Christmas Mass took place at Tejgaon church. Father Kamal Koraia of the Christian Relations Centre said up to 5,000 people take part in the prayers there. Various other celebratory events have been held in churches, community centres and hotels from Christmas morning. Some arranged special Christmas programmes for children. Dhaka Sheraton Hotel arranged a Christmas Party for children Tuesday morning. Christmas carols were sung, after which it was announced that Santa Claus would appear. Good old Santa entered the hotel ballroom ringing his sleighbells and bearing Christmas gifts to distribute among the children at the party The hotel also arranged fun games, including chocolate writing, a treasure hunt and musical chairs. The Ball Room was decorated with balloons and colourful flowers on the occasion, and the annual Christmas tree was in place in the hotel atrium. Reuters from Vatican City reports: Pope Benedict on Tuesday said he hoped Christmas would bring consolation to those living in poverty, injustice and war and appealed for just solutions to conflicts in Iraq, the Holy Land, Afghanistan and Africa. In his Urbi et Orbi (to the city and the world) Christmas Day message, the Pope also urged people in modern societies to accept the light of Christ and warned that many human tragedies were caused by environmental upheavals. "May this Christmas truly be for all people a day of joy, hope and peace," he said in his address from the central balcony of St Peter's Basilica to tens of thousands of people below. Reuters from Paris reports: Leading Muslim scholars have addressed warm Christmas greetings to Christians around the world, a message notable both for what it said and the fact that it was sent at all. The greetings, sent by a group of 138 Sunni, Shia, Sufi and other scholars who recently proposed a dialogue with Christian leaders, called for peace on earth and thanked church leaders who have responded positively to their invitation. "Al-Salaamu Aleikum, Peace be upon you, Pax Vobiscum," the greetings letter began in Arabic, English and Latin. "May the coming year be one in which the sanctity and dignity of human life is upheld by all," it added. "May it be a year of humble repentance before God and mutual forgiveness within and between communities." bdnews24.com/mr
