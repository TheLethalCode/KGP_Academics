<TITLE> Fearless Tigers set to take on wary Kiwis </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com)  Fearless Bangladesh will eye a confident start against hosts New Zealand who are running low on confidence when they face off in the first of the three one-day matches at Eden Park in Auckland Wednesday. The match starts at 5:00am Bangladesh standard time and Indian satellite channel SAB will telecast the match live from the venue. Captain Mohammad Ashraful and Co had enough timetwo weeks to be preciseto get accustomed to New Zealand's condition and played two one-day warm-up matches and a Twenty20 match before the series gets underway amid an overcast weather. "In every practice game we showed improvement. The bowlers have found the right length more consistently and the batsmen have showed that they are in good touch," said Ashraful after a nets session on the Christmas morning. "It is just that we have to be careful in not losing wickets in the middle order when someone is set. The players are all fit and we are really looking forward to the series." "We have played on drop-in pitches in Cairns and Darwin during the tour of Australia and the bounce was a bit inconsistent. I hope tomorrow's one is a good wicket because you can never tell for sure as these pitches cannot develop a character like normal wickets which are in place for years," Ashraful was quoted as saying by tigercricket.com, the official website of the Bangladesh Cricket Board. After missing the twenty20 match, pace spearhead Mashrafee Bin Mortaza and left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak have returned to the playing fold. The team management has kept opener Javed Omar, pacers Nazmul Hossain, Sajidul Islam and injured Tushar Imran out of the squad, meaning Junaed Siddique is going to make his ODI debut. "I was expecting this as I have come here determined to win a place in the Bangladesh side and I have worked hard. It is my debut match but I don't have any butterflies in my stomach. I just want to go out there and give it my best shot. I am a positive and confident person and I want to do well," said Junaed. "The wickets here are good for batting if you are prepared to leave the balls. If you see it till the end then batting can be enjoyable as there is consistent bounce," Junaed added. Coach Jamie Siddons wanted the team to continue doing more right things than wrong. "We should not expect us to go and win the series. We have to play the best we can and if results come our way than that'd be fantastic. We are playing against a much better ranked side and the goal for us is to be competitive. "People who have seen us play in New Zealand are saying how good we look in the field and we need do keep doing that. I don't expect overnight improvements." It rained in Auckland Tuesday and might rain the next day, which means the series opener is under threat. After their defeats in both one-day warm-up matches, Bangladesh no doubt will want to put up some good show against the Kiwis after drubbing the New Zealand XI, comprising former Black Caps captain Stephen Fleming, Jamie How, Peter Fulton, Ross Taylor, Scott Styris and Jeetan Patel, in the Twenty20 match. In the two warm-up matches, the Tigers learnt that 220 to 240 runs on the board is not enough to defend, and the top order must play the key role in racking up a challenging total against the New Zealand, who suffered successive defeats to Australia and South Africa recently. The Tigers' positive approach can tame any rival on their day, although Bangladesh have not won against the Tasman rivals in ODIs bar a warm-up match in the World Cup nine months ago. Fleming also warned the home side of Bangladesh. "If we're tentative, they'll put up a fight," he said Monday. Fleming also spoke of Bangladesh's fearless approach to battinga sharp contrast to the Blacks Caps' current mindsetas a potential danger. The Black Caps are desperate to turn their season around and want to maintain its third place in the ICC ODI rankings with a clean series sweep. Bangladesh lost all eight one-day internationals they have played against New Zealand. Bangladesh squad: Tamim Iqbal, Junaed Siddique, Aftab Ahmed, Mohammad Ashraful, Saqib Al Hasan, Mehrab Hossain Junior, Mushfiqur Rahim, Farhad Reza, Abdur Razzak, Mashrafee Bin Mortaza and Shahadat Hossain. New Zealand (From): Daniel Vettori (Captain), Brendon McCullum (Wicketkeeper), Jamie How, Peter Fulton, Scott Styris , Ross Taylor, Mathew Sinclair, Jacob Oram, Kyle Mills, Mark Gillespie, Chris Martin, Jeetan Patel b
