In this guise, the warhead cannot be targeted by anti-missile systems that rely on a ballistic trajectory for their calculations. Tuesday's launch is the second such test-firing of the Sineva in less than a week. Speaking after the last successful launch, a general said Russia could thwart any anti-missile system in the foreseeable future. "The military hardware now on our weapons, and those that will appear in the next few years, will enable our missiles to outperform any anti-missile system, including future systems," General Nikolai Solovtsov told journalists on Dec. 17. The United States plans to deploy a missile defence system in Central Europe. It says it is intended to defend against attacks by "rogue states", not Russia. Moscow says the system poses a security threat and has promised counter-measures. The test missile was fired from the Tula, one of seven Russian Dolphin-class submarines which is capable of carrying 16 intercontinental rockets and torpedoes, according to data published on the Russian Defence Ministry web si
