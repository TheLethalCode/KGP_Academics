 KABUL, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghanistan has detained two foreign nationals, who local news portals described as `European', for posing a threat to national security, a presidential palace official said on Tuesday. The official refused to be drawn on whether the arrests were in connection with a recent government crackdown on private foreign-run security organisations.

Idema was granted an amnesty by President Hamid Karzai earlier this year, but initially refused to leave his cell until compensated by the Afghan and US governments. He left a few weeks later and is now believed to be in Dub
