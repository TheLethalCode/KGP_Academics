 Dhaka, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Tuesday remanded 15 people for five days in a case that involves their alleged roles in the theft of two rare artefacts from Zia International Airport. Of the arrestees, three were officials of Air France's Dhaka office and seven were cargo loaders. Airport police sub-inspector Monu Shoheb Imtiaz, investigating officer of the case, sought 10 days to quiz the arrestees, but the court approved only five days. The first information report did not mention the names of the accused. The 15 people were arrested on suspicion of their involvement in the incident and sent to court. Defence lawyers Karimul Haider Chowdhury, Kajem Ali Dulal and Abdul Hye opposed the appeal for remand. The counter-appeal by the defence lawyers was rejected. Two statues of Vishnu, which were up for shipment to Paris for display at the Guimet Museum, went missing from Zia International Airport. The incident came to light Saturday. The arrestees are Zamiul Abedin, Masud Rana Saiful, Edward Roy, Dev Barua, Amir Hamza, Abdul Hakim Babul, Solaiman, Abu Bakar, Afsar, Abul Hossain, Md Al Momin, Shahjahan Ali, Shariful Islam Manik, Bilal Hossain and Shanker Chandra Dey. bdnews24
