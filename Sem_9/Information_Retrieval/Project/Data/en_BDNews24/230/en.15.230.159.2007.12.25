 Dhaka, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com)  The authorities Tuesday brought rare artefacts back to Bangladesh National Museum from Zia International Airport, hours after the interim government cancelled a second shipment to Paris over the theft of two Vishnu statues. An emergency meeting, chaired by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed in his office, decided not to send the remaining artefacts to Paris for display at the Guimet Museum. The government described the theft of the statues of the Hindu god as an unfortunate incident. In a statement, the Press Information Department said the remaining artefacts would not be dispatched until the "matter related to the theft case is resolved". The statement pointed to the "complexity" and the "public sentiment that arose due to this incident". The government had accepted an offer from the Guimet Museum to showcase its rich cultural heritage in Paris in keeping with the "usual practice of countries doing such displays". Ruhul Amin, officer in-charge of the Airport Police Station, said they sent the remaining 12 cartons of the artefacts back to the museum after necessary examination by officials at ZIA. Another carton, which carried two statues of Vishnu, went missing. The matter came to light Saturday. The cartons were the part of the second consignment ready to go to Paris for the exhibition as part of a deal by the two governments. The first consignment went to Paris earlier this month, despite protests by art lovers and conservators who had feared the objects might go missing in transit or in France. Ruhul Amin said the artefacts were sent back to the museum after eight hours of examination by the officials of the cultural affairs ministry, the museum and the courier Homebound. Shahbagh police chief Mohammad Suruzzaman said at 7:30 pm that the van carrying the cartons from the airport arrived at the museum. GOVT FORMS HIGH-POWERED COMMITTEE The meeting at the CA's office Tuesday decided to form a high-powered committee with the cabinet secretary as its chief to make a comprehensive report on sending the artefacts to Paris and the theft of some at Zia International Airport on Dec 22, the PID said in the statement. The government on Dec 23 formed a five-member committee to investigate the incident. It was assigned to file a report in three workdays. The meeting reviewed the situation in the wake of the theft of two "archaeologically priceless" terracotta Vishnu statues. It decided that the Guimet Museum would be informed that it would not be possible to display the items at the exhibition as planned. PROTEST IN CHITTAGONG Some 150 cultural activists and teachers linked their hands in Chittagong to demand the government find the lost artefacts and arrest the responsible. Their protest came after police obstructed a rally planned by them at the Central Shaheed Minar in the port city. Police said their action came as the organisers of the rally did not take permission from them. The protesters accused the government of failure in protecting the artefacts. They alleged that the incident occurred because of the insistence by the French government, which "ignored the protest by cultural activists" against the shipment of the artefacts to France for display. Speaking to bdnews24.com, Prof Abul Mansur of the fine arts department of Chittagong University, said France cannot avoid the responsibility for the lost treasures. "So far we have understood the artefacts went missing after they were handed over to the French authorities," he said. He went on to demand expulsion of the French envoy to Bangladesh for his recent comments in his interviews with television channels. bdnews24.com/
