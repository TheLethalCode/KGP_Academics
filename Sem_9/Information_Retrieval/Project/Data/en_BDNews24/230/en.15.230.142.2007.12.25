<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com)Foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury said Tuesday that the country earned a respectable status in the world because of its troops' sacrifice in UN peace missions. He made the comment in the city as a cultural group, Rhythm Cultural Society, commemorated the Dec 25 air crash, which left 15 Bangladeshi soldiers dead in the African country of Benin four years ago. The peacekeepers were on their way home on leave when the accident occurred in 2003. "The supreme sacrifice of our soldiers in the UN peace missions has emboldened our determination in peacekeeping and gifted Bangladesh a respectable status in the world," the adviser said. Gano Forum president Kamal Hossain chaired the commemoration meeting. Currently, Bangladesh is the second largest contributor of soldiers to the mission. Some 10,000 Bangladeshi peacekeepers, mostly soldiers, are now deployed in troubled parts of the world. More than 62,000 Bangladeshis have served the peacekeeping mission to date, the meeting was told. Some 79 Bangladeshi peacekeepers died either in accident or in ambush since 1989. bdn
