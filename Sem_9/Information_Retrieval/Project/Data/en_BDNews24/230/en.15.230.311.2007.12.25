 TEHRAN, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Three students jailed for up to three years on charges including insulting Iran's Supreme Leader have been granted release on bail of about $85,000 each, their lawyer said on Tuesday. Lawyer Mohammad Ali Dadkhah said the university students, who were arrested in May, remained in detention but bail had been set at 800 million rials each, adding that he hoped that their convictions would soon be quashed by a higher court. "The appeals court ... ruled to release them on bail amounting to 800 million rials each," Dadkhah told Reuters, adding that two of them had already secured the money. "So I hope they will be released and then acquitted soon." He said students Ahmad Ghassaban, Majid Tavakkoli and Ehsan Mansouri were sentenced two months ago for acting against national security as well as insulting Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's highest authority. He did not give details. Tavakkoli was sentenced to three years in jail, Ghassaban to two and a half, and Mansouri to two years, he said. U.S.-based Human Rights Watch said earlier this year they were among eight students arrested on charges of "insulting state leaders", "inciting public opinion", and "printing inflammatory and derogatory materials" in student publications. The students said the publications were forged and that they had no role in producing them, the rights group said. In July, five of the students were released on bail. They were studying at Amir Kabir University, one of Tehran's largest, with a history of student activism. At the same university in December last year, dozens of students burned pictures of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and threw firecrackers in an apparent effort to disrupt his speech. It was the first time the hardline president, elected in 2005 pledging a return to the values of the 1979 Islamic revolution, had faced such open hostility at a public event. Rights activists and Western diplomats say pro-reform students have been among groups targeted in what they say is a new crackdown on dissenting voices. Others being pressured include labour movement figures and intellectuals, they say. The president and his government say they support free speech and welcome constructive opposition. Judiciary spokesman Alireza Jamshidi said the three Amir Kabir students had been convicted twice on different charges and had already served a four-month sentence. He confirmed at a news conference on Tuesday that the stiffer jail terms of up to three years had been appealed, but did not say whether they would be freed on bail. Earlier this month, protesters demanding the release of detained students tore down the bars of a gate at another Tehran university, an Iranian media report said and photographs show
