 Dhaka, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com)  Electoral campaign in Noakhali-1 constituency comes to a close on Saturday midnight as the election to the seat is slated for Jan. 12, an Election Commission official said. "From Saturday midnight until 48 hours after vote counting starts on Monday, rallies and processions are banned," EC deputy secretary Mihir Sarwar Morshed told bdnews24.com. "Voting will start at 8am and continue nonstop through to 4pm on Monday. There will be more security personnel than usual to ensure safety in the lone constituency left for the belated election," the EC official said. Some 247407 registered voters are expected cast their ballots. All motorised vehicles barring the authorised ones will be off the roads in the Sonaimuri-Chatkhil area from Saturday midnight through Monday midnight, Morshed said. He also said the ban will be applicable to auto-rickshaws, taxicabs, microbus, jeep, pickups, sedan cars, buses, trucks and three-wheeled 'tempos'. Motorcycles have been banned in the constituency from Saturday midnight until Jan 14 midnight. The vehicles exempted from the ban are those carrying authorised local and foreign polls observers, journalists, election officials, law enforcers, ambulances and emergency utilities including gas, power, posts and telecommunications. Restrictions may be relaxed with permission of the returning officer on the vehicles of candidates or their agents, port and emergency supplies. The Election Commission on Dec. 4 postponed the election in the constituency following death of former Ganatontri Party president Awami League-led grand alliance candidate Nurul Islam. It announced fresh schedule on Dec 23. Election to the rest 299 seats was held on Dec 29. bd
