 Dhaka, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com)  Different organisations staged protests against the continuing Israeli attack on Gaza, outside the capital's Baitul Mukarram National Mosque after Friday prayers. Over five hundred people from Khelafat Majlish, Bangladesh Khelafat Andolon and other groups gathered at the north gate of the mosque. They chanted slogans against Israel and the United Nations, some of them also censuring the lack of action by Muslim nations in stopping the Israeli aggression. The protestors set an effigy of Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert on fire, and tried to take out a procession from the mosque though they faced police barricades at the Dainik Bangla and Paltan crossings. A second procession marched forward up to Kakrail and returned back to Baitul Mukarram peacefully. No untoward situation took place, though the road between Dainik Bangla and Paltan crossing intersections remained closed so traffic jams built up in the area during the hour-long demonstration. Israel pressed its air and ground attack in the Gaza Strip on Friday, ignoring a UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire. Israeli foreign minister Tzipi Livni said: "Israel has acted, is acting and will act only according to its considerations, the security needs of its citizens and its right to self defence." The 14-day onslaught in Gaza took the death toll to over 750 on Friday, of which more than a third were children, say Palestinian sources. Rocket fire by Hamas on Israeli towns have killed 22 people since 2000. bdnews24.
