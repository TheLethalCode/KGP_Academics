 Dhaka, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com)  Sheikh Hasina began her first day in office as the prime minister on Wednesday, the day after she took the oath as the head of the government. Cabinet secretary Mohammad Abdul Aziz, PMO secretary Kazi Aminul Islam and other senior officials received the new prime minister offering flowers as she arrived there at around 10:25 am. Hasina left the office last on July 15, 2001, her last working day as the prime minister then. Earlier, the Awami League president went to Bangabandhu Smriti Jadughar at Dhanmondi road 32 at around 8:22 am, offered flowers at her father's portrait and spent some time there. From there, Hasina went straight to the national mausoleum in Savar to pay respects to the liberation war martyrs. A smartly turned out contingent of the three armed forces presented an armed salute to the memory of the liberation war heroes. She signed in the memorial register and planted a bokul sapling. A good number of ministers and top AL leaders accompanied the prime minister through the tribute paying sojourn. bdnews
