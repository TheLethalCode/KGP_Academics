 LONDON, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nigel Clough could be about to follow in his father Brian's footsteps by becoming manager of former English champions Derby County. "Of course I'd be interested (in the vacant job)," Clough told Setanta Sports television on Monday. "It's a great opportunity but it's just talk at the moment. Let's see what comes of it." Derby chairman Adam Pearson told Sky Sports News that Clough was among the candidates for the job at the Championship (second division) club. "Nigel has definitely been on our horizon but there are a number of other candidates," Pearson said. "The list is short now." The charismatic Brian Clough managed Derby from 1967-73 and led the club from the second division to a league title. He went on to enjoy even more success with Nottingham Forest, guiding them to European Cup glory in 1979 and 1980. Renowned for his outspoken manner as well as his great achievements in the game, he died in 2004. Son Nigel enjoyed a successful playing career taking in Forest and Liverpool among other clubs. For the past decade he has been player-manager of minor league side Burton Albion. Derby have been drawn against Forest in the fourth round of the FA Cup
