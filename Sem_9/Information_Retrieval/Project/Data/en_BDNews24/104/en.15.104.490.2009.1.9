 BEIJING, Fri Jan 9,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese officials have apologized to a Belgian journalist who was beaten while trying to report on AIDS in central Henan province and offered some compensation for damaged and stolen possessions, his television station said. Tom van de Weghe said he was forced from a car at night and hit over the head by people who stole tapes, cell phones and money in the November assault. Three television crew members with him were also attacked and equipment damaged. Five local officials have now sent a handwritten letter and 150 euros in compensation for the attack, which they initially denied had happened, his Belgian television station VRT said. "Unfortunate things happened that day. We feel guilty when we recall it," a VRT statement quoted the letter saying. "We want to apologize, forgive us," it added. A provincial official contacted by Reuters declined comment. The team had been interviewing AIDS-affected families in an area where blood-selling schemes and untested transfusions in the 1990s left whole villages stricken. Provincial authorities were initially quoted by Chinese media saying that AIDS victims upset at being interviewed were trying to get tapes back, and that a local official whom Van de Weghe had identified as leading the attack was merely trying to help them. But after an investigation most of the tapes were returned in December and the letter and compensation followed. It is rare, but not unprecedented, for officials to apologize to journalists roughed up in the course of their work. Foreign correspondents, who have more freedom to both report and publish than their Chinese counterparts, are legally allowed to cover stories across most of the country as long as they have the agreement of the person they are interviewing. But they can face harassment or physical threats when covering stories about sensitive issues like corruption or protest that authorities want to keep hushed up
