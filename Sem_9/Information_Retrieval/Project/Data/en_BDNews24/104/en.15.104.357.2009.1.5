<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 5 (bdnews24.com)Janakantha editor Atiqullah Khan Masud was granted interim bail for four months in four separate cases on Monday. Lawyer Nikhil Chandra told bdnews24.com: "The High Court granted him bail in four cases. If he can secure bail in the remaining two cases against him relating to income tax, he will be released from jail." A High Court bench comprising justice Md Mozammel Hossain and justice Afzal Hossain Ahmed gave the bail orders Monday in three cases of forgery and one on acquisition of illegal wealth. Barrister Amirul Islam represented Atiqullah; barrister Tania Amir, barrister Shamim Patwary and advocate Nikhil Chandra Datta assisted. Barrister Amirul Islam told the court," The government repealed the emergency powers ordinance and lifted the state of emergency. So the High Court can now grant bail in these types of cases. Besides, Atiqullah Khan is ill. He should be bailed on health grounds." Deputy attorney general Abdur Rab argued against bail pointing out that Atiqullah was sentenced by a special tribunal to 21 years imprisonment in the three forgery cases, each carrying sentence of seven years, and to 13 years in the illegal wealth case.
