 By Arshad Mahmud in Washington Washington, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com)With the official inauguration of president-elect Barack Obama just days away, Americans' interest about the incoming first family's every move is reaching fever pitch. While the media is reporting on the Obamas' every public appearance since they arrived in Washington on Jan 5, ordinary Americans are just as eager to know what's going on behind the scenes: how are they preparing their move into the White House after Obama is sworn in on Jan. 20. More precisely, how exactly will the president-elect and his family get all their belongings into their new home? Will they hire movers? Well, an enterprising reporter for slate.com, an online news outlet, has worked hard to get some answers with the help of White House staff, who seem to be well versed in the affair. Under US law, it turns out the president-elect is responsible for transportation of his furniture, clothes, and personal effects from Chicago to a White House storage facility located in the neighbouring state of Maryland (where they also keep antiques, Easter decorations, paintings, etc.). The whole process is overseen by the Secret Service. And it usually happens the week before the inauguration.

The Inauguration Day move-in takes about six hours starting at 10.30am, when the sitting president and the first lady have a traditional tea with the president-elect before heading over to Capitol Hill for the swearing-in. Once they leave, the 93-person White House staff shifts into high gear. They don't hire outside help for security reasons as well as privacy. The operations personnel does the heavy lifting while a housekeeping detail helps prepare the bedrooms, curators make sure the furnishings and dcor are just so, florists worry about bouquet arrangements, and the chefs prepare the post-inauguration dinner. At the same time, the staff moves the ex-president out. Items get loaded into boxes, which get loaded into vans and then military cargo planes that carry everything to the former president's new residence in Dallas. With only two elevators, it's organised chaos. And who pays for all this? Congress draws up an annual executive residence budget, which gets a little extra funding every four years to cover move-in costs, such as packing equipment and overtime for staff members. The first family also gets a redecoration fund to cover draperies, carpets,
