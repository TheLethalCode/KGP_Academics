<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com) Awami League spokesperson Syed Ashraful Islam has buffed rival BNP's claims that the party had promised before the elections to make rice available at Tk 10 a kg and give farmers fertiliser free of cost. Referring to BNP's propaganda against AL, he said, "BNP is spreading lies against Awami League. Nowhere in our manifesto has it been said that people will be given rice at Tk 10 and fertiliser for free." Speaking at a press conference at AL president Sheikh Hasina's political office at Dhanmandi in the city, Ashraful, the local government and cooperatives minister, asked BNP to stop telling lies. Salauddin Quader Chowdhury, parliamentary affairs secretary to Khaleda Zia, told bdnews24.com earlier on Tuesday, ""People expect they will get rice at Tk 10 per kg, fertiliser free of cost and employment for one member in every family from the new government." Chowdhury made the remarks after the new government headed by prime minister Sheikh Hasina was sworn in. Ashraful said the AL welcomed BNP's decision to join the first session of the new parliament. "If BNP comes to parliament, they will be given floor," said Syed Ashraful Islam on Thursday, terming the arch rival's decision positive. Earlier on Wednesday, a meeting chaired by BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia decided to take oath and join parliament when it convenes. "We want no more conflict and terrorism in politics. We hope they (BNP) will play an active role for change." "We must not stand terrorism and terrorists," he said. The media conference was arranged following Wednesday's cabinet decision to cut diesel price and increase subsidies in fertiliser. "The government's decision to beat price hike and ensure economic stability for facing the existing depression are meant to make a difference in line with the party's election manifesto." He said. bd
