 WASHINGTON, Sun Jan 11, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barack Obama will begin the search for Middle East peace immediately on becoming president and the Gaza conflict only underscored his determination to become involved early, he said in remarks broadcast on Sunday. During his presidential campaign, Obama said both President George W. Bush and former President Bill Clinton waited too long to work vigorously to broker a peace between the Israelis and Palestinians. On the ABC News show "This Week with George Stephanopoulos," Obama said it would be important to begin the effort early. "The reason it's so important for the United States to be engaged and involved immediately, not waiting until the end of their term, is because working through the politics of this requires a third party that everybody has confidence (in), wants to see a fair and just outcome," he said. Obama, who takes over from President George W. Bush on Jan. 20, has refused to make any lengthy comments on the violence in Gaza, where more than 800 Palestinians have been killed in the 16-day Israeli offensive to suppress rocket fire against its citizens by the militant group Hamas. Thirteen Israelis have been killed. Obama said the deaths of civilians on both the Palestinian and Israeli side were "heartbreaking." "And obviously what that does is it makes me much more determined to try to break a deadlock that has gone on for decades now," he said
