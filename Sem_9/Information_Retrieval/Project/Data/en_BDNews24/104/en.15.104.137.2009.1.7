<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com)  On his first day in office, education minister Nurul Islam Nahid has warned against corruption and said the perpetrators would be sought out. "Corruption and extravagance are two major problems we are faced with and we must be tough on corruption. There'll be no room for the evil practice and we'll not put up with those responsible behind it," Nahid said on Wednesday. Terming education the top priority for the nation, the new minister said, "We want modern education that suits time and caters to practical demands." "Teachers are the main guiding force, but unfortunately we failed to tap the potentials of the teachers," Nahid said at the Secretariat after assuming his office. "We will from now pick the brains from them and draw on other experts to move forward." To a questioner, the former communist leader said, "Many teachers lost jobs in the past as they fell victim to political grudge. Their cases will be considered." "The people's judgement has laid down the guidelines for us. We must upgrade the educational standards and also implement all the electoral pledges." He sought a shift from the longstanding tradition that the education policy changes with the change in government. Earlier, in an introductory meeting with the officers and employees of the ministry, Nahid expressed the hope that "all in the ministry would work as a team". Education secretary Momtajul Islam and additional secretary Mozammel Huq Khan also spoke. After the meeting, Nahid went to the primary and mass education ministry, also vested in him. He told his civil servants there that the new government would like to bank on the experience it had gathered during its tenure in 1996-2001. bdne
