 Dhaka, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia was set to go to Noakhali on Friday for election campaign for the deferred polls in Noakhali-1 constituency. Khaleda will first address a public rally at Sonaimuri High School ground in the afternoon and then at Chatkhil PG High School. This is her first public rally after the debacle of the four-party alliance in the Dec. 29 election. The Election Commission deferred the election to Noakhali-1 constituency after Awami League-grand alliance candidate, Ganatantri Party president Nurul Islam, died in his apartment in a fire. According to the new schedule, the voting to that constituency will be held on Jan. 12
