 GAZA, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israel has warned it may intensify its two-week-old offensive as it continued with its tank fire and air strikes in the Gaza Strip on Sunday. Its tanks cut deeper into the coastal enclave while Israel threatened to intensify air and ground assaults against militants who fired rockets into the Jewish state, as the conflict entered a 16th day. Reports of more Palestinian deaths came as Israel dropped leaflets warning Gazans to stay away from Hamas-controlled areas, saying its operation would escalate. Both sides vowed to fight on, ignoring international calls for a ceasefire. A total of 846 Palestinians and thirteen Israelis --- three civilians killed by rocket fire and 10 soldiers --- have been killed since Israel's offensive began on Dec. 27. Hamas's leader in exile, Khaled Meshaal, said his Islamist group would not consider a truce until Israel ended its military offensive and lifted a blockade of the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip. Palestinian witnesses reported heavy fighting east of the city of Gaza where Hamas militants fired anti-tank missiles and mortar bombs at advancing Israeli forces who responded with tank shells and air strikes. An Israeli air strike targeting a car on a coastal road killed two militants on Sunday, medical workers said. Israeli artillery shelling of two villages in the southern Gaza Strip killed a woman and set 15 houses on fire, medical workers and witnesses said. Some 50 people suffered from burns and gas inhalation, they said. Human Rights Watch has accused Israel of using white-phosphorus munitions and warned of undue suffering to Palestinian civilians through severe burns. The Israeli military said it uses only weapons permitted under international law. It has accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields. WAR OF WORDS While Israeli commanders said whole Hamas battalions were being wiped out, Meshaal said Israeli forces had achieved nothing and pointed to the continued rocket fire. Israeli actions have drawn denunciations from the Red Cross, U.N. agencies and Arab and European governments, spurred by the Palestinian civilian death toll in the hundreds. Israel has pressed on with its offensive despite a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire and Egyptian-European efforts at mediation, saying it is intent on stopping Hamas rocket fire. The group fired about a dozen rockets at Israel on Saturday, while a phalanx of Israeli tanks advanced from the north towards the city of Gaza. Israel is demanding a complete halt to Hamas rocket fire, plus regional and international guarantees to stop the group rearming via smuggling tunnels under the border with Egypt. Hamas wants any ceasefire deal to include the ending of Israel's crippling economic blockade of the Gaza Strip and the withdrawal of all Israeli forces from the territory, from which the Jewish state withdrew in 2005 after a 38-year occupation. bd
