 Comilla, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chief Khaleda Zia said on Friday BNP wanted the Awami League government to live up to its election promises as she campaigned in the Noakhali-1 constituency. "We want to see that those who have gone to power through rigging materialise their election pledges," Khaleda said. "They have promised a lot before the election, but now, after winning the election, they are now denying those promises," Khaleda said at a rally in Comilla. She once again alleged her party was forcibly defeated in the election. "The [caretaker] government and the Election Commission did not work neutrally in the election; they worked in favour of a particular party and alliance. This way BNP was made," she told supporters at Comilla Circuit House, as she paused on her way to Noakhali district. The former prime minister called on the supporters not to get frustrated with the defeat. "The people of the country are with me; we will reform our party from grassroots amid dissolving all party committees." "Together, we'll form government again in the future winning the next election," Khaleda said. Earlier in the morning, Khaleda left her Shahid Mainul Road residence for Noakhali to campaign for the postponed election to Noakhali-1 constituency, which was deferred following death of a candidate of the constituency. The election will be held on Jan. 12. In the afternoon, Khaleda restarted her journey to Noakhali from Comilla Circuit House. She reiterated the allegation that the Dec. 29 elections had been rigged. "The BNP has been defeated by unbelievable rigging. Not only the BNP has been made to lose through the rigging, but the people of the country were also cheated." She asked the Election Commission to act properly so that no vote rigging took place 'this time'. Khaleda alleged that the AL-led government has been "killing and repressing" BNP supporters. "Sitting in power, they have been killing and repressing our leaders and supporters; they are occupying our supporters' houses and other structures, and looting those." "They had begun killing people after assuming power in 1996 as well and this time they have killed our supporter Nazrul Islam," Khaleda said. She introduced the Noakhali-1 four-party candidate AM Mahbubuddin Khokon and sought vote for him. Khaleda called on the supporters to work together for the upcoming Upazila Parisad election scheduled for Jan. 22. She also addressed another rally in Chatkhil PG High School ground. Addressing the Chatkhil rally, Khaleda said "We'll go to the parliament and will speak for people." "We'll resist together with people if there is anything happening against the country's sovereignty." After the Chatkhil rally, Khaleda started for Dhaka at around 6:45pm. bdnews24
