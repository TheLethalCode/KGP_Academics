<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 5 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission, backed by the power to award jail terms, is taking a firm stance on the submission of poll expense returns by candidates in the just-concluded national election. The EC will notify the returning officers about the issue in a day or two, said election commissioner Sohul Hossain on Monday. According to the Representation of the People Order, amended last year, the EC can sentence candidates failing to submit poll expense returns to 2-7 years in jail, say polls officials. "The Commission will verify the returns submitted," Sohul Hossain said, adding that the EC will stick to laws. "We will appoint chartered accountants, if necessary, to scrutinise the accounts and we want to establish the system so that candidates in future elections follow suit." Electoral laws state the candidates must submit returns of polls expenses within 30 days after the election results are published. "It's obligatory not just for the winning or defeated candidates, it's also mandatory for uncontested candidates even in case of no expenses," Sohul said. On the procedure of filing the returns, the election commissioner said: "It's not compulsory to send the returns by registered mail, the candidates can file them at the Commission in person or through agents or through the returning officers." bd
