 Sumon K Chakrabarti New Delhi, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com)  Former Satyam Computer chief Ramalinga Raju and his brother B Rama Raju were arrested on Friday night, after they surrendered. Raju brothers have been remanded to Andhra Pradesh CID's custody. Ramalinga surrendered before the director general of Andhra Pradesh police SSP Yadav, a police official said. Both the co-founders were arrested on charges of criminal breach of trust, criminal conspiracy, cheating, falsification of records and forgery, Andhra DGP told Reuters. Raju, whose whereabouts were a matter of speculation ever since he made the startling disclosure on Wednesday about the Rs 7,800 crore financial fraud, had been in hiding and was summoned to appear before the SEBI on Saturday, PTI reported. Earlier on Friday evening, the government disbanded the current board of Satyam Computer and announced that it would nominate 10 directors on its board. Founder of Satyam B Ramalinga Raju, who has been summoned by market regulator SEBI on Saturday, had resigned as chairman after disclosing staggering financial fraud. Five other directors had also resigned leaving the strength only at three. Announcing the decision, corporate affairs minister Prem Chand Gupta said: "The current board ceases to exist and there would not be any meeting tomorrow... the new board will meet in the next seven days." The government's decisive action came nearly 60 hours after the startling disclosure by Raju, presumed to have strong political friends, that put the company and its over 50,000 employees fate in limbo.
