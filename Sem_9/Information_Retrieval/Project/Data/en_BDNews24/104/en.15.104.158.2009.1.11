<TITLE> No power price hike if systems loss cut: experts </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com)  Experts said on Sunday systems loss of Dhaka Power Distribution Company could be trimmed to 15-16 percent from 22 percent to avert a tariff hike. (More to follow soon) An open discussion on a proposal to raise the DPDC power price 14.77 percent at the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission office in the city observed that the price increase would not be necessary if the current systems loss could be reduced. Petrobangla engineer Tajul Islam said the systems loss could be cut to 15-16 percent. Power Cell deputy director Mizanur Rahman differed. He said trimming systems loss in the rural areas is faster than in the urban areas, which is why price should not be fixed on the basis of systems loss. "But DPDC should set a target for cutting the systems loss," he said. Deputy finance secretary Siddique Zubair said, "DPDC has been made a company to boost its skills which is as important as cutting back on systems loss." "Therefore, less than 14.77 percent rise [in tariff] should be proposed besides reducing the systems loss," he said. DPDC managing director Ataul Masud said, "A quick reduction is not possible. We've set a target to cut the systems loss in three years." BERC chairman Golam Rahman said, "A public hearing on the DPDC proposal on the tariff hike would be held at 11am on Feb. 4." "Prospective participants, individuals or organisations, may apply to BERC by Jan. 22 and send written opinions by Jan. 28," he said. bd
