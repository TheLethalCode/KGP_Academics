 MUMBAI, Jan 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India are in talks with Sri Lanka about staging a one-day series to offset some of the losses from cancellation of matches following the attacks in Mumbai in November, a senior Indian board official told Reuters on Sunday. "Talks with the Sri Lankan board are underway but nothing has been finalised yet," Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) treasurer Mohinder Pandove said. Pandove said he could not confirm whether the proposed series would be played in India or Sri Lanka. "Nothing more can be said about it for now," he added. India's cricket board said it had lost almost $25 million from the scrapping of two one-day games against England and a tour to Pakistan, plus the postponement of the 2008 Champions Trophy. The Indian government refused permission for the tour to Pakistan due to strained bilateral ties after blaming Islamist militants based in that country for the November attacks which killed 179 people in Mumbai. India have no international cricket scheduled until the tour of New Zealand in March
