 Dhaka, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com) - The BNP on Thursday alleged attacks on its supporters by Awami League activists continued in Sylhet, Kushtia and other places across the country. "The Awami League terrorists are still attacking our leaders and supporters and occupying their houses and structures," Rizvi Ahmed, office secretary of BNP, told reporters at the party chairperson's office at Gulshan. The administration and the police had been indifferent to the attacks, he alleged. "The government ministers are saying no attacks are taking place across the country. But our leaders and activists are informing us of attacks on them every day." "They are telling us they cannot stay at their houses, many of them left their homes. Their families are also receiving threats." BNP, which heads the four-party alliance, has been alleging widespread attacks on its leaders and supporters by the AL supporters since its catastrophic defeat in the general election in December. The AL-led grand alliance won a landslide to form government. bdnews24
