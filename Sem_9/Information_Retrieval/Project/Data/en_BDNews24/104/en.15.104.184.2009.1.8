 Rajshahi, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com)  The Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology has suspended all examinations scheduled from Jan. 12 after a clash between two student bodies on Wednesday. Administrative works including admission of first-year students will continue, while residential halls for students will remain open, public relations officer Golam Mortuza said. Mortuza said the decision came from an urgent meeting of university's syndicate, the highest policymaking body, on Thursday following Wednesday's clash. The clash between the Awami League-backed student body Bangladesh Chhatra League and the Jamaat-e-Islami's student front Islami Chhatra Shibir left at least 20 injured, seven of whom were admitted to hospitals. Additional members of police have been deployed on the campus to prevent a repeat, said MK Jahangir Hossain, assistant police commissioner of Matihar Zone. bdnews24
