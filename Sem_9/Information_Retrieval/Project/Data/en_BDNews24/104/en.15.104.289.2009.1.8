 By Arshad Mahmud in Washington Wsahington, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com)Amid growing speculation over why president-elect Barack Obama and his family were denied a request to move in to the presidential guest quarters Blair House, a little earlier than usual, the White House has now revealed that it had done so in order to host a close friend of President Bush who will be staying there later this week.

"We explored the idea so that the girls could start school on schedule," a White House spokesman then said. "But there were previously scheduled events and guests that couldn't be displaced."
