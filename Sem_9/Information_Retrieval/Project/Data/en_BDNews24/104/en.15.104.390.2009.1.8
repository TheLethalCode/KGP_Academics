 Dhaka, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com) - Farmers have been less inclined to potato production this season on a lack of reservation facilities despite a bumper harvest last season, a senior official said on Thursday. "A good amount of potatoes rotted last year due to the lack of cold storage," Department of Agricultural Extension director, field service wing, Dewan Md Intazul Islam told bdnews24.com. "Moreover, the farmers did not get proper prices for potatoes that added to their frustration," he added. The cultivation had been planned on five lakh hectares of land for the current scheme, but potato has been grown on around three and a half lakh hectares, Islam said. The production target for this year has been set at 80 lakh tonnes. According to information of the field service wing of the DAE, 90 lakh tonnes was produced in 5,20,000 hectares. bd
