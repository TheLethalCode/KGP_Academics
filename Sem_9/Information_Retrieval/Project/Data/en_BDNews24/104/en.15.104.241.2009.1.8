 Moinul Haque Chowdhury bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com)The finance ministry has already released Tk 83.78 crore out of the estimated Tk 133 crore earmarked for the Jan 22 Upazila polls.

"Law and order situation will not be aggravated to any alarming degree on the occasion of the Upazila polls, I reckon.
