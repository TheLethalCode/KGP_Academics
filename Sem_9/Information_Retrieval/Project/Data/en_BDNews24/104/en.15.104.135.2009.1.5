<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 5 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League spokesman and joint secretary Syed Ashraful Islam Monday called on party leaders and workers to 'exercise restraint'. He also urged the BNP-led four party alliance to accept the election results. "Actions will be taken against AL leaders and workers involved in any extremist activities," he warned. "And we request the law enforcing agencies to take actions against those involved in illegal activities." The AL leader said extremists inside the party "will not be tolerated". "Stern actions will be taken against the evil-doers." Terming the delay in oath-taking by MPs-elect of the four-party alliance as "obstructive", Ashraful said: "Making a controversy about the election and delaying oath-taking are two sides of the same coin." He asked the BNP-led opposition to accept the poll results and join a forward looking democratic movement. "We are promise-bound to make the parliament centre of all political activities to achieve good governance and ask the four-party members-elect to take the oath as an opposition role is a must for an effective parliament," the AL spokesman said. Ashraful was briefing reporters at the party's Dhanmondi office Monday afternoon on the post-poll situation across the country. "The BNP-Jamaat alliance is trying to meddle with the situation as their cadres have swooped on AL leaders and workers since the election results were announced," he alleged. bdnews
