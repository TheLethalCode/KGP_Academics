<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com)  New commerce minister Faruk Khan has said he believes prices of essentials will fall within people's reach in the next few days. "The prices of essential commodities have started falling in the market in the past few days on the news that the Awami League will form gpvernment," he said at his Secretariat office on Wednesday. "People voted for us based on our pledge and now we must do everything to fulfil our promise," he said referring to the election manifesto. Faruk said those who may try to push the price through syndicate would be severely dealt with. "Syndicates are always aided by someone and this government will not support any such entity." The minister said syndicates did not exist during the previous 1996-2001 AL government. "At that time, all essentials were within the buying capacity of the people and inflation was below 2 percent." "We will make every effort to fulfil expectations of the people," added Faruk. The minister further said he had sought assistance from the business leaders to bring down the prices. They have promised help, he added. Earlier in the morning, finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhit told journalists that cut the price of essentials the government might intervene in the markets, if needed. Commenting on the observation, the commerce minister said, "I do not think intervention will be needed; our business people are honest though some might have resorted to unlawful means under certain circumstances." "The businesspeople have voted us to power and we never look at them with suspicion," he added. "We will not segregate business people into pro-Awami League or BNP. Whether someone is an honest, good business person or not is what should be taken into account." The minister said the matter was clarified by prime minister Sheikh Hasina prior to the election. Faruk hoped the prices of essentials would come down if the government, business community and the media worked together. He further said that the current downward trend in prices in the international market will also help them to curb prices in the local market. bdnew
