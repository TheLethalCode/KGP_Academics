<TITLE> Hayden could retire before Ashes </TITLE>

 Sydney, Jan 09 (bdnews24.com/BBC)- Run-shy batsman Matthew Hayden insists he is undecided over whether to retire from international cricket after being dropped by Australia. Opener Hayden, 37, was overlooked for the Twenty20 and one-day internationals against South Africa but says he is not ready to make a decision on his future. "I'm playing out the summer and taking the energy to get back on the horse or making a decision not to," he said. "It's as clear cut as that. I will take that time because I respect the game." He added: "If mates were telling me, 'mate it's time to go' I would certainly listen to that. But my mates aren't saying that. "The people who do understand the difficulties of our role as cricketers aren't saying that to me. "Ultimately it will be my call to look at the bloke that talks to yourself every day in the mirror and say 'mate it is time to go or saddle up, pull your socks up and get on with it - you've got South Africa and you've got the Ashes'." Hayden will now return to Queensland and believes playing for his state side will ultimately help him decide his international future. The left-hander has an impressive Test average of 51.34 and has been a cornerstone of Australia's all-conquering side since making his debut in 1994. But his form has dipped in the past 12 months with an average of 23.50 in his last seven Tests and no centuries since last January. His recent struggle for runs prompted the Australia selectors to turn their attention to New South Wales batsman David Warner and Queensland's Ryan Harris, a move which Hayden understands. "I'm paid to get runs and when you are short of runs then you have to start asking questions," he said. "This is just to give him time to find some form, in readiness for the bigger event like the T20 World Cup and also the Ashes" But with his long-term future evidently in doubt, Hayden is adamant he will not make any quick decisions. "My immediate future is to go back home to my family and to the people who love me the most and enjoy this time," he said. "It's been a pretty long last four months. It's very difficult to take a breath and get my mind around what my future does hold. "I'm going to take the time to do that. There's a Shield game I want to play. I want to take my time and make a good decision moving forward
