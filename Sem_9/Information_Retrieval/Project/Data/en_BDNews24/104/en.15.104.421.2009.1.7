<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com)  Selectors on Wednesday named rookie fast bowler Rubel Hossain in the 14-member one-day squad for the tri-nation series also involving Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. He was also picked for the squad for a three-match ODI series against Zimbabwe. The tri-nation Cup gets underway on Jan. 10 at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium while the three-match ODI series will start on Jan. 19. Pacer Nazmul Hossain and all-rounder Mahmudullah Riyad, ignored for the Test squad, returned to the one-dayers. Enamul Haque Junior also made a comeback to the ODI side after three years. Off-spinning all-rounder Naeem Islam, who missed the Test series, broke into the side after recovering from an injury. The inclusion of Mahmudullah was expected after his superb performance in the first-class matches where he was the second highest run scorer with an average of 54.61. He also hit four hundreds in the last four games for Dhaka Division. Selectors, however, dropped opener Imrul Kayes, batsman Rajin Saleh, pacers Shahadat Hossain and Sajedul Islam, who were in the Test squad. Rubel, 19 years old, was one of the four pacers in side alongside Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, Mahbubul Alam Robin and Nazmul Hossain "Rubel has performed well for the under-19, Academy and Bangladesh A sides and been impressive in the domestic first class level also. He has extra pace and a deceptive sling-shot action. "He is an attacking bowler and comes in for Sajedul Islam," chief selector Rafiqul Alam was quoted as saying in a press release by the Bangladesh Cricket Board. Nazmul has come in for Shahadat, who has been 'expensive' in the one-day internationals. "Shahadat had been rather expensive in the ODIs he played last year. The coaching staff wanted a steady and accurate bowler and Nazmul fitted the bill. "Shahadat is by no means out of our plans and we believe that returning to domestic cricket will be beneficial for him at this stage and I am sure he will be back in the national side soon," said Alam. "Mahmudullah been rewarded for his batting form. Unfortunately Imrul Kayes had to give way as he has not managed to deliver despite getting opportunities. He will remain in frame though as he is someone we think will perform in the future," said Alam. Regarding taking Enamul in the ODI side despite the bowler not featuring in ODIs for a while, Alam said his experience was one of the main reasons. "We don't have Razzak (Abdur) at the moment so we needed a specialist back up. Besides, Enam's record against Zimbabwe is very good indeed," explained Alam Squad: Tamim Iqbal, Zunaed Siddique, Mohammad Ashraful, Roqibul Hasan, Shakib Al Hasan, Mehrab Hossain Jr, Naeem Islam, Mahmud Ullah Riyad, Mushfiqur Rahim, Masrafe Bin Mortaza, Mahbubul Alam, Nazmul Hossain, Rubel Hossain, Enamul Haque Jr
