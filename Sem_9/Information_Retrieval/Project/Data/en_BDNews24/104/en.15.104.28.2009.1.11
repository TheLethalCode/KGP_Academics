 Dhaka, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com)  Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda in a reverse decision has said the army will be deployed for Upazila polls after all, stressing voting results cannot be overturned with threats. "If there are such incidents then strong measures will be taken," he said on Sunday, adding strict law and order measures would be enforced for the Jan 22 local body elections. Huda said that the initial decision to keep the army out of the election had been reversed. "Being concerned about some post-poll events of aggression after the parliamentary polls, we have taken the decision to deploy troops." The army will perform field level duties from Jan 20 till Jan 24, said the polls chief. The CEC was speaking to newsmen after a law and order meeting, relating to the countrywide elections, held at the National Economic Council (NEC) auditorium at Agargaon. Saying that all preparations have been finalised, he added, "Our main objective is to ensure that voters manage to cast their vote in a peaceful environment and go back home without any worry." The law enforcers entrusted with electoral duties have been ordered to ensure that the verdict of the masses is not distorted in any way, said the CEC. Citing the 87 percent turnout for the Dec 29 election, the CEC hoped that a similar voter turnout would be seen in the local elections. He stressed that extortion and terrorism would have to be prevented at all costs. "We must be cautious that these elements do not resurface with a politically elected government." The CEC praised the judicial magistrates and said that the seven year sentence of a former MP in Debidwar, Comilla, for breach of electoral laws will work as an example. "We encourage such examples." The election chief that within two days one judicial magistrate and an executive magistrate would be appointed to each Upazila. Some 8,131 persons are competing for chairman, vice chairman and reserved vice chairman seats for women in 481 upazilas in the Upazila elections on Jan 22. Of them, 13 candidates have already been elected uncontested, said the CEC.
