 WELLINGTON, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)- Saturday's fourth one-day international between New Zealand and West Indies at Eden Park, Auckland was abandoned because of rain. The visitors were 64 without loss in 10.3 overs with skipper Chris Gayle not out on 46 and Shivnarayan Chattergoon on 17 when they players had to leave the filed for the second and final time due to rain. Martin Guptill smashed a debut century to help New Zealand amass an imposing 275 for four in their fourth one-day international against West Indies at Eden Park in Auckland on Saturday. Guptill batted through the entire New Zealand innings to finish unbeaten on 122, the second highest score by a debutant in a one-day international. The 22-year-old right-hander faced 135 balls, striking eight fours and two sixes, and shared in three valuable partnerships after West Indies had won the toss and invited the home team to bat. He helped put on 68 with Brendon McCullum (26) for the opening wicket, 144 with Ross Taylor (75) for the third wicket and an unbroken 56 with fellow debutant Neil Broom (24 not out) to push the total past 250. Guptill was one of four changes to the New Zealand team that won the third match in Wellington on Wednesday to level the series at 1-1. West Indies won the second game of the five-match series after the opening contest was washed out. Guptill became the first New Zealander, and only the fifth player from any country, to score a hundred in his first one-day international. The record score for a debutant is 148, made by West Indian opener Desmond Haynes against Australia in 1978. Paceman Lionel Baker, one of three changes to the West Indies team, was the best of the bowlers, capturing two wickets for 29 runs in his 10 overs. The final match of the series is in Napier on Tuesday. Scores: New Zealand 275-4 from 50 overs (Martin Guptill 122 not out, Ross Taylor 75) West Indies 64-0 from 10.3 overs (Chris Gayle 46 not out).
