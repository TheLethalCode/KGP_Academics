<TITLE> State to drop Azam J Chy case against Hasina </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 5 (bdnews24.com)  The government has decided to drop an extortion case filed by Azam J Chowdhury in June 2007 against Sheikh Hasina, a day before she is to be sworn in as prime minister. The home ministry sought the opinion of metropolitan public prosecutor Ehsanul Huq Samajee who said legal proceedings to drop the charges would be undertaken after the court settles a writ petition for staying the case. "The government has decided under Section 494 of the Criminal Procedure Code to discontinue the prosecution of case no. 34 dated 13/6/2007 and seeks opinion of the learned metropolitan public prosecutor and necessary actions," said a letter from the ministry to the PP. Deputy secretary (law) of the home ministry Sujayetullah signed the letter that was issued 'by order of the President'. The PP said the petition for a stay on the case was awaiting verdict at the High Court, which must be disposed before the case could be 'discontinued'. Businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury sought to retract the Tk 3 crore extortion case against Awami League president Sheikh Hasina last month ahead of the elections, saying he had not directly sued anyone. Chowdhury, managing director of the East Coast Trading Limited, applied to the home adviser to withdraw the case in court through an executive order. He said it was filed on a "misunderstanding" and was "unexpected and undesired" on his part. The businessman told reporters on Dec 14, "I did not directly file any case. Neither did I name anyone. There was a misunderstanding, which will be over when the case will be withdrawn." Hasina's cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim was also accused in the case; her sister Sheikh Rehana was also included later in the charge-sheet. bdnew
