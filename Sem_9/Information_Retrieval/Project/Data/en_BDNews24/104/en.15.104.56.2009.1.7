 Dhaka, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com)  The government will put in place an honest and efficient administration in line with the people's expectations, LGRD and cooperatives minister Syed Ashraful Islam said on Wednesday. "We will put an end to politicisation of all institutions including the judiciary, Public Service Commission and the Election Commission in order to form an honest and efficient administration in the light of people's hopes," Ashraful told reporters at the Secretariat. "People expect a lot from us. We want socio-economic development to transform Bangladesh into a middle-income country." "We have announced various long-term projects in our election manifesto," the newly appointed minister and Awami League spokesman said on his first day in office. Asked to comment on the rampant corruption in his ministry in the past, Ashraf said: "We'll get to the roots of corruption and those responsible will be taken to task." "Corruption is a devastating disease and we have to uproot it." "Right now, we are faced with three major challenges now  lowering prices of essentials, employment generation and rural infrastructure development," he said. He came down hard on the staffers at the Secretariat, who gave a floral tribute to newly appointed ministers. "The reception given to ministers by putting up banners, chanting slogans and strewing flowers inside the Secretariat is a 'detestable offence'," he said. "A decision will be made through discussions in the cabinet meeting in this regard," the local government minister said. Asked about trial of the war criminals, he said: "The war criminals will have to be tried according to the election manifesto of the party. The countries that have tried war criminals are eager to provide us assistance in this regard." "The foreign diplomats also showed their eagerness to assist in trial procedure when they met with the party president. The legal process will be finalised after we get proposals from them." Ashraf also said: "Some 21,000 AL activists were killed during the tenure of the past (BNP-led) regime." "The terrorists will not be spared. We will probe the killings," he warned. bdnews24.co
