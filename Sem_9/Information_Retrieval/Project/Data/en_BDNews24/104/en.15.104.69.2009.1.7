<TEXT>
 Dhaka, January 7 (bdnews24.com)Denial of space to terrorists and militants was key to reaching development targets, home minister Sahara Khatun said Wednesday. Bangladesh's first woman home minister arrived at her office in the secretariat at 12:45 pm, and was received by the officials on her first day at work. "If we try and find and efface the sources of terrorism and militancy, Bangladesh will not be lagging behind its development goals," Sahara Khatun told reporters. "Only suing terrorists and putting them behind bars are not enough," she said. "To root out extortion, graft and terrorism, we've got to find the sources, the genesis of such vicious cycles and destroy them for good." Asked if the new government would review the cases of 72,000 jailed people who were allegedly harassed for political differences, Sahara said, she would think about it and take it to the cabinet for a decision. Replying to another query, she said, she would see to it that no one was harassed for political reasons. "You've seen me on the streets," she said, adding she would be equally "courageous" as a minister. On the post-polls conflicts and alleged atrocities, the new home minister said, "The law enforcement agencies will see to that." bdnew
