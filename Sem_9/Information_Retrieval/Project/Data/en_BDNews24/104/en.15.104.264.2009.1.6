<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com)  Tillakaratne Dilshan followed up his back-to-back century to grab four scalps as Bangladesh suffered their worse ever defeat in Tests in term of runs to allow Sri Lanka to clinch the two-Test series 2-0 on Tuesday. Bangladesh conceded a massive 465-run defeat, the fifth worst defeat in Tests in term of runs, on the fourth day of the second and final Test in the port city after being summarily dismissed for 158 with a day to go, chasing a huge target of 624. Bangladesh's previous biggest defeat margin in term of runs was against England, who handed a 329-run defeat to the hosts also in Chittagong in 2003. It was apparently an improbable target for the hosts, who made their fourth innings highest of 413, chasing a winning target of 521 set by Sri Lanka in the first Test in Dhaka last week. In contrast with the Dhaka Test, Bangladesh failed to probe their potential to slum in both innings in Chittagong while Sri Lanka piled up big total on the board in both innings on the way to their biggest win in Tests in term of runs. It, however, was Dilshan, who made the difference with superb performance in both the bat and the ball that also awarded him double delight of man of the series and man of the match. The right-handed batsman, who hit 162 in the first innings, struck a swashbuckling 142 in the second innings while Sri Lanka were looking for some one to stand tall against the Bangladesh bowlers. Dilshan was again called by his skipper Mahela Jayawardene, who was desperately looking for a break of Bangladesh's sixth-wicket stand as Shakib Al Hasan and Mushfiqur Rahim gradually grew in confidence with some brilliant strokes after Bangladesh crawled at 52 for five at one stage. Off-spinner Dilshan broke the 92-run stand in his very first over, removing Shakib for a defiant 46 and then dismissed Mehrab Hossain (5), Mashrafee Bin Mortaza (o) and Shahadat Hossain (1) before Mushfiqur Rahman was the last batsman, run out by Chaminda Vaas for 43. The 32-year old all-rounder took four wickets for 10 in his four-over spell. Sensational spinner Ajantha Mendis had earlier rattled Bangladesh's top order dismissing Imrul Kayes (5), Junaed Siddique (4) and Mohammad Ashraful (7). Mendis bagged three to end with a match haul of seven while Vaas and Dilshara Fernando took one wicket apiece. In the morning, Dilshan struck a back-to-back century as Sri Lanka declared their second innings at 447 for six at lunch, stretching their overall lead of 623. Sri Lanka having resumed the day's play on an overnight score of 296 for four added another 151 for the loss of two overnight batsmen with an average of 4.87 per over. Dilshan, who struck 162 in the first innings, converted his overnight score of 81 to 143, his sixth Test hundred, before being bowled by Enamul Haq Junior. The right-handed batsman, who clubbed 14 fours and one six in his 175-ball knocks, put on 145 runs for the fifth wicket with Thilan Samaraweer, who fell to Shakib Al Hasan for 77 off 177 balls that included nine fours. Dilshan also added 86 runs for the sixth wicket with Chamara Kapugedera, who quick-fired 59 off 92 balls with the help of three sixes and one four. Chaminda Vaas played a 25-ball 20 to take Sri Lanka beyond the 400-run mark. bdnews24.
