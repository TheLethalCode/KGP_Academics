 PARIS, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Olympique Lyon resumed their quest for an eighth successive Ligue 1 title in tentative fashion with a 1-1 home draw with mid-table Lorient on Saturday. Brazilian Ederson put Lyon in front from close range nine minutes into their first game after the winter break but Lorient levelled shortly before halftime when midfielder Fabrice Abriel back-heeled home a low Marama Vahirua cross. Stade Rennes moved into second place, two points behind leaders Lyon, by beating Grenoble 1-0 courtesy of a first-half goal by forward Moussa Sow. Fourth-placed Olympique Marseille closed the gap on Lyon to four points, their 2-0 win at lowly Auxerre featuring a goal in each half by striker Mamadou Samasa and midfielder Mathieu Valbuena. Nancy-Nice, Le Mans-Lille, and Valenciennes-Caen were all postponed because of frozen pitches. No new dates have been set. Girondins Bordeaux, in third place level on points with Marseille, will move into second one point behind Lyon with a home win over Paris St Germain on Sunday
