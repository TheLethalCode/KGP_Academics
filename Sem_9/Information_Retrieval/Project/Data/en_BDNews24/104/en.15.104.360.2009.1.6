 Dhaka, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia Tuesday expressed her anger at the post-poll reprisals on BNP leaders and workers, which she said marked Awami League's 'turn for change'. While visiting the bereaved family of the slain Shwechchhasebak Dal leader Nazrul Islam in the city on Tuesday evening, Khaleda gave reporters an account of how her party workers have been 'repressed' since Dec 29 election. "You can see how our party members have been repressed, their houses and offices vandalised and this is how they (AL) have begun their 'turn of change'. Unidentified assailants on two motorcycles open fired on local trader Nazrul Islam on Monday afternoon in the city's Bijoy Nagar area, shooting him the head and chest. Islam died after being rushed to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. Brother in law Jahangir Alam alleged to reporters that Islam was killed as he canvassed for the BNP-led four-party alliance. He said Nazrul Islam earlier filed a general diary with the local police station sensing a threat to his life. Police however said they could not confirm personal or business feuds behind the killing. "Please don't worry. I will always be with and around you as I have always been," BNP chief Khaleda consoled the bereaved wife of the deceased on Tuesday. Mrs Islam, in tears, demanded punishment to the killers of her husband. Khaleda Zia was flanked by BNP leaders and former ministers Mirza Abbas, barrister Rafiqul Islam Mian, former city BNP general secretary Abdus Salam and former student leader Habibunnabi Sohel, among others. bdnews24.
