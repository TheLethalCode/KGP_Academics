<TITLE> Health sector graft complaints occur at lower levels: ACC boss </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 5 (bdnews24.com)  Most of the complaints of corruption and irregularities in the health sector are at the union and upazila levels, said antigraft boss Hassan Mashuud Chowdhury on Monday. "Corruption exists at the top level on a more massive scale, but the complaints come from the lower levels," said the Anticorruption Commission chairman. He made the comments at an ACC meeting on graft prevention with health ministry officials as part of an ongoing initiative to tackle institutional corruption. An earlier meeting, in November, between the commission and the health ministry identified several areas plagued by corruption. Pilfering of medicine in government hospitals, irregularities in purchase of items, appointment and transfer of employees, pension systems and drug licenses were discussed at Monday's meeting along with remedial steps. Talking about gaps in treatment at rural medical centres, he said: "We must ensure that people who come to get medication and treatment braving the cold in winter do not go back empty handed." "Even if you cannot give them medicines, give them an idea about the disease." An official of the health ministry said that corruption takes place as third and fourth class employees cannot be transferred to another ministry. "If this law is remedied then corruption will reduce by half." ACC commissioners Md Habibur Rahman and Abul Hassan Monjur Mannan, health secretary MA Nasiruddin and other officials of the health ministry were among those at Monday's meeting. b
