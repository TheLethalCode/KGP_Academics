 PARIS, Wed Jan 7, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy said on Wednesday Israel and the Palestinian Authority had accepted a truce plan for Gaza announced by Egypt on Tuesday. "The president is delighted by the acceptance by Israel and the Palestinian Authority of the Franco-Egyptian plan presented last night in Sharm el-Sheikh by (Egyptian) President (Hosni) Mubarak," said a statement from Sarkozy's office. "The head of state calls for this plan to be implemented as quickly as possible for the suffering of the population to stop." Israel and Hamas said they were temporarily holding their fire in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday to ease the flow of humanitarian aid and both sides said they were studying an Egyptian proposal for a ceasefire. Earlier one Israeli source said, they planed to halt military operations for three hours a day near the city of Gaza to enable aid. "The idea is for the Israeli military to lay down its weapons every day from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m., starting today, in the area of the city of Gaza," the source said. Palestinian officials in the Gaza Strip said they had been informed by Israel that it would stop its attacks during that time period to allow shops to open and for funerals to take place. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's office said previously, a humanitarian corridor was recommended by Israel's military chiefs and would entail granting periodic access to various areas to allow Palestinians to stock up on vital goods. Aid agencies have complained of a mounting crisis for the 1.5 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Israeli ground forces, which invaded the enclave on Saturday to counter rocket fire by armed Palestinian factions, have bisected the territory and encircled major populated areas. An Olmert spokesman, Mark Regev, described the measure as a "special status to allow the transfer of people, foodstuffs and medicines" and said it could be implemented on Wednesday. International pressure on Israel to halt its 12-day-old assault mounted after tank shells killed 42 Palestinians at a UN school in the coastal enclave. While it ordered a three-hour-long lull in "offensive" military operations to let in aid, Israel said it was considering a major escalation that would push troops deep inside Gaza's cities and refugee camps in their bid to end rocket salvoes into Israel by Islamist militants. In fresh fighting, 12 Palestinians were killed by Israeli attacks in the Gaza Strip, medical workers said. At least eight Hamas rockets hit southern Israeli, causing no casualties. The United Nations called for an inquiry into Israel's deadly shelling of a school in Jabalya refugee camp on Tuesday. Israel said Hamas militants at the school had fired rockets. The U.N. said there were no gunmen on the premises. "There are ongoing contacts with the relevant parties as to the parameters of a sustainable quiet that must include the total cessation of all hostile fire from Gaza into Israel, and the complete ending of arms smuggling into the Gaza Strip," said Mark Regev, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's spokesman. Another Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity, described the Egyptian ceasefire proposal as "a work in progress" and said negotiations were under way over details. Around mid-day, Israel put its military operations in parts of the Gaza Strip on hold, saying the three-hour break would enable aid to flow through a "humanitarian corridor" it had established. Hamas said it, too, would hold rocket fire temporarily. John Ging, director of operations in Gaza for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), said Gaza had become "hell on earth" for its 1.5 million inhabitants and a three-hour lull was insufficient, given their needs. "Let's stop the fighting, not just for three hours but for 24 hours a day," Ging told Sky Television. More than 600 Palestinians have been killed in the fighting. According to UN figures more than a quarter of the Palestinian dead are civilians. A Palestinian human rights group put the figure at 40 percent. Israeli government sources said members of Olmert's security cabinet were likely to defer a vote on starting an urban warfare stage of the offensive, which began with air strikes on December 27 and moved into a ground offensive last Saturday, and give Egypt's ceasefire efforts a chance. A Palestinian official said the Gaza Strip's Hamas rulers, who want an end to Israel's blockade of the enclave, had been briefed in Egypt by President Hosni Mubarak and were debating the proposal. Israel, which has lost seven soldiers and three civilians in the conflict, wants a specialized international force to search out and destroy tunnels along the border between Gaza and Egypt to prevent Hamas from rearming
