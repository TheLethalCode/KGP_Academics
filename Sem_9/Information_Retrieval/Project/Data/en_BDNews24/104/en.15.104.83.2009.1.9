 Comilla, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com) - BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia on Friday called for 'rebuilding the party' from the grassroots, after once again alleging the four-party alliance was forcibly defeated in the Dec. 29 election. "The [caretaker] government and the Election Commission did not work neutrally in the election; they worked in favour of a particular party and alliance," Khaleda told party supporters at Comilla Circuit House, on her way to Noakhali. "BNP was forcibly defeated," said the former prime minister. Khaleda left Dhaka Friday morning to attend campaign rallies for the postponed election to Noakhali-1. Getting into campaign mode, she called on supporters not to be frustrated with the defeat. "The people of the country are with me; we'll rebuild our party from the grassroots after dissolving all existing party committees." "Being united, we'll form the government of the future, winning the next election," said Khaleda. The election to Noakhali-1, which was deferred following the death of a candidate in early December, will be held on Jan. 12. bdnews
