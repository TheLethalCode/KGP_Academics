 Dhaka, January 5 (bdnews24.com)Anwarul Kabir Talukdar, Alamgir Kabir and Moni Swapon Dewan resigned from the Liberal Democratic Party on Monday. "Though the elections are over, the prevalent political crisis is yet to be fully addressed," former state minister Anwarul Kabir Talukdar told bdnews24.com. "I have resigned from LDP as this party's leadership cannot possibly pursue people's welfare and secular politics effectively." All three party presidium members submitted their resignation letters to LDP chairman Oli Ahmed Monday noon. Moni Swapon Dewan, former deputy minister told bdnews24.com, "Personally, I wouldn't like to go bankrupt pursuing a career in politics. LDP, to my mind, isn't in a position to pursue healthy and development-oriented politics. Hence my resignation." The three former ministers of the immediate past four-party alliance government quit BNP on October 27 2006, to form LDP under the joint leadership of AQM Badruddozza Chowdhury and retired colonel Oli Ahmed. Talukdar resigned his ministership protesting massive corruption in the power sector. None of the three contested the just-concluded ninth parliamentary elections. bd
