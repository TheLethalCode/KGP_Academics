 LONDON, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nigel Clough has been appointed manager of Derby County 37 years after his father Brian led them to the English league title, the club said on their website (www.dcfc.co.uk) on Tuesday. Clough signed a three-and-a-half-year contract to replace Paul Jewell, who resigned last month. He will take charge of the Championship (second division) strugglers after Wednesday's League Cup semi-final, first leg against Manchester United. "It's definitely not a sentimental appointment," Derby chairman Adam Pearson told Sky Sports News. "Nigel has created a dynasty of his own over 10 years at Burton Albion." Clough leaves Burton with the minor league club closing in on promotion to League Two (fourth division). The 42-year-old played under his father at Nottingham Forest. He also had spells at Liverpool and Manchester City. Brian Clough, who guided Derby to the league title in 1972 and won the European Cup twice with Forest, is remembered as one of the country's best and most charismatic managers. He died from stomach cancer at the age of 69 in 2004. Derby were relegated to the Championship last year and currently lie down in 18th place. They face Forest, managed by their former boss Billy Davies, in the fourth round of the FA Cup on Jan. 23
