 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh high commissioner to Malaysia M Khairuzzaman, one of the original accused in the Jail Killing Case, will be recalled "to face trial in Bangladesh", says the state minister for foreign affairs. In an interview on Sunday, Hasan Mahmud told bdnews24.com that the ministry "had already discussed the issue of removing Khairuzzaman" who was made envoy by the 2001-2006 BNP-led government. "Awami League is in power now. It cannot be that killers will be serving as envoys," Mahmud said. "First, he will be called back and then he will have to face trial (here)," he said. "We have already discussed recalling him from the mission." Mahmud said the process to bring him back would start soon. Khairuzzaman, a retired major who was charged but later acquitted in the Jail-Killing Case, has denied involvement in the killing. Asked whether he was possibly resigning his post and returning home, he told bdnews24.com from Kuala Lumpur by phone: "I have not got any instruction from Dhaka." Four national leaders, who had been close to independence leader Sheikh Mujib Rahman and had led the government in exile during the 1971 war  Syed Nazrul Islam, Tajuddin Ahmed, M Monsur Ali and AHM Qamaruzzaman  were killed in Dhaka Central Jail on Nov 3. 1975. Khairuzzaman, who had been serving as acting ambassador in the Philippines, was recalled by the past AL government after he was named in the charge sheet of the Jail-Killing Case. He was arrested and forced to retire on Sept. 24, 1996. Soon after the last BNP-led alliance government assumed power, Khairuzzaman was shifted from jail to Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University hospital and then released on bail. On May 4, 2003 he was reinstated as a key director general in the foreign ministry and later promoted as additional secretary. Khairuzzaman was acquitted in the Jail Killing Case by a trial court in 2004. bdn
