 Dhaka, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com)  Newly sworn in prime minister Sheikh Hasina has renewed her pledge to lower prices, saying she wants to ease the sufferings of the people of the country "who have had to overcome much during the last seven years". "This is a great responsibility. People have voted for us with great expectation, we'll have to meet it," Hasina said shortly after taking oath as the prime minister of the newly formed government on Tuesday. Hasina once again renewed her pledges to lower essential prices and maintain law and order. Daughter of country's independence hero Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Hasina was sworn in as Bangladesh's 12th prime minister on Tuesday evening, , along with 31 ministers of her new governmentfollowing the landslide victory of her Awami League-led grand alliance on Dec. 29. On newcomers being picked as ministers, Hasina said, "Repetition of same faces is not good, so we're presenting new faces." "When we formed our last cabinet, there were also many new faces. You'll see more in the future," she added. "We've picked leaders from grassroots," Hasina said. Talking to reporters after the Bangabhaban ceremony, Hasina was asked to express her feelings on being prime minister for the second time. "The people of the country have suffered much during the last seven years, [we'll] have to ease their sufferings," Hasina said. "We left power in the year 2001, with the country's GDP growth at 6.2 percent and inflation at 1.9 percent." "Since then inflation has touched double digits," the new prime minister said. Hasina was asked about her potential first step in support of her party's election manifesto 'Charter for Change'. "Our first task is curbing the spiralling prices of essentials and maintaining a stable law and order situation." She assured farmers, who are growing Boro paddy this season, of fertiliser and other essentials. "Measures will also be taken so that the farmers can get fair prices for their products," Hasina added. Hasina said her grand alliance government will make all-out efforts in developing the education sector. "The people of the country will have higher education opportunities," she said. She hailed the role of the press in the recent past and called on them to continue their role throughout the period of her government as well. "The media role was so powerful during this period. I hope the same role will continue in the future." Hasina thanked the Election Commission, and all the stakeholders in the election, law enforcement agencies and finally all the people for successfully holding a free and fair election. "People's voting right is a constitutional right. All should remain on guard so that none can deprive the people of this right." bdnews24.com/
