 SAN JOSE, Costa Rica, Fri Jan 9, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The death toll from a strong earthquake in Costa Rica rose to 13 on Friday and officials feared more bodies would be found in the rubble of a major landslide. Ten victims were buried by the landslide at the La Paz waterfall, said Red Cross spokesman Luis Guzman. The waterfall popular with tourists is on the flanks of the Poas Volcano. The 6.1-magnitude quake on Thursday devastated the Poas Volcano national park north of the capital San Jose, triggering massive landslides and cutting roads into the park. Three people were reported dead on Thursday: a teenager and two girls selling candy in the park. The government was scrambling to hire private helicopters to bring aid to the region. "There are many buses and many vehicles that are trapped," said deputy public safety minister Jose Torres. About 300 tourists sought shelter for the night in a valley near the volcano after the earthquake. Officials feared additional victims would be found in houses crushed by landslides
