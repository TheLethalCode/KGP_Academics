<TEXT>
 New Delhi, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com)  Subrata Bayen, a top criminal arrested in arms and intrusion cases, secured bail from a Kolkata court on Tuesday. "Police failed to chargesheet him within the stipulated period of 60 days from the day of his arrest. So Mr Bayen was granted bail," said Bayen's lawyer Lalan Singh. None of the police officers was available for comment on the reason behind the delay in pressing charges against him. Subrata is still not out of jail because of some procedural delay, Lalan said. Special Task Force of Kolkata police nabbed him from his hideout at Karaya on Oct. 13, 2008. He was on the list of 23 wanted notorious criminals handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation by the Criminal Investigation Department early last year. Interpol was also hunting him. For the past few years, Bangladesh government has claimed that Bayen has been sheltered in West Bengal. The CID had also nabbed a few more high-profile Bangladeshi criminals like Tanvirul Islam Joy and Harris Ahmed. Bayen earned notoriety as a dreadful killer and an extortionist, and allegedly had close links with the BNP. Police said Bayen was involved in several murders including that of JSD Chhatra League leader Murad. Since then, he has been on the run. Though sentenced to life for Murad's murder in 1991, Bayen's high-profile connections helped him get bail. But he went on with his extortion racket in Bangladesh. A regular visitor to Kolkata, Bayen has been hunted by the Rapid Action Battalion ever since the interim government took charge. Bayen settled down in India with the help of an old friend, a wealthy businessman in West Bengal. He took shelter in the border areas of Nadia and invested a huge sum in fisheries there as well as in North 24-Parganas. Bayen even managed to obtain a fake ration card, a driving licence and a voter ID card to prove himself as an Indian. Before his arrest, Bayen returned from China and police claimed that he had been trying to settle down in Nepal eventually. The court's bail order came just after the Sunday's arrest of four wanted Bangladeshi criminals in Kolkata in connection with the murder of former Awami League MP Ahasanullah Master. Nurul Islam Dipu, sentenced to death by a Bangladeshi court and Wahidul Islam Tipu, and Sahayed Ahmed Majnu, both sentenced to life terms, were arrested on Sunday night in Garia locality in Kolkata. Special Operations Group of West Bengal CID made the arrests. Zakir Hussain Rupak, a convicted murderer of Titumeer College students Union VP Ankhi, was also arrested. Ankhi was murdered in 1999. bd
