<TITLE> Muhit will play in market if syndicates don't act </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhak, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com)  Finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhit says the government will intervene directly into the market and vowed on his first day in office to clamp down on 'business syndicates'. "The main task of the government now is to control prices and, in this regard, a price commission will also be formed," the minister told journalists Wednesday at the finance ministry. All necessary steps will be taken to protect the rights of consumers, he said. "The government intervention will become inevitable if these syndicates fail to keep prices of essentials at rational levels," he said. "Syndication" in business in Bangladesh has become a key problem, he said. "We must break these syndicates and no patronisation of this system will be tolerated." "If they try to escalate prices then the government will import essentials to sell in the market." Muhit said these syndicates could not flourish without political patronage. The minister referred to his recent comment in a talk show concerning the high price of edible oil in the local market when rates tumbled in the international market. "The next day the price per litre of edible oil went down by Tk 20." Muhit also assured a separate food budget, saying, "To determine what commodities have to be imported and when, a separate budget must be formulated." "We must also have a reserve policy," said the finance minister. "However", the minister added, "at this point of time the country has a higher food reserve than any time in the past". He said Bangladesh has to be cautious in view of the current global crisis, and asserted the government will take whatever steps required. The finance minister was unhappy with the pace of Annual Development Plan implementation. "Six months of the current financial year has already passed under the caretaker government and the implementation of the ADP is not satisfactory." Some restructuring will become necessary, said the minister. "I believe that revenue budget and development budget also need to be unified and for that I shall talk at the highest level of government." The minister promised that reduction of interest on bank loans, fixing an exchange rate mechanism for the taka, increase of export and remittance and other economic issues will be given top priority. Steps will also be taken to create as many jobs as possible, find solutions to power and energy crises, the finance minister said. bdnews24.com
