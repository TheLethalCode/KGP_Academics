 Dhaka, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com)  With farewells to advisers of the outgoing caretaker government, the secretariat was getting ready to welcome the new cabinet on Tuesday. The walls of the secretariat offices are reported to be adorned with posters lauding Sheikh Hasina and the new Awami League-led government. "But this is in contravention to the work etiquette of government offices", said a top official asking not to be named. Since Tuesday morning, over 50 cars have been kept ready at the secretariat, some with flag stands and Bangladesh logos, others with just flag stands. Though members of the advisory council started to bid farewell on Monday, all of them attended office on Tuesday. On Tuesday, Anwarul Iqbal, AB Mirza Azizul Islam and Hossain Zillur Rahman took farewell from their respective ministries of local government, finance and education. M Tamim, special assistant to the chief adviser, bade farewell to the energy ministry. bdnew
