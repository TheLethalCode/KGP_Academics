 SINGAPORE, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An ailing Singapore tycoon jailed briefly last year for trying to buy a kidney has received one in a transplant from a hanged murderer, the Straits Times newspaper reported on Saturday. The newspaper said Tang Wee Sung, of the landmark C.K. Tang department store on the city state's swish Orchard Road, was given a kidney donated by gangster Tan Jor Chin, who was hanged at Changi Prison on Friday morning. The transplant took place later that day. Tan, 42, known as "One-Eyed Dragon" because he was blind in his right eye, was found guilty in 2007 of shooting a business associate. The newspaper quoted Tan's mistress as saying the gangster had wanted to donate his organs after his death. Tang, 56, was jailed for a day and fined S$17,000 (about $12,000) for trying to buy a kidney from an Indonesian man last year. Organ trading is illegal in Singapore. The Straits Times said Tang suffers from several ailments including asthma, diabetes and heart problems and had triple bypass surgery last year
