 Dhaka, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com)  Two separate road accidents in the capital, one in which a class seven student was killed, sparked angry protests in Mohakhali and Palashi on Saturday. A rickshaw carrying Masum, a class seven student of Three Star School, was hit by a bus at around 11am at Palashi in Lalbagh. Masum, who police said comes from Rahmatganj, was rushed to hospital where the duty doctor declared him dead. "After the accident, members of the public caught the bus driver and handed him over to police," said SM Shahjalal, deputy inspector of Lalbagh police. Locals also smashed cars in the area to vent their anger, said the inspector. Around the same time, students at Government Titumir College were smashing over 100 vehicles in Mohakhali and surrounding areas on Saturday after a female student was injured in a road accident, said police. The Mohakhali-Gulshan road was unpassable for around two hours and all shops of the area were closed. Traffic resumed at about 11.30am as police brought the situation under control. Police and witnesses said a young student Shamima Islam was hit by a private car while crossing the road near the college at around 9.30am. As the news spread angry students massed on the streets. Injured Shamima was rushed to Mohakhali Metropolitan Hospital. Gulshan police chief Mir Rezaul Hossain told bdnews24.com around noon: "The situation has come under control now. The students have damaged many vehicles, but transport movement resumed after 11:30am." Though Titumir College students claimed that Shamima was a fellow student, police said that she was enrolled at Daffodil University. "The students heard that one of their fellows was killed and went on a rampage," student Abul Kalam Azad told bdnews24.com. Gulshan police officer in charge Mir Rezaul Hossain, however, said: "Shamima has admitted that she is a student of Daffodil University." Titumir College principal said: "The students of the college have been demanding a speed-breaker in front of the college for a long time." Currently an overbridge is under construction on the road. Shamima was taken home later in the day and received a visit from state minister for home Tanjim Ahmed Sohel.
