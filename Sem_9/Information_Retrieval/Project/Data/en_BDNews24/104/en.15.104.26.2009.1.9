<TEXT>
 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com)  The main opposition may not get the post of deputy speaker if 27 BNP lawmakers-elect do not attend the opening session of the parliament, according to the constitution. They have a slim chance of joining the first session of the ninth parliament as they have not taken oath within the constitutional stipulated deadline of six days. As per the constitution, the BNP's lawmakers-elect will now have to take oath from the new speaker who will be elected at the first sitting, when they may be absent. The ruling Awami League in its election manifesto pledged to give the post of deputy speaker to the opposition to make the "parliament effective". "They have missed the bus they should have taken oath either from their own speaker (Jamiruddin Sircar) or the chief election commissioner as per the article 148 of the constitution," Suranjit Sengupta, an Awami League presidium member, told bdnews24.com on Friday. "They are not qualified to enter the house and form the opposition. Because, they must take oath as per article 148 of the constitution if they want to graduate from members-elect to members of parliament," he explained. "They are not eligible to take part in the election of the speaker or deputy speaker. "They will have to wait until a new speaker and a deputy speaker are elected at the first sitting of parliament," said Suranjit, a former adviser to the prime minister on parliamentary affairs. He said the treasury bench now would have to elect a speaker and a deputy speaker and place the ordinances at the first sitting, according to article 93 of the constitution. The article says the lawmakers-elect will have to take oath either from the outgoing speaker or deputy speaker within three days from the official publication of the results of the general election. If they fail to do so, they must take oath from the chief election commission within the next three days. Otherwise, they must take oath from the new speaker within 90 days since the first sitting of the new parliament as per the article 67 of the constitution. If they fail to do that, they would stand losing their membership. Outgoing speaker Muhammad Jamiruddin Sircar in an interview with bdnews24.com on Jan. 3 said he could no longer administer oath to the BNP MPs-elect. He added he could swore them in to office three days into the publication of the official results. The official results were published on Jan. 1. "If they do not take oath from the chief election commissioner within the next three days, they will have to take oath from the new speaker," said Sircar. The article 74 of the constitution stipulates that a new parliament at its first session must elect a new speaker and a deputy speaker. "The BNP could get a post of deputy speaker if the treasury bench amends the constitution and makes a provision for more than one deputy speaker," a former whip told bdnews24.com, preferring anonymity. The BNP's lawmaker-elect M K Anwar recently told the news media that his party's lawmakers would join the first session of the Jan. 25 session. The BNP already accepted the results of the Dec. 29 general elections and showed interest in taking the post of deputy speaker.
