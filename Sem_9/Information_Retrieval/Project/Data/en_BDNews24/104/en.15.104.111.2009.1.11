<TITLE> Afghanistan's Karzai to discuss security in India </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KABUL, Sun Jan 11, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan President Hamid Karzai travelled to India on Sunday to discuss security issues, the fight against terrorism and economic cooperation with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, his office said. Since November's deadly attacks in the Indian commercial capital Mumbai, Afghan-India relations have gained fresh importance. US President-elect Barack Obama has said reducing tensions between Pakistan and long-time foe India should be part of efforts to stabilise Afghanistan. Karzai, accompanied by Foreign Minister Rangeen Dadfar Spanta and his National Security Adviser, Zalmay Rasoul, will discuss "current regional issues" with Singh during the two-day visit. India accuses Pakistan-based militants and "state actors" of mounting the Mumbai attacks, which killed 179 people. Afghan officials frequently have accused Pakistan of harbouring Taliban and al Qaeda fighters to weaken Afghanistan. Karzai's trip comes a day after meeting US Vice President-elect Joe Biden, who on Sunday was in south Afghanistan, where the US military is planning to deploy up to 30,000 troop to reinforce NATO-led forces
