<TITLE> EC won't attend hearings on UZ nominations </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 5 (bdnews24.com)  Election commissioner Sohul Hossain Monday said the EC will not attend hearings in the courts over submission and cancellation of nominations for the upcoming Upazila elections slated for Jan 22. "The Commission is not keen on attending the hearings as the UZ polls will be held under the aegis of the local government ministry, which can attend any hearings through its attorney general," he said at the EC secretariat. The relevant law says a candidate can appeal to the appellate authorities within two days after the returning officer cancels his/her candidacy. "Usually a deputy commissioner is appointed appellate authority. The Commission has nothing to do about the candidates who go to courts after the appellate authorities also cancel their candidacies," Sohul Hossain said. "The local government ministry, if it wants, can appoint the attorney general to attend the court hearings." In reply to a question, the election commissioner said, "By-elections in the vacated constituencies will be held soon." Schedules will be announced after all the relevant MPs-elect vacate the extra seats, he added. "We are waiting for one (Khaleda Zia) of the three party chiefs who has not yet vacated two seats." "Though there is a provision for holding the by-elections within 90 days from the opening day of the first parliamentary session, we'll not wait that long," the election commissioner said. bd
