 KHARTUOM, Wed Jan 7, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sudanese protesters have called for attacks on Americans and other foreigners living in Khartoum during rallies against the Gaza offensive, US officials said Wednesday. Students and religious groups have held small-scale protests almost every day since Israel started the attack on Gaza it says is in response to Islamist militants firing rockets into Israel. The US embassy in Khartoum said some protesters "have made threats against US and other Western citizens in Sudan." At least one speaker at a rally outside the embassy on Monday read out read out a list of places and neighborhoods where Westerners are known to gather, the embassy said. The list included Khartoum's Afra shopping center; Amwag, a Middle Eastern restaurant; and O-Zone, an open air cafe popular with Westerners and rich Sudanese. The threats come against the backdrop of an expected ruling from the International Criminal Court on whether to issue an arrest warrant against Sudan's president over suspected war crimes in Darfur. A senior official from Sudan's Foreign Ministry told Reuters Monday an arrest warrant would fuel anti-Western sentiments already heightened by Gaza and promised to give diplomats advance warning if they were in danger. Sudanese officials have said the global court's case is part of a Western conspiracy against Khartoum, led by the United States, Britain and France. The US embassy said protesters were hoping to hold a large rally in the capital Wednesday or Thursday, and advised its citizens to keep a low profile. The United States advised its staff to stay away from O-Zone cafe in October, saying it had evidence a group called "Al Qaeda in the Land of the Two Niles" had threatened US citizens. The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court asked judges in July to issue an arrest warrant for President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, accusing him of orchestrating genocide in Sudan's western Darfur region. The judges are widely expected to decide on his request in coming weeks. International experts say 200,000 have died since mostly non-Arab rebels in Darfur took up arms against the government in 2003, accusing Khartoum of neglect
