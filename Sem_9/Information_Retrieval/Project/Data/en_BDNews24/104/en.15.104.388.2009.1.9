 MADRID, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news from the Primera Liga ahead of this weekend's matches: Real Madrid forward Gonzalo Higuain has recovered from a bout of tonsilitis which sidelined the Argentine for a week and should be available for the trip to Real Mallorca on Sunday (1600 GMT). Coach Juande Ramos will likely have 23 squad players available, with only Dani Parejo and Guti possible absentees, the club said on their website (www.realmadrid.com), as the champions seek a third straight Primera Liga win. Real defender Sergio Ramos said it was the right decision to bring in Juande Ramos to replace former coach Bernd Schuster last month and the squad was happy with the switch. "It was time for a change in attitude for everyone," the Spain international told reporters. "The new coach is demanding more from us and I think the team is responding and working to achieve its objectives." Barcelona midfielder Aleksandr Hleb is still recovering from an ankle injury and the Belarussian missed training again on Thursday, the club said on their website (www.fcbarcelona.cat). French defender Eric Abidal has flu and will rest until Saturday, the club added, suggesting he will be unavailable for the leaders' match at bottom side Osasuna on Sunday (2000). Sevilla defender Jose Angel Crespo said the squad is not affected by recent fan criticism of coach Manolo Jimenez ahead of Saturday's match at Deportivo Coruna, who they beat 2-1 in their King's Cup last 16, first-leg clash on Wednesday. "We are not thinking about that, but simply about getting the win on Saturday," he told the club's website (www.sevillafc.es). Valencia defender Miguel Monteira has apologised for his aggression toward match officials following his sending off in Wednesday's King's Cup match against Racing Santander. "I was upset because I felt helpless and it was not a foul but nothing justifies my reaction," he said on the club's website (www.valenciacf.com). "I want to apologise to the referee and his assistant for getting angry and for having said some things I regret." Atletico Madrid will be missing suspended defenders John Heitinga and Luis Perea as well as midfielder Paulo Assuncao for Sunday's match against Athletic Bilbao at the Vicente Calderon (1600), the club said (www.clubatleticodemadrid.com). All three players were booked in the 3-1 defeat to Valencia at the Mestalla last weekend. Atletico President Enrique Cerezo said fans who called for coach Javier Aguirre to be sacked following Tuesday's 3-1 King's Cup first-leg defeat to Barcelona were not being fair. "It's not right that they are calling for the head of Javier Aguirre when we are one of the teams taking part in a lot of competitions," he said on the club's website. "We have a magnificent team, some sensational players and a good coach
