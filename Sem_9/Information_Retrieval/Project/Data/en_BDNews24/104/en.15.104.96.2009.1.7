 NEW DELHI, Wed Jan 7, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India will keep all options open to dismantle `terror outfits' after the Mumbai attacks in November, the Indian defense minister said Wednesday. "Even after 26/11 (the date of the Mumbai attacks) there is no serious attempt to dismantle the terror outfits and that is the major worry," A.K. Antony told reporters in New Delhi. "We will do everything to prevent this. For that we are examining all possible available options." "What option we are examining I can't tell you now." The latest statement comes as Indian officials show increasing frustration at what they see as Pakistan's unwillingness to fully probe the attacks. India blames Pakistan militants for the coordinated strikes in November by 10 gunmen that killed 179 people and have revived tension between two nations that have fought three wars since 1947. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh accused Pakistan on Tuesday of "war hysteria," saying November's Mumbai attacks must also have had support from some of its nuclear-armed neighbor's official agencies. Pakistan denies any involvement by state agencies
