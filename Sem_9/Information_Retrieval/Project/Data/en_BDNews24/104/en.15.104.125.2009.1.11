Khokon was later rescued from the spot and taken to Chittagong Medical College Hospital, where he died. Police arrested construction workers Md Murad, Idris and Belal Sheikh on suspicion of their involvement with the death. Minara Begum, Majhi's wife, filed a murder case with Halishahar Police Station accusing seven persons.
