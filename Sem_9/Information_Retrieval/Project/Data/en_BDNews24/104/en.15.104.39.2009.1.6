 Dhaka, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com)  Rushed appointments, transfers and promotions carried out at the fag end of the caretaker government have raised questions, outgoing adviser Anwarul Iqbal admitted on Tuesday. "The appointment of a chairman of an organisation and his abrupt removal just four days later, without the approval of the concerned ministry, is unfortunate," the adviser told bdnews24.com. Wahid Ullah Mollah was appointed chairman of the interim management committee of the Bangladesh Milk Producing Cooperative Union (Milk Vita) on Monday, replacing Ferdous Ali who had been appointed to this position just four days earlier. When registrar of cooperatives, Masud Elahi, was contacted, he refused to talk. Between the declaration of the schedule for the 9th parliamentary election and oath taking of the new government, a former adviser has been appointed as chairman of Biman's Board of Directors, 14 officials have been promoted to additional secretary from the post of joint secretary and a new Khatib of Baitul Mukarram Mosque appointed. Abdul Muyeed Chowdhury was appointed new chairman of Biman Bangladesh Airlines after Mahbub Jamil, special assistant to the chief adviser, resigned from the post on December 27. Muyeed Chowdhury was an adviser to the 2001 caretaker government. In addition, he held posts as a secretary, chairman of NBR and managing director of Biman. The day after the general election, on December 30, 14 joint secretaries were promoted to additional secretary. Opinions have been mixed about such decisions, and allegations of irregularities and doling out personal favours have been there. "The government has the right to carry out such changes at the last minute and there aren't any legal complications," former adviser Dr Akbar Ali Khan told bdnews24.com. The appointment of the chief adviser's press secretary as ambassador to Indonesia, just five days prior to the hand over of power, has also been criticised. Syed Fahim Munaim flew to Jakarta, unannounced, to take up his post as ambassador to Indonesia on Jan 1. "There is no problem with such an appointment but the ambassador-designate sudfdenly left Dhaka instead of bidding farewell to the chief adviser," commented a secretary level official asking not to be named. "Such behaviour causes suspicion." bdnews24.
