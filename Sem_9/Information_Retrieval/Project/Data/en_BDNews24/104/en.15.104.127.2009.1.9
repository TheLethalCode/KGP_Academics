 GUWAHATI, India, Fri Jan 9, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - One person was killed and five others wounded on Friday when separatist militants triggered a powerful bomb blast in Assam, police and witnesses said. Police said the bomb was planted on a bicycle in a crowded market in Maligaon area of Guwahati, the biggest city in the region. "We suspect it is the handiwork of the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA)," P.C. Saloi, a senior police officer said, referring to the main separatist group operating in the region. Eyewitnesses said people were angry at authorities for failing to control the growing militant attacks.
