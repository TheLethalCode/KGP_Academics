 Dhaka, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com) A case was filed at a Dhaka court Tuesday against former inspector general of police Md Ashraful Huda and acting principal of Sheikh Borhanuddin College, Kamrun Nahar Ahmed, on charges of embezzling over Tk 13 crore from the college. Assistant professor of the college Md Farid Hossain filed the case with Dhaka metropolitan special judge against Huda who is also president of the College. Another accused in the case is former vice principal Jane Alam Sikhdar. Judge ANM Bashir Ullah fixed a hearing date for Jan 21. Plaintiff Farid Hossain told the court he protested after he came to know about the huge misappropriation of funds. Under different heads, the accused embezzled over Tk 13 crore, alleged the plaintiff, adding that an investigation committee was formed by the education ministry to probe their misappropriation of funds and other corruption. That committee had proof of the embezzlement, he said. Hossain told the court that Kotwali police had refused to accept the case as had the Anticorruption Commission. The plaintiff requested the court to issue arrest warrants against the accused. bdnew
