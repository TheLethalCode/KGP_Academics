 Dhaka, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh's transition from an unprecedented two-year interim administration ends Tuesday when a newly elected government led by Awami League is sworn into office. Bangabhaban is all set for the ceremony, scheduled for a 6.30pm start, to be attended by more than a thousand guests including a five-strong BNP team. President Iajuddin Ahmed, who on Monday formally invited Hasina to head the government as majority leader, will swear in the new government. Five BNP lawmakers-elect led by Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury will attend the ceremony, party officials said on Tuesday, though the opposition led by BNP have yet to take their oaths as MPs. The head of the outgoing caretaker government Fakhruddin Ahmed, who led the country through many twists and turns on its two-year journey to the Dec 29 elections, has said he is happy with the "smooth" handover of power. "This is a great achievement for the people of this country," he said during a farewell meeting with the president on Monday. Reviewing the major achievements of his administration, Fakhruddin pointed out, "When the caretaker government took over, the law and order situation was delicate and, in the last two years that has been brought to a level of normalcy." "On December 29, this government held a free, fair and transparent election." "We created an environment in which people could go to polling centres and cast their votes without fear." "Hopefully, the new government will lead the country forward, and as a citizen of the country I expect that the present state of law and order will persist," Fakhruddin said. The swearing in ceremony on Tuesday evening will complete the handover of power to a new government in which the hopes of the people are riding high. Sheikh Hasina's Awami League won the people's mandate with a landslide victory on Dec 29, her alliance winning 262 of 299 seats in the country's first general election in seven years. The 'smoothness' of the power handover, however, has one hitch: the opposition, led by BNP chief and two-time former prime minister Khaleda Zia, have called foul over the election results and have so far refused to take their oaths as members of parliament. Most analysts say the crushing defeat of BNP and its allies was the people's verdict against the four-party alliance's immediate past rule marked by allegations of massive corruption and apparent patronage of war criminals and militants. The four-party, however, has blamed "unprecedented vote rigging". Two year journey Khaleda stepped down on Oct. 28, 2006 at the end of her five-year term leading a four-party coalition government. But violence broke out countrywide as the then opposition AL-led 14-party alliance declared a total boycott of the general election scheduled for Jan. 22, 2007 over fears of vote rigging and a controversy involving the head of the caretaker government Iajuddin Ahmed. The election was postponed and president Iajuddin was forced to declare a state of emergency on Jan. 11. He then resigned as the head of the caretaker government, though he remained chief of state. On Jan. 12, 2007, Fakhruddin Ahmed was sworn-in as chief adviser of a new army-installed caretaker government, which passed an emergency rules ordinance the following day and coming into force on Jan. 26. With the country alternating between fears of a total army takeover and hopes of election, Fakhruddin finally lifted the two-year state of emergency on Dec. 17, with little disruption, making way for what most observers say was the freest, fairest and most credible election in Bangladesh's history on Dec 29. AL's promise of 'Change' AL's promise of 'Change' won the overwhelming mandate of the people in a vote that saw a record-breaking 87 percent turnout. Some, however, have voiced fears of "parliamentary autocracy" with the incoming treasury bench having won such a an overwhelming majority in the house. The AL-led government must avoid the pitfalls of such an all-out victory. It also remains to be seen how they will negotiate with an opposition that refuses so far to take up their seats in parliament. These are the immediate challenges. The future ones have been mapped out by AL in its manifesto, which includes the party's Vision: 2021, setting high expectations. Following two years of emergency and the first general election in seven years, and pledging a far-reaching 'Charter for Change', the new government has much to live up t
