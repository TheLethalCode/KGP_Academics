 NEW YORK, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US first lady Laura Bush has agreed to publish her memoirs with Scribner, the publisher said on Monday, giving the normally soft-spoken former librarian a chance to offer her views on the Bush presidency. The book is expected to be published in 2010, said Scribner, an imprint of publishing giant Simon & Shuster, itself part of CBS Corp. Scribner said it would offer "an intimate account of Laura Bush's life experiences, including eight years in the White House." The publisher did not reveal terms of the deal, though publishing experts have said she could command a multimillion dollar advance. Susan Moldow, Scribner's executive vice president and publisher, negotiated the agreement with Washington lawyer Robert Barnett, Scribner said. Barnett is known for brokering publishing and media deals for heavyweight politicians including Bill and Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and President George W. Bush's former aide Karl Rove. Laura Bush said in a statement through Scribner she would "tell the stories of the extraordinary events and people I've met in my life, particularly during my years in the White House.
