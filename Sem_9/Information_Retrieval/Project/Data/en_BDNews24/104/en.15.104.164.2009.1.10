<TITLE> No risk for Jamuna bridge in next 100 years: Abul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Sirajganj, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com)  Communications minister Syed Abul Hossain has discounted the possibility of any safety risks for heavy vehicles on Jamuna bridge after it developed minor cracks. "All vehicles including the heavy ones are easily plying the bridge and there will be no difficulty in the future as well," he told reporters while visiting the spot on Saturday. "The bridge is now 10 years old and there are no risks in coming 100 years." Abul said, "It is normal that small cracks develop in concrete architectures, which can be repaired through regular maintenance work." He inspected the cracks in between the 36th and 37th pillars identified by bridge authorities. The minister said he had been instructed by prime minister Sheikh Hasina to inspect the bridge and promised "immediate steps" for the repair. "We've earned Tk 1200 crore in toll in 10 years and will earn another Tk 2800 crore in coming 15 years to reach the break-even." "All the loan will be repaid in 25 years. Then the bridge will be a gold mine." Asked about the previous BNP-led government changing the name of the bridge, the minister said the bridge is known to people as 'Bangabandhu Bridge'. "If the name was changed by a decision, it can be changed back by another decision." Communications secretary Tanvir Shakil Joy, Bangladesh Bridges division secretary Mostak Ahmed and chief engineer Rafiqul Islam accompanied the minister. bdnews2
