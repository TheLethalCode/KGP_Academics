<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Jan 3(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The government may call in the army to help restore fuel supplies crippled by a strike by employees of state-run oil firms, Petroleum Secretary R.S. Pandey told reporters on Friday. "Where they have expertise, they will be working," Pandey said when asked whether troops may be used. "Wherever necessary, central forces will be deployed." He said the government had appealed to workers to end their stoppage, which ran into its third day on Friday, as the country could not afford a strike. Pandey said some power generating units had also been affected. Petrol pumps in major cities have run dry and flights at key airports delayed.
