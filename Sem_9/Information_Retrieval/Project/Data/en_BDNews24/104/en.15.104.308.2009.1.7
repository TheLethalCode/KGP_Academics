<TITLE> US using China as financial `windshield': report </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIJING, Wed Jan 7, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Developing nations have served as `windshields' to a US economy battered by the global financial maelstrom, yet it is blaming them for a problem caused by its own policies, China's state media said on Wednesday.
