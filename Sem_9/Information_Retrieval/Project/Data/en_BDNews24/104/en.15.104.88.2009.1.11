 DURBAN, South Africa, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Graham Ford is interested in the England job following the midweek sacking of Peter Moores, the Kent coach said on Saturday. However, the former South Africa supremo told Reuters he would only accept the position if he was certain the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) had canvassed the opinions of the players. "Anybody would be interested in being coach of England but I would need to find out more," Ford said from his Durban home. "I'm not the kind of person to make a decision overnight and being involved in the West Indies (tour later this month) would certainly be a rush job. "I would need to know things are right and, most importantly, the team gets the right people involved from their point of view. If I were to be considered the ECB would have to do their homework and make certain the players are fully behind me." Moores lost his job after falling out with Kevin Pietersen, who also resigned as England captain in midweek to be replaced by Andrew Strauss. The 48-year-old Ford coached South Africa from 1999-2001. He won eight of 11 series but was dismissed after being beaten home and away by Australia. INTERNATIONAL HINT Ford joined English county Kent in 2004 and, although he has one year to run on his contract and another offer is on the table, he hinted the time may be right for a return to international cricket. "I wouldn't mind being back on the big stage and I've been a part of the English system for a while. I've worked with a couple of the England players," he said. "To do well at international level you need to have been coaching for a long stint and I think I've got that experience. "I have a fantastic relationship with Kent, they've been absolutely brilliant and I've enjoyed my time immensely with them. They've been really supportive ... and I don't think they'd stand in my way if I wanted the England job." said Ford
