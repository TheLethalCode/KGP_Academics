 New Delhi, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said on Tuesday that Pakistan was whipping up war hysteria, and that the Mumbai attacks must have had support from some official agencies within its nuclear-armed neighbour. "Today even as Pakistan engages in whipping up war hysteria, our nation remains steadfastly united and if anything the process of national consolidation is becoming stronger," Singh told a security conference in New Delhi. "The terrorist attack in Mumbai in November last year was carried out by a Pakistan-based outfit, the Lashkar-e-Taiba." "There is enough evidence to show that, given the sophistication and military precision of the attack it must have had the support of some official agencies in Pakistan," Singh added. The coordinated strikes in Mumbai by 10 gunmen killed 179 people, and have revived hostilities between the two countries that have fought three wars since 1947. India handed over evidence on Monday to Pakistan that it said linked Pakistani militants to the Mumbai attacks, including data from satellite phones and the confession of a surviving attacker.
