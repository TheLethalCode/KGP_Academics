<TITLE> Time to forgive Ghaly, says Spurs boss Redknapp </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tottenham Hotspur manager Harry Redknapp has urged supporters to forgive Hossam Ghaly at Tuesday's League Cup semi-final first leg against Championship (second division) side Burnley. Egyptian midfielder Ghaly was booed by Spurs fans as he warmed up among the substitutes in the FA Cup win over Wigan Athletic on Friday, and did not get on for what would have been his first appearance for the club since May 2007. On that occasion he was substituted 30 minutes after coming on as a sub himself and reacted by throwing his shirt to the ground as he stormed off the pitch. "I didn't know the full story but I don't think he was being disrespectful to Tottenham," Redknapp told Tottenham's website (www.tottenhamhotspur.com). "He'd been subbed as a sub and was annoyed with the manager more than anything. It wasn't right that he threw his shirt down but the kid made a mistake and we all make mistakes. It's time to forgive and forget." Injuries and suspensions mean Ghaly is likely to be among the substitutes again on Tuesday. Redknapp is without Jermaine Jenas and Benoit Assou-Ekotto, who are suspended, while Darren Bent (groin) and Tom Huddlestone (ankle) are also missing and Ledley King will again be rested. The other semi-final first leg takes place on Wednesday when Derby County face Manchester United
