<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com)  A 'Constitution review committee' is urgently needed for amendment or annulment of the debated article 70 of the constitution, and also to determine the future status of the caretaker government, said speakers at a roundtable on Sunday. "We expect this government will lead the country towards a consolidated democracy," said SUJON president Mozaffar Ahmed at the roundtable on 'Establishing Democracy and Good Governance'. Article 70 of the Bangladesh Constitution says: "A person elected as a member of Parliament at an election at which he was nominated as a candidate by a political party shall vacate his seat if he resigns from that party or votes in Parliament against the party." The article is thought by many to impede the true spirit of democracy and a functional parliament. Rehman Sobhan, chairman of Centre for Policy Development, called upon all concerned to work towards rendering the Jatiya Sangsad effective. SUJON secretary Badiul Alam Majumder pointed out: "The backdrop of our original Constitution has undergone major overhauls. The constitution too has been amended and elaborated on occasions, which, at times were inconsistent with the spirit of our independence war." "We consider it necessary and opportune to convene a 'Constitution review committee' so that changing or repealing Article 70 may be debated and resolved," said the SUJON secretary. He mentioned an upper house of parliament, proportional representation, and future of the caretaker government system as other urgent issues to address. He also suggested shrinking the prime minister's secretariat: "It's not necessary to have a 'super heavy' prime minister's secretariat when there is a really effective cabinet form of government in place. A skeletal PM's office should suffice." SUJON, or Sushashoner Jonnyo Nagorik (Citizens for Good Governance), organised the roundtable at the National Press Club Sunday. Other issues touched on were speedy trial of war criminals, shedding of party affiliation by the speaker and deputy speaker, formulation of a lawmakers' code of conduct, a parliamentary ethics committee and establishing strong local government institutions. Newspaper columnist Syed Abul Maksud, lawyer Hamida Hossain, former privatisation commission chairman Inam Ahmed Chowdhury and former foreign state minister Abul Ahsan Chowdhury were among those who spoke. "The new government in their party's election manifesto had articulated their commitments prior to the polls. We hope they will implement them all," said SUJON president Mozaffar Ahmed. bdnews
