 Dhaka, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com)New, "untainted" faces will dominate the Awami League-led cabinet, set to be sworn in Tuesday evening. A medium-sized council of ministers will include MPs from allied parties, but Sheikh Hasina's party will retain the key portfolios. A senior official spoke of over 30 cars ready for the new ministers, indicating the initial size of the new council of ministers. "Taking lessons from the past, the leader (Sheikh Hasina) has dropped those who are tainted by (various) allegations," said one top aide to the AL chief. "And of course, competence in terms of governance and ability to deliver has been taken into account," the aide said of the list of the Cabinet, carefully kept under wraps. Top cabinet posts will go to the tested and more experienced hands such as Matia Chowdhury and Syed Ashraful Islam, but faces like Tanjim Ahmed alias Sohel Taj, son of the Mujibnagar government prime minister Tajuddin Ahmed, will breath fresh air into the team. Western educated and politically tested Dr Dipu Moni tops the list of women who will be given important portfolios, alongside the likes of advocate Sahara Khatun. Barrister Anisul Islam Mahmud and GM Quader looked sure to represent key AL ally Jatiya Party in the cabinet. But Mahmud, a former foreign minister when General HM Ershad was in power in the 1980s, is unlikely to go to the Segunbagicha office this time. Abdul Jalil, a former commerce minister in the previous Hasina administration, and Abul Maal Abdul Muhit, a former finance minister in the 1980s, could be the other notable names on the cabinet list. The quartet of (Abdur) Razzaq, (Amir Hossain) Amu, Tofail Ahmed and Suranjit Senguptapopularly known as RATSare widely predicted to be the most of prominent absentees from the Cabinet. They also held senior Cabinet or cabinet-level positions in the 1996-2001 government. HT Imam, who led the well-orchestrated campaign that gave the party the stunning victory, was tipped to head the list of technocrat ministers. Also included in the likely list was Dr Moshiur Rahman, a former ERD secretary and a long-time AL supporter since retirement many years ago. bdne
