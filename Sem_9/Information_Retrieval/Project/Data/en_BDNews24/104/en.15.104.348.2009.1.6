<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 5 (bdnews24.com)  Five special courts that have been transferred to Dhaka Judges Court premises in the old city from the Jatiya Sangsad building were officially 'back in action' on Monday though no hearings were held. "Special courts-1, 3 and 5 had no case for hearing on the day," special public prosecutor Mosharraf Hossain told bdnews24.com. And, although special courts-2 and 4 had hearings scheduled, they could not hold them as the cases in question were stayed, said Mosharraf. Of the two cases, one was the Barapukuria coalmine case against Khaleda Zia and others. But the judge could not accept the case for hearing as the High Court has imposed a stay order on the proceedings. Another was a case filed by Hamza Chemical Ltd. But, Judge Yasmin Anwar re-set the hearing date to Jan. 14 on a petition by defendants. The parliament building was cleared of the "special courts", which tried corruption suspects over the past two years under emergency powers rules, just five days before the Dec 29 parliamentary election. The law ministry sent a letter to the parliament secretariat for their removal and relocation. Out of the 10 special courts, set up following the declaration of the state of emergency on Jan. 11 last year, five have been shifted to the district court premises in old Dhaka. Chittagong and Khulna will host two courts each while one will be relocated in Rajshahi. bdnew
