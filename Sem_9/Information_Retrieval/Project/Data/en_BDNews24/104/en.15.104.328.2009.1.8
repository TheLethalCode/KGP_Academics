<TITLE> Prices will fall below people's expectations: Faruque </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com)  Commerce minister Faruque Khan on Thursday said he believed the runaway prices of essentials would come down even more than what people expected. "The prices of daily essentials have begun falling, almost to the people's expectation and will come down further, even more than the people's expectation," he said after visiting kitchen markets in the city's Karwan Bazar. Faruque expressed his hope that the prices would come down by next one month. The new Awami League-led government had declared a drastic price cut the "number one task". Faruque cited 'business syndicate' and 'extortion' as among the reasons behind the spiralling prices. "There were syndicates and extortion in the markets that pushed the prices up. Still there are syndicates, but they will not be able to do anything in the future," he said. He said he sorted out a few more reasons behind the price hike during his visit to the markets: price hike in the international markets, fixing the prices in dollar after import, and shipment costs. "We're observing the international markets. We're discussing how the businessmen can sell their commodities profiting not more than 10 to 12 percent," Faruque said about the government's consideration to check selling commodities at irrational prices. The government, being a democratic one, however, does not want to control the market. It only wants to make sure that the prices are reasonable, he said. Quoting businessmen he had talked while visiting the Karwan Bazar, the commerce minister said none was extorting money from the market now. "We've come to know that extra transportation cost and extortion also add to the price hike. These will not happen in the market," Faruque said. Asked why prices are not coming down in retail markets despite low prices in the wholesale markets, he said, "We'll take further actions for that." The minister gave the businessmen his cell phone number and asked them to report should there be extortion and 'syndicate' in the markets. A businessman told him that businessmen who had hoarded commodities to make hefty profits sold those off after the new government was sworn in, causing the prices to come down. Faruque also met with the business leaders after visiting the kitchen markets. It was learnt that edible oils, rice, flour, sugar and some other essential commodities were cheaper in last few days, but the prices of vegetables rose. bd
