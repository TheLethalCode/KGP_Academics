<TITLE> Israel, Hamas ignore truce calls; Gaza death toll over 800 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 GAZA, Jan 10(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli tanks advanced on Gaza and Hamas militants fired rockets at Israel on Saturday, as both sides ignored international calls to stop the conflict and Israel warned it would escalate its assault. An Israeli tank shell killed eight Palestinians in Jabalya, a refugee camp in the north of the Gaza Strip, and an air strike killed a woman in nearby Beit Lahiya, Palestinian medics said. All of those killed in Jabalya were believed to be men from the same family. The Israeli army denied carrying out any attacks in the area. The deaths, including those of several Palestinian gunmen, raised the Palestinian toll to at least 821, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. Thirteen Israelis have been killed: 10 soldiers and three civilians hit in rocket fire. The fighting continued even during a three-hour ceasefire window Israel has established in recent days to allow aid into Gaza to sustain the 1.5 million people living there. As Israeli tanks advanced in northern Gaza and aircraft hit targets across the coastal strip, Hamas rockets hit Ashkelon, 20 km north of Gaza, wounding three Israelis. The Israeli military also dropped leaflets on southern Gaza, around the town of Rafah, warning residents to stay away from militants, weapons storage facilities and tunnels as it was about to escalate its bombing throughout the coastal territory. "In the coming period, the Israeli army will continue to attack tunnels, weapons caches, and terrorists with escalating force all over the Gaza Strip," the leaflets read. Concerned about the deepening humanitarian impact of the war, with more than half Gaza's population dependent on U.N. food assistance, the United Nations said it hoped to resume full aid distribution after receiving Israeli assurances that its staff would not be harmed. A U.N. driver was killed on Thursday. Israel has pressed on with its offensive despite a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire and Egyptian-European efforts at mediation, saying it is intent on stopping Hamas rocket fire. Hamas, too, has ignored calls for a halt to hostilities, firing eight rockets at Israel on Saturday. A phalanx of Israeli tanks advanced from the north towards the city of Gaza, creeping in on the large refugee camp of Jabalya, home to around 100,000 people. EGYPTIAN EFFORT FALTERS In an attempt to breathe life into a faltering Egyptian-led mediation effort, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, whose Fatah party is a political foe of Hamas, met Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak for talks in Cairo. They discussed the possible deployment of international forces along the Gaza-Egypt border under any ceasefire deal, but Abbas said they should be in Gaza itself, not along the border. Privately, diplomats believe the Egyptian initiative, also sponsored by French President Nicolas Sarkozy, is in trouble, even if Israel has said talks about the proposal will continue and Hamas has sent representatives to Cairo. "There is a growing sense that the Egyptian-French plan is not going to work," a senior European diplomat told Reuters. Following talks with Abbas, Egypt said it would not accept foreign troops on its side of the 15-km border with Gaza to prevent arms smuggling. But Germany, whose foreign minister also met with Egyptian officials, said it would send experts to help assess Egypt's police training needs to bolster anti-smuggling efforts. Israel says the Egyptians have failed in the past to prevent Hamas building up an arsenal of Soviet-designed missiles. As with the Egyptian initiative, the U.N. Security Council resolution late on Thursday calling for an immediate ceasefire appears to have little traction with Israel or Hamas. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert dismissed it as "unworkable" and Hamas officials in the Gaza Strip said they objected because they had not been consulted. U.S. BLAMES HAMAS The United States, which abstained in the U.N. vote, offered further public support for Israel's military goals. "This situation will not improve until Hamas stops lobbing rockets into Israel," White House spokesman Scott Stanzel said. He said President George W. Bush had expressed concern to Olmert about the humanitarian situation and the loss of civilian lives during the Israeli assault on the Gaza Strip. With the Palestinian civilian death toll already in the hundreds, Israeli actions have drawn denunciations from the Red Cross, U.N. agencies and Arab and European governments. U.N. sources said Israel also was stepping up operations in the West Bank, detaining Palestinian suspects in rising numbers. Hamas wants any ceasefire deal to include the ending of Israel's crippling economic blockade of the Gaza Strip and the withdrawal of all Israeli forces from the territory, from which Israel withdrew in 2005 after a 38-year occupation. Israel's key demands are for a complete halt to Hamas rocket fire and for international guarantees to stop the group rearming via smuggling tunnels under the border with Egypt.
