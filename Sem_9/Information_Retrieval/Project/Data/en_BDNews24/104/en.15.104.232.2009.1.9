 Pabna, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com)  A 12-year-old girl, daughter of a local Awami League leader, was raped and killed allegedly by BNP activists on Thursday night at Gabgachhi in Sujanagar Upazila, police said. Rubayet Bunte Rakib Hridi, the victim, was daughter of local Krishak League general secretary Rakib Al Kuddus. "A group of terrorists kidnapped Hridi from her home, took her to a nearby place on Thursday night and raped her to death there," Sujanagar Police officer in charge Azizul Islam told bdnews24.com. Police recovered the body and sent it to Pabna General Hospital for autopsy on Friday morning. Islam also said they had already arrested local BNP activist Younus Ali, 22, and Rawshan Ara of the same village in this regard. "Some BNP terrorists killed my daughter in an act of reprisal after their defeat in the election last month," said Rakib AL Kuddus. Police said they were investigating the incident. "I campaigned for (Awami League candidate retired air vice marshal) AK Khandaker despite pressure from rivals not to do so." Kuddus said. Local BNP unit denied any involvement. "It had nothing to do with election defeat," said Upazila BNP general secretary Selim Reza Habib, a former MP who lost to Khandaker. "Only terrorists are to blame." Rape and murder charges were filed with police, the officer said. bdnews
