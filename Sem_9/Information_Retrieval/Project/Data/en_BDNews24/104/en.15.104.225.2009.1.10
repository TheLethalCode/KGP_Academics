 Arshad Mahmud in Washington Washington, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com)The son of former Liberian dictator was sentenced Friday to nearly a century in jail by a court in Miami for his role in orchestrating the deaths and torture of his father's enemies. Federal District Judge Cecilia Altonaga sentenced the son, Charles McArthur Emmanuel, also known as Chuckie Taylor, to 97 years in a federal prison for torture and conspiracy to torture involving seven victims and the use of a firearm in a violent crime. His father, Charles Taylor, is awaiting trial in The Hague on war crimes charges. Emmanuel, 31, who was born in the United States, was convicted under a law enacted in 1994 that allows prosecution of citizens for acts of torture committed overseas. Legal analysts say that the conviction of Emanuel is expected to serve a strong message around the world that America is not a safe haven for those who commit such crimes abroad, and even sons of leaders may be prosecuted. During months of testimony, witnesses recounted how Emmanuel, the head of Liberia's notoriously violent Antiterrorist Unit from 1997 to 2003, ordered punishments like electric shock, red-hot irons and even biting ants on prisoners during interrogations. "It is hard to conceive of any more serious offense against the dignity and lives of human beings," Judge Altonaga said before sentencing Emmanuel. Born in Boston, Emmanuel spent most of his life in Orlando, with his mother, stepfather and older sister. He went to live with his father in Liberia as a teenager, a few years before Taylor won the presidential election in 1997. He was arrested on charges of carrying a false passport when he arrived in Miami from Trinidad in March 2006. In his final statement to the court before sentencing, Emmanuel maintained his innocence, though he expressed remorse for the victims on both sides of Liberia's civil war. "I am sorry, my brothers and sisters, for what has happened to you during the conflict," he said, turning to those in the courtroom who were torture victims and the families of those killed during the 14-year civil war
