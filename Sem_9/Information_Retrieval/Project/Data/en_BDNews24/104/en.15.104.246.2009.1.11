 BIRMINGHAM, Alabama, Sun Jan 11,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Depressed about the global economy, unemployed, or just looking for adventure? Then look no further because a tiny Australian island is offering a dream job, advertising globally to find the right person. It involves spending six months immersed in the culture and beauty of the Great Barrier reef island of Hamilton and promoting its tourism through a video blog. Duties include feeding ocean fish, cleaning a pool and collecting deliveries of mail that arrive by plane but the employee is also required to go scuba diving, snorkeling and hiking and to enjoy at least 25 nearby island resorts. To offset the drudgery, the state of Queensland is offering 150,000 Australian dollars ($105,000), accommodation in a luxury three-bedroom house and transportation to and from the island. No skills or experience are required for the job that starts in July and there is no age requirement. "We are looking for someone who is dynamic, charismatic and interested in the world of barrier reefs," said Shana Pereira, Tourism Queensland's Regional Director for the Americas. Queensland created the job as an antidote to the global economic slump and is advertising in 18 countries including the United States and China, she said. Applicants must submit a one-minute video expressing interest in the Great Barrier Reef, a vast coral reef system that is classed as one of the seven natural wonders of the world. "It is such a fantastic opportunity, I wish I didn't have a conflict of interest or I would apply," said Pereira
