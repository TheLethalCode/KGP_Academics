 Dhaka, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh look to get back on winning ways when they take on Zimbabwe after two years in the opener of the Tri-Nation Cup on Saturday at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur. Bangladesh had clinched the four-ODI series 3-1 though Zimbabwe fought back to level the series 1-1 at one stage, and will want to keep up the momentum. The four-match Tri-Nation Cup opener is apparently crucial for Bangladesh and a win will mean the hosts will take a step ahead in the final of the tournament, which also features favourites Sri Lanka. In head- to-head statistics, Zimbabwe are still ahead of Bangladesh, who had won 15 games in 33 matches they played against them. But the fact that Bangladesh had won nine of the last 10 games against Zimbabwe gives them a slight edge. However, Bangladesh captain Mohammad Ashraful does not want to take Zimbabwe lightly and said they were concentrating on their performance ahead of the match. "We always try to do better in every international match we play. I think Zimbabwe are not weak opponents as their players have been playing together for four years. "So we have to perform in all three departments if we want to have a better result against them," said Ashraful at a pre-match press briefing in Mirpur on Friday. He said Bangladesh have a balanced squad for one-day internationals and they had a good record in ODIs after 2006 with some memorable victories in the World Cup. The top-order is a cause for concern for the hosts as the batsmen failed to failed to live up to their billing in the recently concluded Test series against Sri Lanka. "We have our more experienced players at the top. I am pretty confident that they will do the job. The test team is a lot different, has a lot of new faces. They haven't played a lot of matches. I am confident our top four will do a much better job than they did in Test cricket," said coach Jaime Siddons. Siddos also thinks his side is better than Zimbabwe. "I'm confident like I was against Ireland. I think we are a better side. "I'm confident in the preparation and we have the best team we can put in the park. "But the players have to deliver on the day. Given our ranking, given opposition in one-day cricket at the moment, given that we are improving as a team, I am pretty confident. Still we have to play good cricket to win the game," said the Australian coach. Siddons is also thinking about how to stop the Zimbabwean batsmen early. "We have got some visual to show. Their batsmen will attack early; we know that so we need to be prepared for bowling in the right areas. Yes, we need to bat well, bowl well and field well than they do." Bangladesh have kept rookie pacer Rubel Hossain and left-arm spinner Enamul Haq Junior out of the 12-man squad for the tournament opener. Zimbabwe captain Prosper Utseya is also not thinking except a win. "We played against Sri Lanka (in November), took a lot of positives before coming to Bangladesh. We are confident of doing well here. Our target is to play really well and win every game that we play," said Utseya after two hours of practice in Mirpur. "I think the guys are more experienced now than they were two years ago. We should be more consistent. With the way we played against Sri Lanka they put two spinners against us, the guys are more confident coming here and play against spin." said the 23-year old captain. Utseya also said Zimbabwe and Bangladesh were starting the tournament on a par and the team that would play the best cricket would be in the final. Bangladesh 12: Tamim Iqbal, Junaed Siddique, Mohammad Ashraful, Roqibul Hasan, Mehrab Hossain Junior, Shakib Al Hasan, Naeem Islam, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mahmudullah, Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, Mahbubul Alam Robin and Nazmul Hossain. Zimbabwe: Prosper Utseya (Captain), Elton Chigumbura, Graeme Cremer, Keith Dabengwa, Hamilton Masakadza, Stuart Matsikenyeri, Christopher Mpofu, Tawanda Mupariwa, Forster Mutizwa, Raymond Price, Edward Rainsford, Vusimuzi Sibanda, Tatenda Taibu (Wicketkeeper), Malcolm Waller, Sean William
