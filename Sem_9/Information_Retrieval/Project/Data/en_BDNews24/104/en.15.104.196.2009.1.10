 Chittagong, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com)  An industry policy will be formulated soon for protecting interests of workers and owners, the industry minister said on Saturday. "Chittagong, the commercial capital, lost its pride during BNP-led four-party alliance government. We will restore it again," Dilip Barua said at a public meeting at Laldighi Maidan. The meeting was held on the occasion of the anniversary of the return of independence hero Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Jan. 10, 1972 after the liberation war. "It is high time that we realised dreams for economic emancipation that Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman dreamt all his life," he said. Shipping minister Afsarul Amin, Chittagong City Corporation mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury, lawmakers Mosharraf Hossain, Akhtaruzzaman Chowdhury, Anisul Islam Mahmud, Shamsul Haq Chowdhury and MA Latif, among others, spoke. They all promised to work together against terrorism and make the country free of corruption. "We have to work together from our respective positions whatever those are," said Amin. "People's expectations will be reflected on our activities." Mayor Mohiuddin presided over the meeting. Four government ministers and 12 lawmakers elected from the greater Chittagong were to attend the rally but one minister and five lawmakers were absent. Party insiders said they skipped the rally because of internal squabbling, and rifts with the mayor. b
