<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com)  Elton Chigumbura struck his eighth one-day half century to take Zimbabwe to a moderate 205 for nine against Bangladesh in the Tri-Nation Cup opener at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur on Saturday. Chigumbura struck a timely 64 after Zimbabwe had crawled to 94 for five caught in a spin web by Shakib Al Hasan and Naeem Islam, who both bowled superbly to return three wickets each. The 22-year old middle-order batsman struck five fours and one six facing 95 balls before being run out in the final over. Put in to bat first, Zimbabwe opener Hamilton Masakadza along with Vusimuzi Sibanda gave the hosts a scare or two, hitting strike bowler Mashrafee Bin Mortaza for four in the third delivery and then striking debutant paceman Mahbubul Alam two successive fours in the next over. The opening pair threatened to pick 21 runs in the first four overs before pace spearhead Mashrafee made the inroad in the fifth over. The paceman pitched a good length ball on the offstump that cut back to get a thick inside-edge off Masakadza before dropping into the safe hands of Shakib Al Hasan at leg square. Right-handed opener Masakadza played a 17-ball 16, studded with three fours, before leaving the side at 23 for one after 4.4 overs. After this, Bangladesh pace trio  Mashrafee, Mahbubul and Nazmul Hossain  struggled to find their lines and lengths, and captain Mohammad Ashraful brought in-form Shakib to attack in the 13th over with the left-arm spinner bringing dividends to his captain in his very third delivery. Shakib trapped Vusimuzi Sibanda leg before for 15, reducing the visitors to 53 for two before Stuart Mastikenyeri and Tatenda Taibu went on for a threatening third-wicket partnership. Off-rhythm first-change pacer Nazmul Hossain conceded 24 runs for four overs before he was replaced by off-spinner Naeem Islam. Debutant Mahmbubul Alam was also cost the hosts, giving away 66 runs in his 10-over spell with no success. Naeem broke the third wicket having Taibu caught by Mashrafee for a 19-ball 18 in his very second delivery and then removed Mastikeneri for 39 in the next over, with Zimbabwe slipping to 94 for five in 22.2 overs. Occasional leg-spinner Ashraful and left-arm spinner Mehrab Hossain also joined Naeem and Shakib to give the Zimbabwean batsmen a tough time as the visitors struggled to make just 64 runs in 25 overs. Chigumbura, however, kept his cool to steer Zimbabwe beyond the 200-mark leaving no doubt that Bangladesh failed to cash in on the early collapse with some shaky fielding. Zimbabwe picked up 50 runs in the last five overs at the cost of just two wickets. b
