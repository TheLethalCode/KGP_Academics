<TITLE> Reckless Tigers stunned </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com)  Reckless batting and sloppy fielding cost Bangladesh heavy as they went down to Zimbabwe by 38 runs in the Tri-Nation Cup opener at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Saturday. Bangladesh were skittled out for 167 with 22 balls to spare in reply to Zimbabwe's moderate total of 205 for nine in the stipulated 50 overs. The Tigers now teeter on the brink of missing out on the finale. The defeat means Bangladesh have a slim chance to get to the four-match tournament final following a final group match against favourites Sri Lanka on Jan. 14. Bangladesh top-order once again failed to justify their potential against a feeble bowling attack, which has no recognised bowler. The batsmen took the pressure early on themselves and went for their shots before settling in. Shakib Al Hasan, however, kept his cool to concentrate on singles and reached 52, his fourth ODI fifty before being the seventh Bangladesh batsman out, leaving the side at 126 for seven in 34.2 overs. The left-handed batsman, who was also successful with the ball to return three for 23, struck only three boundaries in his 66-ball innings. Bangladesh's hope of reaching the target was buried when Shakib edged Elton Chigumbura behind to wicketkeeper Tatenda Taibu. The inevitable defeat was hastened with Bangladesh losing their last three batsmen for 41 runs. A quick 28-ball 22 knock from tailender Mahbubul Alam entertained the crowd amid the gloom. Tamim Iqbal took nine off Zimbabwean strike bowler Edward Rainsford in the opening over and captain-cum-offspiner Prosper Utseya brought himself in in the next over. The gamble paid off as he got opener Junaed Siddique out for a two-ball duck. However, TV replays showed the ball was drifting away from the left-hander's althoigh umpire Billy Doctrove gave Junaed the marching orders. Mushfiqur Rahim, promoted up the order for his skill against spin, negotiated Utseya well in next four deliveries, but he fell in the next over to Rainsford while leaving a good length ball that clipped his off-stump. At 10 for two in 2.3 overs, Mohammad Ashraful, along with Tamim, started confidently and hit three eye-catching boundariestwo off Rainsford and the other off Utseya. But a misunderstanding separated them in the 12th over. Tamim was denied twice by Ashraful and fell a few metres short of the crease, and Bangladesh slipped to 32 for three in 11.1 overs. When he only needed to concentrate on singles to ease the pressure, Ashraful went for a big shot two balls later and was caught at long-on by Elton Chigumbura off Utseya, whose first seven-over spell read 7-3-13-2. Ashraful played a 20-ball 17 hitting three boundaries. Shakib along with Roqibul Hasan steadied the innings with fine running between the wickets, but Roqibul (23) lost his concentration against Keith Debangwa, who broke a defiant 59-run fifth-wicket stand in the 26th over. Mehrab Hossain Junior went unnecessarily down the wicket against Raymond Price and was stumped by Taibu to leave Bangladesh wobbling at 95 for six in the 27th over. Despite six wickets down, Bangladesh were still in the hunt with Shakib and Naeem Islam on the crease, but the departure of Shakib dashed all hopes. Both Naeem and Mashrafee Bin Mortaza were run out for 23 and three respectively, before Mahbubul Alam played the wirlwind innings that only reduced the margin of defeat. Alam was the second victim of Price. Chigumbura had earlier struck 64, his eighth one-day fifty, to take Zimbabwe beyond the 200-mark. Zimbabwe collapsed to 94 for five in the halfway of the innings, but Bangladesh failed to cash in on the slump due to some shaky fielding by the hosts in the end. The visitors racked up 50 runs in the last five overs though Shakib and Naeem took three wickets each for 23 and 32. Mashrafee took two wickets for 41. Chigumbura, surviving two run-out scares, struck five fours and one six facing 95 balls before being run out by Mushfiqur Rahim in the final over. bdnew
