 Dhaka, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh observed the Ashura on Thursday commemorating the Karbala's tragic incidents that took place on Oct. 10 in 680 A.D. On this day, Imam Hussain, the grand son of Prophet Muhammad, was assassinated by the forces of his opponent Yazid (10 Muharram of the year 61 in Arabic calendar). Muslims, especially the Shia sect, around the globe observe the day to remember the tragic deaths of the Imam and his followers in Karbala. The Shias, as a symbol of their solidarity with fighters of Islam, traditionally lash shackles on their bodies to shed blood for the martyrs of Islam. The day, known as Ashura, is a public holiday in the Sunni-majority Bangladesh. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina gave a message on this occasion. "The holy Ashura is a historic day for Islam and the human being. The killing of Imam Hussain is a heart-rending incident and has given the day a special status. "The holy Ahsura has taught us not to bow down to injustice, torture and unfainess," Hasina said. Like previous years, the Shia community in the city brought out a condolence procession, known as Tajiya Michhil, from the Hussaini Dalan in the old part of the city. The processionists carried token tombs of Imam Hussain and his brother Imam Hasan. They cried, "Oh Hussain, Oh Hasan" and paraded New Market area before disperong in front of Riffles Square in Dhanmondi. Some followers cut their bodies with knives to shed blood. They mourned the deaths of the Imam and his followers, beside the Dhanmodi Lake in front of the Rifles Square. Drinks and money were distributed among the poor and destitute. The processionists later immersed the token tombs of the Imams into the Dhanmondi Lake. Tajiya processions were also brought out in Mirpur-1, Rampura, Lalbagh and Pallabi areas in Dhaka. "I come to take part in the Tajiya Michhil every year as I nurture the memories of Imam Hussain and Hasan," said Solaiman Hossain, a resident of Lalbagh. Muslim devotees also offered special prayers in the mosques in the city. The Ashura was also observed in the port city of Chittagong. The Chittagong devotees observed the day through different programmes including taking out Tajiya processions. The Imam Hussain's followers brought out Tajiya processions from Halishahar, Masterpool, Sadarghat Imambagh and Jhautala bihari colony. Some Muslim devotees fasted and distributed food among the destitute. Special prayers were offered in many mosques in the port city. Discussion meetings and prayers also took place.
