 Wellington, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com)- New Zealand batsman Jesse Ryder will miss the fourth one-day international against West Indies in Wellington on Saturday because of "inadequate preparation", reports Cricinfo.

The injury occurred in Christchurch the morning after New Zealand's ODI series win against England and it later emerged that he was also out drinking until 1.30am on the eve of a game. He had to undergo surgery and was sidelined until September. Ryder apologised to his team-mates at training for his latest indiscretion.

"I thought I had reached the point where I could control my drinking better, but that is obviously not the case. "I am only now starting to appreciate the size of the challenge that I face. I am totally committed to overcoming this problem and understand I will have to work even harder with the support group around me." The five-ODI series against West Indies is currently level at 1-
