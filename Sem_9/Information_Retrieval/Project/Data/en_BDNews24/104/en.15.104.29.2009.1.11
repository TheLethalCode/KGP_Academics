 LYON, France, Sun Jan 11, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The youngest Briton to scale Mount Everest has died climbing France's Mont Blanc, French police said on Sunday. The bodies of 21-year-old Rob Gauntlett and his climbing companion were found on Saturday morning. "These two climbers fell about 600 metres for an unknown reason when they were climbing the Gervasutti corridor on the east side of Mont-Blanc du Tacul," said an official at the Chamonix police station. Gauntlett was 19 when he became the youngest Britain to reach the summit of Everest, the 29,000-foot (8,850 metre) Himalayan mountain, in 2006
