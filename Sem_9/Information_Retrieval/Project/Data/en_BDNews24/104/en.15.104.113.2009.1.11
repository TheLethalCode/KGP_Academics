 Dhaka, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com)  Ugandan striker Idris Kasirye struck Citycell B. League's fifth hattrick as Rahmatganj MFS came from behind to crush Khulna Abahani Krira Chakra 4-1 in their away encounter at Khulna Stadium on Sunday. Hosts Chittagong Mohammedan Sporting Club thrashed Farashganj Sporting Club 3-1 at MA Aziz Stadium in the port city. The fifth victory in 13 outings took giant-killers Rahmatganj to the sixth position on the 11-team point table with 17 points. Chittagong Mohammedan were rooted to their fifth place with 23 points, also from 13 matches. Farashganj, who held Chittagong Mohammedan to a goalless home draw, slipped to the seventh position with 16 points from 13 games while Khulna Abahani remained at the bottom of the point table with three from 14 games. Hosts Khulna Abahani, who went 3-1 down to Rahmatganj, led the first half with a 12-mimute strike from Manjurul Islam but failed to keep the momentum in the second half in the face of Idris onslaught.
