 Dhaka, Jan 11 bdnews24.com)  The US and UK have sought assistance from Bangladesh to get back around $200 million the BNP-led government had allegedly taken in bribes to award work orders to different companies. "The US and UK have sought our assistance in getting their money back. The transaction took place in exchange for getting work permit to various companies. We assured them of providing assistance," law minister Shafique Ahmed told reporters after a meeting with the delegation of the two countries at the Secretariat. "The law ministry, finance ministry, attorney general's office and Bangladesh Bank should work jointly in assisting them to recover the money," he said. Deputy chief of US Department of Justice Linda M Samuel, Federal Bureau of Investigation agent Deborah Heprevotte and UK Institute of Management consultant Ferdous Ahmed met with the law minister. Shafique said the money was estimated at $200 million. "There are allegations against the former prime minister's [Khaleda Zia] son Arafat Rahman Coco and one dozen ministers and leaders of the four-party alliance that they took that amount of bribe," he said. The money is currently in the banks of 20 countries including Singapore, the UK and the United Arab Emirates, he said. The US and UK have already moved to recover their money, the minister added. The US government has moved to recover funds worth US$ 3 million allegedly obtained by Coco and kept with a Singapore-based bank, a top justice official has announced. "The forfeiture action was filed Jan. 8 2009 in the U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia against funds located in Singapore held by multiple account holders," a Justice Department statement said Friday. b
