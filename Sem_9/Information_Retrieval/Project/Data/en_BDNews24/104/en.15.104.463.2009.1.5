 Dhaka, Jan 5 (bdnews24.com)The new government must ensure rights of 1.7 million Bangladeshi workers abroad years who have earned the state $17 billion in the past two years, said foreign affairs and expatriate welfare adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury on Monday. "We have expanded the labour market abroad and successfully executed memoranda of understanding with five new nations for labour export," the outgoing adviser said of his ministry under the caretaker government's tenure. "Political rights of our expatriate workers have been realised, so that the future governments may ensure the welfare of our workers abroad," he told reporters after a farewell meeting at the overseas employment and expatriate welfare ministry The outgoing adviser said the next government must remember that the wage earners abroad are not just remittance senders but Bangladeshi citizens and their rights must be guaranteed. Asked by reporters to evaluate the caretaker government's two years, Iftekhar said, "It's not our job to evaluate, our duty has been to discharge the responsibilities entrusted." "I've personally been pleased to be able to function in a coordinated manner during the last two years as the foreign affairs and expatriate welfare adviser to the caretaker government." "I'm especially happy to let you know that I was able to recruit workers from the 'monga' ridden region and send them abroad for wage earning." Iftekhar said new labour markets had been created abroad for Bangladeshi workers in the past two years. Asked what Bangladesh's foreign policy should be in the near future, the adviser said, "Our foreign policy should chiefly safeguard our sovereignty and help steer the country's economy towards prosperity, maintaining good relations with neighbours all through." The adviser said the new government has to keep the above principles in mind and hold dialogues with concerned stakeholders, as necessary. "Bangladesh is now a stable country. Future governments will have to watch carefully so that stability is not threatened again." Bangladesh is scheduled to become a temporary member of the United Nations Security Council in 2015, he added. bdnew
