 Dhaka, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com)  The nation led by Awami League marked the 37th homecoming anniversary of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country's independence architect, on Saturday. "The people of the country dream of a democratic and modern Bangladesh," said prime minister Sheikh Hasina, daughter of Sheikh Mujib, in her message to mark the day. Hasina called on the people to establish her father's dream of 'Sonar Bangla' or a Golden Bangladesh. The Dec 29 parliamentary election in which the party won a landslide victory "reflected that dream", she said. President Iajuddin Ahmed, in his message to mark the day, said: "The country's independence hero returned to the country on this day after the victory of the liberation war." "After armed struggle and untold suffering, the people of the country received back their great leader among them." On this day in 1972, Mujib made a triumphal return to the new-born state from jail in Pakistan, where he was held during the war that brought Bangladesh into existence in Dec. 1971. The Pakistan army arrested Mujib on the night of March 25 1971 just after his declaration of the independence of Bangladesh. 'Bangabandhu' or 'friend of Bangladesh', as he is fondly called, returned home from the Pakistani jail via London and New Delhi. The day is known as Homecoming Day. PROGRAMMES In the morning, prime minister and Awami League president Sheikh Hasina paid floral tribute at the grave of her father and AL founder, first as the head of government and then as the party chief along with her ministers, lawmakers and party leaders. AL's associate organisations also paid their respects at the portrait. Also marking the 37th anniversary of Bangabandhu's homecoming to a newly independent Bangladesh, party members were visiting in Gopalganj, to pay tribute at the graves of Muijib and his immediate family members who were assassinated in an August 1975 military coup. Floral tributes were laid at Mujib's grave in Tungipara on behalf of daughter and prime minister Sheikh Hasina.. "The father of the nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman returned to the country on this day. People had a true taste of freedom that day," said commerce minister Md Faruque Khan as he placed floral wreaths, while other AL leaders were also present. Awami League and its associate bodies held numerous programmes to observe the day, including a main discussion programme at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre, attended by the prime minister. bdnews24.com/sum
