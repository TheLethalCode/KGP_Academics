 CANBERRA, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia's military has experienced a surge in recruitment as the global financial crisis hits home and the government warns of higher joblessness, a newspaper reported on Tuesday. Defence enlistment numbers jumped by almost 20 percent over the three months to December, easing a recruitment crisis that forced the navy to take an extended Christmas holiday, the Australian newspaper said. "Over time, the Australian Defence Force could expect to recruit high-quality applicants and retain those already serving for longer periods," a military spokesman told the newspaper. Australia has been late to feel the full brunt of the global financial crunch and the centre-left government remains hopeful the country can avert a recession gripping major world economies. Prime Minister Kevin Rudd ordered a $7.4 billion pre-Christmas economic stimulus targeting poorer families and pensioners as the country's 17-year economic expansion showed signs of ending. Unemployment moved up from 33-year lows and some economists warned one million people could be out of work by the end of this year prompting many to turn to the military. Australia's air force showed a 27 percent increase in job applications up to December compared to the previous year, while the navy saw a 22 percent jump and the army 15 percent. Critical personnel and recruitment shortages in November forced the navy to order a two-month Christmas vacation, while the air force said it was looking at a scheme to borrow civilian airline pilots for new tanker and early warning radar aircraft. The 50,000-strong military last year launched an expensive drive for new recruits with forces stretched by overseas deployments in Iraq, Afghanistan, Solomon Islands and East Timor. Australia has already begun a 10-year, $43 billion defence modernisation, with new missile destroyers, amphibious assault ships, missiles, tanks and helicopters adding to an air force plan to buy 100 stealth fighter aircraft
