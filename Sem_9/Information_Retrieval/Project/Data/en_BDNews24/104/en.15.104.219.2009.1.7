<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com) The High Court has deferred the final hearings for the fifth time on petitions by Sheikh Hasina to quash two corruption cases to Feb 15. The HC bench of justices Sheikh Rezwan Ali and Md Roisuddin gave the order on Wednesday after Hasina's lawyer appealed for more time. The court also ordered authorities not to arrest or harass Hasina, who took office as Bangladesh's prime minister Tuesday, in barge mounted power plant and the Niko graft cases till the appeals were resolved. Earlier the HC deferred the date on Nov 23. After the court order, barrister Rafique-ul-Huq told bdnews24.com, "The HC has deferred the hearing of Hasina's appeal to cancel the two cases till Feb 7. The court also ordered authorities not to arrest or harass Hasina till the appeals are resolved." The HC on Oct 27 extended a stay order with regard to the two cases. The Supreme Court on Aug 13 upheld a HC order staying the trial of the two cases in the lower court. The HC had halted their trial on July 7 for two months and ordered the government and the Anticorruption Commission to show cause as to why the two cases should not be ruled illegal. The ACC filed a case against Sheikh Hasina and six others on Sept 2 2007, on charges of taking Tk 3 crore in bribes in the name of the Bangabandhu Memorial Trust in exchange for contracts to set up three barge-mounted power plants. The ACC filed a case against Sheikh Hasina and six others on Dec 9, for causing the state losses to the tune of Tk 13,600 crore through awarding contracts without tender to Canadian oil-gas exploration company Niko Resources Ltd for developing three gas fields at Chhattack, Kamta and Feni. Charges were later pressed against nine people in all.
