 Dhaka, January 6 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court Tuesday upheld a High Court stay on a government order barring Chittagong City Corporation mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury from taking up his duties as mayor and allowing M Monjurul Alam to stand in. Chamber judge of the Appellate Division Tofazzal Islam passed the order on a civil petition for a stay of the HC order filed by the government. Deputy attorney general Mainuddin Ahmed moved the petition, while barrister Amirul Islam and advocate Harisadhan Dev Brahmman appeared for Mohiuddin. The HC, on a petition filed by Mohiuddin, on Dec 4 stayed the government order for three months that barred the mayor from taking up his duties and allowing Monjurul Alam to act as mayor in his stead. On Oct 13, senior assistant secretary of the LGRD ministry issued an order barring Mohiuddin and allowing panel mayor Monjurul to function as mayor of the Chittagong City Corporation. bdnew
