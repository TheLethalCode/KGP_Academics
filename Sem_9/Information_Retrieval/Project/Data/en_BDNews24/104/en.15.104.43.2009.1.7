 SYDNEY, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand crushed West Indies by seven wickets in their third limited-overs one-day international at Wellington on Wednesday. The Kiwis cruised past the West Indian total of 128 with almost 30 overs to spare to level the five-game series at 1-1 with two games to go after the first match was washed out. New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori was named man of the match after capturing four wickets as the West Indian batting crumbled. Shivnarine Chanderpaul top scored with 45 but only three other players made double figures. New Zealand had no real problems reaching their victory target of 129 with Ross Taylor helping himself to a half-century with an unbeaten 51 off 50 balls
