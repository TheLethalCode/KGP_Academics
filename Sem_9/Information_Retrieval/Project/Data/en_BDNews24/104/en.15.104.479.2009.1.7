<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com)  Agriculture minister Motia Chowdhury, taking up her new office on Wednesday, said the new government wants to reduce agricultural production costs. "I believe that the prime minister will give a declaration regarding this," she said. Referring to the unreliable power situation and dependence on diesel for irrigation, the minister said that the new government will take steps to help producers overcome these obstacles. "As a result, fuel cost will come down for farmers." The minister, mentioning the Boro cultivation season had started, said: "We shall try to boost food reserves." We do not believe in the idea of the previous government of importing food for meeting a deficit, she commented. "We left the government with surplus food stocks and this time too we want to move in that direction." The newly appointed minister said that the new government wants to industrialise agricultural products and develop agro-based industries. "Our aim is to combine agriculture and industry and thereby create new jobs," said Motia. "We also want to ensure right to food and food accessibility," she added. bd
