 By Arshad Mahmud Washington, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com)The US capital has many attractions - Lincoln memorial, Jefferson memorial, the Smithsonian and, of course, the White House. But on Sunday it added another attraction, albeit temporarily - the Hay-Adams Hotel, just across the White House on 16th Street. To be sure, there's nothing spectacular about the hotel and from outside it looks just like any other surrounding building. But it does have a reputation of being aristocratic, and built in 1920, it's one of the oldest in town. However, from Sunday evening, hundreds of visitors and curious onlookers have thronged the temporary security barricade put up alongside the Hay-Adams, expecting to catch a glimpse of its new occupantspresident-elect Barack Obama and his family. The Obamas moved to Washington from their home in Chicago a little early in order for their daughters, Malia and Sasha to attend Sidwell Friends, their new school on the first day after Christmas vacation on Jan 5. As bdnews24.com readers may recall, the Obamaswanted to stay in Blair House, the presidential guesthouse, where incoming presidents-elect and their families normally check in five days before the official inauguration on Jan 20. But the White House turned down the Obamas' request on grounds that Blair House was booked because of other scheduled events and wouldn't be available before Jan 15. As word spread that Obama would check in at the Hay-Adams from Jan 4, crowds began to gather outside from early evening until a black limousine with tinted glass pulled up in front of the hotel entrance with a cavalcade of security personnel in tow. With a brief glance out his car window - barely visible through cordons of Secret Service officers, black SUVs and security barricades - the president-elect bid a brief hello last night to the town he will now call home and to his new neighbours. There were no speeches, no ceremonies or official welcoming committees. Instead, Obama, a man famous for his no-drama persona, arrived in the nation's capital in a similarly subdued fashion. Most of the crowds cheered and clapped. But among them were some protesters who chanted slogans against US policy in Gaza - a reminder of the vexing problems he will face when he takes office. Then, in seconds, he was whisked inside. Although the moment was brief, its historic nature was not lost on many in the crowd. For some, it marked the beginning of a long-promised day. For others around town, it was the move that triggers a thousand other events, as loyalists of the old regime make room for coming appointees, staff workers and their families. Earlier in the day, the president-elect left Chicago for Washington, boarding an Air Force jet emblazoned with the presidential seal and frequently used to transport the vice president or first lady. When he stepped off the plane at Andrews Air Force Base an hour and a half later, he was greeted with a salute. Obama told journalists on board that he "choked up" as he left his empty Chicago house in the afternoon. One of Malia's close friends had dropped off a scrapbook full of pictures of the girls since they were in preschool. Asked whether he was looking forward to moving to Washington, Obama said: "Yeah, although living in a hotel for two weeks, we kind of did that for two years," referring to his two-year-long campaign. By Sunday night, when his black limo pulled up to the hotel about 7.30 pm, Obama's temporary home had been transformed into a secured fortress. Steel barricades lined the sidewalks. Dual layers of concrete barriers cut off all paths to the hotel. Until Friday afternoon, the hotel wouldn't even confirm that the soon-to-be first family would be guests. A hotel spokesman would only say that its suites offered "an especially good view in the wintertime of the White House." When the motorcade finally left Obama at the hotel, some in the crowd claimed that they glimpsed the president-elect, clad in a navy suit and blue tie, through the limo's windows. Others, including protesters busy demanding a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip, blinked and missed it entirely. Regardless of what they saw, many said they would be telling their children and grandchildren of the day when the man who became the country's first black president spent the first night with his family in the cit
