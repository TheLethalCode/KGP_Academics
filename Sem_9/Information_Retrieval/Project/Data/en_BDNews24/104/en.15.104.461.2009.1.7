 Dhaka, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com)  Striker Jahid Hasan Emily struck four goals to power holders Dhaka Abahani Limited to an emphatic 6-0 home win over their Khulna namesakes in the Citycell B. League at Bangabandhu National Stadium on Wednesday. Apart from Emily's fours, Nigerian striker Emeka Christian scored two goals in the one-side affairs in front of almost empty crowd at the big bowl. It was a clash between the league leaders and the bottom team on the point table and the margin also reflected the real strength of two sides. With the ninth victory in 13 matches, the sky blues outfit stretched their lead to 29, four points cushion of joint second-placed Brothers Union and Sheikh Russel KC, who however played a match less than the leaders. Khulna Abahani continued their losing streak to stay on the bottom place with just three points, also playing 13 outings. Abahani bossed throughout the game and took just 12 minutes to open their account when Emily, collecting a through pass from Emeka, shrugged off his marker to lash the ball past onrushing goalkeeper Nahiduddin to put the Dhanmondi-based outfit ahead. The young striker doubled the margin in the 31st minute after Emeka and he himself squandered two efforts inside five minutes. Picking up a through pass from Ghanaian Awudu Ibrahim, Emily advanced into the danger zone to dodge past two opponent defenders to complete his hattrick, fourth in the league after Sheikh Russel's Alfaz Ahmed, Arambagh's Nicodemus and Dhaka Mohammedan's Bukola Olaleken. After resumption, Emily struck his fourth goal in the match one minute into the second half when the national striker just pushed a minus from Ibrahim, who released the ball from the touchline. Then, Emily fed a nice cross from the left for Emeka, who blasted the cross home inside the box to make it 5-0 and sealed the match in the 54th minute striking his second goal in the match. Khulna Abahani had just one shot on the target and they should have found net, but striker Mehdi Hasan failed to beat national goalkeeper Biplob Bhattacharya in one-on-one situation in the 77th minute. bd
