 LONDON, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England striker Jermain Defoe will rejoin Tottenham Hotspur from Portsmouth after the Premier League clubs agreed a fee on Tuesday. Tottenham said on their website (www.tottenhamhotspur.com) Defoe, who spent four years at White Hart Lane before moving to Portsmouth for 7.5 million pounds ($10.98 million) a year ago, had agreed personal terms for the move, which is subject to a medical. "It's great to be back," Defoe told Sky Sports after he was presented to home fans before the 4-1 League Cup semi-final, first leg win over Burnley. "Everyone knows the manager (Harry Redknapp) was a major factor in me coming back but obviously the fans are fantastic and the reception showed that." No transfer fee was given by either club for the move but local media speculated that Spurs would be paying around 15 million pounds. Defoe's move links him for the third time with Redknapp, who took him to Portsmouth last season having been his boss at West Ham United where the 26-year-old began his professional career. Defoe, who scored 17 goals in 36 games for Portsmouth, has played 32 times for England, many of them substitute appearances, and scored six goals
