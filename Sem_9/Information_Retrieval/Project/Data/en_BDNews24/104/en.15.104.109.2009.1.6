<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain on Tuesday welcomed the new ruling alliance's proposal to choose a deputy speaker from the opposition. "The initiative to choose a deputy speaker from the opposition MPs is a good one. This practice is seen in different countries and it will be good to see it also in Bangladesh," Delwar said. Urging the ruling Awami League to implement its electoral manifesto, he commented, "A rigging-backed so-called elected government is much better than a non-elected government." "There was a broad range of rigging in the Dec 29 election but we have been forced to concede to the results through an abnormally inflated voter turnout," he alleged. The BNP secretary general said, "AL reminded us of its 'BAKSAL character' by attacking BNP leaders and workers who were forced to flee their homes right after the election." "Since Dec 29, some 11 people have been murdered, around 1,500 people injured, hundreds of shops and offices ravaged, thousands of BNP workers and supporters intimidated." Delwar said, "We'll play a responsible role in the parliament and AL must change its character alongside singing of 'changes'." Referring to an election commissioner's recent remarks about those presenting ballot papers, Delwar said, "The Commission must explain in the first place how the ballot papers went out of the polling centres." "But ironically the commissioner is threatening action against those who found the ballot papers, not those responsible behind such a serious offence." "The EC is threatening to sue the ones who found the ballot papers, but we think the EC should be sued instead," the BNP leader said. "The 90 percent turnout as shown by the EC is incredible. They (the election officials) have themselves cast the ballots in the boxes," Delwar alleged, adding that there were few people at most centres after 12 noon on election day. The BNP secretary general upheld BNP's stance on the results maintaining that they are "unacceptable". On the delay in oath-taking by the four-party MPs-elect, Delwar said, "The alliance's MPs-elect will take oath at a convenient time." He hoped the ninth parliament would not be one-sided and will allow the opposition the floor to voice their views and concerns. BNP office secretary Rizvi Ahmed, and former MPs Sohrab Uddin and Shamsuzzaman were also present at the briefing among others. bdnews
