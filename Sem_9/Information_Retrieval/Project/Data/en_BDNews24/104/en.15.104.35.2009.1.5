<TEXT>
 Abdur Rahim Harmachi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka Jan 5 (bdnews24.com)  Outgoing finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said Monday the new government must adopt good management for economic development as the caretaker government leaves all major indices on the up. "Bangladesh's economy now stands on a firm base leaving the incoming government at ease, and all major indices including foreign exchange reserves, exports, foreign aid, remittances, are positive," Aziz told bdnews24.com. On the eve of his departure after a two-year tenure manning the finance and planning ministries, he also said that inflation came down from double digits to 6.21 percent in November on a point-to-point basis. Aziz said, "The new government will have no problem in running the economy as the overall situation is very good and all that is needed now is good management." "Revenue earnings in the first half of FY2008-9 recorded 17 percent growth and tax collection jumped 38 percent," said the outgoing adviser. He advised the new government to go after income tax and VAT to keep up growth in revenue earnings. Asked what would be the biggest challenge for the nascent government, Aziz said, "Challenges are common for every government, and the new government is no exception. We too had to face challenges both inward and outward." "But we managed to overcome the hurdles, give the economy a solid base and the current falling trend in prices globally will help the next administration." Aziz also advised the incoming government to invest the money saved from falling fuel prices in the power sector. The outgoing adviser said many aspects in the new government's electoral manifesto are by and large similar to the outgoing administration's reform programmes. "These reform programmes, if implemented, will yield sound economic benefit." "The ongoing global economic crisis is yet to impact our economy  exports and foreign remittance inflow are on the rise  but a prolonged global crisis may have some impact," Aziz warned. bdnews
