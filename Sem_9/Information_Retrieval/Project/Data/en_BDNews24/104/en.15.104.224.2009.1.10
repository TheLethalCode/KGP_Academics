 Manoj Saha bdnews24.com Gopalganj correspondent Gopalganj, January 9 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina Friday said her government was committed to ensuring an equitable development across the country. "Those who voted for AL and Grand Alliance and those who didn't will get equal treatment from us," Hasina told Tungipara locals at a view-exchange meeting at Bangabandhu Mausoleum. "The AL-led grand alliance will not deprive any particular region of it due; nor will it flood an area with 'tide of development' as happened in the past," the prime minister said. "We'll work for the development of all the electoral constituencies, irrespective of their representatives' political colour or the people's cast, creed or religion," she said. Sheikh Hasina arrived in Tungipara in the morning to pay respects at the grave of the late independence hero and her father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The 4-chopper fleet of the prime minister carrying 13 of her cabinet members and Bangabandhu's family members touched down at Tungipara helipad at 11:10 am. An armed forces' contingent gave her a guard of honour on arrival. Hasina reached the Bangabandhu Mausoleum at 11:30 am, prayed and signed the visitors' book there. bdnews2
