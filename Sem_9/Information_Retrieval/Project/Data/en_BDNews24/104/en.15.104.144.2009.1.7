<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com)In an instant reaction to the swearing in of Sheikh Hasina's government on Tuesday, Awami League ally and Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad said he was "very happy for the new administration". "To become president is not the main thing, the great achievement is we came to power forging the grand alliance," said Ershad on Tuesday. "I would have had to quit Jatiya Party and also give up my Dhaka seat if I were the President. I chose not to become president," he said after the Bangabhaban ceremony. Ershad, who was keen for the presidency before the election, said he would accept the position of deputy leader of parliament if offered. Ershad avoided a direct reply to whether he was happy to see at least one JP representative, GM Qader, in the cabinet: "I hope the size of the cabinet will expand and JP will get more room than that." "The new cabinet looks smart as there is fresh blood, and also talented and honest members are on board," said the former president. bdnew
