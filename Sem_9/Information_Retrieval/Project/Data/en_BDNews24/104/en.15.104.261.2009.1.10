<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com)  The nation commemorates the anniversary on Saturday of the homecoming of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country's independence architect. On this day in 1972, prime minister Sheikh Hasina's father made a triumphal return to the young country from jail in Pakistan, where he was held during the war that brought Bangladesh into existence in Dec. 1971. 'Bangabandhu' or 'the beloved of Bengal', as the revered leader is fondly called, returned home from the Pakistani jail via London and New Delhi. The day is known as homecoming day. The Pakistan army arrested him on the night of March 25, 1971 just after his declaration of the independence of Bangladesh. President Iajuddin Ahmed and prime minister Sheikh Hasina have delivered separate messages on the occasion. Paying tribute to his memories, the president said, "The country's independence hero had returned to the country on this day after the victory in the liberation war." "After the armed struggle and an untold suffering, the people of the country were moved getting back their great leader among them," the president added. In her message, Hasina called on the people to establish Golden Bangladesh, which Bangabandhu dreamt of. "The people of the country dream of a democratic, welfare and modern Bangladesh," she said. The ninth parliamentary election has reflected that dream, she added. PROGRAMMES Awami League and its front organisations have taken up elaborate programme to observe the day. The AL will hoist national and party flags atop party headquarters, Bangabandhu Bhaban and party offices across the country. Wreaths will be placed at the portrait of Sheikh Mujib in the morning. The party has also arranged a discussion programme at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre at 3pm. Hasina, also president of the AL, will be present at the discussion, her press secretary Abul Kalam Azad said. A representative team will go to Tungipara in Gopalganj, where the graves of Sheikh Muijib and his immediate family members are, to pay tribute. The local government minister and the party's spokesperson, Syed Ashraful Islam, in a statement urged all the party units to hold prayers and discussion on the occasion. bdnew
