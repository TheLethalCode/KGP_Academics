<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has told top civil servants they can expect no hurdles if they work fearlessly and neutrally to free the country of poverty by 2021. "I assure you that you will be able to work without facing any impediments," the prime minister told secretaries to all ministries and divisions at the Secretariat on Sunday. "You must be careful that there is no partisanship when you do your job," she said. The head of the government asked the officials to work neutrally with all their talents and efforts, in her first secretary-level meeting since she took over for her second term as prime minister. "We, who have come here by election, are temporary, but you, the staffers of the republic, are permanent. You will have to pursue your duties in line with the law. You have to ensure public service," Hasina told the meeting that started shortly before 1pm. "You have to work complying with rules and regulations to fulfil the pledges we made to the people. You have to ensure good governance," the prime minister said. If the law itself was a hurdle to discharging works for public welfare, legislation would be amended, she said. "I do not want to hear that you cannot implement public welfare projects for legal obstacles. I want you all to finish works according to rule without any files left." Hasina said she was not happy about the rate of implementation of Annual Development Programme, which stood at just 18 percent in the first six months of the fiscal year. "The rate should be higher. With such a slow ADP implementation rate the country will not proceed," she said. She added her government wanted to take the rate of ADP implementation to 90-95 percent. She directed the secretaries to send a list to her office regarding the projects to be implemented and projects they would not be able to implement in the next six months. The meeting of Executive Committee of the National Economic Council would be held on Tuesdays, the prime minister said. "The meetings will review budget." She said the country did not see the desired progress in the last 38 years after independence, the rate of literacy did not rise and the rate of poverty did not decline sufficiently. Hasina blamed the frequent disruption of democracy for the . She said people cast their vote freely in the election and got opportunity to express their view. She thanked all staffers in field administration for helping hold a proper election. "I hope such good work will continue in the future," the prime minister said. bdnews
