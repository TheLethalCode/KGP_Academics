 SYDNEY, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com) - Australia dismissed South Africa for 272 with only 10 balls remaining to win an entertaining third and final Test and avoid a series whitewash. Graeme Smith, returning to the crease with a broken finger, fell to Mitchell Johnson to hand the hosts victory. The tourists started the day needing 314 to pull off an unlikely result but lost Neil McKenzie, Jacques Kallis and Hashim Amla in the opening session. Peter Siddle was man of the match with Smith named man of the series. Australia's victory meant that they retained their position at the top of the ICC's official Test rankings. The South Africans had already clinched the three-match series after winning the first two Tests in Perth and Melbourne and began the fifth day on 62 having lost Morne Morkel on Tuesday. The first session did not go as planned for the tourists with McKenzie falling with the total only moving forward by six runs. Kallis then fell for just four and Hashim Amla went for 59. AB de Villiers showed some resistance with a solid 56 but was eventually bowled by Siddle, leaving his side on a precarious 193-7 at the tea interval. Makhaya Ntini held out for over 17 overs, adding a fabulous 50 runs for the ninth wicket, before Dale Steyn was removed lbw by Andrew McDonald for 28. This set up a dramatic finale as South Africa tried to cling on for the draw with Smith, not having played since retiring hurt with a broken finger and troublesome left elbow in the first innings, deciding to bat. Smith entered the arena with 7.2 overs left to a standing ovation from the SCG crowd and survived for 17 balls before falling for three to Mitchell. Man of the match paceman Siddle ended with match figures of eight for 113. Courtesy : BB
