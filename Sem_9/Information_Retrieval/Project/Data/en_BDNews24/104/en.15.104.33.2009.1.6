 Sumon K Chakrabarti New Delhi, Jan 5 (bdnews24.com)  Police in Kolkata on Tuesday arrested two more Bangladeshis convicted for links to the murder of former Awami League lawmaker Ahsanullah Master. Javed Shamim, deputy commissioner of police (Detective Department), said the Special Task Force of Kolkata Police picked up Mujibur Rahman alias Ayub Mondal and his brother Masihur Rahman alias Russell. Fake Indian currency of 20,000 rupee and genuine Indian currency worth 2.25 lakh rupee have also been recovered from them. They have been charged with possessing fake currency since there are no records of criminal activities against the two in India. Police say both are younger brothers of Mamun Mian alias "Kala" Mamun who was arrested last year from Agartala, the capital of Tripura. Mamun allegedly used to run a fake currency racket and was involved in extortion. He also reportedly had links with a minister of Tripura's Left Front government  Shahid Choudhury  who was forced to resign from the government after the alleged ties came to light. West Bengal CID on Monday arrested three other convicts in the Ahsanullah Master murder case. Master was murdered at Tongi in Bangladesh on May 7, 2004. One of the three arrested on Monday, Nurul Islam Dipu, has been awarded capital punishment for the killing, and the other two received life terms. bd
