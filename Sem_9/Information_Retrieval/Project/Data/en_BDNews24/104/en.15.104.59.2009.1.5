<TITLE> Rift with Moores not healthy, says Pietersen </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Jan 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The rift between England captain Kevin Pietersen and head coach Peter Moores is "unhealthy" and must be resolved as soon as possible, Pietersen was quoted as saying on Sunday. Pietersen told the News of the World that he wanted the issue sorted out before England arrive in the West Indies for a four-test tour later this month. The pair's fractious relationship since Pietersen took over the captaincy in August has come to a head in recent days and a poor series of results since Moores became coach nearly two years ago have not helped the situation. Pietersen, who has held talks with England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) managing director Hugh Morris, said: "This situation is not healthy, we have to make sure it is settled as soon as possible and certainly before we fly off to the West Indies. "Everything has to be hunky dory, everybody has to have the same aims and pull in the same direction for the good of the England team." On Saturday Moores refused to comment on the row, telling The Sun: "I hope you understand that I can't really comment at this stage. I think I will take a rain-check on that." He also said "no comment" when asked if he could work with Pietersen in the future. Former England captain David Gower said he believed that Pietersen will win the power struggle, telling BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek: "It's a bit of a mess but I've got a feeling Kevin Pietersen will get his way. "When Pietersen was appointed captain he asked Moores to stay in the background and organise nets while he got on the with the job of organising the team. "If there is a character clash in terms of personalities, Pietersen is the bigger one and it's not the sort of situation where compromise is going to work. "You can't have factions and you can't have divisions. Morris has an interesting task on his hands to mediate if he can. If he can't he doesn't have much time to work out who is going to coach England in the Ashes." Pietersen was praised recently for leading England back to India for a two-match series following the Mumbai attacks
