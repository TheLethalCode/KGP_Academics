 Dhaka, Jan 6 (bdnews24.com)  The BNP-led four-party alliance hopes the new AL-led government will "remain alert against any return to unconstitutional government", said a senior party leader on Tuesday. "The new government with a new form must work in the interests of people and the country upholding their own ideology," Salauddin Quader Chowdhury, parliamentary affairs secretary to Khaleda Zia, told bdnews24.com in a reaction shortly after the new government headed by prime minister Sheikh Hasina was sworn in. Five BNP lawmakers-elect, led by senior party leader Salahuddin Quader, attended the swearing in ceremony of the new Awami League-led government Tuesday evening at Bangabhaban. Taking an apparent dig at Hasina's pledges to people in the run-up to the election, he said: "People expect they will get rice at Tk 10 per kg, fertiliser free of cost and employment for one member in every family from the new government." But he wished the new cabinet success. On new faces among the ministers, he said, "The cabinet will get new ideas and plans from them." Denying allegations of war crimes, he said, "I am not a war criminal. I would help the new government if they started trying war criminals." The newly elected lawmakers of the opposition BNP-led alliance have yet to accept their seats as MPs, as they skipped their scheduled oath-taking on Jan 4. But it was decided "in consultation with the chairperson on Monday night" that a team of BNP representatives would attend the swearing in of Hasina's new administration at Bangabhaban, Salahuddin Quader told bdnews24.com earlier in the day. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain speaking to reporters on Tuesday evening welcomed the AL-led government's decision to appoint a deputy speaker from the opposition. bdnews
