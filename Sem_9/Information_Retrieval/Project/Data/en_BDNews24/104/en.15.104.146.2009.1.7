 LONDON, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester City's new owner Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al Nahyan is the richest man in British football with Chelsea's Roman Abramovich down to third place in FourFourTwo magazine's annual Rich List published on Wednesday. The 38-year-old Sheikh, who is from Abu Dhabi and took over at City in September, is estimated to be worth 15 billion pounds ($21.86 billion). That is more than twice as much as Russian Abramovich, 42, who slips from first to third spot on seven billion pounds.

The Italian is worth 25 million pounds and is joint 73rd on the list, with a six million pounds a year contract and a 10 million pounds private art collection.
