 DUBAI, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - David Beckham made his AC Milan debut with a steady first-half run-out against Hamburg SV in a friendly on Tuesday won 4-3 on penalties by the Italians after the match finished 1-1. Beckham, 33, has joined the Serie A club on a short loan spell from Los Angeles Galaxy to keep up his fitness and stay in contention for the England team during the U.S. close season. The former Manchester United and Real Madrid midfielder was soon involved, sending a long ball into the Hamburg penalty area and seeking out Andriy Shevchenko. He later set up Alexandre Pato to shoot straight at the Hamburg keeper before being substituted at halftime. Ronaldinho broke the deadlock for Milan, scoring from the penalty spot in the 61st minute, but Hamburg were quick to equalise with a close-range effort from Collin Benjamin in the 66th minute. "I'm still part of the national team now," Beckham told reporters. "When I'm playing and when I'm fit the manager has always said there's a chance he'll pick me." "I've never played in the Italian league before so it's going to be exciting for me." "To me he gave a very good impression," said Milan's coach Carlo Ancelotti. "Dynamic quality and also he is an intelligent player." "Obviously he is not at his maximum because for two months he didn't do anything but he had a good week with us and now he is in a good condition and can make a good contribution to the team.
