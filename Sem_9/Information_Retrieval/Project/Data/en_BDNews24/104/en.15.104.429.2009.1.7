 Dhaka, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com)  Opposition BNP MPs-elect will take oath and join parliament when it convenes, a meeting chaired by party chief Khaleda Zia decided on Wednesday night. Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury said after the two-hour meeting that ended at 9:52pm they were seeking the right scope and environment from the treasury bench to play the role expected of them in parliament. He said they will decide on the date in consultation with the speaker. Chowdhury referred to prime minister Sheikh Hasina's recent 'generous' remarks and said, "We want to play a constructive role in the parliament and hope that Sheikh Hasina's words and actions will be on the same track." "We'll do our best to help the Awami League-led government to implement its pledges to provide rice at Tk 10 a kg, free fertiliser and employment to one youth per family." "We'll consider a possible treasury bench proposal to choose a deputy speaker from the opposition." About the deputy leader of the opposition in House, he said BNP has not yet formed a parliamentary party and the issue will be decided after taking oath. BNP will make relentless efforts as an opposition to ensure accountability of the treasury, SQ Chowdhury said. "The meeting began at the chairperson's Gulshan office around 7.40pm, with 26 of 27 of the party's elected MPs present," said Maruf Kamal Khan Sohel, Khaleda's media cell chief.
