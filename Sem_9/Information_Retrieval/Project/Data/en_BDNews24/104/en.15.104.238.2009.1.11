 Dhaka, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com)  Three factions of pro-Awami League Bangladesh Chhatra League clashed over control of a hall at Dhaka College late on Saturday, a day after the home minister warned against campus violence. Officer in charge of New Market Police Station, Anisur Rahman, told bdnews24.com at 12:15am on Sunday the fight left 15 injured. Many general students left the hall amid the fight, which took place less than 48 hours into the clashes at Ziaur Rahman Hall of Dhaka University between two BCL camps on Thursday night. Senior police officials of Ramna Zone brought the situation under control with the help of teachers and the fight that had started at 10pm ended at 1am. On Friday, Sahara Khatun, the home minister, warned that "nobody will be spared" if involved in campus violence. Rahman said students of 'North' and 'South' halls hurled stones at each other after a hand-to-hand fight. Some general students were also wounded in the incident. At round 8pm, activists loyal to 'Titu' scuffled with followers of 'Tareq' over the allotment of room 207 of 'North Hostel'. The supporters of 'Tareq' stormed and took control of 'South Hostel' around 10pm, prompting the other two groups to fight that group for control. Some homemade bombs were exploded during the clash. The general secretary of BCL's Dhaka College unit, Tutul, who gave only one name, said Some activists of the metropolitan Chhatra League and others who recently joined Chhatra League from other parties had made the campus restive. "Though we called police in the evening, they came after 10pm. The incident could have been averted had they arrived on time" he said, an allegation the police officer denied. Heavy police presence was there on the campus. bd
