 NEW DELHI, Fri Jan 9, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Indian government called in troops to load fuel tankers and some striking employees at state oil firms went back to work on Friday, easing fears of a prolonged fuel crisis. The government dug in its heels on the third day of a stoppage that has triggered panic buying and cut natural gas and crude oil output in the energy-hungry nation, saying no further talks were possible and threatening to imprison striking workers. Company officials, who had walked out demanding better pay, returned to work at Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd, and with Hindustan Petroleum Corp not on strike, nearly half of India's 35,000 petrol stations were likely to be operating soon. Ministers turned the heat on union leaders after long queues at the few petrol pumps with supplies jammed rush-hour traffic in major cities, and officials feared that power plants may have to shut and cooking gas shortages could trigger anger. "Army officials are reaching a terminal near Delhi this evening to help loading and we are expecting them at some other locations also," Indian Oil Corp Chairman Sarthak Behuria told reporters. The government says the strike is illegal and has invoked laws that forbid the obstruction of essential commodities. "They cannot hold the country to ransom," Petroleum Secretary R.S. Pandey told reporters. "We are seeking the army's help to restart (IOC's) Mathura refinery." Deora said the unit should be running again within 12 hours and that he expects fuel supplies to normalise by Saturday morning, while Pandey said over 60 percent of retail outlets in major cities were now open. CRISIS AVERTED? BPCL's director for marketing, S. Radhakrishnan, said 70 percent of his company's employees had already resumed work, while sources at explorer Oil India Ltd said workers at that company were also abandoning union leaders. Earlier, four-fifths of petrol stations in large cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore and Kolkata had run out of stocks and supplies to airlines had also suffered, industry officials said. Dozens of flight were delayed. Officials at IOC, which runs about 18,000 of India's petrol pumps, and other state-run firms such as Oil and Natural Gas Corp began the strike on Wednesday. The few petrol stations that had stocks struggled to meet the heavy rush of motorists. "I had to work till 3:00 a.m. because there was a long queue of vehicles trying to tank up," said Dhruva Gharai, the owner of a gas station in Kolkata. Some petrol stations reported their highest-ever daily sales as motorists filled up in panic. "It will take at least a week for things to normalise," Gharai said. Behuria said IOC was asking retired employees and the territorial army to help the state-run refiner resume normal supplies. A separate truckers' strike that began on Monday added to the government's headaches. "We are trying to make sure that at least aviation fuel is not hampered. But if it continues, it will have an impact even on airlines," IOC's Srikumar said. Srikumar said IOC was maintaining supplies to its top priorities, the railways, defence forces and airlines, but senior managers were struggling to ensure smooth operations. Union leaders and company officials held talks for two hours late Thursday night, but could not reach an agreement. "They are causing immense hardship to the country and its citizens," Pandey said. "They have defied court orders. They have repeatedly defied appeals of the government." The government has said in the past that it may consider buying fuel from private firms Reliance Industries that runs an export-focused refinery and Essar Oil
