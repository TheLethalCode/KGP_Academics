 Dhaka, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com)  Experts say the government should form farmers' organisations to break up business syndicates and cut prices of commodities. "I don't think the government can do this by political means, other than by forming farmers' organisations related to producing and marketing commodities," said TIB trustee board chairman professor Mozaffar Ahmad. Mozaffar made the remarks at a discussion at National Press Club on the government pledges and duties on bringing down the runaway prices of commodities. Commerce minister Faruque Khan on Thursday termed 'business syndicates' one of the main causes for high prices of commodities in the country. He had said tough measures would be taken against business syndicates. The TIB trustee board chairman felt the need for introduction of a competitive market to bring down the exorbitant prices. "Unscrupulous businesses forming syndicates run their activities in the country and so prices of commodities skyrocket," he said, blaming monopoly for price hike. "Only people having more capital are controlling the people with less capital," he observed. Dr Atiur Rahman, a professor at the Department of Development Studies at the University of Dhaka, also spoke suggested the government gave subsidies on fertiliser for cutting expenditure on farming cost. He floated the idea of 'forming a citizens' committee' to monitor irrigation facilities and proper supply of fertiliser among farmers. Former caretaker government adviser Dhiraj Kumar Nath and Prof. Sadrul Amin, a professor of Hajee Mohammad Danesh Science and Technology University, were present, among others at the discussion. Bangabandhu Diploma Krishibid Parisad hosted the discussion meeting. b
