<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina said on Saturday her government needs to deliver on its election pledges and asked all to build the country together. "We must realise the dreams and hopes we talked about in our electoral manifesto and carry out at all costs the responsibilities the people have vested in our government," Hasina said at a meeting to mark the 37th homecoming anniversary of independence architect Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Awami League organised the gathering at the China-Bangladesh Conference, where Hasina made a clarion call to all to be united in nation building. "Let's join hands in building the country. We trust in harmonious development," the AL chief told party supporters. Terming their election victory a reflection of people's confidence and trust, she said, "We have to translate people's aspirations into reality and value their confidence and trust." The prime minister asked the party leaders and workers to move forward with patience and dedication. "Don't ask how much you've received, but do ask how much you've been able to give. We must forget differences and join hands to ensure the goals set by the people." Referring to ongoing campus violence Hasina said, "There's a group which is known as 'all-weather government supporters' and we must be careful about them." "The Chhatra League and Jubo League are strong enough and don't need to induct more members. Some trouble makers will try to sneak in and mess up earning the organisations bad names," she warned. "Our party doesn't believe in politics of occupation and revenge," the AL president asserted. Prior to the prime minister's speech, AL presidium members Amir Hossain Amu, Tofayel Ahmed and Abdur Razzaque, who failed to gain entry to Hasina's cabinet, promised the government all-out support. Amu said, "People's dreams won't be realised and the government won't succeed if we don't extend all-out support. I believe the government will be successful with our support." Abdur Razzaque urged, "All-level workers of the party must help the government whole-heartedly." "All of us, members of parliament, must help her (Hasina's) dreams come true," said Tofayel Ahmed. Reacting to BNP leader MK Anwar's recent comments that approval of the caretaker government's ordinances without consultation with BNP would make parliament ineffective, AL presidium member Suranjit Sen Gupta said Anwar should read the Constitution before making such a comment. "We wanted to elect Speaker and Deputy Speaker together with BNP, but they made it impossible," said Suranjit referring to the opposition MPs' refusal so far to take oaths. Suranjit too did not find a cabinet post. Workers Party president Rashed Khan Menon and AL presidium member Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim also spoke, both demanding trial of the war criminals. Sheikh Hasina chaired the discussion while agriculture minister and AL presidium member Motia Chowdhury and the prime minister's adviser Syed Modasser Ali, AL joint secretary Mukul Bose, organising secretary Saber Hossain Chowdhury and others attended. bdnews
