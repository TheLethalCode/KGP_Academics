<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 5 (bdnews24.com)  Home adviser MA Matin has advised the new government to form a high powered committee along the lines of the National Coordination Committee to make the drive against corruption successful. "A committee like this will help in the prevention of corruption and can assist the Anticorruption Commission." If the government gets any complaints about corruption, then it can carry on an investigation through such a committee and take necessary steps, added the adviser. He made the comments after a farewell meeting with officials of the ministry of shipping. Evaluating the work of the past two years, MA Matin said, "We have worked as a team and through teamwork a lot of success can be achieved." In this context, he mentioned overcoming the devastation left by Cyclone Sidr and the solving of problems affecting Chittagong Port. "Hopefully, the next government will carry on the anti corruption drive started by this government," commented the adviser. Talking about tasks that could not be completed, he said, "We took an initiative to put the Chittagong New Mooring Terminal under private ownership. But due to lack of time and other complications it could not be realised." When asked about the unprecedented two-year tenure of this government, the adviser observed, "This time was needed to prepare for a good election; many expressed fears but dispelling those we managed to hold a free and fair election." "We came to power to work and when we saw complications impeding our work, we tried to resolve them with new legislation," added Matin. "The next government will consider these new laws as part of constitutional progression," he said. bdnews24
