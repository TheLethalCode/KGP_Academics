 Dhaka, January 9 (bdnews24.com)Home minister Sahara Kahtun warned Friday that "nobody will be spared" from action against campus violence, after two factions of Bangladesh Chhatra League were involved in overnight clashes at Dhaka University. The clashes left four injured at DU's Zia Hall, while Shahbagh police arrested seven individuals from the spot. Asked to comment on the clashes, home minister advocate Sahara Khatun told bdnews24.com Friday, "Nobody will be spared. I've already instructed the authorities to take action. Stricter measures will be taken, if necessary." Professor Borhanuddin Khan, provost of Zia Hall, told reporters after the incident that he was unwilling to continue as the hall's guardian any more. Among the injured, Shohagh, a fourth year sociology student suffered a severed artery in the hand and was admitted to the National Institute of Orthopaedics and Traumatology. Sumon, another fourth year sociology student was taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital, two more students Himel of first year finance and Chunnu were also admitted to medical centres. Among the arrested students were Khokon of fourth year Sanskrit, Selim Reza reading for a masters in sociology, Zakaria Rahman Ziko of English fourth year, Shafiullah Shihan of first year psychology, Touhidul Islam from first year political science, Rashidul Islam of fourth year philosophy and Ruhul Karim from second year history. Activists of the hall kept up their agitations from 12 midnight till 4.30 am, reportedly sparked by the ousting of a Chhatradal activist from the dorms. Cohorts of DU Chhatro League president Sheikh Sohel Rana Tipu led the violence by swooping on supporters of DU Chhatro League general secretary Sajjad Sakib Badsha's, inflicting injuries with knives, sticks and pieces of iron rod and vandalising ten rooms including the hall provost's chamber. Hall residents and other BCL activists alleged that Kamal and Salman who were also leading the attack were known to be BCL rival Chhatra Dal activists in the recent past, who happen to be enjoying Tipu's patronage now. Police arriving at the hall charged with batons on the students to disperse them. Dean of social sciences, professor Harunur Rashid also came to the hall to pacify the angry students, who declined to continue in his office. bdnews24.c
