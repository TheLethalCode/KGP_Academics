 Dhaka, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com)--Minister AK Khandker says he will develop his planning ministry as the think-tank of the government. "The planning ministry should always act as the think-tank of the government," he told reporters on his first day at work Wednesday. The new planning minister said the size of the annual development programme (ADP) should be kept within the reach of the country's economy. "However, there can be exceptions in some cases," he told newsmen at the planning ministry on his first day in office. The ex-air force chief was greeted by his civil servants led by planning secretary Jafar Ahmed Chowdhury upon his arrival around 10.30am. Khandaker held a meeting with secretaries, members of the planning commission and planning division officials. "We are aiming to implement projects through strict monitoring so that the quality of the projects can improve and the money is spent meaningfully." He said the country would be on track to development if promises stated in Awami League's manifesto are implemented. He thanked voters, especially "the 52 percent young voters" for rejecting war criminals in the election. "Most of the war criminals failed to get elected. It is the successful outcome of the Sector Commanders' Forum's (SCF) work and I thank each and every member of it," said the Liberation War hero, who was second-in-command to Gen Osmany. He hoped that the trial of war criminals would start soon. "It is very important for the nation." bdn
