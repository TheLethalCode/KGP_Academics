 LONDON, Wed Jan 7,(bdnews24.com/Reuters Life!) - Americans wanting meet their new president Barack Obama on January 20, when he takes office, can make their way to the Madame Tussauds waxwork museum in London, where they will be allowed to see his lookalike for free. A besuited, smiling Obama is expected to be unveiled next week, when his wax figure will appear standing with arms crossed in a recreation of the Oval office at the White House, a spokeswoman said on Wednesday. "On inauguration day, as it's a historic day we thought it fitting that Americans could come and meet the president for free," the spokeswoman added. "They just need to bring their passport or some form of photo ID." The cheapest entrance fee is usually 12.50 pounds ($19)
