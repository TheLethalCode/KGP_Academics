 Dhaka, Jan 9 (bdnews24.com) - The Sector Commanders Forum on Friday called on the government led by Awami league to take initiatives for holding war crimes trials in the very first sitting of parliament. SCF leaders, who campaigned aggressively for the trial of war criminals ahead of the Dec 29 election, said the people of the country had voted the grand alliance to power so that it would hold the trials. "The Sector Commanders Forum will not stop campaigning until the war criminals are tried," said SCF vice-president Maj Gen (retd) KM Safiullah. Safiullah said the trial of war criminals is now a demand of the entire country. "We request the lawmakers to take a stand in favour of the trial of war criminals." The sector commanders, of Bangladesh's 1971 war of independence, were addressing a thanks giving ceremony to the people of the country for voting pro-liberation forces to power, at the Liberation War Museum in the city. "But voting is not the end of the people's responsibility. All must remain aware on the issue of war criminals and the enemies of the country," said sector commander Mir Shawkat Ali. "It seems we got freedom back again. But measures will have to be taken for holding the trial of war criminals in the very first session of the parliament," he said. Presided over by SCF vice-president Safiullah, the programme was addressed, among others, by sector commanders Lt Gen (retd) Mir Shawkat Ali, Lt Gen (retd) Harun-or-Rashid and Col (retd) Abu Osman Chowdhury. Abu Osman Chowdhury also expressed his hope that initiatives will be taken for holding the trial of war criminals in the first session of the ninth parliament scheduled for starting on Jan. 25. Harun-or-Rashid stressed that prime minister Sheikh Hasina had promised in her election manifesto that her party would try the war criminals if it came to power. "Now, we hope that she will meet the promise." Harun suggested the Collaborators Act 1974 could be revived or the parliament could introduce new laws for the trial of war crmnals. Said Shawkat Ali: "If Milosevic could be tried after so many years for ordering mass killing, then why can't these war criminals be tried, as they also committed the same crime,". bdnews
