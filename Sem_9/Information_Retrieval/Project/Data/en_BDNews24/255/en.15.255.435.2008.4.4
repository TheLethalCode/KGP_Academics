<TITLE> Diana jury retires for weekend, no decision </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, April 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The jury at the inquest into Princess Diana's death retired for the weekend on Friday after failing to reach a decision in three days of deliberations. Diana and her lover Dodi al-Fayed died in August 1997 when their Mercedes limousine, driven by chauffeur Henri Paul, crashed in a Paris road tunnel while being pursued by paparazzi photographers. The 11-member jury, who will return to court on Monday, have a choice of five possible verdicts. They could decide her death was accidental or opt for unlawful killing through gross negligence either by Henri Paul, by "following vehicles" or by both. The fifth option, which could give renewed life to the conspiracy theories that have surrounded Diana's death for the past decade, is an open verdict if the jury find there is insufficient evidence to support any substantive verdict.
