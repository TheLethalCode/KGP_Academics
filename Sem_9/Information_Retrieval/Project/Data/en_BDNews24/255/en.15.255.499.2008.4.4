<TEXT>
 London, April 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's leading shares climbed 0.2 percent early on Friday ahead of US jobs data, as British Energy topped the leaderboard on a report of a possible bid from France's EDF. At 0750 GMT, the FTSE 100 edged 12.7 points higher to 5,904.0. U.S. non-farm payrolls numbers for March are due at 1230 GMT, and investors hope for clues on the health of the world's largest economy and the outlook for interest rates. Economists in a Reuters survey forecast a loss of 60,000 jobs in the United States in March, compared with a loss of 63,000 in February.

Rival Astrazeneca gained 2.6 percent after Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the drugmaker to 2,200 pence from 2,150 pence and kept its "equal-weight" rating. On the downside, retailer Marks & Spencer was 1.2 percent lower after the Daily Mail said M&S had written to all of its shareholders in an attempt to quell the storm over the appointment of Stuart Rose as executive chairman. Banks also weighed, as persistent credit worries and profit-taking dogged the sector. HBOS fell 2.4 percent, Lloyds TSB shed 1.7 percent and HSBC lost 0.8 pe
