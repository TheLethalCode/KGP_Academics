<TITLE> France seeks peaceful end to yacht hijacking: PM </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PARIS, April 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The French navy is tracking a luxury yacht seized by pirates off the Somali coast but wants to avoid any use of force to free the 30 crew, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon said on Saturday. "We are following this hostage-taking minute by minute. We have dispatched the military means to enable us to monitor the boat from a distance," Fillon told reporters. "All channels of discussion are open to try to resolve this issue without using force," he said, adding. "We are putting the emphasis on protecting the life of those on board." Pirates stormed the three-masted yacht, the Ponant, on Friday in the Gulf of Aden and took the crew hostage. There were no passengers aboard at the time. French Defence Minister Herve Morin said 22 of the crew were French nationals, including six women. Among the rest were Ukrainians and Koreans, he said. "We have had no contact with the pirates at the moment and do not know what their intention is," Morin told reporters. "We are continuing to follow them." The Defence Ministry said it sent a small warship, the Commandant Bouan, to shadow the boat, which was seized in open seas and has since been taken to Somali waters. Morin said Somalia had agreed to let the French navy enter its waters and added that additional frigates were being sent to the scene. The Ponant is owned by the Compagnie des Iles du Ponant and was heading from the Seychelles to the Mediterranean Sea when it was hijacked. The International Maritime Bureau lists Somalia and Nigeria as having the world's most dangerous waters. The piracy watchdog's most recent report, released in January, said Somalia saw the highest number of hostages taken. Kidnapping and piracy are lucrative businesses in lawless Somalia, and most Somalis treat their captives well in anticipation of a good ransom. France has 2,900 troops stationed in Djibouti, which borders Somalia and lies on the coast. It also has a naval force in the Indian Ocean which is part of the Enduring Freedom mission for Afghanistan.
