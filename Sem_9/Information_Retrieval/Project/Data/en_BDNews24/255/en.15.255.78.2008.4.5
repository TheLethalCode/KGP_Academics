 Dhaka, April 5 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh coach Jamie Siddons is much interested in seeing more commitment and improvement from the players rather than results during the Tigers' tour of Pakistan this month. "I don't want to predict whether Bangladesh win or lose, but our main object is to show more commitment and improvement with showing better performance in Pakistan," said the Australian coach during a press conference at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium Saturday. The Tigers, invited by The Pakistan Cricket Board after Australia pulled out of their scheduled tour citing security concerns, leave here for Pakistan early Sunday to play five one-day internationals and a Twenty20 match. The series will get underway on April 6 through the first one-dayer. All matches will be played under floodlights in four Pakistani cities. The 43-year old coach, however, wants to use Bangladesh's experience in the recent performance against Ireland on the Pakistan tour. "The boys didn't play to their potential against South Africa, but they did well against Ireland, and to show better performance against a strong team like Pakistan, the team must be disciplined and follow the team rules," said the Aussie. He also emphasised sticking to the wicket to wait for a bad ball as well as pitch the ball on the right spot. Siddons reiterated that cricket was a simple game with pitching the ball on the right spot and choosing the right ball to hit. "We have worked hard about leaving the ball on the off stump and hitting the right spot with the ball, that's the simple way of improvement," said Siddons. The coach, however, expressed disappointment over his prime batsmen being off-form in domestic cricket. "It is disappointing to see the batsmen not scoring runs even in the domestic cricket. However, they are playing a lot of cricket and have a lack of rest, but it should not be an excuse," said Siddons. Bangladesh skipper Mohammad Ashraful, however, believed that they were well prepared with playing five domestic cricket matches just after the three-match series against Ireland. "Despite the absence of some players, Pakistan are still a strong side, and they had recently won 5-0 against Zimbabwe, but we can hope to win one or two matches against them if we play our potential," said Ashraful. About him, Ashraful said, "I will certainly want to get back in runs and lead the team from the front." Despite the absence of pacers Shoaib Akhter and Mohammad Asif, both the coach and the skipper believed Pakistan possess a good bowling attack. "I am not focussing, who is absent or present, what I look to is showing good attitude, playing controlled shots and putting some good runs on the board to mount pressure on the opponents," said Siddons adding the other Pakistani bowlers could swing the ball well. "Shoaib (Akhter) is out of the team for a long time, but the other bowlers have the ability to fill his place," said Ashraful.
