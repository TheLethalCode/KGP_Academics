 WASHINGTON, April 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, one of a handful of high-profile Democrats who has remained neutral in his party's presidential primary battle, has hinted that he supports Barack Obama over Hillary Clinton, according to news reports on Friday. Traveling in Nigeria, Carter said his home state of Georgia and his hometown of Plains backed Obama in the state's Feb. 5 primary. His children, their spouses and his grandchildren support Obama as well, he said. "As a superdelegate, I would not disclose who I am rooting for but I leave it to you to make that guess," ABC News quoted Carter as saying. Democratic party rules allow elected officials and party insiders, termed "superdelegates," to back whom they want at the party's nominating convention. Those who remain unaligned are being urgently courted by both campaigns, as they could mean the difference between victory and defeat in the hard-fought battle to win the party's nomination and take on presumptive Republican nominee John McCain in the November election. Neither Obama, an Illinois senator who would be the first black president, nor Clinton, a New York senator who would be the first woman president, is likely to clinch the nomination through the state-by-state primaries and caucuses that continue through June. Other prominent superdelegates who remain uncommitted include U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former Vice President Al Gore, the 2000 Democratic presidential nominee.
