<TITLE> Poor Barca display gives Schalke hope </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BERLIN, March 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Schalke 04 have reached the Champions League quarter-finals by the skin of their teeth but after Barcelona's 'shameful' weekend defeat they will feel anything is possible when they host the Catalans on Tuesday. The Arena AufSchalke is an intimidating place to play at the best of times, so how Barca will react in Gelsenkirchen after their performance against Real Betis on Saturday, when they led 2-0 but ended up losing 3-2, is anyone's guess. Schalke, UEFA Cup winners in 1997 and appearing in the quarter-finals of the European Cup for the first time since 1958-59, are third in the Bundesliga after three wins and a draw in their last four games. Barcelona, twice European champions, are also in third place in their league, yet scarcely will they have had such self-doubt before a first leg against second-tier opposition like Schalke. "It is difficult to explain what happened," said coach Frank Rijkaard after his team shipped three goals in 15 second-half minutes. "All I can do is apologise to our fans. As a coach I feel ashamed at this result." Rijkaard's room for manoeuvre is limited given that Ronaldinho is unlikely to take part because of leg muscle pain, while Deco, Rafael Marquez and Lionel Messi are all out injured. Rijkaard may be tempted to recall Silvinho on the left side of defence after yet another shoddy display at the back, while Argentine centre-back Gabriel Milito could return after missing out on the Betis defeat because of groin pain. Good defence will be important for Barcelona, who beat Celtic in the last 16, because Schalke know their best chance of an upset will be to attack with everything they've got. MEAGRE RETURN During the group phase they played defensively at home to Valencia and Chelsea and got just a point from the two matches. They squeaked through with just eight points from their six games and they responded by playing much more adventurously in the opening leg of their tie with Porto, winning it 1-0 and coming through on penalties after losing 1-0 in Portugal. The Schalke forwards were frustrated in a goalless draw away to Karlsruhe on Saturday but the team did create nine clear chances and that has pointed the way for Tuesday. "We have to get forward faster, to open up more opportunities," striker Kevin Kuranyi told reporters. "We need to create more chances." Coach Mirko Slomka experimented on Saturday by playing full-back Christian Pander in an unfamiliar position on the left of midfield, with the in-form Heiko Westermann behind him. "They worked well together," said Slomka, who will have to decide whether to play the same risky formation on Tuesday. Possible teams: Schalke 04: 1-Manuel Neuer; 18-Rafinha, 5-Marcelo Bordon, 20-Mladen Krstajic, 2-Heiko Westermann; 14-Gerald Asamoah, 13-Jermaine Jones, 8-Fabian Ernst, 24-Christian Pander; 22-Kevin Kuranyi, 19-Halil Altintop. Barcelona: 1-Victor Valdes; 11-Gianluca Zambrotta, 5-Carles Puyol, 3-Gabriel Milito, 16-Silvinho; 24-Yaya Toure, 6-Xavi, 8-Andres Iniesta; 27-Bojan Krkic, 9-Samuel Eto'o, 14-Thierry Henry or 7-Eidur Gudjohnsen
