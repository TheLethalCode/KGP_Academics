It pointed to the tens of thousands of deaths and maimings caused by chemical weapons deployed by Iraq against Iranian forces and Iraqi Kurds during the 1980s. The watchdog also singled out North Korea which has opted out of the pact. Several of these countries, including at least one from the Middle East, may sign up in the near future, Pfirter said. Russia has destroyed nearly a quarter of its stockpile and the United States close to 50 percent under the pact. The two countries have a 2012 deadline to destroy the rest of their stockpiles.
