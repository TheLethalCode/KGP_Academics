 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, April 4 (bdnews24.com)Field-level corruption has not come down despite an intense anti-graft crackdown by the caretaker government, said the chief of Transparency International, Bangladesh (TIB) Friday. "Bribery is on the rise," Prof Mozaffer Ahmad, chairman of the TIB trustee board, told bdnews24.com. He based his observation on TIB's corruption database for the year 2007, which is likely to come out by the end of April. The database was prepared on the basis of newspaper reports, which the TIB said had been verified on a random basis. Prof Ahmad pointed to corruption in the police, land office, education and health ministries and other public offices. "No mentionable change in corrupt practices has occurred at the field level," Prof Ahmad said. The Anticorruption Commission has succeeded in reducing large-scale corruption, but "petty corruption" has not come down, he said. Another database was prepared on the basis of surveys carried out on more than 3,000 households. Its findings, which are almost ready, will be made public by the end of April, the TIB chief said. The TIB has carried out the survey on people from different sections since the caretaker government took office after the exit of the BNP-led four-party coalition government. bdnews2
