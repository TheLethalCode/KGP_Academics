<TITLE> Texting scandal forces Finland foreign minister out </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Helsinki, April 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Finland will replace foreign minister Ilkka Kanerva after newspapers and magazines published suggestive text messages he sent to an erotic dancer, his party said on Tuesday. Kanerva sent about 200 text messages to Johanna Tukiainen, 29, and at first said they were related to her performing at his 60th birthday party. He later admitted the messages were not totally appropriate, but insisted until Monday he had done nothing wrong and was ready to continue in the office. Kanerva's conservative National Coalition Party, a key force in Finland's centre-right government, said it aims to appoint his successor on Tuesday. "This has been the toughest decision as the leader of the party. Ilkka is my friend and he has done his job as foreign minister brilliantly," party head Jyrki Katainen said. A government spokeswoman said replacing the minister was a party decision, which the president would later approve. In messages Kanerva had asked Tukiainen, who has posed nude in magazines and is the leader of the Scandinavian Dolls erotic dance troupe: "Would you like to do it in an exotic place? Where could it be?" "How it would be to touch you with fingers in a night club?" said another message sent the same night after 1 a.m. This is not the first time Kanerva has been in trouble over his mobile phone use. In 2005, when he was the deputy speaker of parliament, he bombarded two models with text messages.
