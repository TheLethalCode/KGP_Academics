 MOSCOW, April 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia's Interior Ministry said on Thursday it had brought no formal tax evasion charges against Bill Browder, the head of investment fund Hermitage Capital Management. "The investigative unit of the Interior Ministry brought no charges against William Browder," said the unit's spokeswoman Anzhela Kastuyeva, dismissing an earlier report in the Kommersant business daily. Browder, a British citizen, has been a major investor in Russia since the 1990s. He has been barred from Russia since November 2005 for unspecified reasons though Browder himself said the Russian government had cited "national security" concerns for the ban. Browder has a reputation as a champion of minority shareholders' rights and advocates greater transparency and better corporate governance at Russian companies. Hermitage, a $4 billion fund, continues to focus on Russia but Browder has raised a new $625 million fund to invest elsewhere.Hermitage said it had not received any information about the criminal case from the authorities. Kastuyeva said the investigative unit had only recently been handed the Browder case, which is under investigation. She declined to comment on the investigation's details. Kastuyeva said the Interior Ministry did not ask the court for the arrest warrant for Browder and Ivan Cherkasov, head of Hermitage's local office, who left Russia in 2007. She was not aware which agency had handled Browder's case previously. Russian media reported an investigation into Browder's tax record was launched in 2007 and has targeted Russian companies linked to Hermitage which paid out profits to offshore entities based in Cyprus. The investigation is focusing on share deals by Cyprus-based company Kameya. Hermitage is not a shareholder in Kameya but has advised the firm. Investigators told the Kommersant business daily that Kameya was buying shares in Russian energy firms including gas export monopoly Gazprom when trade in their Russian shares was restricted. Firms could profit from huge price differences between Gazprom's London and Moscow shares. Non-resident investors widely used such schemes until trading in Gazprom shares was liberalised in December 20
