<TITLE> French mission lands to treat Colombian hostage </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Bogota, April 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A French medical team touched down in Colombia on Thursday on a mission to try to treat rebel hostage Ingrid Betancourt, a French-Colombian politician who is believed seriously ill after six years in guerrilla captivity. A successful mission would be the first direct contact in years with Betancourt, a former presidential candidate and the highest profile captive held in jungle camps by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC guerrillas. President Alvaro Uribe says he will halt military operations in the area once the team has the location where it will treat Betancourt, but it was unclear whether France had contacted the guerrillas or won their support for the mission. French President Nicolas Sarkozy has made the release of Betancourt a foreign policy priority for his government, but so far few details have been revealed about the mission to attempt to treat her in a rebel camp hidden deep in the jungle. "The French humanitarian mission has given us some information about where they think Ingrid Betancourt is being held," Uribe told the France 3 television channel. "We are ready to suspend military operations in the area in question." Colombian armed forces commander Gen. Freddy Padilla said the French aircraft was waiting on the tarmac at Bogota's Catam military air base, fueled and ready to fly to anywhere it was required inside Colombia. Latin America's oldest left-wing insurgency, the FARC has been weakened by Uribe's U.S.-backed security crackdown, and violence from Colombia's four-decade conflict has ebbed as troops have pushed rebels into more remote areas. But attempts to reach a deal to free 40 key hostages, including three U.S. contractors captured in 2003, in exchange for jailed rebels are deadlocked over a FARC demand Uribe pull back troops from a swath of land to facilitate negotiations. Uribe, whose father was killed in a botched FARC kidnapping two decades ago, refuses to cede, but he has offered a smaller negotiating zone with an international observation team. France attempted a similar initiative in 2003 when it sent a military transport plane to Brazil's Amazon jungle region after Betancourt's family heard she might be released there. But Brazil and Colombia were angered when the aircraft arrived without warning in the Amazon city of Manaus, close to the Colombian border, and the FARC said it was completely unaware of the mission. POOR HEALTH Captives freed in recent months by the rebels in deals brokered by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez say Betancourt is seriously ill with hepatitis. Images from a rebel video released last year showed her gaunt and despondent in a hidden jungle camp. A mother of two adult children who was educated in France, Betancourt has been chained to a tree after several attempts to escape her captors, freed hostages say. Two top FARC commanders were killed in March, including Raul Reyes, a key contact for attempts to negotiate a hostage accord and the recent strikes against the FARC have raised questions about the rebel leadership and the chances of reaching an agreement. The Red Cross, which has participated in previous hostage releases, has said it has so far not been contacted by the FARC about the French medical mission. "It is a complex and dangerous mission full of uncertainty, but vital," said a French diplomatic source who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the initiative. Betancourt and her vice presidential candidate, Clara Rojas, were captured at a rebel roadblock while campaigning in 2002 in a southern province even after officials had warned them against traveling in the area. Rojas gave birth to a boy, Emmanuel, while in captivity in a secret jungle camp. She was one of the hostages released in January under a deal arranged by Chavez, a left-winger who has stoked tensions with Bogota by calling for more political recognition for the guerrillas. Started as a Marxist peasant army, the FARC once controlled large swaths of Colombia, but rebels have been driven back in recent years. US and European officials now label the FARC a cocaine-trafficking terrorist grou
