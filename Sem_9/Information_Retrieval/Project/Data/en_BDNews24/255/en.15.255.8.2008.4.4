 WASHINGTON, April 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The senior U.S. and North Korean nuclear negotiators will meet in Singapore on Monday to discuss the stalled effort to persuade Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear ambitions, a U.S. official said on Friday. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill will meet with Kim Kye-Gwan, North Korea's senior nuclear negotiator, as the United States seeks to convince North Korea to produce an overdue declaration of all its nuclear programs, said the official, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the negotiations. Six-party talks aimed at ending North Korea's nuclear program have been deadlocked since North Korea missed an end of 2007 deadline to declare its nuclear programs, as it was required to do under a deal with the United States, China, South Korea, Japan and Russia. Last week, North Korea's official media fired a rhetorical volley at the United States, blaming it for pushing the six-country talks into deadlock. In the past two weeks it has also test-fired missiles and expelled South Korean officials from a joint factory park in the North. Pyongyang began disabling its Soviet-era nuclear plant that produces plutonium for weapons late last year as part of a deal with regional powers in return for aid and an end to international isolation. The process has reached a stage where it would likely take it at least a year to get its Yongbyon nuclear plant running again, South Korean officials have said.
