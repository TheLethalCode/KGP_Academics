 Dhaka, April 3 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court has deferred until April 7 the charge-framing hearing in a graft case against detained former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, as she was feeling ill when produced in court Thursday. Hasina was taken from the special jail to the Special Judge's Court-1 to face charges involving illegal contracts being awarded for setting up three barge-mounted power plants during her 1996-2001 term as prime minister. At one stage during Thursday morning's proceedings in the Special Judge's Court-1 set up on the Sangsad Bhaban premises, the former prime minister felt a swoon. The court was notified and the judge adjourned the proceedings, deferring the hearing. Hasina had earlier told the court that the allegation against her was baseless. "I want to say something as a detainee. From whom shall I seek justice if I face injustice?" Hasina told the court. Judge Firoz Alam in reply said: "We the judges are not involved in such things." Hasina told the court that the condition of her eyes had worsened further. Barrister Shafiq Ahmed appealed to the court seeking exemption of Hasina from the case. Hasina's lawyer Yousuf Hossain Humayun had earlier trashed prison authorities' report on Hasina's sickness saying it was false. Another lawyer, Rezaur Rahman, told the court that they had appealed for a freeze on the hearing until Hasina got well. He said that there was no contradiction that Hasina was sick. "The entire nation is worried about her health. People were kept in the dark," Rezaur Rahman added. The judge told the defence lawyers that they failed to cooperate with the court, adding that the hearing would continue. "I don't know what happens outside. It may happen that the government withdraws the case the moment I frame a charge in it. The higher court may issue a stay order or you may show no confidence in me. Many things may happen. But the hearing must continue," the judge said. Shafiq Ahmed later submitted his appeal for exemption of Hasina from the case and argued: "The state of emergency was declared on January 11 and the trial of the cases involving incidents that have since taken place will be held under emergency powers rules." "But the allegation in the case was made on the basis of a 1996 incident. It cannot be brought under emergency rules." The Anticorruption Commission filed the case with Tejgaon Police Station on Sept 2, 2007, naming eight people including Hasina. The anti-graft body accused the former prime minister and the others of being variously involved in return for Tk 3 crore in bribe from Wartsila Power Development Limited Consortium's local representative, and Summit Group and United Group representatives, for awarding contracts to set up three barge-mounted power plants in Khulna, Shikalbaha and Haripur. Among the other accused in the case, former power secretary Toufique-e-Elahi Chowdhury is currently behind bars. bdnews24.com/pc/ff/ma/
