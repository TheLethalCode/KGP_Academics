 NEW YORK, March 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks fell and U.S. shares barely kept their head above water on Monday, while government bonds retained a bid as concern about the banking sector persisted. Investors found some encouragement in a survey showing less severe contraction for US Midwest manufacturers during March, but it proved short-lived. A big drag on the Dow, Merck & Co shares plummeted 15 percent after an expert panel recommended patients try cheaper cholesterol drugs before the company's newer medicines. This left the Dow Jones industrial average down 21 points at 12,191.57. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 indices were steady. European shares pared some losses after the Chicago data, but the FTSEEurofirst remained about 0.6 percent lower.

The Reuters/CRB index was up 0.37 percent. The agricultural sector, which had also benefited from the recent boom, was experiencing a different fate. European wheat futures were down more than 6 percent after larger-than-expected stock and plantings data from the USDA suggested the recent price spikes had been overdone. In currencies, the euro again flirted with record highs against the dollar after stronger euro-zone price data reinforced expectations that the European Central Bank would not start cutting interest rates so
