 Dhaka, April 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Petrobangla, the state-run Oil, Gas, and Mineral Corporation of Bangladesh, has given permission to British firm Cairn Energy plc for offshore gas exploration in the Bay of Bengal, an official said Saturday. Cairn is preparing for a three dimensional seismic survey of the Magnama and Hatiya structures in the Bay, Petrobangla director Mohammad Muqtadir Ali said. "Any further commercial activity will be decided following the outcome of the seismic survey," Muqtadir told bdnews24.com. Muqtadir said the British energy firm had discovered the presence of gas within the structures and sought permission to further appraise potential reserves and identify drilling spots. Cairn owns the right to explore gas and oil in the offshore block 16 of the Bay, 60 kilometres (38 miles), south of the port city of Chittagong. It started drilling and surveying in the 150 square km area last October. Cairn is also the operator in Bangladesh's sole offshore field at Sangu. Petrobangla has estimated potential gas reserves of 3.5 trillion cubic feet at Magnama and 1.8 trillion cubic feet at Hatiya. bdnews
