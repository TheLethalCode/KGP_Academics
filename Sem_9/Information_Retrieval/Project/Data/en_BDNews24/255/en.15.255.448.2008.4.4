 KOLKATA, India, April 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least 15 people were killed on Friday when a bus in which they were travelling veered off the road and plunged into a canal in Kolkata, police said. The driver of the bus, carrying 50 passengers, lost control while overtaking another vehicle in a busy street of Kolkata, the capital of West Bengal state, police and witnesses said. Rescuers took dozens of injured people to a hospital as divers looked for more bodies in the water. "The toll may rise later in the evening as we are looking for more bodies," Raj Kanojia, a senior police official, said in Kolkata.
