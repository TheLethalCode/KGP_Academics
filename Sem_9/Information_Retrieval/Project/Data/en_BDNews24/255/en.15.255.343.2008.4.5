<TITLE> Cameroon opposition slams constitutional reform </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 YAOUNDE, April 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cameroon's opposition and members of its ruling party on Saturday strongly criticised a constitutional amendment to remove term limits for President Paul Biya, who has ruled the West African country for 26 years. The government presented a draft amendment to parliament late on Friday to remove a ban on presidential third terms, which would allow Biya to stand again when his current seven-year mandate expires in 2011. With the government controlling 153 of the 180 seats in parliament, the bill is expected to be comfortably approved but even some members of the ruling Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM) said the move would stifle political life. "This idea of one man perpetuating himself in power is not good for our country. It's not democratic," said Paul Abine Ayah, a CPDM legislator. "If the bill is adopted, it will take us back some 200 years." He said that for the last two months, the government has been distributing large sums of money to ruling party members to vote for the reform. "They have come to me several times, even last evening, but I refused to take the money," said Ayah. "I will not sell my conscience and my country for money." Other members of the ruling party refused to comment on these allegations. Biya had confirmed his intention to stand again in an end of year speech, citing popular calls for him to stay in power and saying the term limit was undemocratic. Public anger at the plan, however, was one of the causes of five days of rioting in Cameroon in February which left some 100 people dead, according to civil rights campaigners. "He is heartless. He is insensitive to the feelings and thoughts of Cameroonians," said John Fru Ndi, leader of the main opposition Social Democratic Front (SDF). "What matters to him is only his power and how he can cling to it." Biya revised the constitution in 1996 -- after 14 years in office -- to extend the presidential term from five to seven years and make it renewable only once. He won the first seven-year term in 1997 and was re-elected in 2004, and is currently barred from running again in 2011. Biya's rule has been marred by human rights abuses and by Cameroon's reputation as one of one of the most corrupt countries in the world, particularly in the late 1990s. In recent years, some ministers and senior officials have been handed long jail terms for graft. Legislators in Nigeria, Zambia and Malawi were able to block efforts to enable third terms for presidents in recent years.
