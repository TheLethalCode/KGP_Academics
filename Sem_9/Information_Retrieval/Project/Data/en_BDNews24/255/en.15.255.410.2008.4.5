 WATFORD, England, April 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said on Saturday that international observers must be allowed to monitor a rerun of the disputed presidential election in Zimbabwe if no one is declared an outright winner. "We are determined that of course there are international observers if there is a second round," Brown told reporters at a summit of "progressive governance" leaders, including South African President Thabo Mbeki, near London. Brown said "everybody" was anxious that results should not be delayed and that the elections are seen to be fair.
