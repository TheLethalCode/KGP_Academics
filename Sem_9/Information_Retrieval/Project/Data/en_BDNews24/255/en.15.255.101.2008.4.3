The national flag carrier Biman bowled BKSP out for 217 in 49.5 overs after putting up a modest 219 for six in 50 overs riding on a 60-run knock from Tamim Iqbal. Earlier, opener Javed Omar gave a fine start making 39 while Alok Kapali (45) and Asif Hossain (36) played a key role in the middle to help Biman go beyond the 200-mark.

Opener Mohammad Mithun (35) and Mushfiqur Rahman (40) were also notable scorers for the BKSP. City Club handed a 28-run defeat to Victoria Sporting Club at the BKSP ground.
