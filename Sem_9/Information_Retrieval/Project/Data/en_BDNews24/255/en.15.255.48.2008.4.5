<TITLE> Zimbabwe's MDC says Mugabe preparing violence </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 HARARE, April 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe's opposition on Saturday accused President Robert Mugabe of deploying militias and planning a war to reverse the result of last weekend's election. Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) leader Morgan Tsvangirai said Mugabe was "preparing a war on the people" and deploying forces including liberation war veterans ahead of a presidential runoff vote. "Militants are being rehabilitated", Tsvangirai told a press conference, adding that the central bank was printing money "for the finance of violence." The MDC says it won last weekend's presidential vote as well as its officially declared victory in a parallel election in which Mugabe's ZANU-PF lost control of parliament for the first time in his 28-year rule. ZANU-PF and independent projections show Tsvangirai being forced into a presidential runoff after failing to win an absolute majority. "It is unfair ... for President Mugabe to even hint at a runoff. Violence will be the new weapon to reverse the people's will. We won this election without the need for a runoff," Tsvangirai said. Calling Mugabe a lame duck president, Tsvangirai said he "must concede to allow us to move on with the business of rebuilding and reconstructing the country." Earlier the Zimbabwe High Court postponed until Sunday a legal bid by the opposition to force the release of presidential election results after the electoral commission asked for more time to prepare its response. Armed police initially prevented MDC lawyers from entering the High Court before allowing them in. LONG DELAY The opposition and Western governments blame Mugabe for Zimbabwe's economic collapse, which has reduced much of its people to misery. He blames Western sanctions. The veteran president had looked wounded earlier in the week when ZANU-PF suffered its first election defeat. But a meeting of the party's politburo on Friday planned a fight-back and resolved he would contest a runoff against Tsvangirai. Party officials alleged widespread MDC bribery of electoral officials and said they would legally challenge the results in 16 constituencies, enough to overturn the result if successful. Under electoral law a presidential runoff must be held three weeks after results are released. So the longer the results take, the more time ZANU-PF has to organise. Analysts believe Mugabe will use his control of state apparatus, including the security forces, as well as pro-government militias to intimidate MDC supporters. Former colonial ruler Britain and the United States, both of whom have applied sanctions on Mugabe and his top officials, have criticised the election delay and suggested it could be the precursor to a rigged result. Thabo Mbeki, president of regional power South Africa, told the international community to wait for the full election results and said it was not time for action. "I think the situation for now is manageable," Mbeki told reporters as he arrived at a conference of "progressive governance" leaders near London. Mbeki led unsuccessful regional mediation attempts last year and South Africa is flooded with Zimbabwean economic refugees. The government-run Herald newspaper reported on Saturday a provincial elections officer had been arrested in Zimbabwe's Midlands region over charges that some polling stations had inflated vote tallies for the MDC and recorded lower votes for Mugabe and ZANU-PF candidates. "ZANU-PF in the province say they are checking every ward as they suspect a wider conspiracy," it said. The hardening of ZANU-PF's position has punctured optimism among Mugabe's critics inside and outside the country that he would stand down, clearing the way for economic reconstruction.
