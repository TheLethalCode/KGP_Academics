<TITLE> China completes naval frigate for Pakistan </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Beijing, April 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Shanghai shipyard has completed the first of four frigates for delivery to Pakistan, the China Daily reported on Saturday, in the first such order from China by the Pakistani navy. The deal is a "catalyst" for cooperation on construction of other vessels, the paper said, citing Pakistani chief of naval staff Muhammad Afzal Tahir. He will attend a launch ceremony for the F-22P frigate in Shanghai on Monday. The fourth and last vessel will be completed at a Karachi shipyard in 2013, to fulfill a pledge to transfer Chinese shipbuilding technology that was part of the April 2005 agreement to build the frigates. "They will be deployed for the defense of our maritime interests and to meet our commitments in other aspects of maritime diplomacy," the paper quoted Tahir as saying. It noted that Pakistan had previously procured such military hardware from Western countries, including Britain and France. The F-22P is a modification of a Chinese frigate that uses a Russian-designed main gun rather than a Chinese model. It will be armed with eight surface-to-air missiles and eight surface-to-surface missiles, according to an entry in the online encyclopedia Wikipedia. China and Pakistan, which share a border, are long-time allies, while tension persists in China's relations with Pakistan's arch-rival India. Tahir met with China's minister of defense and navy chief during his visit to Beijing this week. Last March, China's navy participated for the first time in a multilateral naval exercise near Karachi, that also included the U.S., British, Turkish, and French navies. Pakistan will host a similar exercise next March, Tahir said. China is developing its shipbuilding industry to rival yards in South Korea and Taiwan. This month, a Shanghai shipyard delivered the country's first-ever liquefied natural gas (LNG) carrier, four months behind schedule.
