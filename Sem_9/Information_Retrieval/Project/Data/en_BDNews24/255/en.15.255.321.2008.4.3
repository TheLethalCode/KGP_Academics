<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 3 (bdnews24.com)  The chairman of the Anticorruption Commission, Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury, said Thursday that the proposed Truth Commission must be formed in compliance with law. Chowdhury said the ACC did not oppose the formation of the commission. At a press conference, the ACC chief said the government must be careful in setting up the Truth Commission to avoid any conflict with the ACC. "The government sought a proposal from the ACC and the commission prepared a draft. The draft will be sent to the government soon," he said. The ACC is working to curb corruption, said Chowdhury. "It is not being used politically and is not working against any particular group," he said. He said 41 cases filed by the ACC had already been disposed of and 60 others were on trial. Chargesheets were submitted in 22 cases. Chowdhury said the anticorruption drive would be extended to upazila level. bdnew
