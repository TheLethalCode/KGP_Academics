 Maruf Mallick Telecoms Correspondent Dhaka, April 3 (bdnews24.com)  Faced with a poor quality of services, Teletalk planned to expand its network coverage in 2007, but the process failed to gain momentum, officials said Thursday. The state-owned mobile operator is foundering at a time when private competitors are fierce about having a bigger market share. Teletalk needs a quick decision to stay in the race, the officials said. Teletalk has only 10 lakh subscribers, the lowest among mobile operators, and far below the subscription figure of Grameenphone, the country's largest private mobile operator. GP has 1.72 crore subscribers, according to statistics released by Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission in March. Although the network covers 61 districts, its capacity is rudimentary in many places. Even in the capital city, subscribers complained of difficulty making or receiving calls. Some 339 upazilas are under the Teletalk network. It has installed 902 BTSs (base transmission/receiver station) across the country since it started its venture on March 31, 2005. The officials have said the company is losing market share because of poor coverage capacity while the sector is booming. The company's Board of Directors in November last year took the decision in principle to implement the network expansion plan, but the decision has repeatedly been thwarted since then. With the go-ahead, Teletalk awarded the job for network expansion to German company Siemens and Chinese Huawei in November. At a meeting on March 11, the Board of Directors decided to review the whole matter and suspended the expansion plan. "We had approved the decision in principle to extend network," Md Iqbal Mahmood, chairman of the Board of Directors of Teletalk, told bdnews24.com earlier this week. "But we have halted awarding the work order to Huawei and Siemens," said Mahmood, also telecoms secretary. He said they hoped to finalise the matter as soon as a new managing director takes the helm. "Since this involves people's money, we cannot rush to a decision. That is why it is being delayed," he said. "As a government institution we need to follow some rules and regulations," he said. Meanwhile, a top official of Teletalk said Thursday if the network were not extended immediately, the existence of the company would be at stake. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said they were not able to increase the subscribers' base because of the poor network capacity. The company's network is frequently overlapped with other telecoms companies, the official said. The idea of expansion originally came in July last year and Teletalk decided to install BTSs accordingly. But the company's board failed to take a decision initially. In November it nodded to the Teletalk proposal for the expansion, but halted the process in December. Then in January, the board decided to up its subscribers' base to 18 lakh from 12 lakh by expanding the network capacity, but the decision was stayed again in February. On March 11 this year, the board suspended the decision of awarding the work order to Siemens and Huawei. The suspension came as the board lately argued that the contract awarding was not transparent and the process be halted until the next direction comes. The March 11 meeting also decided to review SWAP proposal through open tender. It also decided to identify the areas that have less number of BTS and install new stations there. According to the officials, the company moved to give work order to Siemens and Huawei to install 600 BTSs at a cost of Tk 418 crore under a framework contract and without a new tender call. bdnews24.
