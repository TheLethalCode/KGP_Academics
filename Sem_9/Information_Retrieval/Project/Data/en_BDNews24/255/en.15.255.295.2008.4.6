 Jakarta, April 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indonesia's President faces a key decision this week: the appointment of a new central bank governor who can tackle inflation and restore the reputation of an institution that has been buffeted by scandals. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, whose two previous nominations for the post of governor were rejected last month by a parliamentary committee, has now fielded Boediono, his chief economics minister, for the job. But the appointment, critical for the health of Southeast Asia's biggest economy given soaring food and fuel prices, is seen as increasingly political in the run-up to elections. "Parliament is filled with people who put the interests of their political parties ahead of the nation's interests," said Mochtar Pabottinggi, political analyst with the Indonesian Institute of Sciences. Boediono, a well-respected technocrat with central bank and finance ministry experience, is due to be questioned by a parliamentary committee on Monday. A decision on whether to appoint him is expected by the end of the week. Inflation spiked up to 8.17 percent in March due to a surging prices for rice, soybeans, wheat and fuel, while the central bank's benchmark interest rate is currently 8.0 percent. The fear now is that Bank Indonesia's easing of interest rates is over, and that the next move will be up, not down. In the run-up to parliamentary and presidential elections in 2009, the new central bank governor must be able to withstand political interference, particularly if politicians push for looser monetary policies or try to solicit bribes. While Boediono, 65, is seen as more likely to be approved by the parliamentary committee, his appointment could pose further problems for Yudhoyono who will have to find a well-respected replacement as chief economics minister. SERIOUS SETBACK Indonesia's central bank has been the subject of various probes in the past decade, particularly over its controversial role in lending billions of dollars in emergency funds to banks at the height of the 1997-98 financial crisis. Burhanuddin Abdullah, Bank Indonesia's outgoing governor, and two colleagues are suspects in a graft inquiry concerning a foundation linked to the central bank that made illegal payments to members of parliament. Abdullah, whose five-year term ends in May, denies any wrongdoing. Some supporters say the investigation was timed to stop him standing for a second term. Initially, Yudhoyono proposed two outsiders to replace Abdullah -- Agus Martowardojo, president director of Indonesia's biggest lender Bank Mandiri , and Raden Pardede, vice president director of a state asset management firm. Both were seen as strong candidates who could shake up Bank Indonesia. But Yudhoyono faced a serious setback when parliament turned down both names citing their lack of competence. Analysts said the decision, the first time such a rejection has occurred since the nomination system was introduced a decade ago, was a sign of heightened political tension ahead of elections next year and reflected Yudhoyono's political weakness. While Yudhoyono won the presidency with 61 percent of the vote in 2004, his Democratic Party won only 7 percent of the vote in the 2004 parliamentary elections, giving it just 57 seats. So Yudhoyono's government relies on the support of Golkar, the country's largest party, which is chaired by Vice President Jusuf Kalla, and other parties that supported his candidacy. "It shows that the political infighting has started ahead of the 2009 elections," said economist Sri Adiningsih of Gadjah Mada University.
