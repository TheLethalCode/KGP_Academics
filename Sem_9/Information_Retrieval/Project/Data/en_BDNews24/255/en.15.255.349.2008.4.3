 BAMAKO, April 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Government attack helicopters killed or wounded dozens of Malian Tuareg rebels, a military source said on Thursday, the first raid of its kind in the rumbling Saharan conflict. Wednesday's attack targeted fighters loyal to Tuareg rebel leader Ibrahim Ag Bahanga who the army said tried to prevent a military convoy from reaching the northeastern town of Kidal, 1,250 km (780 miles) northeast of the capital Bamako. "The reinforcements arrived in Kidal without a problem at around 5.30 p.m. (1730 GMT) on Wednesday. It is difficult to give a toll, especially for the other side," said a military official, quoting eye-witness reports. "What we can say is that we have been told about two Toyota (pickups) filled with dead bodies, as well as several wounded including a right-hand man of Bahanga, and maybe even Bahanga himself," said the official, who declined to be identified. Privately-owned daily newspaper Le Republicain, published in Bamako, reported that 62 people had been killed in the fighting, but gave no source for the information. The raid, using Russian-made Mi-24 helicopters, marked an escalation in the conflict. Army commanders have been calling for air power to help their operations in northern Mali, where raids by nomadic Tuareg rebels have intensified in recent weeks. Rebel leaders have been fighting the army presence in what they see as their zone in an apparent effort to maintain control of traditional Saharan smuggling routes. Mali's eastern neighbour Niger faces its own Tuareg-led revolt which has killed more than 60 government soldiers in a year, mainly in land mine attacks near the northern uranium mining zone which provides a large chunk of state revenues. Malian army officials said Bahanga's rebels had used land mines to try to prevent the military convoy reaching Kidal, an ancient trading town on a route from Mali's southeastern town of Gao north through the Sahara towards the border with Algeria. The army clashes with Tuareg rebels have taken place in the region where al Qaeda militants are thought to be holding two Austrian tourists seized in Tunisia in February. However, the violence appeared unrelated to the kidnapping and some reports suggest the pair have been moved to neighbouring Mauritania. Light-skinned Tuareg nomads launched revolts from Kidal in the 1960s and 1990s demanding greater freedom from a black African-dominated government seated far away in Bamako. Peace agreements after the 1990s rebellion went some way to addressing Tuareg demands, with former fighters integrated into the army and Tuareg politicians winning more responsibility, but the region remains restive and awash with arms.
