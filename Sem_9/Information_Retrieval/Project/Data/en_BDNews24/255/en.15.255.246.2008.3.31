 ROME, March 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manager Alex Ferguson said he was confident Manchester United had AS Roma sized up ahead of Tuesday's Champions League quarter-final first leg at the Stadio Olimpico. "I think, because of playing them so many times, we are aware of exactly what Roma is about," the English champions' boss told a news conference on Monday. "The first time we came here we found the first 20 minutes very difficult, the way they pressed the game, and it took us a long time to adjust. Now we are playing them for the sixth time and hopefully we have overcome those difficulties." United knocked Roma out at this stage of the competition last year with a 7-1 drubbing at Old Trafford after losing the first leg 2-1. The Premier League leaders also had the better of the group-stage encounters between the sides, winning 1-0 at home and drawing 1-1 in the Italian capital. Ferguson said he was optimistic goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar and defender Patrice Evra would be fit but that midfielder Michael Carrick remained a major injury doubt. He added that Cristiano Ronaldo's remarkable form would be an extra weapon against a Roma side without injured top-scorer and captain Francesco Totti. BIG ADVANTAGE "We are absolutely delighted we are bringing a player a year later to Rome with an incredible improvement and goal-scoring performances. That's a big advantage to us," he said. He added that the Portugal international would soon answer those who question his ability to repeat his domestic form in European competition. "He's only just turned 23. With two or three years of maturity, that is a question that will not be asked," he said. "We are seeing development in every department of his game in domestic football. The more he plays in Europe, the more he'll get used to it and the more we'll see his qualities." Midfielder Paul Scholes also paid tribute to Ronaldo: "I've been lucky to have played with a lot of top, top players and I think Cristiano has to be the top now, for what he's done this season," he said. Scholes said he was not expecting a repeat of the 7-1 romp. "I think that's forgotten," he said. "That was a special night. We know that's not going to happen very often." Ferguson agreed that Roma were now a much tougher prospect, even without Totti. "They are second in the (Italian) league and they have a fantastic chance of winning the title," he said. "That's a measure of their improvement. "Obviously, Totti is a very influential figure in the Roma team. I'm sure (coach Luciano) Spalletti and the rest of the players will overcome his absence. They have to.
