<TITLE> Asian shares head for worst quarter in 5 yrs </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Rafael Nam HONG KONG, March 31 (Reuters) - Asian shares fell on Monday, heading for their worst quarterly performance in over five years, on persistent concerns about the global credit crunch and the impact of weakening U.S. consumer demand on the region's exports. Oil prices, among the top performing asset classes so far this year, extended falls from the previous session after the restart of a crude pipeline system in Iraq eased concerns over supply. A choppy dollar kept other commodity prices steady, following a quarter in which a slumping U.S. currency has sent the prices of asset classes such as gold to record highs. "With the possibility of further writedowns and profit warnings, you're seeing investors more cautious about the financials and moving into more defensive sectors," said Savanth Sebastian, equities economist at CommSec in Australia. The MSCI's measure of Asian stocks outside Japan fell 0.5 percent by 0205 GMT. Asian equity markets have had a tough quarter amid the prospects of a looming U.S. recession and a worsening global financial credit crisis that has led to billions of dollars in writedowns in the financial sector. The MSCI's index has fallen 13.6 percent so far this year, its worst performance since the quarter ended in September 2002. These same concerns continued to hit Asian shares in the last day of the quarter after U.S. department store operator J.C. Penney Co Inc on Friday cut its first-quarter earnings forecast -- setting up doubts about the health of U.S. consumer demand. Worries about the health of the financial sector also continued after Oppenheimer & Co analyst Meredith Whitney said U.S. banks including Citigroup are likely to announce dividend cuts in April. Tokyo shares fell 1.5 percent amid caution ahead of key domestic economic data this week, while Shanghai's benchmark index also fell 1.5 percent after rumours last week that the government would announce market-friendly steps failed to materialise. Japanese trading house Marubeni Corp plunged 6.2 percent after Lehman Brothers said it would sue the company over what it said was a fraud by Marubeni employees. A source said Lehman had been fleeced for more than $355 million in the scam. Shares in Taiwan and Hong Kong fell more than 1 percent, while indexes in South Korea and Australia were down less than 1 percent each. OIL FALLS U.S. crude for May delivery fell $1.03 cents to $104.59 a barrel, after already dropping about $2 on Friday, after Iraq restarted a crude supply pipeline system eased fears of an extended export disruption from the country's oil-rich south. Oil prices hit a record high of $111.80 in mid-March as prices have surged as a slumping U.S. dollar, and as investors have sought a hedge against rising inflationary pressures. Gold, which has also hit records this quarter, was steadier at $931.90 an ounce, virtually unchanged from late U.S. trade on Friday. The dollar experienced choppy trade against the yen on Monday, as Japanese importers' demand for the U.S. currency was offset by concerns over the U.S. economy. The greenback rose to 99.60 from around 99.30 yen in late U.S. trade on Friday, after falling as low as 98.80 earlier in the session on electronic trading platform EBS.
