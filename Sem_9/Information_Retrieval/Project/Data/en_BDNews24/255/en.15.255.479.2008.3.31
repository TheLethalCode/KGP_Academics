 RIO DE JANEIRO, March 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Striker Adriano, on loan from Inter Milan, scored twice in the first 20 minutes to help Sao Paulo win 2-0 at Bragantino in the Paulista championship on Sunday. Adriano's first goal came in the ninth minute when he picked up Hernanes's pass and broke clear of the Bragantino defence. Despite nearly tripping over as he attempted to round the Bragantino goalkeeper, he managed to keep his balance and score. Eleven minutes later, Adriano, hoping to revive his career after an unhappy period in Italy, was on hand to tap in the second at the far post following a corner. The win kept Sao Paulo third in the table with 35 points from 18 games and one to play. The top four teams qualify for the semi-finals. Chile midfielder Jorge Valdivia produced another inspirational performance to help Palmeiras beat Sao Caetano 3-1 on Saturday and chalk up their eighth win in a row. The win guaranteed Palmeiras, led by former Real Madrid and Brazil coach Vanderlei Luxemburgo, a semi-final place. Valdivia, banned by Chile for 10 matches for indiscipline, provided a pinpoint cross for Alex Mineiro to head the opener in the 23rd minute and scored the third himself in the 70th. Defender Pierre added Palmeiras's other goal before halftime and Douglas notched Sao Caetano's consolation. Palmeiras, who have 37 points from 18 games, are second behind Guaratingueta, who lead on the number of games won after a 2-0 victory over Sertaozinho. Corinthians stayed one point outside the top four after beating Marilia 3-1 while Santos's chances ended when they drew 1-1 with Rio Clar
