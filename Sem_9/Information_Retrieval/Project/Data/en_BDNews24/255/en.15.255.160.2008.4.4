 LONDON, April 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A gloomy outlook from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke weighed on European stocks and prospects for Wall Street's open on Thursday although investors managed solid gains in Asia and broadly lifted the dollar. Bernanke conceded for the first time on Wednesday that the US economy may slip into recession, although he also said growth should pick up later this year as interest rate cuts and other emergency moves take root. The tone depressed US stocks overnight and some vestiges of the mood hung over Europe, particularly the banking sector. US stock futures pointed to a weak start in New York. "We had an exceptionally weak first quarter and started the second quarter with a strong rally, but there are clearly question marks over whether the rally can sustain itself," said Darren Winder, head of macro and strategy research at Cazenove. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.3 percent with banks the top-weighted losers. Euro zone services growth slowed further in March as the credit crunch tightened its grip, according to final data from the RBS/NTC Eurozone Purchasing Managers survey. Retail sales in the bloc, meanwhile, turned out much weaker than expected in February, according to the European Union's statistics office. Asian shares climbed strongly with investors focusing on resource shares. MSCI's measure of Asian stocks outside Japan rose 1.2 percent and Japan's Nikkei average rose 1.5 percent or 200 points to 13,389.90. The broader TOPIX rose 1.4 percent to 1,299.64. "We are at an interesting juncture where we've got negative forces like the U.S. credit and subprime problems and positive forces from all the demand for resources," said Peter Vann, head of investment research at Constellation Capital Management in Australia. Market focus was also on US jobs data due on Friday. It was seen as a gauge both of the state of US growth and as a marker for the likely pressures on U.S. consumers, a major driver of the global economy. Non-farm payrolls are expected to show the economy shed jobs in March for a third month running, but some analysts see scope for an upside surprise after a report on Wednesday showed the private sector added 8,000 jobs against forecasts for a 48,000 loss. DOLLAR BUMP Currency markets were also generally more bullish about the longer-term prospects for the US economy, at least in terms of interest rate expectations. The dollar rose broadly with focus on a recent run of firmer than expected U.S. data that suggests interest rates may not need to be slashed as much as previously thought. Despite Bernanke's remarks, markets are now pricing in just a 10 percent chance of a half percentage point US rate cut this month -- down from as much as 62 percent last Friday. The euro was down 0.9 percent at $1.5553, having retreated from record peaks above $1.59 touched last month. The dollar was up 0.5 percent at 102.70 yen. Euro zone government bonds were flat. The interest rate-sensitive Schatz yielded 3.522 percent and the 10-year Bund 3.984 perce
