 Dhaka, March 31 (bdnews24.com)The Awami League's acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam Monday alleged that the government was luring away "young and honest" workers from different political parties and trying to task them with "special responsibilities". The AL leader demanded an immediate end to such 'activities'. Speaking at an Independence Day discussion organised by the party's city unit at the AL central office on Bangabandhu Avenue, he said: "If the government had been neutral, it would not have been looking for candidates to run for upazila and national elections." Ashraful said: "I doubt this government is working for a free and neutral election." "Party workers under 40 are being called in by the government and asked whether they could take on any special responsibility," he alleged. "The bio-data of every honest and competent candidate of every political party including the Awami League is being collected in every district," the AL leader further alleged. Ashraful said that the government cannot decide who will contest the Jatiya Sangsad elections. He said that these 'activities' of the government proved it had no intention to hold an "election acceptable to all". bdnews24.
