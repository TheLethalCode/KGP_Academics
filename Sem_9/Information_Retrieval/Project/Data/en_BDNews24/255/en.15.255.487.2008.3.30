 NEW YORK, March 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Dith Pran, a photojournalist whose harrowing experience in a Cambodian forced labor camp under the Khmer Rouge was dramatized in the film "The Killing Fields," died on Sunday at the age of 65. He died of pancreatic cancer at a New Brunswick, New Jersey, hospital, his employer, The New York Times, said on its Web site. Dith spent the last weeks of his life in the hospital surrounded by family and friends, including Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Sydney Schanberg, who worked with him for The Times during the Cambodian civil war.
