 Dhaka, Mar 30 (bdnews24.com)The chairman of the National Board of Revenue, along with hundreds of fellow passengers, was stuck for almost 24 hours aboard a river launch as it ran aground in a raging storm Saturday night. NBR chief Muhammad Abdul Mazid boarded the MV Masud Saturday evening after attending a pre-budget discussion in Barisal. The vessel encountered a severe storm at about 9.45pm, near an area called Hizla, which led the vessel to become grounded on a sandbar, known locally as 'Faruk Char', for twelve hours. Mazid told bdnews24.com he was scheduled to arrive in Dhaka at about 6am Sunday. "But we eventually reached Dhaka at six in the evening." "I was scheduled for an NBR meeting on budget issues Sunday morning and another of NBR programme in Chittagong in the afternoon," Mazid said. "But I missed both of them due to the delay." The NBR chief said panic had gripped the vessel's passengers when the storm struck. "Everyone was very relieved upon arriving Dhaka," he added. bdnews2
