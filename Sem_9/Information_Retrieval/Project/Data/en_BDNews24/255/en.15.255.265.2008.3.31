 Dhaka, March 31 (bdnews24.com) - Abahani booters Monday joined the national camp ahead of the AFC Challenge Cup and the SAFF Championship after hosts Nepal declined to host the AFC President's Cup in April. Six Abahani players, selected for the preliminary squad of the national side, were busy with club practice ahead of the AFC President's Cup, which was originally slated for April 20-24 but is now likely to be held in May in Bangladesh after Nepal's refusal following political unrest. The national football camp started on March 28. "Except Abul Hossain, goalkeeper Biplob Bhattacharya, Jahid Hasan Emili, Jahed Parvez, Mehdi Hasan Ujjal, Wali Faisal and Abul Hossain joined the camp at Bangabandhu National Stadium," Coach Abu Yousuf told bdnews24.com Monday. The footballers are scheduled to go to the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan Tuesday, for a month-long residential camp, before going on to Kyrgyzstan to take part in the preliminary round of the AFC Challenge Cup from May 5-10. Of 28 players, three are yet to join the camp, and coach Yousuf said he would wait for those three players till Tuesday, otherwise he would take action against them. The three who did not join the camp are Abul Hossain and Mohammedan's Jumratul Islam Mithu and Jahid Hossain. Bangladesh will also take part in the SAFF Championship, scheduled for June 3-14 in Sri Lanka and the Maldives. bdnew
