 NEW DELHI, April 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa's Haroon Lorgat has been appointed the new chief executive of the International Cricket Council (ICC), the governing body announced on Friday. The 47-year-old Lorgat will take over from Malcolm Speed after the governing body's annual conference starting on June 29, the ICC said in a statement. Lorgat, a former South Africa chief selector, was chosen a week after his compatriot Imtiaz Patel turned down the offer after being named the preferred candidate. The new appointment was confirmed by the board after Lorgat met the ICC president-elect David Morgan in Pretoria on Wednesday and the recruitment committee cleared him. Lorgat, a former first class cricketer, headed the selection panel from 2004 until last year and is currently an executive director of a South African investment company. As a left-handed batsman and right arm medium-pacer, Lorgat played first class cricket for Eastern Province and Transvaal, scoring 2,813 runs and taking 191 wickets. He served on the finance committees of the South African board and during the 2003 World Cup, jointly hosted with Zimbabwe and Kenya. ICC president Ray Mali welcomed the appointment. "I'm delighted Haroon will assume the role of the next CEO for the ICC," South African Mali said. "His background in cricket, business and administration is ideally suited to the role and I'm sure he will do an outstanding job in leading our global game in the right direction. "It is great news for the ICC and the game around the world that Haroon has accepted our offer and he now has the opportunity to help forge an exciting future for the game." Lorgat said he was keen to take up the post. "I'm grateful to the ICC for appointing me as its new CEO and look forward to an exciting and rewarding journey in a game I've truly loved from a very young age. "I am under no illusion about the challenges that await me but chose challenges are also opportunities and I cannot wait to start work at the highest level in such a great game
