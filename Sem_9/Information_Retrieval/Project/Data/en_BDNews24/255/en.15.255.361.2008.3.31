<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 31 (bdnews24.com)  The caretaker government has decided to activate the Chittagong Hill Tracts Land Commission after seven long years, an adviser said Monday. "The government will make all arrangements to activate the CHT land commission during the remainder of its term," food adviser AMM Shawkat Ali said. The land commission was formed in 2001, in accordance with the CHT peace accord, but it was never functional as it faced a number of barriers including insufficient manpower, lack of budget allocation and infrastructural difficulties. The commission will appoint one chairman and two members, said Shawkat in his speech to a roundtable on "Land Problems at CHT and Solutions" at the Women Volunteers Association auditorium in Dhanmondi. A court will also be set up so that everyday land disputes can be resolved, he said. However, it is still a matter for discussion whether two commissions will be formed  one for the indigenous people of the hills and another for the indigenous people of the plains, the adviser said. "The scope and reach of the commission should also be fixed." Raja Devasish Roy, the chief adviser's special assistant in charge of CHT affairs, as a special guest at the roundtable said: "The government will activate the land commission and set up district judges' courts at the same time." The commission will ensure the land rights of the tribal communities as well as the Bangalees, Devasish said, adding: "But the commission will do its job maintaining the policies and traditions of the tribes." "The tradition of the tribal communities does not claim that all of them should have land documents." The special assistant also suggested that there should be detailed talks about the process by which the lands of the hills will now be leasedand whether the Bangalees now living in the hill tracts would be resettled if their leases were cancelled. bdnew
