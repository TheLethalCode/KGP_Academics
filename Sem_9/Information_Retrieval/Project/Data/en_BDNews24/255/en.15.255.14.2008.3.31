 Dhaka, March 31 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission Monday submitted a chargesheet against BNP senior joint secretary-general Tarique Rahman on charges of illegally amassing wealth and suppressing wealth information. ACC assistant director Md Toufiqul Islam submitted the chargesheet to Magistrate Md Golam Rabbani at the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court, Dhaka. The ACC approved the chargesheet on March 27 against former prime minister Khaleda Zia's elder son for illegally amassing property worth about Tk 2.75 crore and concealing wealth to the tune of Tk 2.16 crore. The commission also approved chargesheets against Tarique's wife Zobaida Rahman and mother-in-law Syeda Iqbalmand Banu for assisting him in accumulating the wealth. Tarique's wife and mother-in-law have since claimed Tk 35 lakh of the allegedly illegal earning were in fact legal, although this is disputed by the ACC. ACC deputy director Zahurul Huda filed the case with Kafrul Police Station on Sept 26 last year. According to case details, the accused obtained property worth about Tk 4.82 crore beyond his known sources of income. He also allegedly concealed information on wealth worth around Tk 4.23 crore in his ACC wealth statement. The BNP leader submitted a wealth statement of Tk 1.37 crore to the ACC through the jail authorities on June 10 last year. bdnew
