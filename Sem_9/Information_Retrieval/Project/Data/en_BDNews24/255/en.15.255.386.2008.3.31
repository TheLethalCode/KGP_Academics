 Dhaka, March 31 (bdnews24.com) People must desist from acting in ways detrimental to national aspirations, if Bangladesh is to be transformed from an agrarian economy into a nation of middle income earners, the chief adviser said on Monday. Speaking at an awards ceremony for the country's top exporters, Fakhruddin Ahmed said: "Irrespective of caste, creed, profession and social situation, I trust that all people, if united, will be successful in transforming Bangladesh into a middle income country." A total 82 successful businessmen received national export trophies and certificates at Monday's ceremony at Osmani Memorial Auditorium "Our exporters have been innovative through experimenting with a number of new approaches," the chief adviser said. But at least 85 percent of Bangladesh's export earnings still hinge on a handful of items, Fakhruddin added, naming readymade garments, knitwear, raw hides and jute goods. "An export target of $14.50 billion has been set for the current fiscal year, in line with the progress seen in the export arena in the recent past," the chief adviser said. "We must harness our comparative advantages in producing and marketing merchandise to face the global competition." To augment export earnings, Fakhruddin said, the country must focus on new sectors and products which are in demand globallysuch as processed foods, finished leather goods, light engineering products, electronic produces, fresh fruit and flowers, handicrafts, indigenous textile products, herbal plants and medicines. Many of these have been declared 'special development sectors' by the government, the CA added. "The government is taking necessary steps to develop infrastructure crucial to increasing exports," he said, citing road and highway networks, telecommunications, water, gas and power supplies and port management. "Progress in these areas will cut both import and export costs," the chief adviser said. Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman, commerce secretary Firoz Ahmed, FBCCI president Annisul Huq and Export Promotion Bureau vice chairman Shahab Ullah also spoke on the occasion. bdnews24.c
