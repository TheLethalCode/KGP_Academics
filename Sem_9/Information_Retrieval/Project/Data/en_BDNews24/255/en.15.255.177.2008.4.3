 BUCHAREST, April 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - NATO leaders confirmed on Thursday their "firm and shared long-term commitment" to Afghanistan but also pledged to aid a transition to Afghan forces by boosting their training. "We will provide the training teams and help provide the equipment needed to meet the goal of an effective 80,000-strong Afghan army by 2010," the leaders of NATO countries and all those participating in its peacekeeping mission said in a statement agreed at a summit, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters.
