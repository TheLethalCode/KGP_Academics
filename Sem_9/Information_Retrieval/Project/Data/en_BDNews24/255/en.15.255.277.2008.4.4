<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 3 (bdnews24.com)A faction of the Workers Party of Bangladesh said Friday the food adviser had played a "cruel joke" by commenting on the situation of the poor people bearing the brunt of rising food costs. The president of the fringe party, Khandaker Ali Abbas, asked adviser AMM Shawkat Ali to apologise for describing the situation created by the food price spiral as "hidden hunger", not as a famine-like situation. In a joint statement, Abbas and the party's general secretary Saiful Haque condemned the statement of the adviser. They asked the adviser to explain how many people will have to die to call it a famine-like situation. The leaders demanded introduction of a rationing system to face "famine", enough food for 1.5 crore people for two months, intensifying the mass distribution system, augmenting government food stocks and preventing waste. bdnew
