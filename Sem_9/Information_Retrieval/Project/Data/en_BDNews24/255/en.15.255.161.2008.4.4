<TITLE> US House leader: Colombia trade deal possible </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Washington, April 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Democratic leaders in the U.S. House of Representatives want to pass a Colombia free trade agreement this year, but problems with the deal and legislation to help displaced workers must be worked out, House Majority Whip James Clyburn said on Thursday. "We want to do this," said Clyburn of South Carolina, who is the third-ranking Democrat in the House. He added: "I would suspect that if the legislation gets in good enough shape that she (House Speaker Nancy Pelosi) feels comfortable bringing it to the floor, I'm almost sure it will pass." Clyburn made his remarks to reporters after delivering a speech to a private group on this year's legislative agenda. Later in the day, Clyburn issued a statement outlining hurdles. "There remains widespread concern in Congress about several issues in Colombia, including the level of violence against union members, civil society leaders and civilians," he said. "I hope the administration would follow the established protocol of congressional consultation before submitting a Colombia FTA (free trade agreement). Failure to do so would risk an adverse vote on the agreement." Noting Congress approved foreign aid funding last year to help Colombia address some of its problems, Clyburn added, "We must remain actively and positively engaged with Colombia." Rep. Jim McCrery of Louisiana, the senior Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, which oversees trade deals, told the same group the White House might formally submit the Colombia free trade deal to Congress next week, setting off a 90-day timetable for Congress to act on it. McCrery said that if Congress does not debate the measure this year, it likely would face tougher prospects next year, after November's elections, which could send to the House and Senate more Democrats opposed to the trade agreements negotiated by the White House. ASSISTANCE FOR DISPLACED WORKERS But Pelosi, a California Democrat who favors some legislative changes, told reporters, "I have not been informed by the administration that they will be sending up the legislation next week. I don't recommend it." Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus agreed. The White House is reluctant to commit publicly to a date when it will submit the deal, but Deputy Trade Representative John Veroneau acknowledged that time is short. "We will continue to work with the leadership to find a way to assure its passage. At the end of the day, we strongly believe this agreement will pass," he said in an interview. Baucus said he was working with the Bush administration, Pelosi and Sen. Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, on legislation to expand federal assistance for workers who have lost their jobs because of trade. Baucus and Clyburn said they were hopeful that reaching agreement on that would set the stage for congressional approval. "I don't know of any other preconditions," Baucus said in remarks to a business group. Clyburn said, "That's a big part of what (House Ways and Means Committee Chairman) Charlie Rangel's concerns are." Clyburn, who is responsible for rounding up enough Democratic votes to pass legislation on the House floor, said he met on Wednesday with Democratic chairmen and other House leaders to discuss the Colombia bill. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer remains undecided on whether to back the trade deal, a spokeswoman said. Besides concerns about labor protections, many Democrats also want stronger environmental protections linked to the free-trade deal with Colomb
