 WASHINGTON, April 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cyprus' top diplomat on Friday warned against excessive optimism about peace talks on the divided island, but said problems in negotiations between Greek and Turkish Cypriots should not derail the process. Greek and Turkish Cypriots last month agreed to relaunch talks, hoping to end a 30-year standoff that is an obstacle to Turkey's hopes of joining the European Union and a source of tension with its NATO partner and neighbor, Greece. Cypriot Foreign Minister Markos Kyprianou said that while things were moving fast after a five-year stalemate in reunification efforts, sorting out thorny property, security and population issues "will not be an easy process." "There could be problems in the future, but it does not mean the end of the process," he said in Washington before a meeting with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte. Kyprianou pointed to a dispute on Thursday when authorities opened a thoroughfare cutting through the Greek and Turkish Cypriot quarters of Nicosia for the first time in about half a century as an example of potential snags. Ledra Street was opened then abruptly closed for two hours in a row over the presence of Turkish Cypriot police in the disputed, U.N.-controlled no-man's land between the two sides. Cyprus, an EU member since 2004, wanted to take as much time as necessary to work out disputes and believed "there should not be deadlines for the sake of deadlines," said Kyprianou. But he said the government in Cyprus believed the leaders of the Turkish community, whose breakaway state is recognized only by Turkey, "see the benefits of reuniting the island." The east Mediterranean island has been divided since a Turkish invasion in 1974 triggered by a brief Greek-inspired coup. The last major U.N. initiative ended in failure in 2004, when Greek Cypriots rejected a reunification blueprint accepted by Turkish Cypriots. Aides to Greek Cypriot leader Demetris Christofias, elected president of Cyprus in February, and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat are conducting preparatory talks, and the two men are set to relaunch negotiations by the end of June.
