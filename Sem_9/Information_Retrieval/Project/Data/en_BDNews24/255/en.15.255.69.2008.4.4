 PARIS, April 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks gained ground in early trade on Friday, reversing some of the losses from the previous session, with UBS up on news that a former CEO added pressure on the troubled Swiss bank to restructure. But investors remained cautious ahead of key monthly US jobs data that could confirm a US economic downturn. British Energy was Europe's the top gainer, up 4.6 percent after a report on French newspaper La Tribune's website that said EDF's board has given the go-ahead to launch a takeover bid for the UK firm. No immediate comment was available from either company. At 0857 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.4 percent at 1,316.96 points. The index, down 13 percent on the year, is on track to end the week with a gain of 4 percent. Shares of financial institutions, which soared earlier this week on hopes that the worst of the asset writedowns was over, were mixed on Friday, with UniCredit up 0.9 percent and Societe Generale down 1.7 percent. US non-farm payrolls numbers, due at 1230 GMT, are expected to show more job losses in the world's biggest economy. Economists in a Reuters survey forecast a loss of 60,000 jobs in the United States in March, compared with a loss of 63,000 in February. "If US jobs data continue to deteriorate, consumer spending will suffer, and that is key to the health of the U.S. economy," said Benoit De Broissia, analyst at Richelieu Finance. "Meanwhile, stocks have not much room on the upside, because it will take some time for the emergency measures taken by central banks to soothe the credit crisis. For Europe, there is also the strong euro factor: that will trim corporate results." UBS was up 2.5 percent, as pressure on the bank to break up intensified when activist investor and former chief executive Luqman Arnold demanded it shake up its governance and structure. Drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline rose 1.2 percent after the company said it had won U.S. approval to sell an oral vaccine to prevent a leading cause of severe diarrhoea in infants. Rival Astrazeneca gained 3 percent after Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the drugmaker to 2,200 pence from 2,150 pence and kept its "equal-weight" rating. "At the moment the driving force for 'good' in the markets has been the Fed's actions, whilst at the same time actual economic data has been viewed from a less than favourable outlook," Simon Denham, managing director of Capital Spreads wrote in a note. "This is a feature of market trends and is demonstrated in bull runs where rose-tinted glasses view every economic number as positive in some fashion - no matter how bad - and in bear markets by the exact opposite." Germany's DAX index was up 0.2 percent, the UK's FTSE 100 index up 0.4 percent and France's CAC 40 up 0.2 perce
