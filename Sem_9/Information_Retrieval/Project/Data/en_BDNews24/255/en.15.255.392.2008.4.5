 HARARE (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Zimbabwean opposition's legal bid to force release of presidential election results was postponed to Sunday after armed police prevented its lawyers entering the High Court on Saturday. "The case has been postponed until 12 noon tomorrow," Movement for Democratic Change lawyer Andrew Makoni told Reuters. He said the electoral commission had asked for more time to file opposing papers. Earlier police prevented Makoni and another opposition lawyer from entering the High Court building.
