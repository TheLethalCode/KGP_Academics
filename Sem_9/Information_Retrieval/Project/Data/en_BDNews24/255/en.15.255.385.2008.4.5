<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 5 (bdnews24.com) - Educationists at a roundtable urged the caretaker government Saturday not to rush the proposed new SSC grade system, saying "a good thing should not be hastily implemented". Though they unanimously voiced support for the proposed new structured question system, they suggested holding a national dialogue before putting it into effect, and many suggested that it should be applied at schools from Grade XI. Professor Muzaffer Ahmad, chairman of Transparency International Bangladesh, asked the government to stay the decision of launching the new system as planned in 2010. "The decision should be taken after holding a national dialogue on it," he said at a roundtable on the proposed structured question system. He also called on parents and guardians to press for overall development of the education system, rather than confining changes to just one part. Former Dhaka University vice chancellor Prof Emajuddin Ahamed said the decision of introducing the system in 2010 was not a sound one. "The caretaker government does not need to look at this matter. Let an elected government come to power. They will do it," Ahamed said. Dr Kazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmad, president of the Bangladesh Economic Association, said a good thing should not be hastily implemented. "The decision of launching the system from 2010 must be stopped. A dialogue would determine which grade it should be applicable from." Dr Akhtaruzzaman of Dhaka University suggested a certain quarter wanted to rush the government in launching the new grade system to amass money. President of the Guardians Forum advocate Abed Raza, among others, felt the newly structured system should be launched from Grade XI. bdnews
