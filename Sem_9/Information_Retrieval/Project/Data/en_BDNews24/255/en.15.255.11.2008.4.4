 Dhaka, April 4 (bdnews24.com) - Workers Party president Rashed Khan Menon said Friday that the people would not accept unfair polls under the interim administration. "People are sceptical about a peaceful election. They would not accept a skewed election," Menon said at a meeting of the party's Dhaka city unit. He said the Election Commission had repeatedly argued that the election would be held in line with its roadmap but members of a special agency started looking for "prospective candidates" of their choice. "How can the election be fair?" he said, asking the government to change its alleged strategy of handpicking candidates for the polls. Menon asked the government and the Election Commission to complete election laws reforms. The main election office was meant to finalise the laws in discussion with all political parties by the end of March, but failure to hold dialogue with the BNP stalled the process. Menon criticised the government for soaring prices of daily commodities and said the administration's inefficiency fuelled the crisis. He warned the government of people's "upsurge" in the wake of rising food costs. "A grenade of hunger may explode if the prices cannot be controlled," he said metaphorically. bdnews24
