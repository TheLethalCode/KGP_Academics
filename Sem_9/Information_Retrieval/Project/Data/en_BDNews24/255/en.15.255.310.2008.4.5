<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 5 (bdnews24.com)  A four-day deputy commissioners' conference kicked off Saturday morning at the Chief Adviser's Office. Fakhruddin Ahmed inaugurated the programme, in which the current food crisis, soaring prices of daily commodities and law and order are expected to top the agenda. Many of the issues tied to the professional needs of the district administrators are also expected to come up at the conference, a senior official with the Cabinet Division said. The deputy commissioners will present the problems, challenges and obstacles facing them in a total of 19 sessions over the four days. A report, prepared by the district administrators and available with the Cabinet Division, laid out a number of recommendations to deal with the crises the country is confronting. The report submitted to the Cabinet Division said that most of the recommendations made at an earlier conference had not been implemented. Cabinet Division officials said the DCs had proposed introducing rationing on a limited scale under government management. They had also identified 184 problems to control overall the law and order situation. The conference will discuss the implementation of the 40 recommendations submitted in the earlier conference, held in June last year, as most of them have not seen any execution yet. bdnews24.com/mk/
