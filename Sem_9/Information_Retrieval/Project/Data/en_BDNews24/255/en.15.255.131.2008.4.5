 Ouagadougou, April 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Burkina Faso has extended the suspension of customs duties on staple goods by three months and cut electricity and water costs with the aim of averting a general strike over the high cost of living. Unions have called the two-day strike for April 8 to protest at a sharp rise in the cost of living in the landlocked, West African country. Following riots in several cities over the cost of basic foodstuffs in February, President Blaise Compaore's government had already announced a three-month suspension of tariffs on basic foodstuffs. "The government has taken measures, it has given something, and it would be good if the unions suspend their strike order and sit down at the table so we can search for solutions together for the problems of the nation," said Labour Minister Jerome Bougouma late on Friday. Union leaders said, however, the strike would go ahead. "We were looking for a bit more than that," said union spokesman Laurent Ouedraogo. "On the six points of our platform, only one has been answered satisfactorially. That's the measures on water and electricity." The unions are demanding a 25 percent increase in salaries and pensions backdated to January 2001. Countries across impoverished West Africa, from Senegal to Cameroon, have witnessed protests over high food prices in recent months, prompting several governments to cut import duties with the blessing of the International Monetary Fund. The cuts, however, have raised questions over the sustainability of government finances if the crisis continues. Cameroon announced late last month it was suspending the purchase of government vehicles and cutting official travel abroad to help make up the shortfall.
