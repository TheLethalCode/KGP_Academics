 Dhaka, April 04 (bdnews24.com)Foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury Thursday assured the European Union that the caretaker government would hold parliamentary polls by December. The adviser gave the assurance when he met members of a group of the EU Parliament in Brussels. Iftekhar is now on a two-day visit to Brussels on his way to Bangladesh after his trip to the US. "The foreign adviser gave an overview of the reform activities of the caretaker government as well as preparation for the elections to be held by December 2008," said a statement issued Friday by the Bangladesh mission in Brussels. The South Asia delegation of the European Parliament and the group of "Friends of Bangladesh in the European Parliament" were present at the meeting. The group was led by its two co-chairs Robert Evans and Nirj Deva. Bangladesh envoy in Brussels AHM Moniruzzaman was present at the meeting. "The people of Bangladesh are essentially pluralist and democratic in nature and they wish to see a sustainable and healthy democracy in place following the elections. They also desire that there should be no return to the situations prevailing prior to 1/11," the statement quoted the foreign adviser as saying. "The government will soon start a process of dialogue with the political parties towards that end." Iftekhar will meet Dr Benita Ferrero-Waldner, EU Commissioner for External Relations and also the President of the European Parliament Hans-Gert Pottering. bdn
