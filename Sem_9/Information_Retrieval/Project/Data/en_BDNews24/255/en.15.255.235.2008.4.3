 Dhaka, April 3 (bdnews24.com) - Kutubuddin Ahmed has been elected as the new secretary general of the Bangladesh Olympic Association, defeating Golam Kuddus Chowdhury Babu at the National Sports Council Thursday. Ahmed bagged 49 votes while Babu received 24 votes after election commissioner Brig Gen Shawkat Hossain cancelled one out of 74 votes cast. KU Aksir from Dhaka (65), Lily Aziz from Chittagong (50) and Asaduzzaman Khasru from Barisal (43) were elected as general members from the divisions leaving behind Mahmud Jamal from Rajshahi (37). The BOA election Thursday saw only six candidates compete for four posts -- the secretary general and three member posts -- as the election commissioner earlier declared 29 candidates as unopposed winners for the posts of president, five vice-presidents, three deputy secretary generals, treasurer and 19 members. After being elected, Ahmed vowed to continue the ongoing training programmes and to bring a greater degree of professionalism to the BOA during the four year term of the newly elected body. He also vowed to hold the Bangladesh Games in December this year. "We need to be more professional. We have already taken steps towards this and hope to continue doing so in future," said Ahmed. "We have a plan to amend the BOA constitution and we have already made a draft constitution during my previous tenure," said Ahmed, who ran the expired executive committee for three years as acting secretary general after the death of secretary general Jafar Iman in 2004. The last BOA election was held in February, 2001. "I accepted the defeat and took it sportingly, and I lost nothing," said Babu, adding that he was always ready to work with the newly elected body if they required him. Asked whether there was any influence of money or muscle over the voting, the losing candidate replied he knew nothing about any such influence. Of the 37-member executive committee, two more general members -- one from the national federations and one from among Olympic athletes -- will be chosen in a by-election. Another two general member posts -- one from International Olympic Committee members and one from the National Women's Association -- will remain vacant for the stint. bd
