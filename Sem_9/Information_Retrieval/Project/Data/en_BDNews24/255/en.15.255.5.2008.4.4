<TEXT>
 KARACHI, April 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar filed an appeal with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Friday against the five-year ban imposed on him for six counts of indiscipline. "I have filed my appeal and followed the procedures of the board. I have respect for the law and the board rules and the Chairman," Shoaib told reporters at the Gaddafi stadium in Lahore. The PCB's chief operating officer Shafqat Naghmi told a press conference in Lahore that an appellate tribunal would be formed soon to hear the appeal. "The tribunal will reach a decision based on facts not because of any politics," he said. Shoaib's lawyer, Azeem Danyal, said the ban was illegal and unconstitutional and they were confident of having it removed. "We have asked the board to give us a copy of the detailed judgement of the disciplinary committee by Monday after which we can prepare our case," he said. Naghmi said once the copy was given to Shoaib's lawyers, the seven-day period to begin the appeal proceedings would start. He insisted the ban was imposed after much discussion by the disciplinary committee and there was nothing personal against the fast bowler. "All the procedures of the board constitution were followed properly. Shoaib was given a fair chance to defend himself." He also denied that the board had been told by the Prime Minister to review the ban. "No one from the government has given us any instructions on this issue," he added. PCB chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf told reporters in Karachi on Friday that although the constitution allowed him to head the tribunal he was disqualifying himself from the post. "The appellate tribunal now has 30 days to hear and reach a decision on the appeal. But sadly since this issue has been politicised, they could do it faster," he said. Ashraf said the tribunal's decision would be final and binding on Shoaib as the constitution did not allow any further appeal
