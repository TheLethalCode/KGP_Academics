 Sochi, Russia, April 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States and Russia would like to create a missile shield in which they would be equal partners, U.S. President George W. Bush said on Sunday after a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Bush said Washington also supports Russia's efforts to join the World Trade Organisation. The U.S. President said he favoured dropping the Jackson-Vanik Cold War provision tying trade with Russia to human rights. The two men discussed missile defence, and want a system "in which the United States and Russia will participate as equal partners," Bush told a news conference after the talks.
