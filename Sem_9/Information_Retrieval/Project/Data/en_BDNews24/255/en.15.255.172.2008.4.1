<TITLE> Nepal eases Everest climbing ban during Olympic relay </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Kathmandu, April 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nepal has relaxed a restriction on climbing Mount Everest that was announced last month to prevent protests by Tibetans during the Olympic torch run, a senior government official said on Tuesday. The government said last month that climbers would not be allowed to go above the base camp of Mount Everest between May 1 and 10, a move mountaineers said could ruin the chances of expeditions reaching the summit. The restriction was introduced so that protesters couldn't climb the peak from the Nepal side and spoil the Torch's run when it is carried to the 8,850 metre (29,035 feet) summit in early May. China has already closed the route to the summit from Tibet. But now climbers will be allowed to go up to camp two in early May so that they can better prepare their ascent to the summit later in May. Hundreds of Tibetans in Nepal have been detained and later freed for anti-China protests in the country since mid-March. A receiver of Chinese aid, Nepal considers Tibet as part of China. Authorities were forced to relax the restriction after Nepali trekking groups complained the closure would ruin mountaineering in the tourism-dependent country and deprive thousands of sherpa guides and porters hired by expedition teams of their livelihoods. "There will be no restriction on climbers to go up to camp two," a senior tourism ministry official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters. "But climbers will not be allowed to climb above camp two until May 10 when the Olympic torch is expected to be carried to the top," he said adding that the arrangement would not hamper plans by any expedition. Camp two is normally set up at around 6,500 metres (21,325 feet) above the sea level, which is after crossing the treacherous Khumbhu Icefall. Some 30 expeditions are expected to attempt to climb the mountain during the popular climbing season that ends in May. Nine of them have already taken permits and left for the mountain, officials said. One official said army personnel would accompany expedition teams as liaison officers and would try and make sure that no climber goes above the stipulated height before May 10. He said if the torch was carried to the top before May 10, climbers could begin their ascent earlier.
