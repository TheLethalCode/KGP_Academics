<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 6 (bdnews24.com)  Agriculture adviser CS Karim asked deputy commissioners on Sunday to make a list of "real farmers" immediately to distribute subsidies among them. The adviser spelled out the directive on the second day of a three-day deputy commissioners' conference at the Chief Adviser's Office, as the government is set to start the distribution of Tk 750 crore in subsidies among farmers on April 20. "The government has arranged loans with small interests for farm development, but many are unaware of the soft loans," he said. CS Karim asked the district administrators to launch a campaign to make the farmers aware of the arrangement. Rajshahi divisional commissioner Hafizur Rahman Bhuiyan said the farmers were not getting loans properly due to "irregularities and corruption" at the field level. "The government should take measures to end the problems," Bhuiyan said. The divisional commissioner stressed farming of more fruits in hilly regions for exports abroad. Sylhet divisional commissioner Aziz Hassan told the conference that the tenders invited for development projects had run into irregularities. "Again, those who have been awarded jobs cannot work properly because of the rising prices of construction materials," he said. Aziz urged the government to take measures to stop the entry of low-quality seeds from across the border. The conference of DCs, which was cut short to three days from four, began Saturday to find ways to solve a series of problems facing the district administrators. The food crisis, soaring prices of daily commodities and law and order topped the agenda. bdnews24
