 BRUSSELS, April 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Belgian police raided suspected offices of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) on Friday, arrested about 40 women believed to have attended a training camp and seized documents, broadcaster RTL said. The report, which cited anonymous sources, showed police entering a Kurdish cultural centre in the eastern town of Verviers. A spokeswoman for Belgium's federal prosecutors office was unavailable to comment. The PKK is on the European Union's list of terrorist organisations and is blamed by the Turkish government for 40,000 deaths since it launched an armed struggle for a Kurdish homeland in southeast Turkey in 1984.
