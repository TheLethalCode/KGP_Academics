 NEW DELHI, April 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian officials met on Thursday to review security for the country's leg of the Olympic torch relay after China's foreign minister called his Indian counterpart to seek assurances. The torch's passage is a potential magnet for anti-Chinese protests by Tibetan exiles and their supporters who have staged demonstrations outside China's embassy in New Delhi and in their adopted home town of Dharamsala following unrest in Lhasa.

In Nepal, China's ambassador Zheng Xianglin urged Kathmandu to take tougher action against exiled Tibetans who he said were staging almost daily protests with "no ideas about the truth" of events in Tibet. On Thursday, Tibetan protest groups in Nepal said they had called off demonstrations until elections were over in the Himalayan state next week. Nepali police have used force to break up demonstrations and have detained hundreds of Tibetan refugees, later freeing them. Like India, Nepal considers Tibet as part of China and does not allow refugees to organise political activities against Beijing, a key donor to the Himalayan nati
