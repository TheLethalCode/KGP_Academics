<TITLE> Hungary's Free Democrats to vote against health bill </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BUDAPEST, April 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hungary's junior coalition partner said on Saturday it would vote against a key health insurance law amendment proposed by the ruling Socialists, making it unlikely the legislation will be passed. The Free Democrats, who hold 20 seats in Hungary's 386-seat parliament, announced earlier this week they would quit the ruling coalition on April 30 over the health reforms. Their decision to vote "no" to the bill, announced by party official Gabor Horn, could give the Socialists a first taste of the difficulties they could face as a minority government. With only 190 seats in parliament, the Socialists will find it harder to push through legislation and implement policies. The Free Democrats had previously said that they would not back the proposal to modify the health insurance law because they could not accept a system without private investors, as proposed by the Socialists. But they had not said whether they would actively vote against it, abstain or stay away from the vote. Since the required majority is measured by the number of voting parliamentarians, the Free Democrats' absence would have made it easier for the bill to pass. The Free Democrats decided to leave the government after Socialist Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany sacked the health minister, a Free Democrat, and the two parties disagreed over structural reforms. But Horn said his party did not favour early elections, because it would play into the hands of the popular right-of-centre opposition party Fidesz. Polls show Fidesz would win two-thirds majority in parliament if elections were held now. The next parliamentary election is due in 2010. Jozsef Gulyas, a top official in the Free Democrats, said party delegates would formally vote on quitting the government on April 27.
