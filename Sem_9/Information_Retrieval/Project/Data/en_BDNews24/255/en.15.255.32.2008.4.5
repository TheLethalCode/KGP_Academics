 BAIKONUR, Kazakhstan, April 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Preparations for the launch of a Russian rocket due to take South Korea's first astronaut into space next week entered their final stage on Saturday as technicians assembled the spaceship. "Everything is going according to plan, everything is fine," said Oleg Urusov, a spokesman for Russia's Federal Space Centre. "The rocket is due to be moved to the launch pad tomorrow morning." The Soviet-designed Soyuz TMA-12 spacecraft will blast off from Russia's Baikonur cosmodrome on the Kazakh steppe on Tuesday at 17:16 pm (1116 GMT). The rocket, originally designed during the Cold War as a ballistic missile, will carry South Korean nanotechnology engineer Yi So-yeon and Russian cosmonauts Sergei Volkov and Oleg Kononenko. Technicians were putting together different modules of the spacecraft on Saturday in a large hangar. It is due to dock with the International Space Station on Thursday. A railroad carriage stood nearby, ready to take the assembled rocket to the launch pad in the middle of the Kazakh steppe after a thorough inspection. The crew, due to take off from "Gagarin's Start" from which the first man flew into space in April 1961, received landing instructions from Russian rescue and recovery officers on the same day. Yi, 29, looked calm and focused as she took notes during a training session devoted to landing procedures. None of the crew members were available to speak to the press. South Korea's Government has paid Russia $25 million for the right to send a Korean into space. Yi is due to return to Earth on April 19.
