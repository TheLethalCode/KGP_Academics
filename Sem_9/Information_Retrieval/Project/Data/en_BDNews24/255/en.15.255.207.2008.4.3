<TITLE> Vote panic, Alitalia show Italy's talent for chaos </TITLE>

 ROME, April 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Italy is living up to its image as a country with a talent for chaos, having a last-minute legal panic over whether it can hold an election in 10 days' time and rejecting the French rescue of loss-making airline Alitalia. Throw in a mozzarella health scare and a politician called Pizza and you get the perfect ingredients for an Italian cliche -- though many Italians fail to see the funny side. A glance at the front pages of the newspapers on Thursday summed up the atmosphere ahead of the vote scheduled for April 13-14, which narrowly escaped postponement over a legal wrangle involving a tiny centrist party allied to Silvio Berlusconi. "Air France walks out, Alitalia in chaos" and "Vote: risk of new delay", read the front of top-selling Corriere della Sera -- alongside pictures of a candidate pelted with eggs and a general standing for the Senate saying gays are "not apt" for the army. The chaos finally spiced up an unusually dull campaign, in which conservative ex-prime minister Silvio Berlusconi has refrained from outrageous quips and made worthy promises similar to his centre-left rival, Rome's ex-mayor Walter Veltroni. For a nerve-racking day, Italy feared the election would be postponed over a challenge by the tiny Christian Democrat party -- led by Giuseppe Pizza and banned from competing because its logo was identical to the larger Union of Christian Democrats. After right and left protested, Pizza withdrew his challenge out of "a sense of state", averting what Communist candidate Fausto Bertinotti -- a distant third in polls -- termed a "disaster" that would make Italy "lose all credibility". MORALE LOW The year began with the centre-left government of Romano Prodi collapsing after 20 months in office after the defection of a minister and party leader over his wife's arrest. An early election was called. The campaign waned as Berlusconi, the 71-year-old owner of soccer club AC Milan, kept a 5-9 percentage point lead over 52-year-old Veltroni in opinion polls and they both made similar promises about tax cuts and being tough on crime. Interest has focused on whether the likelihood of a tie or very close result in the upper house would prompt them to form a "Grand Coalition" for long enough to change voting rules to push Italy towards a two-party system, then hold another election. Unsure in such circumstances of whether their vote will count, in a country that has already seen 61 governments come and go since World War Two, an estimated 30 percent of Italian voters are still undecided. "Politics takes a back seat, especially for business people like us," said Milan cafe-owner Daniela Maggio, 27. Accusing politicians of "destroying us" with taxes, she intends to vote for Berlusconi in the belief that he is more business-friendly. Whoever wins the election faces the urgent task of tackling a looming recession in the euro zone's third biggest economy and repairing national pride, hurt last week when one of Italy's top culinary exports -- buffalo-milk mozzarella cheese -- was briefly banned in some countries in a scare over toxic dioxi
