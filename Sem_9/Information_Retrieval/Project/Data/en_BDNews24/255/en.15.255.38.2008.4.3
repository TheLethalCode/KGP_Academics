<TITLE> Liverpool-Arsenal tie on a knife-edge after 1-1 draw </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, April 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Liverpool may have emerged from Arsenal with a 1-1 draw from Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final first leg but their coach Rafa Benitez rejects the notion they are favourites to advance to the semi-finals. Benitez was delighted by his team's outstanding defending at the Emirates Stadium but insisted after the match the tie was far from over. Although they now have the advantage of playing the second leg in front of their own fans at Anfield, Benitez said: "I do not think we are the favourites. Not against a team like Arsenal. "They are a fantastic team who have the ability to hit us on the break -- they are a superb counter-attacking team. But we will be playing at Anfield in front of our own fans and that will make a big difference." Arsenal also play Liverpool again on Saturday at the Emirates Stadium in the Premier League but Benitez says that game will have little bearing on what happens next Tuesday at Anfield. "It will make no difference at all to what happens next Tuesday," he said. Liverpool, last season's beaten finalists, were under pressure for much of the match on Wednesday but, apart from one serious lapse when Emmanuel Adebayor was left unmarked to head Arsenal in front after 23 minutes, they were disciplined and resolute in defence. Despite having much of the possession Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said his side were restricted to just four or five scoring chances. MORE DANGEROUS But he also knows that Arsenal have the potential to score in any match and can be even more dangerous away from home. "It will be a big test now for us in the second leg, but we have the desire to do it," he said. Arsenal proved in the last round that failing to win at home is not necessarily the worst thing that can happen. After being held 0-0 by AC Milan at the Emirates in the first leg of the Round of 16 on Feb. 20, they won 2-0 at the San Siro two weeks later to depose the champions and go through. Liverpool's goal game just three minutes after Arsenal's opener when Steven Gerrard surged his way past three defenders on the left and crossed for Dirk Kuyt to equalise. Wenger praised Gerrard's contribution but was not so complimentary about Dutch referee Pieter Vink, who he said should have awarded his side a penalty in the second half after Kuyt hauled down Alexander Hleb. "It happened five yards in front of the referee," said Wenger, "It was a 100 percent penalty." Arsenal's main injury worry for next week concerns Robin van Persie, who was taken off at halftime with a muscular problem. European nights at Anfield have an atmosphere of their own and although Liverpool now have a good chance of reaching the last four, the tie is still on a knife-edge, Arsenal confident they can also qualify and face either Chelsea or Fenerbahce in the semi-finals
