 KHARTOUM, April 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sudan's northern army escalated its build-up in Abyei town, the capital of an oil-rich state disputed by Sudan's north and south, with some 600 troops entering the town centre, southern officials said on Friday. Despite a north-south peace deal in 2005 which ended Africa's longest civil war, central Abyei has remained without any government or official status after the northern National Congress Party (NCP) rejected the borders outlined by an independent commission. About 200 northern soldiers rode into Abyei's capital on Wednesday setting up barracks in a school in the town centre. "There are now about 600 men in (Abyei) town," James Hoth, a senior member of the southern army, told Reuters. He said another full battalion with six tanks had set up camp eight miles north of Abyei. "There are 1,400 men altogether," Hoth said. The northern Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) spokesman declined to comment on Friday but defence minister, Abdel Rahim Mohamed Hussein, was quoted in local papers on Thursday as denying any troops had entered the town. The build up follows the appointment by the former south Sudanese rebel Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) of an administrator, Edward Lino, to the disputed state without the agreement of the NCP. Lino is often referred to as the governor of the state by those living there, which angers the NCP. Under the 2005 north-south peace deal, Abyei has the right along with the rest of the south to vote in a 2011 referendum on secession from the north. The deal also gives the semi-autonomous southern government 50 percent of oil revenues from wells within the south. South Sudanese officials who claim Abyei is in the south say at least $1 billion in oil revenues has been taken illegally by the NCP. Lino told Reuters from Abyei that SAF and the powerful northern national security were refusing any of his attempts to begin dialogue. "Their intention is to frighten the people of the town to desert the town and we are not prepared to desert Abyei," he said. It's a situation that can explode ...at any time anywhere in the town," Lino added.
