<TITLE> Cameroon proposes scrapping presidential term limit </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Yaounde, April 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cameroon's government has presented a constitutional reform to parliament to remove term limits for President Paul Biya, who has ruled the central African country for over 25 years, state radio said on Friday. Popular discontent over the plans to extend Biya's rule when his current seven-year term expires in 2011 was one of the causes of rioting in Cameroon this year which left some 100 people dead, according to civil rights campaigners. Biya had confirmed his intention to stand again in an end-of-year speech, citing popular calls for him to stay in power and saying the term limit was undemocratic. He revised the constitution in 1996 -- after 14 years in office -- to extend the presidential term from five to seven years and make it renewable only once. He won the first seven-year term in 1997 and was re-elected in 2004, and is currently barred from running again in 2011. Biya's rule has been marred by human rights abuses and Cameroon's reputation as one of the most corrupt countries in the world, particularly in the late 1990s. In recent years, some ministers and senior officials have been jailed for graft. Cameroon's parliament is overwhelmingly controlled by the ruling Cameroon People's Democratic Movement. Legislators in Nigeria, Zambia and Malawi have blocked efforts to allow third terms for presidents in recent years.
