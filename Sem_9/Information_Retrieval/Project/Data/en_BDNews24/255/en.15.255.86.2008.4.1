 Kuala Lampur, April 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Malaysia's opposition parties agreed on Tuesday to form a coalition in an effort to present themselves as a credible alternative for government, while the main ruling party sank deeper into dissent. The three main opposition parties won a record number of seats in parliament at elections on March 8, dealing the ruling National Front coalition the biggest setback in its 50-year reign and spelling trouble for the prime minister's future leadership. "In today's meeting, it was proposed to consolidate the cooperation among the three parties under the name Pakatan Rakyat (People's Pact)," de facto opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim told reporters after a meeting with fellow party leaders. Malaysia's opposition has been weak and ideologically divided for many years, comprising two parties that appeal mainly to urban, liberal voters and an Islamist outfit that attracts mainly rural votes and wants to turn Malaysia into an Islamic state. The three parties tried once before to form a coalition with a single policy platform, during an election campaign in 1999. But the pact fell apart two years later over the issue of Parti se-Malaysia's (PAS's) call for the creation of an Islamic state. Anwar, a former deputy premier, said the parties were still working on a common policy platform on Tuesday. But he insisted PAS's stand on an Islamic state would not sink the new alliance, which also includes his Parti Keadilan Rakyat (People's Justice Party) and the Democratic Action Party. "It is not an issue as far as we are concerned," he said. As Anwar sought to present an ideologically united opposition, the main ruling party was in open revolt, with hundreds of supporters meeting at a Kuala Lumpur hotel on Tuesday to demand Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi's resignation. More than 500 people, members of Abdullah's United Malays National Organisation, cheered as former premier Mahathir Mohamad and his son, elected MP Mukhriz Mahathir, called for Abdullah's leadership to be challenged to save the party. "UMNO risks becoming no longer relevant because there are now more "yes men" than those who are willing to give dissenting views," said Mahathir, 82, who was himself intolerant of dissent during his 22 years in power until retiring in late 2003. "We must look at ourselves and be brave and take action to correct UMNO."
