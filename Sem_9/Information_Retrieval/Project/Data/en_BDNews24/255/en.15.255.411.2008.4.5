 KINSHASA, April 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least seven people died and another 24 were missing after an overloaded canoe capsized in Democratic Republic of Congo, U.N. radio reported on Saturday. Six other passengers swam to shore and survived after the wooden dugout overturned on the Lubilanji River some 45 km (28 miles) south of Mbuji Mayi, the capital of central Eastern Kasai province, on Thursday, U.N.-sponsored Radio Okapi said. The boat was built to carry about 25 people, witnesses said. Ten people died and several others were injured in a road accident in Bandundu province on Saturday morning. Police said the driver of a truck was speeding and used poor judgment.
