<TITLE> UBS in new capital hike after huge Q1 losses </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Zurich, April 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UBS AG wrote down an additional $19 billion in assets on Tuesday, causing a net loss of 12 billion Swiss francs ($12.03 billion) in the first quarter, and said it would seek 15 billion francs in new capital through a rights issue. The moves, though widely expected, deal a new blow to the world's largest wealth manager and the European bank hardest hit so far by the credit crisis. The bank's chairman, Marcel Ospel, would not seek re-election, UBS said in a statement. UBS said it would create a new division to deal with the ailing assets after its mortgage-related positions deteriorated further in the quarter. The writedowns come on top of $18.4 billion in damage caused by the subprime crisis last year, which already forced the bank to ask shareholder approval for 19 billion francs in capital raising measures in February.
