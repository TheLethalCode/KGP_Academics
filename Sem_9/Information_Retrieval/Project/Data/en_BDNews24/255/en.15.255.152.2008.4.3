<TEXT>
 ZAGREB, April 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A fugitive former Croatian general, suspected of killing four people last week, committed suicide on Thursday after police besieged his hideout. One policeman was shot dead as special police troops tried to capture Ivan Korade, a senior Croatian commander during the bloody breakup of the former Yugoslavia from 1991-95. "Korade killed himself at his estate where he had been hiding," said police chief Marijan Benko. No further details were immediately available. An extensive manhunt was launched after police found four bodies in three separate locations in Korade's native Zagorje region in the north of Croatia. Korade, who was a central heating fitter before the 1990s, lost his left arm in the war and was retired in 1997. Some 500 policemen, including special units, backed by helicopters had combed forests around Korade's village for a week and alerted colleagues in neighbouring Slovenia. The whole country followed news of the manhunt. Violent incidents have been relatively rare in Croatia since its war of independence ended in 1995.
