<TEXT>
 ROME, March 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England coach Fabio Capello told a court on Monday he never dealt with player contracts while in Italy and never heard of players being put under pressure to sign specific agreements. Capello was a witness in the trial of six men accused of fostering unfair competition through the use of threats or violence as part of the Gea World sports agency, which used to manage the careers of several Italian footballers and coaches. Former Juventus general manager Luciano Moggi, also at the centre of Italy's 2006 match-fixing affair, and Davide Lippi, son of former Italy coach Marcello, are among the defendants. Capello worked under Moggi at Juventus from 2004-2006 but it was his time in charge of Roma between 1999 and 2004 which most interested the court. "I have never heard about players being put under pressure or of incidents relating to the players' contracts," Capello said during over an hour's testimony. "At Roma and then at Juventus when I was boss, I only dealt with coaching decisions." Asked about an interview he gave to newspaper Corriere dello Sport about Gea and their potential monopoly of players, Capello said: "I did that interview because I thought it was right to do something for Roma. I knew about Gea, I knew that many players were gravitating towards that company." Franco Baldini, Capello's assistant with England and former sporting director at Roma, gave evidence earlier. Moggi had to be warned by the judge after gesturing towards Baldini while he was on the stand. Marcello Lippi, who steered Italy to their 2006 World Cup triumph, is likely to appear as a witness on Tuesday. Juventus's France forward David Trezeguet gave testimony at the trial last month with several other leading Italian football personalities set to give evidence
