<TITLE> Shares, dollar tread water as US jobs data looms </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 HONG KONG, April 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian shares eased on Friday and the dollar made little headway as investors braced themselves for a US jobs report due later on Friday for a fresh reading on the state of the economy. Investors are keenly watching the US economy because its slowdown is sapping demand and weakening the dollar, a double headache for Asian exporters dependent on US sales. Financial bookmakers expect Britain's FTSE 100 index to open as much as 0.3 percent higher and the German DAX to open as much as 0.5 percent higher. The French CAC 40 is expected to open around 0.5 percent lower. The US jobs report will test the mettle of some stock market investors, who had hoped to have seen the market's bottom. Economists expect the non-farm payrolls report to show the US economy shed a total of 60,000 jobs in March and the unemployment rate rose to 5.0 percent from 4.8 percent the previous month. "The market will closely watch whether the results of the US jobs data pour cold water on the market optimism or not," said Hideaki Inoue, chief manager of forex trading at Mitsubishi UFJ Trust Banking. Share prices have gyrated this year as jittery traders flipped from seeing a doomsday scenario in one session to hoovering up cheap stocks in the next. The latest major surge came this week after global banks were seen to have drawn a line under the worst of the credit crisis, but even the Federal Reserve now sees a possibility of recession. "Economic prospects remain unusually uncertain, and the downside risks to growth are significant," San Francisco Federal Reserve President Janet Yellen said in remarks prepared for an outlook presentation to the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. "It appears that growth in consumption and business investment spending has slowed markedly after years of robust performance, and, as a result, the economy has all but stalled and could contract over the first half of the year." CAUTION Asian stock markets traded cautiously, although China, Taiwan and Hong Kong were all observing the Tomb Sweeping Day holiday. Japan's Nikkei average closed 0.7 percent lower, as investors sold to take advantage of a more than 12 percent rebound since March 17, when the index hit its lowest point since August 2005. Stock elsewhere in Asia, as measured by MSCI's index were flat at 0634 GMT, hovering at a one month high. Sydney's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index rose 0.2 percent to a fresh five-week high as miners such as BHP Billiton Ltd rose on stronger metals prices, while QBE Insurance Group Ltd gained on an upbeat outlook. But caution was the watchword as many investors took profits. "Indeed, there have recently been signs of improvement for the U.S. share market and financial system. But the U.S. economy clearly won't turn on a dime," said Craig James, chief equities economist at CommSec. The dollar, which climbed to a three-week high of 102.95 yen on Thursday on electronic trading platform EBS, slunk back below 102.5 yen. The euro also strengthened and found support around $1.567. Gold traditionally a refuge for investors worried about turbulence in stocks, trickled back towards $900, giving up the $5 it gained on Thursday to track a rally in platinum which rose on worries about supply problems. Copper and other metals traded thinly without Chinese buyers, but here too, the market was glued to the jobs report. "There's going to be a lot of wait and see prior to the data. Obviously, weaker data will certainly exacerbate what is already quite a sticky situation," said Darren Heathcote of Investec Australia in Sydney. "Whilst there's potential for global growth slowing in the months ahead, I think for the time being at least, while those stocks are in short supply, we are not going to see copper prices fall, or at least fall substantially." Oil also firmed, rising 41 cents to $104.24 a barrel in Asian trade and recovering from losses in the previous session due to concerns over US oil dema
