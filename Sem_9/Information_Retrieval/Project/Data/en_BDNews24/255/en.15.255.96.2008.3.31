 GENEVA, March 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The World Trade Organisation (WTO) criticised the European Union on the one hand as well as the United States and Canada on the other on Monday in a ruling about the EU's ban on imports of hormone-treated beef. A WTO panel said that Washington and Ottawa had been wrong to unilaterally extend their sanctions on EU exports, imposed because of the ban. But it also said that EU revisions to its ban, based on new scientific evidence, were not enough to remove the other side's justification for trade retaliation. At issue was whether the United States and Canada could continue imposing millions of dollars of trade sanctions on EU exports after Brussels revised its ban in 2003, citing stronger scientific evidence that hormone-treated beef endangered health. The mixed ruling seems unlikely to end a 12-year-old dispute that has marred trade relations across the Atlantic. Both sides immediately claimed victory. U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab said the EU ban was "scientifically unjustified". "It is high time for the EU to come into compliance with its obligations," she said in a statement. But the EU's executive commission said the WTO had condemned the U.S. and Canadian sanctions. "The EU therefore demands that the US and Canada remove their retaliatory measures," it said. Both sides have 60 days to appeal the ruling. The EU has banned the use of growth-promoting hormones and imports of meat treated with them since the mid-1980s, arguing that they risk causing cancer. But the United States and Canada challenged the ban in 1997, and in 1998 the WTO found that it was not in line with trading rules because the scientific assessment was not specific enough. As the ban remained in place, the WTO authorised the United States and Canada to impose sanctions of $116.8 million and C$11.3 million ($11.1 million) a year respectively. Since 1999 the two countries have imposed punitive 100 percent duties on European products such as Roquefort cheese, pork, cucumbers, tomatoes, truffles and musta
