<TEXT>
 LONDON, April 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World stocks began the new quarter on a positive note on Monday as revelations of huge losses at major European banks suggested that financial firms are coming clean on their woes. UBS wrote down an additional $19 billion from the US subprime mortgage crisis, causing a net loss of 12 billion Swiss francs ($12.03 billion) in the first quarter, and said it would seek 15 billion francs through a rights issue of shares. Deutsche Bank unveiled 2.5 billion euros of writedowns, equivalent to more than a third of its 2007 net profit. The eight-month-old credit crisis has hit the world's major banks and threatened to damage corporate profits and derail global economic growth. However, as more banks reveal the extent of the damage, investors believe they can see the light at the end of the tunnel. Liquidity injections by the world's major central banks have also helped to ease strains in the money markets, and this has also calmed investor nerves. "The one saving grace in this is that banks are acting quickly to highlight their exposure. The quicker the bad news is out in the open then the quicker we can start to repair the problems," said Peter Dixon, economist at Commerzbank. "Every bank which comes out with a big number nudges us that much closer to the end of the write-off cycle." The FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 1 percent, while MSCI main world equity index was up nearly 0.1 percent on the day, having lost nearly 10 percent since the start of the year. UBS shares rose more than six percent, fooling many who had thought before the market open that the shares would sink. "They've separated all their toxic waste. If they're going to finance that then everyone is saying this is the beginning of the end, this is the last capital increase," a London-based trader said. Tokyo stocks rose more than one percent, led by blue chip exporters. The euro was down half a percent at $1.5692, off its record high above $1.59 in March. Sentiment also improved in the credit and emerging markets. The iTraxx Crossover index, most-widely watched indicator for European credit market sentiment, tightened 3 basis points to 570 bps. Emerging sovereign spreads tightened 3 bps. Emerging stocks, however, were down 0.1 percent. The June Bund future fell 30 ticks. US light crude was down 0.8 percent while gold -- a traditional safe-haven asset -- fell to $892.50 an oun
