 BUCHAREST, April 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia agreed on Friday to let NATO use its land to deliver non-lethal supplies to alliance forces in Afghanistan, but not troops or air transit arrangements initially sought by NATO. The deal was showcased at a summit between alliance leaders and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Bucharest as evidence of cooperation between the former Cold War foes, even though it fell short of NATO hopes. Afghanistan was a major topic of discussion for NATO leaders on Thursday, when several countries pledged to boost their contributions to the alliance's force there. More details of their contributions emerged on Friday. "It's been done," a NATO spokeswoman said of the deal with Russia. "It will cover land transit of non-lethal equipment. Air transit is not for today." A subsequent statement issued from the meeting said an existing NATO-Russian programme on training local counter-narcotics officials would be upgraded to a more permanent arrangement. Letters implementing the agreement were exchanged by NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer and Russian Foreign Ministers Sergei Lavrov, a Kremlin spokesman said. The NATO spokeswoman said non-lethal supplies covered everything from food to certain military equipment. She did not say why troops or air transit would not be covered. De Hoop Scheffer said last month he was hopeful of increased cooperation with Russia and a NATO spokesman said then talks were taking place on land and air corridors for troops and equipment. Moscow has been irked by the alliance's eastward expansion and Friday's summit followed a promise by NATO leaders on Thursday to former Soviet republics Ukraine and Georgia that they will one day join the Western defence pact. MORE TROOPS Of the nations that announced more forces for the 47,000-strong NATO mission in Afghanistan, France offered the biggest contribution of 700 soldiers. Azerbaijan offered another 45 troops while the Czech Republic said it would provide 120 special forces soldiers in the violent south of the country, according to a source close to the discussion on Afghanistan. Italy, Romania and Greece offered teams of a few dozen troops to train units of Afghan security forces, the source said. NATO says such teams are among its most pressing requirements. Romanian Defence Minister Teodor Melescanu told reporters Romania had not taken a decision on sending additional troops during the summit. "But following France and others...Romania will show its solidarity and, from our assessment, we think we could boost our military presence in Afghanistan with 120 or 150 soldiers," he said. NATO has not yet said if the new commitments will bring the force up to the minimum requirements specified by military experts. But it appeared it would still have shortfalls. NATO officials said before the summit that the force lacked about three battalions -- between 1,500 and 3,000 troops. The force's commander, U.S. Army Gen. Dan McNeill, has suggested he would like a total of three more brigades, according to U.S. officials. A U.S. Army brigade has between 3,000 and 5,000 troops.
