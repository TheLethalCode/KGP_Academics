 MOSCOW, April 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian police detained more than 40 people on Saturday who demonstrated near the Kremlin in central Moscow after they used a wedding procession to reach the restricted area, witnesses said. They said about 50 cheering members of the far-left National Bolshevik Party distracted police guarding the area by escorting a couple on a wedding procession. Once near old Execution Place next to St. Basil's cathedral, the group stunned the police by burning signal flares, holding up placards demanding "freedom to political prisoners" and chanting: "We need another Russia!" before police attacked them. "The action lasted for about 10 or 15 minutes," said Lyudmila Mamina, spokeswoman for the Other Russia opposition movement which unites both neo-Bolsheviks and market liberals. "Then riot police arrived and threw some 40 people into buses. They were beating some of the protesters. One of the demonstrators was beaten unconscious while on the bus." Police declined to comment. The Kremlin guard service FSO, a successor to the Soviet-era KGB, said it was alarmed by the incident. "The FSO is concerned that the territory of the especially well protected historical and cultural area -- the Moscow Kremlin, which also includes Red Square -- was chosen to hold this unauthorised action," PIA news agency quoted FSO spokesman Sergei Devyatov as saying.
