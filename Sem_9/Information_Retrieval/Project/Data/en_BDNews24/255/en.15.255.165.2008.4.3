<TEXT>
 BUCHAREST, April 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko called a NATO pledge on Thursday to welcome it into the alliance a historic victory for the former Soviet country. "This decision is historic," Yushchenko told a news conference at a NATO summit, even though alliance leaders earlier rejected its request for a formal plan on membership, offering a vaguer promise that it would one day become a member. "This is our victory ... because with this document all the 26 allies have confirmed their decision that we agreed all today that these countries will be allies."
