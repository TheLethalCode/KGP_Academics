 Baghdad, April 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Five people were killed and 17 wounded in clashes between US soldiers and gunmen in a Shia stronghold in Baghdad on Sunday, Iraqi police said. They said the operation started in the early hours of Sunday and some fighting reached the outskirts of densely populated Sadr City, which is home to 2 million people in eastern Baghdad. The U.S. military said it was not aware of any fighting in the Sadr City district but said there were reports an air strike had killed nine "criminals". It did not give a precise location for the air strike. Sadr City is the stronghold of the Mehdi Army militia of Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. Security forces fought pitched battles with the Mehdi Army in the slum late last month. No details were available on those killed on Sunday. Iraqi police said women and children were among the wounded. They said U.S. forces had cordoned off some areas of the district, including police stations and had prevented police from using their radio communications equipment. Some police in Sadr City are accused of being sympathetic to the Mehdi Army.
