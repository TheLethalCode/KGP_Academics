<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 3 (bdnews24.com)A nongovernmental outfit, known as the War Crimes Facts-Finding Committee, Thursday published a list of 1,597 alleged war criminals, including former Jamaat-e-Islami chief Golam Azam and current ameer Motiur Rahman Nizami. Jamaat secretary general Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mujahid and assistant secretaries general Abdul Kader Mollah and Muhammad Qamaruzzaman and former MP Delwar Hossain Saidee have also been named. Dr MA Hasan, convenor of the committee, released the list from a press conference at the WVA auditorium in Dhanmondi and said information about the 'war criminals' had been collected over the last nine years. Of the 1597 on the list, 369 are Pakistani army officers, 852 Razakar Bhini members, 64 Al Badr Bahini members, 78 Bihari collaborators, 106 political collaborators and 128 'peace committee' members. "They had directly been involved in killings, rape and torture," Hasan alleged. At the press conference, four women tortured by the Pakistani forces in 1971 were given "token citations". They are Putul Rani Karmakar from Barguna and Romeja Kathun, Paribunnessa and Moymona Khatun from Mymensingh. In a written statement, Hasan alleged: "After the declaration of independence in 1971, those political elements who had sided with the killers and supported and taken part in genocide were members of Jamaat-e-Islami, Nezam-e-Islami, People's Democratic Party (PDP) and Muslim League." "It is also true that some MNAs of the Awami League sided with Pakistan. But Jamaat-e-Islami and its student wing Islami Chhatra Sangha were involved in genocide, torture of women and secret killings of intellectuals," he said. The list will be handed to the government, the Election Commission and international organisations for taking action against the "war criminals", Hasan said. "There is no political motive behind the publication of the list," Hasan claimed. bdnew
