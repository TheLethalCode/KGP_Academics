 Prague, April 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A leading Czech opposition party called on the government on Friday to resign if it fails to push through a plan to site a US missile defence radar in the central European country. The government lacks a parliamentary majority and some of its deputies have threatened to vote against the radar plan, which Russia sees as a threat to its security and an intrusion into its former sphere of influence. Michal Hasek, leader of the leftist Social Democrats bloc in parliament, said the government should call a confidence vote, dashing government hopes that an endorsement of the plan by NATO leaders would secure some opposition support. "The radar ratification is about confidence in the government," Hasek told Reuters. "None of the (ruling) coalition parties had the siting of a foreign military base in its election programme, and therefore they have no electoral mandate from the 2006 general elections to make such a decision," he said. U.S. and Czech officials agreed at a NATO summit on Thursday on the deployment of the first part of a planned U.S. missile shield for Europe. Washington wants to install a radar in the Czech Republic and 10 interceptor rockets in Poland to protect the United States and its allies from attack by what it calls rogue states, such as Iran or North Korea. Last month, the Social Democrat leader Jiri Paroubek ordered his deputies to vote against the plan, saying he would not run in the next election due in 2010 alongside any deputy that broke ranks and voted for the radar. The centre-right government of Mirek Topolanek has just 100 MPs in the 200-seat lower house. It has survived thanks to the votes of two independents, making the three-party ruling coalition vulnerable to internal bickering. The Green Party, a junior coalition partner along with the Christian Democrats, is split on the radar issue. It is due to hold an internal ballot on the issue in the spring.
