<TEXT>
 Pabna, March 31 (bdnews24.com)Organisers were forced to cancel a discussion meeting in Pabna, in honour of novelist and poet Shirshendu Mukhopaddhaya, as they failed to get the go-ahead in time from the police. The Kolkata-based Bengali author was scheduled to exchange views with leading personalities of Pabna town at the Annada Govinda Public Library auditorium Sunday. Pabna Satsangha general secretary Rabindranath Sarker said Shirshendu had come directly to Pabna from Kolkata at the invitation of their organisation. Jugal Chandra, organiser of the programme and treasurer of Pabna Anukul Chandra Satsangha, told bdnews24.com: "The programme in Pabna town was cancelled as the police did not give us permission to hold it." The meeting was later held at Sri Sri Thakur Anukul Chandra Ashram in Hemayetpur, on the outskirts of Pabna, he said. Jugal Chandra claimed that they had sent a letter to the deputy commissioner on Thursday seeking permission to hold the meeting, but did not receive it. Additional superintendent of police Nahid Hossain told bdnews24.com Monday: "The letter of the organisers was not received in time." "Though the letter was sent on Thursday it did not arrive until Monday, as Friday and Saturday were holidays," the police officer said. "So measures could not be taken as requested due to the delay in receipt of the letter." Deputy commissioner Khandaker Moklesur Rahman said authorities were set to give permission for the programme to go ahead, and that he sent the letter on to the police super's office as per the rules. Speaking at the discussion programme in Hemayetpur Sunday evening, Shirshendu said: "Bangalees are now afloat in Western culture." "Now, we are observing Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, and so on. In observing these Western cultural occasions, we are day by day drifting away from Bangla," the visiting author said. "Love is gradually withering away from the minds of people. So people are becoming isolated." On the self-exile of writer Taslima Nasreen, he said: "I am saddened when anybody in his or her writing attacks religion." "I hope in future good sense will prevail over her." Shirshendu said that there was nothing of feminism or idealism in Taslima's writings: "Her writings contained rage against a group, which is not expected of a responsible author." "None should practise irresponsibility in writing." bdnews24.co
