 Dhaka, April 3 (bdnews24.com) - Usha Krira Chakra signed up nine former national hockey players on the last day of the rescheduled player transfers amid shoving between Usha and Abahani Limited officials following the registration of goalkeeper Jahid Hossain. The officials of joint champions Abahani and Usha involved in shoving as Jahid picked the transfer token for Abahani this season despite committing to play for Usha. A witness said that an Usha official named Abdul Aziz tried to catch Jahid when the player was on the way to the registration room with his token, but he was soon escorted by the Abahani officials. The pushing around, however, stopped at the intervention of officials of both clubs. Usha KC general secretary Abdur Rashid Shikdar said that his club paid Taka 75,000 against the deal of 1,25,000 to Jahid on Wednesday night for this season. Abahani's last season captain Faruque, however, claimed that Abahani paid Jahid on Tuesday. Jahid admitted taking money from Usha. "Yes, I took money from Usha as the club officials had earlier said that they would not pay anyone until all 10 players, just released from the national team, played for their club," said Jahid. "To ensure nine other players' payments, I received money from Usha," said the goalkeeper, who played for Usha last season. According to the by-laws, if any player were found guilty of taking money from more than one club, the player would remain out of the league. The Bangladesh Hockey Federation (BHF), on March 31, freed 11 players from the national team as they asked the federation to release them from the national fold after failing to secure club places on the last date of the inter-club player transfer on March 25. Nine players who signed for Usha are: Mahbubullah Shakil, Shamsuddin Tuhin, Mostafizur Rahman Dinar, Tabib A Noor, Khandokar Hasan Ahmed, Shahidullah Titu, Rahul Kanti Roy, Jahidul Islam Rajon and Maksud Alam Habul. Abahani roped in Jahid Hossain.
