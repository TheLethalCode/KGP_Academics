 PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad, April 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - West Indies mopped up the Sri Lankan tail on Friday dismissing the tourists for 278 on the second day of the second test. Sri Lanka resumed on 217 for five but lost their last five wickets for just 61 runs onm Friday although Chamara Silva provided some resistance with a smart 76. Fidel Edwards finished with figures of 4-84. West Indies captain Chris Gayle then led a positive start to the reply scoring 39 of the 49 runs put on in nine overs without loss before lunch. The hosts got an early breakthrough when Tillakaratne Dilshan, who had led the Sri Lanka fightback in his century partnership with Silva during Thursday's last session, top-edged Edwards as he attempted a pull shot and keeper Denesh Ramdin comfortably took the high catch. Dilshan had made a valuable 62 to help Sri Lanka recover from 117 for five on day one. Chaminda Vaas (1) then went in similar fashion as he made a mess of trying to pull Daren Powell with Ramdin taking another easy catch and then Mirando Thushara was run out for one after a direct hit from Ramnaresh Sarwan at mid-wicket. Powell picked up his second wicket of the session when Muttiah Muralitharan's (8) wild shot flew down to third man where Dwayne Bravo took an excellent diving catch. Silva's endeavour came to an end when he hooked a bouncer from Bravo and Powell took the catch and deep square-leg. The only blemish on a fine session for the hosts was when Gayle was ordered to withdraw Taylor from his attack after he bowled a beamer at Silva -- his second of the innings. Gayle, who has struggled throughout his career against the clever left-arm swing of Vaas, led the response along with debutant Sewnarine Chattergoon. Although he was beaten by a couple of superb Vaas deliveries, Gayle was in aggressive mood and took the pressure off Chattergoon. He was fortunate though to be dropped by Muralitharan at mid-on off Amerasinghe's bowling but went in for lunch having hit eight fours. Sri Lanka lead the two-test series 1
