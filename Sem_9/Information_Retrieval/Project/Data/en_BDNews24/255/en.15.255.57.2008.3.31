 HONG KONG, March 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian shares fell on Monday, posting their worst quarterly performance in over five years, on persistent concerns about the global credit crunch and the impact of weakening US consumer demand on the region's exports. European shares were also seen falling, though by smaller amounts, as they headed towards their third consecutive quarter in the red. Prices of oil -- among the top performing asset classes so far this year -- extended falls from the previous session following the restart of a crude pipeline system in Iraq, but other record-setting commodities such as gold steadied. The dollar climbed against the yen bolstered by unexpectedly strong demand from Japanese importers and institutional investors, ending the quarter in which the greenback has sank in line with the faltering outlook for the US economy. "The debt market issue has to be resolved before we get more clarity on financial stocks and markets generally," said Greg Goodsell, equity strategist at ABN AMRO in Australia. "I suspect there are more losses to be written off there." Asian equity markets have had a tough quarter amid the prospects of a U.S. recession at a time of rising inflationary pressures, and a worsening global credit crisis that has led to billions of dollars in writedowns in the financial sector. The MSCI's measure of Asian stocks outside Japan dropped over 13 percent so far this year, marking its worst performance since the quarter ended in September 2002. The losses have contrasted sharply with the double digit gains in the index in each of the previous five year. Markets that soared in 2007 were among the most vulnerable this year, with Shanghai shares dropping over 30 percent in the first quarter alone. COMMODITIES SOARED The MSCI index fell 0.9 percent by 0630 GMT on Monday, weighed down by the same concerns over the U.S. economy and financial sector woes that have made for such a poor performance over the last three months. U.S. department store operator J.C. Penney Co Inc on Friday cut its first-quarter earnings forecast -- setting up doubts about the health of U.S. consumer demand. Worries about the health of the financial sector also continued after Oppenheimer & Co analyst Meredith Whitney said U.S. banks including Citigroup are likely to announce dividend cuts in April. Tokyo shares fell 2.3 percent, while Shanghai's benchmark index lost 1.8 percent after rumours last week that the government would announce market-friendly steps failed to materialise. Japanese trading house Marubeni Corp plunged 6.6 percent over news reports that Lehman Brothers will sue the company, saying it was defrauded of more than $355 million. Shares in Hong Kong fell 1.9 percent, while indexes in Taiwan and Singapore fell less than 1 percent. Markets South Korea and Australia ended slightly higher. OIL FALLS The quarter has also been marked by a surge in commodity prices, as demand continues to outpace supply, while a plunging U.S. dollar has made the asset classes cheaper for a wide swaths of global buyers. The need to hedge against inflation and speculative money from new funds targeting commodity prices have also been explained as factors behind the surge in prices. "We have very strong supply and demand fundamentals. It takes two, three or four years to build a mine, so you can't just turn a tap and produce more commodities," said Evy Hambro, managing director at BlackRock Merrill Lynch Investment Managers told a news conference in Singapore. "We expect commodity prices to remain at high levels," he said. "Supply-side constraints will also continue to support the price of gold and other commodities." US crude for May delivery fell 87 cents to $104.80 a barrel on Monday, extending a $2 drop seen on Friday, after Iraq restarted a crude supply pipeline system eased fears of an extended export disruption from the country's oil-rich south. Oil prices hit a record high of $111.80 in mid-March, after ending 2007 trading at around $60 a barrel. Gold was steadier at $932.90 an ounce, slightly higher from late US trade on Friday, but off a record $1,030.80 on March 17. The dollar rose against the yen in choppy trade on Monday, though many market participants were on hold for more clues about the US economy. The greenback rose some 0.6 percent to 99.70 yen from late US trade on Friday, and gained 0.2 percent against a basket of six currenci
