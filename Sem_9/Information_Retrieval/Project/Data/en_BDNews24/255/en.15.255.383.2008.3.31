 Dhaka, March 31 (bdnews24.com) -- Former Bangladesh skipper Shafique-ul Haque Heera has been appointed as the national cricket squad's operation manager on a one year contract, a BCB statement said Monday. "The board has offered me a one-year contract for the national team's operation manager and I accepted the offer," Heera told bdnews24.com following a meeting with the Bangladesh Cricket Board Monday. The contract will be effective from April 1 and Heera will accompany the national team on next month's Pakistan tour. The Tigers are scheduled to play five one-day internationals and a Twenty20 match from April 6 to 20. The board, however, earlier did not consider Heera for the post after interviewing him the first time. Heera represented Bangladesh's national team from 1976 to 1984, and captained the country throughout 1979 as well as in the ICC Trophy tournament held in England in 1982. The 62-year old former cricketer, who is also a National Sports Award winner, was the Bangladesh cricket team manager for the 1988 Asia Cup in Dhaka, the 1990 Australasia Cup in Sharjah, the home series against Pakistan in 2002 and home series against Australia in 2006. He also served the board as a deputy director in development, and venue director of the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Haque was a national selector during Bangladesh's ICC Trophy win in 1997, and was one of the representatives of the BCB at the host submission meetings of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011. bd
