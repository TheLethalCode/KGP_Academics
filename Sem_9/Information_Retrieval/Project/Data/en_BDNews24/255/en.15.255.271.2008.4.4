 AHMEDABAD, India, April 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - AB de Villiers and Jacques Kallis completed impressive centuries to help South Africa maintain a stranglehold on the second test against India on Friday. De Villiers struck 159 not out and Kallis 132 as the fifth-wicket pair built on their overnight century stand to guide the visitors to 413 for five at tea on day two, a massive first-innings lead of 337. Wicketkeeper Mark Boucher (nine) was at the crease with De Villiers at the interval. De Villiers and Kallis displayed a combination of assured footwork with soft hands against India's experienced spinners in the morning, before exerting their dominance to put the match beyond India. The pair were tested by the medium-pacers after the second new ball was taken during the 18th over of the day but the home attack looked bereft of ideas as the game progressed. The experienced Kallis and De Villiers made light work of the Indian attack in taking their stand to 256 -- the highest for any wicket for South Africa against India. Resuming at 223-4 after their pace attack had dismissed the hosts for a paltry 76 runs within a session, De Villiers reached his fifth test century with a paddle shot off part-time seamer Saurav Ganguly to the fine leg fence. Kallis chalked up his 30th test ton in the second over after lunch with am elegant cover drive to the boundary, also off Ganguly. Medium-pacer Shanthakumaran Sreesanth provided the only breakthrough of the day when he bowled the 32-year-old Kallis playing-on. All-rounder Kallis, who scored three centuries in Pakistan last year, hit 14 fours and a six in his remarkable 275-ball knock. Fluent De Villiers, who hit 16 fours, crossed the 150-run mark with a boundary off paceman Rudra Pratap Singh through covers. On Thursday, South Africa spearhead Dale Steyn finished with five wickets after Makhaya Ntini claimed three victims in 12 deliveries to rip through India's top order in bowler-friendly conditions after the hosts won the toss and opted to bat. The first test in Chennai last week ended in a high-scoring draw while the third and final test of the series in Kanpur starts on April 1
