 Dhaka, March 4 (bdnews24.com) - Reeza Hendricks Saturday hammered a stroke-filled century to help the South Africa academy team finish 295 for eight at the close of the second day of the first four-dayer at Shamsul Huda Stadium in Jessore. Reeza played a 188-ball 131, featuring 19 boundaries. After being put in to bowl first, the GP-BCB academy team got off to a fine start in the morning, but failed to keep the momentum after the first day was washed out due to rains. Pacer Nazmul Hossain bowled opener Sammy-Joe Avontuur (0) in the day's fifth delivery before Raihanuddin Arafat had another opener Rushdi Jappie (21) caught by skipper Nasiruddin Faruque to reduce the visitors to 55 for two inside 19 overs. But one-down Reeza, pairing with his skipper Dane Villas, defied the attack to take their side to 115 in the 29th over before the latter was bowled by Nazmul, who finally returned three for 51. Reeza then contributed another 106-run partnership with Shadley van Schlkwyk (54) before he was Nazmul's third victim, leaving the side at 221 for five. After the departure of Reeza, the Bangladesh bowlers picked up three quick wickets for 41 runs to reduce the visitors to 262 for eight. CJ de Villiers and Neil Wagner resume the third day Sunday with unbeaten 21 and 16 respectively. Raihanuddin took two for 66 while Mehrab Hossain Junior and Suhrawardi Shuvo grabbed one wicket each for 53 and 76 respectively. bd
