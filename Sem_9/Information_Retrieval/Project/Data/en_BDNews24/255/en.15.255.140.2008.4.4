 MUMBAI (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian shares may be subdued in early deals on Friday, tracking mostly lower Asian markets and with investors cautious ahead of weekly inflation data given worries about rising prices and slowing growth. India's annual inflation rate is forecast at 6.62 percent as at March 22, just off the previous week's 14-month high of 6.68 percent, a Reuters poll showed. The data is expected at 0630 GMT. "The market may open on a flat note and lose direction in later trade," said V.K. Sharma, head of research at Anagram Stock Broking Ltd. "If inflation figures come lower then it will be a good thing for the market." Annual inflation was "unacceptably" high, Reserve Bank of India Governor Yaga Venugopal Reddy said earlier this week, adding the central bank was ready to act if necessary. Asian stocks were trading cautiously ahead of U.S. jobs data report on Friday that is expected to raise fresh concerns that the world's biggest economy is closer to a recession. At 0319 GMT, Tokyo had slipped 0.7 percent and Seoul was down 0.2 percent, but Sydney had risen 0.7 percent. India's benchmark 30-share BSE index ended up 0.52 percent on Friday at 15,832.55 points. It is down 22 percent so far this year. The 50-share NSE index rose 0.37 percent to 4,771.60 and the Nifty April futures ended up at 4,784.85 points, widening the premium to the spot by 13 points. Foreign funds have been net sellers of $3.3 billion so far this year, after investing more than $17 billion in 2007
