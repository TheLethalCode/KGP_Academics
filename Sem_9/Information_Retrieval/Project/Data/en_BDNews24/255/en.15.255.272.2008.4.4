<TITLE> Iran president rejects nuclear incentives: Kyodo </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, April 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has rejected a reported new package of incentives being worked on to entice Iran to suspend its nuclear enrichment programme, Japan's Kyodo news agency reported on Friday. "This is a non-negotiable subject," Kyodo quoted Ahmadinejad as saying in an interview when asked his view on such an offer, reported to be being prepared by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. "Iran is a nuclear country and has no reason to give up the technology." Iran says it wants to produce nuclear fuel only for electricity so it can export more oil. But has been hit with three sets of United Nations sanctions for hiding the work until 2003, failing to prove to inspectors since then that it is wholly peaceful, and refusing to suspend the disputed programme. The Washington Times reported last month that the five permanent U.N. Security Council members were preparing a package of incentives aimed at Iran's recently elected parliament, in hopes of ending Iran's uranium enrichment programme. The proposal included economic, technological and security benefits, including help with developing a civilian nuclear energy programme, the paper quoted U.S. and European officials as saying. In February, EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana told Reuters the five major powers were discussing possible new moves to draw Iran into negotiations. Ahmadinejad said the suspension of its uranium enrichment programme was an issue related to the past, telling Kyodo "we have passed this stage". He repeated Iran's stance that it would pursue the nuclear issue only through the United Nation's nuclear watchdog agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Kyodo said. Diplomats said on Thursday Iran has begun installing advanced centrifuges in its key uranium enrichment complex, accelerating activity that could give it the means to make atom bombs in future if it chose to. After a pause of several months, Iran has now assembled more than 300 centrifuges divided into two cascades (interlinked networks) to expand beyond 3,000, diplomats with access to intelligence told Reuters. [ID:nL03813138] Centrifuges are technically temperamental tubes that spin at supersonic speed to refine uranium to levels suitable for power plants or bombs, depending on their configuration. The IAEA is pressing Iran to explain Western intelligence alleging that it conducted secret studies into how to "weaponise" nuclear materials despite its membership of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Iran says the information is forged. Asked about Japanese companies that have been reluctant to do new business in Iran because of the uncertainty caused by the nuclear issue, Ahmadinejad told Kyodo: "You must ask those companies why they are depriving themselves. The nuclear issue is a totally political issue."
