<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 31 (bdnews24.com) - Holders Abahani Limited look to reduce the gap in the points table of the Premier Cricket League when the Dhanmondi-based outfit take on leaders Mohammedan SC at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium Tuesday. Mohammedan are three points ahead of archrivals Abahani with 18 points from 10 outings, and they will face each other in the first-phase of the league before squaring off for the second time this season in the Super League, to be held some time after April 20. Both the old foes have already confirmed their eight-team Super League berths along with Biman Bangladesh and Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan. And another two teams still need to complete the Super League quota with newcomers Surjo Torun, City Club and Old DOHS fighting neck and neck with 10, nine and eight points from nine matches respectively. Mohammedan are flying high after a tense four-wicket win over Biman Bangladesh despite being reduced to a precarious 64 for six in the 19th over, chasing a paltry 175 to win the match. Abahani, on the other hand, returned to the winning streak with their batsmen showing superb performance to take the side over the 300-mark that helped them to win a massive 105-run over Sonargaon Cricketers in the previous match. Interestingly, Bangladesh captain and Mohammedan skipper Mohammad Ahraful is going to get the first-ever taste of tension in the match between the country's two old foes. Ashraful, however, felt no excitement for Tuesday's match, but was determined to keep their solo lead in the league winning the match against Abahani. "Now-a-days there is no excitement in club cricket that used to be in my childhood days from the galleries," Ashraful told bdnews24.com Monday. "Abahani are a good side, but I will want to consolidate our solo lead winning Tuesday's match," added the Motijheel-based outfit captain. Tushar Imran, the Abahani captain, was a bit worried for not getting the services of in-form batsman Jahirul Islam Ome and pacer Nazmul Hossain in Tuesday's match. "On paper, Mohammedan are better than us, but they are not unconquered in the league. "We hope we will win the match if we can play accordingly," said Tushar, who captained Abahani to clinch the Twenty20 title this season. bdn
