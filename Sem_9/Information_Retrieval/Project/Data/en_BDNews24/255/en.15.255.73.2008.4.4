 Moscow, April 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin promised increased support for Georgia's breakaway South Ossetia and Abkhazia regions on Thursday after NATO leaders said Georgia would one day be able to join the Western defence alliance. Putin has repeatedly warned against Georgia's integration with the alliance and, in a letter to the separatists' leaders, he linked Moscow's renewed support for the two rebel regions directly to Tbilisi's bid for NATO membership. Putin arrived at the NATO summit in Bucharest on Thursday hours after member countries committed to admitting Georgia, though without setting a date. "(President) Putin shared the concerns of the leaders of Abkhazia and South Ossetia about the likely negative consequences of Georgia's accession to NATO."

"This is why support for Abkhazia and South Ossetia will continue to be not declarative but concrete." Putin is to be a guest of honour at the NATO summit and take part in a session of the NATO-Russia Council on Friday. Analysts had earlier predicted Russia would retaliate over closer ties between NATO and Georgia by ramping up support to the separatist regions, though stopping short of recognising them as independent from Georgia. Russia's State Duma lower house of parliament unanimously adopted a resolution last month urging the Kremlin to consider recognising the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The resolution, branded by Tbilisi "barefaced interference" in Georgia's internal affairs, also called for speeding up the recognition if Georgia was put on the track to join NATO. Moscow has also signalled it could use Kosovo's declaration of independence from Serbia in February -- which it fiercely opposed -- as a precedent to recognise separatists closer to ho
