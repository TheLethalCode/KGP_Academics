<TEXT>
 Harare, April 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe's main opposition said on Sunday demands by President Robert Mugabe's ruling party for a recount of presidential election results were illegal and denied approaching ZANU-PF for a unity government. "The (Electoral) Act says that you ask for a recount within 48 hours of the counting. Counting takes place at polling stations so it's within 48 hours of that," said Tendai Biti, secretary general of the main opposition Movement for Democratic Change, led by Morgan Tsvangirai. "Legally they have no right to ask for a recount, they have absolutely no footing to ask for a recount so what they are trying to do is illegal. He also denied reports his party had approached ZANU-PF to form a unity government.
