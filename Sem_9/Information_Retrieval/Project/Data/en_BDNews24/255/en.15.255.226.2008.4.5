 Dhaka, April 5 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh Chhatra League workers hoisted black flags at Dhaka University Saturday and symbolically blindfolded the statues of the Aparajeo Bangla monument to protest against the participation of the president at the university's 44th convocation. President Iajuddin Ahmed is scheduled to preside over the convocation ceremony on Monday. Sohel Rana Tipu, president of the Dhaka University BCL unit, told bdnews24.com that the Iajuddin's part in the eventual release of the DU teachers and students arrested in connection with last August's campus unrest was shocking. He failed to play any role when the country's politics had been in trouble; he failed to prove that he was guardian of the university and its community, Tipu said. BCL is the student wing of Bangladesh Awami League. The Dhaka University teachers loyal to Awami League also expressed resentment at the president's role at the upcoming convocation. As many as 3,885 graduates and post graduates will be their awarded degrees on Monday. Of them, 52 would be honoured with gold medals for their outstanding academic performances. bdnew
