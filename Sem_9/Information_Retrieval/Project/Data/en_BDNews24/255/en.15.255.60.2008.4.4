<TITLE> Sarkozy unveils reforms, savings not seen until 2011 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PARIS, April 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Nicolas Sarkozy on Friday promised a major rationalisation of the French state, but indicated that savings would not come until 2011 and left questions unanswered over how he planned to balance the budget. Sarkozy said France needed to reduce its army of civil servants and introduce a wholesale shake-up of its bureaucracy, including the military administration and diplomatic service. "The time for reforms has come," he said in a speech at the Economy Ministry, and spending cuts were vital. "Each year, and for the past 20 years, state spending exceeds receipts by 20 percent... We cannot continue like this." The budget ministry estimated that the package of some 150 measures would provide gross annual savings of 7 billion euros ($11 billion) by 2011, although at least 1 billion of this would be handed back to civil servants by way of pay incentives. Such a net saving represents just 2 percent of state spending and compares with an annual budget deficit of 50 billion euros, suggesting the government faces an uphill battle to balance its books by 2012 as promised to the European Union. "This is a kind of cop out. Talking about 2011 or 2012 without saying what you're going to do from this year is a way of hiding behind fine speeches about reforming the state," said Michel Sapin, a Socialist party spokesman on economic affairs. The opposition Socialists have accused the government of quietly introducing an austerity programme to rein in the deficit, which hit 2.7 percent of gross domestic product last year, against a target of 2.4 percent. Sarkozy's government last week raised its 2008 deficit projection to 2.5 percent of GDP from 2.3 percent previously as a slowdown in growth is expected to weigh on tax receipts. PROTESTS Ministers have often stated that the long awaited reform of the state would bring in massive savings and among the measures mentioned by Sarkozy on Friday was his electoral pledge not to replace half of all retiring civil servants. This promise is already sparking protests, with school students regularly taking to the streets to denounce cuts in teaching numbers. Nationwide rallies on Thursday, at least two of which turned violent, suggested the movement was growing. Sarkozy said efficiencies could also be wrung from the military, which had distinct administrations for the army, navy and air force. In addition, he called for a change in rules that meant 70 percent of people were eligible for subsidized housing. Friday's announcement followed a similar operation in December, when Sarkozy outlined a series of measures aimed at reducing red tape in France and improving state services. A third and final raft of proposals are due to be unveiled in May, looking at welfare benefits and social spending. France's European partners are scrutinising the reforms closely, but they also want to see signs that Paris is serious about reducing its budget deficit for 2008. Speaking in Slovenia, Jean-Claude Juncker, chairman of the group of finance ministers whose countries have adopted the euro, said he, EU Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia, and European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet were eyeing the situation in France. "All three of us have stressed the fact that France's budget in 2008 should be applied with the greatest rigour." he said.
