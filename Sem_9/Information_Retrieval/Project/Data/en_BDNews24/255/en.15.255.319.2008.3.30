 Dhaka, March 30 (bdnews24.com)A 10-member technical team from Myanmar arrived in Dhaka Sunday to discuss the redrawing of sea boundaries between Bangladesh and its Southeast Asian neighbour. The team will hold talks with Bangladesh experts on maritime delimitation at state guesthouse Padma Monday and Tuesday. Addition foreign secretary MAK Mahmood will lead the 18-member Bangladesh team to the talks. "Bangladesh and Myanmar enjoy excellent bilateral cooperation and this will most certainly bring benefits to both friendly countries," foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury told reporters after his meeting with the visiting Myanmar team. Myanmar agreed to hold talks on maritime delimitation after a pause of more than 20 years. The sea boundary between Bangladesh and Myanmar shifts frequently for natural causes. Bangladesh has been demanding talks for years. The Myanmar junta agreed to hold talks with Bangladesh as Iftekhar in April last year visited Yangon, urging talks with the authorities. Mahmood in January this year went to Myanmar for setting the stage for the talks. bdn
