 WELLINGTON, April 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Opening batsman Aaron Redmond was the only newcomer named in New Zealand's test squad on Saturday for the tour of England that starts this month. Batsman Jesse Ryder, who made a spectacular start to his international career in the recent one-day series at home to England before injuring his hand during a late-night drinking session, was included in the one-day squad. Ryder, who required surgery, will need to pass a fitness test before the one-day series begins on June 15. Peter Fulton stands by to replace him. Redmond is the son of Rodney Redmond, who scored a century and a half-century in his only test appearance for New Zealand against Pakistan in 1973. "Aaron has been one of the ... leading top-order batsmen for a number of seasons. He has consistently made runs from the opening position, averaging over 40 this year," New Zealand Cricket selection manager Richard Hadlee said in a statement. "We hope he can provide a long-term solution to the top order which we recognise as still being a key issue." Aaron Redmond, who like his father has been called into the side at the age of 28, replaces Matthew Bell from the squad that lost the home test series 2-1 to England last month. Middle-order batsman Daniel Flynn, who was capped in the one-dayers against England, and the recalled James Marshall have also been named in the squads for the three tests, five one-dayers and one Twenty20 international. Mathew Sinclair was left out. Fulton, who has been injured and fighting a slump in form, is back, probably to fill the number three slot left vacant by the retirement of former captain Stephen Fleming. SECOND KEEPER Gareth Hopkins has been named as the second wicketkeeper to help cover the early part of the tour when Brendon McCullum is playing in the Indian Premier League (IPL). "The main test squad will total 16 players to include a second wicketkeeping option in Hopkins," said Hadlee. "Previously we had covered short term wicketkeeping with a batsman in the squad who can keep but we do not have that luxury with this squad." Captain Daniel Vettori, batsman Ross Taylor, all-rounder Jacob Oram, seam bowler Kyle Mills and McCullum will play in the IPL before joining the squad in England by May 1. Jamie How will act as skipper until Vettori arrives. The five IPL players will miss an exhibition match against an MCC side at Arundel on April 27 and a four-day game against Kent. The first test at Lord's starts on May 15. The second test in Manchester begins on May 23 while the third test in Nottingham starts on June 5. The one-day series begins in Durham on June 15. Test squad: Daniel Vettori (captain), Daniel Flynn, Peter Fulton, Gareth Hopkins, Jamie How, Brendon McCullum, James Marshall, Chris Martin, Kyle Mills, Iain O'Brien, Jacob Oram, Jeetan Patel, Aaron Redmond, Tim Southee, Ross Taylor. Either Mark Gillespie or Michael Mason will be added later. One-day squad: Vettori (captain), Flynn, Gillespie, Hopkins, How, Oram, Mason, Marshall, Mills, McCullum, Patel, Jesse Ryder, Scott Styris, Southee, Taylor. Mason, Gillespie and Grant Elliott will be part of the squad until May 1 when the five IPL-contracted players (Vettori, Oram, McCullum, Mills, Taylor) join squa
