 NAIROBI, April 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kenya's opposition said on Saturday that the naming of a power-sharing cabinet would be delayed, after it and President Mwai Kibaki's side disagreed over the division of ministries. "The widely expected announcement tomorrow of a new cabinet that all Kenyans were so keenly awaiting has been delayed," opposition spokesman Salim Lone said in a statement. Kibaki's spokesman Isaiya Kabira said the government would issue a statement soon. Bickering over the cabinet division started almost immediately after the announcement on Thursday that Kibaki's side and opposition leader Raila Odinga's Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) would split 40 ministries evenly. Kibaki and Odinga, who will become the prime minister under a peace deal brokered in February by former U.N. chief Kofi Annan, were under heavy local and international pressure to break a month-long deadlock on the cabinet. The formation of the power-sharing cabinet is being closely watched by investors as a sign that the east African nation is ready to leave behind the post-election violence that killed at least 1,200 people and displaced 300,000 more. The fury over Kibaki's disputed re-election prompted rioting and ethnic killings which harmed the shilling currency, stock market, tourism and economic growth, eroding Kenya's image as one of Africa's most stable, promising states.
