 Bogota , April 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A French medical team was on standby on Thursday to fly into Colombia's jungles to treat rebel hostage Ingrid Betancourt, a French-Colombian politician believed seriously ill after six years in guerrilla captivity. A successful mission would be the first direct contact in years with Betancourt, a former presidential candidate and the highest profile captive held in secret camps by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC guerrillas. President Alvaro Uribe says he will suspend military operations in the area once the team has the location where it will treat Betancourt, but it was unclear whether France had contacted the rebels or won their support for the initiative. "The French humanitarian mission has given us some information about where they think Ingrid Betancourt is being held," Uribe told the France 3 television channel. "We are ready to suspend military operations in the area in question." French President Nicolas Sarkozy has made Betancourt's release a priority, but so far few details have been revealed about the mission to treat her in a rebel camp. In a tough statement, FARC leader Rodrigo Granda said the killing of a senior commander in March complicated the situation and said rebels would not free Betancourt or any hostages without a deal to exchange them for jailed rebels. Granda did not refer directly to the mission for Betancourt or make clear if it would be allowed to go ahead. A French aircraft transporting the mission was waiting at a Bogota military air base, fueled and ready to fly to anywhere it was required inside Colombia, officials said. Latin America's oldest left-wing insurgency, the FARC has been weakened by Uribe's U.S.-backed security crackdown, and violence from Colombia's four-decade conflict has ebbed as troops have pushed rebels into more remote areas. FARC captives freed in recent months in deals brokered by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez say Betancourt is very ill with hepatitis. Images from a rebel video released last year showed her gaunt in a hidden jungle camp. A mother of two adult children who was educated in France, Betancourt has been chained to a tree after several attempts to escape her captors, the freed hostages say. STALLED PEACE BID France attempted a similar initiative in 2003 when it sent a military transport plane to Brazil's Amazon jungle region after Betancourt's family heard she might be released there. But Brazil and Colombia were angered when the aircraft arrived without warning in the Amazon city of Manaus, close to the Colombian border, and the FARC was unaware of the mission. Attempts to reach a deal to free 40 key hostages, including three U.S. contractors captured in 2003, in exchange for jailed rebels are deadlocked over a FARC demand that Uribe pull back troops from a swath of land to facilitate negotiations. Uribe, whose father was killed in a botched FARC kidnapping two decades ago, refuses to cede, but he has offered a smaller negotiating zone with an international observation team. Two top FARC commanders were killed in March, including Raul Reyes, a key contact for attempts to negotiate a hostage accord. Those strikes have raised questions about the rebel leadership and the chances of reaching an agreement. Colombia's attack on Reyes inside Ecuadorean territory also sparked an Andean crisis with Ecuador and ally Venezuela sending troops to their borders with Colombia. Regional tensions are still high as Uribe, a staunch US ally, accuses his leftist neighbors of sheltering the FARC. Betancourt and her vice presidential candidate, Clara Rojas, were captured at a rebel roadblock while campaigning in 2002 in a southern province. Rojas gave birth to a boy while in captivity. She was one of the hostages released in January under a deal arranged by Chavez, a left-winger who has stoked tensions with Bogota by calling for more political recognition for the guerrillas. Started as a Marxist peasant army, the FARC once controlled large swaths of Colombia, but rebels have been driven back in recent years.
