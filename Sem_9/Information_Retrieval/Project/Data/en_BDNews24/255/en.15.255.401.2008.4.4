 JOHANNESBURG, April 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Haroon Lorgat, the new chief executive of the International Cricket Council (ICC), has a proven ability to juggle politics and cricket, something that should stand him in good stead in his new post. The 47-year-old Lorgat, whose appointment was confirmed on Friday, headed South Africa's selection panel from 2004 to 2007. He also served on the 2003 World Cup organising committee and was treasurer of Cricket South Africa (CSA). "I have no doubt he will make a success of the ICC job, he has very good business acumen and he was Cricket South Africa's treasurer for a while," said CSA chief executive Gerald Majola who played provincial cricket with Lorgat in the 1970s and has served alongside him on numerous administrative committees. "He will do a good job because he understands the game and is passionate about it." A thoughtful, level-headed man, Lorgat, a South African of Indian descent, will be expected to bridge the divide between East and West in cricket's corridors of power. He completed his accounting articles with Coopers & Lybrand before going it alone for eight years. He joined Ernst & Young as a senior partner in 2002, before setting up Kapela Investments with five associates last year and is based in Cape Town. Lorgat was a left-handed batsman but a right-arm seamer who scored 2,813 runs and took 191 wickets in 76 first-class matches. He is married with a son and a daughter. Lorgat will take over from Malcolm Speed after the governing body's annual conference starting on June 2
