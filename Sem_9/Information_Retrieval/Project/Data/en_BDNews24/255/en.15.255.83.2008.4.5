<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 5 (bdnews24.com)  Progressive Democratic Party convener Ferdous Ahmad Quarishi said Saturday the ongoing food crisis was being adversely affected by the 'exaggerated reports' in the media. He said BNP and Awami League were scoring political points over the food crisis using the media. "Motivated by politics, the media are campaigning to encourage hoarders and deepen the crisis." "Their campaign has sparked panic," Quarishi said at a press conference at the party's central office in Segunbagicha. Quarishi asked the caretaker administration to launch a rationing system immediately and ensure food security by slashing allocation to other sectors. bdnews24
