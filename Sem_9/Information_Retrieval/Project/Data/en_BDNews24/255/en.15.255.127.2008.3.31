 DUBLIN, March 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bank of Ireland expects to report slower earnings growth than hoped for after volatile markets and a weak British pound failed to recover sufficiently for it to meet goals set in November. Ireland's second-biggest bank by market value said on Monday it expected to report underlying earnings per share growth of 3 to 5 percent for the year to the end of March. "The performance of the group is as indicated in our recent interim management statement," Bank of Ireland said in a brief trading update to coincide with the end of its business year. Bank of Ireland had said in February that it feared weak stock markets, a fall in the value of sterling against the euro and exposure to structured investment vehicles could shave 70 million euros ($110.4 million) off profit for the year. It said at the time that, excluding those factors, percentage growth in EPS would be in high single digits but that it would fall short of that level at 3 to 5 percent if there was no market improvement. In line with Ireland's other banks, shares in Bank of Ireland have halved over the past 12 months after the global credit crisis compounded worries over an end to the country's decade-long property boom and the resulting slowdown in lending growth. Bank of Ireland has steadily reined in its earnings forecasts this year from a low double-digit percent forecast given in May, to the high single digits originally predicted in November and the 3 to 5 percent now anticipated. Shares in the bank were 0.2 percent lower at 9.48 euros by 1123 GMT and performing broadly in line with a 0.3 percent weaker Irish mark
