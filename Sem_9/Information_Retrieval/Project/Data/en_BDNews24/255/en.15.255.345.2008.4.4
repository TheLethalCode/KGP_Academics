 Bucharest, April 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ukraine's pro-Western president sought to reassure Russia on Friday that its bid to join NATO was not aimed against Moscow, shortly before the alliance's farewell summit with President Vladimir Putin. NATO promised on Thursday that Ukraine and Georgia would one day join the Western defence alliance but did not put them on an immediate track to membership, partly because of Russian opposition to membership for the former Soviet republics. "Our state has the full right to choose our own way of development, protect our security and our interests. Our interests are not destined (to be) against any other country," Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko said. "This is a historic event for our people and our country," Yushchenko said at the start of talks with NATO on the last day of a three-day alliance summit in the Romanian capital, Bucharest. NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer again assured Ukraine it would be set on a path to NATO membership, saying: "This is a signal from NATO that we value this relationship." But uncertainty remained about how Putin, who opposes NATO membership for countries once in Moscow's sphere of influence, would respond to the alliance pushing open its doors to Georgia and Ukraine. Initial Kremlin reaction was caustic but not explosive. The Russian Foreign Ministry published a letter on Thursday in which Putin assured rebels in breakaway Georgian regions he would not abandon them if Tbilisi cuddled up to the West. SEEKING A THAW NATO's meeting with Putin is designed to begin a thaw in chilly relations with their former Cold War foe and lay the ground for a new start with his successor, Dmitry Medvedev. U.S. President George W. Bush, who like Putin is in the twilight of his presidency, will follow the NATO-Russia summit with a weekend meeting at the Russian leader's holiday home he has called a last chance for a "heart-to-heart". Out to polish a legacy tarnished by the Iraq war, Bush wants to raise ideas for a "strategic framework" agreement between the United States and Russia during his stay with Putin a day later at the Black Sea resort of Sochi. The Kremlin said Putin had come to the Romanian capital determined to focus on the positive and play down disputes with the West ranging from Kosovo to U.S. missile shield plans. It will be the first time NATO leaders have hosted a Russian president since 2002 and could help them gauge how much power Putin plans to retain after Medvedev takes over as president next month. Putin is expected to become prime minister. Few NATO allies dare to predict how Putin, who in the past year has accused the West of wanting to start a new arms race and threatened to target nuclear weapons on NATO aspirant Ukraine, would behave in the two-hour session. Bush appealed to Putin ahead of the meeting to embrace the U.S. plan for a missile defence shield based partly in Poland and the Czech Republic. Putin has fiercely criticised Washington's plan, seeing it as an encroachment on the former Soviet sphere of influence. Bush again said in Bucharest on Thursday the missile shield was not aimed at Moscow but meant to deter missile threats from countries such as Iran that Washington considers dangerous. "The Cold War is over. Russia is not our enemy," he said. Russian officials said no immediate progress was expected on missile defence or the other contentious issues, but that Putin came ready to seek cooperation. NATO and Russia will sign a land transit agreement later on Friday allowing the alliance to use Russian land to deliver non-lethal supplies to its troops in Afghanistan, a NATO spokeswoman said. The agreement will not cover movements of troops or air transit arrangements as initially sought by NA
