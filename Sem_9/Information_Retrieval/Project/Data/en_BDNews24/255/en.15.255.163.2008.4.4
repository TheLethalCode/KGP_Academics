<TEXT>
 SEOUL, April 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The chairman of the Samsung Group, one of South Korea's richest and most powerful men, reported to a special prosecutor on Friday to answer questions about possible corruption at the country's largest conglomerate. South Korea launched the special probe in January after accusations by a former top Samsung legal executive that the firm kept a war chest of over $200 million to bribe officials in order to quash investigations into its management practices. The country's family-owned conglomerates known as "chaebol" have been accused for years of having ties too close to the government. Some of their leaders have been convicted of white-collar crime, but have avoided long jail sentences due to judges who felt such penalties could hurt the economy. "I have never even thought that Samsung was a criminal organization," Samsung Group Chairman Lee Kun-hee said in response to a reporter's question. "The problem lies with you for describing it that way." When asked if he had directly ordered the formation of a slush fund, Lee said: "No". Lee's arrival at the special prosecutor's office, at the centre of a throng of hundreds of police and reporters, was broadcast live on national television. Some 20 protesters, shouting "Lee Kun-hee repent", scuffled with police as they tried to force their way into the building. Lee faced a long session with prosecutors after arriving at the office at about 2 p.m. local time. "There are many things to ask. Today's inquiry will continue until 11 p.m. or even midnight," Yun Jung-sok, spokesman for the special prosecutor, was quoted by Yonhap news agency as telling reporters. Samsung has denied any wrongdoing and called the accusations groundless. Samsung Group spokesman Yim Jun-seok said on Thursday that the group was "surprised and concerned" about the summons. Separately on Friday, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, the flagship company of the Samsung Group, said it would release its first-quarter results on April 25, two days after the scheduled end of the probe. Samsung Electronics usually releases its quarterly results before the middle of the month. "We decided it would be best to release earnings after the end of the special probe," said James Chung, a spokesman for Samsung Electronics. Lee propelled Samsung into the top ranks of South Korea's family-controlled business groups. Under his control, Samsung grew to a giant group with about 60 affiliates, accounting for around a fifth of the country's exports. On Wednesday, the special counsel questioned Lee's wife on suspicion of tapping into a Samsung Group slush fund to purchase modern paintings valued at millions of dollars. Prosecutors have so far raided and searched various locations belonging to the Samsung Group, including Chairman Lee's private residence and offices of Samsung Electronics
