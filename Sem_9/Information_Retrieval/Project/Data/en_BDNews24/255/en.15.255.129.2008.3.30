<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 30 (bdnews24.com)  A polished 111-run partnership between Raqibul Hasan and Suhrawardi Shuvo helped Mohammedan SC to regain the lead in the Premier Division Cricket League when they handed a four-wicket defeat to the national flag carrier Sunday. Mohammedan raced to 175 for six with four more overs to go after restricting Biman to a paltry total of 174 for eight in 50 overs at Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. After two losses, title contenders Abahani Limited returned to the winning track with a convincing 105-run victory over Sonargaon Cricketers at the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan (BKSP) ground. Newcomers BKSP tasted their seventh win in nine matches when the country's lone sports educational institution defeated Kalabagan SC by 96 runs at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. Surjo Torun Club thrashed Young Pegasus by 36 runs to maintain their fifth position in the point table at the BKSP ground. City Club beat Partex SC by two wickets at Dhanmondi Cricket Stadium. Mohammedan vs Biman Chasing a modest 174 set by Biman, it seemed a distant goal for Mohammedan, who were reduced to 64 for six in 19 overs in the face of a fierce spell from pacer Mashrafee Bin Mortaza. Paceman Mahbubul Alam brought the first breakthrough for Biman, having opener Junaed Siddique (2) caught behind the wicket in the fourth over of the innings, while Mashrafee dismissed another opener Imtiaz Hossain (7) in the seventh over to topple Mohammedan to 18 for two. Anwar Hossain and Aftab Ahmed, who survived a bold caught-behind appeal in his first ball knock, tried to repair the damage, but it was short-lived as spinner Mosharraf Hossain Rubel bowled Anwar (24), leaving Mohammedan at 42 for three in the 12th over. Afterwards, Mashrafee sent Aftab (19) back with a superb return catch in the 17th over and uprooted Ashraful (7) in his next over, then dismissed Pakistani Aqeel Arshad (0) in his seventh over to reduce Mohammedan to 64 for six in 19th over. But Raqibul and man of the match Suhrawardi prevented further damage, keeping their heads cool as they concentrated on single runs to put up 111 for the unbroken seventh wicket, though some wobbly fielding from Biman allowed Mohammedan to reach home. Raqibul topscored with 55 off 88 balls featuring a four, while Suhrawardi played a 90-ball 54 that was studded with two fours. Mashrafee returned four for 14 in eight overs, though the Bangladesh pace spearhead could not bowl in his last two overs following his delayed return to the field after a break. Earlier, Biman failed to post a competitive total as national discard Tapash Kumar Baisya claimed four for 36 and left-arm spinner Suhrawardi took two for 42. Biman opener Tamim Iqbal played an uncharacteristic 65 off 113 balls featuring only three fours, while skipper Sanwar Hossain was the second highest scorer with 31 off 59 balls. Abahani vs Sonargaon Abahani bundled Sonargaon out for 220 in 36.2 overs after posting a mammoth 325 for five in 50 overs, riding on three fifties from opener Mahbubul Karim (77), Jahirul Islam (84) and Ziaur Rahman (60 not out). Sonargaon openers Mostafizur Rahman (55), Aontu (42) and Fahad Ullah (46) laid a solid foundation, but all was in vain as Arafat Salahuddin (3/43), Tushar Imran (2/34) and Ziaur Rahman (2/30) caused the main damage to the opponent's innings. BKSP vs Kalabagan BKSP restricted Kalabgan to 181 for eight in 50 overs after scoring a challenging 277 for nine in 50 overs, thanks to a 145-run knock from national wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim. Mushfiq smashed 11 fours and three sixes in his 134-ball knock. Opener M Mithun (40), Nasir Hossain (27) and Mahmudul Hasan (27) were other notable BKSP scorers on their way past the 250-mark. Surjo Torun vs Young Pegasus Chasing 239 runs to win, set by Surjo Torun, Pegasus ended up at 202 all out in 42.4 overs as Mohammad Young wiped up the Pegasus innings with four for 20. Despite Sabbir Ahmed's 64 and opener Robiul Islam's 41, Pegasus saw 36 runs short of the target. City Club vs Partex Openers Imran Ahmed smashed a superb 96 as City Club raced to 258 for eight in exactly 50 overs, in reply to Partex's 257 for eight in 50 overs. Earlier, Partex put up a competitive total on the board, riding on a 114-run knock from Pakistani Rashed Hanif after deciding to bat first winning the toss. bd
