<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 4 (bdnews24.com)The chief election commissioner will have to take responsibility for any delayed election, said BNP leader Khandaker Delwar Hossain Friday. "The CEC has already muddied the water by excluding the mainstream BNP from electoral dialogue," Delwar, BNP's disputed secretary general, appointed by party chairperson Khaleda Zia, told reporters, after he returned from abroad. "In case this stalemate delays the election or it is cancelled completely, we'll hold him (CEC ATM Shamsul Huda) responsible for the failure," he said. The BNP leader came down hard on the government for the spiralling food costs that are "pushing the multitudes into a silent famine". On returning home Thursday after spending about a month in the US and Singapore for medical treatment, Delwar and wife Sahera Hossain expressed their gratitude to countrymen for their "support" during his illness. Delwar underwent treatment for heart and kidney ailments. On a party unification process, Delwar said: "The chairperson has the authority to say anything about those who have been expelled from the party." Asked to comment on the government's attempt to hold dialogue with political parties, Delwar said: "I'll talk about it after discussing the matter with party leaders." Differing with food adviser AMM Shawkat Ali's statement on 'hidden hunger', Delwar said: "There's an acute shortage of food in the country. People are jobless and don't have the money to buy high-priced food. This is famine." Slating the CEC, the former chief whip said: "The government is constitutionally bound to help the EC hold a free and fair election in 90 days. The EC roadmap spells a long, long journey. We must appreciate that people are at the centre of all authority and control." bdnew
