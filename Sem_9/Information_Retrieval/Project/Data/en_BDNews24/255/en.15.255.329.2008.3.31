 Dhaka, March 31 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Railway will suspend rail operations to and from Kamalapur Railway Station during the capital's peak travel hours to reduce the city's traffic jams, home ministry officials said. The decision will come into effect from Pahela Baishakh. No train will travel to or from Kamalapur station from 8.30am to 9.30am. Train movements to and from the station will also be suspended in the late afternoon from 4.45pm to 6.00pm. The decision was approved Monday at a home ministry meeting. Home affairs adviser MA Matin chaired the meeting of the committee formed to reduce traffic jams in Dhaka. The move follows a recent request from the Dhaka Metropolitan Police to the railway authorities for assistance in mitigating the huge tailbacks during rush hours at the city's 28 rail crossings. Dhaka police say many of the city's major roads are most frequently blocked at these crossings for trains departing or arriving at Kamalapur Railway Station. People loose about six working hours a day, said one ministry official. "This is why the decision has been taken to stop train movement during those times." Ministry officials said steps were also being taken so that no train enters Dhaka city during the morning and afternoon rush periods. MA Matin told reporters after the meeting that further recommendations to tackle the city's gridlock had been tabled by the committee. "People concerned have been directed to review these," the home adviser said. bdnew
