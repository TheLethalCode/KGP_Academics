 ROME, March 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rome's Stadio Olimpico could lose the right to host the 2009 Champions League final if there were further violent incidents at Tuesday's quarter-final between AS Roma and Manchester United, UEFA said on Monday. Stabbings by roving gangs armed with flick-knives happen often around the stadium, with violence flaring during United's last two visits to Rome. There were also incidents at Roma's knockout round game with Real Madrid last month. "If tomorrow at Roma-Manchester United, incidents are proved to have happened outside the stadium which are like those at the match with Real - with people stabbed - we would have to reconsider the decision to assign the 2009 Champions League final to Rome," UEFA spokesman William Gaillard told Italian radio, according to ANSA news service
