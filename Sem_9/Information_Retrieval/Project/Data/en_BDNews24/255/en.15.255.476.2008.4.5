<TITLE> UK`s Brown, Mbeki to hold talks over Zimbabwe </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, April 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British Prime Minister Gordon Brown will hold talks with South African President Thabo Mbeki on Saturday during which the post-election crisis in Zimbabwe is likely to be discussed, a spokesman for Brown said. "The prime minister will meet Thabo Mbeki this morning," the spokesman said. Zimbabwe was likely to be on the agenda when the two leaders meet on the sidelines of a conference, he said. Brown is hosting a "progressive governance" conference in Watford, just outside London, and Mbeki is one of the attendees. Mbeki, along with other African and international leaders, is trying to find a solution to the crisis in Zimbabwe following last week's elections. The opposition Movement for Democratic Change says its leader Morgan Tsvangirai defeated President Robert Mugabe in the presidential election. Mugabe has signalled he wants to fight to extend his 28-year rule. The MDC goes to court on Saturday to force the release of results from the presidential poll.
