 LONDON, April 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Arsenal and Liverpool drew 1-1 for the third time this season on Saturday as the London side's Premier League title hopes suffered another blow. After the midweek draw between the sides at the Emirates gave Liverpool a slight advantage in their Champions League quarter-final, Arsenal could now end the weekend eight points behind league leaders Manchester United with five games left. Liverpool gained a deserved first-half lead through Peter Crouch's firm finish after 40 minutes. Arsenal improved after the break and drew level in the 54th minute when Nicklas Bendtner powered a header past Liverpool keeper Pepe Reina. Both sides had chances to claim a win in the closing stages but the points were shared to strengthen Liverpool's hold on fourth place over rivals Everton. Arsenal moved above Chelsea on goal difference into second place with 71 points but Chelsea will reclaim that place if they beat Manchester City later on Saturday. Manchester United, who have 76 points, play Middlesbrough on Sunday. Crouch was given a rare start by manager Rafael Benitez with top scorer Fernando Torres dropping to the bench and the tall England striker was impressive. He forced Arsenal keeper Manuel Almunia into an athletic save in the opening exchanges and then played in John Arne Riise but the Norwegian failed to hit the target. Bendtner wasted a good chance for Arsenal before Crouch struck to put Liverpool in front after escaping the attention of William Gallas and driving a shot past Almunia. Cesc Fabregas was the provider for Arsenal's equaliser eight minutes after the break. His flighted free kick was met by Bendtner and he thudded a header past Reina. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger sent on leading striker Emanuel Adebayor, rested with an eye on Tuesday's Champions League second leg, in a bid to win the game but despite plenty of pressure Arsenal could find no way through. Arsenal substitute Alexander Hleb mis-controlled when well placed to score while at the other end Andriy Voronin spurned a great chance for Liverpool when he shot over from a Crouch cross
