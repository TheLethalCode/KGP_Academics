<TITLE> Cyprus tears down barricade dividing island </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Nicosia, Thu Apr 4, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Greek and Turkish Cypriots pulled down barricades on Thursday separating them for half a century, reopening a street which became a symbol of Cyprus's ethnic partition. The reopening of Ledra Street was meant to be a step towards ending the island's division, an obstacle to Turkey's membership of the European Union and a source of tension between NATO partners Athens and Ankara. Hundreds of Greek and Turkish Cypriots crossed Ledra after the 80-metre (262 ft) stretch of road in the main commercial district of Nicosia was opened to pedestrians in a ceremony attended by UN envoys and dignitaries from both communities. "I couldn't sleep all night. I will walk to St Loukas church (on the Turkish Cypriot side) and light a candle," said Loukia Skordi Salidou, 65. "My generation is dying. Thank God I'm alive to see this." An upmarket shopping street on the Greek Cypriot side, Ledra fans out into the alleyways of the Turkish Cypriot quarter to the north of Nicosia in a maze of haberdasheries and fruit markets. "We all know opening Ledra Street does not mean the Cyprus problem is resolved. There is much more hard work to be done," said Elizabeth Spehar, the chief of mission for the United Nations in Cyprus, at the ceremony. "But the opening gives us a glimpse of what is possible." Underscoring unresolved disputes, the presence of Turkish Cypriot police in the disputed U.N.-controlled no-man's-land between the two sides triggered the abrupt re-closure of Ledra on Thursday evening for two hours. "The checkpoint has now been reopened and terms of the deal (to open it) were restored ... we have been given assurances it will not happen again," said Stefanos Stefanou, a spokesman for the Greek Cypriot-led government. Cyprus has been divided since 1974, when Turkey invaded in response to a brief Greek-inspired coup. The division of Ledra Street precedes that by some 15 years, when barricades were erected by Turkish Cypriots in 1958. A more permanent roadblock was erected after ethnic strife in 1963. Greek and Turkish Cypriots agreed last month to relaunch talks, ending a five-year stalemate in reunification efforts. "By opening this street, we hope the road to a solution to the Cyprus problem will also open," George Iacovou, an aide to Cyprus President Demetris Christofias, told reporters. REUNIFICATION HOPES Christofias's election last month, on discontent with his predecessor's hardline policies towards Turkish Cypriots, raised hopes for a revival of talks stalled since Greek Cypriots rejected a U.N. reunification blueprint in a 2004 referendum. Cyprus joined the EU soon afterwards, gaining veto power over Turkey's accession process. The international community recognizes the Greek Cypriot-controlled government in the south as the island's legitimate authority, while the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north is recognized only by Ankara. The European Commission welcomed the opening of Ledra Street, saying it was an important confidence-building step. Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat are expected to enter full-fledged negotiations this summer, after assessing progress in preparatory talks. "This is a historic event," said Talat's aide, Ozdil Nami, at the opening. "A small step, but a very important step." Once known as "murder mile" from the days when Greek Cypriot guerrillas targeted British colonial troops, Ledra cuts through the heart of medieval Nicosia and across the UN-patrolled "green line" splitting the city of about 250,000 residents. On Thursday, peace campaigners on the Turkish Cypriot side of the street welcomed Greek Cypriots by beating drums. "We want more streets to open until there are no checkpoints left," said Turkish Cypriot laborer Ahmet Jemal,
