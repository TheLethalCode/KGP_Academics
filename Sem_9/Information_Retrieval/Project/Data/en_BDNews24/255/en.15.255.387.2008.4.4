<TITLE> BOJ to hold rates, debate slowing economic growth </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Tokyo, April 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Bank of Japan is expected to keep interest rates on hold and debate mounting risks to growth at a rate review next week, set to be held without a permanent governor as the post has been left vacant due to political wrangling. Masaaki Shirakawa, deputy governor and acting head of the bank, will chair the two-day meeting that ends on Wednesday which, among other issues, will likely discuss how much the BOJ might need to cut its economic forecast in a twice-yearly outlook report due out later this month. A stronger yen and rising raw material costs have clouded the outlook for corporate activity, a key driver of the economy, heightening views that Japan may follow the United States into a recession and prompt the BOJ to cut rates later this year. But the central bank is expected to keep its key policy rate unchanged at 0.5 percent until clearer signs of economic trouble become evident. "There is obviously very little the BOJ can do to help the economy with interest rates already so low," said Koichi Haji, chief economist at NLI Research Institute. "The only thing the bank can do now is to keep policy on hold and say that when things get worse, it would act decisively." The policy review comes ahead of a meeting of Group of Seven finance leaders expected to be held in Washington on April 11, where worries about a credit squeeze, shaky financial markets and slowing global growth will likely be discussed. Swap contracts on the overnight call rate show a roughly 20 percent chance of a rate cut by June and a 55 percent chance of a cut by year-end. The BOJ has said it will raise rates gradually in line with improvements in the economy. But financial market turmoil and signs of weakness in Japan's economy have kept it from hiking rates since February last year. The nine-member board will meet with two seats vacant, one for the permanent governor and another left open after Kiyohiko Nishimura, previously a board member, became deputy governor. FORECAST CUT EYED Japan's economy grew 0.9 percent in October-December from the previous quarter, or an annualised 3.5 percent, but the outlook is less promising, with big companies slashing capital spending plans, the business mood slumping to a four-year low and industrial output softening. Many within the central bank now expect fiscal 2008/09 economic growth to be around or slightly below Japan's potential growth rate of 1.5 to 2.0 percent, BOJ sources say. That would be largely in line with private think tank estimates but lower than a median forecast of 2.1 percent growth in the BOJ's previous semiannual outlook report in October. The BOJ may thus revise down its assessment of the economy in the next semiannual report due on April 30, although it is likely to stick to its stance that a positive economic cycle remains in place, economists say. "The BOJ may tone down its wording a bit on the economy but will leave its basic policy framework unchanged," said Masaaki Kanno, chief Japan economist at JPMorgan Securities. "We did see some weak economic indicators but none of them were strikingly bad enough to trigger a policy shift," he said. While recent sentiment surveys have been soft, including the BOJ's closely watched tankan quarterly survey, hard data has been surprisingly solid. Japanese exports continue to increase despite slowing US growth, while personal consumption has held up well even though wages have barely risen. The BOJ has been without a permanent governor for two weeks, after opposition parties that control parliament's upper house twice blocked nominees to replace retiring Governor Toshihiko Fukui. A top government spokesman said on Thursday that Tokyo wants a new BOJ head in time for the G7 meeting. The Nikkei newspaper reported on Friday that Shirakawa could be nominated as permanent govern
