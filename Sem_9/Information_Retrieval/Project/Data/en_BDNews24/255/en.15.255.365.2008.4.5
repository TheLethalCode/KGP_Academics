The Brazilian, who will miss the rest of the season after tearing a leg muscle, has had a disappointing campaign at the Nou Camp and media reports say the 28-year-old is poised to leave. Milan, languishing outside a Champions League place in Serie A, have been long-time admirers of the forward and have had trouble scoring and creating chances this term. Milan striker Ronaldo has also been ruled out long term with a knee injury. Asked if Milan would buy Ronaldinho, Berlusconi told Italian news service ANSA: "I hope so, I think so.

The forward has also been linked with a move to England in the media. Berlusconi also gave his backing to under fire Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti and struggling forward Alberto Gilardino.
