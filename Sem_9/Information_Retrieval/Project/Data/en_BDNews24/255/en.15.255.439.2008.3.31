<TITLE> Not just recession fears </TITLE>

 Brian Love PARIS, March 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sky-high food prices are prompting one country after another to curtail exports in favour of domestic supply, a trend India joined on Friday hard on Vietnam's heels with a sharp increase in export prices for rice, national staples in both countries. Cameroon, smarting from food price riots that rights groups say killed as many as 100 people last month, announced cutbacks in official travel abroad to help finance wage rises for state employees. Another big concern for governments and financial markets is whether the United States is headed into or already in recession and if it will be long or strong enough to seriously damage the rest of the global economy too. On that point, Wall Street investment bank Goldman Sachs believes people are not being pessimistic enough. "While we also see growth bottoming mid-year, we think the bottom will be deeper and the recovery profile shallower," the bank's economists said of the United States in a weekly note to clients. So far, news suggests the U.S. economy more or less stopped growing in early 2008, Japan slowed to snail-pace and Europe, the other pillar of the industrialised world, lost steam too, though nowhere near as dramatically. Further details from March business surveys -- the so-called purchasing managers indices -- may shed some more light on just how weakly the first quarter of 2008 finished. Though short of surprises, the picture is the one that emerged last week. The U.S. economy slowed to an annualised growth rate of just 0.6 percent in the last three months of 2007, which means actual growth of less than 0.2 percent, and profits contracted for both financial and non-financial companies, U.S. Commerce department data showed. That confirmed earlier estimates of the extent to which U.S. growth is hurting from the housing slump and sub-prime mortgage market meltdown, which has since generated a broader crisis in global financial markets and hit banks hard. March U.S. payrolls data on Friday could provide more of an up-to-date gauge of how the job market is faring. In Japan, one of the country's most closely watched economic indicators, the central bank's "tankan" survey of business morale, should give a flavour of how things can be expected to unfold in an economy that Tokyo concedes has run out of steam. "How long a soft patch in Japan would continue will depend largely on how much the U.S. economy slows down and for how long," Economics Minister Hiroko Ota said last week. What perhaps surprised most economists in the week just gone was how well Europe is doing, relatively speaking, as the other pillars of the industrialised world tremble. Despite the prevailing gloom about the broader economy, business confidence improved in the two largest economies of the euro zone, Germany and France, in March. Official reports on industrial orders for January in the euro zone also came in much stronger than predicted. However, few believe Europe is fully immunized against a U.S. slowdown by demand from more rapidly growing emerging market economies either. "Oil, gold, metals and food prices are hitting record levels and we are experiencing a global crisis of confidence," said Angel Gurria, head of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. "Although some emerging economies are still growing strongly, there is no 'decoupling' and the impact of the U.S. situation is still to be felt." In addition, fear of a lasting run-up in inflation is running high, fuelled by news from Germany that annual inflation rose to 3.3 percent in March, just a touch short of the all-time record, primarily because of rising food and energy prices. Commodities prices did ease late last week from recent records. That would eventually provide some relief from food inflation, if it lasted, but that is a call few are ready to make with conviction so soon.
