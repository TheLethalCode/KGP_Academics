 Dhaka, March 30 (bdnews24.com) -- Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina Sunday alleged that she was forced to appear in court. Full Story The Awami League chief was discharged from Square Hospital shortly after 2pm, its general manager James Gomes told bdnews24.com. "Some medical treatments of the former prime minister are yet to be finished, but she does not need to be readmitted here," Gomes said. In court, Hasina alleged that her medical treatment had not been complete and that she was taken to court by force. The court resumed a hearing in a case against Hasina, which accuses her of illegally awarding contracts for three barge-mounted power plants during her term as prime minister. The detained AL president was taken back to special jail from court at 3:14pm. Hasina appeared in court on the Sangsad Bhaban premises for the first time since she had been admitted to Square Hospital on March 11. The AL chief described to the court her present physical condition and complained of receiving inadequate medical attention. "I was asked to appear in court by 2pm, contrary to the advice of the doctors. The hospital authorities discharged me on the request of the prison authorities," said the Awami League chief. Hasina claimed to be in immediate danger of losing her sight as a result of "negligence". "I have lost 25 percent of the vision in my left eye. I will go blind if I do not get treatment right now." Hasina asked the judge: "From whom will I get justice?" The former prime minister denied allegations made by the prison authorities that claimed the AL chief's own reluctance was the reason she had not earlier appeared in court. Hasina said she had a number of medical tests to complete on the day she was previously scheduled to appear. She said her eye specialist had been treating her for the last 25 years, while her gynaecologist had been treating her for 37 years. "But they were not allowed to see me in the hospital. Five unfamiliar doctors have been treating me." The former prime minister told the court a seven-member medical board examined her after she was admitted to the hospital on March 11, although no other senior doctor had attended her. Hasina submitted a medical report to the judge and told him she had not been allowed to see the contents. "I need ear treatment that is not available anywhere but the US. I have not yet received any treatment for this problem." "Earlier, while I was receiving eye treatment, my allergies and blood pressure increased." The AL president has made repeated complaints that her access to legal counsel and relatives had been unduly restricted by the jail authorities. "I was not given any chance to consult with my lawyers about the case and I met with my relatives last on Feb 14." "Yesterday the authorities allowed my relatives to visit me, but I could not talk with them because of the prison rules." Hasina alluded to her detention in 1971, when she was also refused visitation rights with her relatives: "What is the difference between them and the Pakistan army?" Hasina was permitted to address the court for 10 minutes, after which the judge asked the AL leader's lawyers to proceed to the charge framing hearing. Hasina's lawyer, Quamrul Islam, told the judge that senior lawyers from his team had left the court after waiting until 2pm, and that it was not possible continue without them. He appealed to the court to defer the date for the hearing, adding that they had also been unable to discuss the matter with their client due to her physical condition. Quamrul appealed to the court to arrange for better treatment for their client in addition to requesting she not be returned to the special jail. The judge deferred the case proceedings until April 3. bdnews24.com
