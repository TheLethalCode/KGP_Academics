 LONDON, March 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid moved six points clear at the top of the Primera Liga with eight games still to play after comfortably seeing off Sevilla 3-1 at the Bernabeu on Sunday. Inter Milan maintained their four-point lead in Serie A after the defending champions drew 1-1 at Lazio and second-placed AS Roma could manage the same score only at struggling Cagliari. SPAIN Goals from Gabriel Heinze, Raul and Gonzalo Higuain secured Real Madrid three points which were never really in doubt, despite Frederic Kanoute levelling for the visitors just before the break. Barcelona (58 points) lost ground on the leaders (65) after letting slip a two-goal lead to lose 3-2 away to Real Betis on Saturday. That defeat also saw them lose second place as Villarreal climbed above them onto 59 points, with an impressive 3-0 victory at home to fourth-placed Atletico Madrid also on Saturday. Racing Santander are fifth, level on 50 points with Atletico, after winning 3-0 away to Espanyol on Sunday. ITALY Hernan Crespo gave Inter an early lead against his former club but Lazio, who had the chances to win, levelled through Tommaso Rocchi's possibly-offside goal. AC Milan's hopes of a Champions League place next season took another blow when they slipped to sixth after a 2-1 home defeat by Atalanta. Andrea Pirlo missed a late penalty to equalise. Sunday's game between Juventus and Parma was postponed after a Parma fan was accidentally knocked down and killed by a bus following a dispute with Juve supporters. ENGLAND More magic from Cristiano Ronaldo helped leaders Manchester United to a 4-0 drubbing of Aston Villa on Saturday as they ended the weekend with their five-point gap intact. Ronaldo opened the scoring with a cute backheel and also set up two second-half efforts for strike partner Wayne Rooney. United have 76 points with six games remaining and look in unstoppable form. Chelsea are their nearest challengers and remain in the hunt after a 1-0 defeat of Middlesbrough. Ricardo Carvalho scored early but Boro's Afonso Alves should have equalised, twice hitting the woodwork. Arsenal arrested their league slump with a 3-2 win at Bolton Wanderers despite trailing 2-0 and having Abou Diaby sent off. The Gunners have 70 points. Liverpool are fourth after beating Everton 1-0. Derby County were relegated after their 2-2 draw with Fulham who also look destined for the drop. GERMANY Germany's top six suffered a collective bout of vertigo over the weekend, with none of them managing victory. Bayern Munich remain seven points clear with eight games to play, even though they needed a late goal from substitute Lukas Podolski, his first league goal of the season, to claim a 1-1 draw away to Bavarian rivals Nuremberg. Hamburg SV stay second after matching that result, 1-1 at home to Arminia Bielefeld, while Schalke 04 move up to third on 45 after they warmed up for Tuesday's Champions League clash with Barcelona with a goalless draw at Karlsruhe. Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen are a point behind them in fourth and fifth respectively following surprise home defeats. Bayer went down 2-0 against Eintracht Frankfurt, while Werder were shocked 2-1 by relegation candidates Duisburg. FRANCE Olympique Lyon stayed on course for a seventh consecutive Ligue 1 title by winning 2-1 at mid-table Valenciennes on Sunday. Lyon's sixth successive league win put them on 67 points from 31 games, nine ahead of second-placed Girondins Bordeaux with seven matches left. Bordeaux, fighting to hold on to second place for direct access to the Champions League, beat third-placed Nancy 2-1 on Saturday. Olympique Marseille kept alive their hopes of a top-three finish by winning 2-1 at Lorient in Sunday's late match. The former European champions, who had picked just one point from their last two league outings, recaptured their winning ways and stay fourth but close the gap on Nancy to three points. NETHERLANDS Klaas Jan Huntelaar scored his 28th and 29th goal this season as second-placed Ajax Amsterdam beat Heerenveen 4-2 to postpone PSV Eindhoven's championships celebration. The Eindhoven side, who face Fiorentina in the Uefa Cup quarter-finals on Thursday, were held to a goalless draw by NEC Nijmegen though still enjoy a five-point lead with three matches remaining. NAC Breda came from behind to beat Feyenoord 3-1 to move into third three points above sixth-placed Feyenoord. The number two, three, four and five will join a play off for a spot in the Champions League third qualifying round.
