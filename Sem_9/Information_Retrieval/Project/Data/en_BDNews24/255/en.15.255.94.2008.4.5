 Dhaka, Apr 5 (bdnews24.com)Awami League began a mass signature campaign in Dhaka Saturday for Sheikh Hasina's release, though party leaders vowed 'tougher movements' if their leader was not released. The Dhaka Metropolitan Awami League, who organised the two-week signature campaign, are also demanding a check of soaring prices, the lifting of the state of emergency and the holding of national elections. The Dhaka AL unit aim to collect 10 lakh signatures, to be sent to the chief adviser. Acting AL president Zillur Rahman, inaugurating the campaign at the Institute of Diploma Engineers, Bangladesh, said: "We will have to go for tougher movements in future if necessary." "The country's overall situation is very critical. Hasina can alone save us from such situation." "The wish of the government to kill Hasina slowly by torturing her will not be fulfilled. The triumph of truth is inevitable," the acting party president said. AL presidium member Abdur Razzak also warned the caretaker government: "Our leaders and activists are prepared. If you do not free our leader we will go for tougher movements." Referring to the campaign's other demands, fellow presidium member Suranjit Sengupta said: "The government's irresponsible comments on the food crisis at various times are making the current situation more critical. We do not want the country to turn to feud and conflict." Criticising the administration's judicial record, he said: "The government has deprived the courts of awarding bail. Justice can not be ensured if the power of the courts is taken away." He also questioned the legality of the proposed truth commission, and demanded that national elections be made the priority before all else. "Make arrangements for holding free and fair elections. The 'national government of consensus' may be formed later, but only after national elections," Suranjit said. Presidium member Tofail Ahmed also added his voice to that of other party leaders, vowing: "We will start our movement anew if Hasina is not released immediately." Addressing his remarks to the caretaker government, he said: "Don't make us your rivals. If you do, the result will be unfavorable for you." He asked the government to arrange for Hasina's treatment properly by releasing her. "We will provide every kind of cooperation." Acting general secretary of the party Syed Ashraful Islam expressed solidarity with the programme and its organisers. "The AL will expand the campaign across the country if necessary," he said. Presidium member Amir Hossain Amu thanked the organisers of the campaign for involving the people. "You must ensure your programme is successful by taking it to every house so that it touches peoples' hearts." Saying he hoped the AL chief would be released soon, Amu added: "We will not only get our leader back, we will come to power alongside her." bdnews
