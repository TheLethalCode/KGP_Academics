 ROME, March 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United are the best team in the world on paper but AS Roma can beat them even without injured striker Francesco Totti, the Italian's club's coach Luciano Spalletti said on Monday. The clubs meet in a Champions League quarter-final first leg in Rome on Tuesday in a repeat of last year's tie which United won 8-3 after a 7-1 win in the second leg at Old Trafford. "Manchester United on paper are the strongest team in the world, they have great players in attack and defence," Spalletti told a news conference. "But Roma have grown up and have matured since the 7-1 last year and we are in the right condition to get a result and go through. Leading scorer Totti is out with a thigh problem picked up in Saturday's 1-1 draw at Cagliari which kept second-placed Roma four points behind Serie A leaders Inter Milan. The captain hopes to be fit for the return leg next week. "I am very sorry Francesco won't be there but the group must know how to cope without its focal point, otherwise there wouldn't be the right winning mentality," Spalletti added. Montenegro forward Mirko Vucinic is set to stand in. United's fans have been told to be on their best behaviour and to use a shuttle service to reach the ground to avoid a recurrence of the clashes and knife attacks that marred both of the previous games between the teams at the Stadio Olimpico. Alcohol in the area has also been banned. Worries have been heightened after a Parma fan was knocked down and killed by a bus on Sunday following a spat with rival fans in the latest soccer-related death in Italy. Spalletti said he expected Roma fans to behave better than the past but also hoped they could make life difficult for in-form Premier League leaders United. "Playing at home in a full stadium will give us strength," the coach said. Roma midfielder Daniele De Rossi said United were beatable. "We have already beaten them once. Unbeatable teams don't exist. Unfortunately though we meet them in a moment of great form," he said
