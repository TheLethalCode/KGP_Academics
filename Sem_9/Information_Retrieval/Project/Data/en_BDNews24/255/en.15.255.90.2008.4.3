 BERLIN, April 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A radical German Islamist may be planning suicide attacks on German targets in Afghanistan, Focus magazine reported on its Web site on Thursday, and police confirmed they had issued warnings. The news weekly said the 20-year-old, identified only as Eric B., was suspected of having links to three men arrested in the Sauerland region last year whom authorities believed planned attacks against U.S. installations in Germany. A spokesman for the Federal Crime Office (BKA) confirmed the main points of the Focus report but declined to give details. "We have warned our national and international partners, and possibly endangered institutions, of terrorist activities by two people from the German Islamist spectrum," the spokesman said. Focus reported that as well as the German national there was also an Egyptian national involved. Focus said the BKA sent warnings and a picture of Eric B., who was believed to be currently in Pakistan, to the German embassy in Kabul. His photo had also been posted at German organisations in Afghanistan. Authorities were particularly concerned because the man spoke fluent German and might easily win his compatriots' confidence. His apparent targets were soldiers or policemen, but civilian organisations were also at risk, Focus said. Germany has some 3,500 troops in Afghanistan as part of NATO's 47,000-strong mission and politicians here have debated in past weeks whether Berlin should give in to allies' demands and send in more troops to help fight the Taliban. Unlike Spain and Britain, Germany has so far escaped a major Islamist attack at home but the publication last month of a video apparently showing Germany's first Muslim suicide bomber in Afghanistan, highlighted the threat. BKA chief Joerg Ziercke said the video risked radicalising Islamists in Germany.
