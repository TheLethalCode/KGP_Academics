 WASHINGTON, April 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pope Benedict will meet Jewish leaders in Washington and visit a synagogue in New York in acknowledgment of the feast of Passover, which begins during his U.S. tour this month, U.S. bishops said on Thursday. The pope, who visits Washington and New York April 15-20, will meet with 200 leaders of other religions on April 17 and will speak separately with Jewish leaders afterward, the U.S. Conference of Bishops said in a statement. The meeting is "to present to them a message of his cordial greetings for the imminent feast of Passover," said Msgr. David Malloy, the general secretary of the Conference of Bishops. The pope will visit Park East Synagogue in New York for 20 minutes on April 18, the bishops said. "By this personal and informal visit, which is not part of his official program, His Holiness wishes to express his good will toward the local Jewish community as they prepare for Passover," Malloy said. The Roman Catholic pontiff visited a synagogue in Cologne, Germany, in 2005 to pay tribute to Jews from the city who died during the Holocaust. It was only the second time a modern pope had visited a synagogue. The Passover festival, which begins April 19 this year, commemorates the Jews' escape from slavery from the pharaoh in ancient Egypt.
