Results from the late-stage study of Cordaptive suggest the problem was largely averted and could boost interest in HDL-raising therapy, Merck said. Although overall other side effects were similar among patients taking Cordaptive and Niaspan, those taking the Merck drug had elevations in liver enzymes -- a potential sign of toxicity -- and diabetics had to adjust their medicines due to an impact on their blood sugar. The results were described at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology in Chica
