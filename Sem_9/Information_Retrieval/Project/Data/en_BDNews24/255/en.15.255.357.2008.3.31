 Washington, March 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US Army has identified the remains of a soldier captured by insurgents in Iraq nearly four years ago, CNN reported on Sunday. Sgt. Keith Maupin, an Army reservist from Batavia Ohio, had been missing since his convoy, part of the 724th Transportation Company was attacked near Baghdad on April 9, 2004. His father, Keith Maupin, said military officials informed the family on Sunday afternoon that the remains of the missing soldier had been identified, the Dayton Daily News reported on its Web site. The newspaper said a three-star Army general delivered the news to the parents at the support center the couple run near Cincinnati, which aids service members and families. In Washington, Army spokeswoman Shari Lawrence confirmed the Maupin family had been briefed on Sunday. She provided no further details but said a statement would be released soon. CNN cited a Defense Department official as saying that the remains of the 24-year-old were found last week but DNA results has just came in. Three other U.S. soldiers are listed as missing in Iraq. Sgt. Alex Jimenez and Pfc. Byron Fouty were abducted after an attack on their patrol in Yusufiya south of Baghdad on May 12, 2007. Sgt. Ahmed Altaie, missing since Oct. 2006, was allegedly kidnapped while visiting family.
