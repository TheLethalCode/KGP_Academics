Besides, those who breach UK immigration laws by staying illegally or working without permission will be banned from entering the UK. The tough measures come into effect Tuesday across the globe including, Bangladesh as per the new immigration laws of Britain, the high commission said in a statement. "We advise applicants not to risk going through agents that offer to 'guarantee' a visa through fraudulent means or by providing false documentsapplicants doing this, risk losing an awful lot more than their money," Jon Verney, head of immigration services at British High Commission. "Legitimate Bangladeshi applicants have nothing to fear from these changes and I feel confident that they will understand and share our desire to stamp out fraudulent applications," he said.
