 BEIJING, April 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fresh rioting broke out in an ethnic Tibetan area of southwest China on Thursday night, leaving one official seriously wounded, state media reported on Friday. "The riot took place at the seat of the Donggu township government," the official Xinhua news agency reported. The official was attacked, the report said. Donggu is in Ganzi (Garze) Prefecture of Sichuan province, an area that has experienced intense anti-Chinese protests and riots since unrest broke out in Lhasa, the regional capital of neighbouring Tibet, in mid-March.
