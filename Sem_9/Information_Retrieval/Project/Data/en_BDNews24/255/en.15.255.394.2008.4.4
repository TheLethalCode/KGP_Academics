 BUCHAREST, April 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday he was encouraged that the United States had listened to Russian concerns about its planned U.S. missile shield site and said discussions would continue. "What is positive in today's dialogue is that our concerns about ensuring our own security ... have been heard," Putin told a news conference after meeting U.S. President George W. Bush and other NATO leaders in Bucharest. "The visit to Russia of the U.S. Defense Secretary (Robert Gates) and the U.S. Secretary of State (Condoleezza Rice) showed that our U.S. partners are thinking about measures to improve confidence and transparency and that work will continue," he said of a recent U.S. visit to Moscow.
