 Kathmandu, April 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nepal has banned the use of public and private transport for 24 hours to keep security tight during next Thursday's constituent assembly elections, which could lead to the abolishment of the once-revered monarchy. Many rebel groups in the southern plains of the country have vowed to disrupt the election, which is also expected to cement a 2006 peace deal with Maoists who ended a decade-long civil war and joined electoral politics. "Special passes would be given for the vehicles on urgent duty, including for the security personnel," the Home (interior) Ministry said in a statement on Sunday. Election Commission spokesman Laxman Bhattarai said the transport ban would prevent trouble makers from quickly moving between polling stations and would allow voters to walk to the polling centres without being disturbed. "We have arranged the polling centres in such a way that no voter needs to walk for more than two hours to vote," he said. The first national vote in nearly nine years, Thursday's poll could dump the centuries-old monarchy and turn the mountainous nation tucked between giants, China and India, into a republic. At least 135,000 policemen will be on duty to ensure security during the election, in the run-up to which at least three people have been killed and scores injured in clashes between political parties. There are 20,888 polling centres for 17.6 million eligible voters. More than 9,600 candidates from 54 political parties and independents are contesting for the 601-seat assembly. Officials said all results may not be known for two weeks or more because of the complex election procedure -- 240 members will be elected on a first-past-the-post basis and 335 through proportional representation, while 26 will be nominated by the cabinet. The government has declared a five-day national holiday from Monday to allow workers to return to their villages to vote. Hundreds of international monitors, including from the United Nations, European Union and the Atlanta-based Carter Centre, will monitor the election, authorities said.
