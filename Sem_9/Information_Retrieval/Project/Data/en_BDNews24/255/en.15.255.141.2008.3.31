 Dhaka, March 31 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court Monday sentenced BNP leader Khandaker Delwar Hossain's son Akhter Hamid Paban to 17 years in jail on twin charges of possessing illegal arms and ammunition. Paban's four accomplices were also jailed for 17 years in a sentencing by judge Md Shafiul Azam of Dhaka Metropolitan Special Judge's Court. The court sentenced each of the five accused to 10 years in jail for possessing illegal arms and another seven years for keeping bullets. However, the convicts will have to spend 10 years behind bars with the two sentences running concurrently, said Dhaka metropolitan additional public prosecutor Md Kabir Hossain. After the delivery of the verdict, when Paban was being taken back to jail, he shouted threats apparently at the judge: "Your children will face its consequences." Paban's sister Luna Khandaker, present in court, said it was an "unjust verdict". Four other convicts are: Paban's maternal cousin Nahid alias Mota Nahid, 20, Md Anwar Hossain, 30, Md Masud Ali Apu, 27, and Md Delwar Hossain Ratan, 19. All the accused were present in the court during the delivery of the verdict. After hearing the argument on March 27, the court set the date for delivery of the verdict in a case filed with Pallabi Police Station on Oct 30 by RAB-4 officer Md Enayet Ali. With the delivery of the verdict over, Paban's lawyer Gazi Touhidul Islam told bdnews24.com: "None of the 14 state prosecution witnesses in their depositions had said anything against Paban. So this verdict cannot be accepted." Paban's lawyer also said that they would file an appeal against the verdict with the High Court. The FIR said that Anwar, Apu, Delwar and Nahid carrying illegal arms with intent to snatch a taxicab were going to Ashulia by motorbike on Oct 30, 2007. On the way, RAB had arrested them near Pallabi embankment and seized a Germany-made revolver and five bullets from the gang. The arrestees alleged that the arms and bullets belonged to Paban, who was later arrested at Japan Garden City in Mohammadpur. bdnew
