 Mymensingh, April 5 (bdnews24.com) -- Nurul Haque Khan, the Niguary union BNP president, was brutally stabbed to death in a knife attack in the early hours of Saturday, police said. Family members, including Khan's two sons Mosharraf Hossain Swapan and Mozammel Hossain Ripon and daughter-in-law Mursheda, were seriously injured when they rushed to save their elderly father. The sixty-two year-old victim died on the way to Dhaka Medical College Hospital, where his sons and daughter-in-law were admitted for treatment of their wounds, said Gafargaon assistant superintendent of police Dewan Lalon Ahmed. Police have arrested two of Khan's neighbours, Awami League activists known as Russel and Sultan, on suspicion of murder, Dewan said. The assistant police super said the incident was related to maintaining "political control over the area". "A gang broke into Nurul Haque Khan's house in Patlashi village not long after midnight Friday," said Dewan. "The culprits then indiscriminately hacked Khan to death." "When his two sons and daughter-in-law came to save him they were also attacked with knives, causing them serious injuries," he said. bdnews24.co
