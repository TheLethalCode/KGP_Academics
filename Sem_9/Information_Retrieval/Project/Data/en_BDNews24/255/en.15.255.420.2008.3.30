<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 30 (bdnews24.com)Cracks found spreading along the western wall of the under-construction 'City Centre' in the Motijheel business district have not been caused by any structural faults, the building's developer said Sunday. Based on expert opinion, Dubai-based Belhasa Group Ltdone of the real estate developers of the projected 37-storey high riseannounced that offices sited in and around City Centre could be reopened for use. Belhasa project director KM Nurul Islam told reporters that after cracks appeared in the brick walls of two lower floors, a team of construction experts headed by professor Abdur Rouf from BUET's civil engineering department inspected the building. "After examining the damage, Prof Rouf said the building structurally sound and hence quite safe," Islam said. City Centre was evacuated Saturday, and offices in adjacent buildings were also closed, as safety precautions. The Belhasa project director said the cracks had developed due to faulty construction of the brick walls, which will be corrected soon. Quoting the experts from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Islam said the structural soundness would not be affected at all by the faults in the brick walls. Cracks started appearing along the western wall of the building Saturday afternoon. Eye-witnesses said the wall on the west side of the building was also leaning a little inward, and cracks were also seen in the brickwork of the building's front side, with some bricks having fallen out. Fire service personnel soon after evacuated the building, and cleared the site and its surroundings of hundreds of curious bystanders asking them to stay clear of the site. The road in front was also closed to traffic. Dhaka City Corporation mayor Sadek Hossain Khoka, visiting the site Saturday evening along with senior police officers, said that the building would be examined by a team of experts from BUET and the Army Engineering Corps, who were expected to submit a report following investigation Sunday. Islam told reporters Saturday: "Brick walls in a part of the building have developed cracks, which might have been caused by the recent quake." "But it's nothing to do with the building structure," he said, adding the structure was designed to absorb shocks of earthquakes measuring up to 7.0 on the Richter scale. Adjacent to the City Centre building lie the Uttara Bank head office, Janata Bank Tower, BCIC Bhaban and the National Life Insurance Company building. The western portion of the development houses a Standard Chartered Bank, HSBC Bank and a GrameenPhone Centre. The high-rise was designed to comprise 37 floors of office space, a convention centre, a business lounge, gymnasium, food court, recreational areas and a garage. It is being contructed by local developer Orion Group in partnership with the UAE-based Belhasa Group that constructed the 7-star hotel Burj Al Arab in Dubai. bdnews214.
