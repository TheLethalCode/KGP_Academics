 Moscow, April 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez may sign a contract for four Russian diesel submarines on a visit to Moscow next month, the Kommersant daily reported on Friday, citing unidentified officials. Chavez has been invited to the May inauguration of Dmitry Medvedev as Russian president. If he takes up the invitation, the Venezuelan leader may use the opportunity to sign a contract to buy four Kilo-class diesel submarines agreed at the start of this year, the paper said.

A spokesman for Russia's state arms exporter could not be reached for comment and the foreign ministry declined to comment. The paper said Venezuela also wants to buy 12 Ilyushin Il-76 military transport aircraft while Russia is interested in selling Caracas its new generation Sukhoi Su-35 fighters, which are still being tested. Venezuela is Russia's fourth biggest arms buyer after China, India and Algeria. Chavez, a socialist and fierce US critic, has made regular visits to Russia, the world's second biggest oil exporter, and has praised President Vladimir Putin for standing up to the United States. Russia is seeking to boost arms exports to Latin America as some of its traditional customers -- such as India -- express concerns over late deliveries and price rises for its arms. Some of Moscow's military technology has not been updated since the Cold War and it has been falling behind Western competitors, particularly in the area of electronics, military analysts say. The Kilo-class submarine, known in Russia as Project 636, has a submerged displacement of about 4,000 tons and is considered to be one of the quietest diesel submarines in the world. It carries a total of eighteen torpedo
