<TITLE> EC wants to fold up talks with BNP by April </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 31 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission looks to finish electoral reforms talks with the BNP by the end of April, an election commissioner said Monday. "We will hold the dialogue with the BNP as early as possible as we do not have time to spare," Mohammad Sohul Hossain told reporters. The commission would accept the court verdict, whatever it may be, he said. Earlier, Dr Kamal Hossain, lawyer for the commission, had met chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda in his office. The High Court is set to deliver a verdict in a writ petition on the EC dialogue on April 10. The EC was scheduled to hold the first round of talks with the BNP on Nov 22, as part of electoral reforms dialogues with political parties. But the dialogue was not held as BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia filed a writ petition with the High Court on Nov 18. The court stayed the invitation to acting BNP secretary general Hafizuddin Ahmed, nominated by the BNP standing committee, for two weeks and asked the EC to explain why the invitation would not be declared illegal. The commission had been set to finalise the electoral reforms laws in March, after the completion of dialogues with the political parties in September, October and November, in line with the roadmap declared on July 15 last year. The EC finished its first round of talks with 15 political parties except for the BNP and wrapped up a second round in February. bdnew
