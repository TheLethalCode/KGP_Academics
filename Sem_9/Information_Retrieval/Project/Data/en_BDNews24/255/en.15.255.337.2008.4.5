 Dhaka, April 5 (bdnews24.com) - Knitwear exporters asked the government Saturday to withdraw its decision to cut gas supply to factories by 40 percent, saying such a move could have serious long term effects on industry. Fazlul Hoque, president of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said the garment sector alone could count $1 billion in losses if the decision remained effective for up to two and half months as planned. Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company recently sent letters to all factories in Dhaka city and suburbs to cut use of gas by 40 percent from 6.00pm to 11.00pm, as demand for power increased with the onset of summer. The decision was supposed to come into effect from March 4. At a press conference in the city, Hoque said the decision would certainly threaten the garments sector in the long run. The BKMEA president told reporters that the association had sent letters to the chief adviser, army chief, finance, energy and commerce advisers and Titas Gas requesting them to withdraw the decision. "Garment exporters will fail to supply on time to buyers due to this decision of the government," he said. "As a result, orders will be cancelled and buyers will turn to other countries leaving the country's exports in trouble." Hoque said vested quarters had compelled the government to take such a decision, without holding any talks with exporters, in order to make the caretaker administration unpopular and destroy the country's garments industry. "Export in both woven and knitwear sectors will go down by 20 percent if gas use is cut by 40 percent. The sector exports garments worth $30 million everyday. Exports would fall by 20 percent, that is, daily losses of $6 million." "We are shocked at the government's decision," the BKMEA president said. "The country's economy is in trouble now. But growth of the garments sector has been good. The industry witnessed some troubles in the first quarter of the present fiscal year, but it shrugged off the troubles." He said most of the factories in the garments sector, including dyeing factories, ran on power from gas-run generators due to the electricity crisis. "Dyeing is a long process. It needs up to 11 hours to complete the dyeing of a knit or woven product." "If the process is halted in any way, the quality of dyeing is affected, and that is why generators are used to ensure uninterrupted power supply," Hoque said. Referring to the chief adviser's assurance just days ago to provide all-out cooperation to the country's exportersat the national export awards on March 31the BKMEA chief said the government itself is acting against the export growth. "It is unfortunate," he said. bdnews
