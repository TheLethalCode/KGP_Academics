<TITLE> Japan may keep Shirakawa at BOJ, opposition guarded </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Tokyo, April 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's government, racing to find a new Bank of Japan head before a G7 finance meeting next week, will likely nominate acting Governor Masaaki Shirakawa for the post in hopes of winning parliamentary approval, media reported on Friday. Opposition parties that control parliament's upper house and twice vetoed government nominees were guarded in their response to the suggested nomination, which may be voted on by lawmakers as soon as Monday. A third rejection by parliament would deal a harsh blow to Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda, who is struggling to keep his job as his popularity sags on doubts about his ability to resolve policy deadlocks in parliament. Failure "would be a further setback for any hope of recovery from the nightmare he's had for the past few months," said Gerry Curtis, a Japan expert at Columbia University. "Nobody looks good, but Fukuda would look worse." The Group of Seven (G7) finance heads, expected to meet in Washington on April 11, are likely to focus on efforts to contain the global credit crisis, and economists say the central bank should have a permanent leader at such a gathering. The Nikkei business daily said the government would probably tap Shirakawa, a former career central banker, for the governor's post and nominate Hiroshi Watanabe, a former vice finance minister for international affairs, as deputy governor. A senior lawmaker of the main opposition Democratic Party said he thought Shirakawa could be a good candidate, but he also said the party had not yet received an informal proposal. "I think he is capable of the job. But I also have to add that as a party we haven't made any conclusion," said Yukio Hatoyama, Secretary General of the Democratic Party. A senior ruling party lawmaker said the plan was to present the nominees to parliament on Monday, and Japanese media said informal sounding out of candidates had taken place. G7 COORDINATION SEEN NEEDED With central banks working together to stabilise volatile markets, an analyst warned that G7 leaders would not take the words of a stand-in governor seriously. The BOJ may not, however, have a permanent governor in place for its next rate review at a two-day meeting starting Tuesday, at which it is not expected to move rates. Investors are pricing in around a 20 percent chance of a rate cut by June from the current 0.50 percent -- to the surprise of most economists, who predict no cut this year. "Unless the Japanese economy slows sharply, Shirakawa will not be keen to cut rates," said Seiji Adachi, senior economist at Deutsche Securities. Shirakawa himself has shrugged off any label of hawk or dove, saying only that his views were not that different to those of the BOJ before his appointment as deputy governor. The vacuum at the top of the BOJ comes amid coordinated central bank action to settle gyrating financial markets, and as U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has conceded for the first time that the U.S. economy may slip into recession. The Fed has slashed U.S. interest rates by 3 percentage points since mid-September with markets expecting another cut this month. BUREAUCRAT WAR While both sides in Japan's parliament had vowed to avoid a vacancy when Fukui retired, a long-running argument over the influence of finance ministry bureaucrats derailed earlier nominations. Democrats, who would be keen to have a general election, rejected the previous two nominees on grounds that their past senior roles in the finance ministry would threaten the BOJ's independence in monetary policy. Some media and analysts questioned whether Watanabe, as a former bureaucrat, would win approval from the Democratic Party, but Hatoyama said the party was not necessarily against having a former finance ministry official as a deputy governor. The gridlock in parliament has also prevented the extension of a controversial gasoline tax that expired on March 31, pleasing consumers as petrol prices fall by up to 25 yen (24 cents) per litre but threatening to leave a big hole in government revenues. The arguments have taken their toll on support for Fukuda, raising speculation he may be dumped as prime minister. A survey by Fuji TV released on Friday put Fukuda's support rate at a slender 23.8 percent, well below the 30 percent level seen by analysts as necessary for his government to survive. ($1=102.44 y
