<TEXT>
 MADRID, March 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid dispelled any doubts that they can go all the way to claim a second consecutive Primera Liga title with their convincing 3-1 victory over Sevilla, coach Bernd Schuster said. The champions had lost five of their last eight league games before Sevilla visited the Bernabeu on Sunday, and had been well beaten by the Andalucians in three previous meetings this season. "It was a complete performance from the team. It was one of our most consistent displays," Schuster said after the game. Sevilla, who beat Real in both legs of the Spanish Super Cup at the start of the season and won 2-0 in the league at the Sanchez Pizjuan, were considered one of the leaders' sternest tests in the title run in. Real's players indulged in some exuberant celebrations after the final whistle but Schuster sought to play down the significance of the result despite them opening up a six-point lead over second-placed Villarreal, with eight games left. "It isn't a definitive result. We are in control as we have been for some time and we have to maintain this momentum to win the title," he added. "I don't care who our nearest rivals are. We are first and we don't need to look back." Villarreal replaced Barcelona as Real's nearest challengers with a comprehensive 3-0 victory over fourth-placed Atletico Madrid on Saturday, their fourth consecutive win, putting them second with 59 points. Barca slipped back to third with 58 after throwing away a two-goal lead to lose 3-2 at Real Betis on Saturday. Disgruntled fans shouted abuse at them during training on Sunday and Barca sports director Txiki Begiristain had a meeting with coach Frank Rijkaard. "I have asked for an immediate reaction and that we are on top of the players to ensure the side are fully committed for the Champions League quarter-finals," Begiristain told television station TV3. "We are at the critical moment of the campaign and we are all playing for our futures. We must continue fighting until the end of the season then we will make decisions.
