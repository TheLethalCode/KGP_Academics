<TITLE> China to sign landmark free trade deal with NZ </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Beijing, April 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China and New Zealand will sign a free-trade agreement (FTA) in Beijing on Monday, marking the first full trade treaty Beijing has concluded with a developed economy. New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark said the FTA would give her country's exporters increased access to the world's fastest-growing economy. "China is already our third-largest trading partner and a fast-growing export market for us," Clark said in a statement. Clark will attend the signing ceremony during a three-day visit to China at the head of a 150-member trade delegation. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao is also due to witness the signing. Trade Minister Phil Goff said New Zealand exports to China are projected to grow between NZ$225 million ($177.6 million) and NZ$350 million a year more than they would have done without the FTA, which will reduce tariff payments by about NZ$115 million. Currently major New Zealand exporters face tariff barriers in China of between 10 percent and 20 percent, he said. "Given that New Zealand is ranked 50th in size for Chinese exports, not to have achieved an early agreement with China could well have resulted in New Zealand being much further down the list for negotiations, and New Zealand exporters being in a position of disadvantage against competitors," Goff said. China and New Zealand launched the free trade negotiations in December 2004. Two-way trade between New Zealand and China totalled NZ$7.5 billion in 2007, up 10 percent on the previous year. The agreement covers not just merchandise trade but also services. China sends more students to study in New Zealand than any other country and is its fourth-largest source of tourists.
