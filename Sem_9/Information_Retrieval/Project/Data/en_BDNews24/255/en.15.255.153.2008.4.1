 London, April 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British support services company Babcock International Group Plc said on Tuesday results for its year to end-March 2008 would meet its expectations after satisfactory fourth-quarter trading. The biggest supplier of services to Britain's Royal Navy also said in a statement it was "confident that the manufacturing contracts for the CVF (Future Aircraft Carrier) will be signed shortly". It said talks with Britain's Ministry of Defence relating to "submarine support continue to progress, although we would not expect these to be concluded until the second half of the calendar year". Last May, Babcock, which already owned the Faslane submarine base and Rosyth naval dockyard in Scotland, agreed to buy Devonport, a dockyard which refuels nuclear submarines, from U.S. group KBR Inc, Britain's Weir Group and Balfour Beatty. Babcock said its rail division had "improved its performance significantly and has traded profitably throughout the second half". Babcock is one of four track renewal contractors for Network Rail, which has cut the number from six to improve efficiency. Babcock said it was to combine its civil nuclear activities in a separate division as "this market holds significant opportunities for us". Its shares, which have outperformed the support services sector by 82 percent over the past 12 months, closed at 571.5 pence on Monday, valuing the business at 1.32 billion pounds.
