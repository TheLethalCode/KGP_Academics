 Dhaka, Apr 5 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladeshis residing and working abroad have pressed the government to provide them with voting rights and national identity cards for the upcoming elections. The demand came at a press conference Saturday organised by a committee of Bangladeshi expatriates at Dhaka Reporters' Unity in the city. Abu Sayeed Khan, who lives and works in Italy, said: "We are citizens of Bangladesh, though we have to live overseas for work. We want the right to vote and national identity cards." "This is our constitutional right," he added. Sayeed said two election commissioners M Sakhawat Hussain and Muhammed Sohul Hussain, during a recent UK trip, assured non-resident Bangladeshis in that country that they would get the opportunity to be voters. "There are a lot of Bangladeshis in many countriesin Europe, the US and Australia. Why should they be deprived of their voting rights?" Sayeed asked. He hoped the government and the Election Commission would consider the matter and begin the process of allowing expats and NRBs to vote. bdnews24
