<TITLE> Portugal approves third bridge across Tagus </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LISBON, April 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Portugal approved construction of a third bridge across the river Tagus in Lisbon on Thursday, in an investment set to reach 1.7 billion euros ($2.7 billion). The road and rail bridge, which should be complete in 2013, will serve a new Lisbon international airport planned for the south bank of the Tagus and will carry trains on a new fast-speed line that will eventually reach Madrid. The bridge and the airport project could give a shot in the arm for Portugal's construction sector, which has been in the doldrums for several years, and benefit companies such as Mota-Engil and motorway operator Brisa . Transport Minister Mario Lino said an environmental impact study will be launched in May, while the contest to win the contract to build the bridge should be launched in November. The bridge would dramatically change Lisbon's panorama as it would extend over the Tagus River delta at its widest point.
