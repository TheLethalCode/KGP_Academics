 AMSTERDAM, April 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The UN war crimes tribunal will deliver its verdict on Thursday in the trial of Kosovo's former Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj, charged with torturing and murdering Serbs to drive them out of the region. Prosecutors are seeking a prison sentence of 25 years for Haradinaj, 39, a Kosovo Albanian commander of the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), as well as for his two co-accused, also senior KLA figures during the 1998-99 war with Serb forces. Haradinaj, his uncle Lahi Brahimaj, and Idriz Balaj, the commander of the KLA's "Black Eagles" special unit, have pleaded not guilty to charges of torture, murder, rape and deportation. Prosecutors said Haradinaj, considered a hero by many Kosovo Albanians, kept a tight control over his guerrilla force and subjected any perceived collaborators among the local population to brutal treatment. "There was a saying: 'God in heaven, Haradinaj on earth'," prosecutor David Re said when he summed up his case in January. The former nightclub bouncer resigned as Prime Minister in 2005, a post he held for only a matter of months, after being indicted by the UN tribunal. During the trial prosecutors said Haradinaj led a campaign to drive Serbs and Roma from their villages, with those left behind killed and tortured. They alleged that KLA forces had used a lake and canal area as an execution ground, dumping the bodies of their civilian victims. Investigators recovered at least 31 bodies. Others were tortured at a makeshift prison camp, where many died as a result of their injuries. "Haradinaj, Balaj and Brahimaj participated enthusiastically in the joint criminal enterprise, and are guilty of crimes against humanity including persecution and murder" prosecutors said in a final brief to the court. Throughout the trial prosecutors reported witness intimidation which led to two key witnesses refusing to testify. Haradinaj's defence lawyers, who did not present a case but submitted a document to the court, said the soldier-turned-politician had fought an honourable war, targeting combatants not civilians. "The Prosecution has not proved his personal participation in any of the crimes alleged. Nor has the prosecution proved that he ordered, authorised or condoned any of these crimes," they wrote. Haradinaj is the most senior former KLA guerrilla to be indicted over the war and the case has been closely followed in Kosovo. Kosovo's 90 percent Albanian majority declared independence in February. Serbia's former province has been run by the United Nations since a 1999 NATO air war to halt Serb ethnic cleansing forced the pullout of Serb forc
