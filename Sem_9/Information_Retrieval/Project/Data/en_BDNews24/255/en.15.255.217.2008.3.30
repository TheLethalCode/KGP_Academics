 NAJAF, Iraq March 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraqi Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr called on his followers on Sunday to stop battling government forces, seeking to stamp down violence in towns and cities that has threatened to spiral out of control. "Because of the religious responsibility, and to stop Iraqi blood being shed ... we call for an end to armed appearances in Basra and all other provinces," Sadr said in a statement given to journalists by his aides in the holy Shi'ite city of Najaf. "Anyone carrying a weapon and targeting government institutions will not be one of us," the statement said. A crackdown on Sadr's followers in the southern oil port of Basra has sparked an explosion of violence in Iraq's south and in Baghdad that risks undoing recent improvements in Iraq's fragile security and jeopardising U.S. plans to withdraw troops.

Maliki launched the military operation last Tuesday, vowing to reassert his government's control over Iraq's second city, which is dominated by various militias.

The operation has sparked a furious backlash from Sadr's Mehdi Army militia, who believe Maliki and the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council, his most powerful Shi'ite ally, are trying to crush them ahead of provincial elections due in October.

US President George W Bush has lauded the operation in Basra as Iraqi-led and planned, but there are signs that the US-British coalition is being drawn deeper into the conflict. US special forces are operating in Basra alongside Iraqi troops, the US military confirmed on Sunday. British forces, who pulled out of the city last year, also moved in closer to its outskirts. A British spokesman said there were no plans yet for British ground forces to re-enter Basra. British forces backed up the Iraqi government troops with artillery on Saturday for the first time since the operation began, military spokesman Major Tom Holloway said on Sunday. Britain handed over Basra, whose oil fields are the source of most of the Iraqi government's revenues, to Iraqi control last year but still has 4,100 troops on a base outside the ci
