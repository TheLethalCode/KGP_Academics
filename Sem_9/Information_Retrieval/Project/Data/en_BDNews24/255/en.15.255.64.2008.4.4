<TEXT>
 TOKYO, April 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japanese and Euro zone finance ministers called for G7 finance leaders meeting next week to seek a curb on excessive exchange-rate movements, amid growing concern over the economic effects of a sliding dollar. "It is important for the G7 members to confirm their shared understanding that excessive foreign exchange rate moves are undesirable for economic growth," Japanese Finance Minister Fukushiro Nukaga told reporters on Friday, when asked whether the dollar's broad downtrend would be discussed at the G7 meeting. The dollar tumbled to an all-time low of 1.59 per euro and to a 13-year low below 96 yen last month on fears the US economy, battered by an ailing housing market and a deeply wounded banking sector, would enter a recession. It has bounced back somewhat to around 1.5655 to the euro and 102.35 against the yen on Friday, but has still fallen nearly 6 percent on a trade-weighted basis in the past month -- raising fears in Europe and Japan that businesses will lose out to cheaper rivals trading in US dollars. "Our concern is well-known, we don't like excessive volatility and disorderly rate moves, they are harming worldwide economic growth and we will stick to that line," Eurogroup chief Jean-Claude Juncker told reporters late on Thursday. Ministers from the 15 countries using the euro and the European Central Bank, or the Eurogroup, are meeting in the town of Brdo, close to Ljubljana, to discuss the economy at a regular meeting and agree on their call to Group of Seven rich economies, which meet next Friday in Washington. Nukaga said the G7 finance ministers and central bankers needed to communicate closely to stabilise financial markets at a time global economic growth appears to be slowing. The G7 has said in past meeting communiques that excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates were undesirable. Markets watch communique wording on exchange rates closely, because all G7 members agree on the phrasing, so it could give the first signal of a deal on concerted action in foreign exchange markets. European countries have been vocal in expressing concern over the euro's sharp rises against the dollar as such moves would hurt the competitive advantage of the region's exports. French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said on Thursday that the current situation in the currency market was "painful" for euro zone economies. Japan's growth also relies heavily on exporters, with Sony Corp, the maker of PlayStation game machines, saying on Thursday that each one yen rise against the U.S. dollar cost the company about $59 million. But big Japanese manufacturers have not complained much about the stronger yen and monetary authorities in Tokyo have largely taken a hands-off approach, partly because the nation's exports have continued to rise despite slowing U.S. growth. Nukaga toned up his warning against rapid currency moves when the yen spiked last month, saying that he felt the moves were excessive and that the ministry was watching with great interest. With the yen having stabilised, few market players expect Tokyo to intervene, but some warn against complacency. "I don't think Japan will intervene now but if the dollar falls below 90 yen, it would be a different story," said Satoru Ogasawara, an economist at Credit Suisse. "Policymakers are surely worried about the dollar falling too much. It's too early to rule out the possibility of intervention just yet," he said. Tokyo intervened massively in 2003 and early 2004 to prevent a rapid rise in the yen from aggravating deflation and derailing a fragile export-led recovery. But it has not stepped in since. The world's central banks are also considering new measures to ease the pain in money markets, Japan's Jiji news wire reported on Friday, without citing sources. The central banks of Japan, Europe, the United States and some developing countries were considering a system to allow a private bank in one country to borrow funds from another country's central bank if it had collateral set aside at the central bank in its own country, Jiji sa
