 WATFORD, England, April 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South African President Thabo Mbeki on Saturday said the situation in Zimbabwe was "manageable" and the international community should refrain from any intervention and wait for full election results. "No, it's time to wait," Mbeki said when asked if it was time for the international community to take action over the post-election crisis in Zimbabwe. "Let's see the outcome of the election results," Mbeki told reporters at a conference of "progressive governance" leaders hosted by Britain's Prime Minister Gordon Brown near London. "I think the situation for now is manageable. If there is a rerun of the presidential election let's see what comes out of that," added Mbeki, who is widely held to have influence over Mugabe. "Let's allow the election process to go forward." The opposition Movement for Democratic Change -- which says its leader Morgan Tsvangirai defeated President Robert Mugabe in a presidential election one week ago -- has urged the United Nations to intervene to prevent violence from breaking out. Armed police on Saturday prevented Zimbabwe opposition lawyers from entering the High Court in Harare to apply for an order forcing the release of presidential election results. Mugabe has signalled he wants to fight to extend his 28-year rule. Brown, speaking at the same conference, urged Zimbabwean electoral officials to publish the results without delay. He also said international observers must be allowed to monitor a rerun if there is one. "We are determined that of course there are international observers if there is a second round," he said. Brown and Mbeki will hold bilateral talks on Zimbabwe on Sunday, the prime minister said. Mbeki reminded journalists, however, that "Zimbabwe is not an African province" after repeated questions on the subject. He also said he believed Zimbabwe had followed all the pre-agreed rules and regulations throughout the election process. Concerns have been raised about vote-buying and rigging. "Essentially they have observed all the rules and regulations up until now. If there is a rerun, I don't see why they would not do it again," he added. Mbeki said "international observers" had monitored the vote and would undoubtedly monitor any rerun.
