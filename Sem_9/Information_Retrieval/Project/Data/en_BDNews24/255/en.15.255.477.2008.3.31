 MUMBAI, India, March 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian batsman Sachin Tendulkar will miss the second test against South Africa starting on Thursday due to a groin injury, the Indian board said on Sunday. The player did not take the field on the final day of the first test which ended in a draw in Chennai on Sunday. "Tendulkar has been ruled out with a groin injury," board secretary Niranjan Shah told Reuters. Tendulkar had declared himself fit before the series when many of his team mates were directed to report to the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore to undergo fitness tests. Mohammad Kaif has been named as his replacement. India captain Anil Kumble, who was also off the field in the final two sessions on Sunday, faces a final fitness decision on Wednesday before the test in Ahmedabad, Shah said. "I had a slight niggle while I was bowling and I didn't want to take a chance," Kumble told reporters. "The match was probably over by then. "It was important for me to ensure that I recover well for the second test.
