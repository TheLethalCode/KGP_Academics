<TEXT>
 Beijing, April 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Chinese court has jailed a senior police official for 12 years for providing explosives used in a car-bomb to kill a local lawmaker's mistress, local media reported on Sunday. In September, Duan Yihe, former Communist Party boss in the eastern city of Jinan, was executed for killing his mistress, Liu Haiping, and wounding two other people in a car-bomb attack after tiring of her demands for money. Beijing News said that Lian Dejin, former head of a criminal investigations unit in Ping county, eastern Shandong province gave a local policeman five detonators and about two kilograms of explosives to carry out the attack. "Lian Dejin's illegal delivery of the explosives had grave consequences, leading to the death of one person, (injuries) and damage to the car," the paper quoted the Jinan city court as saying. The policeman who planted the explosives in the car was executed last year, and a mechanic involved in the plot was jailed for life. China has seen a number of violent crimes involving corrupt senior officials in recent years, and has pledged to sack any officials found to have secretly kept mistresses.
