<TITLE> BA's Heathrow chaos enters day 5, revenue hit seen </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, March 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British Airways Plc cancelled more flights during a fifth day of chaos at its new airport terminal as analysts at Citibank forecast its revenue could be cut by up to 25 million pounds ($49.7 million). BA shares fell by as much as 5 percent after the airline scrapped more than 50 flights from Heathrow and investment bank Goldman Sachs put a "sell" rating on the shares. Nearly 250 flights have been cancelled since Thursday's troubled opening of the $8.6 billion showcase Terminal 5, with thousands of bags stranded in its vast underbelly following problems with the baggage system. Staff have struggled with parking, security and access to the terminal, which is the size of 50 soccer pitches and was heralded by BA as the best facility in the world. The high-profile opening has quickly turned into a public relations disaster and analysts say revenue will also be hit. "Based on daily revenue of 23 million pounds and disruption costs of 100 to 200 pounds per passenger, we estimate the earnings impact so far to be 15 to 25 million," Citibank analysts said in a note. On April 30, BA plans to move long-haul flights, accounting for the other half of its Heathrow passengers, to T5. Analyst Douglas McNeill at BlueOar Securities said the financial impact would be in the "low millions", but would cause the company to miss its long-term goal of 10 percent margins this year.

"They had been hoping to put the long-term problems of Heathrow behind them with this move and present Terminal 5 as a competitive advantage," he said. But investors have become accustomed to one-off dents to BA's revenue. Last year's results included an impact of 80 million pounds from a strike threat and 100 million pounds due to upheaval when police said they uncovered a plot to bomb transatlantic airliners. Citibank said that, despite the revenue impact, the firm's financial results may not be hit too hard due to the structure of its bonus scheme. "Most losses are likely to be borne by staff because it reduces the likelihood of a bonus (based on a 10 percent operating margin target) being paid." Rival airline Virgin Atlantic says it has seen around 300 first-class passengers switch across. BA said it was too early to comment on the impact but plans to announce its March traffic statistics on Thursday, at which point it would normally give some comment on the strength of future bookings. Goldman Sachs analysts changed their recommendation on BA shares to "sell" and cut their revenue forecasts on Monday, largely due to high fuel costs. But Heathrow still merited a mention. "On revenue its challenges are the UK consumer, weakness in the financial service industry, the increase in competition on North Atlantic (routes), the weakness in the US -- its most important long-haul market -- and the ongoing operational challenges of Heathrow," they said in a research no
