<TITLE> Egypt detains 28 Islamists ahead of council vote </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CAIRO, April 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Egyptian security forces detained 28 members of the opposition Muslim Brotherhood on Saturday in pre-dawn house raids in the run-up to local council elections due on Tuesday, security sources said. The raids are the latest in an escalating crackdown that has seen more than 350 members of Egypt's most powerful opposition group detained since Tuesday ahead of the vote, in which the Brotherhood is vying for seats against Egypt's ruling party. A Brotherhood spokesman confirmed the arrests, but put the number slightly lower at 26. He said the men, including two would-be Brotherhood candidates in the upcoming vote, were picked up across four provinces in the Nile Delta, where the Islamist group has a strong popular base. Security sources said the men were accused of belonging to a banned group and possessing anti-government literature -- accusations often levied to justify Brotherhood detentions but which rarely result in formal charges. U.S.-based Human Rights Watch has called the recent arrests a "shameless bid" to fix the upcoming elections. The Brotherhood said more than 500 of its members are currently detained. The Brotherhood says the government has obstructed attempts by its members to register as candidates. Egypt's Interior Ministry has repeatedly declined to comment on the accusations. Seats on local councils could be important for the Brotherhood on a national level if it wants to field an independent candidate in a future presidential election. Independent candidates for the presidency need endorsements from 140 members of local councils as well as support from members of both houses of parliament. Egyptian courts have issued hundreds of rulings in recent weeks obliging the government to accept the candidacies of Brotherhood members, but the group says authorities have ignored the rulings. The government says the Muslim Brotherhood is a banned organisation, but the group operates openly and holds a fifth of the seats in the lower house of parliament through members elected as independents.
