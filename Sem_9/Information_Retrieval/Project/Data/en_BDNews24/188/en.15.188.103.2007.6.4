 Sajjadur Rahman bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, June 4 (bdnews24.com) -- Time and money do not matter for the Annual Development Programme (ADP). Almost every project in the ADP spends more money and time than allocated. This increase reaches a maximum of 300 percent in expenditure and 750 percent in time. It may sound confusing, but it is true and has been reflected in a major government report released last month. Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED) of the planning Ministry has prepared the report on the field level implementation situation and stakeholders' opinion on 175 projects completed in the ADP for 2004-05. "Real expenditure has increased by a minimum of one percent to a maximum 300 percent for almost every project scrutinized by the IMED team," the report revealed. It sounds alarming when it comes to the time limit, which has been increased by maximum 750 percent from the original time allocated during the project approval. The report found performance of 66 projects or 38 percent of the projects satisfactory, while 88 or 50 percent of the projects more or less satisfactory. Performance of 21 projects or 12 percent of the total projects was disappointing. Local government and rural division performed the least. Only 20 percent projects of the division performed satisfactorily followed by communications ministry (22 percent). Of the 175 projects completed in the 2004-05 fiscal, 18 were from the communications ministry. "Only five of the communications ministry projects were completed within the original approved expenditure. The cost for the remaining 13 projects was exceeded by between nine and 100 percent," the report said. Planning ministry implemented five projects out of 175 that have been examined. But, performance of all of the projects was disappointing. The IMED report identified some problems as bottlenecks in the ADP implementation. These are: failure to determine the exact demand (money and time), improper estimation of prices, poor logical infrastructure, delay in project approval and weaknesses in administrative and financial skills of the implementing agencies of the projects. "Because of these problems, amendment is required either for time or money soon after approval of the project," it said. The interim government has announced a Tk 26,500 crore ADP for fiscal 2007-08, an increase of 23 percent from the revised ADP for the outgoing 2006-07 fiscal. An ADP consists of, on an average, 1,000 projects. Of them, between 150 to 200 projects are completed each year. IMED conducts assessment report on these completed projects. The interim government led by Fakhruddin Ahmed has recently directed authorities concerned to follow some directives, including a halt to frequent transfers of project directors, IMED officials said. bd
