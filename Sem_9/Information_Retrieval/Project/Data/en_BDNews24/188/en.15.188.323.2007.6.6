 ABUJA, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nigerian labour unions threatened on Wednesday to call an indefinite general strike over an increase in the price of fuel and urged Nigerians to stockpile food in preparation. The unions have set June 18 as a deadline for the new government to meet their demands to reverse the fuel price hike. They also want last month's doubling of the rate of Value Added Tax to 10 percent rescinded and the privatisation of two oil refineries cancelled. These measures were taken during the last days of former president Olusegun Obasanjo's tenure, just before he handed over to President Umaru Yar'Adua on May 29. Yar'Adua has yet to name his ministers or comment publicly on the fuel price increase. "The country may be in for a long-drawn battle with the executive to right a few of the wrongs perpetrated by the defunct Obasanjo regime," said Abdulwahed Omar, president of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) umbrella body. The unions also say a 15 percent pay rise for public sector staff announced in January has not been applied to most workers and they want government to pay arrears going back to January. The unions had already said they were considering a strike but Omar's language on Wednesday was stronger. He said the state branches of the NLC had been instructed to start mass mobilisation for protests and strikes across Nigeria. "From this weekend Nigerians should start stockpiling essential items like food and also carry out any bank transactions necessary," Omar told a news conference in Abuja. He did not say exactly when the strike would begin. He said the governing bodies of the NLC and of the other umbrella labour organisation, the Trade Union Congress (TUC), would meet to set a date after the expiry of their June 18 ultimatum. The two main oil workers' unions are members of the NLC and the TUC and they have said they would take part in any strike. Supply disruptions in Nigeria, the world's eighth biggest exporter of crude, have pushed up prices on international markets. Nigeria's output is already down by over a quarter because of militant attacks on the oil industry. Previous strikes have had a limited impact on oil exports, however, as compliance with strike calls is sometimes incomplete and companies have maintained skeleton staffing. The 15 percent increase in the pump price of fuel to 75 naira (59 U.S. cents) per litre outraged many Nigerians, who regard cheap fuel as one of the few benefits they receive from an ineffective government. But the government argues that with international fuel prices so high, the subsidies it pays to keep prices low within Nigeria are unsustainable. Despite exporting over 2 million barrels of oil per day, Nigeria has to import refined products because its refineries are not working. The Obasanjo government sold two refineries in its dying days but this prompted accusations of cronyism because both plants went to a consortium led by Aliko Dangote, a major financier of the ruling party. "The deal did not follow due process. It was completely wrong. We expect government to reverse it," said Peter Akpatason, president of the NUPENG union of junior oil worke
