<TITLE> IBM, China's Kingdee to seal global software tie-up </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 HONG KONG, June 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - IBM and Lehman Brothers have agreed to buy a small slice of software company Kingdee, kicking off an alliance intended to help the US firm expand its footprint in a $10 billion domestic market and further the Chinese company's global ambitions. Shares in Kingdee International Software Group Ltd, China's second-largest designer of software that helps run businesses more smoothly, leapt as much as 14 percent after resuming trade on Monday, following a May 28 suspension. But they retreated and were up 2 percent at midday. Under the terms of an agreement hammered out this year, Big Blue will help Kingdee re-design its products to suit an international marketplace, and provide consulting to its clients. In return, IBM - which will get 3.85 percent of Kingdee by paying nearly half what its shares were worth last week - gains access to a thriving market dominated by SAP, Oracle and local champion UFIDA Software. "The global alliance ... will put Kingdee on a higher growth trajectory by assisting it to approach the international market, and also associating the company in the domestic market with a strong brand name," investment bank CIMB wrote on Monday. As for IBM, CIMB suggested "their ultimate reason for entering the deal is to sell ERP consulting resources in China". China's nascent software market is projected to gallop ahead about 10 percent annually and account for almost a quarter of Asian IT spending of $48.37 billion by 2010, excluding Japan, according to IT consultancy IDC, as corporations and government offices overhaul operations. IBM and Lehman agreed to pay HK$132 million (US$16.9 million), or HK$3.7885 per share, for 7.7 percent of Kingdee, which closed at HK$7.03 before its suspension. That discount meant both firms, which would book on-paper gains, picked up the stake for close to nothing, analysts said. The deal "will raise the company's profile in the industry and in the professional investor community", Kingdee said. The US tech firm and Kingdee would begin cooperating on sales within China initially, before expanding further afield. China now hosts hundreds of homegrown software companies, most of them small and unheard-of outside local markets. SAP's chief operating officer told Reuters last year that a Chinese software maker could emerge in coming years as a more serious competitive threat than even Oracle. Kingdee, which SAP regards as its closest competitor within the world's fourth-largest economy, hopes to ride persistent growth at home while making forays into Southeast Asia and other overseas markets such as India or the Middle East. It hopes to expand revenue 30 percent a year till 2010 and post at least a quarter of sales from abroad by then, versus about 5 percent now, executives have told Reuters. Shenzhen-based Kingdee expects to nearly double overseas revenue annually over the next four years. To get there, it plans to start small in markets such as Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia - now fragmented and housing no single dominant player - before marketing its services in more mature arenas of Australia, South Korea and Japan. Bigger rival UFIDA's shares in Shanghai had slid almost 6 percent by midday, though that market was off 4.6 percent
