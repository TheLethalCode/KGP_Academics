<TITLE> Miners and pharmas weigh on FTSE amid China worries </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, June 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The FTSE 100 of Britain's leading shares fell on Monday as pharmaceuticals and miners weighed and stock markets geared for interest rate decisions throughout Europe later this week. Stocks also took their cue from an 8-percent slump in Chinese shares as investors continued to fret about last week's hike in stock-trading tax -- the latest move by authorities to cool a market that had nearly tripled in value in the past year. At 1102 GMT, the FTSE was down 0.4 percent. Pharmaceuticals took 5 points off the index and miners also took off 5.2 points as GlaxoSmithKline, a recently battered stock, suffered from uninspiring newsflow. Traders said miners were under pressure because of the gloom in commodities-hungry China. But some analysts said the market was just pausing for breath after gaining around 7 percent so far this year. "The market has had a sterling performance, it's probably due for a bit of consolidation anyway," said Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin. "China provides a good excuse for markets just to consolidate and buy time for a while." Markets were are also gearing for rate decisions from both the European Central Bank and the Bank of England later this week. While the ECB is widely expected to raise rates to 4 percent on Wednesday, economists do not expect the BoE to raise rates this month, but say that a surprise cannot be ruled out. The BoE raised rates to 5.5 percent last month and a Reuters poll published in late May shows there is a near one-in-three chance that British rates will hit 6 percent this year. Investors will also look at US factory orders for April due at 1400 GMT. Anglo American fell 1.4 percent after the mining firm considered a 3 billion pound ($5.9 billion) auction of its building materials division Tarmac, the Sunday Times newspaper reported. Elsewhere in the sector Lonmin fell 1.2 percent and Xstrata was down 0.6 percent. Xstrata said on Friday that it would not exercise its right to match Norilsk Nickel's C$6.8 billion ($6.4 billion) takeover offer for Canada's LionOre Mining International. In the pharmaceutical sector, GlaxoSmithKline was down 1.5 percent. Goldman Sachs said clinical results with Glaxo's new breast cancer pill Tykerb show only limited progress, while Bear Stearns views the new data as insufficient for an expanded label. Meanwhile, controversy over Avandia -- the safety of which was questioned in a New England Journal of Medicine article last month -- will return to the fore this week when a US congressional committee investigates the issue on June 6. Partygaming also fell 0.6 percent. The online gambling firm said it was in talks with US authorities following the recent spate of arrests of industry executives, after the US effectively outlawed Internet gambling last year. Bucking the trend, Royal Bank of Scotland added 1 percent after sources familiar with the situation said the bank put its Southern Water business up for sale for around 4 billion pounds ($7.9 billion). Reuters rose 0.8 percent after Lehman upgraded its price target on the stock to 660 pence from 550 pence. Vodafone added 0.4 percent after HSBC raised its price target to 200 pence from 170 pence and maintained its "overweight" rating. Among individual stocks, property firm Segro agreed to sell its US life sciences real estate business to Health Care Property Investors for 1.5 billion pounds ($2.9 billion) and to return to shareholders 250 million pounds of the proceeds. Its shares were down 0.1 percent
