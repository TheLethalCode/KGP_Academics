 Dhaka, Jun 6 (bdnews24.com)  The government has allocated Tk 900 crore for development programmes in local government bodies, finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said Wednesday. "Our past experiences about implementation of projects under annual development programmes were not satisfactory. We did not see timely realisation of most projects. Moreover, projects implemented did not bring about optimum outcomes," Islam said. Islam, who also looks after the commerce and telecommunication ministries, unveiled the ADP allocation for local government bodies a day before his budget presentation for 2007-08 fiscal year, the first full fledged budget by an interim government. The government has allotted Tk 26,500 crore in the ADP for the fiscal 2007-08. Talking at a district commissioners' conference at the Chief Adviser's Office, Islam asked the commissioners to implement development projects properly. He said that land acquisition ate up the bulk of time and money in the implementation processes as it related to a lot of hassles. "You must be aware of the difficulties so that you can succeed in timely implementation." The finance adviser also said that allowances to breast- feeding mothers of destitute children would be given along with the present ones such as elderly and destitute women allowances. Islam also said that subsidy in agriculture had increased to minimise farmers' sufferings due to energy price hike. Noting inflationary pressure on the economy, the adviser said that the rice-pulse programme by the Bangladesh Rifles would be widened further. The BDR would be given financial support to allow them procure food items both from local and international market, he said. "Be alert to ensure uninterrupted supply of commodities," he said. bdnews24.
