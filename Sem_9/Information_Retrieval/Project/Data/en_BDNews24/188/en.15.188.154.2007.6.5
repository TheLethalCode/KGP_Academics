 Dhaka, June 5 (bdnews24.com) The Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI) Tuesday welcomed the National Board of Revenue's move to allow people to legalise untaxed money by July 31. Briefing newsmen after a meeting with National Defence College cadets, FBCCI president Mir Nasir Hossain explained that the misrule the country had witnessed for the last few years failed to encourage citizens to pay taxes even on legally-earned wealth. People have to pay only 5 percent tax in penalty in addition to the normal tax rate to legalise honestly earned money, according to the NBR decision. The FBCCI welcomed the circular introducing the rare opportunity, Nasir said. "Of course, the NBR circular excludes ill-gotten or black money from the purview of this new provision," he said. On the commerce ministry's restriction imposed on candidates contesting the forthcoming FBCCI elections, the federation president said they are consulting legal experts and will soon convene a meeting to discuss the issue. Nasir said NDC delegates' visit to the FBCCI was routine. They discussed the economy, the prices of commodities and good governance, he added. The FBCCI is working with the government in the nationwide campaign to control the rising prices of commodities, Nasir said. He said the world is faced with food and commodity scarcities at the moment and that the present national crisis has to be overcome through implementing a combined strategy, he said. A 47-member NDC team led by Lt Gen ATM Zahirul Alam met the FBCCI members Tuesday. bdnews24.c
