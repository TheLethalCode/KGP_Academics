 TOKYO, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's fertility rate edged off a record low last year as the economy improved, but the population was still set for a decline as the proportion of elderly people increased, the health ministry said on Wednesday. The fertility rate, or the average number of children a woman bears in her lifetime, stood at 1.32 in 2006, up for the first time in six years and off a record low of 1.26 in 2005.
