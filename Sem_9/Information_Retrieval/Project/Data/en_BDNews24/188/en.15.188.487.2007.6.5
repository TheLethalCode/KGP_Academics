 LONDON, June 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Europe's biggest mobile phone retailer, Carphone Warehouse, posted annual pretax profit beating the average market forecast on Tuesday and gave a positive outlook, sending its shares to a three-month high. The UK-based group reported pretax profit of 123.1 million pounds ($245 million), above the average market forecast of around 116 million but down 9.5 percent on a year earlier because of start-up losses of 80.5 million pounds associated with its broadband rollout in Britain and investments in France. Sales rose 31 percent to 3.99 billion, above the average market forecast of 3.96 billion, and Carphone announced a 30 percent increase in its annual dividend to 3.25 pence a share. Chief Executive and founder Charles Dunstone said his group had "substantially addressed" the customer-service issues that have dogged its broadband business since its launch last year and forced it to miss performance and financial targets. "Demand continues to be strong and customer confidence in the service is increasing," he said in a statement, as the group reported, as expected, losses of 72 million pounds in its broadband business. Analysts said the economics of the broadband business, where Carphone is rolling out a fully unbundled network in the UK that will spare it from reselling main rival BT Group's wholesale broadband products, remained compelling. "We believe that last year's loss of 72 million pounds from broadband could be turned into a profit of close to 200 million over the next couple of years," Numis Securities analysts said. Shares in the group, now Britain's number three residential broadband and fixed-line telecoms provider, raced to levels last seen in February and were 4 percent up at 315-1/2 pence by 0745 GMT, off highs of 317-3/4p. Carphone, an independent retailer not attached to any mobile network, said it was targeting 15 percent growth in subscription or contract connections next year, after they rose 17 percent to 4 million during the previous financial year to March 31. "We're just saying 15 percent seems a reasonable target ... We'll aspire to beat it," Finance Director Roger Taylor told Reuters in an interview. Carphone suffered a setback last year when one of its major and early customers, Vodafone Group Plc, stopped selling contract connections from its stores in the UK. Analysts say it is also being hit by the rising trend among mobile operators to try and lock customers into longer term mobile contracts. The group has sought to boost its retailing business by adding stores across Europe and is also taking its mobile retailing business model to the United States, where it has a joint venture with electrical goods retailer Best Buy. Taylor said Carphone planned to open 250 new stores across Europe this year, of which 50 were likely to be in the UK, and also announced plans to accelerate the store rollout in the US to 9-12 months from 18 months previously indicated
