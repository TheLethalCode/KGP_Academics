 Dhaka, June 5 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) plans to increase financial benefits to e players to make the National Cricket League, country's lone first-class tournament, more competitive. "We are planning to introduce match fee for the national league's cricketers, following the examples of neighbouring India and Pakistan," BCB vice president and chairman of the tournament committee Shah Nurul Kabir Shaheen said at the prize- giving ceremony of the 8th NCL at a city hotel Tuesday. "Pakistan pays a player RS 6,000 for playing a match in the Quaid-e-Azam tournament and our amount will be no less than Taka 5,000,' said the BCB official. The cricketers, especially the national players, often show their reluctance to take part in the national league matches, reportedly for having little financial benefits. Last year the BCB paid a player a total of Taka 800 as daily allowance and Take 500 as traveling allowance, which, the players said, are not enough. "The BCB officials said they are aware of the problem and planning to raise the daily allowance to Taka 1, 500 from 8,00 and the travel allowance at a reasonable level,' said Shaheen. The tournament committee chairman also reiterated that the board would not accept any excuse from the national cricketers about their unwillingness to play the national league. "They (national cricketers) must play the national league and we would not accept any excuse. They must submit the medical certificates if they want to refrain from the matches due to illness," said Shaheen. BCB president M Abdur Aziz also emphasied the need for increasing the standard of the national league. "We must increase the standard of the national league if we want to take the cricket ahead. It is the source of grooming the players for the Test arena," said the BCB boss. BCB general secretary Mahbub Anam told the reporters that they would know the name of Dav Whatmore's successor in the month of June. "We are hoping that we would be able to know the name of the head coach of the national team in June. We are looking at Sri Lanka when the Lankan board announces the name of their new coach. In these case, it would be easy for us to find out the coach for Bangladesh," said Anam. In the 8th National Cricket League, Dhaka emerged champions in both one-dayer and four-dayer and received a total of Taka 3,00,000 while Rajshahi became runners-up in both versions of games to get 1,50,000. Alok Kapali of Sylhet was named best all-rounder in both one-day and four-day version matches. He scored 294 runs and took seven wickets in one-dayer and made 744 runs and grabbed 24 wickets in the four-dayer. Ariful Haq (Barisal) was the best one-day wicket-taker with eight wickets in four matches while Sabbir Ahmed (Chittagong) was the best four-dayer wicket taker with 53 wickets in 15 matches. Dhiman Gosh (Chittagong) was the best one-day run-getter with 324 runs while his teammate Gazi Salahuddin was the best four-day run-getter with 791 runs. Rakibul Hasan, who first cracked a triple century in first-class match, was adjudged best as an emerging player with 499 runs in four-day matches and 267 runs in one-day games. bdn
