 LONDON, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's PV Crystalox Solar, which makes silicon products for solar panels, priced its shares at 130 pence in a listing on the London Stock Exchange, giving it a market value of around 542 million pounds ($1.1 billion). The company plans to raise around 49.5 million pounds from an initial public offering. PV Crystalox is using the money to set up a polysilicon production plant in Germany, which will cost an estimated 80 million euros, the company told Reuters last month. Growing concerns about global warming have boosted demand for solar electricity and have led to a bottleneck in silicon supplies, the chief executive of the Oxford-based firm said. Conditional dealing of its shares will start on Wednesday, but admission to the official list and unconditional dealing are expected to start on June 11, the firm said. JP Morgan Cazenove is the sponsor, financial adviser and sole bookrunner, while Jefferies International is co-lead manager for the global offer, the firm said
