 NAHR AL-BARED, Lebanon, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Al Qaeda-inspired militants in north Lebanon threatened on Wednesday to take their fight to other parts of Lebanon and beyond if the Lebanese army did not stop attacking a Palestinian refugee camp. "If the army continues to bomb civilians and pursue its inhumane practices... we will move within the next two days to the second phase of the battle," Fatah al-Islam military commander Shahin Shahin told Reuters by telephone from Nahr al-Bared camp. "We will show them the capabilities of Fatah al-Islam, starting with Lebanon and then moving to the whole of Greater Syria," he said, using a term intended to include what is now Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian territories. Lebanese troops fired artillery and tank shells overnight and in the morning at Fatah al-Islam militants holed up in the coastal Nahr al-Bared camp, the 18th day of battles there. At least 114 people, including 46 soldiers and 38 militants, have been killed since fighting erupted on May 20. The army says the militants started the conflict and demands their surrender. The battles are Lebanon's deadliest internal conflict since the 1975-1990 civil war. In south Lebanon, a 40-member force from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah group and three Islamist factions deployed at the northern entrance of Ain al-Hilweh camp, scene of deadly clashes this week between the army and the militant Jund al-Sham group, which has links to Fatah al-Islam. The Ain al-Hilweh fighting, in which two soldiers and two militants died, raised concern that the conflict in the north could spill over to refugee camps elsewhere in the country. The Lebanese government said Fatah al-Islam had ordered Jund al-Sham to start the fighting in the south. Palestinian factions, including Fatah and the Islamist Hamas group, oppose Fatah al-Islam, which shares al Qaeda's ideology of global jihad and recruits fighters from other Arab countries. About 27,000 of Nahr al-Bared's 40,000 refugees have fled, many of them to the nearby Beddawi camp. UNRWA, the U.N. agency that cares for Palestinian refugees, has launched an appeal for $12.7 million to meet the urgent needs of the displaced. The Beirut government said the United States, which sent ammunition and other equipment to the army after the conflict started, had donated $3 million to help the displaced. A 1969 agreement prevents the army from entering Lebanon's 12 camps, home to about half its 400,000 Palestinian refugees. The violence is the latest jolt to stability in Lebanon. Four bombs have exploded in the Beirut area, killing one person and wounding dozens, since the Nahr al-Bared fighting began. A small bomb was found near a beach resort popular with UN peacekeepers in south Lebanon on Wednesday morning, security sources said. They said the 2 kg (4.4 pound) charge had been timed to go off at 6 a.m. (0300 GMT) but failed to detonate. Fatah al-Islam last week accused the 13,000-strong UN force, which has a naval component, of shelling Nahr al-Bared from the sea, a charge denied by the peacekeepe
