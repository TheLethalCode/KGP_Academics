 Dhaka, June 06 (bdnews24.com)  The deputy commissioners (DC) fear their magisterial powers may wane if the judiciary is separated from the executive. They told the inaugural session of a conference at the Cabinet Division Wednesday that they would have trouble running administrations. Communications adviser MA Matin, education adviser Ayub Quadri and agriculture adviser CS Karim exchanged views with the DCs. One DC posted in a northern district told reporters that the DCs should have the powers to deploy paramilitary BDR and other law-enforcing agencies urgently without having to seek approval from the home ministry. Currently, DCs need the home ministry's clearance for doing so. Meeting sources said the DCs asked the home secretary to amend the jail code allowing them to release prisoners now languishing in jails for minor offence. They said the jails were overcrowded and the DCs could not release the inmates serving for minor crimes. Home secretary Abdul Karim later told reporters that the police, RAB and the army-led joint forces have been instructed to shore up the communication networks with the local administration. He also underlined the need for district law and order committees to meet regularly. The home secretary asked the DCs to arrest the listed criminals and suggested deployment of more RAB members in areas where Islamic militants and left-wing terrorists were active. bdnews
