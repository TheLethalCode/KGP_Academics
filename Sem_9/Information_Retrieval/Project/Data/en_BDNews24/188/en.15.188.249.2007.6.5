 LUXEMBOURG/STOCKHOLM, June 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union's top court ruled on Tuesday that a Swedish law limiting the sale of alcohol breaks EU rules, though a bonanza for tipplers looked unlikely due to an earlier ruling. The European Court of Justice said the Swedish law that bans citizens from importing alcohol themselves to bypass a state-owned monopoly known as Systembolaget is unjustified as it blocked the free movement of goods, a basic EU tenet. "The prohibition of the importation into Sweden of alcoholic beverages by private individuals amounts to an unjustified quantitative restriction on the free movement of goods," the court said in its ruling. All alcohol in Sweden is sold by Systembolaget outlets. Swedish Finance Minister Anders Borg said restrictions on alcohol sales would remain despite the court ruling and that he was confident the government would preserve its tax revenues.

The court said that Sweden's justification for the law to protect young people was unacceptable as it affected everyone. Anti-alcohol campaigners were dismayed. "It makes it easier for minors to buy alcohol since it becomes more difficult to control the buyer's age," said Sven-Olov Carlsson, head of a Swedish temperance organisation.

Under Swedish law, anyone who wants to import alcohol would have to do this via the Systembolaget, which could turn down the request. The court said this could not be justified. Sprit & Vin, an Internet-based retailer of alcoholic beverages, said on its home page that shopping for its products could be slow due to the large numbers of people visiting its Web site after the EU court's ruling. The ruling overturned a court adviser's opinion on the case. "Public health is the loser in today's decision on liquor import to Sweden," the country's Green party sa
