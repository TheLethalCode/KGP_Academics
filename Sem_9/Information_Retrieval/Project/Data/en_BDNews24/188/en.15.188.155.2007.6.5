<TITLE> Australia says not trying to 'contain' China </TITLE>

 TOKYO, June 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia's expanding defence ties with Japan and moves to bring India into security talks that already include Tokyo and Washington are not aimed at "containing" China, Australia's defence minister said on Tuesday. Brendan Nelson also said Australia was studying whether to take part in a US-Japan missile defence system aimed at rogue states such as North Korea, but that no decision had been made. Japan and Australia signed a joint declaration in March on security cooperation, Tokyo's first such agreement with a country other than its main security ally, the United States. Officials from Japan, the United States, Australia and India also met recently to discuss cooperation in the region. "We're happy to have quadrilateral discussions including India on issues that relate to a much wider variety of foreign policy, trade, and to some extent, security matters, but so long as it doesn't distract from the trilateral strategic dialogue," Nelson told a news conference in Tokyo. "We are not doing, nor are we interested in doing, anything that would be seen to be what others describe... as containing China," he added. "That is certainly not our objective in any of the things we are doing." Nelson and Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer will meet with Japanese Defence Minster Fumio Kyuma and Foreign Minister Taro Aso on Wednesday for "two-plus-two' security talks, the first such meeting since the March agreement was signed. The Japanese government and US Vice President Dick Cheney this year suggested widening "trilateral" security talks with Canberra to reflect India's growing importance, but China has accused them of trying to contain its growing strategic clout. "It is important for Japan to deepen exchanges with Australia which shares common values with us in the same region and is a friend of the United States," a Japanese Defence Ministry official quoted Kyuma as telling Nelson later on Tuesday. "I feel certain that cooperation between Japan, Australia and the United States will contribute to the regional and global stability." Australia and Japan are staunch US allies, but with China this year surpassing Japan as Australia's biggest trading partner, Canberra is keen to soothe Beijing's concerns. Nelson also said the planned introduction of three air warfare destroyers with Aegis radar would give Australia the option of deploying SM-3 ship-to-air interceptors as part of a mobile missile defence system, but no decision had been made. "Our position is that we support what Japan and the United States are jointly doing for a specific threat that might be in the region and in a very limited way we are studying what we might also be able to do in the future to provide assistance in that regard," he said. Nelson told Kyuma that Australia would help with Japan's efforts to secure understanding from Beijing that the missile defence system being developed jointly by Washington and Tokyo would not target any specific countries including China, according to the Japanese official. Nelson also took the opportunity to chastise global critics of Washington's policies in Iraq, warning of the danger to global and regional security should Washington turn isolationist. "It has become fashionable in some, in fact many, parts of the world, and even some parts of Australia, for people to criticise the United States," he said. "We are very concerned to say to people who criticise the United States that they should be very careful, because they may get what they wish for.
