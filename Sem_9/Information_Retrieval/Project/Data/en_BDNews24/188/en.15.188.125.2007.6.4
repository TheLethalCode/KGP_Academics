 Dhaka, June 4 (bdnews24.com)  Judge Ashraf Hossain has set June 7 as the date for the verdict on the case filed against Giasuddin Al Mamun by the Anticorruption Commission for the non-submission of a wealth statement by the deadline, it was announced Monday. A hearing on the case has been held, with Mamun's lawyers failing to produce the editors and reporters of the newspapers that published news of Mamun's arrest on May 31. Defending himself in the Special Judge's Court-5, Mamun claimed that his arrest was announced on May 29 approximately two months after he was actually taken into custody by joint forces. He explained that the reason he failed to submit the required wealth statement to the graft watchdog on time was that he was being detained by the joint forces. Mamun also claimed that he was threatened by the joint forces with the possibility of coming under 'crossfire'. bdnews2
