 LA PAZ, June 05 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Some are made with clay, others with colorful tin foil, and a few carved in wood. One includes human teeth, and two of the rarest were worn by revelers who often collapsed dead after days of dancing, drinking and sex. La Paz's Museum of Ethnography and Folklore opened a rare exhibition of masks on Thursday displaying two millennium of Bolivia's ancient and modern traditions of masquerading, which mixes indigenous and European culture and religious beliefs. "They represent the different faces of the soul. A way of becoming someone else," museum director Ramiro Molina said. Two masks, measuring about 3 feet 3 inches (1 meter) high, and weighing some 27 pounds (12 kg) stand out from the rest. Decades ago they were worn by the men chosen each year as Jach'a Tata, who sacrificed themselves to the Gods in a decadent ritual to bless the pachamama, or mother earth. The Jach'a Tata typically found death after dancing and drinking nonstop for days. "It's very likely that people have danced themselves to death wearing this very same mask," museum spokesman Edgar Pomar told Reuters, indicating a multicolor plaster mask of a big-mouthed, long-nosed deity dating from the early 1900s. Anthropologist Milton Eyzaguirre says the ceremony is still being practiced by Aymara Indians on the wind-swept Andean plateau, but there have been no reports of deaths since 1953. "It wasn't a bad way of dying. They got to spend several days being feted by virgins, and they got very drunk," Pomar said. The oldest mask on display is a flat piece of clay with scratched-on eyes and a hand-knitted headscarf, dating from 100 BC. But masks remain very much a part of modern ceremonial life in Bolivia. On Saturday some 30,000 people, many wearing elaborate modern versions of the museum masks, will parade through the steep streets of La Paz for the lavish Jesus del Gran Poder (Jesus of Great Power) religious festival. Some will dance in masks depicting the distorted faces of African slaves, paying homage to slaves brought by Spanish conquerors. Devil masks are worn for La Diablada, the central dance at the Oruro carnival in mid-March, considered once of the world's largest street festiva
