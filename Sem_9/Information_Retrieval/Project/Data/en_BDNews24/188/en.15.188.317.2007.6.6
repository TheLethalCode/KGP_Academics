 BEIJING, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An exhibition hall collapsed in southwest China on Wednesday injuring 20 people, two seriously, a government official said. The former agriculture exhibition centre in Leshan collapsed at around 7.20 am when at least 100 people, mostly old people, were inside to attend a lecture, Xinhua news agency said. "There have been no deaths," Xia, who works in the information section of the city propaganda department, told Reuters. "Two have been seriously injured but they are not in danger. The others have been lightly injured -- there are scratches, broken bones but nothing too serious." Xinhua said earlier dozens were feared trapped under the building. Leshan is a popular tourist destination 100 km (60 miles) southwest of Chengdu, the provincial capital of Sichuan province, and famous for its Grand Buddha, carved into a cliff face and standing more than 70 metres high. The exhibition centre, built in 1959, is largely unused but occasionally serves as the venue for old people's dances
