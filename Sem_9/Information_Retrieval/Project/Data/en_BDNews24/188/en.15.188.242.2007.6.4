<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 4 (bdnews24.com)  Former skipper Habibul Bashar retained his place in the Test squad for the Sri Lanka tour when selectors Monday announced a 15-member team naming Mushfiqur Rahim as a second wicket-keeper. The selectors also picked up one-day specialist left-arm spinners Abdur Razzak and dropped Enamul Haq Jr and middle order batsman Tushar Imran, who were in the Test squad against India. Uncapped off-spinner Mahmudullah Riyad, Aftab Ahmed, Tamim Iqbal, Tushar Imran and Farhad Reza will join the one-day squad after end of the three-match Test series. "Definitely, Bashar has been given the chance considering his previous record," said chief selector Faruque Ahmed at a press conference at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium Monday. New selector Akram Khan and Athar Ali Khan were also present. Newly-appointed captain Mohammad Ashraful had a meeting with selectors before leaving Monday morning for India to play Afro-Asia Cup cricket. Bangladesh are scheduled to leave for Sri Lanka on June 17 and will play their first Test on June 25-29. The second and third Test will be held on July 3-7 and July 11-15. "We thought the team needs a back-up wicket-keeper for Khaled Mashud in the three-match Test series in Sri Lanka and the opportunity went to Mushfiqur Rahim, who is also a proven middle-order batsman," said the former Bangladesh captain. "Enamul Jr didn't perform well in the home series and Abdur Razzak, who has been doing better in one-dayers, has been given the chance in place of Enamul," said Ahmed. "We always pick the squad considering in which country we are going to play. We also consider if there is any room for that particular player in that particular condition," he said on whether it was fair to drop middle-order bat Tushar Imran from the Test squad without testing him against India. "Besides, Mushfiqur has been included as a middle-order batsman, who would also be a back-up wicketkeeper," said Ahmed. The selection committee picked four specialist pacers, three specialist openers and two specialist spinners in the Test squad. About the inclusion of uncapped Riad in the one-day squad, Ahmed said, "We are trying to bring variation in the bowling department for four years and Riyad has been playing good cricket for the last four months at home and abroad." "The team will be benefit from Riyad's batting and fielding," he added. Asked whether Bashar would be in the one-day squad, Ahmed said, "It is too early to comment at the moment as the one-day series will take place one and half a months later." Only after the Test series will the team management decide which six players would return home, he said. Bangladesh will play the first one-dayer on July 20, second on July 22 and the final on July 24. Test squad: Mohammad Ashraful (captain), Mashrafee Bin Mortaza (vice captain), Habibul Bashar, Javed Omar, Mehrab Hossain Jr, Shahriar Nafees, Rajin Saleh, Saqib Al Hasan, Khaled Mashud, Shahadat Hossain, Syed Rasel, Mohammad Rafique, Abdur Razzak, Mohammad Sharif and Mushfiqur Rahim.
