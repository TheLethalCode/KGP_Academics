 Dhaka, June 5 (bdnews24.com)-The BNP has termed the case filed against party chairperson Khaleda Zia and other leaders for the August 21 grenade attack politically motivated and conspiratorial. The Jamaat-e-Islami, in a statement, also condemned the filing of the case. BNP joint secretary general Selima Rahman, in a reaction to bdnews24.com Tuesday evening, urged the authorities concerned to withdraw the "false" case after proper investigation. She condemned the filing of the case saying that its being filed after such a long time was completely motivated. "One must understand why a person has suddenly come up to file a case after so long," she added. A state minister of the previous BNP-Jamaat alliance government, Selima Rahman said that after the grenade attack, the then prime minister Khaleda Zia directed the administration to take stern action. The August 21 incidents were investigated. The Awami League did not cooperate with the administration in investigating the incidents even at that time, she said adding that the people could not be misled by such a false and fabricated case after three years. Jamaat secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mujahid in a statement protested and condemned the case in which his party ameer Motiur Rahman Nizami was accused. He described the case as vindictive and politically motivated. He said that during the alliance government rule, the Awami League for mysterious reasons, did not cooperate in the investigation of the case. Jamaat publicity secretary Prof Md Tasneem Alam in another statement said that when the present government has started an all out drive against corruption, the case was filed to divert people's attention. He hoped that the investigation officer would investigate the case fairly. bdnew
