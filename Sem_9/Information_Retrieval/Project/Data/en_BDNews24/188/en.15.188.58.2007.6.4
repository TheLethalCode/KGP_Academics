Girlfriend experience - a service provided by a prostitute that includes more personal activity, such as kissing, than provided traditionally by sex workers. POTUS - president of the United States Season creep - the gradual changing in the length of the seasons, as demonstrated by earlier flowering of plants, etc, thought by many to be caused by climate change.
