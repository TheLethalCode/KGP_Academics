<TITLE> Malta denies abandoning migrants at sea </TITLE>

 PARIS, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Malta's foreign minister has rejected suggestions his country had abandoned illegal migrants seeking to reach the European Union by boat. The Mediterranean island had gone out of its way to seek help for a boat packed with migrants, even though it had been in a zone under Libya's responsibility, Malta's Foreign Minister Michael Frendo told the le Figaro daily on Wednesday. Last week, 27 shipwrecked Africans spent three days clinging to tuna nets in the Mediterranean while Malta and Libya argued over who should rescue them. They were eventually picked up by the Italian navy. The incident led Franco Frattini, the EU commissioner for migration issues, to accuse Malta of failing to meet its international responsibilities to save lives at sea. "We have never abandoned any immigrants at sea. Malta has always carried out its duties rigorously and we have saved the lives of thousands of clandestine immigrants," Frendo told Le Figaro. "The Libyan authorities assured us three times during the day that they were going to pick them up themselves. Three times, this didn't happen," Frendo said. "The criticism has been too hasty, misinformed and badly directed." A French navy ship found 18 bodies floating south of Malta on Friday just days after the Maltese authorities said they had lost contact with a boat photographed carrying 53 Africans. Malta refused to allow a Spanish tugboat to land another 26 would-be migrants because they were picked up in seas that fall under Libya's responsibility. Spain agreed to take them in. On Saturday, a Maltese patrol boat recovered 29 migrants. Frendo said Malta wanted other European Union member states to share the burden when illegal migrants were picked up in a zone covered by a non-EU member. Each EU member should be assigned a quota of such migrants, he said. Malta would table a proposal at a June 11 meeting of EU interior and justice ministers
