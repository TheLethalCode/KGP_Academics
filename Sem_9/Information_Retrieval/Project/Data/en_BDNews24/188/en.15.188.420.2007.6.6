 LONDON, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British sweets-to-DVDs retailer Woolworths Plc reported a deterioration in underlying sales at its high-street shops but said profit margins had improved as it managed stock more effectively. Woolworths, battling cut-price competition from supermarkets and online retailers, said on Wednesday that like-for-like sales at its high-street stores fell 0.6 percent in the first 17 weeks of its financial year. This was down from the 0.8 percent rise reported after the first seven weeks. Woolworths, which runs around 800 high-street shops, said the deterioration was due to strong comparative sales in the same period of last year, when it cut prices to clear stock. "With our improved stock quality, such activity was not required this year. As a consequence, the gross margin rate in recent weeks has been substantially ahead of the prior year," it said in a trading update, adding it continued to expect full-year gross margins to improve by at least 100 basis points. The firm said it approached the second half of its financial year with "a degree of caution", with rising interest rates creating a challenging backdrop for consumer spending. It said total group sales were up 11.4 percent in the 17 weeks to June 2, with an early spring boosting sales of its Ladybird clothing range for children. The second version of its Big Red Book catalogue has also been well received, it said. Woolworths shares closed at 27-3/4 pence on Tuesday, valuing the 100-year-old group at 405 million pounds ($807 million)
