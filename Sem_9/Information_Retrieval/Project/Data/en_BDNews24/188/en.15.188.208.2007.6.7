 SINGAPORE, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tropical Cyclone Gonu waned further as it moved towards Iran through the Gulf of Oman, but is likely to skirt the Strait of Hormuz, a key shipping lane for oil shipments in the region, forecasters said on Thursday. Gonu is now classified as a tropical storm. It hit a maximum-force Category Five hurricane on Tuesday and downgraded to a Category One hurricane early on Wednesday. The storm's maximum sustained wind speed is now about 70 miles per hour (113 kph), a report posted on the US military's Joint Typhoon Warning Centre said (https://metocph.nmci.navy.mil/jtwc/warnings/io0207web.txt). "The storm will continue to weaken in an increasingly hostile upper level environment and dissipate below tropical cyclone intensity over land after making landfall," the US Navy said in its latest forecast. The centre of the storm is expected to hit land in southeastern Iran over the next few hours. Shipping and port sources said earlier that operations through the Strait of Hormuz continued without disruption, as the storm looked set to miss the major shipping channel. Gonu had forced Oman to suspend its oil and gas exports, ground its national carrier and shut down its international airport on the northern coast, where more than 2 inches (5.1 cm) of rain was reported to have fallen, more than half its annual average, said the Weather Underground Web site. Oil and gas exports in Oman remain suspended. Shipping and port sources were not immediately available for comment. Gonu will no longer be a hurricane-equivalent storm when it hits Iran. A hurricane-strength tropical cyclone had hit Iran in 1945, senior meteorologist Kevin Roth wrote on the company's Web site (www.weatherchannel.com)
