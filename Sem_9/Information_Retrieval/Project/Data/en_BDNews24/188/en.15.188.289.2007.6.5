<TITLE> 888 in talks with US over gaming clampdown </TITLE>

 LONDON, June 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - 888 became the second online gaming firm to say it was seeking reassurance from US authorities that it would not be prosecuted for taking bets in the United States before an effective ban there last year. 888 said on Tuesday it had started talks with the US Department of Justice. On Monday, larger rival PartyGaming said it was talking to the Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. Like PartyGaming, 888, which stopped trading in the United States after the law was passed, said it was too early to assess the likelihood of any particular outcome. The legality of Internet gambling in the United States was ambiguous for many years, but it was effectively banned last October when President George W Bush signed legislation outlawing financial payments for gambling. The threat of US jail time prevented British bookmaker Ladbrokes from buying 888 in April, while the legal uncertainty and fear surrounding the situation has so far stymied industry consolidation. Shares in UK-listed gambling firms, which saw billions of pounds wiped off their values in October, were broadly up by 0800 GMT, with PartyGaming up 1.2 percent and 888 up 1 percent. If 888 and PartyGaming get promises that they, or anyone that buys them, would not face the threat of jail, analysts say it could spark a rush of deals as online firms bulk up to improve profits or as traditional casino operators and bookmakers look for a quick way into the online world. It could also clear the way for firms to go back into the United States in future if the law is changed. A crackdown on Internet gambling by US authorities began last July with the arrest of BETonSPORTS Chief Executive David Carruthers during a layover at a Texas airport. Last month BETonSPORTS pleaded guilty to US racketeering charges and agreed to spill the beans in cases against founder Gary Kaplan and other co-defendants, including Carruthers. Kaplan pleaded not guilty last month. Carruthers and seven others have also pleaded not guilty to the charges. In March Sportingbet brokered a deal with the state of Louisiana to have charges of "gambling by computer" dropped against its former chairman, Peter Dicks. The two founders of payment processor NETeller also face up to 20 years behind bars, charged with handling billions of dollars in illegal gambling wagers and winnings. The two have yet to plead following a string of legal delays. BetonSports, Sportingbet and NETeller all took or processed bets on sports events, whereas 888 and PartyGaming offered gamblers only casino games such as poker, defining them as a game of skill rather than chance. The confusion stems from the interpretation of the 1961 US Wire Act, which outlaws taking bets on games of chance over a telephone wire across state borders but does not specifically refer to games of skill
