A total of 127 US soldiers were killed in May, the third-highest monthly total behind November 2004, when 137 were killed, and April the same year when another 135 died. Nine have died in the first two days of June. A total of 3,487 soldiers have died since the invasion to topple Saddam Hussein began in March 2003.
