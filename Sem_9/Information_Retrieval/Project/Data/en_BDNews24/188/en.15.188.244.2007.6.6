<TITLE> Flintoff criticism blown out of proportion - Vaughan </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England captain Michael Vaughan said on Wednesday his comments over all-rounder Andrew Flintoff's behaviour at the World Cup have been "blown out of all proportion". Vaughan said Flintoff's drunken antics in the West Indies, where he had to be rescued from a capsized pedalo boat, had upset team spirit. The Lancashire player was stripped of the vice-captaincy after the "Fredalo" incident. England were eliminated at the Super Eights stage of the World Cup, failing to reach the semi-final. "I'll be seeing him later on for dinner, you know me and Freddy are good mates... it's been blown out of all proportion," Vaughan told Sky Sports News, a day before England face West Indies in the third test at Old Trafford. "It's a great story, it kept you guys busy yesterday. It's a bit baffling how it's ended up like this, just one word which I didn't say in a piece has changed the whole complex of a build up for a test match." Lancashire chief executive Jim Cumbes waded into the furore by branding Vaughan comments as "out of order" and "despicable". "I think it stinks," Cumbes told the Guardian newspaper. Vaughan conceded Flintoff would "not be best pleased" by the headlines. "The headlines were quite startling for what I said... and if there is anyone to blame for the World Cup demise it is Michael Vaughan, not Andrew Flintoff," added Vaughan. "But I've never pinpointed any one player before and never will do as an England cricket captain, it's something I totally disagree with, and as I said it's been blown out of all proportion." Flintoff is recovering from surgery and may be out of action most of the home season. England are 1-0 up after two tests of a four-match series against West Indies
