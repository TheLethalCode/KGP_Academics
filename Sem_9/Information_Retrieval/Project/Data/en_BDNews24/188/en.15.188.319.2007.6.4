<TITLE> Govt delays power tariff hike </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 4 (bdnews24.com)  The government Monday delayed a planned hike in electricity prices and decided to further review the price rise proposal. The power ministry had proposed to increase prices by Tk 0.45 a unit for consumers and Tk 0.37 to Tk 0.52 for distributing agencies, ministry officials said. The government, however, did not rule out tariff adjustment, as the tariff is still lower than production and supply costs. The decision came from a meeting of the advisers' council on economic affairs, chaired by finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam. "The issue is to cut government subsidy to power tariff which is lower than the supply cost. The price is by far smaller compared to those in our neighbouring countries," Azizul Islam told reporters. "A committee has been formed headed by power adviser Tapan Chowdhury to submit a report in a month after reviewing in detail the tariff hike proposal," he said. The current tariff structure is not fair to the government because it has to heavily subsidise the power sector, he said. The government has also deferred another proposal to withdraw the ceiling for an output of 1780 megawatts for independent power producers (IPPs) for further review. "There are some procedural complexities," Islam said. "We've to take the World Bank's consent for withdrawal of the ceiling as there is an agreement with them." Another problem is that a sudden rise in power supply by the IPPs could affect the market negatively, the adviser said. He said a committee has been formed to analyse the issues before raising the ceiling or withdrawing it altogether. The meeting approved delisting of six enterprises, mostly oil companies, marked for privatisation by the previous government. "Oil is a strategic input. The decision of privatising these companies might prove risky," Islam pointed out. The meeting waived Bangladesh Shipping Corporation from the 42-day deadline under public procurement regulations to carry some 38,685 tonnes of wheat from Australia as grant. Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation has also been waived from giving 10 percent performance guarantee required for supply of one crore pieces of sacks. The government approved a committee formed to set terms and conditions of tender for the private sector's involvement in the New Mooring container terminal in Chittagong. Power adviser Tapan Chowdhury was present at the briefing. bdnew
