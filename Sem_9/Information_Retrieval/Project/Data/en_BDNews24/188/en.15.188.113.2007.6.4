 MTUBATUBA, South Africa, June 04 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Philisiwe Zulu was 51 when she got the call from the spirits of her ancestors. "I didn't believe in traditional medicine and the ancestors, but then I got so sick, my children all got sick and my cattle started dying," said the 57-year-old in the small beehive hut where she calls on the spirit world to help heal the sick. "The doctors couldn't cure me so we went to a traditional healer and she said I must train as a healer too. I decided to try it. Went I went for the training I was swollen all over, I couldn't even walk. Within days I was better."

Then she slides on a pair of latex gloves and examines the patient. The verdict? He must go to a clinic to get his eyes fixed and should slaughter a chicken to appease his grandparents, who are feeling unloved, according to the bones. Zulu is one of 80 traditional healers in the area who have been trained how to spot HIV symptoms and refer patients for testing, and provide basic care for people with AIDS. The new skills are proving vital in a district where one in three adults are infected with HIV and Zulu says she has started wearing gloves and has stopped dangerous practices. "I was afraid of HIV before but now I can help people, and I know how to protect myself and my family," she says as she hands out a few condoms to her patient, the conversation punctuated by the sounds of cattle, goats and chickens in the ya
