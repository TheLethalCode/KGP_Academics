 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com)  The European Union strongly supports the interim government's political and institutional reforms, visiting EU Troika delegation leader Andreas Michaelis said Wednesday. The EU, however, wants to see polls within the quickest possible time, Michaelis said after his delegation met law adviser Mainul Hosein. He asked the government to be cautious about the reforms pace. The nine-member EU Troika delegation that arrived in Dhaka Wednesday on a four-day visit also met home secretary Abdul Karim and Anticorruption Commission commissioner Habibur Rahman Wednesday. Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury also threw a dinner party for the delegation Wednesday night. After meeting the commissioner, Michaelis said the EU believes the ACC has been working independently to protect rights of the people. He declined to comment how the EU sees the process of going back to democracy from the state of emergency. He said Troika thinks the polls should be held as early as possible and the ban on political activities should be lifted after the reforms. The Troika delegation leader stressed quick measures if human rights are violated. The delegation will meet civil society members and a select group of citizens to get the hang of pre-polls and political situation, human rights, governance and the caretaker government's activities. Michaelis said he believes the people of the country support the ongoing reforms in the country. The law adviser did not speak to reporters after the meeting. bdnew
