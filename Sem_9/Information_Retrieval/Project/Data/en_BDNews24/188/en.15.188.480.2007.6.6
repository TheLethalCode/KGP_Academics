 NEW DELHI, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Five HIV-positive children have been turned away from a school in southern India for the second time, despite a government promise that they would be allowed to return, newspapers reported on Wednesday. The children -- a boy and four girls aged between five and 11 -- were first thrown out of their school in Kerala state in December after parents of other students complained. But local authorities intervened and said the children could return to Mar Dionysius Lower Primary School in Kottayam district in the new academic year which began on Monday. They made it only as far as the school gate. "Many parents came to us threatening to pull out their wards if the HIV-positive children were readmitted," the Hindustan Times quoted an unnamed teacher as saying. "We are helpless." The state government is now trying to convince the school authorities to change their mind, the paper said. Meanwhile, the children will receive private lessons at their charity-run care home. The United Nations says India has the world's largest HIV caseload, with an estimated 5.7 million people living with the deadly virus. AIDS activists say a lack of awareness and widespread stigma and discrimination have contributed to paranoia about the virus and there have been reports of infected children being expelled from schools and patients denied treatment in hospitals.
