 LONDON, June 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Parents are stopping their children going out to play on their own because of safety fears, potentially restricting their future development, according to a report on Tuesday. The Children's Society survey found that 43 percent of adults thought children should not go out unsupervised until they were 14. That is despite the fact that in their own youth most had been allowed out on their own at the age of 10 or younger. "Children have told us loud and clear that friendship matters and yet this is an area in which we appear to be failing them," said Bob Reitemeier, chief executive of the society. "On the one hand we want freedom for our children but on the other we are becoming increasingly frightened to let them out." Fears over children's safety have been exacerbated by stories in the media of youngsters being attacked by predatory paedophiles, such as the murders of Soham schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman in 2002 and the abduction and killing of Sarah Payne in 2000. However experts say high profile incidents are still rare and there is no evidence to suggest there has been an increase in the number of youngsters murdered by strangers. The study, carried out as part of the society's Good Childhood Inquiry, suggested that early friendships were very important and often lasted a lifetime, with 69 percent of respondents saying they were still in contact with a childhood friend. It added that its inquiry had found that children rate having friends as the most important factor in their lives. But the report said there was research to suggest that since 1986 the number of teenagers with no friends has increased from one in eight to nearly one in five. "All the research shows that spending time with friends is fundamental to children's wellbeing and development which means it is crucial that we resolve this contradiction," said Reitemeier
