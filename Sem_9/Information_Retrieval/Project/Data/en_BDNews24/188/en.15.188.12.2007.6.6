 GORKY 8, Russia, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia said on Wednesday it has "firm solidarity" with Serbia on Kosovo, in a sign that Moscow is unwilling to change its stance on the Balkan province ahead of the Group of Eight summit. "We maintain firm solidarity with you on the question of Kosovo," Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters at a meeting with Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic. "The Serbian government has proposed the continuation of talks and we support this. We will not agree to any unilateral imposition of a decision on Belgrade," Lavrov said at the Gorky 8 state residence, west of Moscow. Kosovo's ethnic majority is impatient for independence and has the backing of the United States and the European Union. But Russia, a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, has hinted it could veto a resolution that supports a plan clearing the way for Kosovo's independence. As diplomats scurry to reach agreement in the United Nations, the future of Kosovo is expected to be high on the informal agenda of G8 leaders who meet in the north German resort of Heiligendamm on Wednesday. Kosovo Albanians demand full independence. Serbia, which views the province as its spiritual heartland, says broad autonomy is the most it can offer. "For Serbia the independence of Kosovo of any kind is absolutely unacceptable ... Russia's position is practically identical to our position," Jeremic said. "The decision about the future status of Kosovo must be based on a compromise. We cannot reach a compromise if the sides do not agree ... a compromise is possible," he said. Kosovo, whose 2 million people are 90 percent ethnic Albanian, has been run by the United Nations since 1999, when NATO bombs drove out Serb forces to halt the slaughter and expulsion of civilians in a two-year war with separatist Albanian guerrillas. Russia, which views Serbia as an ally linked by a common Slavic culture, opposed NATO's bombing of Serbia. Russian officials say the United States and European Union are stirring up future strife in the Balkans by carving up Serbia. President Vladimir Putin will meet Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica this weekend at an international economic forum in Russia's second city of St Petersburg, Lavrov said. Serbia opposes a plan proposed by U.N. mediator Martti Ahtisaari that sets the framework of a Kosovo state, including provisions for an international overseer and autonomy for the province's 100,000 Serbs. Western diplomats have softened a draft United Nations resolution that would allow Kosovo's ethnic Albanians to declare independence. But Moscow wants more fundamental changes to the draft and has called for more talks between Belgrade and the Kosovo Albanians. "We will continue to cooperate closely in all questions including the question of Kosovo," Lavrov sai
