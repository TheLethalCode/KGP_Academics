<TEXT>
 BRIGHTON, England, June 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's next prime minister Gordon Brown will set out plans on Tuesday to get up to 200,000 benefit claimants back into work through creating partnerships between government and business. Brown will say that employment partnerships are being established with businesses in the retail, hotel, hospitality and security sectors as well as the Olympic Delivery Authority. "It's time to train British workers for the British jobs that will be available over the coming years and to make sure that people who are inactive and unemployed are able to get the new jobs on offer," Brown will say in a speech to the GMB Union. "I want to sign partnerships with all the major industries, that they will help British workers to access the jobs that are available." Under the partnerships long-term benefit claimants would get work trials, mentoring and basic skills training which would lead to guaranteed job interviews for those completing the scheme or subsidised employment places. Officials said there were nine million highly skilled workers required in Britain but this figure is set to rise to 14 million by 2020. Skill shortages in Britain have led to a mass influx of immigrants from eastern Europe and other less developed countries. Brown, currently the finance minister, is due to take over from Prime Minister Tony Blair on June 27
