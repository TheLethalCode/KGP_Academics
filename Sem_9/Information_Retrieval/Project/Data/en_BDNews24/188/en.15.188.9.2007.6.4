 Dhaka, June 4 (bdnews24.com) -- Former chief forests conservator Osman Gani was taken on a fresh five-day police remand Monday for questioning about his wealth allegedly earned by unfair means. Police took Gani to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court, Dhaka after his four-day remand ended. Sub-inspector Mizanur Rahman of Uttara Police Station told court that the police had found clues about the sources of his money and appealed for seven days to quiz him in the case. Magistrate Shafiq Anwar approved five days. Osman Gani's lawyer Saifur Rashid opposed the remand appeal in court. On May 29, a court approved a three-day remand for quizzing Gani in a case under the Passport Act. But he is yet to be grilled in that case. bdnew
