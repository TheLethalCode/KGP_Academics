 NAHR AL-BARED, Lebanon, June 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Lebanese troops shelled a Palestinian refugee camp in north Lebanon where al Qaeda-inspired militants remained holed up on Tuesday, and a few of the gunmen gave themselves up to a Palestinian faction. Intermittent bursts of gunfire and shell explosions were heard through the day at Fatah al-Islam's base in Nahr al-Bared camp, a sprawling shantytown which has been pounded by army artillery in more than two weeks of fighting. Mainstream Palestinian faction Hamas warned that fighting could spread to other camps, as it did on Sunday and Monday when militants with a similar ideology to Fatah al-Islam's fought the army at Ain al-Hilweh camp in south Lebanon. "We are seeking a way out of this crisis as soon as possible so that we don't all pay a heavy price," Hamas spokesman in Lebanon Raafat Morra said. Some Fatah al-Islam fighters had surrendered to mainstream faction Fatah, a Fatah official said. "This is one of several steps that would secure an end to this phenomenon," Fatah official Jamal Khalil told Reuters. Palestinian factions including Fatah and Hamas have condemned Fatah al-Islam, which shares al Qaeda's ideology of global jihad and has fighters from across the Arab world. "We fear the repercussions from lengthy military action because there is more than one side trying to sabotage Lebanon and spread the troubles to other places," Morra told reporters. At least 114 people have been killed in the Nahr al-Bared fighting, including 46 soldiers. The army says Fatah al-Islam triggered the conflict when it attacked the army on May 20. The government says Fatah al-Islam had instructed militants from the Jund al-Sham group at Ain al-Hilweh camp to take up arms on Sunday and Monday. Two soldiers were killed. Jund al-Sham members could be seen in the streets but without weapons on Tuesday. Some of the several hundred Palestinians who fled the Ain al-Hilweh fighting began returning home. The violence is the latest jolt to stability in Lebanon. A bomb on Monday near Beirut wounded seven people. It was the fourth blast in and around the capital since the start of the Nahr al-Bared fighting. The blasts have killed one person. Neither Jund al-Sham or Fatah al-Islam have much support among Palestinians in Lebanon, who number some 400,000. The government said on Monday there would be no halt to military action until Fatah al-Islam surrendered. It said the group had sustained a "major blow" with the deaths of several leaders and large number of militants. The group on Monday buried 10 fighters at the camp but it was not known when they were killed, Palestinian sources said. Groups like Fatah al-Islam and Jund al-Sham have been able to operate in Palestinian camps beyond the reach of the Lebanese state. About 27,000 of Nahr al-Bared's 40,000 refugees have fled, many of them to the nearby Beddawi camp. UNRWA, the UN agency that cares for Palestinians, has launched an appeal for $12.7 million to meet the urgent needs of the displaced. Up to 7,000 Palestinians may still be in Nahr al-Bared, where streets are littered with unexploded shells, said Virginia Dela Guardia, spokeswoman for The International Committee of the Red Cross. Rescue workers were trying to evacuate the wounded, she said. "The ambulances are trying to get in but the fighting is still going on," she added. Nineteen camp residents, mainly women and children, were evacuated on Monday and 16 on Saturd
