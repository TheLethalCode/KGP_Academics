<TITLE> Political parties must shed overseas units: Sahul Hossain </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com)  Election commissioner Sahul Hossain Wednesday said political parties must disband their overseas units. The Election Commission has proposed that the parties would conform to the conditions before registration. The EC however decided in principle to enroll expatriates into the electoral roll. He said the main election office did not design any guideline yet on how the expatriates will use their voting right. "The commission is committed to providing expatriates with the voting right. Our preparation is almost complete. I hope they will be able to vote in the next election. Bangladeshis living in Europe and North America will be the first to be voters," Sahul said. The commission wants to stop "kowtowing politics" and believes it is important to stop units of political parties abroad, he said. "There is no political party in the world with units abroad. The politics of this kind divide expatriates, destroy harmony among them and taint the image of the country abroad." There are legal restrictions. "We are working to overcome the problems. Expatriates may be called to Bangladeshi embassies to sign up. They have to show passports to be voters," he said. "Those who are staying abroad with dual citizenship will face legal restrictions. Those who have rejected Bangladeshi citizenship won't be allowed to be voters." bdnew
