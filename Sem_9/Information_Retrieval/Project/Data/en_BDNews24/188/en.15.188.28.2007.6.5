 TOKYO, June 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Civilian and military police raided two navy bases in western Japan on Tuesday over leaked classified data on the missile defence system that Japan shares with the United States, local media reported. Investigators searched the naval facilities and questioned former trainees from the Japanese navy suspected of having received sensitive information on the high-tech Aegis radar system, used by the United States on ships fitted with SM-3 ballistic missile interceptors, the reports said. Japanese police would not confirm the reports, saying only that investigations were under way. One of Japan's Aegis ships is set to be fitted with SM-3 missile interceptors, similar to those operated by the United States, by the end of this year. The leak earlier this year of classified data worried the United States and came as the two countries pledged closer defence ties. Police raided a naval college in western Japan over the leak of the sensitive data last month. Local media reports had said classified data on US-built advanced missile interceptors has been leaked in Japan. In addition to the data on the SM-3 interceptors, police found that confidential material was leaked regarding the "Link 16" information distribution system -- the latest system used in major US warships and fighter jets -- the media reports had said. Data on the interceptors and the information system are classified under a 1954 law on protecting secrets related to the Japan-US mutual defence agreement. US Defence Secretary Robert Gates voiced his concerns when he met his Japanese counterpart Fumio Kyuma in Washington in late April, and Kyuma promised to take steps to prevent any recurrence of such leaks
