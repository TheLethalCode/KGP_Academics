<TEXT>
 JOHANNESBURG, June 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South African police on Monday fired rubber bullets to disperse a crowd of nurses taking part in a nationwide strike over pay, wounding several, state radio reported. Police also arrested 20 nurses in the incident at a hospital in the city of Durban, the radio said. It quoted police as saying the nurses were blocking entrances to the hospital. The strike, which started on Friday, was organised by the powerful COSATU federation of trade unions, which has said it will not call off the mass action until the goverment agrees to give workers a 12 percent pay rise. The government has offered 6 percent. South Africa's economy -- the continent's biggest -- is booming but civil servants complain they haven't had a pay rise since one that ended a major public service strike in 2004. President Thabo Mbeki's government fears that significant wage increases could further raise inflation. Anger boiled over after an official body recently recommended Mbeki receive a 57 percent pay rise
