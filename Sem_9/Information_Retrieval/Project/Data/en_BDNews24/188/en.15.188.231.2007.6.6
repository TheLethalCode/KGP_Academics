<TITLE> Ecuador Congress opens probe into economy minister </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 QUITO, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ecuador's Congress on Tuesday said it opened a probe into charges of insider dealing against Economy Minister Ricardo Patino, linked to comments about sovereign debt payments recorded in a secret video. "The minister has been notified of the probe," said Ramsses Torres, the head of the congressional commission leading the investigation. Opposition lawmakers say the video shows Patino cooperating with investors to develop a scheme in which he would deliberately spook the market about debt payments to profit from credit default swaps, or debt insurance. Patino denies the charges and says he secretly had the meeting taped as part of a government campaign to gather evidence that investors seek to manipulate debt markets. He is scheduled to face questioning by lawmakers on Tuesday. The probe could lead to Patino's censure in Congress, but President Rafael Correa has the final say on his job and has publicly backed his minister over the scandal. "This is a good way of measuring Correa's sway over Congress," said Luisa Palacios, an analyst with Barclays Capital in New York. "There could be a positive twist out of all of this... because Correa has lost popularity there is a change he might moderate his tone to improve his image with the public opinion," she added. The video tape, shot on Feb. 12, was made only two days before Ecuador paid a February bond coupon, despite an earlier vow not to make the payment. The sequence of events fueled opposition accusations that Patino manipulated the market to benefit Venezuelan banks. Correa, an ally of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, has worried Wall Street with pledges to overhaul the country's foreign debt and suspend bond payments based on moral grounds. Ecuador's top prosecutor is also investigating possible irregularities by the Finance Ministry linked to operations with Ecuador's foreign bonds
