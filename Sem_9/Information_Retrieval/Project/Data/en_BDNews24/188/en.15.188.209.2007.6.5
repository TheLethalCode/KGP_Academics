<TITLE> It's not to whiten black money: NBR chairman </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 05 (bdnews24.com)  The National Board of Revenue (NBR) chief says that legalising untaxed money has been allowed temporarily to give some people the facility and to boost revenues. He also clarified that the facility was not for those holding ill-gotten money. "It is unexpected that a section of the media is branding it whitening of black money instead of untaxed money," NBR chairman Badiur Rahman told journalists after a meeting with senior tax officials at the NBR. "It is to whiten the white money, not the black money," Rahman categorically said. The NBR chief also warned the tax officials saying that action would be taken against them (officials) if complaints or harassments were reported. "This is an acid test for you people (officials). Intelligence officials of the government will monitor you," Rahman said: We've to utilise the facility. The government Monday allowed people to legalise untaxed money, starting Tuesday for two months up to July 31. People have to pay only 5 percent tax in penalty in addition to normal tax rates, the NBR said in a circular on the rare move. Rahman said that the facility has been given following demands from different quarters, besides the necessity to mobilise more internal resources. He said that many people in the country did not pay taxes on their legal income. Many also hid their real income. These people have been given the chance, he added. "Government needs to reduce dependence on bank borrowing, but it is not possible without increasing resources from the internal sources," he noted. "The ongoing anti-graft drive would not be hampered at all for the facility of legalising untaxed money," he said. Replying to a query, Rahman said, according to the World Bank, on an average the informal sector contributes to about 35 percent of a country's economy. To another question, he said there is no definition of black money in the Income Tax Ordinance 1984. bdnew
