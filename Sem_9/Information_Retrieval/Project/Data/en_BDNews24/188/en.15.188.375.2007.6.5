 MUMBAI, June 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Indian court sentenced two more people to life imprisonment on Tuesday for their role in the country's worst bombings in 1993 which killed 257 people. The court also handed jail terms for between 5 and 14 years to another three people convicted in the case. The court in Mumbai, where the attacks took place, has convicted 100 people and so far sentenced 68. Bollywood star Sanjay Dutt, 47, is the most high-profile of the convicts. He was found guilty of illegal possession of arms. No date has been set for his sentencing. Those sentenced so far include smugglers, petty criminals, a Bollywood producer and also policemen and customs officials who took bribes to let the explosives through. An 83-year-old man is among those jailed for life for planning the blasts. Police say the bomb attacks were ordered by India's most wanted crime boss, Dawood Ibrahim, a Muslim, who wanted to avenge the razing of a 16th century mosque by Hindu zealots in 1992
