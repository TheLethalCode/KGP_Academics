<TEXT>
 GAZA, June 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hamas and Fatah forces fought a major gun battle on Tuesday in the Gaza Strip near the Karni commercial crossing, the most serious flare-up in factional fighting in two weeks. An officer with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's Presidential Guard said a "large number" of Hamas fighters attacked a key Presidential Guard position near the crossing, wounding at least one guard member. The Presidential Guard officer said the Hamas fighters attempted to infiltrate the position but were pushed back by the Presidential Guard, a Fatah-dominated force which receives US backing. Hamas, which leads a Palestinian unity government with Abbas's Fatah faction, confirmed the nearly three-hour-long gun battle near Karni but said the Presidential Guard initiated the exchange. The United States and Israel say Hamas's armed wing and Executive Force receive funding and arms from Iran and other Islamist allies. A senior Western security source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there were several injuries on the Hamas side. Hamas had no immediate comment on whether its forces sustained any casualties. The Western security source said Hamas attacked the same position, a Presidential Guard training base next to Karni, on May 15 at the height of last month's factional fighting between secular Fatah and Hamas Islamists. Tuesday's flare-up near Karni was the most serious since a shaky ceasefire between Fatah and Hamas took hold two weeks ago after a wave of factional fighting killed some 50 Palestinians. A senior Western security source said between 50 and 100 Hamas fighters took part in the morning assault, but those figures could not be independently confirmed. "They (the Hamas fighters) tried to take over the crossing but were repulsed," the Western security source said
