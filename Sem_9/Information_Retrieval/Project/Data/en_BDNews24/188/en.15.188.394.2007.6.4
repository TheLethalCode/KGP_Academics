 Dhaka, June 4 (bdnews24.com) -- Police Monday scuffled with a Juba Mahila League activist when she tried to enter Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina's Sudha Sadan home in Dhanmondi. Some Awami Leaders alleged the police barred them to enter in. Juba Mahila League leader Sabina Akter Tuhin had a squabble with the police deployed at Hasina's home, which ended up in a scuffle after they stopped her at about 12.30pm. AL leaders KM Hasan Kabir Sharif and Akter Hossain failed to meet the party chief and went back after waiting an hour outside the police barricade near Sudha Sadan. The AL chief's special assistant Dr Hasan Mahmud entered Sudha Sadan at about 9.15am. At about 11am, Subhash Singha Roy, AL assistant secretary of central sub-committee for divisions, Dhaka district general secretary Mahbubur Rahman, Juba Mohila League's general secretary Apu Ukil entered Sudha Sadan. Police stopped AL science and technology affairs secretary Yafes Osman at midday and told him that they could not allow many people together at a time inside Sudha Sadan. Mahmud later came out and asked the policemen if they had any instruction not to allow many people in, to which they said they had one. Mahmud later told reporters that he had talked to inspector general of police Noor Mohammad who said he would look into the matter. Mahmud then took Yafes Osman inside Sudha Sadan by force. AL relief and social welfare secretary Nazma Rahman, AL Meherpur district president Joynal Abedin and women affairs secretary Dr Dipu Moni met Hasina. bdnews
