<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, June 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian property developer PIK Group raised $1.8 billion in an initial public offering, pricing the placement at the bottom of the range, becoming Russia's top developer with a market value of $12.3 billion. PIK said the offering was Europe's largest ever IPO by a real estate firm and the largest placement by a private sector company in the former Soviet Union. The firm said on Friday it had priced its Moscow and London IPO at $25 per share, at the bottom of its guidance of $25-$31, signalling fading appetite for Russian developers and IPOs in general after a flurry of placements. "We believe that after this IPO, investors' appetite for real estate investments may be nearly sated, making any further placements in the sector more challenging," said Rustam Botashev from Aton brokerage. Kommersant business daily quoted banking sources as saying the offering was rescued at the last minute by two large Asian funds, which committed $500 million each. "It was a tough placement," one source told Kommersant. PIK said four investors would each buy more than five percent of the offering, together accounting for approximately 62.9 percent of the offering. PIK Group is one of the leaders of the booming property development market in Russia's capital, which has a population of over 15 million. Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley, Nomura and Merrill Lynch organised the offering. Shares in another Russia-focused real estate company AFI Development slid 20 percent since it raised $1.4 billion last month, becoming the country's most valuable developer with a market capitalisation of $7.3 billion. PIK's and AFI's IPOs dwarf previous placements by other Russian construction and real estate firms Open Investments and Sistema-Hals. PIK's record IPO will also produce a reshuffle on the list of Russian richest people after it disclosed its major owners. The firm said chief executive Kirill Pisarev and chairman Yury Zhukov will each hold 42.5 percent in the firm post-IPO and prior to the over-allotment while 15 percent will be freely traded. It means the two men will be worth $5.23 billion each putting them among the 25 richest people in Russia, compared to no 76 and 77 in the latest Russian rich list published by US Forbes magazine. The Russian real estate sector has boomed in recent years, offering returns of over 100 percent a year, though there are signs that prices have begun to stagnate in the past few months. Dozens of Russian firms have announced plans to list in Russia and abroad against a background of booming markets and an explosion in corporate finance, debt and equity deals. Many analysts say Russian firms are rushing their IPOs to cash out before the presidential election in March 2008. One of PIK's main focuses is production and assembly of concrete panel housing in Moscow as a subcontractor for the Moscow city government. Moscow's mayor Yuri Luzhkov is due to step down in December after 15 years in office. PIK said its shares would start trading in London under the symbol PIK around June 6. In Moscow, trading under the symbol PIKK will start on the RTS bourse on June 4 and on the MICEX exchange around June 11
