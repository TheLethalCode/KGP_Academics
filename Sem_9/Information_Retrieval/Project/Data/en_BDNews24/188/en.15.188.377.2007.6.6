<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 06 (bdnews24.com)  The national budget for fiscal 2007-08 will be announced Thursday by the interim administration led by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed. Finance adviser Azizul Islam is to announce the budget against a backdrop of political and economic reforms, stagnant farm productivity and growing restlessness over soaring prices. The budget is expected to increase spending on the poor and aim to keep high growth on track and at the same time try to protect the public from the rising prices of essential commodities. Azizul Islam has already publicly stated that there will be a sizeable deficit in the budget to be addressed by 'streamlining internal resource mobilisation'. Analysts say the finance adviser is likely to avoid populist giveaways, as his administration need not submit to the same political pressures as an elected government. However, the present administration looks set to widen the social safety net in the upcoming budget to accelerate poverty reduction initiatives, finance ministry officials said. Both the allocation and the number of recipients would increase by 10 percent in the budget, they said. They stress that the finance adviser faces a tough battle to push badly needed reforms in the budget to keep up the pace of growth. Another major challenge the adviser will face is to address infrastructure constraints, which analysts, businessmen and economists say are eroding the country's economic potential. "The focus of the budget should be on ensuring macro-economic stability," said Zaid Bakht, research director at Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS). The major challenges for the interim government, therefore, will be to contain soaring inflationwhich reached a nine-year record of 8.28 percent in Apriland to increase of revenue collections, Bakht told bdnews24.com. He added the government has to try to combat inflation by cutting some import duties and improving supply side constraints. "There will be no political pressure for the government. It is free to make decisions solely on economic grounds," said Zaid Bakht. In this context, the finance adviser will be able to take some bold decisions to improve conditions in the energy sector, increase foreign investment and tackle infrastructure bottlenecks, according to Bakht. "There will be more spending on agriculture, power, infrastructure and social sectors in the upcoming budget," Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed told it told local TV reporters on the ATN Bangla channel. Independent think-tank, the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) in its budget recommendations said stabilising market prices, particularly food prices, addressing inequality and augmenting investment and tax base would be the major challenges for the government. ECONOMIC GROWTH The economy of Bangladesh, one of the least developed countries in the world, has been growing at an average of over 5 percent a year over the past decade. Economic growth for the fiscal year 2005-06 was 6.71 percent. The previous government projection a 7 percent growth rate in the current fiscal year ending June 30. The estimation was later revised, however, to 6.51 percent mainly because of low farm production and a poor investment scenario. "The government has to sustain the growth momentum of the economy," said Zaid Bakht. "The finance adviser must give special attention to improving the poor state of investment, revenue collection and infrastructure conditions for the growth." The CPD had previously stated the growth projection of 6.51 percent for this fiscal year would not be achieved. While the Asian Development Bank had also earlier revised the GDP growth to 6.5 percent for the current fiscal year following the decline in farm production. AGRICULTURE AND INFRASTRUCTURE Agricultural production, especially aus and aman production, experienced a negative growth this year. Bangladesh is increasingly dependant on the import of food grains, causing market prices to rise steeply. Budget expert and former finance secretary Akbar Ali Khan and economist Debapriya Bhattacharya have stated that Bangladesh has few options other than increasing agricultural production to curb the inflationary pressure on consumers. Agriculture's share of the economy has shrunk to about 20 percent this fiscal year from 25 percent in 2001-02, but two-thirds of the population of over 140 million still depends on farming and allied activities. BGMEA (Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association) president Anwar-Ul-Alam Chowdhury (Parvez) said Bangladesh has the potential to earn $18 billion to $20 billion a year from exports if infrastructure constraints, particularly power, were removed. Bangladesh had fetched $10.5 billion from exports in 2005-06, of which 76 percent was from the RMG (Ready Made Garments) sector. The export-earning target for the current fiscal year has been set at $12.5 billion, projecting a 19 percent growth. Export earnings in the first 10 months of the current fiscal year were $9.9 billion. bdn
