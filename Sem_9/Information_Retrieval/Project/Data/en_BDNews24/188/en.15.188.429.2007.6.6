 SYDNEY, June 06 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Down Under version of the popular board game Monopoly has snubbed Australia's biggest city of Sydney after an online vote rated the Barossa Valley wine region as the nation's top property. The game's manufacturer Hasbro received almost 17 million votes for Australia's top locations, to be included in an updated local version of the game where players buy and develop properties to boost their bank accounts. People in regional areas, including South Australia's Barossa Valley, and the outback mining towns of Kalgoorlie and Broken Hill, campaigned strongly to win a place on the board game, but apathetic Sydneysiders missed out. "They only just missed out," Hasbro marketing manager Amanda Blackhall told Reuters on Wednesday, meaning the city's popular beaches, Harbour Bridge and Opera House will not be featured on the new game board. Blackhall said the Barossa Valley, near the South Australian capital of Adelaide, received about two million votes after launching a public campaign to win votes. The mining towns of Kalgoorlie in Western Australia, Broken Hill in remote New South Wales, and Sovereign Hill in Victoria, also mounted public campaigns to attract votes. "There was a real battle between the mining towns," Blackhall said. "We would never have imagined that the Australian public would have embraced this concept and taken it so far." The Australian version also includes updated game tokens to reflect Australia's lifestyle, including a surfboard, a koala, a mobile phone and pair of Australian rubber flip-flop sandals, known as thongs. Hasbro revamped the board of 'Monopoly: Here and Now' US edition last year after an on-line vote, and similar votes are underway in New Zealand, Germany and Brita
