 LONDON, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British telecoms group Cable & Wireless Plc said on Wednesday Chairman Richard Lapthorne could be awarded a bonus currently worth as much 11 million pounds ($21.9 million) if he hits performance targets over three years. C&W said Lapthorne, who would face annual re-election, had been given a new contract with a 12 months' notice period on either side, replacing a fixed contract that ran until January 2009. "The board considered it a priority to secure Richard's continuing contribution to the turnaround and transformation of our business beyond his current fixed term," senior non-executive director Clive Butler said in a statement. Based on Tuesday's closing price of 199 pence the bonus of up to 5.5 million shares could net Lapthorne, whose basic salary is 386,000 pounds a year, around 11 million pounds. The group unveiled a controversial long-term incentive plan last year to give its 60 top managers a bonus pool of over 200 million pounds if its share price hits 228 pence by 2010. C&W said it intended to recommend at its annual shareholder meeting in July that a 20 million pounds cap would be removed on the amount an individual could receive and that some of any award above this level could be made in shares. C&W, with a history that dates back to the 1860s when telegraph cables were first laid overseas from Britain, is in the midst of a radical overhaul in the UK which will cut 3,000 jobs over five years. Shares in C&W have doubled in value over the last year following persistent bid talk and the group is worth around 4.7 billion pounds
