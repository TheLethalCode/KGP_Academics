 Dhaka, June 4 (bdnews24.com)  The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka sent businessman Abdul Awal Mintoo to jail Monday after his four-day remand ended. The same court ordered another businessman, Abul Khair Litu, into a three-day remand for questioning in a case under emergency powers rules. Police appealed for a seven-day remand for Litu. Magistrate Mir Ali Reza issued the orders. Litu, chairman of Bengal Group, stands accused of earning huge wealth through corrupt means, grabbing land, threatening security of the state and looting state resources. Litu was arrested with suspected links to a conspiracy to topple the government, police said. His lawyers said he is an innocent person and the allegations against him are false. Former FBCCI president Mintoo's lawyers appealed to court, seeking his bail but the court turned down the appeal saying the court does not have jurisdiction to hear a bail appeal. The High Court and trial courts can hear bail appeals in the cases filed after April 18 under the Emergency Powers Ordinance, the lawyers said. But the magistrate said only the High Court can hear such an appeal, not trial courts. Representatives from the United Nations, European Union and USA were present in court and recommended granting bail to Mintoo, Ukraine's honorary consular for Bangladesh and a dual citizen of the US and Bangladesh. In court, barrister Rafiq-ul Haque, backed by advocate Ajmalul Hossain QC, said: "If he (Mintoo) doesn't get bail, he should be given division as he is a renowned businessman." He said Mintoo had once represented Bangladesh in a convention of the International Labour Organisation in Geneva. "At the age of 72, I am saying he is simply my brother. I am the same as his guardian. He is not my client. Believe me." The court rejected an appeal for division. With all appeals snubbed by the court, Mintoo's wife sobbed. Joint forces arrested Mintoo on May 29 and Litu on Sunday. bdnew
