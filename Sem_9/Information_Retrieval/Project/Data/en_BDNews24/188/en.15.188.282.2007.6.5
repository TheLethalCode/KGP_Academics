<TITLE> Europe shares dip; rate fears offset miners, autos </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PARIS, June 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares were slightly lower by midday on Tuesday, as interest rate concerns offset strength in carmakers, a rebound in Chinese stocks and an upbeat note on the mining sector that boosted BHP Billiton. Autos were led higher by French car maker Renault, which gained as much as 3 percent to an all time high of 116.55 euros after Deutsche Bank raised its price target to 144 euros. The stock has been rising at a brisk pace since March amid renewed investor confidence that it is on track to reverse sagging sales. At 1112 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading European shares was down 0.04 percent at 1,621.46. Investors were focused on two key rate decisions -- from the European Central Bank, on Wednesday, and the Bank of England on Thursday. "The ECB's rate hike is already priced in, and the focus will be on the bank's tone following the meeting," said Christophe Donay, strategist at Kepler Equities, in Paris. If the bank adopts a hawkish tone on inflation, Donay said, the stock market could react negatively. "But I don't expect that to happen. Inflation is not accelerating in Europe." The European Central Bank is expected to raise rates to 4 percent on Wednesday, while the Bank of England is seen keeping rates constant on Thursday, though most analysts see rates going up by the end of the third quarter. Around Europe, London's FTSE 100 index rose 0.21 percent, while Frankfurt's DAX dipped 0.03 percent, and France's CAC 40 shed 0.06 percent. Miners were on the rise, with BHP Billiton gaining 1.5 percent and Antofagasta rising 1.4 percent, following an upbeat sector note from Citigroup. Britain's United Utilities rose 4 percent to lead European gainers after it put its electricity distribution assets up for sale and posted strong results. On the downside, budget airline Ryanair tumbled 6.8 percent after it warned of a slowdown despite posting better-than-expected full-year net profits. Analysts said that stock valuations in Europe had gone up too much for equities to remain a good bet, with interest-rate increases lurking. Morgan Stanley strategist Teun Draaisma said the outlook for shares in the next six months was not very good, and interest rates posed the biggest threat. "The mid-cycle slowdown, during which growth slows and rates go lower, is over. U.S. 10-year bond yields are approaching 5 percent, which is dangerous, and valuations in Europe are too expensive," he said. "What we're saying is: take profits on your equity overweights and go back to neutral. Stay in cash and underweight on bonds." Chinese shares reversed an early sharp drop and closed up 2.6 percent on Tuesday on rumours that authorities would make a policy statement to restore investor confidence. A fall in Chinese stocks at the end of February triggered a short but sharp slide in global equities. But stock markets worldwide are becoming more and more immune to big swings on Chinese markets, Donay said. "The market has started to understand the necessity to slow down Chinese stocks that are rising too fast, and realises that the Chinese economy's fundamentals are still robust." On the macroeconomic side, euro zone services growth rose at a marginally faster rate than expected in May, while retail sales in the euro zone rose less than expected in April, data showed
