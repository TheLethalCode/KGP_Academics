 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com) -- Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Wednesday emphasised efforts to keep up the rule of law and discipline. In his speech to a three-day council of deputy commissioners, the CA asked the district administrators to play an active role in combating corruption at grassroots levels. "We can lay down policy but the responsibility is yours to implement it," Fakhruddin said. "The situation has improved with everyone's cooperation, people are in peace. It should be permanent," the chief adviser said. "Our goal is to control corruption as much as possible. People's support to the government is a great achievement. We have to live up to people's expectations that are rising with time. "Our target is a fair election and combating corruption. The anticorruption battle is going on centrally. The accused will be put on trial and be punished," Fakhruddin told the council at the Chief Adviser's Office. He also said: "Both the government and private sectors should be integrated not to let the situation go back to where we started." Traders are the driver of the economy, he said. "We have to think about how we can provide them with more facilities." On the purpose of the government, Fakhruddin said: "The government's aim, activities, strategies and achievements have to be made public. Newspapers are already doing the job." He told the deputy commissioners: "You can play an important role in highlighting the government's role." The interim boss said the informal economy played a significant role in the country's economy. "An eviction of small traders from roadside bazaars is hampering the informal economy. If necessary, you will lease out bazaars on approval from the ministry." "Because of eviction, small traders may face problems and the eviction must be stopped immediately." Fakhruddin underscored increasing the standards of services by state-run companies. "In government offices, the standards of services should improve." "The government is determined to establish good governance. It's not possible in a day or a month. It takes time." bdnews
