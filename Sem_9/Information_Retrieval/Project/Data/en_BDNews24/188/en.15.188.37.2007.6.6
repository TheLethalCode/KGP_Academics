 Dhaka, Jun 6 (bdnews24.com) -- The benchmark index on the Dhaka Stock Exchange hit a new high of 2024 points Wednesday after a rise in the shares of power, pharmaceuticals and banking sectors avoided a downward trend in the market. Power Grid Company of Bangladesh and Square Pharma led the rally although other heavyweights such as Lafarge Surma Cement, Rupali Bank and BRAC Bank ended lower. Lafarge Surma, BRAC and Rupali fell 3.19 percent, 2.01 percent and 4.03 percent respectively. The new high breached the previous high of 2017.44 on June 4. "A downturn guided the market although it increased nominally," said Moin Al Kashem, a market analyst. The DGEN or general index finished at 2024.23, up 17.40 points or 0.86 percent. The DSI or all-share price index added 8.69 points or 0.52 percent to 1664.09. Buoyed by a rally in bank and pharmaceutical shares, the DSE-20 blue-chip index surged 47.21 points or 2.65 percent to 1825.72. The Dhaka Stock Exchange recorded a decline in turnover at Tk 1.57 billion from Tuesday's Tk 1.79 billion. On the Chittagong Stock Exchange, turnover slipped to Tk 235.44 million from Tk 306.84 million. All the indices on the CSE posted gains. Losers however beat gainers 87 to 78. A total of 19 issues held steady on the DSE. On the CSE, 47 issues gained, 43 declined and seven remained unchanged. BRAC Bank, top issue on the turnover board at Tk 170.26 million, slumped 2.01 percent after investors locked in profits in the last spell of trading to end at Tk 718.5. Square Pharma climbed 3.44 percent to Tk 3767, buoyed by block deals. Rumours of foreign investment in Square Group inspired the gains. "We have no undisclosed price sensitive information," said Khondker Habibuzzaman, secretary of Square Pharma. Power Grid Company of Bangladesh added 0.78 percent to Tk 611 after a decline the previous day.
