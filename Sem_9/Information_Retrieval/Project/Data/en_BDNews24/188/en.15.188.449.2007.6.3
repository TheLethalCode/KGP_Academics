Fakhruddin described the background of taking over state power. "You know the background against which the government took charge of the country.

The chief adviser said efforts were underway to create a proper context for honest people to participate in the election. "Voters will go to the polls without fear, and the election will remain free from the evil influence of black money and muscle power." "We'll hold the elections as early as possible," he said. Fakhruddin said his administration was working on a flawless electoral roll with photographs because it is a condition for a fair election. He also said the Election Commission was working to rewrite the electoral laws. "They are now parleying with different professional groups on this issue," he said. The chief adviser said the corrupt people must be accountable for what they had done. Those who have been accused will be tried under law, he said. The whole process of the trial is transparent, he said, adding reporters are witnessing how trial is being held. "Corruption will not end with the punishment of the corrupt people. A social movement is a must for that," he said. Fakhruddin focused on various steps of his administration that included power crisis, prices of essentials, fertiliser crisis, Chittagong port, Mongla port, law and order and Public Service Commission. He also gave an account of the successes achieved under his leadership. Fakhruddin insisted that his government was accountable to the people.
