<TITLE> Israel-Palestinian summit postponed amid discord </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JERUSALEM, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A planned summit between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was put off on Wednesday in a sign of differences over the scope of Israeli steps to bolster the Fatah leader. Olmert and Abbas had been expected to meet for the first time on Thursday in the West Bank city of Jericho, reviving US brokered talks that are supposed to focus on aspects of Palestinian statehood. But both sides have been haggling over proposed Israeli confidence-building measures, including the release of frozen Palestinian tax funds and an easing of travel restrictions in the occupied West Bank. Olmert also signalled ahead of the summit that he would not accept Abbas's call for a truce with militants in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Israel stepped up its military operations last month in Gaza in response to a surge in rocket attacks by Hamas militants against Israeli towns. Hamas leads a Palestinian unity government. Israeli forces killed two Palestinians early on Wednesday, including one in the West Bank, and Hamas fired mortar bombs at an Israeli-run border crossing with Gaza. "The meeting tomorrow (Thursday) between Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas has been postponed as per the Palestinians' request," Olmert's office said in a statement. An official in Olmert's office said no new date had been set for the summit but that Olmert would be prepared to meet with the Palestinian leader at "any time". Olmert has been under US pressure to make progress in talks with Abbas ahead of the Israeli leader's visit to Washington on June 19. The Bush administration wants Olmert to ease travel restrictions in the West Bank and make other gestures that could strengthen Abbas's secular Fatah faction in its power struggle with ruling Hamas Islamists. Fatah joined a unity government led by Hamas in March but fighting between the factions has continued, and Abbas said on Tuesday that the Palestinians were on the brink of civil war. Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said preparations were still under way for the Olmert-Abbas summit. "The focus is on the content of the meeting rather than on the venue or the date," Erekat said. Abbas aide Nabil Abu Rdainah said: "There is a need to reach an agreement on some issues before convening the meeting." Olmert last met Abbas on April 15 as part of U.S.-brokered talks that were supposed to take place every two weeks and focus on aspects of a future Palestinian state. The bilateral dialogue has been repeatedly delayed by Palestinian internal violence, Israeli-Palestinian fighting and Olmert's uncertain political future following an inquiry critical of his handling of last year's war in Lebanon. Erekat and Abu Rdainah did not offer details about the sticking points that prompted Thursday's postponement. Ahead of the planned talks, Olmert's office signalled a newfound willingness to return at least some of the tax revenues Israel has been withholding from the Palestinian Authority since Hamas won a parliamentary election in January 2006. But Israeli officials said any transfers would have to go through a mechanism to ensure the money would not end up in the hands of the Hamas-led government or militants. Abbas's aides have said all of the tax money should be returned to the Palestinians without conditions. Palestinian officials estimate that Israel is withholding some $700 million in Palestinian tax revenues. But Israeli officials estimate that only $300 million to $400 million of that could be transferred to the Palestinians because the rest of the money has been frozen by court orde
