<TITLE> Taiwan ruling party to stir China with referenda </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TAIPEI, June 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Taiwan's ruling political party will attempt three voter referenda and pursue other reforms to advance the island's independence from China and rewrite its history, the party chief said on Tuesday. The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has prepared two voter referenda and begun researching a third to promote "transitional justice" after decades of authoritarian rule and make Taiwan a "normal country" free of Chinese pressure, said Chairman You Si-kun. Beijing leaders have threatened to strike Taiwan militarily if it moves too far toward formal independence. They see the island as a breakaway province that should properly be under their rule, in a dispute left over from the civil war of 1949, when Taiwan split from China after the communist victory. Taiwan has ruled itself since then. "China must face that truth," You said in an interview with Reuters. "If the Taiwan people assert that this is a normal country, in the end Chinese leaders have to acknowledge that." Even Chinese President Hu Jintao, he said, "has not refuted that Taiwan is actually independent." One referendum, which has cleared election officials and needs 82,000 signatures or chops to qualify, would ask voters what to do with assets the DPP says the rival Nationalist Party (KMT) stole from the government before 2000, when You's party first won the presidency. The party has also submitted to election officials a referendum calling for Taiwan to apply for U.N. membership as "Taiwan" rather than the "Republic of China", You said. Voter approval would "help" Taiwan get a UN seat in the face of resistant China allies, he predicted. Most of the world's countries do not extend diplomatic recognition to Taiwan, and China lobbies vigorously to keep it that way. Also as part of the "normal country" package, the DPP via the presidency will change old school textbooks, further reduce remembrances of former KMT strongman Chiang Kai-shek and complete about 170 proposed changes to the names of public institutions from "Republic of China" to "Taiwan", You said. His statements come ahead of legislative elections in January and a tight March 2008 presidential race against the KMT, which takes a more conciliatory view toward ties with China. Stronger independence moves, such as redefining Taiwan's territory to exclude China or changing the flag would call for revisions of the KMT-era Constitution, something which would take another voter referendum, You said. Party members are researching this referendum and other ways to change the Constitution, he said. Under the KMT, Taiwan's government insisted for decades it was the legitimate ruler of all China. DPP chairman You, 59, who is a former premier and was a failed presidential nominee this year, will begin a nine-day trip to the United States on Wednesday to sell Taiwan expatriates -- a strong group of potential voters -- on the "normal country" package. "The trip will appeal to overseas Taiwanese to keep supporting local sovereignty, let the DPP keep governing and let Taiwan become a normal country at an early date," he said
