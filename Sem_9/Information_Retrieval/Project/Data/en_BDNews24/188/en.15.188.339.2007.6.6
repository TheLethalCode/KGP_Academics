<TITLE> Vaughan says misquoted in Flintoff criticism </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MANCHESTER, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England captain Michael Vaughan said on Wednesday a newspaper interview in which he was highly critical of all-rounder Andrew Flintoff had misquoted him. In the interview, published by The Guardian on Tuesday, Vaughan was quoted as saying that Flintoff's drunken antics in the West Indies, where he had to be rescued from a capsized pedalo boat, had upset team spirit for the World Cup. Vaughan's main issue with the story was that it had quoted him saying 'Fredalo' in reference to the tabloid headline the incident sparked. "We stand by our story and have the quotes on tape," a spokesman for Guardian sports desk said on Wednesday. Vaughan told a news conference that the whole thing had been blown out of proportion. "One word changed the whole context of the article -- a word which I didn't say," Vaughan said at Old Trafford, where England are due play West Indies in the third test on Thursday. "I didn't use the word 'Fredalo'. It may have been used in the question but I didn't say it. As soon as you use that word you are pinpointing one person. "The whole story was meant to be about my return to international cricket and somebody got excited with a few quotes. "What I said in the piece is nothing I haven't said in the last six weeks. I feel very sorry for what has happened but I was certainly not pinpointing anyone," Vaughan added. Vaughan was confident his relationship with Flintoff, who is recovering from ankle surgery, would not be harmed by the incident. "Me and Freddie have a great relationship, we are good mates," he said. "We're trying to prepare for a test match and all of a sudden this arises and it's very disappointing. "The team saw it and just laughed," he added. "We've all been very honest about our performances and I have, but incredibly it didn't make that article. "I admit I didn't captain as well as I can, I didn't manage the situation as well as I could and I didn't play as well as I could. So if there was anyone to blame for a World Cup fiasco it would be Michael Vaughan." Flintoff was stripped of the vice-captaincy after the incident. England were eliminated at the Super Eights stage of the World Cup, failing to reach the semi-finals
