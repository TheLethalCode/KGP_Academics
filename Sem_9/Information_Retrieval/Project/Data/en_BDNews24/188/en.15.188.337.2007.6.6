 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com)  The police Wednesday barred Awami League leaders and activists to enter party chief Sheikh Hasina's Sudha Sadan home, saying they cannot let more than four persons in at a time. Sub-inspector Giasuddin who was on duty at the Sudha Sadan said they have orders not to allow more than four persons to get in at a time. The Awami League men argued with the law-enforcers over the restrictions to meet the party chief. Deputy police commissioner (Protection) Ahsan Habib Palash told bdnews24.com he was not aware of any such orders. He, however, did not rule out any such instructions on the security officials at Sudha Sadan from the high-ups. "On-duty security officials there might have been instructed to do so," Palash said. From 11am to 1pm, former home minister Mohammed Nasim's elder brother Dr Mohammed Selim, Dhaka district AL general secretary Mahbubur Rahman, women affairs secretary Dr Dipu Moni and presidium member Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury saw Hasina. The police barred Mahila Awami League president Fazilatunnesa Indira, Jubo Mohila League Dhaka City, north, president Sabina Akhter Tuhin and up to 15 activists. Police later allowed the waiting activists in. Tuhin met Hasina along with a Jubo League activist. bdnews24.
