 Dhaka, June 5 (bdnews24.com)Rail communication between Bangladesh and India is expected to commence late July. After a review meeting at the ministry on the progress of the proposed Bangladesh-India rail communication, communication secretary Dr Mahbubur Rahman Tuesday said that trains were expected to start travelling between Dhaka and Kolkata in the third week of July. The exact date would be determined at a bilateral meeting early July, he said. The train travelling from Dhaka would start off from the Dhaka Cantonment railway station every alternate day through the first six months, the secretary said. After the first six months, the train would start its journey from Kamalapur railway station. Mahbub said that the necessary mechanical upgradation of the tracks, import of passenger coaches from Indonesia and installation of security equipment had already been taken care of. The 300-seat train leaving Dhaka will take eleven hours to terminate its journey in Kolkata. Ticket prices will be 20, 12 and eight dollars for different classes. Replying to a query, Mahbub said that the bilateral rail communication treaty signed between Bangladesh and India in 2001, which had expired, would be renewed soon as the law ministry had already approved the proposal. bdnews24.com
