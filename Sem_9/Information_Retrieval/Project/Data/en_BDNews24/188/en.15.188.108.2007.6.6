 LONDON, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Europe's leading national teams must tackle one final round of Euro 2008 qualifying on Wednesday before the competition begins a four-month break until the start of next season. With the start of the finals exactly one year and one day away, the only teams definitely sure of their places in them are co-hosts Austria and Switzerland. Poland, the co-hosts for Euro 2012, and Croatia are just two of the countries dreaming of joining them by signing off with another three points in their respective groups on Wednesday. Poland have never qualified for the European Championship finals but Leo Beenhakker's team can open up an eight-point lead at the top of Group A if they secure a seventh straight win away against Armenia. In the same section, Finland face Belgium knowing victory would take them level on 14 points with second-placed Portugal. Like Poland, Croatia have enjoyed a memorable season and Slaven Bilic's men are aiming to strengthen their place at the top of Group E against Russia. Croatia hold a two-point lead over the Russians and will be confident of extending a 32-match unbeaten run at home in qualifiers, dating back to 1994. Also in action are second-placed Israel, who visit Andorra, and England, the section's other main contenders in fourth place. England are five points behind Croatia and need to win in Estonia to stay in contention. Group B leaders France will hope to build on Saturday's 2-0 win over Ukraine by defeating Georgia, despite the absence of injured goalkeeper Gregory Coupet. Their closest rivals Italy visit Lithuania with coach Roberto Donadoni expected to make changes following an unconvincing 2-1 victory in the Faroe Islands. Donadoni may omit midfielder Gennaro Gattuso who is one booking away from a suspension for the September showdown with France. EUROPEAN CHAMPIONS With Ukraine not playing, Scotland will climb at least one place to third provided they avoid defeat against the Faroes. European champions Greece will aim to shrug off the absence of suspended skipper Angelos Basinas by beating Moldova and opening up a five-point gap on Turkey in Group C. Norway and Bosnia can join second-placed Turkey on 13 points by defeating Hungary and Malta respectively. In Group D, leaders Germany face fourth-placed Slovakia with coach Joachim Loew likely to keep faith with out-of-sorts striker Miroslav Klose, meaning Mario Gomez -- who scored twice against San Marino on Saturday -- will again start on the bench. With Northern Ireland not playing, Sweden and Spain could both end the day joint top of Group F. Sweden host Finland still waiting to hear whether UEFA will award them a default victory following Saturday's abandoned 3-3 draw in Denmark. Spain visit Liechtenstein optimistic of a fourth straight win, while Denmark's fading hopes will likely disappear altogether should they fail to win at bottom-placed Latvia. With the Netherlands not in action, Romania can take the outright lead in Group G by beating Slovenia while Bulgaria will leapfrog the Dutch into second place if they can overcome Belaru
