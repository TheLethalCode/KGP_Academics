<TITLE> Nikkei flat, Toyota rises but China concerns drag </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, June 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Nikkei average eked out a 0.08 percent gain to close at its highest in three months on Monday as Toyota Motor Corp. rose on strong US sales data while worries about falls in Chinese stocks curbed gains. Komatsu Ltd, the world's second-biggest maker of construction machinery after Caterpillar Inc, jumped more than 4 percent after government data showed Japanese companies raised spending on plant and equipment by a greater-than-expected 13.6 percent in January-March. Mitsui OSK Lines and other shipping firms steamed ahead following Credit Suisse upgrades. While some agreed that the market is ready to aim higher, others said falls in China stocks and rises in Japanese government bond yields could keep investors from aggressively pushing prices higher. China's main stock index plunged a provisional 8.3 percent on Monday after the government hiked the share trading tax last week to cool feverish speculation. "The Chinese market does not have much liquidity and when it moves, it moves in one direction. Any big swings should fuel concerns about global money investing in emerging markets and other risky assets," said Norihiro Fujito, general manager at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities Co Ltd's investment research and information division. The Nikkei added 14.54 points to 17,973.42, the highest close since Feb 27. The broader TOPIX index gained 0.28 percent to 1,772.84. "The market seems to be on an upward momentum and economic data is showing good numbers," said Fujio Ando, senior managing director at Chibagin Asset Management. "Investors should return to Japanese stocks from emerging markets" given the strong fundamentals, he added. Seeking higher returns, retail investors have poured trillions of yen into investment trust funds that invest in the BRIC nations -- Brazil, Russia, India and China. Trade volume grew, with 2.6 billion shares changing hands, compared with last week's daily average of 2 billion shares. Advancing shares outnumbered decliners by 913 to 673. Shares of Toyota climbed 1.2 percent to 7,550 yen after data showed that Japan's top automaker shot past all its rivals with a 10 percent gain in US car sales in May. Amid growing expectations that a Bank of Japan rate hike may come in the next quarter, yields on government bonds rose, making them an attractive financial instrument compared with equities, Fujito of Mitsubishi UFJ Securities said. The two-year yield for instance, rose as high as 0.995 percent before easing to 0.990 percent, with traders eyeing a rise above 1.0 percent for the first time in 10 years. "Tokyo Electric Power has a dividend yield of around 1.5 percent, but if the two-year government bond, a risk-free financial instrument, is yielding 1 percent, stocks could be losing their allure," he said referring to Japan's largest private electric power company. Japanese companies are trying to pay out more dividends but the average forecast dividend yield for the Nikkei 225 components remains low at about 1 percent. Among shippers, Mitsui OSK rose 4.2 percent to 1,768 yen and Nippon Yusen KK surged 5.2 percent to 1,193 yen. Credit Suisse upgraded shares of Nippon Yusen to outperform from neutral and raised target prices for it and its peers. Meanwhile, Japan's leasing company Orix Corp said after the market closed that it would buy Japanese Internet firm Internet Research Institute Inc (IRI) in a deal worth about 10.6 billion yen. The Japan Iron and Steel Federation announced Friday that Japan's steel exports rose 9.9 percent in April in terms of volume, after a 3.6 percent drop in March, helping steel shares. JFE Holdings gained 3 percent to 7,790 yen and Nippon Steel Corp climbed 1.1 percent to 892 yen. Decliners included NTT DoCoMo Inc which fell 1.5 percent to 204,000 yen after HSBC cut its rating on Japan's largest mobile phone operator to "underweight" from "neutral"
