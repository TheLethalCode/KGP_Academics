 NEW DELHI, June 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hundreds of protesters from the Gujjar community demanding special government privileges blocked some highways leading to New Delhi on Monday, clashing with police and burning two buses. This is the seventh day of protests by ethnic Gujjars, who are demanding they be declared a Scheduled Tribe (ST) which will entitle them to government jobs and college seats. Twenty-three people have been killed in Rajasthan. Police said protesters had congregated along at least four major highways and were attempting to block traffic into New Delhi, adding there were sporadic clashes between police and demonstrators in some areas. "Thousands of police and paramilitary forces have been deployed and are patrolling all major roads leading to the capital," said Deependra Pathak, chief spokesman for Delhi police. "We will do whatever it takes to ensure peace and security." Local television stations showed two buses burning and protesters throwing stones at police. Other demonstrators waved sticks, held hands and blocked roads, causing massive traffic jams in many areas. A Reuters witness said a highway from the satellite town of Noida into New Delhi was also blocked in parts by protesters who were burning effigies of Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, who they accuse of ignoring their demands. Protesters also disrupted rail traffic near New Delhi in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh. An official said two passenger trains were stopped after protesters blocked the tracks. The protests by the Gujjars, a community of shepherds and farmers, began last week in Rajasthan and were fuelled after police shot dead 14 Gujjars during a clash on Tuesday. Gujjar anger has since spread to other parts of the country where they have sizeable populations, including New Delhi. But their demands are strongly opposed by the Meenas, a powerful community in Rajasthan who have cornered a large slice of the existing tribal quota for government jobs and college places in the state. The Gujjar protests have led to violent clashes between the two groups, leading to several deaths. Gujjar leaders were expected to continue talks with Raje on Monday to discuss the community's demands
