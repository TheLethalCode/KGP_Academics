 LONDON, June 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares ticked up early on Tuesday, helped by a recovery in Asia on talk that Chinese authorities may issue a reassuring policy statement and by record US closing highs, which offset uncertainty over interest rates. At 0810 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 0.1 percent at 1,623.82 points, led by oil and gas producers, which were supported by Brent crude staying above $70 a barrel. Britain's United Utilities rose 4 percent to lead European gainers after it put its electricity distribution assets up for sale and posted strong results. French carmaker Renault climbed 3 percent after Deutsche Bank raised its price target for the stock, and insurer Standard Life gained 4.2 percent after Merrill Lynch upgraded it to "buy". But budget airline Ryanair fell nearly 6 percent as it warned of a slowdown despite posting better-than-expected full-year net profits, and Daily Mail fell on a Morgan Stanley downgrade. Analysts said that stock valuations in Europe had gone up too much for equities to remain a good bet, with interest-rate increases lurking. Morgan Stanley strategist Teun Draaisma said the outlook for shares in the next six months was not very good, and interest rates posed the biggest threat. "The mid-cycle slowdown, during which growth slows and rates go lower, is over. US 10-year bond yields are approaching 5 percent, which is dangerous, and valuations in Europe are too expensive," he said. "What we're saying is: take profits on your equity overweights and go back to neutral. Stay in cash and underweight on bonds." The European Central Bank is expected to raise rates to 4 percent at a meeting on Wednesday, while the Bank of England is seen keeping rates constant on Thursday, though most analysts see rates going up by the end of the third quarter. Euro zone services growth rose at a marginally faster rate than expected in May with employment at a 11-month high, while price pressures eased, a survey showed. Investors are also waiting for retail data from the region for clues to the strength of the economy. Chinese shares recovered to be up 2.6 percent on rumours that authorities would make a policy statement to restore investor confidence, after a 7 percent slide earlier in the day. A fall in Chinese stocks at the end of February sparked a short but sharp slide in global equities. But a mix of strong results, economic growth and merger and acquisition activity has helped take the FTSEurofirst 300 up by 9.4 percent so far this year. Draaisma said possible triggers for a fresh fall could include a widening in credit spreads, the hurricane season and oil price movements, and possibly China. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 was up 0.14 percent, outperforming Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40, which were slightly negative
