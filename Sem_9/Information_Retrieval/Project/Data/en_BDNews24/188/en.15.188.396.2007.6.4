 AIN AL-HILWEH, Lebanon, June 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Islamist militants attacked Lebanese troops at a second Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon on Monday, killing two soldiers and threatening to plunge the country into long-term instability. The clashes, that broke out on Sunday at an entrance to the sprawling Ain al-Hilweh camp, appeared to be an attempt to open a new front in the south against the army and ease pressure on al Qaeda-inspired fighters at Nahr al-Bared in north Lebanon. Apart from the two Lebanese soldiers, one civilian and two militants were also killed at Ain al-Hilweh, Lebanon's biggest camp, security and military sources said. Witnesses said fighters of the Sunni Muslim militant Jund al-Sham group had been involved in clashes with Lebanese troops three times since Sunday night. Three soldiers and two civilians had also been wounded in the fighting, started by the gunmen. Jund al-Sham is a very small group that has sided with Fatah al-Islam, the group fighting the army at Nahr al-Bared, though there are no apparent organisational links between the two. "The (army leadership) indicates that attacks on the army by armed groups are persisting from the Palestinian camps," the Lebanese army said in a statement late on Sunday. "It urges all Palestinian factions and Lebanese politicians to take a decisive stand so that these camps do not become a source of civil strife that aims to hit the nation's stability." In north Lebanon, troops pounded Nahr al-Bared sporadically throughout the night. Fatah al-Islam fighters have so far refused to give up their weapons or surrender, putting up stiff resistance despite being vastly outgunned and outnumbered. Since Friday, the army had conducted an intensive assault on Fatah al-Islam positions at the camp's entrances with the aim of wiping out the militants. The violence, which erupted on May 20, is Lebanon's worst internal fighting since the 1975-1990 civil war. At least 113 people have died and about 25,000 of Nahr al-Bared's 40,000 refugees have fled due to worsening humanitarian conditions. The government sees the fighting as a battle against terrorists and accuses the militants of sparking fighting by attacking army positions near the camp and in Lebanon's second largest city, Tripoli. The troops have seized and destroyed several positions of the Fatah al-Islam group and tightened their siege of the camp, which lies 100 km (60 miles) north of Beirut. But the militants were hitting back with grenades, mortar bombs and sniper fire. At least 10 soldiers have died since Friday in Nahr al-Bared, bringing the military death toll there to 44. More than 20 people -- militants and civilians -- have died in the camp since. Fatah al-Islam said it lost five fighters and about 36 in total. Lebanon's anti-Syrian government says Fatah al-Islam is a Syrian tool. But Damascus denies any links to the group and says its leader, Shaker al-Abssi, is on Syria's wanted list. Lebanon has also been split by a seven-month-old political crisis over the opposition's demands for more say in government. The opposition includes Syria's allies, led by Hezbollah. While the army has not entered the camp's official boundaries, it has captured the militants' positions on its outskirts, confining militants to about a third of the camp. A 1969 agreement prevents the army from entering Lebanon's 12 Palestinian camps, home to 400,000 refugees
