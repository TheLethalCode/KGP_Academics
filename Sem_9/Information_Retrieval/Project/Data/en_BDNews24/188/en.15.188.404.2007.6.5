<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 5 (bdnews24.com)Former prime minister Khaleda Zia's son Tarique Rahman Tuesday appealed to the High Court for division in jail. The High Court will hear the appeal Thursday. Division facilities are given to high-profile inmates. Tarique, also senior joint secretary general of the BNP, is now living with ordinary inmates in Dhaka Central Jail. Barrister Nasiruddin Ahmed Asim moved the appeal with the HC bench of Justice SK Sinha and Justice Mamnun Rahman on behalf of Tarique. Tarique was arrested on March 7 and taken to court on March 12 after a four-day remand. He also appealed for division to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court. The court then asked jail authorities to take "necessary steps" in line with the Jail Code. "But the jail authorities took no action," the appeal said. Justifying the appeal, the lawyer said Tarique is the eldest son of the late president Ziaur Rahman and Khaleda. Tarique's lawyer said his client could be given division taking into account his social status under Article 920 of the Jail Code. bdnews24.
