 Dhaka, June 5 (bdnews24.com) - Habibul Bashar Tuesday said he was "disappointed and surprised" to have lost Test captaincy, but the former captain now wanted to shore up his batting. "Certainly I was a bit disappointed and surprised after learning the news that I have lost my Test captaincy," Bashar told bdnews24.com Tuesday. He arrived from India after attending a programme of this year's best Bangali, organised by Indian satellite channel Star Ananda. The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) on June 2 appointed Mohammad Ashraful as new Bangladesh captain for both Tests and one-dayers and Mashrafee Bin Mortaza his deputy. "I hoped that someone from the board would inform me of the matter officially, but I got the news from a journalist," said Bashar, who stepped aside from the one-day captaincy after the home series against India last month. "Anyway I am not thinking about it and now want to concentrate on batting," said the Bangladesh most successful captain. "I have played under pressure for over three years when I was captain, but it was not at all a problem for me. "Yes, I am now more or less free from the pressure [without captaincy] and want to enjoy my own game," said Bashar when asked whether he thought he could play his natural game without the pressure of captaincy. "To be honest, the captaincy was never a big deal for me. I tried to discharge the responsibility of captaincy offered to me by the board," the 34-year old said. "Now I will try to improve myself and I am confident about it." "Frankly, I didn't think much about my exclusion from the Test squad. I enjoyed the programme in India and they gave me huge honour." The top-order batsman said he greeted Ahsraful after hearing the news. "I greeted Ashraful through an SMS from India as I could not reach him despite trying many times." "Ashraful phoned me and I told him he would be a successful captain. I would help him as much as possible from my position," Bashar said. bdn
