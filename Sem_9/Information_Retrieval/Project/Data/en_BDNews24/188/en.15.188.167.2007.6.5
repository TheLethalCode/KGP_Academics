 ABUJA, June 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nigeria's new Senate elected a retired general as its president on Tuesday, endorsing a controversial choice made by former head of state Olusegun Obasanjo the day before he stepped down last week. Many critics saw Obasanjo's last-minute decision to back David Mark, who supported a failed attempt last year to keep Obasanjo in power longer, as evidence the outgoing president intended to keep influencing public affairs. Obasanjo handed over power to Umaru Yar'Adua last Tuesday, but many Nigerians suspect he means to use his successor as a puppet. The vote for Senate president was seen as a test of Obasanjo's lingering influence. At the Senate's inaugural session on Tuesday, Mark won the election by 68 votes to 39 for his only opponent. In the lower House of Representatives, Obasanjo's choice for speaker, Patricia Etteh, was elected unopposed. The president of the Senate is the third most senior figure in Nigeria after the president and the vice-president. Obasanjo's choice of a well-known loyalist for the post drew a barrage of criticism, with many commentators predicting the chamber would be corrupt and toothless under Mark's leadership. "David Mark is an embodiment of corruption in the National Assembly," said former senator Joseph Waku in an interview in Leadership newspaper. As a general, Mark served as a member of the army council that ruled Nigeria under dictator Ibrahim Babangida in the 1980s and early 1990s. He also served as military governor of northern Niger state and as a minister of communications. As a senator during the previous legislature, he was a vocal supporter of the doomed attempt to secure a third term for Obasanjo, during which legislators accused top party officials of offering bribes to push through a constitutional amendment. Obasanjo has denied he ever wanted a third term and denied offering inducements to rally support for the amendment. Mark's re-election as a senator in April is being challenged before a tribunal, with his opponents alleging massive vote-rigging in his senatorial district of central Benue state. "David Mark may call himself a senator these days, but I'm not so sure he can lay claim to being a true democrat," wrote columnist Muhammad Al-Ghazali in the Daily Trust newspaper. During Obasanjo's eight years in office, some of the staunchest opposition came from the Senate. In particular, it was the Senate that defeated the third term plan in May 2006. The previous Senate president, Ken Nnamani, emerged as a vocal opponent to Obasanjo and a figure of moral authority during the elections in April, when he spoke out against vote-rigging by the ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP). Obasanjo loyalists in the party hit back by calling Nnamani, a PDP leader, a coup-plotter and a reb
