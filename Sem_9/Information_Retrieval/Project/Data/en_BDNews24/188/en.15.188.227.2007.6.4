 VALLETTA, June 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Malta said on Monday it could not act as a policeman of the Mediterranean following criticism it was being too tough on illegal migrants trying to reach Europe by sea from Africa after several drowned this week. Reacting to a statement on Sunday by Europe's human rights chief, Malta said it always carried out its international search and rescue obligations and was sensitive to the needs of anyone in distress at sea. "The government of Malta remains committed to honour its responsibilities in full compliance of international law, it cannot however become the policeman of the Mediterranean. Malta cannot assume responsibility for those areas where it does not have, and cannot have, any jurisdiction," a government statement said. "The Maltese armed forces shall...continue to provide their search and rescue services to the best of their capabilities, and will continue to work in full collaboration with neighbouring states' rescue and coordination centres according to international conventions and agreements," it said. Thomas Hammarberg, the Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights, said on Sunday all governments should take seriously their individual responsibility for humanitarian assistance to irregular migrants and urged "the Maltese authorities to soften their stance on providing assistance to irregular migrants whose lives are in danger". Malta's government also denied it had refused to receive 21 corpses recovered at sea by a French frigate on Friday. It said the bodies were found in the Libyan search and rescue zone and it had therefore told the French captain to first raise the matter with the Libyan authorities. A Maltese patrol boat recovered 29 migrants on Saturday from a boat drifting 84 miles (135 km) off the island's coast, but Valletta argues it is not obliged under international law to take in migrants if they are in Libya's search and rescue area. Last week 27 shipwrecked Africans spent three days clinging to tuna nets in the Mediterranean while Malta and Libya argued over who should rescue them. They were eventually picked up by the Italian navy
