 SAN FRANCISCO, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - California lawmakers took their second step in as many days on Wednesday into the foreign policy arena by backing a bill that would allow the state's voters to call for withdrawing US troops from Iraq. The Democratic-led state Senate passed a bill that would put a measure on the most populous US state's February presidential primary ballot urging President George W Bush "to end the US occupation of Iraq and immediately begin the safe and orderly withdrawal of United States forces." The measure would also urge Bush and the US Congress to "provide the necessary diplomatic and nonmilitary assistance to promote peace and stability in Iraq and the Middle East." The bill authorising the measure for the ballot still requires a majority of votes in California's Democratic-led Assembly and Republican Gov Arnold Schwarzenegger's signature. Schwarzenegger spokesman Aaron McLear said the governor has not taken a position on the bill. McLear said Schwarzenegger supports a timeline for withdrawing US troops from Iraq while at the same time believes the United States must be victorious. On Tuesday, California's Assembly backed a bill by a Republican member calling for the state to divest investments in the California Public Employees' Retirement System and the California State Teachers' Retirement System -- the biggest and third biggest US pension funds respectively -- in foreign companies doing business in Iran. "California's taxpayers should not be investing in a country which funds terrorism," said Assemblyman Joel Anderson, the bill's author. The bill still needs a majority vote by state Senate and Schwarzenegger's signature. He has not taken a position on it, McLear said. The California Public Employees' Retirement System opposes the divestment bill, which would force the fund to divest an estimated $8 billion in holdings. Board members of the fund have said they are "gravely concerned" about terrorism but have a fiduciary duty to fund members to post returns. The biggest US pension fund has historically resisted divestment legislation but did dump holdings in South Africa in the 1980s over apartheid and last year its board banned investing in a handful of companies doing business in Sudan to protest human rights violations there
