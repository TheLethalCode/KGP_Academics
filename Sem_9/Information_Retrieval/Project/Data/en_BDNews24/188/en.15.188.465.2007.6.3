 Dhaka, June 3 (bdnews24.com)  Speakers at a discussion Sunday demanded trial of politicians and government officials with links to activities against public interest. They also demanded a white paper exposing five years of corruption in energy and power sectors. The National Committee for Protection of Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources, Power and Ports organised the dialogue "National Interests and Energy Policy" at the National Press Club. Nuruddin Mahmud Kamal, former chairman of the Power Development Board, presented a keynote paper. Professor Anu Mohammad, speaking at the discussion, said poverty could not be eradicated from the country due to a lack of strong policy, despite having adequate resources. He stressed proper utilisation of mineral resources for the development of the country instead of exporting them. "People should be given total ownership of the resources," he said. Anu Mohammad demanded that the authorities realise compensation for the Magurchhara and Tengratila blowouts. Any efforts to extract coal at Phulbari coalmine that would harm the environment must be stopped, he said. The keynote paper made 10 recommendations, including setting up power stations of 20 megawatts each under 70 units of the Rural Electrification Board that would generate 1400 megawatts in two years. bdnews
