 Dhaka, June 4 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh Monday signed an agreement with South Korea in the far-eastern nation's Gwacheon city to export workers, the foreign ministry said in a statement. Foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury, who is visiting South Korea, signed the memorandum of understanding, the Seoul-datelined statement said. South Korean labour minister Lee Sang-soo represented his country, as the emerging Asian economy needs overseas workers to keep its momentum in economic development. "The MoU will open up great potentials for Bangladeshi workers to come and work legally in South Korea," Iftekhar was quoted as saying by the statement. "We are planning to upgrade skills of our workers including in the Korean language in response to Korean demands," he said. "Bangladesh has the supply and Korea has the need; it is a matter of adjusting the two, which will be for our great mutual benefit." The foreign adviser and the South Korean labour minister held a formal meeting to discuss further cooperation before signing the memorandum. Iftekhar, who is leading a delegation to the Asian Cooperation Dialogue Ministerial Meeting in Seoul, also had formal talks Monday with his South Korean counterpart Song Min-soon. They reviewed the current Bangladesh-South Korea relations. Song Min-soon thanked the visiting adviser for approving Korean Export Processing Zones in the South Asian nation. Song Min-soon hoped it would ensure larger South Korean investment to Bangladesh, especially in energy and infrastructure. Iftekhar said Bangladesh is eager to welcome all sorts of economic cooperation from South Korea. Later in the day, the foreign adviser sat in a meeting with Japan's senior vice minister for foreign affairs Katsuhito Asano. Asano hailed the emergency government's reforms initiatives and promised to continue its support to Bangladesh. "Japan sees Bangladesh as a great and good friend, and is always ready to extend her every possible assistance," the statement quoted the Japanese minister as saying. Possibilities of further cooperation between the two countries in sectors such as infrastructure, water, energy and communications came up in the meeting. The adviser also assured the minister of supporting Japan in the United Nations on various issues. He attended a gathering of Bangladeshi community in Seoul. "We will make our best efforts to protect the interest of Bangladeshis in Korea," he told the expatriate Bangladeshis. bdnew
