 NAJAF, Iraq, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A local representative of Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the reclusive spiritual leader of Iraq's Shia majority, was gunned down outside his home, Sistani's office and police said on Wednesday. Raheem al-Hasnawi, who represented Sistani in the town of al-Mishkhab, 40 km (25 miles) north of the holy Shia city of Najaf, was killed late on Tuesday, they said. A spokesman for Sistani's office said three gunmen riding in a car shot Hasnawi outside his home in al-Mishkhab. "He was killed immediately," the spokesman said. An Iraqi security source said Hasnawi was shot in the head and chest. There was no immediate indication about who was responsible for the killing. Sistani is the sponsor of the ruling United Alliance bloc to which Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and other Shia political leaders belong. He is acknowledged as the patron of a delicately structured Shia political movement which also includes anti-American cleric Moqtada al-Sadr's political movement
