<TITLE> Former Cheney aide faces prison in CIA leak scandal </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, June 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The former top aide to Vice President Dick Cheney will find out on Tuesday how long he might spend in jail for lying and obstructing a probe related to the Bush administration's handling of the Iraq war. Though Lewis "Scooter" Libby faces a maximum of 25 years in prison, legal observers say he might never spend a night behind bars, thanks to a lengthy appeals process and a possible pardon from President George W Bush. The prosecutor in the case, Patrick Fitzgerald, has asked US District Judge Reggie Walton to impose a sentence of two and a half to three years; the federal probation office has recommended less than two years. Libby's charges grew out of a high-profile investigation into the leak of a CIA analyst's identity after her husband emerged as an early critic of the invasion of Iraq. CIA analyst Valerie Plame has testified that the unmasking destroyed her career. Nobody was charged with blowing her cover, but Libby, Cheney's former chief of staff, was found guilty of obstruction of justice, making false statements to the FBI and two counts of perjury. He was found not guilty of one charge of making false statements. Libby was one of several Bush administration officials who discussed Plame with reporters at a time when her employment status was classified. Fitzgerald did not charge Libby or anybody else with breaking laws related to the leak, but Libby's dishonesty with investigators made it more difficult to determine if any laws were broken, Fitzgerald argued last week. Libby's lawyers hope Walton will consider his lengthy government career and only impose probation. "It cannot be that a person who performed a thousand good acts merits a harsher sentence than someone who has lived for himself alone. Mr Libby deserves a credit, not a debit, for his service to the nation," Libby's lawyers wrote. Legal experts say any prison sentence is likely to be suspended as Libby's lawyers appeal his case. That process could last until nearly the end of Bush's presidential term, at which point Bush would be free of the political pressures that might otherwise prevent him from issuing a pardon. "I find it very plausible that we're going to see a pardon right in that window after the election and before the president leaves office," said Scott Fredricksen, a former government lawyer
