 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) in line with the FIFA instruction is going to form independent football associations (FA) at divisional and district levels to keep it free from governmental interference. The BFF highups sought the cooperation of the government in carrying out the FIFA instruction as it needs to amend the National Sports Council (NSC) act to separate the proposed football association from the District Sports Council (DSA). "As the BFF majority councillors (70 councillors) come from the committees at divisional and district levels , there is apparent control of government on those committees, the FIFA wants to keep it free from the government's control," said BFF general secretary Anwarul Haq Helal at a press conference at BFF conference room Wednesday. "The BFF should be not only a fully democratic institution run on statutes in line with the FIFA principle, but also a structure whose roots lay in local football in all divisions and districts," said a FIFA statement provided by BFF. It also said, "However, we have observed that the current divisional and district associations of the BFF are not the only sections meant for football. FIFA and AFC are strongly of the opinion that the BFF-affiliated members at divisional and district levels must be local independent football associations." The BFF executive committee meeting on Tuesday formed a five-member committee headed by Anwarul Haq to discuss the issue with DSAs and government delegations. The FIFA, governing body of world football, also extended the expired BFF committee for a one-year mandate to April 30, 2008 to implement their prescriptions before holding its general election. According the FIFA guidelines, the BFF will draft a 'standard statutes' for the divisional and district football associations and will approve the draft from the FIFA and the AFC. Later, the BFF will form divisional and district football associations through 'constitutive general meetings at local levels and hold elections according to these statutes. On completion of the elections of local football associations, the BFF would hold its election under FIFA and AFC supervision. The Fakhruddin Ahmed-led caretaker government in February formed 25 ad-hoc committees at divisional and district levels, dissolving expired and previous ad-hoc committees to bring the real organisers into the sports arena. Some quarters in the football arena strongly believe that some one of the BFF- expired committee led by SA Sultan had convinced the FIFA that government was interfering in the process of the BFF election, which was scheduled to be held on June 23, but it was now postponed as instructed by the FIFA . But, the BFF president denied the allegation saying that FIFA often receives different kinds of letters from sports lovers in the country. Replying to a query, SA Sultan said, "The BFF should bear all expenses of the local football associations if the government does not agree to endorse the fund for football separately at local levels." The BFF boss, however, believes that it is possible to implement the FIFA and AFC instructions within six to eight months if all quarters come forward to help them.
