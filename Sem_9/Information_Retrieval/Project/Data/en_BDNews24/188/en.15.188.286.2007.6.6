 CANBERRA, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia's most wanted fugitive, a convicted drug mobster linked to the murder of a rival drug lord, has been arrested by police in Greece after more than a year on the run. Tony Mokbel, known as "Fat Tony", was being held in an Athens jail and Australian police on Wednesday said they would seek his extradition to complete a nine year minimum jail sentence for trafficking cocaine. "He is currently in the custody of Greek authorities, where he will remain until extradition proceedings are finalised," Victorian state Police Commissioner Christine Nixon told reporters in Melbourne. Mokbel, who is reported to have fled Australia dressed as a priest, faces trial at home where authorities allege he ordered and paid for the murder of crime boss Lewis Moran in a Melbourne club in 2004. Police had posted a A$1 million ($833,000) reward for information leading to his arrest. Mokbel's arrest in an Athens cafe came as police raided 22 properties in Victoria, which led to the arrest of eight men suspected to be part of a drug trafficking and financing network still controlled by Mokbel. "We believe that Mokbel was directing and organising production and distribution of drugs overseas, was in regular contact with associates in Melbourne and associates in Victoria (who were) distributing cash proceeds of drug sales to him using international banking accounts and cash transfers," Nixon said. Greek police have laid immigration and false document charges against Mokbel, who was shown in police photographs heavily disguised by a dark beard and long black hair. Australia will have 45 days to outline its case for extradition to Greek authorities once the fugitive is served with an arrest warrant. Moran's death in 2004 was one of a string of gang murders which left 28 people dead over 10 years in a tit-for-tat drugs turf war in Melbourne, Australia's second largest city. Gangster Carl Williams in May was sentenced to 35 years in jail after pleading guilty to the murders of Moran, his son Jason, and crime figure Mark Mallia. Williams is also serving 21 years in jail for the murder of another Melbourne drug dealer. Lewis Moran's widow Judy said she toasted Mokbel's arrest on Wednesday with a hot cup of coffee. "All these predators have to pay the price for the carnage they have caused, especially Mr Mokbel and his co-accused," Judy Moran told Australian radio
