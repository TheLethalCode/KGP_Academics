<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 4(bdnews24.com)- ACC chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury Monday said there was no lack of coordination among the officials involved in the crushing anti-graft drive. "There's no lack of coordination among us," Mashhud told reporters amid allegations that anti-graft officials dealing with high-profile corruption lack understanding with various agencies. "Though belated, it has been proved that we don't lack coordination anymore," he said after a meeting of the National Coordination Committee on Serious Crimes at the commission's office. "We'll continue to hold this kind of meeting for better coordination." On whether investigations into the reported possession of several luxury cars by an adviser would be ordered, the ACC boss said: "First ask for wealth statements of the owners of newspapers and television channels, and then decisions could be made about the advisers." Asked if the meeting decided to allot NAM flats to the officials who would join the ACC on deputation, Mashhud said: "Forty-one officials are already working with the joint taskforce. The meeting has decided to solve their housing problem." bdnew
