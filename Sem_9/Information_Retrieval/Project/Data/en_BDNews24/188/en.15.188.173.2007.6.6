<TITLE> Former players get behind struggling West Indies </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MANCHESTER, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Stand-in captain Daren Ganga said on Wednesday that support from former West Indies players has given the team a much-needed boost after coming off their heaviest test defeat of all time. West Indies, 1-0 down, start the third and penultimate test of their series in England on Thursday after losing by an innings and 283 runs at Headingley where captain Ramnaresh Sarwan injured his shoulder and had to leave the tour. Ganga is trying to keep morale high despite West Indies being without a test win overseas since 2000, excluding victories against lowly-ranked Zimbabwe and Bangladesh. They have won just once in their last 27 tests anywhere. The record is a far cry from the 15-year period from 1980 to 1995 when West Indies were unbeaten in a series home or away. Many of the players from that era are now lending their help. "We spoke to Brian Lara in the first test match and I have had discussions with Desmond Haynes, Viv Richards, Michael Holding and Ian Bishop," Ganga told reporters. "These former players have come forward and given their help and advice to the team." Injured Sarwan will be replaced by fellow experienced Guyanese middle-order batsman Shivnarine Chanerpaul, who is now fit after missing the second test with a knee injury. Ganga also hinted there might be more changes, clearly conscious that his bowlers have allowed England's batsmen to rack up more than 500 in both of their first innings in the games so far. He indicated that after Steve Harmison's 11 wickets against Pakistan on the ground last year, there should be more pace, which could favour their fastest bowler Fidel Edwards. All-rounder Darren Sammy and Sarwan's replacement on the tour, Marlon Samuels, are also in contention. England on Sunday picked the same team as in the second test. Captain Michael Vaughan is bidding to become the most successful England test captain of all time. He is currently level on 20 wins with Peter May
