<TITLE> Bush stays supportive of embattled Musharraf </TITLE>

 WASHINGTON, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - His people may be turning against him but Pervez Musharraf, an army general turned Pakistani president, still has a loyal ally in George W Bush. The US president and top aides remain largely uncritical of Musharraf's handling of a political crisis in his nuclear-armed state, even as US analysts, major newspapers and some officials voice new fears about the possibility of prolonged chaos or a coup. Given Pakistan's role as a front-line partner in the anti-terror war, the risk of miscalculation at this volatile time could be as great for Washington as Islamabad. One respected former US official, who spoke anonymously due to the sensitivity of the topic, told Reuters he is more worried about Pakistan's instability than Iran's nuclear ambitions. Critics say that by aligning so closely with Musharraf, Bush undermines the credibility of the United States as a democracy symbol, alienates Pakistanis who may one day lead the country and emboldens a leader who, if he survives, almost certainly will emerge weakened from the crisis. "The United States is supporting one man against what appears to be a majority of Pakistanis," said Christine Fair, a South Asia expert at the United States Institute of Peace. "It's not good to have a relationship with a leader who ... enjoys so little legitimacy. But there are no signs of an alternative strategy," she said in an interview. "The United States sees Musharraf under attack and they are doing what they can to bolster him." Bush, bogged down with Iraq, Iran and North Korea, is keen to avoid new crises 18 months before his term ends. Bush and top aides have convinced themselves, with Musharraf's help, that if Musharraf is ousted, Islamic radicalism will spread in Pakistan and his successor will not cooperate as well with Washington in rooting out al Qaeda and Taliban forces on the Afghan border, Fair said. "That's nonsense," she added. Musharraf, who is seeking reelection, triggered the biggest challenge to his authority since taking power in a bloodless coup in 1999 with his suspension three months ago of Pakistan's chief justice. As street protests widened, the government responded forcibly against demonstrators and curbed broadcast media. "There is no security with General Musharraf. The United States belongs on the side of Pakistani democracy," the New York Times declared in a recent editorial. In sharp contrast to his pariah status after the 1999 coup, Musharraf won Bush's embrace after the Sept 11 attacks on the United States in 2001 for signing onto the US military campaign in Afghanistan and for efforts to turn his country into a moderate Islamic state, which now seem threatened. Speaking to reporters on a European trip on Wednesday, Bush said he would like to see "free and fair elections" in Pakistan but was gentle on Musharraf, saying that "in terms of the democracy issues, he's going to have to deal with it." Bush argued democracy is more established in Pakistan than in some other countries, dismissed criticism of Musharraf as "posturing" associated with the upcoming elections and urged impatient critics to give democracy more time to take root. Assistant Secretary of State Richard Boucher, who oversees South Asia, plans to visit Islamabad next week. A senior US defence official is also expected to go there soon. What message they would carry has not been decided. The US assessment of Pakistan is under review but a senior US official cautioned: "I wouldn't overplay this. We don't know what is going to emerge from it." With the United States and Pakistan's military in his corner, Musharraf could remain in office, experts say. But if he declares emergency rule -- provoking more protests and a wider crackdown -- all bets are off. "US policy towards Pakistan has been a catastrophe," including the failure to insist on a long-term strategy to extract the military from politics, said Stephen Cohen, a Brookings Institution scholar and author of "The Idea of Pakistan." "We're now asking for too much too late. We're urging free and open elections. That's the last thing Musharraf might do," Cohen told Reuters. "He's afraid it might lead to chaos and he might be right. You need a government that binds a country together before you can afford an election.
