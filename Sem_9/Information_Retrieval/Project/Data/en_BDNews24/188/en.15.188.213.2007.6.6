 BAGHDAD, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least seven people were killed and 25 wounded when bombs in two parked cars exploded in quick succession in a Shi'ite district in northeastern Baghdad on Wednesday, police said. The cars were parked by the roadside near a central square in Kadhimiya. The bombs went off about two minutes apart, police said. The first exploded close to al-Zahra square, a commercial area in central Kadhimiya. The second bomb exploded near a parking lot, commonly used by shoppers, close to a women's jail. Thousands of extra US and Iraqi troops have been deployed in Baghdad and other areas as part of a security crackdown aimed at averting all-out sectarian civil war between majority Shias and minority Sunni Arabs dominant under Saddam Hussein. US military officials have said those forces now control about a third of Baghdad's neighbourhoods. The crackdown began in mid-February. The number of targeted sectarian killings fell during the early stages of the crackdown but has begun to rise again, military officials say. Large-scale bombings, many blamed on Sunni Islamist al Qaeda, remain common
