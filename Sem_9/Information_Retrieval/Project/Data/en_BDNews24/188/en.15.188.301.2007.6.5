 Dhaka, June 5 (bdnews24.com)  An Awami League worker Tuesday accused former prime minister Khaleda Zia of having a hand in bloody grenade attacks on her archrival Sheikh Hasina in 2004. A case was filed against 28 people, including Khaleda's son Tarique Rahman and coalition partner and Jamaat-e-Islami chief Motiur Rahman Nizami on allegations of attacking an Awami League rally that left 24 people dead. Cox's Bazar Awami League worker Badar Aziz Uddin, who was injured in the attacks, filed the case with the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court in Dhaka. The attacks that took place on Bangabandhu Avenue on Aug 21, 2004 were extraordinary even by the bloody standards of Bangladesh. The accused also included Jamaat secretary general Ali Ahsan Mujahid, former minister for housing and public works Mirza Abbas, Khaleda's adviser Hannan Shah, Rajshahi city mayor Mizanur Rahman Minu, former state minister Lutfozzaman Babar, former minister for telecommunications Barrister Aminul Haque, BNP leader Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury, former state minister Salahuddin Ahmed and other BNP leaders Mosaddek Ali Falu, Amanullah Aman and Barkatullah Bulu, A controversial businessman with ties to the BNP, Giasuddin Al Mamun, former BNP MP Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu, Bogra BNP leader Helaluzzaman Talukder, Jamaat assistant secretary general Abdul Kader Mollah, Krishak Dal general secretary Shahjahan Miah, former BNP MP Shahidul Haq Jamal and BNP Dhaka city leader Chowdhury Alam have also been named in the case. Besides, former NSI chief Rezzakul Haider, former inspector general of police Modabbir Hossain, former additional director general of CID Faruk Ahmed, former Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner Khoda Boksh and two senior officials of Islami Bank face the allegations. Nine people have been made witness to the case and more than 100 people have been made unnamed witnesses. The nine witnesses are Badar Aziz Uddin, Awami League presidium member Abdur Razzak, AL health affairs secretary Dr Mostafa Jalal Mohiuddin, labour secretary Habibur Rahman Miraj, organising secretary Saber Hossain Chowdhury, Muktijoddha Sanghati Parishad chairman Shawkat Ali, Golam Mostafa of Narayanganj, Maulana Alim Uddin of Cox's Bazar and Mohammad Razia of Sabujbag in Dhaka.

According to case details, the accused who were leaders of the then ruling alliance, destroyed important evidence immediately after the incident to save criminals. They also hid the CD and videocassettes transmitted on the NTV after the incident. Although an attempt was made to file a case with Ramna Police Station in this connection, the police did not record the case. Investigation officers have not yet been able to make an arrest. bdnews24
