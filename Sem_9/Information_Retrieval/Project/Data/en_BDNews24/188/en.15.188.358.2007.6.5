<TITLE> Budget for development of RMG workers unused </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 05 (bdnews24.com) -- Nothing of the Tk 20 crore budgetary allocation for development of readymade garment workers has been used this fiscal year. The same was the case in the previous two fiscal years. As much as Tk 20 crore and Tk 30 crore, allocated for fiscal 2005-06 and 2004-05 respectively, also remained totally unused. Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association asked the government to devise ways to utilise the allocation for the sake of the garment sector. "We've asked the government to utilise the fund either by itself or by the BGMEA," Anwar-UL-Alam Chowdhury, president of BGMEA told bdnews24.com Tuesday. He said who would give the money for whom was not clear in the budget. He said that the RMG industry was facing about 30 percent scarcity of skilled manpower, both at the mid-level and workers' level. 635-sweater factories alone were facing shortage of about 60,000 people, which he said was hampering growth potentials of the industry. But the budgetary allocation for skill development scheme has remained unused for years. "Sometimes it creates confusion about the necessity of the allocation," Chowdhury said. "This year we've proposed to utilise the fund either by the BGMEA Institute of Fashion and Technology (BIFT) or by the government vocational training institutes," he said. He said that the RMG industry was facing growing competition from its global competitors and manpower shortage could harm the industry badly. BIFT is generating 160 trained people a month, but it is too inadequate to meet the necessity, the BGMEA president said. He said that Bangladesh has the potential to earn US$ 15 billion to $18 billion a year from export of RMG products within the next three years if the government helped address the problems, including manpower and infrastructure constraints. Exports had fetched $10.5 billion in 2005-06, registering about 22 percent growth over that in 2004-05. Of the total, 76 percent was from RMG export. Export earning target for the current fiscal year has been set at $12.5 billion, projecting a 19 per cent growth. The export earnings in the first 10 months of the current fiscal year were $9.9 billion. bd
