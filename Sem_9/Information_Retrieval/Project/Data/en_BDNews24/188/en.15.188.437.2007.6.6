<TITLE> Kazakh parliament takes step towards dissolution </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ASTANA, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kazakhstan's lower house of parliament took a first step towards early elections on Wednesday, seeking to enforce constitutional amendments proposed by President Nursultan Nazarbayev. The Central Asian nation's opposition has criticised most of the amendments as undemocratic in a country which has yet to hold elections judged free and fair by foreign monitors. In the first step towards dissolving parliament ahead of the polls, a group of deputies sent a request to the Constitutional Council asking it to clarify the procedure. Parliament, which contains only one opposition member, has already rubber-stamped most of the reform package -- which also includes a clause waiving presidential terms for Nazarbayev. Lawmakers, however, need to dissolve the chamber and call early polls so a new parliament can be elected that adheres to the new constitutional amendments. Regular parliamentary elections are not due until 2009. Several government sources have told Reuters the early poll could happen as soon as August 26. According to the constitution early elections must take place within 2 months of dissolution. The United States has praised the overall reform package as a positive step but has not directly commented on clauses disputed by the Kazakh opposition. The amendments raise the number of deputies to 107 from 77 and require all seats be filled from party lists -- a move the opposition has said would secure the overwhelming victory of the pro-Nazarbayev Nur-Otan party. The fragmented opposition has accused Nazarbayev, 66 and in power since 1989, of violating human rights and holding too much power as head of state. Last month Nazarbayev ordered police to investigate his son-in-law Rakhat Aliyev, who had declared he wanted to run for president in 2012. Aliyev, accused of kidnap and running a crime network, was arrested by Austrian police on Friday
