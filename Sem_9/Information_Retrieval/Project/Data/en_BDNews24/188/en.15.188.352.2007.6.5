 NAIROBI, June 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kenyan police cordoned off a Nairobi slum on Tuesday to hunt suspected members of Kenya's Mungiki gang who gunned down two officers. Police with dogs and assault rifles stormed Nairobi's Mathare slum, a stronghold of the outlawed gang behind a series of killings and beheadings of ordinary citizens, and increasingly government officials. Police spokesman Eric Kiraithe said the Mathare operation, which began on Monday night, had captured seven prime suspects, but he declined to comment on local media reports saying as many as 22 people were killed in the sweep. "We are purging the place," Kiraithe said. "There are some people who have resisted the police cordon and search operation. ... I cannot confirm any casualties. We do not comment on ongoing operations." The death toll could not be immediately verified. One Mathare resident, who declined to be identified, said some people had died. "I hear four people have been killed," he said. "There was a lot of mayhem last night. Young men were rounded up and beaten senseless by policemen. Many are limping today." Gunmen ambushed the two officers in Mathare late on Monday, after dropping leaflets warning that any attempting to guard bus stations would be killed. Internal Security Minister John Michuki ordered police to man the stations around the clock to stop Mungiki from extorting and threatening operators and passengers of Kenya's ubiquitous matatus, the local name for minibuses. Mungiki makes most of its money from extorting matatu operators -- a lucrative racket since the the government says the buses nationwide earn more than 90 million Kenya shillings ($1.35 million) per day. The Mungiki, which means "multitude" in the Kikuyu tribal language, emerged in the 1990s as a quasi-religious sect. It touted itself as having inherited the mantle of the Mau Mau rebels, also a largely Kikuyu group that fought the British colonial government before independence in 1963. But Mungiki later turned to violence and extortion, and it has links to wealthy families and politicians -- many of whom in Kenya's past have not shied from hiring muscle to ensure elections go their way. That has raised fears they plan to play a violent role in Kenya's upcoming general elections in December. Attacks by the gang have become increasingly violent and in recent weeks villagers in central Kenya found severed heads placed poles and body parts scattered in bushes. They are also suspected of colluding with crooked police officers in exchange for a cut of their extortion schemes, and police have carried out major shake-ups in recent weeks to break the links. Michuki, a former colonial-era administrator with a penchant for tough talk, and President Mwai Kibaki have threatened to wipe out any members of Mungiki. The government banned it in 2002 after a wave of slayings in violence in Mathare. "The killing of policemen shows that these people are brazen," Kiraithe said. "We will only stop when you don't hear of Mungiki.
