 HONG KONG, June 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hong Kong people held more than ten thousand public meetings, marches and protests over the past five years, the city's police said on Tuesday, re-enforcing a popular view that the former British colony is a city of protests. From 2002 till 2006 -- 6,418 public meetings and 4,692 public processions, including protests had taken place, the police said in a statement to the city's legislature. An average of six events daily. No overall figure for total protests since 1997 was given. Hong Kong was once dubbed the "city of protests" by the New York Times, describing a trend of growing civic activism in the territory since reverting to Chinese rule almost ten years ago on July 1, 1997. In 2000, Hong Kong's then secretary for Justice, Elsie Leung wrote: "With over 6,000 public rallies since reunification (in 1997), Hong Kong has become known as the "city of protests". Analysts say discontent has spilled over in Hong Kong over a raft of livelihood and political issues, including a growing wealth gap, the denial of a minimum wage and Beijing's stalling of democratic reforms including direct elections. Protesters are largely free to operate in Hong Kong -- but are required by law to notify and seek permission from police before holding any demonstrations involving more than 30 people. "Even though there seem to be no restrictions, the police have absolute power to restrict the movement of protesters during rallies," said legislator Leung Kwok-hung, one of the city's most prolific protesters. On Monday evening, Hong Kong held one of its major annual protests -- a candlelight vigil to commemorate victims of the June 4 crackdown in Beijing in 1989, that drew 55,000 people. On July 1, 2003, over half a million people spilled onto the streets in one of the city's largest ever protest marches -- which opposed a raft of issues including a controversial anti-subversion draft law -- that was eventually scrapped
