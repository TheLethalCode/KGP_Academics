 Dhaka, June 4 (bdnews24.com)  Uncapped Mahmudullah Riyad was surprised to earn a call in the one-day squad for a three-match ODI series against Sri Lanka in July. "I did not expect an early call in the national squad, but I was confident that one day I would get a call. Anyway, now I want to prove my worth," Riyad told bdnews24.com by phone from his Mymensingh home. The selectors Monday announced a 15-member Test squad and named five one-day players for three-match Test series and as many one-day matches against Sri Lanka in June-July. The off-spinner, who bats right-handed in the middle-order, heard the news from a private TV channel. His friends celebrated by treating him to sweets. Riyad also hosted dinner for them. "I first learnt the news from a TV channel and then a few cricketers including Shahriar Nafees phoned me," said Riyad. The tall allrounder, also a player of BCB Academy team, played for Victoria Sporting Club in the premier cricket league, scoring 415 runs and taking seven wickets in 14 matches. He also had a successful stint with Bangladesh A team in Sri Lanka and at home. Riyad's inclusion means left-arm spinners are dominating Bangladesh's one-day and Test squads that have Abdur Razzak, Mohammad Rafiq and Saqib Al Hasan. The selectors however tried with off-spinners Fahim Muntasir and Jamaluddin Babu, but they could not do justice to their potential. "The selectors thought my inclusion would bring variety in the bowling attack and my aim now is to prove them right," said the 21-year old. Riyad, a BBA student of IBAIS University, is a fan of Muttiah Muralitharan. "I have been bowling off-spin since my school days for Mymensigh Zilla School, but I batted and bowled."
