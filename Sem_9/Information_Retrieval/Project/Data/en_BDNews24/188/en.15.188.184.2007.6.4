 MOSUL, Iraq, June 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gunmen murdered a Catholic priest and three assistants in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, which Pope Benedict condemned as a "senseless killing". Iraqi police said Chaldean Catholic priest Ragheed Aziz Kani and his assistants were killed near the church of Rouh al-Quds after leading Sunday prayers in eastern Mosul, 390 km (240 miles) north of Baghdad on Sunday.

Much of the violence in Iraq is sectarian between Shi'ite and Sunni Muslims but Christians have also been targeted. Human rights groups have warned that violence is driving minority Christians out of the country. The United Nations said in a report this year that, of the 1.5 million Assyrian Christians living in Iraq before 2003, half had fled the country and many of the rest were moving to "safe areas" in the north of Iraq.
