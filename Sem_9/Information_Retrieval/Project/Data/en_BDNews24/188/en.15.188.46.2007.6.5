 BAGHDAD, June 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Workers at the Oil Pipeline Company in southern Iraq began a strike on Monday demanding the government improve their financial remuneration, the company spokesman said. Faraj Mizban said about 600 workers are taking part in the strike and that they have shut two main pipelines which carry refined oil products to Baghdad and to the southern cities. Oil Ministry spokesman Asim Jihad said the strike will not have any effect on crude oil exports from the south, vital for Iraq's economy. "The workers have started a strike objecting to the lower yearly profit they get," he told Reuters. "It has caused a halt (to the flow) of oil products..to Nassiriya, Kerbala and Baghdad," he added. Mizban said the workers wanted an increase in their yearly profit from the company branch in Basra to be financially and administrativly independent from the centre in Baghdad
