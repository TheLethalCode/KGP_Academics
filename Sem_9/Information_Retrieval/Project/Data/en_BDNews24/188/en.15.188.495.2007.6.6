 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League Wednesday denied having a hand in Tuesday's case filed against former prime minister Khaleda Zia for the August 21 grenade attack on an AL rally. "We didn't know anything about the case. We don't have any relation with it. Someone filed the case personally. We came to know about it through the media," AL chief Sheikh Hasina's special assistant Dr Hasan Mahmud told reporters. Cox's Bazar Awami League worker Badar Aziz Uddin Tuesday filed the case against 28 people, including Khaleda's son Tarique Rahman and Jamaat-e-Islami chief Motiur Rahman Nizami on allegations of their links to the attack on the 2004 rally that left 24 people dead. Mahmud also said Hasina will place wreaths at the portrait of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Thursday to mark the historic six-point charter of demands. bdnews
