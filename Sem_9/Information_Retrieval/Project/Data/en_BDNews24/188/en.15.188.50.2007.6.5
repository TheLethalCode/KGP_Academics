 Dhaka, June 5 (bndews24.com)  The caretaker government looks set to widen the social safety net in the upcoming budget to speed up poverty reduction initiatives, finance ministry officials said. Both the allocation and the number of recipients will increase by 10 percent in the budget, they said. Allocations for social safety nets would be increased by Tk 80 crore to Tk 100 crore in the upcoming budget. The safety net comprises senior citizen allowance, allowance for destitute widows, honorarium programme for insolvent freedom fighters, assistance to fully retarded persons, seasonal unemployment reduction fund, test relief, food for works programme, gratuitous relief (GR), VGF and VGD. In FY 2006-07, the allocation for 'senior citizen allowance' was enhanced to Tk 200 from Tk 180 and the number of beneficiaries also rose to 16 lakh from 15 lakh a year ago. "Both the allowance and the number of recipients would increase in the upcoming budget by about 10 percent," a senior finance ministry official told bdnews24.com, requesting anonymity. About Tk 400 crore would be spent on the allowance during the current fiscal, which was Tk 324 crore in 2005-06. The government fixed the allowance for destitute widows at Tk 200 this fiscal from Tk 180 a year ago and increased the number of beneficiaries to 6.5 lakh in FY 2006-07 from 6.25 lakh in the previous year. Monthly allowance for a widow and beneficiaries would also rise from the current Tk 200 in the budget. About Tk 150 crore has been allocated for widows in the current budget. The beneficiary coverage under the honorarium programme for insolvent freedom fighters was enhanced to one lakh in the current fiscal year from 70 thousand in 2005-06. The number of beneficiaries under this category would also rise in the upcoming fiscal year. The assistance to the fully retarded persons numbering 1.4 lakh would also increase. Currently, fully retarded persons each receives a monthly allowance of Tk 200 against a total allocation of Tk 40 crore. A "seasonal unemployment reduction fund" of Tk 55 crore was created under non-development budget in FY 2006-07 to ease seasonal unemployment of the unprivileged poor people in some specific areas affected by natural and geographical constraints, specially in Monga-prone areas. This year the funding will be further enhanced, officials said. In addition, more food grains would be earmarked for rural infrastructure maintenance programme (test relief), food for works programme, gratuitous relief (GR), VGF and VGD. In FY 2006-07, some 10.57 lakh tonnes of food grains have been allocated for these programmes. Like the previous one, this budget will also increase the allocation for these programmes. Funds for housing the homeless could also rise in the upcoming budget to address the housing problems of the homeless, the poor and the low-income group, particularly the rural families. bdn
