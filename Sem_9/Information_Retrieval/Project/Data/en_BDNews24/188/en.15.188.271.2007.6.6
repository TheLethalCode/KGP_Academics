 KUALA LUMPUR, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Malaysia's prime minister plans to tie the knot this week for the second time, an aide said on Wednesday, less than two years after the premier's first wife died from breast cancer. Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, 67, will marry Jeanne Abdullah, 53, the manager of his official residence in the Malaysian administrative capital of Putrajaya, at a private function on Saturday, the aide told Reuters. "It's a ceremony for close relatives only," said the aide, who asked not to be named. Abdullah's future wife is a divorcee with two children.

They had two children, Kamaluddin and Nori
