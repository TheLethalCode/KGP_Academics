 Dhaka, Jun 5 (bdnews24.com) - Stocks ended a weeklong rally Tuesday as investors initiated a sell-off to lock in profits from the highly traded issues in the power, cement, pharmaceuticals and banking sectors. "It's a good sign. This nominal correction will encourage fresh buying into the market," said Moin Al Kashem, a market analyst. Investors passed a busy day as reflected in the volatility of the indices, though trading volume continued to look healthy. Power stocks, following about a month-long rally, fell due to profit-taking. Bank stocks closed mixed while IT stocks rallied. Cement shares also dropped. Turnover on the Dhaka Stock Exchange declined to Tk 1.79 billion from Monday's Tk 1.84 billion. Turnover increased, however, on the Chittagong Stock Exchange to Tk 306.84 million from Tk 287.34 million. Yawer Sayeed, chief executive of AIMS of Bangladesh, which manages approximately Tk 600 million in funds, observed the market as normal. "Considering the trading volume the market acted as normal, although we saw intra-day volatility in certain bullish sectors," he said. The DGEN or general index shed 10.61 points or 0.52 percent to 2006.82. The DSI or all-share price index plunged 10.39 points or 0.62 percent to 1655.40. The DSE-20 blue-chip index added 3.99 points or 0.22 percent to 1778.50. The CSE selective categories index fell. Other indices on the CSE finished high. Profit-taking led the shares of all the top scorers in turnover to close lower, except Southeast Bank, Pubali Bank and Prime Bank. Power Grid Company of Bangladesh, a top issue in turnover at Tk 259.72 million, declined 4.33 percent to share prices of Tk 606.25. Summit Power, second leader in turnover at Tk 149.97 million, slumped 9 percent to Tk 848.5. BRAC Bank ended lower at Tk 733.25, 1.70 percent down from previous day. Buying pressure pulled Southeast Bank shares to gain 2.88 percent to Tk 454.75. Square Pharma dipped 2.25 percent to Tk 3641.5. Information Services Network, Eastern Lubricants and Global Insurance led the gainers. Main losers were Summit Power, PLFSL and Singer Bangladesh. On the DSE, 62 issues advanced, 107 fell and 21 issues closed steady. On the CSE, 41 issues rose, 55 dropped and seven remained unchanged. bdn
