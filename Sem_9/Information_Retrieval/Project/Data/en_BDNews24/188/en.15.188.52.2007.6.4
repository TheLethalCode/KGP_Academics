 Dhaka, June 4 (bdnews24.com)  The government Monday allowed people to legalise untaxed money, starting Tuesday for the two months to July 31. People have to pay only 5 percent tax in penalty in addition to normal tax, the National Board of Revenue said in a circular making the rare move. "Different quarters have long been demanding the facility of legalising untaxed money," NBR chairman Badiur Rahman told reporters in his office Monday night. The circular excludes the "ill-gotten or black money" from the new facility. "The circular doesn't apply to the money earned by unfair means," Rahman said. He ruled out charges that the NBR had approved the whitening of black money through the new circular. The circular said persons, companies or other taxpayers who have failed to show their income, investment or any other assets in tax statements will be allowed to show their assets in two months from Tuesday. Untaxed money was legalised at a tax rate of mere 7.5 percent until the last fiscal year to the end of June 2006. According to NBR officials, some 7,000 people had taken the opportunity and whitened over Tk 4,000 crore. Under section 19B of the Income Tax Ordinance, 1984, one can invest black money or untaxed money in purchase or construction of building and apartment at a tax rate of Tk 300 per square metre for an area up to 200 square metre and Tk 500 for an area over 200 square metre. The areas are limited to Gulshan, Banani, Baridhara, Bashundhara, Dhanmondi and DOHS in Dhaka and Panchlaish and Khulshi in Chittagong. To keep the prevailing tax rates unchanged for other areas. The purchase of land under section 19BB of the ordinance is allowed at a tax rate of mere 7.5 percent for the current fiscal year, up from 5 percent last fiscal year without any binding to disclose his source of income. But the minimum tax rate for an honest payer is 10 percent. In the same manner, purchase of a motorcar under section 19BBB is allowed by giving tax rates at 10 percent and 15 percent based on the engine power of motorcars. The rates were 5 percent and 7.5 percent in fiscal 2005-06. bd
