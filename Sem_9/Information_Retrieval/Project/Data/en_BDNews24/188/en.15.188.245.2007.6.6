 SINGAPORE, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Most major Asian share markets inched lower and the dollar slipped on Wednesday, after comments from US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke dashed hopes for an interest rate cut this year in Asia's top export market. European markets were seen opening down, with financial bookmakers in London forecasting the FTSE 100 to open around 30 points lower, as several blue chips trade without the right to the latest dividend payout. Germany's Dax and France's Cac-40 were both seen opening up to 20 points lower. The dollar, already weak following Bernanke's comments, fell against the euro ahead of an expected European Central Bank interest rate increase as investors sought clues on how much higher they could go. The mood remained cautious as Chinese stocks -- which staged a dramatic recovery late on Tuesday after earlier dropping more than 7 percent -- continued to see-saw, leaving investors unsure over how steep and how long the correction may be. Shanghai's stock index opened higher and swung back and forth into negative territory, but was slightly calmed by reassurances from deputy central bank governor, Wu Xiaoling, that China's economy will not suffer from recent stock market volatility. By 0622 GMT, the Shanghai Composite Index was up 0.5 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.3 percent, while Taiwan's benchmark index was up 0.1 percent. Tokyo's Nikkei ended down 0.1 percent, dragged lower by exporters such as Canon Inc on concern over potentially slower US demand. MSCI's broadest index of Asian shares outside Japan was up 0.2 percent. Concerns that interest rates may rise in Japan kept Japanese government bond futures near 10-month lows at 132.47 while the yield on the JGB two-year rose to 1.005 percent for the first time in 10 years. The yield on the US Treasury benchmark 10-year hovered just below 5 percent. "Comments from the ECB could be a big mover for US bonds," said Hiroki Shimazu, a market economist at Mizuho Securities. "The Treasury market is also focusing on whether the ECB sends a signal about further rate tightening." The dollar slipped for a third day against the euro as traders waited on the post-meeting press conference with ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet for hints on how much rates may rise this year. By 0613 GMT the euro was at $1.3534 holding above an eight-week low of $1.3392 hit late last week as investors continued to pile into the currencies whose rates are seen rising, including the Australian dollar. The Aussie dollar surged to a 17-year peak against the US dollar after strong first-quarter growth data suggested rates could rise further, helping lift the New Zealand dollar to its highest since being floated in 1985. But the risk of higher rates helped send Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index 0.5 percent lower. Energy and commodity prices remained firm, with oil prices ticking higher above $70 a barrel as a powerful cyclone hit Oman and briefly disrupted exports from the Mideast energy producer. London Brent crude currently seen as the most reliable indicator of the global market, was up 32 cents at $70.77 a barrel. Gold benefited from the recent fall in the dollar, sending spot gold prices up to above $671 an ounce -- a rise of $20 from last week's near 11-week low
