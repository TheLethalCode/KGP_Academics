 Dhaka, June 4 (bdnews24.com)  Water activists Monday asked the developed world to stand by poor nations to help fight the shrinking access to safe water and drive out water-generated poverty. Prior to a summit of eight developed nations, popularly called G-8 summit, the activists made the demand to draw attention from the influential world leaders. Scores of nongovernmental organisations joined hands with Water and Sanitation Collaborative Council, Bangladesh Chapter to make the proposals at a discussion in the city's LGED auditorium. The chapter collected 500,000 signatures to popularise their campaign, and those signatures would be sent to G-8 Summit, the organisers said. The activists focused on the poor sanitation coverage in countries like Bangladesh, saying financial and technical assistance could help the resource-poor nations to fight water poverty. Some speakers, however, were cautious about any ill-motive that the developed nations could try to control the water resources of the poorer nations in the name of support. "Poorer nations need support from the developed nations but we should stay alert so that they can't rule our resources," said Hamidul Haq, chairman of Unnayan Sohojogy Team, an NGO. "We must bargain to keep our right intact before taking any assistance." The activists said the poor people are the worst victims of water poverty. In Bangladesh, scores of water-related problems are directly linked with poverty, the speakers said, adding that the country needs support to fight intrusion of saline water into the fresh water regime, arsenic contamination in ground water and mindless water pollution. Professor Mujibur Rahman of BUET, country director of Plan Bangladesh Thomas SP, Hasin Jahan from Water Aid-Bangladesh, World Bank water and sanitation specialist Safiul Azam Ahmed, chief of Dusthho Shasthyo Kendro Dibalok Sinha and chairman of Slum dwellers' Rights Protection Committee Abdul Mannan were present at the meeting. Fatema Begum of Slum Dwellers' Rights Protection Committee chaired the assembly while executive editor of the daily Sangbad Manjurul Ahsan Bulbul was moderator. bdnews24.
