 BEIJING, June 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Most illegal logging occurs in unstable regions or places with backward economies, a Chinese forestry official said on Tuesday, but defended wood products trade as a normal part of globalisation. State Forestry Administration spokesman Cao Qingyao said a Greenpeace report that China's timber industry was complicit in logging of protected merbau trees in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea was "not accurate." Merbau logs are smuggled to China, where they are processed and exported as floor boards and furnishings to the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe, Greenpeace said in April. "China's wood products and wood products trade has developed along with the globalisation of the world's economy, and is a result of the expansion of the international marketplace and specialisation," Cao told a press conference. "Blindly criticising is no way to resolve the problem (of illegal logging)," he said. "You have to adopt a developmental perspective and strike a balance between economic development and environmental protection." China has entered multilateral agreements to combat illegal logging and wood trade in Indonesia, Cao said. It has joined cooperations to develop the forestry industry in Myanmar and Russia. China's wood products industry has expanded rapidly as increasingly wealthy city residents buy wood flooring, large couches and dining tables for their newly purchased apartments. Chinese furniture exports are also growing as its labor advantage displaces traditional furniture centres elsewhere. The value of its furniture exports rose 17 percent in the first four months of this year, on top of a 27 percent rise in 2006. The volume of China's log imports rose 9.5 percent in 2006, but the value rose by 21 percent, implying that the country is importing more valuable wood. Cut timber imports rose 1.6 percent by volume, but 12 percent by value last year. China's cut timber exports rose 31 percent by volume in 2006. China has tried to crack down on illegal logging at home, after water rushing down the steep, deforested slopes of Tibet and Sichuan contributed to floods along the Yangtze in 1998. But once-richly forested hills in Yunnan have been stripped bare and left arid by rampant logging that began in the mid-1990s, while tiny farmed plots have replaced forests in Guizhou. "It is true that there has been illegal logging in Yunnan, and non-scientific logging has spread over large areas over recent years," Cao said. "Logging hills bald is not in line with modern forestry practice and a stop has been ordered to the practice. There have been some individual cases of damage to virgin forest." Cao listed seven areas being monitored for illegal logging in China
