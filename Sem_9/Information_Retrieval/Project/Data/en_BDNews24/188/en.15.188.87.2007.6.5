 Smita Mishra bdnews24.com Correspondent Guwahati, June 5 (bdnews24.com) -- The chief of Indian Border Security Force Tuesday said his troops had nabbed two Bangladesh politicians from the state of Tripura last month. AK Mitra, director general of BSF, told a news conference in Agartala that his soldiers had picked up Juba League chairman Jahangir Kabir Nanak and general secretary Mirza Azam from Kalsimura village on May 28. "Our troops then handed them over to the police because they had no valid travel documents," Mitra said. This is the first official admission of the arrests by an Indian official. But Tripura police chief KTD Singh declined to provide details or even confirm the arrest of the two leaders. "Many Bangladesh nationals are arrested in Tripura and we interrogate them. If we find they have come illegally, we push them back," Singh said. Bangladesh officials in Dhaka had earlier said Nanak and Azam had been arrested in India, citing reports from their diplomats based in Agartala, Tripura's capital. They said the two had fled the crackdown by the country's interim government against politicians with corruption links. BSF sources say the two were nabbed from the house of an Indian national who had provided shelter. Hours after the report was posted on the bdnews24.com site, a man claiming to be Mirza Azam, said he had not been arrested. He used a Grameenphone number to say: "I'm in Dhaka." Reports suggest that former lawmaker Haji Selim is living in Melaghar in west Tripura while BNP leader Harris Chowdhury in living with relatives in Karimganj in Assam. bdn
