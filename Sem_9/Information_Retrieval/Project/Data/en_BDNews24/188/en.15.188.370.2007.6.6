<TITLE> Taiwan ex-premier eyes settling China dispute </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TAIPEI, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A former Taiwan premier and ex-defence minister who went back to school in his 70s said on Wednesday he would collect the views of 100 scholars to seek a solution to the stubborn China-Taiwan impasse within a year. Tang Fei told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday that over the next month he would form a private association -- the Taiwan Future Prospects Society -- and gather the academics to settle the island's thorniest political issue. The scholars, ideally from Taiwan and abroad but not China, will in a year recommend a populist, politically centrist way to co-exist with China, Tang said. China has claimed Taiwan as part of its territory since their split after civil war in 1949. Beijing has vowed to use force if the self-ruled democratic island formally declares independence and, and it is unlikely to accept any solution that defines Taiwan as anything but a part of China. Taiwan is politically polarised. The ruling party has repeatedly riled China by asserting the island's sovereignty, while the opposition seeks closer China ties. Today's tense status quo, or self rule without formal independence, cannot last forever, Tang said. "Taiwan has fallen into a mud pit and cannot get out," Tang said. "I know this is very difficult, so I want to ask some scholars to come and express ideas." Although Tang, premier for five months in 2000 and a defence minister under the previous administration, holds no public office now, his name still carries weight with the public. He has studied on fellowships at Harvard and Stanford universities since 2000. Voters go to the polls less and less often because Taiwan's political extremes have made little headway even as the economy sags and Taiwan firms move factories to China, he said. "Both parties are putting Taiwan's development in second place," Tang said, referring to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the opposition Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang. About 70 academics have personally inquired about joining the association, and Tang's home phone has been ringing so often with other inquiries that his wife sometimes cannot use it. Accepting too many scholars would over-complicate the task, Tang fears. No one in the government, the military or the dominant political parties need apply, he said. Tang will open a modest office in Taipei and begin the search for solutions with small meetings of six to eight people. But he has no specific proposals to lay on the table, at least for now. "I don't know that much, so this association will be an education for me," he said
