 LONDON, June 06 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The sons of Princess Diana pleaded in vain on Tuesday with a British television channel not to broadcast graphic photos in a documentary about their mother's death in a Paris car crash 10 years ago. Channel 4 said it had weighed the princes' concerns against the legitimate public interest of the documentary and will be broadcasting the images in 'Diana: The Witnesses in the Tunnel' on Wednesday.

Diana died along with her companion Dodi al Fayed when the car driven by their chauffeur Henri Paul crashed in a Paris road tunnel while being chased by paparazzi on motorbikes. Paul was also killed. The decision to make the letter public underlined the anger of the young princes who have constantly asked for their mother to be left to 'rest in peace'. But their pleas are falling on deaf ears in the lead up to the 10th anniversary of her death in August. Last year, the princes criticized an Italian magazine for printing a picture from the crash. "We feel deeply saddened that such a low has been reached," the two princes said in a rare statement. Milan-based magazine Chi defended its decision to run the photo, which showed Diana slumped and dying in the mangled Mercedes moments after it slammed into the tunnel at high spe
