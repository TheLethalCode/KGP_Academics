 LONDON, June 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British outdoor clothing and camping gear retailer Blacks Leisure Group said on Monday that Chief Executive Russell Hardy has stepped down by mutual consent as the company looks to restructure. Finance Director Keith Fleming, who becomes acting CEO, is seen as a strong candidate for the permanent position by Blacks' board, according to a source familiar with the situation. Broker KBC Peel Hunt earlier upgraded Blacks to hold from sell, saying a recognised external appointment is the only way to rebuild credibility. Blacks also said it is reviewing options for its 49 Freespirit stores, which sell surf, skateboarding and snowboarding gear, and Freespirit's branded clothing range. It would be willing to sell the brand for 40 million pounds ($79.1 million), the Mail on Sunday newspaper reported, without naming sources. Blacks was not immediately available for comment on Monday but the source familiar with the situation said a sale was not a foregone conclusion. Shares in Blacks rose 1.9 percent to 254-3/4p by 0856 GMT, valuing it around 108.4 million pounds. Blacks, which has shops under the names Millets, Blacks, Freespirit and O'Neill, traded poorly last year and is closing 45 loss-making stores, mostly under the Millets label. The firm will have around 250 Millets stores after the closures, around 100 Blacks stores, 49 Freespririt stores and around 15 O'Neill stores. Blacks board said in a statement on Monday it would consider external candidates as appropriate but Fleming, 46, would become acting CEO. He has been finance director since July 2006. Hardy had been chief executive since January 2005. Blacks, which made a 13.8 million pounds loss in the year to March, because of a 13.9 million provision for the closure of the Millets stores, said on Monday that current trading is in line with expectations but that a lot depends on the summer weather and the success of new camping and clothing lines. The company has previously blamed good weather for poor trading because it sells more warm and waterproof camping gear when the weather is bad. It is trying to adjust to increasingly hot summers by focusing on lines such as picnic equipment. Blacks previously said it hoped for a significantly better performance in the year to March 2008 than the year before when it made a small trading profit before the provision for store closures
