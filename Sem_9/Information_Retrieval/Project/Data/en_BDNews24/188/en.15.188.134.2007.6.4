 PANAMA CITY, June 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Democracy in Latin America is at risk from a lack of control over political party and election campaign financing that can give rich donors too big a say in countries' running, a report said on Sunday. Berlin-based Transparency International said in a joint report with the Carter Center that there were deep flaws in standards and practices regarding political financing in eight countries it studied and that donors were seldom identified. Former US President Jimmy Carter urged governments to ensure that not only rich politicians were successful and that donors did not wield excessive influence over candidates they had helped bring to power. "Political financing regulation is essential to a healthy democracy," he said in a statement. The study focused on Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay and Peru. The report released in Panama City said money was vital for democracies and parties to run smoothly but that the source of funds had to be transparent and subject to oversight. "Citizens have no way of knowing who finances candidates and political representatives," said Silke Pfeiffer, director of Transparency International's Americas department. "The lack of transparency in political financing poses alarming risks of corruption since private donations easily become a channel for buying favours," said Pfeiffer
