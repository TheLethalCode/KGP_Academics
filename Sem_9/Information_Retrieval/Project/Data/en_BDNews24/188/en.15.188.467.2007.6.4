 BERLIN, June 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A summit of rich nations this week could pave the way for a world deal on global warming even if Washington opposes German calls for an agreement to slash emissions now, the UN's top climate official said on Monday. Yvo de Boer said the June 6-8 meeting of the Group of Eight in the German town of Heiligendamm could lay down principles for starting formal negotiations on a long-term climate pact beyond 2012 at a UN meeting in Bali, Indonesia, in December. "Something relatively banal like 'let's go to Bali and do our job' would be pretty good from my point of view," he said. "It's difficult to see how it's going to be possible to agree at this G8 on a maximum temperature increase or an emissions reduction percentage by the middle of the century," he told Reuters. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who favours a 50 percent cut in emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050, has acknowledged she will probably fail to overcome U.S. objections to her call for a deal to limit warming to a rise of 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit). But de Boer, head of the UN Climate Change Secretariat in Bonn, said the G8 could still salvage some impetus for a world deal to succeed the Kyoto Protocol beyond 2012. "I still think that this G8 can fulfil a very important role," he said, if leaders could agree on a need to launch negotiations in Bali for sharp emission cuts, based on the latest scientific findings about warming. Bush, who left for Europe on Monday, unveiled his first plan for fighting global warming beyond 2012 last week, saying he wanted the top 15 emitters to agree on cuts by the end of 2008. At a meeting of top officials from her Christian Democrat (CDU) party on Monday, Merkel said Bush's proposal represented "progress" because it recognised the importance of global action to combat climate change. According to officials who attended the meeting, she said the challenge was to discuss at Heiligendamm how to integrate Bush's plans under the umbrella of the United Nations. US Ambassador to Germany William Timken, speaking on German television on Monday morning, said Bush's plan addressed the heart of the problem more than the UN track. "It is much more important to get specific agreements between these (15) countries than with the rest of the United Nations," he said, noting however that a wide deal should be the ultimate goal. De Boer said White House officials had told him that the U.S. talks were "supposed to be complementary" rather than a rival track to the United Nations. But he said that "maybe the G8 communique should state that is the intention." Kyoto is meant as a first step to fend off projections of ever more heatwaves, floods and rising seas linked to rising emissions of greenhouse gases, mainly from burning fossil fuels. Bush in 2001 rejected Kyoto, which obliges 35 rich nations to cut emissions of greenhouse gases by 5 percent below 1990 levels by 2008-12. He said it would cost too much and wrongly omitted developing countries. China, the world's number two emitter of greenhouse gases behind the United States, issued a national climate change plan on Monday that stresses it will not sacrifice economic growth to international demands to curb greenhouse gas emissions. The plan vows to combat global warming through energy saving, agricultural adaptation and forest planting. "This is more of a mobilisation rally to draw the battle lines as the G8 approaches," said Wenran Jiang, an energy expert at the University of Auckland. De Boer praised the Chinese plans as "very comprehensive and ambitious." The United Nations wants developing countries to brake the rise of emissions beyond 2012 but says rich nations, who have burnt most fossil fuels, should make deep cuts. Achim Steiner, head of the UN Environment Programme, praised Merkel's efforts. "She pushed the international community further than it would have gone if Germany chose not to make climate change the main issue," he sa
