 LOS ANGELES, June 04 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End' overwhelmed the international box office for the second consecutive weekend, making off with an estimated $105.4 million from 103 markets. Its foreign total stands at $408.8 million. Worldwide, including North America, 'At World's End' has grossed $625.3 million to date. 'At World's End' is the 24th film in industry history to have grossed more than $400 million overseas, and the fifth Disney title to pass that milestone. The latest in the 'Pirates' film already has grossed 16% more than the final international total ($350 million) of 2003's 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' and 60% of the final overseas gross ($642 million) accumulated by last year's 'Dead Man's Chest.' The weekend's only new market was India, where 'At World's End' made off with an estimated $1.4 million, 50% more than the combined opening gross in the market of the first two 'Pirates' titles. It was the market's third-biggest opening ever, Disney said. 'At World's End' was No. 1 with mighty market share everywhere. In Japan, it earned $11.5 million (off just 4%), for a market total of $35.5 million. In the UK, the weekend tally also was $11.5 million (down 49%), for a total of $57 million. Meanwhile, 'Spider-Man 3' registered a weekend estimate of $11.8 million from 77 territories, lifting its overseas total to $525.7 million. Sony said it now ranks as the 12th-biggest overseas box office hit in industry history, one notch behind last year's 'The Da Vinci Code,' which grossed $539.7 million. Worldwide, 'Spider-Man 3' has earned $844 million in five weeks. 'Zodiac' performed well despite the tentpole onslaught, grossing $5.8 million from 38 territories. The crime drama's overseas total stands at $26.4 million. 'Shrek the Third' added four markets -- India, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand -- to an as-yet-limited foreign rollout, garnering an estimated $4 million from nine territories. Its overseas total rose to $27.6 million. It will bow in 36 territories by June 30. Other foreign totals: '28 Weeks Later,' $16.7 million; 'Shooter,' $44.3 million; 'Mr Bean's Holiday,' $181.2 million; 'Hot Fuzz,' $50.1 million; and '300,' $232.2 milli
