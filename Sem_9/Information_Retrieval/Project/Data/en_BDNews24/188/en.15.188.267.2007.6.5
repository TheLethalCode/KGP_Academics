<TITLE> Henin too classy for Williams and Serbs roll on </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PARIS, June 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The outcome was the same though it was the imperious tennis of Justine Henin everybody was talking about this time when the Belgian top seed outclassed Serena Williams at Roland Garros on Tuesday. Henin's 6-4 6-3 quarter-final victory means she has now won 31 consecutive sets at the claycourt slam. More importantly she is two wins away from equalling the hat-trick of titles achieved by Monica Seles in 1992. Williams, the 2002 champion here, knew she was well beaten by a better claycourt player and warmly congratulated Henin at the end, a far cry from the bad-tempered 2003 semi-final when she was booed off court and later called Henin a liar. Joining Henin in Thursday's semi-finals is Maria Sharapova, who reached the last four for the first time by brushing aside fellow 20-year-old Russian Anna Chavetadze 6-3 6-4. Jelena Jankovic and Anna Ivanovic also won, giving Serbia two women in the semi-finals of a grand slam for the first time. Fourth seed Jankovic, the hottest player on tour coming into Roland Garros, beat 18-year-old Czech Nicole Vaidisova 6-3 7-5 while Ivanovic, also born in Belgrade, beat 2006 runner-up Svetlana Kuznetsova 6-0 3-6 6-1 in a topsy turvy encounter. "Wherever you go you just see Serbians all over the place, winning all these matches it's incredible," said the 22-year-old Jankovic, who will now face Henin in her first semi-final at Roland Garros. Novak Djokovic has the chance to join them on Wednesday in the men's event. SMILING TEENAGER The 19-year-old Ivanovic could not stop smiling after reaching her first grand-slam semi-final by beating Kuznetsova. She romped to the first set in 21 minutes and dominated again in the third set after her Russian opponent, hampered by an abdominal injury, briefly came to her senses. "It's very exciting for us and I'm sure people back home are very proud of us," said Ivanovic after going one step further than she managed here in 2005. She plays Sharapova next. Despite winning in straight sets, Jankovic was given a much sterner examination by Vaidisova, the youngest player in the last eight and a semi-finalist last year. The match came to the boil when Vaidisova broke to level the second set at 5-5, saving a match point in the process, but she immediately lost her own serve. Vaidisova saved three more match points, two with flashing winners, before Jankovic won it at the fifth attempt.
