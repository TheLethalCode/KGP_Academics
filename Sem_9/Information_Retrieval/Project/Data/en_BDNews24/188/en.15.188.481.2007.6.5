 PORT OF SPAIN, June 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two suspects in a foiled plot to blow up New York's John F Kennedy International Airport appeared in court in Trinidad and Tobago on Monday and were accused of conspiring to commit terrorism. Abdul Kadir, a citizen of Guyana and former member of its parliament, and Kareem Ibrahim, a citizen of Trinidad and Tobago, are among four suspects in the case, which has raised the possibility of Islamic radicalism taking root in the Caribbean. They were led into a packed Port of Spain court in handcuffs at about 9:30 a.m. EDT/1330 GMT for a brief initial appearance before Chief Magistrate Sherman McNichols. "They have been accused of an offense to commit a terrorist act under the laws of the United States," David West, an attorney representing the US government, told the judge. Kadir and Ibrahim, who were bearded and clad in loose-fitting traditional Muslim clothing like many of the courtroom spectators, looked calm and kept mostly silent during the 20-minute hearing. McNichols told them they faced possible extradition to the United States. McNichols set a hearing on formal extradition proceedings for August 2. There was no request for bail at Monday's hearing and Rajiv Persad, a defense lawyer, said he needed more time to prepare the case. A third suspect, Russell Defreitas, a US citizen and native of Guyana, was arrested in New York. US authorities said he was a former airport employee who conducted surveillance for the group, using his knowledge of the site to identify targets and escape routes. US authorities have said Kadir and a fourth suspect, Abdel Nur of Guyana, believed to be at large in Trinidad, belonged to Jamaat al Muslimeen, a Muslim group behind a 1990 coup attempt in Trinidad. US officials said they did not believe the men were linked to al Qaeda. Jamaat al Muslimeen has not commented on the suspects' alleged plot to blow up the airport's jet fuel tanks and part of the 40-mile (64-km) pipeline feeding them. Nur is the uncle of Andrew "Sixhead" Lewis, Guyana's first professional boxing champion. "I never knew him as a person who would be a terrorist," Lewis, who won the WBA welterweight title in 2001, told the Guyana daily Kaieteur News. Trinidadian Police Commissioner Trevor Paul, who said local authorities were working closely with the FBI, declined to comment on Jamaat al Muslimeen at a news conference. He appealed for all citizens to be on the lookout for Nur, whose photograph, showing a thin black man with a gray-black beard, was issued to the news media. "Mr Nur is wanted for an alleged terrorist act and we consider him to be armed and dangerous," Paul said. He said authorities had established that Nur, whose given name was Compton Ezersley, arrived in Trinidad on May 20. This twin-island southern Caribbean nation of 1.3 million people is almost equally divided between descendants of African slaves and Indian labourers sent to the Caribbean by the British in the 19th century. Muslims comprise 6 percent to 8 percent of the population and most are descended from the Indian labourers, but the small Jamaat sect is mostly made up of Islamists of African descent. In his brief remarks in court, Ibrahim acknowledged under questioning from McNichols that he was Winston Kingston before he took his Muslim name. He said he was also known as Amir Karim
