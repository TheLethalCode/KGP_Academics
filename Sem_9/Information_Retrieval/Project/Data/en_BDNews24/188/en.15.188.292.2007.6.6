<TITLE> UK shares dip along with Europe before ECB verdict </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's top share index dipped on Wednesday in sympathy with European stocks before a widely expected rate hike by the European Central Bank while also taking their cue from Asian and US equity weakness. At 0820 GMT, the FTSE 100 was down 0.47 percent, weighed by Vodafone, National Grid, Daily Mail, Entreprise Inns and Punch Taverns which are all going ex-dividend this session. But pharmaceuticals helped to arrest losses as GlaxoSmithKline, whose stocks have been battered recently after researchers said its diabetes drug Avandia raised the risk of heart attacks and death, rose 2.1 percent after a new study on the medicine shed little light on heart risk. But several experts said the evidence still suggests the popular diabetes drug raises the risk of heart attack. AstraZeneca said Chief Financial Officer Jon Symonds would leave the company and its stock was up 0.8 percent. On the monetary policy front, the ECB is widely expected to raise rates to 4.0 percent this session -- the prospect of which has kept benchmark 10-year bond yields around 4-1/2 year highs. The Bank of England also decides on interest rates on Thursday and is seen keeping them steady at 5.5 percent, even though a hike to 5.75 percent is widely expected this year. "It's true that interest rate decisions are very much on agenda," said Peter Dixon, UK economist at Commerzbank. He added: "We had a pretty weak end to the US session yesterday, we had a not particularly brilliant overnight in Asia. To some degree (we are) getting the hangover (from that) today." Asian and US stocks both eased overnight after the Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke warned inflation is still a major concern, all but dashing remaining hopes for an interest rate cut in the US this year. Man Group was among top performers, up 0.9 percent, after the world's largest listed hedge fund group reported a 3.44 percent rise in net asset value of its flagship AHL fund, traders said. "It is up on good figures from AHL last night, which is their US hedge fund. They were up 3.4 percent, slightly ahead of expectations. Obviously, Man shares came under pressure late yesterday with the sell-off. They are gaining back a little bit," a trader said. Royal Bank of Scotland was up 0.6 percent after JP Morgan said it remained its top pick in the UK banking sector. But in the same note, JP Morgan cut Northern Rock to underweight taking the mortgage lender down 2 percent. Among other gainers, Woolworths Group rose 0.9 percent after the British sweets-to-DVDs retailer Woolworths Plc reported a deterioration in underlying sales at its high-street shops but said profit margins had improved as it managed stock more effectively. In other news British telecoms group Cable & Wireless said Chairman Richard Lapthorne could be awarded a bonus currently worth as much as 11 million pounds if he hits performance targets over three years. The stock was down 0.3 percent
