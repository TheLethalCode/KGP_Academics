 Dhaka, June 3 (bdnews24.com)-- Joint forces Sunday arrested Abul Khayer Litu, chairman of Bengal Group, at his Gulshan office. An official with Bengal Group told bdnews24.com that he was arrested shortly before 4pm. There was no official confirmation of his arrest. Litu's home staffer Afzal Hossain told bdnews24.com: "I'm not sure about the arrest. But I couldn't get in touch with him after 4pm." Afzal said Litu had lunch at home. "I saw him on the phone after lunch," he said. No officials were found at the Bengal Group headquarters in Gulshan-2 Sunday evening. Mohammad Israfil, a watchman for the building, said: "I have been here on duty from 6pm. I don't know anything about the arrest."
