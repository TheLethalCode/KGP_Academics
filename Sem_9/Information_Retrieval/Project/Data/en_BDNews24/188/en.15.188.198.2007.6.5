 NEW YORK, June 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - When it comes to optimism and a belief that hard work pays off, people in Los Angeles are more optimistic than other US residents that they will achieve the American Dream, according to a new survey. Eighty percent of people in the southern California city believe that success will follow if they are ambitious and work hard. "This is an incredibly optimistic population, which is a pretty big asset for a community," said Professor Mara Marks of Loyola Marymount University, Los Angeles, in an interview. The survey polled 1,700 English, Spanish and Korean-speaking residents as a follow-up to a survey done after the 1992 riots in the city. It was conducted by the university and the Thomas and Dorothy Leavey Center for the Study of Los Angeles. The American dream is considered a counterweight to destabilizing economic and social forces, such as economic recession or large scale immigration. A 2005 New York Times poll showed that only 72 percent of Americans believed they had achieved the American Dream or would ever do so. "To have this pool of optimistic people who actually believe that if you work hard and you play by the rules, you have a good opportunity ... this is an incredible force for social stability, at a time when there are so many changes going on in society and the world," Marks told Reuters. The 2007 survey examined race, ethnicity and citizenship and found that white residents were more likely than Koreans, Latinos or African Americans to achieve the American dream. Eighty-two percent of home owners believed they had achieved this dream, against only 44 percent of renters. But the survey also showed that more than two-thirds of non-US citizens are optimistic that they will achieve that dream within their lifetime, even though US citizens were more likely to indicate they had already achieved it. "Immigrants, and especially non-naturalized immigrants, turned out to have the strongest optimism about their ability to achieve the American dream of any group that we surveyed," said Marks. "But when economists and a variety of other experts look at the avenues for social mobility, there are a lot of reasons why it's getting harder and harder for the ideal to live up to the reality," she said. She cited a widening gap between the rich and poor, and a decline in social programs such as health care, home and student loans and insurance as challenges for younger generations that older generations didn't have. But Marks says that the collective optimism is a force for social change that is valuable to the community and the country. "To have a large stock of people who are willing to take risks and open up businesses, and invest in property, and do all the things that we want good American citizens to do -- that is an incredible engine for economic growth, for community stability, and for all kinds of things
