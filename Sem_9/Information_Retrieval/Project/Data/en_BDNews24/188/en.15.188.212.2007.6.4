<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 3 (bdnews24.com) -- Founder of the Centre for Rehabilitation of the Paralysed Valerie A Taylor, two trustee board members and a citizens' committee want dissolution of the CRP trustee board. They brought charges of lack of mutual trust against the members of the board. At a press conference at Dhaka Reporters Unity, they sought intervention of the caretaker government to end the stalemate in the CRP. Taylor, trustee board member Mohammad Mustaq Ahmed, and Nagorik Committee members SM Anwar Hossain, Ramendu Majumder, Professor Kabir Chowdhury and Akku Chowdhury were present at the press conference. SM Anwar Hossain in his written speech said the present trustee board of the CRP lacks "mutual trust". He said resignations of all members are the only way to restore glory to the CRP. Hossain said Taylor should be returned to her earlier post with all powers to run the organisation. Valerie said CRP inspires hope in the minds of handicapped people. Valerie who established CRP in 1979 was relieved of the post of coordinator on May 14. "When a man sees the light of hope he can go forward. The door of CRP must be kept open to them always," she said. Professor Kabir Chowdhury said patients are now paying high charges for services at CRP. Engineer Anil Bhowmick, who was present at the conference, said he received services at CRP in 1984-85. "But the quality of services has gone down over the last two years, compared with 1984-85." CRP trustee board member Mohammad Mustaq Ahmed said the current mismanagement and lack of coordination of the trustee board began two years ago. "Sufferings of patients at the centre were enormous because of divided opinions of the members," he said. Meanwhile, CRP's acting chairman Nurul Haque told bdnews24.com: "I didn't take the decision consulting with all. It's true in some sense." "I tried to contact them but they were not available, which is why they are now raising allegations." On whether he would resign, Haque said: "I don't care who is telling what. I have a lot of contributions to the organisation. I have been working here without pay from 1992." Tangail District Handicapped People's Development Council president Shamsur Rahman Moti told bdnews24.com: "If the trustee board members don't resign, we will fast unto death at Savar National Mausoleum." bdnews24.com
