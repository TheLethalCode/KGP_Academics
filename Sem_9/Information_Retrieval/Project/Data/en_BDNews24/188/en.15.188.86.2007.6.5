 Dhaka, June 4 (bdnews24.com) - Loan defaulters, tax evaders and persons convicted of crimes and corruption will not qualify to contest FBCCI polls within five years of conviction, a government order said Monday. In a letter, the commerce ministry asked the apex trade body to change the rules relating to participation in its election in 15 days in line with the Trade Organisation Ordinance, 1961. If the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry fails to do so by the deadline, the ministry will take its own course through a gazette notification. The federation's election commission has set August 16 for the biennial polls. Business leaders welcomed the move. Former BGMEA president Annisul Huq said: "When one can't contest national polls for this kind of bad reputation, such rules should be in force for businesses too. "It'll bring in a positive impact," he told bdnews24.com. Of the 38 executive committee members of the apex trade bodyin line with the FBCCI constitution12 will be elected from district level chambers and 12 from trade associations while seven will be nominated from the MCCI and six divisional chambers and seven from leading trade associations. The FBCCI president will be elected from the association group this year. Recently, various quarters have asked the authorities not to allow loan defaulters to contest the FBCCI polls, saying their presence in the executive body will not only discourage honest businessmen but also encourage others to default on loans. bdnews
