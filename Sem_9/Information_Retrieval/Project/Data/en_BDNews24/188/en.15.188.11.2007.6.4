 RAMALLAH, West Bank, June 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Israeli general on Monday ordered two jailed Hamas cabinet ministers and a legislator from the Islamist group held without trial for six months, one of their lawyers said.

Israeli Defence Minister Amir Peretz has said the detentions could put pressure on Hamas to stop rocket attacks from Gaza. Palestinian lawyer Osama al-Saadi said Major-General Gadi Shamni, head of the Israeli military's central command, signed an order to place Kabha, Shaer and Zeidan in what Israel calls administrative detention until Dec. 4. The Israeli military, Justice Ministry and Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's office had no immediate comment. Israel's use of administrative detention against Palestinians, effectively jailing them without trial on security grounds, has been condemned by human rights groups. "The arrests of ministers and lawmakers are political arrests," Saadi said. He said Israeli authorities lacked evidence to win any court case against the men and had chosen instead "to return to the old way of sending people into administrative detention". The arrests of elected Palestinian officials have raised international concern and the detentions last month led the U.S. State Department to express misgivings about the Israeli action. Over the past year, Israel has detained about 40 elected Hamas officials.
