 SHANGHAI, June 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China's main stock index tumbled 8.3 percent on Monday in its second biggest drop this decade, extending big losses suffered last week after the government hiked the share trading tax to cool a bull run. The index has now lost 15.3 percent from last Tuesday's record intra-day high, erasing about $340 billion of value. A fall of 10 percent is an internationally accepted definition of a bear market in stocks. After taking losses of around 20 percent or more on their holdings of volatile small-capital stocks late last week, panicking individual investors dumped stocks on Monday. Many fund managers and analysts said the index, which had risen 62 percent this year to last Tuesday's close after surging 130 percent gain in 2006, had room to fall much further in coming days as the excesses of the bull run were corrected. But many also said they did not believe the market as a whole was going into freefall. "This is obviously panic selling, and the sentiment is quickly spreading across the market," said Wang Jing, deputy general manager at Everbright Securities. "But the fall is normal today, given the fact that the market has gone up so much. It won't be surprising if the index falls to about 3,000 points -- which would mean a 30 percent correction from the top." He added: "Third-tier stocks pushed up by speculative buying will likely fall further. But stocks with solid earnings growth potential should be able to withstand the sell-off." The Shanghai Composite Index ended the day at 3,670.401 points, its lowest level since April 25. Losing stocks overwhelmed gainers by 846 to 17, with about 466 shares plunging their 10 percent daily limits. Turnover in Shanghai A shares was active at 143.0 billion yuan ($18.7 billion), but down sharply from Friday's 224.7 billion yuan, suggesting many investors were pulling out of the market. In an apparent attempt by authorities to restore confidence, front-page editorials in official newspapers on Monday assured investors the market's medium- and long-term outlook was still positive, and that the tax hike was merely aimed at speculators. But this failed to halt the selling, as it was little comfort to millions of individual investors who had entered the market in recent months to make money from short-term trading. "Most new retail investors are too speculative to envision the "mid- to long-term positive market trend". Their exit will cause a market landing, be it hard or soft," Morgan Stanley said in a report. Most worrying to analysts were deep falls in some of the blue chips favored by institutional investors, since those stocks had stayed firm last week even as speculative shares tumbled. Oil refiner Sinopec, which had risen 16 percent over the final three days of the week, sank its 10 percent daily limit to 13.65 yuan. Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, the country's biggest bank, dropped 8.1 percent to 4.99 yuan. Nevertheless, many analysts and fund managers said they did not believe the government, which has made a strong stock market central to its economic reforms, would permit an extended slide. Traders see strong technical support for the index around 3,600, where it briefly peaked in mid-April. That level would still leave the market up 35 percent from the start of this year. "Since the index has even fallen below 3,700 now, I believe the correction is about over," said Zheng Weigang at Shanghai Securities. ($1 = 7.65 yuan
