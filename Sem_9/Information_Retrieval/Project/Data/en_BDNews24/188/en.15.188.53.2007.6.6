 LORREZ-LE-BOCAGE, France, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two hundred years after Napoleon led France on Europe's battlefields, his great-great-grand nephew is fighting his own, more modest battle for a seat in the French national assembly. Standing almost two metres high with a full head of grey hair, Charles Napoleon strikes a stark contrast to the history book image of the much smaller emperor Napoleon Bonaparte who ruled France in the early 19th century. "Some people tell me: 'Napoleon is dead. So who are you?'" the 57-year old said, greeting voters on a small market in a picturesque village south of Paris, where the centrist hopes to win legislative elections on June 10 and 17. Charles Napoleon runs a foundation and has written several books about his famous ancestor. But the politician hopes voters associate more with him than just his family roots. "I stand behind my name, but I'm also careful never to hide my own values," Napoleon said, close to an orange-painted "Napomobil" van, with which he travels through his constituency. "One lesson I draw from Napoleon and other leaders ... is that you need to be able to take risks and innovate," he said. "We're always facing new problems, such as the environmental challenges today. We must respond in new ways ... In a similar way, the question of equality of human beings was posed after the French revolution. ... He (Napoleon) responded to that. It is up to us to tackle our era's problems," he said. Napoleon is running for the Democratic Movement party, which centrist Francois Bayrou founded after his defeat in France's presidential election last month. Bayrou had promised to bridge traditional party gaps in order to conduct wideranging reforms. "We need to go beyond the left-right divide," Napoleon said, adding he agreed with some of the measures promised by newly elected conservative President Nicolas Sarkozy. "But some of his policies risk worsening social gaps," he said. Sarkozy hopes to win a large majority for his Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) party in this month's elections to push through various reforms on education, the labour market and law and order in parliament. Surveys see his UMP comfortably ahead. Napoleon's area has traditionally been held by the right. But the centrist said he was ready for battle, joking he that had the advantage that voters at least remembered his name. His rival from the Greens party, Liliane Pays, said she was not afraid of her challenger, saying: "I'm used to big names." "The French are very proud of Napoleon," said voter Philippe Augier, 57, referring to the ruler, who his compatriots remember as much for his military achievements as for his Napoleonic Code, which laid modern France's bureaucratic foundations. "But I don't think that's gonna help anyone win an election today," Augier add
