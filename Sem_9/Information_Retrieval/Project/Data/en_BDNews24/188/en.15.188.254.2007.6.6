 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Mumbai, June 6 (bdnews24.com)  Software giant SAP has trained its sights on Bangladesh, said the company's Indian subcontinent markets' president and CEO Alan Sedghi in a press conference Wednesday. "We believe in localised solutions and will continue to support local talent at SAP," he told regional media at the SAP Summit 2007 in Mumbai, revealing that 40,000 Indians are now among the 300,000 SAP consultants worldwide. Sedghi said such a pool of experts could also be created in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka as small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have been driving this region's economic engine. SAP is a leading provider of business software solutions that offer "enterprise resource planning" or ERPindustry jargon meaning total management of a business. It is Europe's largest and the world's third largest software company. According to India's Economic Times 36 out of the top 50 companies in India are SAP clients. Last year's biannual ET 500 index showed nine out of ten top Indian businesses run SAP solutions, while the German software major recently became the first enterprise solution vendor to cross the 1000 client mark in India. Sedghi said multibillion-dollar corporations as well as small businesses in the region can equally benefit from ERP and other solutions for continued growth and efficiency. He said SAP also dominates 24 percent of the Indian market in customer relationship management (CRM). This announcement coincided with the UK's leading independent study firm, Forrester Research, declaring SAP as a global leader in enterprise CRM. Sedghi claimed ERP and CRM are crucial operating tools for small and medium business entities as every SME wants to expand. He said SAP has customised solutions with localised expertise to serve such growth-hungry South Asia enterprises. "Almost 400 Indian enterprises have chosen us their preferred software solution vendor, translating to the addition of more than two new customers per work day in 2007," SAP's South Asian head said. Companies in the financial, pharmaceutical, retail, engineering, education, and IT sectors among others are thriving with SAP in India, he said. bdnews2
