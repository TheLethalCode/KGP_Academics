<TITLE> Japan PM says no plan to extend parliament session </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BERLIN, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Wednesday he was not planning to extend Japan's parliament session, although there were a number of bills the government still wanted to pass. Asked about a possible extension to the session due to end on June 23, he told reporters in Berlin: "I am not thinking of it all at the moment. There is an upper house election planned, so I want to aim to pass the bills within the session. We still have some time left." Recent opinion polls show Abe struggling ahead of the July upper house elections, his first big ballot-box test since taking office last September. Abe has been hurt by a public outcry in recent weeks over the failure of a government agency to keep track of millions of premium payments, raising the prospect of retirees being short-changed. The prime minister's popularity has also taken a beating since a cabinet minister committed suicide last week before he was due to face questions in parliament over links to political funding scandals. A loss for the LDP and its coalition partner in the July poll would not automatically require the prime minister to step down, but it could increase calls within the party for him to do so. A defeat would also risk blocking key legislation and delay economic reforms. Abe is in Germany for meetings with European Union leaders and to attend the G8 summit starting on Thursday in the Baltic coastal resport of Heiligendamm
