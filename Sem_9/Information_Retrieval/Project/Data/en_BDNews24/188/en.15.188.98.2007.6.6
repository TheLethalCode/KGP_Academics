 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court placed Awami League joint general secretary Obaidul Quader on a three-day remand Wednesday. Metropolitan court magistrate Mamun Al Rashid made the order after Ramna police chief Daulat M Akbar sought a seven-day remand. Quader was taken to the court at 12:15pm when Akbar told the court that the former state minister had a strong role behind tumultuous political course that undermined public security through January. The official accused him of delivering seditious statements that fuelled chaos. As a state minister in 1996-2001, he was also involved in corruption, according to the case documents.
