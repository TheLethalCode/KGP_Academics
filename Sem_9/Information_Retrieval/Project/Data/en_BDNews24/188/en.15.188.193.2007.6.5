<TITLE> US discontent over Iraq, Democrats rising: poll </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, June 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Americans are becoming more discontented over the situation in Iraq and more unhappy with Democrats who won control of Congress last November largely because voters want to see an end to the war, according to a Washington Post/ABC News poll. Just 39 percent said they approve of the job Congress is doing, down from 44 percent in April. Approval of congressional Democrats dropped to 44 percent from 54 percent, according to the poll results. Much of that drop was fueled by lower approval ratings of congressional Democrats among strong opponents of the Iraq war, independents and liberal Democrats, The Washington Post reported on Tuesday. In April, Americans, by a 25-point margin, trusted the Democrats over US President George W Bush to handle the situation in Iraq. In the new poll, Democrats held their advantage but only by 16 points, the Post reported Bush's job-approval rating stands at 35 percent, unchanged from April. Deep public skepticism about Iraq, concerns about the Democrats and Bush, and near-record-high gasoline prices appear to have combined to sour the overall mood in the country, the Post said. Seventy-three percent of Americans said the country is pretty seriously on the wrong track, the newspaper said. Overall, 61 percent said the war in Iraq was not worth fighting, and nearly two-thirds said the United States is not making significant progress restoring civil order in Iraq, the Post said. Fifty-five percent, a new high, said the number of US military forces in Iraq should be decreased, but only 15 percent called for an immediate withdrawal, the report said newspaper. The telephone poll of 1,205 adults was conducted May 29 to June 1 and has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points
