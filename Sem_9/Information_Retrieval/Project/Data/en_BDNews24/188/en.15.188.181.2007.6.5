 Dhaka, June 5 (bdnews24.com) -- Tannery owners Tuesday handed the industry ministry the first installment of money for 164 plots in tannery industrial cities of Savar and Keraniganj. Industry adviser Geeteara Safiya Choudhury hoped that the tannery industry owners would be able to open Savar Tannery Industrial City before the tenure of the caretaker government ends. The businessmen handed over a cheque to Geeteara at a meeting at the ministry. However, neither the adviser nor the businessmen could say how much money was deposited. "We want to complete the work in one and a half years. As many women work in the industry I have special interest to implement it," Geeteara said. The adviser asked the industry owners to deposit the money for remaining 31 plots by June 30. The businessmen have deposited 10 percent of the prices of plots by cheque and have to deposit the rest in nine installments in as many years. "The tannery industry is being shifted to Savar from Hazaribagh and the reason is environment pollution. But the problem has not been solved," Bangladesh Finished Leather, Leather Goods and Footwear Exporters Association president Tipu Sultan told reporters. "We have to pay 60 percent of relocation costs and the government will pay the rest," he said. The Tannery Industrial City was approved at an ECNEC meeting on August 18, 2003. Although the work of the main project is to be completed by the end of June, the work of setting up a common effluent treatment plant (CETP) has not yet started. Tenders have been floated three times for the construction of CETP. The latest two bids are under review. The tannery businessmen will be able to use their allotted plots only after completion of the CETP. The tannery industry projectits cost estimated at Tk 175.75 crorewas laid out on 200 acres in Savar and Keraniganj. The 195 plots of the project have been allotted to 153 factories. In case of single payment, the prices will be Tk 66.18 lakh per acre. The plots range from 12,000 square feet to 80,000 square feet. The government will expand the project by adding another 200 acres for finished leather goods producers. The new project will be implemented by 2010. The cost of the project has been estimated at Tk 565.54 crore. bdnews
