<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 03 (bdnews24.com) Senior Awami League leader Zillur Rahman Sunday trashed news reports on 'corruption' of Sheikh Hasina, published in some newspapers that quoted Abdul Jalil, Abdul Awal Mintoo and Sheikh Selim. He said the quarter, which was forced to lift a ban on Sheikh Hasina's homecoming, was trying to tarnish the image of the AL chief. Jalil, Mintoo and Selim were taken into remand after they were arrested on May 28-29 with suspected links to corruption and sabotage. "An evil force tried to kill Sheikh Hasina 19 times. Failing to stop her speaking for people even after 19 threats, the evil quarter is again raising baseless allegations," Zillur, the former AL general secretary, said in a statement. The AL presidium member also asked the media not to write reports based on 'speculation' and disclose the names of the sources if AL president Sheikh Hasina and other leaders were covered in news items. Strict secrecy, he said, was maintained while any remand went on. He questioned how media people had access to the remanded persons such as Mintoo, Jalil and Selim. "My request: you (media people) don't publish news items (on Sheikh Hasina and the AL), based on speculation. If you publish, name the sources," the former LGRD minister said. He said political parties in Bangladesh and other countries were run by the donations of the leaders, activists and well-wishers. "Donations of the leaders and activists cannot be called extortions," he said. bdn
