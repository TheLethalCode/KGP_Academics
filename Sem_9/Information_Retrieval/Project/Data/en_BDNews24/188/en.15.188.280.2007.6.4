 AIN AL-HILWEH, Lebanon, June 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Islamist militants killed two Lebanese soldiers at a Palestinian refugee camp in southern Lebanon on Monday in an apparent attempt to relieve pressure on al Qaeda-inspired fighters besieged by the army in the north. Two fighters of the Sunni militant group Jund al-Sham were also killed in rifle, grenade and mortar exchanges that erupted at an entrance to the big Ain al-Hilweh camp near the southern port city of Sidon, security and military sources said. Witnesses said the fighting at Ain al-Hilweh, started by Jund al-Sham on Sunday night, subsided later on Monday. Three soldiers and two civilians were also wounded. The clashes were the latest jolt to stability in Lebanon, already shaken by a protracted political crisis pitting the Western-backed government against Syria's Lebanese allies. Hundreds of civilians fled Ain al-Hilweh, a sprawling shantytown perched on a hillside above Sidon, 42 km (26 miles) south of Beirut. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah faction dominates the camp, but small Islamist groups have a foothold there and in several other refugee camps in Lebanon. The army has battled one such Sunni group, Fatah al-Islam, for more than two weeks at the Nahr al-Bared outside Tripoli, 100 km (60 miles) north of the Lebanese capital. The Ain al-Hilweh clashes were the first to erupt in other Palestinian camps in Lebanon, where there is scant support for Fatah al-Islam or its pro-Qaeda ideology. Palestinian factions held emergency talks with the army command in Sidon to ease tensions. Jund al-Sham fighters then ceded their positions to gunmen from other Islamist groups. Jund al-Sham, made up of a few dozen Palestinian and Lebanese militants, has sided with Fatah al-Islam, though they do not appear to have organisational links. Its fighters attacked the army just hours after a Fatah al-Islam commander named Abu Riyadh, who had previously belonged to Jund al-Sham, was killed in Nahr al-Bared. The violence at Nahr al-Bared is Lebanon's worst internal fighting since the 1975-1990 civil war. At least 113 people have died and about 25,000 of the camp's 40,000 refugees have fled. "The (army leadership) indicates that attacks on the army by armed groups are persisting from the Palestinian camps," the Lebanese army said in a statement late on Sunday. "It urges all Palestinian factions and Lebanese politicians to take a decisive stand so that these camps do not become a source of civil strife that aims to hit the nation's stability." Heavy machinegun fire and explosions echoed on Monday from Nahr al-Bared, where Fatah al-Islam fighters have refused to surrender, despite being outgunned and outnumbered. But the fighting was less intense than in the previous three days of army assaults on militant positions on the camp's outskirts. Prime Minister Fouad Siniora's government sees the fighting as a battle against terrorists backed by Damascus, which rejects the charge. Syria says Fatah al-Islam's leaders are on its wanted list and that such groups threaten its own security. Eleven soldiers have been killed in Nahr al-Bared since Friday, bringing the military death toll there to 45, while more than 20 people -- militants and civilians -- were killed. Fatah al-Islam said it lost five fighters and about 36 in total. While the army has not entered the camp's official boundaries, it has captured the militants' positions on its outskirts, confining militants to about a third of the camp. A 1969 agreement prevents the army from entering Lebanon's 12 Palestinian camps, home to 400,000 refugees
