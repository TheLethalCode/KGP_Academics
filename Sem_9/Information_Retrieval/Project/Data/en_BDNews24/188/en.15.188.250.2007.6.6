 MADRID, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spain coach Luis Aragones will step down from his post when his contract expires after Euro 2008. "I've told the Federation that they should be looking for a replacement for after the European championship," the 68-year-old was quoted as saying by the Spanish media on Wednesday. "It's normal that they should look for a new direction after Euro 2008." Aragones took over as Spain coach from Inaki Saez in July 2004 after heavy campaigning by the Madrid-based media, but he has enjoyed little success at the helm of the national side. Derogatory remarks about French striker Thierry Henry made to his Arsenal team mate Jose Antonio Reyes caused a controversy that marred his first season in charge and results on the pitch have been disappointing. Before last year's World Cup, Aragones said he would step down if Spain did not reach the quarter-finals, but he reversed his decision after the tournament. He came under heavy pressure to resign after back-to-back defeats against Northern Ireland and Sweden in qualification for Euro 2008, but was almost immediately given a two-year contract extension by the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF). Subsequent victories against Denmark, Iceland and Latvia have put Spain back in the running for qualification. They play Liechtenstein on Wednesday
