<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 4 (bdnews24.com)-The High Court has started delivering its verdict in a public interest litigation filed challenging the legality of the appointment and promotion of judicial officials as secretary and additional secretary under the law ministry. The High Court bench of Justice ABM Khairul Haque and Justice Syed Md Ziaul Karim Monday started delivering the verdict after hearing of the public interest litigation filed by Dr Shahdeen Malik. Dr Shahdeen Malik told bdnews24.com that the court would complete the delivery of the verdict Tuesday. On March 8, 2006, district judge Ali Ashraf Khan Lodhi was promoted to additional secretary under the law ministry. Dr Shahdeen Malik filed a petition with the High Court alleging that Ali Ashraf Khan Lodhi had been promoted without prior consultation, as per article 116 of the Constitution, with the Supreme Court. He also challenged the legality of the appointment of judicial officials as secretary and additional secretary under the Ministry of Law. After a brief hearing of the petition on Dec 12 last year, the High Court bench of Justice Nazrul Islam Chowdhury and Justice Jubair Rahman Chowdhury issued a rule on the government. The court asked the establishment secretary and cabinet secretary to explain on which legal ground they were promoting judicial officials as secretary and additional secretary under the ministry of law. The court asked them to show cause as to why such appointments and promotions would not be declared illegal. The court also asked the law secretary and Lodhi to explain why the promotion of Ali Ashraf Khan Lodhi as additional law secretary would not be declared illegal and in what capacity Lodhi was holding the post. In the final hearing of the writ petition, senior advocate Hasan Ariff, standing on behalf of the petitioner, said that as per the Constitution, the judiciary is separate from the executive. Recently, the government has completed the process of separation of judiciary. Besides, in the Mazdar Hossain case the separation of judiciary from the executive has been mentioned. But through this promotion of Lodhi the constitution and the verdict of Mazdar Hossain case have been violated. At the hearing, Advocate Kamrul Haque Siddiqui said on behalf of the law secretary, that 75 percent posts of the ministry of law had been reserved for the judicial officials. Ali Ashraf Khan Lodhi's counsel Advocate Iqbal Saeed said that Lodhi was appointed additional secretary to the ministry of law after consultation with the Supreme Court in line with the Constitution. bdnew
