 TOKYO, June 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan on Monday was grappling with a decision on four North Koreans who arrived by boat in a Japanese port, with officials saying humanitarian concerns would be given priority in deciding their fate. The three men and one woman taken into custody in northern Japan on Saturday were believed to be a family who told authorities they had been at sea in a small wooden boat since May 27 after leaving North Korea for the South. Japanese officials, including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, have said their case will be treated sympathetically. "We want to consider it from a humanitarian point of view," Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuhisa Shiozaki told a news conference, saying that police were still gathering information. The four said they had left Chongjin on the east coast of North Korea and headed south, but changed course due to heavy security and ended up at Fukaura in Japan's northern Aomori prefecture, 800 km (500 miles) to the east, a police official said. Japan can grant asylum seekers a six-month permit under its immigration law, and a 2006 "North Korean human rights" law also states the government must take measures to protect and support defectors from North Korea. Shiozaki said the Japanese government would respond in line with this law and that the safety of the four needed to be guaranteed. "Their wishes need to be considered and respected while we deal with the situation appropriately," he added. Foreign Minister Taro Aso said they may be sent to South Korea. "If South Korea can accept them, we hope to be able to do that," Aso told an Upper House panel. An Aomori police spokesman said the refugees were still at the town of Goshogawara on Monday and he had heard of no plans to move them. North Korean defectors have fled to Japanese missions and other premises in China in the past, and Tokyo has allowed them to leave for third countries. But it is rare for North Koreans to flee to Japan. Relations between Tokyo and Pyongyang, which have no diplomatic ties, could worsen if North Korea demands their return. In 1987, Pyongyang asked Tokyo to return the crew of a North Korean boat who had sought asylum in South Korea after docking at a Japanese port, but Tokyo allowed them to leave. Japan is feuding with North Korea over the fate of Japanese citizens kidnapped decades ago by Pyongyang's agents to help train spies. Abe has said that without a resolution to the abduction issue, Japan will not provide funds for a multilateral deal reached in February under which North Korea agreed to scrap its nuclear arms programme in return for energy aid
