 NAHR AL-BARED, Lebanon, June 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Lebanese troops fought al Qaeda-inspired militants at a Palestinian refugee camp and clashed with Islamists at another early on Monday as a 16-day conflict threatened to plunge Lebanon into long-term instability. Witnesses said fighting broke out between Jund al-Sham gunmen and the Lebanese army early on Monday at the northern entrance of Ain al-Hilweh, Lebanon's largest refugee camp, just hours after an earlier two-hour long overnight clash ended. Further clashes were reported since but witnesses said it appeared to be less intense than earlier fighting, in which one Lebanese soldier was killed and two were wounded, according to security sources. Other sources inside the camp said a man from Usbat al-Ansar, another Islamist group, also died. Fighting at Ain al-Hilweh first broke out on Sunday in what appeared as an attempt to open a new front for the Lebanese army to ease pressure on fighters at Nahr al-Bared camp in north Lebanon. The fighting stopped after mediators from other Palestinian groups stepped. Three soldiers and two civilians were wounded in Sunday's firefight, started by the gunmen. Jund al-Sham is a very small group that has sided with Fatah al-Islam, though there are no apparent organisational links between the two. In north Lebanon, troops pounded Nahr al-Bared sporadically throughout the night. Fatah al-Islam fighters have so far refused to lay down their weapons or surrender and have put up stiff resistance despite being vastly outgunned and outnumbered. After 12 days of sporadic shelling, the army launched a new offensive against attacked Fatah al-Islam positions at the entrances of the camp on Friday with the declared aim of wiping out the militants. The violence, which erupted on May 20, is Lebanon's worst internal fighting since the 1975-1990 civil war. At least 111 people have died and thousands have fled their homes. The government, which sees the fighting as a battle against terrorists, accuses the militants of sparking the siege by attacking army positions near Nahr al-Bared and in Lebanon's second largest city, Tripoli. The troops have seized and destroyed several positions of the Fatah al-Islam group and tightened their siege of the camp, which lies 100 km (60 miles) north of Beirut. But the militants were hitting back with grenades, mortar bombs and sniper fire. At least 10 soldiers have died since Friday, bringing the military death toll to 44 in the conflict. More than 20 people -- militants and civilians -- have died in the camp since. Fatah al-Islam said it lost five fighters and about 36 in total. At least 25,000 of Nahr al-Bared's 40,000 population have fled to other refugee camps over the past two weeks. Lebanon's anti-Syrian government says Fatah al-Islam is a Syrian tool, but Damascus denies any links to the group and says its leader, Shaker al-Abssi, is on Syria's wanted list. Abssi and his comrades say they are inspired by al Qaeda's ideology. Lebanon has been split by a seven-month-old political crisis over the opposition's demands for more say in government. The opposition includes Syria's allies, led by Hezbollah. While the army has not entered the camp's official boundaries, it has captured the militants' positions on its outskirts, confining militants to about a third of the camp. A 1969 agreement prevents the army from entering Lebanon's 12 Palestinian camps, home to 400,000 refugees
