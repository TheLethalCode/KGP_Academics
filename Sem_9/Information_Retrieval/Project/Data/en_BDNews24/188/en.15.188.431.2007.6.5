 MADRID, June 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Armed Basque separatist group ETA said it will end its 15-month-old ceasefire at midnight on Tuesday and warned Spain's government of new attacks "on all fronts". In a communique sent to Basque media, the rebels said they were calling of the truce because of "arrests, tortures and every type of persecution" by the Socialist government. ETA, that has been fighting for independence for the Basque territories for four decades, declared a ceasefire in March 2006 and had insisted that it still held despite killing two people with a bomb in Madrid airport in December. The government of Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero started exploratory peace talks in mid-2006, but broke them off at the end of the year after the airport bomb. At the time, ETA said it had not meant to kill anyone and was only seeking concessions in peace talks. "ETA wishes to announce that it is abandoning its permanent ceasefire and has decided to act on all fronts in defence of Euskal Herria," the group said, using the Basque language name for the Basque Country. The announcement, widely anticipated by state security services, could mean a big attack is imminent, analysts said. "ETA has gone back to its old ways and is betting on madness and barbarity," said Javier Madrazo, a left-wing member of the Basque Country regional government. The end of the ceasefire is also bad news for Zapatero who defied fierce criticism from opposition conservatives by opening exploratory peace talks with ETA. ETA has killed more than 800 people in four decades of armed struggle for independence of the ancient Basque territories of northern Spain and southern France. Most Basques do not want to secede from Spain, polls show, and the Basque Country already enjoys considerable autonomy. The government says it wants a negotiated solution to the Basque conflict but will negotiate with ETA only if it abandons all violent activity. ETA's banned political party ally Batasuna was not allowed to take part in last month's regional elections. "We suffer from a lack of democracy," complained ETA in its communique, adding: "The recent elections were illegitimate." When he first announced the ill-fated peace talks, Zapatero had promised to let the people of the Basque Country decide on the future of their region. A peace deal would probably have meant the release of ETA prisoners and slightly more autonomy for the Basque government. For decades, ETA sowed terror in Spain with car bombings and assassinations after beginning its struggle in the last days of the Franco dictatorship, when using the Basque language was suppressed. Nowadays, it is officially encouraged. Hundreds of arrests in the 1990s in Spain and France seriously weakened the rebels, security services believe
