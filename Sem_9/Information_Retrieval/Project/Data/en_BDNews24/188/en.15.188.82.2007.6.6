<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia is not planning to quit the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty at a conference in Vienna next week, local news agencies quoted Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov as saying on Wednesday. Russia has frozen its commitments under the 1990 pact, accusing Western partners of neglecting their obligations. Russia has threatened to quit the treaty for good if no solution is found and called for the emergency conference in Vienna. Asked whether Russia could announce quitting the CFE treaty at the conference, Lavrov was quoted as saying: "This issue will not be raised. This conference has been called so that we can once again spell out our concerns." The CFE pact, originally signed in 1990 and updated in 1999, limits the number of tanks, heavy artillery, combat aircraft and attack helicopters deployed and stored between the Atlantic and Russia's Ural mountains. Western partners have refused to ratify the amended pact until Russia pulls out of bases in Georgia and Moldova, as Moscow promised in 1999 when the treaty was reviewed in Istanbul. President Vladimir Putin said in an interview on Friday that Russia would pull out of the CFE treaty altogether if Western partners failed to ratify it, but he set no time limit. Russia last month called an emergency conference in Vienna to discuss the treaty. Disagreements over the CFE issue are likely to be one of the hot topics at the summit of Group of Eight leading nations, which starts later on Wednesday in Germany amid signs of growing tensions between Moscow and the West
