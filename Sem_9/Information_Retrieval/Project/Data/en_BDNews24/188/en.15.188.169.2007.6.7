<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iron ore output in three mines in Chhattisgarh have been disrupted following an attack by Maoist rebels on power lines in the region, an official said on Wednesday, but exports would not be immediately affected. "The loss of production is about 60,000 tonnes per day," Kumar Raghavan, spokesman for state-run National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC) that owns the mines, said. The company, which exports about 9 percent of its output, has enough stockpiles at the ports but supplies will be a worry if the shutdown is prolonged, he said. The stoppage was causing a daily loss of about 90 million rupees ($2.2 million), since the attack on May 31 in the Bastar region of mineral-rich Chhattisgarh, he said. The Maoists say they are fighting for the rights of millions of poor peasants and landless labourers in India. It could take another week to restore the power supply to the region, Raghavan said, adding the company would try to make up for the loss of production. NMDC's annual iron ore production is more than 25 million tonnes, and it accounts for about 15 percent of iron ore production in India. The majority of the company's output is from Bailadila region, known for its reserves of top quality iron ore. The disruption has stopped iron ore movement from the Bailadila mines to steel and sponge iron plants around Raipur, besides major customers, Raghavan said. Its big customers include Ispat Industries, Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd. and Vikram Ispat
