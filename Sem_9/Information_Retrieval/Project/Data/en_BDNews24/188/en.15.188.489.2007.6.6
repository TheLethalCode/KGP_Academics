 JOHANNESBURG, June 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa's manufacturing output growth slowed to 3.8 percent year-on-year in April, suggesting the key sector could put a brake on economic growth this year. Statistics South Africa said growth in volume terms eased from an upwardly revised 5.5 percent in March, with month-on-month production contracting a seasonally adjusted 1.9 percent. Analysts said the number did not bode well for the country's economic growth outlook for the year. "That's a bad number, significantly lower than what we expected. It will impact on our forecast for economic growth for the whole year," said Nico Kelder, economist at Efficient Group. Manufacturing is the second-biggest sector in Africa's biggest economy after financial services, accounting for nearly 17 percent of gross domestic product. Expansion in the sector slowed to 4.7 percent in the first quarter of this year, from 8.3 percent growth in the fourth quarter of 2006. Africa's biggest economy has expanded by around 5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) a year for the past three years, but higher interest rates are widely expected to curb robust domestic demand in 2007, slowing growth. "I think this will mean slower GDP growth. This is partly in response to the global economy's reaction to higher interest rates," said Colen Garrow, economist at Brait, referring to an upward rates cycle in most industrial nations. RATE HIKE But some analysts said the disappointing growth was unlikely to dissuade the central bank from resuming raising rates again on Thursday after pausing an upward cycle at its February and April policy meetings. The Reserve Bank hiked its key repo rate by two percentage points to 9.0 percent from June to December last year. A Reuters poll last week showed 14 of 17 economists were predicting another repo rate rise of at least 50 basis points to 9.5 percent, following inflation data and credit growth surprised on the upside. "I think the Reserve Bank will keep this in mind when they decide on interest rates (on Thursday) but I still think they are going to raise the rate," Kelder said. Stats S.A. said on a seasonally adjusted basis, manufacturing volumes fell by 0.2 percent in the three months to April due to a decline in the petroleum, chemical products, rubber and plastics division. The slower year-on-year growth was in line with a decline in the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) -- which points to trends in manufacturing ahead of official data -- to 57.9 in April from 60.5 in March, indicating slowing underlying growth. The PMI fell slightly to 57.2 in May. Economists said manufacturing may have been affected by a recovery in the rand currency from lows reached in 2006. "The data shows that the manufacturing sector is feeling the pinch from the recovery of the rand through the course of April and also signs that consumption expenditure is edging a bit off," said George Glynos, analyst at ETM. The currency recovered from a 3-1/4 year low reached in late October last year, and started the year at 6.98 to the dollar. It is about two percent weaker against the dollar so far this ye
