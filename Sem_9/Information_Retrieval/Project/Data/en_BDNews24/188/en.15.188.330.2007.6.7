<TITLE> Honda, Ford gain in key quality survey </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 DETROIT, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Honda Motor Co Ltd took the top ranking among mass-market automakers in a closely watched quality survey released on Wednesday, while Ford Motor Co showed strong gains at a crucial point in its turnaround effort. The survey represented a setback for Toyota Motor Corp's flagship brand, which slipped to sixth place, and provided some vindication for Ford, which is expected to be overtaken by Toyota as the no 2 automaker in the United States this year. The survey, known as the JD Power and Associates Initial Quality Study, put Ford's Lincoln as the third-highest ranked brand, up from no 12 a year earlier. Lincoln trailed no 1 Porsche AG and Toyota's luxury Lexus, which ranked no 2. The rankings are used in marketing campaigns and seen by some as influential in shaping consumer perceptions. Honda, meanwhile, eclipsed larger rival Toyota to become the highest-ranking mainstream brand, with strong showings for its Civic sedan and CR-V sport-utility vehicle. Toyota has come under scrutiny over whether it can sustain its reputation for sterling quality in the face of sales growth that has made it the world's largest automaker. While the Japanese automaker had 11 models that scored top ratings in their segments in last year's survey, Toyota took just four awards this year -- behind Ford with five. Toyota executives said the JD Power survey was only one indicator of quality based on the first three months of vehicle ownership and consumer reaction to vehicle designs. Warranty data and longer-running studies all point to steady or improving quality for Toyota, the executives said. "The bottom line is consumer loyalty," said Toyota spokesman Irv Miller. Neal Oddes, JD Power's director of product research, said quality across the industry had improved dramatically over the past 20 years, meaning the gap between the best and worst brands had narrowed sharply. DaimlerChrysler AG's Mercedes brand showed the biggest gain in rankings, jumping to the no 5 spot from no 25 in last year's survey. In addition to their marketing value for automakers fighting for a share of a declining US vehicle market, quality rankings influence resale values and are read as a proxy for the warranty costs of automakers. American automakers, including Ford, have long argued consumer perception of their quality has lagged real improvements in engineering. Ford, which is struggling to build momentum for a turnaround effort that hinges on reversing a decline in its US market share, had four of the top 10 brands. Ford's Land Rover also showed improvement, but remained the lowest-ranked brand with an average of 170 reported problems per 100 vehicles, sharply higher than the 91 recorded for industry-leader Porsche. JD Power based its study on responses from 97,000 respondents who bought 2007 model cars and trucks. General Motors Corp, the largest US automaker, failed to place any brands above the industry average. Hyundai Motor Co, third last year, dropped to 12th place. GM spokesman Tom Wilkinson said the no 1 US automaker needed to do better. "It's so competitive and the pressure is not going to let up," he added
