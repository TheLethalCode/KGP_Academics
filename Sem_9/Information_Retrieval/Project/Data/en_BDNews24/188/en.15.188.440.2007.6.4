 AMSTERDAM, June 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Dutch businessman who started tours to the warehouse in which a kidnapped brewing magnate was held 24 years ago has called on Amsterdam's city council to keep it open, Dutch media reported on Monday. "The warehouse is of historical interest," Dutch daily Algemeen Dagblad quoted businessman Sjerp Jaarsma as saying, after the council called for the warehouse, situated near the port of Amsterdam, to be torn down as a condition of renewing the land lease with its owner. In a notorious case, Heineken Breweries chairman Alfred Heineken, then the Netherlands' richest man, was kidnapped along with his chauffeur in 1983. He was freed after three weeks, during which his kidnappers tormented him by repeatedly playing Marlene Dietrich's song 'Ich hab noch einen koffer in Berlin', after payment of a ransom of 35 million guilders (about 16 million euros). Jaarsma, who started his weekly tours to the warehouse three years ago, said he was willing to buy the facility and transfer it to a recreation park in the northern Netherlands should the council insist on tearing it down. "Maybe I can start a criminal museum. But it really belongs in Amsterdam," he said. Heineken declined to comment
