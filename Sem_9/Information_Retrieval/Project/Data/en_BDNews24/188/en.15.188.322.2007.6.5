 BANGKOK, June 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thailand's army-appointed cabinet agreed on Tuesday to let political parties resume activities days after ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra's was disbanded. But the formation of new parties was still banned as it would take three weeks for a new law to be written on forming them, Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont said. That means Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai (Thais Love Thais) cannot reform under a new name, which it is expected to do before general elections the government has promised for December, until that law is passed. (update) The elections will be staged under a new constitution and a draft, much criticised for appearing to take authority away from politicians and give it to bureaucrats, is scheduled to be put to a referendum in September. Surayud told reporters the resumption of political activities would "allow all sides to communicate with their people to bring understanding on the constitutional draft, which will lead to a referendum". The cabinet planned to approve the party formation law next week, before forwarding it to the army-appointed parliament for passage, Surauyd said. "We hope to get the National Legislative Assembly to pass it in two weeks after that," he said. The Constitutional Tribunal ordered the dissolution of Thai Rak Thai for election fraud last week and banned 111 of its leaders, including Thaksin, from politics for five years. But it absolved the Democrat Party, Thailand's oldest and the main opposition to Thaksin until he was ousted last September, of any wrongdoing in elections early last year. The verdict upset Thaksin supporters, who demonstrated against the generals who overthrew Thaksin and the government they appointed. Acting Thai Rak Thai leader Chaturon Chaisang said the verdict was part of the generals' post-coup "roadmap" aimed at neutering Thaksin's political network and strengthening his opponents in the elections. "These attempts have been planned in the roadmap to either bring extinction to the former Thai Rak Thai or bring grave weakness to the party," Chaturon told Reuters Television. "We shall wait and see whether they will materialise.
