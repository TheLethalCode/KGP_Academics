 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com) - Police have opened an investigation into the case against Khaleda Zia and others on their alleged links to the August 21, 2004 grenade attack on an Awami League rally that left 24 people dead. Cox's Bazar Awami League worker Badar Aziz Uddin filed the case on Tuesday against 28 people, including Khaleda's son Tarique Rahman and Jamaat-e-Islami chief Motiur Rahman Nizami, with the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court in Dhaka.

Paltan police chief Farid Ahmed told bdnews24.com on Wednesday that they had already opened an investigation into the case. He said an earlier case had been filed following the incident.

Police will arrest those found linked to the incident, during the investigation, he added.
