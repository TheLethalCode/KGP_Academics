<TITLE> Troubled Oriental gets new executive director </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jun 3 (bdnews24.com)  The central bank Sunday extended the suspension of Oriental Bank's board of directors by one year. Bangladesh Bank, meanwhile, appointed AH Tawfique Ahmed as executive director to look after the bank that is currently under a six-month moratorium for mismanagement. On Aug 6, the BB suspended the board of directors of the troubled bank after its management failed to turn in satisfactory explanations on protecting depositors' interest. The regulator labelled the bank as bankrupt after investigations found that the bank's former chairman Obaidul Karim stole Tk 596 crore from the vault in connivance with the then managing director CM Koyes Sami. Sami is now in jail but Karim is at large. Tawfique, a former central bank deputy governor, is expected to take over Monday. "I've nothing to say. Let me take over first," Ahmed told bdnews24.com after he was approached to comment on the new development. M Assaduzzaman Khan, who was in charge of overseeing the bank after it fell into chaos, will continue as managing director. Khan had earlier discharged the responsibilities as administrator of the bank's board of directors. bdnews24
