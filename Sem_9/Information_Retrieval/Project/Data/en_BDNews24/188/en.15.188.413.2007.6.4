The officials said the clashes occurred when police searched for a rebel hideout on Saturday in a forest between the villages of Solnechnoye and Nuradilovo in the Khasavyurt area, which borders Chechnya and has a large Chechen community. "Two police were killed, one wounded. Three fighters were also killed," said Anzhela Martirosova, spokeswoman for the regional Interior Ministry. The clashes lasted for more than five hours
