<TITLE> Hasina raps govt on full-year budget </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 6 (bdnews24.com) -- Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina has said the constitution does not allow the caretaker government to present a budget the way it has been planned. "No representation, no taxation," Hasina told reporters Wednesday after visiting AL leader Zillur Rahman at Ibrahim Cardiac Hospital (BIRDEM). Hasina said the government could have designed a short-time budget and referred to the 1996 caretaker government that had laid out a budget for two months. The caretaker government is set to announce a full-year budget Thursday for fiscal 2007-08. Hasina said elections should have been held long before the budget is presented. Hasina once more welcomed the anticorruption drive but termed the arrests of AL leaders unfortunate. "People know how we go along. It's my request not to slander us. People will try the slanderers," Hasina said. Hasina said people want quick polls. "They want to see the election process begin." Hasina asked the government to take immediate steps to check soaring prices of daily essentials. On Tuesday's case against Khaleda Zia and others for their alleged links to the August 21, 2004 grenade attack on an AL rally, the AL chief said: "I don't know how the case was filed." "We had a list of people who died and sustained injuries in the attack. The treatment of the injured people was funded by the party. I don't know if this complainant (Badar Aziz Uddin) is on that list. I can't remember if there is any such name on the list. But the matter should be investigated." She said: "The attempt to make AL leaders thieves is unfortunate." On a firm note, Hasina said she had never asked anybody for a single penny in her life. "I have never done that, but I am being implicated." She trashed news reports that Hasina owns million-dollar property. The AL chief asked the government for quick polls that would be free, fair and peaceful. "Let people form a government on their own." Asked about restrictions on entry to Hasina's Sudha Sadan home, she said she did not understand why people had been harassed. The police Wednesday barred AL leaders and activists to enter Sudha Sadan, saying they cannot let more than four persons in at a time. Sub-inspector Giasuddin who was on duty at Sudha Sadan said they have orders not to allow more than four persons to get in at a time. bdnews
