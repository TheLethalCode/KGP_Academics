 LONDON, June 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's leading share index edged up early on Tuesday, helped by a turnaround in the Chinese markets and gains in insurers and index heavyweight Vodafone. At 0804 GMT the FTSE 100 was up 9.6 points, or 0.14 percent at 6,674.3. Chinese shares recovered to be up 2.6 percent on rumours that authorities would make a policy statement to restore investor confidence after sliding as much as 7 percent earlier in the day and 8 percent in the previous session. "All things considered things aren't too bad given the history of 2007 when London and the rest of the world were rudely affected by the China sell-off in February," said Tim Hughes, head of sales trading at IG Index. "The latest shock to the system has been taken in its stride (and) is probably indicative of continuing very bullish sentiment." U.S. stocks rose overnight with the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P500 edging up to closing records as higher energy shares and a fresh round of takeovers offset concerns about the sharp sell-off in Chinese stocks. Vodafone gained 1 percent as traders cited market talk that the mobile phone group could be a break-up target. No one at Vodafone was immediately available for comment. Insurers were also in demand after traders said Merrill Lynch upgraded its rating on shares in Standard Life and Old Mutual to 'buy'. Standard Life climbed 3.6 percent, while Old Mutual climbed 1.6 percent and Resolution added 0.6 percent. Also in the financial sector, Royal Bank of Scotland tacked on 0.3 percent after the British bank said it expected its UK bad debts to have fallen in the first half of this year to help it beat forecasts for underlying earnings. The bank also said it was not in talks with Bank of America regarding an attempt to resolve the US bank's disputed purchase of LaSalle Bank, the US arm of ABN AMRO that RBS wants to take over. United Utilities surged 4 percent to top the FTSE 100 gainers after it reported a 16 percent increase in year profit, and said it was putting its electricity distribution assets up for sale. In the oil and gas sector, both Royal Dutch Shell and BG Group advanced 0.5 percent and BP tacked on 0.1 percent as they were supported by price of Brent crude above $70 a barrel. Among other individual movers, Associated British Food was up 1.7 percent at 948 pence after JPMorgan initiated its coverage with an "overweight" rating, with a price target of 1,160 pence. GlaxoSmithKline put on 1 percent as the first US weekly prescription data from IMS Health since a safety row blew up over Avandia showed demand for its diabetes drug holding up better than some investors had feared. Daily Mail & General Trust, however, fell 2.3 percent to top the losers' list after Morgan Stanley downgraded its recommendation of the stock to "equal-weight" from "overweight". Vedanta Resources added 0.3 percent. The miner said its Indian subsidiary, Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd, had launched a global American depositary receipt (ADR) offer of 125 million shares. Carphone Warehouse advanced 3.9 percent after Europe's biggest mobile retailer posted annual headline pretax profit ahead of the average market forecast and said the outlook for the group was positive
