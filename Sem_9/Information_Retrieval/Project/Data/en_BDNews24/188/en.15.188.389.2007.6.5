<TITLE> Zimbabwe says to control strategic mining sectors </TITLE>

 WINDHOEK, June 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe's government is to take control of strategic resource sectors such as uranium under a new law due to take effect by year-end, but in other sectors local businesses will take majority stakes, the mines minister said on Tuesday. Companies such as Impala Platinum and Rio Tinto which are already operating in the country would be treated differently under the new law, which will require 51 percent local ownership of mining firms, Amos Midzi said at a metals conference in Namibia. Controversy has swirled for years around Zimbabwe's proposed new mining law as investors feared the government would seize majority stakes in all mining firms. "I would like to dispel this notion that Zimbabwe wants to nationalise its mining industry," Midzi said in a speech at the conference. "It's not that the government will take 51 percent in every instance, it's only in selected minerals or mines." He told reporters afterwards that sectors such as uranium, coal and methane gas would likely require control by the government. "We are looking at what we have defined as strategic minerals, uranium for instance. We are saying that as far as uranium is concerned it's untouchable by any private company." In those strategic sectors, the government might hold up to 100 percent of mining firms, with a minimum of 51 percent if joint-venture partners are used. The value of the mineral deposit would be converted into equity to give the state control or a stake, he added. For other minerals, the government might not have any shareholding, but local businesses would take stakes to meet the requirements of the law, which is due to be passed by parliament in August or September, and take effect before the end of 2007, he added. Companies already operating in the country would be treated on a case-by-case basis, with the government recognising any social improvements they have contributed. The chairman of Rio Tinto, which owns diamond operations in the country, has already had discussions with President Robert Mugabe, Midzi added. South Africa's Implats, the world's second-biggest platinum producer, has already sealed an agreement with Zimbabwe that gives it credit for improvements such as roads and housing it had built. "Companies that have a good, commendable track record in terms of their social responsibility, we will take that into account," he said. "On Implats, we have not completed the discussions as such, but the agreement recognises what Implats has done." The Mines Ministry last year said the cabinet had approved changes to the mining law to indigenise 51 percent in some instances of all foreign-owned companies, with 25 percent going to the state for free. The proposals were later withdrawn for further consultations, but Mugabe has insisted that locals should take control of the country's rich mineral resources. Government empowerment has worried investors in one of the few sectors of Zimbabwe's economy that has continued to attract foreign capital following the collapse of the key agriculture sector, which critics blame on Mugabe's seizure of white-owned farms for blacks under a land redistribution drive
