<TITLE> UK May retail sales growth at 6-month low: BRC </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, June 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British retail sales growth slowed to its weakest rate in six months in May as wet weather hit the clothing sector, a survey showed on Tuesday. The British Retail Consortium/KPMG monthly sales monitor showed like-for-like sales were up 1.8 percent last month on a year ago. Total sales, which includes new floorspace, was up 4.0 percent on the year. Both rates were the weakest since November last year and the BRC blamed rain and the cumulative impact of four interest rate rises since last August, most recently at the start of last month. "The poor weather over both bank holiday weekends really had an impact, particularly for children's clothing and footwear," said Helen Dickinson, head of retail at KPMG. The figures are likely to reinforce expectations the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 5.5 percent this week but most economists still expect the central bank to lift borrowing costs again later this year. The BRC results contrast with figures from the Confederation of British Industry which suggested retail sales growth remained buoyant in May. Still, experts expect consumer demand to slow over the course of the year given interest rates have already risen a full percentage point since last August and look likely to go up at least once more this year. "The results for May -- and those for April for that matter -- are below the trend of the first quarter of the year and represent the beginning of a lower growth phase as the comparatives become tougher and the outlook less favourable," KPMG's Dickinson said
