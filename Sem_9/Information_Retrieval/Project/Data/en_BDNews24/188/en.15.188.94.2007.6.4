<TITLE> Yunus a good businessman: Hasina </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 4 (bdnews24.com) -- Sheikh Hasina has castigated Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, saying he can make profit by sucking poor people's blood but politics is not his cup of tea. In an interview aired Sunday on Indian news channel CNN-IBN, Hasina termed Yunus a "good businessman". "He knows how to make profit. He knows how to make money," Hasina told the channel. The former prime minister said Yunus knows how to spin profit "by sucking blood of thousands of poor men and women". Yunus's Grameen Bank lends money to the poor, mostly women, to start small businesses or rearing cattle at home. The bank claims it is contributing to reducing extreme poverty in the country, but many dispute the claim. "Yunus's programmes do not reduce but reproduce poverty. What he showed as solutions to eradicating poverty was actually a myth of poverty alleviation mechanism," says economist Anu Mohammed. On Feb 22, Yunus launched his political party Nagorik Shakti and rolled out a slogan "Bangladesh Egie Cholo" which translates "Bangladesh, go ahead" in English. He had announced that his new platform would contest elections in 300 constituencies. He had said he felt compelled to join politics because most politicians in the country are "stinking corrupt". "I know politics makes people controversial. But I am ready to take that risk if you think my involvement in politics would help create a new political ambiance," he said in an open letter to people on Feb 11. Yunus, who earned the fame as the banker to the poor by the grace of the western media, bundled out his political effort on May 3. His point to the pullback from politics was that he had failed to form a team, which would steer his dream of turning the impoverished country into a prosperous one. bdnew
