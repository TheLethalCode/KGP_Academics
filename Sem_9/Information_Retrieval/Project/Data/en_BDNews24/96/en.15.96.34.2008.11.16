 Dhaka, Nov 16 (bdnews24.com) - The Appellate Division has stayed a High Court order that ruled the Truth Commission unconstitutional and illegal. Justice MA Matin stayed the ruling for a month on Sunday, ordering the government to lodge a regular appeal against the ruling by that time. The High Court bench of justices Mir Hasmat Ali and Shamim Hasnain on Nov. 13 declared the Voluntary Information Disclosure Ordinance 2007 illegal and in breach of the constitution on a writ petition challenging the commission's legality. Attorney general Salahuddin Ahmed represented the government and advocates Toufiq Newaz and Adilur Rahman Khan the petitioners in Sunday's hearing on the government's request for a stay order. "We asked for the suspension of the High Court ruling," said attorney general Salahuddin Ahmed. "A regular appeal will be filed after we receive a copy of the High Court ruling," he added. The Truth Commission was ordered to stop its work after the ruling. "But since the High Court order has been suspended, truth Commission can now carry on with its functions," said the attorney general. President Iajuddin Ahmed signed into law the ordinance on June 8, which came to be known as the Truth and Accountability Commission ordinance. Supreme Court lawyer Adilur Rahman Khan, executive director of UBINIG Farida Akter, Awami League's women affairs secretary Dr Dipu Moni and acting director of Odhikar Nasiruddin Elan filed the writ petition with the High Court on Aug 28. The petition challenged the legality of the ordinance. bdnew
