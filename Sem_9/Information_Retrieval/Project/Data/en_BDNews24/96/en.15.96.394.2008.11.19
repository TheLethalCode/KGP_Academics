 PESHAWAR, Pakistan, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A missile struck a house in a northwestern Pakistan on Wednesday, killing at least four suspected militants including two foreigners, residents and intelligence officials said. Several people were wounded in the attack, in the Janikhel tribal area. Janikhel does not belong to one of Pakistan's seven semi-autonomous tribal regions, but borders North Waziristan -- a militant hotbed where suspected U.S. drone aircraft have launched a series of missile strikes in recent months. Senior police official Mohammad Alam Shinwari confirmed the attack but said it was unclear who was responsible. A local resident said it was a drone attack that happened before dawn. US strikes have focused on North and South Waziristan where at least 20 missile attacks and a cross-border commando raid have killed scores of people since September
