 Dhaka, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com)  Setting to rest days of swirling rumours and speculations about fresh schedules, the general and Upazila elections will be held as scheduled on Dec. 18 and Dec. 28, as previously announced by the Election Commission, according to a government spokesman. Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman told a press conference at the Chief Adviser's Office on Wednesday that "since the proposals of the government and the Election Commission did not produce consensus in both alliances, the parliamentary and Upazila elections will now be held on the previous schedules." He spoke of the government's efforts on meeting the BNP-led alliance's demands. "Though demanded at the eleventh hour, the government after discussions with the Election Commission and two main political alliances proposed that the parliamentary elections be rescheduled for December 28, ten days later than the previous date. "[It proposed that ] The state of emergency be lifted at a logical time before the elections considering the pre-polls law and order, Upazila elections be held on January 8 next year and utmost care and procedural transparency on implementation of clause 91(E) of RPO be taken. "On September 20 the election date was announced for December 18 in the light of the previous commitment." "The government and the Election Commission sincerely hope that for the sake of greater interests of the nation and sustainable democratic practices all political parties will take part in the elections on schedules. "The government and the Eelction Commission will take all precautionary measures to ensure peace, order and security for holding the polls in the scheduled time." Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda had told reporters in the afternoon that the date could be pushed back to Dec 28 on political consensus. In that case, fresh schedules would be announced on Thursday, he had further said, adding the EC had sent its proposals to the government. "Upazila election date can also be rescheduled if there is a consensus among all parties." BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia on Monday gave the government 48 hours to meet four demands, including a fresh election schedule, if it wanted the four-party alliance to go to the elections. Five advisers of the government on Tuesday evening met her and also Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina for discussions. bdnews24.com ad
