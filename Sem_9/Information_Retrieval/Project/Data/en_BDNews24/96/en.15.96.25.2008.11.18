<TITLE> Tibetans could push for independence: PM in exile </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 DHARAMSALA, India, Tue Nov 18, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tibetans could push for independence from China if exile groups meeting this week in India decide that is the only option left open to them, the prime minister of the Tibetan government-in-exile said on Tuesday. Frustrated at the lack of progress in official talks with Beijing, hundreds of Tibetans are meeting in the northern Indian town of Dharamsala, the exiled Tibetans' headquarters, searching for a way forward. Some are demanding the Dalai Lama's long-standing "Middle Way", which advocates greater autonomy within China, be replaced by demands for outright independence. "If the majority of the people offer some different way than the present (Middle Way), then of course we would gladly follow that," Samdhong Rinpoche, the Tibetan exile prime minister, told reporters. "If the parliament by majority makes the decision that we should go for independence, then of course there is no way to escape that," Rinpoche said. "The parliament has the final decision making power." Some analysts see the meeting as an attempt to persuade the Chinese that if they don't compromise, more radical elements will surface against Chinese rule. China this month rejected demands for autonomy during talks between Chinese officials and envoys of the Dalai Lama. The Tibetan leader, who fled into exile in 1959 after a failed uprising, recently hinted his push for an autonomous Tibet had failed, and speculation has grown he wants to step back from day-to-day political leadership. After being hospitalised with abdominal pain in August and undergoing gallstone surgery last month, he is not attending the meeting in Dharamsala. Some Tibetan activists say he is laying the ground for a possible successor. At the latest talks in Beijing, the Tibetans presented a "memorandum on genuine autonomy", which stressed their right to create their own regional government and to be represented in decision-making in the Chinese government. It also called for protecting the culture and identity of minority nationalities in Tibet, and preserving the environment. Chinese officials have said the door to Tibetan independence or semi-independence would never open, and Beijing has already stepped up security inside Tibet. A Tibetan source, who asked not to be identified for fear of retribution, said security had been noticeably boosted in Tibet's capital, Lhasa. Tibetans without Lhasa residence permits, including pilgrims and businesspeople, are being forced out of the city, the source said. "This is a big sweep out," the source added. Police and armed soldiers patrol the streets, and there are few tourists, the source said. Government agencies are also being asked to have people on duty 24 hours a day. "It was more relaxed after the Olympics," the source said
