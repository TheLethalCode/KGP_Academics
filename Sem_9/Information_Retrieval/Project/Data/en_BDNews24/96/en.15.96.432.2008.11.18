 Dhaka, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com) - The High Court on Tuesday excused the editor, publisher and a reporter of Dainik Prothom Alo from personal appearance in a contempt of court case following publication of a report on disposal of cases by the Supreme Court. A High Court bench of Justice Syed Mahmud Hossain and Justice Kamrul Islam Siddiqui also granted them four weeks to answer the contempt of court charge. Dr Kamal Hossain represented the trio, appealing to the court to acquit editor Matiur Rahman, publisher Mahfuz Anam and reporter Mizanur Rahman Khan of one of the country's highest-circulation Bangla dailies. The High Court on Nov 11 ruled against the three, after a contempt petition was filed by Barrister Munshi Ahsan Karim on Nov 9, the day the report was published. The report bearing the headline "Rulings in 298 cases given in 315 minutes" alleges the High Court bench headed by Justice Sharif Uddin Chaklader "bailed out murder suspects" even after charges were pressed. The report also says that a prominent member of the legal profession, Kamal Hossain, wanted an investigation into the bench's rulings by the Supreme Judicial Council. The paper added that on Aug 28, rulings in a total of 434 cases were given by six benches, including 298 by Chaklader's bench, at an average rate of one ruling every 63 seconds. The five other benches mentioned were Bench Nos 11, 12, 15, 18, and 20. bdnews
