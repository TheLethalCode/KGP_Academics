 BANGKOK, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The leader of a long-running anti-government street protest in Thailand called for a major rally on Sunday to oust the "murderous government" after one of his supporters was killed by a grenade.

However, analysts always said the lull would almost certainly be only temporary, and so Thursday's attack comes as no surprise. Last month, one renegade old general threatened to launch daily bomb attacks against the PAD
