<TITLE> Japan opposition seeks to force early election </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's opposition stepped up efforts on Tuesday to force an early election by stalling key bills including help for struggling banks, a strategy that threatens to further paralyse an economy in recession. The bickering could delay a government bill to allow the injection of public funds into regional and other banks, mainly to facilitate loans to smaller firms facing a credit crunch. Legislation to extend Japan's naval mission in support of U.S.-led operations in Afghanistan after it expires in January has also become ensnared in the manoeuvering, risking a rocky start to relations with U.S. President-elect Barack Obama. "Things have gotten stalled in political wrangling and that can't be good either for the economy or the confidence of investors in the political mechanism," said Robert Feldman, chief economist at Morgan Stanley in Tokyo. Japan's economy slipped into recession for the first time in seven years in the July-September quarter, as the global financial crisis slashed overseas demand and a strong yen made Japanese exports less price competitive. The main opposition Democratic Party is refusing to bring the refuelling and bank recapitalisation bills to a vote in the upper house, which it controls together with small allies, media and ruling party executives said. Delaying the first could create friction with Obama's new administration, while stalling the latter would spell bad news for some regional banks and their smaller corporate customers. "In Japan, the big banks are not really in trouble so this is not about the overall economy," said Martin Schulz, an economist at Fujitsu Research Institute. "But it is very possible that some regional economies will get into trouble and injections would be very important to stabilise the regions." ELECTION TIMING The ruling bloc can enact bills rejected by the upper house by using its two-thirds majority in the lower house, but if the upper house declines to hold a vote, 60 days must elapse from the time the legislation was first approved by the lower chamber. That means parliament's current session would need to be extended beyond its scheduled end on Nov. 30 into early January to enact both the naval mission law and the banking legislation. The Democrats argue that a refusal by Prime Minister Taro Aso to say when he would submit an extra budget to fund a promised 5 trillion yen ($52 billion) package of stimulus steps means he has gone back on a promise to put the economy first. Behind the political squabbling, though, is a clash over the timing of an election for the more powerful lower house. No election need be held until September 2009. But with media surveys showing that Aso's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its junior partner could well lose power, Democratic Party leader Ichiro Ozawa is keen for an early vote. Those same surveys are making Aso equally reluctant. The 68-year-old scion of a wealthy political family took office in September promising to bolster the economy with tax cuts and spending, and expecting that a jump in popularity ratings would set the stage for an early election. An LDP victory in the lower house would not end the problem of a divided parliament, but would at least give Aso a public mandate. Aso is the third prime minister to take office since the last general election in 2005. But Aso's initial support was less than he had hoped and his ratings have been slipping ever since, prompting media to begin muttering that the ruling party may dump yet another leader. A weekend survey by TV Asahi showed support for Aso's cabinet sank to 29.6 percent, down 13.2 points from last month and under the 30 percent seen by analysts as vital to political survival. To be sure, Aso's personal ratings regularly out poll those for Ozawa, and the prime minister himself has ruled nothing out. While some pundits are now predicting that no election will be held at least until after the national budget for the next fiscal year is enacted in March, others are not so sure. "Part of the question is, how will Ozawa's gambit play out? If he lures Aso to extend the parliament session then what happens?" said Sophia University professor Koichi Nakano. "Given the shape Aso finds himself in, Ozawa may be able to destabilise the LDP quite a lot.
