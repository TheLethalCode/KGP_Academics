 Dhaka, Nov 16(bdnews24.com)- The advisory council committee on administrative reforms and good governance has been directed to formulate necessary recommendations with a view to eliminating the complexities centering on the 27th BCS exam results, said the chief adviser's press secretary on Sunday. "The advisory council directed the committee to present recommendations before it as soon as possible," Fahim Munaim told reporters after the advisory council's regular meeting chaired by the CA at the latter's office. The PSC originally posted an advertisement on June 28 2005 for the 27th BCS exams. As many as 1,36,105 people applied and 1,18,339 took the exams. Of them, over 26,000 examinees passed written tests. The authorities recalled 16,418 for vivas. The PSC declared 3,567 candidates successful after the oral tests, asking authorities to appoint them. However, allegations of question leaks, politicisation, bribery and nepotism had marred the transparency of the 'first batch' results. The interim cabinet cancelled the viva results on May 30 2007, to "restore trust of the people in the Public Service Commission" and establish transparency in the wake of allegations of irregularities. The new results were published on Sept 23 after 16 months of dispute and legal wrangles. Some 10,412 examinees passed in the 'second batch' after new vivas were given. However, the government's decision to recall the original results triggered outrage among the first qualified batch, who have called for the removal of the PSC chairman and have held ongoing protests, including hunger strikes. bdnews24.com/
