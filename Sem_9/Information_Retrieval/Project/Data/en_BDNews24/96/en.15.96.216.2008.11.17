 Dhaka, Nov 16 (bdnews24.com)  Hearing on a petition that urged the court to declare former Jamaat-e-Islami chief Ghulam Azam, current chief Motiur Rahman Nizami, secretary general Ali Ahsan Md Mujahid and 33 others war criminals and stop them running elections has been reset for Tuesday. Assistant judge Iftekhar Ahmed of the Dhaka District Judge's Court fixed the date on Sunday on an appeal for time by the plaintiff. He will also hold a hearing on the acceptability of the case. A hearing will also be held to determine if the proceedings of the case can be carried out under the civil law. Lawyers Liton Mian, Md Safayet Hossain Rajib and Rajib Ahmed lodged the case as plaintiff on Thursday. The petition appealed to the court to issue an injunction, barring them from filing nomination for the polls, K Mohibul Hasan Apel, the lawyer had said. The deadline for filing nomination to the Election Commission is Nov. 20. Jamaat's assistant secretary general Md Quamaruzzaman, Delwar Hossain Saidee and Moulana AKM Yusuf, BNP leader Salauddin Quader Chowdhury and his late father Fazlul Quader Chowdhury are also among the people whom the petition wants barred. The petition made the chief election commissioner, the secretary at the Election Commission Secretariat and the deputy commissioner of Dhaka district as litigants. A good number of political and socio-cultural organisations have been demanding the EC to declare a number of Jamaat leaders "war criminals" and stop them from contesting the general elections slated for Dec. 18. They also urged the EC not to register Jamaat-e-Islami as a political party. On Nov. 4, the Sectors Commanders' Forum, a forum comprising the sector commanders during the 1971 war of independence from Pakistan, unveiled a primary list of 50 war criminals, most of them from Jamaat. The forum had also demanded an election ban on them and their trial fro alleged war crimes. bdne
