<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court has ordered the government to examine the presence of melamine in the powdered milk brands through the World Health Organisation. A five-member Appellate Division bench led by chief justice MM Ruhul Amin passed the ruling on Monday by amending the High Court order. The High Court on Nov. 10 directed the government to test samples of all brands of powdered milk in the laboratories of the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission and BSTI, and submit the reports to the court. After Monday's ruling, advocate Manjil Morshed for the writ petitioner, told bdnews24.com that the Supreme Court upheld the High Court order. The Supreme Court also asked the government to test the samples of the brands in any European country through the UN's WHO, he said. The High Court would now be able to make a decision after examining the reports received from organizations in Bangladesh and abroad, he added. In the hearing barrister Rokanuddin Mahmud represented Nestl and advocate Mahmudul Islam Diploma and Red Cow. The counsels of the milk powder brands appealed to the court to extend the duration of the High Court order that withdrew the ban on sale of five powdered milk until the test reports were available. The Supreme Court would go on vacation next month and if the report did not come by that time, it would be difficult for them to get a time extension, they argued. Morshed, the lawyer for the petitioner, Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh, a human-rights organisation, opposed the plea for the extension. The writ petitioners did not have any objections in testing the brands abroad. But the test should be in Europe, he added. The High Court in its on Nov. 10 ruling ordered the health ministry to test for presence of melamine contamination in eight powdered milk brands. These are Diploma, Red Cow, Dano, Yashli-1, Yashli-2, Sweet Baby, Nido and Enline, and submit reports to court in 21 days. The government has been ordered to collect samples from market in presence of representatives of the chemistry department of the University of Dhaka, BAEC, BSTI and the owners. The court had asked the government to seek the views of WHO about whether the presence of melamine is harmful to health and present those before the court. It had directed the government to publish the reports in the media so that people can make an informed decision about buying powdered milk. On Nov. 6, the High Court summoned test reports on presence of melamine in the powdered milk brands and the government submitted the report to the High Court the next day. On Oct. 23, the High Court ordered the government to stop sale and display of the eight milk powder brands that had been sent to Thailand for test. bdne
