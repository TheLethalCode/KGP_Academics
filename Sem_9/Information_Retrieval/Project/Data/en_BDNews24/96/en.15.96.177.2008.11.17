 MOSCOW, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian liberals launched a pro-Kremlin political party on Sunday promising to defend middle class values but rivals said it was just a tool for the authorities to suck support away from genuine opposition groups. At a meeting in a Moscow hotel leaders of the Right Cause party said they aimed to win seats at Russia's parliamentary election in 2011 under the slogan: "Freedom, property, order."

"This party is needed (by the Kremlin) to fill a black hole on the right wing of the political spectrum," he said. The Right Cause is an amalgamation of the opposition Union of Right Forces (SPS) with the broadly pro-Kremlin Democratic Party and Civic Force. The SPS -- set up by pro-Western reformers -- won no seats in last year's parliamentary election and did not field a candidate in the presidential election this year. Earlier this month the SPS said it was joining the pro-Kremlin alliance because that was the only way it could survive but opponents accused the SPS of selling out.
