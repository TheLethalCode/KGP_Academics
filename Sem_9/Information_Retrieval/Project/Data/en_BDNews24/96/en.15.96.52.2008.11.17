<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com) Bangladesh has reached an understanding with the US to install radiation detector equipment in Chittagong port for curbing possible shipment of nuclear materials, says a press release. "The United States National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) announced today that it has signed a memorandum of understanding to partner with Bangladesh's ministry of shipping and other government agencies to install radiation detection equipment and associated infrastructure at the port of Chittagong," said the statement issued by the local American Centre Monday. "Considering Bangladesh's strategic South Asian location, this agreement is a major step forward in preventing nuclear materials from being smuggled through maritime cargo container traffic," the statement quoted the NNSA deputy administrator for Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation William Tobey as saying. "The NNSA appreciates Bangladesh's willingness to cooperate with us in this critical mission and we look forward to continuing our joint efforts", he said. The work was part of the megaports initiative aiming to strengthen the capability of foreign governments to deter, detect, and interdict illicit trafficking in nuclear and other radioactive materials across international borders and through the global maritime shipping system, it said. The NNSA maintains and enhances the safety, security, reliability and performance of the US nuclear weapons stockpile without nuclear testing. It also works to reduce global danger from weapons of mass destruction and provides the US Navy with safe and effective nuclear propulsion, said the statement. The NNSA responds to nuclear and radiological emergencies in the United States and abroad, it said. bdn
