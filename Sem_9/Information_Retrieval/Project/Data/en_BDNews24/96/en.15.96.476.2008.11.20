 Dhaka, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com)  Election Commissioner M Sakhawat Hussain has said that the comments of Washington-based election observation group National Democratic Institute about the election process in Bangladesh are 'unacceptable.' No foreign organisation has the right to comment on the internal affairs of a sovereign state, Sakhawat said on Thursday at his office. He asked the organisation to maintain 'courtesy'. The NDI suggested on Wednesday the government maintained dialogue with the political parties and should not deploy police or army to avoid scaring the people. Sam Gejenson, a member of NDI, said at a press briefing it would be a big step in restoring democracy to Bangladesh if a neutral election was held with the participation of all parties. The NDI recommended that the Election Commission assess electoral expenditure of candidates, approve local electoral guidelines, re-evaluate the ban on the usage of mobile phones and ensure alternatives, supply printed and digitised voter lists and ensure proper voting atmosphere for the minorities. "The organisation has come as an observer; it cannot make any comment on policy matters," said Sakhawat said. The comments on the internal security of the country were not welcome from either diplomats or foreign organisations, he added. "This is a matter that will be decided by the political parties and the people," Sakhawat asserted. bd
