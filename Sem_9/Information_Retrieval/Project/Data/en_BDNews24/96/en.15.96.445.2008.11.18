 Dhaka, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com)  Leaders of the two major parties have hinted that the Dec. 18 vote could be deferred by some days as part of an apparent consensus reached in talks with advisers Tuesday night. The new date, Dec 28, an idea considered after the BNP demand for a delayed polls, received backing from all quarters including Dhaka's influential diplomatic community, it emerged late Tuesday night. US ambassador James F Moriarty earlier in the day said the polls could be shifted if the parties and the interim government reached an accord. The government is running against time to break a broader ground to get the the arch political foes to run the general election by year-end. International observers, mostly from Western countries, were opposed to the idea of traveling to and monitoring polls in a foreign country during the Christmas vacation. Five advisers met with Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina late Tuesday night after concluding talks with her BNP counterpart Khaleda Zia, though little was revealed by any side about the outcomes of the meetings. "The government has proposed to defer the election to Dec. 28. We have no objection if there is a change in schedule by a day or two in the interest of holding the election," said Rashed Khan Menon, one of the 14-party leaders who attended the Sudha Sadan meeting with the advisers. The meeting began as the five advisers reached Hasina's Sudha Sadan home in Dhanmondi at around 10:00pm. It ended 45 minutes later. Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman, emerging from the meeting, said only: "We discussed how to overcome the hurdles to election." AL joint general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam said: "The meeting discussed how to make the election free and fair." Neither side were any more forthcoming. None replied to a question from reporters on whether the election might be deferred. Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury, communications adviser Ghulam Quader, law adviser AF Hassan Ariff, local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal and Hossain Zillur went directly to Hasina's residence from Khaleda's Gulshan office. AL leaders including presidium members Amir Hossain Amu, Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, Abdur Razzaq, Tofail Ahmed, Suranjit Sengupta were also present at Sudha Sadan. Among others were AL-led alliance leaders including Workers' Party president Rashed Khan Menon and Jatiya Party acting president Barrister Anisul Islam Mahmud. The government acted swiftly Tuesday in the wake of the four-party's ultimatum issued by Khaleda on Monday, which included rescheduling of the general election. Awami League and its allies had been saying until the night that they were averse to any shift in the election date. The chief adviser held a meeting with the chief election commissioner earlier in the day, after which the five advisers sat with Khaleda from around 6:45 to 8:15pm to discuss the four-party's four conditions for joining the general election. The BNP-led four-party alliance gave the government 48 hours on Monday to meet the four conditions on which they would take part in the general election. Election Commission officials said that CEC ATM Shamsul Huda met with Fakhruddin Ahmed Tuesday to discuss with the interim government head whether the polls could be rescheduled. BNP and its allies have called for total withdrawal of the state of emergency and re-announcement of the election schedule for the sake of pilgrims who are now in Saudi Arabia to perform hajj. Changes to section 91E of the Representation of the People Ordinance 2008 that gives the Election Commission power to cancel candidacy, and deferment of Upazila polls are the other two demands. bdnews24.
