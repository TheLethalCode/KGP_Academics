 KATHMANDU, Wed Nov 19, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nepal's Maoist-led government must end the widespread torture and ill-treatment of children in police custody and punish those found guilty of abuses, Human Rights Watch said on Wednesday.

"Instead, by torturing children in custody they are committing crimes against those they are supposed to be protecting." Police spokesman Binod Singh denied children were tortured now and said 187 police personnel including officers had been punished for past abuses in the last two years. "We have launched an awareness programme to educate the force about protecting human rights and no one is tortured now," Singh said. Human Rights Watch said it received "credible" claims of more than 200 cases of torture or abuse committed by members of the Nepali police against boys and girls, some as young as 13. Most children abused by the police were suspected of committing petty crimes, or were children living or working on the streets, it said, adding sometimes children were tortured to extract confessions.
