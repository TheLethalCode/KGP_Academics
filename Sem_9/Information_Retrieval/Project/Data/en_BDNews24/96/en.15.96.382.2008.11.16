<TITLE> EU proposes penalties to combat illegal fishing </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BRUSSELS, Nov 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Europe's fisheries chief proposed new regulations on Friday to crack down on illegal fishing, which is depleting fish stock, by using a penalty point system similar to that for driving offences. European Union Fisheries Commissioner Joe Borg, who has often complained existing controls are inadequate, proposed toughening up rules on inspections, monitoring and traceability requirements for the fishing industry. Many species of fish in European waters, especially cod, haddock and hake, been severely depleted by years of overfishing and some are at risk of disappearing entirely. Under the new points system, if a certain number of offences are racked up over three years -- for example, if trawlers use small-mesh nets to trap extra fish -- holders of fishing permits will lose their right to fish, after suspensions of six and then 12 months. "Control and enforcement of catch limits should be the cornerstone of the Common Fisheries Policy. Instead, it is our Achilles heel," Borg said in a statement. Despite spending 400 million euros ($500 million) a year on fishing controls, the union still has unreliable data on fish catches, the EU Commission has said. Fisheries ministers from all 27 member states have yet to agree to the new measures. The points system would apply to the fishing vessel, and to the crew's master and officers. Offences would be collated in a points register in the ship's home country. The new rules would govern EU vessels even if they fish outside European waters. They would also cover non-EU vessels within the European Union. However, any existing bilateral arrangements would take precedence. Borg also proposed making it compulsory for EU countries to inspect fish landings, processing, transport and marketing, as well as to monitor criteria such as a vessel's fishing capacity and its engine power. If a country breaks the rules, its EU subsidies could be cut or suspended, annual catch quotas reduced and even fishing forbidden in its waters, Borg said. Under Borg's proposal, EU inspectors could check vessels outside their national waters, and officials from one country could inspect the ships of another. Under current rules, each country may only inspect its own fishing fleet.
