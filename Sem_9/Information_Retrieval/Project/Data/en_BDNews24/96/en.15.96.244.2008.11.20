<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission voiced satisfaction on Thursday over BNP's announcement on being ready for Dec 28 polls, calling the apparent compromise "fair progress". Election commissioner Muhammed Sohul Hussain, in an immediate reaction to BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's televised statement, said: "It is fair progress in the process to facilitate the election." "We will have to sit tomorrow (Friday) before we can give a decision," he told bdnews24.com. On a possible decision to defer polls, Sohul said it still depended on probable political consensus between the government and political parties. "Many things can be done if it is necessary for the sake of free and fair election, but due to legal obligation the polls must be held within December." Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda on Wednesday had said the EC was ready to reschedule parliamentary polls for Dec 28 on a given political consensus. According to the existing schedule, the general election is set for Dec. 18 and local government (upazila) elections on Dec. 28. Earlier on Thursday, after 2 days of negotiation between the government, parties and election officials, the EC gave a fresh set of dates for nominations and withdrawal of candidacies "considering the requirement of prospective nominees". It was the second rescheduling, keeping the dates of the Jatiya Sangsad and Upazila polls the same, since the original schedule was announced in early November. bdnews2
