 Dhaka, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com)  After a two-week break because of the national team's involvement in the Grand Royal Challenge Cup in Myanmar, the Citycell B. League will resume on Nov 24 (Monday) with a classy derby between archrivals Abahani Limited and Mohammedan Sporting Club. The match will start at 4:30pm at Bangabandhu National Stadium. Holders Abahani are on the top of 11-team table with 15 points from five straight wins in six matches, four points ahead of fourth-placed Dhaka Mohammedan, who, however, played a match less than the Sky-Blues outfit. Following the day on Nov 25, another high-voltage match will take place at the same venue with second-placed Sheikh Russel KC (14 points from seven matches) facing title contenders Brothers Union (10 points from six matches). The Bangladesh Football Federation had earlier suspended some B. League matches of Abahani, Mohammedan and Brothers during the Mardeka Cup in Malaysia last month because of the players' involvement in trio clubs in the national team. The suspension of matches caused a bit disparity in the fixture with the giants playing less matches than the minnows. To adjust the difference, the B. League committee on Tuesday declared tight schedules for the giants. bd
