 Bloemfontein, South Africa, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa face Bangladesh on Wednesday with one eye on the rear view mirror as a critical test series with Australia approaches. The International Cricket Council's third-ranked team will field their full-strength lineup in two tests against last-placed Bangladesh as a final warm-up before a daunting three-test series in Australia starting on Dec. 17. Bangladesh, already suffering defections to the unofficial Indian Cricket League, will have to replace left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak, who returns from Australia, where he had tests on an illegal bowling action, late on Tuesday. Leading pace bowler Mashrafee Mortaza is also doubtful after suffering a back strain and left-arm seamer Syed Rasel has returned home with a similar complaint. Bangladesh captain Mohammad Ashraful said his batsmen had used the second one-day international against South Africa in Benoni 10 days ago to work on their technique against the feared fast bowling duo of Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel. South Africa captain Graeme Smith said he was looking for his side to produce top-class cricket no matter the standard of the opposition they will face in Bloemfontein. "The six days before the first test in Australia are still going to be the most crucial in terms of preparation, but I would like to see us having real control against Bangladesh and playing in the sort of style we want to against Australia. "We want to see progression in the series against Bangladesh, that we are getting better and better," Smith told a news conference in Bloemfontein on Tuesday, on the eve of the first of the two tests. South Africa won the limited-overs series 2-0, the third one-dayer being washed out, and triumphed in Benoni by 128 runs. "South Africa made too many runs (358) and after we lost four wickets we just decided to bat out the 50 overs and make sure Steyn and Morkel each had to bowl 10, which gave us a lot of experience against them," said Ashraful. "We just want to focus on our areas and what we can improve. Everyone has good talent in this team and we feel confident." Makhaya Ntini, dropped from South Africa's limited-overs team, returns to join Steyn, Morkel and Jacques Kallis in a powerful pace bowling attack. Smith said they would aim to tear through a Bangladesh batting lineup that has never scored more than 259 in a test innings against the Proteas, ahead of the stiffer challenge against Australia. "Morne and Dale are wicket-takers, aggressive bowlers, while Makhaya's experience with the ball will be crucial," said Smith. "While it's hard to re-enact the battle-hardened, cutting edge you get against the best in the world, we need to concentrate on our disciplines and it's always important that you never give Bangladesh a sniff," he added. Wednesday's test will be South Africa's fourth in Bloemfontein, where they have never lost. Bangladesh: Mohammad Ashraful, Mashrafee Mortaza, Imrul Kayes, Junaid Siddique, Mahbubul Alam, Mehrab Hossain, Mushfiqur Rahim, Naeem Islam, Nazmul Hossain, Shahadat Hossain, Shakib al-Hasan and Tamim Iqbal. South Africa: Graeme Smith, Ashwell Prince, Hashim Amla, Mark Boucher, AB de Villiers, JP Duminy, Paul Harris, Jacques Kallis, Neil McKenzie, Morne Morkel, Makhaya Ntini, Dale Steyn and Monde Zondeki.
