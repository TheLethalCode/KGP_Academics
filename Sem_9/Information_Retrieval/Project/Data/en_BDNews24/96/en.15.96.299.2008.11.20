 KANPUR, India, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India claimed a 16-run win over England under the Duckworth-Lewis method in a weather-hit third one-dayer on Thursday, taking a 3-0 lead in the seven-match series. India, chasing England's 240 all out, were 198 for five after 40 overs when poor light forced the players off the field to abruptly end what was developing into a keen finish. The hosts were 16 runs ahead under the Duckworth-Lewis method for weather-interrupted games and were declared winners in hazy conditions. Poor light had forced a 45-minute delay in the morning and forced the game to be reduced to 49 overs per side. Opening batsman Virender Sehwag top-scored with 68 to lead the chase against England, who put up a vastly improved display after losing the first two games by 158 runs and 54 runs respectively. All rounder Andrew Flintoff, who scored 26, grabbed the key wickets of openers Gautam Gambhir (14), Sehwag and the in-form Yuvraj Singh (38), who hit back-to-back match-winning hundreds in the first two games. However, skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni (29 not out) and Yusuf Pathan (12) hung on to make sure India held wickets in hand which kept them ahead when the poor light forced the teams off the field. All rounder Ravi Bopara top-scored with 60 as makeshift opener and raised 79 runs with Ian Bell (46) to lift a shaky England before they were all out with two balls left. England reshuffled the batting to no great effect until Owais Shah (40), Flintoff and Samit Patel (26) made the eventual score possible. Indian off spinner Harbhajan Singh claimed three for 31. The fourth game will be played in Bangalore on Sunday
