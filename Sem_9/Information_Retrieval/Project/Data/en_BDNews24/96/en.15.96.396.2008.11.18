 Dhaka, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com)  The Securities and Exchange Commission has raised the ceiling of merchant banks' margin loan ratio from 1:1 to 1:1.5, an official said on Tuesday. Margin loans are given by merchant banks for trading purposes to the stock market traders against the shares traders hold. The decision came from an SEC board meeting earlier in the day. SEC executive director Farhad Ahmed told newsmen the stock market regulator hoped the decision would ease the liquidity crisis. "Merchant bankers proposed a raise in the ratio in a meeting with Securities and Exchange Commission," he added. Ahmed also said they were considering an increase in the number of merchant banks and allowing non-bank financial institutions (NBFI) to expose more than five times their equity. The SEC has also approved floating of Prime Finance 1st Mutual Fund worth Tk 20 crore. "The Prime Finance and Investment Ltd. is the sponsor of the mutual find while the Investment Corporation of Bangladesh (ICB) is the issuer," said Ahmed. Tuesday's meeting also approved three companies' right shares issuance. Eastern Bank Limited has been approved to issue one right share against two shares while National Polymer would be issuing two right shares against one, he said. "Social Investment Bank is permitted to issue right shares at 1:1 ratio that is one right share against one existing," he added. bd
