<TITLE> South Africa to withhold Zimbabwe aid over deadlock </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 HARARE, Thu Nov 20, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa said on Thursday it will withhold aid for Zimbabwe until a representative government is in place, in what appeared to be the first punitive measure by a regional country to enforce a power-sharing agreement. The South African government also said it was "extremely concerned" about Zimbabwe's political impasse which has deepened a humanitarian crisis. The tough statement came as President Robert Mugabe's ruling ZANU-PF and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) prepared to hold another round of talks in South Africa next week to seek a breakthrough while political tensions are rising. Mugabe is trying to push through a constitutional amendment allowing him to name a cabinet, a move that could lead to the unraveling of a deadlocked September 15 power-sharing agreement with the opposition. The MDC has refused to enter the government, accusing Mugabe of trying to control most of the powerful ministries. The deal had raised hopes that a new leadership would get on with the task of rescuing the ruined economy. But the power struggle between Mugabe and old foe MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai has overshadowed daily hardships including chronic food and fuel shortages that have driven millions of Zimbabweans out of the country and strained regional economies
