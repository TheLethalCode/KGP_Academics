<TEXT>
 BELGRADE, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Aston Villa striker Savo Milosevic scored two goals and missed two penalties in his last international appearance as Serbia demolished neighbours Bulgaria 6-1 in a friendly on Wednesday. The 35-year old stalwart took his tally to 37 goals in 102 games for his country and received a standing ovation when he was substituted in the 34th minute of what may have been the penultimate match of his career. "I have one more league match for my (Russian) club Rubin Kazan and that might be the end," he told reporters after the match. "But it was a great way to hang up my international boots, I enjoyed playing with these lads who were always two gears ahead of me tonight and I think they have a great future. "The emotions got the better of me when I took the penalties as my concentration dropped but I was delighted to go out with a brace, this match kind of summed up my entire career which has been full of ups and downs. "I have no regrets, every player has to end his career at some point and when I look back at mine I will be able to say that I have really enjoyed it." It was Milosevic's first and final game for Serbia as all his previous international appearances came for the former Yugoslavia and its rump successor Serbia and Montenegro. He had not played for his country since the 2006 World Cup, where he had a poor tournament which Serbia and Montenegro exited in the first round after three group defeats. Milosevic, who won two league titles with Partizan Belgrade and the English League Cup with Aston Villa, scored five goals for Yugoslavia in Euro 2000 to finish as the tournament's joint top scorer along with Patrick Kluivert of the Netherlands. He also enjoyed a successful spell with several Spanish first division clubs before scoring the winning goal that handed Rubin their first Russian league title with three games to spare earlier this month. Milan Jovanovic fired Serbia ahead on Wednesday either side of Milosevic's failed spot kicks before Blagoy Georgiev equalised with a superb free kick. Serbia then ran riot as Jovanovic struck again and Milosevic turned in a pair of Milos Krasic crosses to make it 4-1 by halftime, with Nenad Milijas and Danko Lazovic completing the rout in the second half
