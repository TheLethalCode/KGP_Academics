 Dhaka, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Party has joined the Awami league-led electoral alliance after a meeting between JP chairman Hussain Muhammad Ershad and Awami League president Sheikh Hasina on Tuesday. "We have decided to go to the polls together and form a unity government if we win," Ershad said to reporters after the meeting that started at around 2:30pm at Hasina's Dhanmondi home. Jatiya Party was a component of the AL-led 'grand alliance' forged for the forestalled general election in 2007. Ershad, however, did not comment about distribution of electoral seats or the possibility of his becoming president if the alliance went to power. "But for the cancelled 2007 elections I had such an understanding in writing with Awami League," the former president said. He also said if the election did not take place on Dec. 18, the chances of the election taking place in the future would shrink. "It will be better if all parties participate." "We will go to polls and form a government together because we made such an agreement before 1/11," said Syed Ashraful Islam, the AL spokesman. The Worker's Party of Bangladesh that is part of the alliance has misgivings about taking JP in the alliance. Acting JP chairman Anisul Islam Mahmud said until Tuesday no list of seats were provided by the JP. "Awami League will make the decision as to who will be in the alliance." Ershad was accompanied by Mahmud, party secretary general Ruhul Amin Hawlader and presidium members Kazi Zafar Ahmed and Ziauddin Bablu. Earlier, AL presidium members Amir Hossain Amu, Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed, Suranjit Sengupta, general secretary Abdul Jalil and party spokesperson and joint secretary Syed Ashraful Islam arrived at Sudha Sadan. bdnews24
