<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com)  The BNP led four-party alliance said Thursday that "the door for discussion was still open". The alliance would clarify their stance about the elections after a meeting on Thursday evening, BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain told reporters at his NAM Flat. "The four-party wants to go to elections; we feel the door for discussion is open yet." Asked point-blank whether they would join the Dec 18 national polls, Delwar said: "It is not acceptable that the government has again announced the election date without completing discussions with us." "We want to go to elections within a rational time. Dec 28 or January should not be an issue here," he said. "We have to be given sufficient time for preparation." Delwar asked: "If the Election Commission has changed the deadline for submission of nomination papers, why has the election date not been deferred?" On another of their four demands, he said: "The state of emergency has not been lifted yet. The government must say when it will lift emergency." Delwar spoke to reporters after a gathering at his home to mark the 44th birthday of Tarique Rahman, elder son of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia. Former BNP senior joint secretary general, Tarique is now in the UK, with his family, undergoing medical treatment. He flew to London on Sept 11 after securing bail in a raft of corruption cases against him. bdnew
