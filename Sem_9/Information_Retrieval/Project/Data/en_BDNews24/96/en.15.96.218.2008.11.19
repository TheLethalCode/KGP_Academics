 Dhaka, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com)  League leaders Barisal were just three wickets away from their third win in the National Cricket League at close of third day's play at Shaheed Chandhu Stadium on Wednesday. Rajshahi were crawling to 48 for seven at stumps after Barisal set them to chase 257 to win the match. Rajshahi lost three top order batsmen  openers Mahbub Alam, Jahurul Islam and Khaled Mashud  inside two overs without putting any run on the board, and never came back from the early damage as pace duo Kamrul Islam and Talhat Jubair shared three wickets. One-down Farhad Hossain played a painstaking 22 off 60 before spinner Tariqul Islam wrecked the middle to return three for 14. Suhrawardi Shuvo remained unbeaten on 12 when umpires broke the bails after the seventh wicket fall. Earlier, Barisal having resumed the day on 177 for three added another 165 runs as Hannan Sarkar and Nasir Hossain put on 122 runs for the fourth wicket stand. Hannan, on overnight total of 64, was just one run short of century before being trapped leg before Farhad Hossian. The national discard, who made 77 in the first innings, hammered 11 fours and one six in his 149-ball knock. Nasir converted his overnight 24 to 92 before also being the victim of Farhad, who returned four for 33, but the spinner could not stop Barisal from posting a big total. The middle order batsman struck eight fours in 218 balls before Suhrawardi cleaned up the tail taking four wickets for 119. Dhaka vs Chittagong The match between Dhaka and Chittagong was seemingly heading for a draw at Birsreshthha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium in Chittagong with the hosts taking overall lead of 73 runs on the third day. Chittagong were 125 for two at stumps in the second innings after visitors Dhaka posted a big total of 366 in reply to hosts' first innings total of 314. Opener Gazi Salahuddin fell to Emon Ahmed for eight, but Nafis Iqbal and Rezaul Karim steadied the innings adding 115 runs for the second wicket before Karim was run out by Samsul for 59 off 66 balls that included eight fours and two sixes. Nafis remained unbeaten on 52 when the bails were drawn for the day. Earlier, Dhaka resumed the day on 157 for three and added another 209 runs as Marshal Ayub converted his overnight 58 to 181 off 293 balls studded with 25 fours and one six. Marshal along with Nadif Chowdhury put on 117 runs for the sixth wicket before the latter was trapped lbw by Mohammad Younus for 41. With the dismissal of Marshal, Dhaka slipped to 365 allout from 347 for six as Tareq Aziz raised his tally to four for 61. Younus grabbed three for 110. Sylhet vs Khulna Holders Khulna were close to taking the first innings lead against Sylhet at close of the second day's play at Sylhet Cricket Stadium. Shahagir Hossain struck a fine 105 as Khulna were 250 for five at stumps in the first innings after bowling the hosts out for 300 in the morning. Amit Majumder and Shahagir gave Khulna a solid start contributing 97 runs for the opening stand before Monir Hossain separated the openers removing Amit for 34. The Khulna wicketkeeper hardly got any support from other end, but completed his hundred striking 18 fours and one six in 159 balls. Raihan Anas (21) and Mohammad Selim (18) resume the third day Thursday. bd
