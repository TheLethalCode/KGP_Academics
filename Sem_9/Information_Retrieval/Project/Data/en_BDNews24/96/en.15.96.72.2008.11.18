 Dhaka, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com)  The government is considering the four demands BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia on Monday asked it to meet in 48 hours for the four-party alliance to take part in the upcoming polls. Adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman on Tuesday called the BNP's conditional stance towards election participation "positive". "The nation is now relieved that BNP will participate in the election, despite their press for the fulfilment of certain conditions." He added that the government would discuss the conditions and give a decision "in time". "The main aim of the government is the participation of all parties and, for that end, all initiatives will be taken," he said. Hossain Zillur also said the time limit specified by BNP was not the main concern but with the right approach and "a view to solve the complications" all problems could be settled. On the issue of changing the electoral schedule, he repeated the government would make a decision after discussion. The adviser made the comments after the inauguration of a workshop for autistic children at the RAOWA Club in Mohakhali on Tuesday. bdnews24.com
