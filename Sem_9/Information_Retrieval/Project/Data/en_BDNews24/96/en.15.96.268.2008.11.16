<TITLE> SCBA cold-shoulders new HC judges </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 16 (bdnews24.com)  In a break with tradition, the Supreme Court Bar Association did not accord reception to the six new High Court judges who took oath on Sunday on allegations of nepotism. "There was partiality in the appointment of the new judges," SCBA president barrister Shafik Ahmed said. Chief justice MM Ruhul Amin administered the oath to the new judges at the Supreme Court Judges' Lounge. But another judge, Kamal Ul Alam, skipped the swearing-in ceremony. The judges who were sworn in are Md Delwar Hossain, Sayeda Afsar Jahan, Abdul Hakim, Borhanuddin, Kamal Ul Alam, Md Abdus Samad and Azizul Hoque. Alam had informed the chief justice earlier that he would not be able to discharge his duty on personal and health grounds. Attorney general Salauddin Ahmed received the new judges after they had taken their oath. The appointment had not been done in line with the list sent by the Supreme Judicial Commission, barrister Shafik, the SCBA president, said at press briefing. The appointment followed the chief adviser's approval and recommendation of the law ministry, Shafik said. He said Md Delwar Hossain, Sayeda Afsar Jahan and Borhanuddin were junior to the law adviser and yet they had been appointed. "So the appointment lacks transparency," barrister Shafik said. Authorities took punitive measures against one of the new judges in the district judge's quota, he said. "We requested the chief justice in the morning not to swear him in," he said. President Iajuddin Ahmed appointed the seven additional judges in line with section 98 of the constitution. bdne
