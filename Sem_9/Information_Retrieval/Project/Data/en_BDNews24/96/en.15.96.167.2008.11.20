<TEXT>
 AMSTERDAM, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Robin van Persie netted twice to steer Netherlands to a 3-1 victory over Sweden in a friendly on Wednesday. The Dutch dominated the first half and took the lead when the Arsenal forward headed in a cross from Wesley Sneijder after 32 minutes. Van Persie made it 2-0 early in the second half following more good work by Sneijder and Rafael van der Vaart. Sweden pulled one back on a rare attack when Kim Kallstrom scored from the edge of the penalty area in the 49th minute. Dirk Kuyt added a third goal for the hosts in stoppage time when he nodded in a centre by Tim de Cler. "It was a useful match against opponents that play with two lines of four players close to each other, which demanded concentration and pace from my team," Dutch coach Bert van Marwijk told reporters. "They waited for our mistakes and if you give away one real chance and create several you have done well." Netherlands resume their World Cup qualifying campaign on March 28 when they host Scotland, the same day as Sweden visit Portugal
