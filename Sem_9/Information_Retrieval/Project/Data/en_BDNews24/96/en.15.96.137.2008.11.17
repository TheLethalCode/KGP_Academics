<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com) Shahidur Rahman Santu, former national goalkeeper, is all set to be appointed technical director of the Bangladesh Football Federation. "He (Santu) has already been given the appointment, but we will let you know it officially within a couple of days," said BFF president Kazi Salahuddin on Monday. Salahuddin said that Santu knows enough about Bangladesh football and that would help him assess the present condition of the game and help him consider steps that should be taken for its overall development. "Initially, he will be given a one year time frame." said the BFF boss. Santu, who lives in the United State of America, leaves Dhaka for Dinajpur on Tuesday to see the U-16 football camp. The BFF was supposed to appoint a foreign director, but it backtracked due to a huge expenditure. "It will take some $ 12,000 per month if we appoint a foreign director, but I think it would not be justified to spend such a huge amount of money at the moment," said Salahuddin, adding that he would consider it later. The former striker also said that the BFF would appoint a foreign coach for the national team three to four months before the South Asian Games, to be held in December 2009 in Bangladesh. bd
