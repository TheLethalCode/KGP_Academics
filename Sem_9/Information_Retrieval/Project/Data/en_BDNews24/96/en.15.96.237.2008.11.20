 BUENOS AIRES, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mexico stumbled into the final stage of the CONCACAF zone World Cup qualifiers on goal difference on Wednesday despite losing 1-0 to Honduras and having two players sent off. Honduras also went through while Trinidad and Tobago beat Cuba 3-0 to complete the six-team line up for the contest which will be played next year in a single group. The United States, Costa Rica and El Salvador had previously booked their places. Honduras topped Group Two with 12 points followed by Mexico and Jamaica on 10 each. Mexico sneaked through on goal difference despite Jamaica's 3-0 win over Canada in Kingston. Mexico, who lost in Jamaica and drew in Canada, continued their dismal away form under Swedish coach Sven Goran-Eriksson as they were sunk by a Ricardo Osorio own goal on a muddy pitch in San Pedro Sula. Osorio's attempted clearance went in off the crossbar following a corner in the 52nd minute. Mexico's frustration boiled over the last five minutes when Gerardo Torrado and Carlos Vela were sent off. Torrado picked up a second yellow card for a tackle on Carlos Costly in the 87th minute and Arsenal striker Vela was given a straight red one minute later for kicking Ramon Nunez. Jamaica, needing a large win to go through, gave it their best shot as Luton Shelton put them ahead in the 27th minute. Marlon King added the second with a 58th minute penalty and Omar Cummings completed the scoring with four minutes left as Jamaica maintained their 100 percent home record in the group. Former Manchester United striker Dwight Yorke was among the scorers as Trinidad beat eliminated Cuba 3-0 in Port of Spain to take second spot in Group One behind the U.S. Kenwyne Jones and Keon Daniel were also on target for the Soca Warriors who are coached by Colombia's Francisco Maturana. The U.S. finished top of the group when second half goals from Kenny Cooper and Freddy Adu gave them a 2-0 win over Guatemala in Denver. Costa Rica completed Group Three with a 100 percent record by beating El Salvador 3-1 away, helped by two goals from Roy Myrie and one from Jose Fernandez. Rudi Corrales had given El Salvador a 17th minute lead
