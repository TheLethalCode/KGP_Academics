<TITLE> Saudi prince wants faster political, economic reform </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia, Wed Nov 19, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Detained advocates of political reforms in Saudi Arabia should face trial or be released and the government should move faster on social and economic reform, a senior prince said. King Abdullah has tried to open the once-closed desert country up since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks increased Western criticism of the Islamic state, where the royal family rules in alliance with puritanical clerics. Fifteen 15 of the 19 al Qaeda attackers were Saudi. Prince Talal bin Abdul-Aziz, a son of the kingdom's founder, led an abortive attempt to transform the country into a democratic state in the 1960s. In recent years he has expressed support for the reforms enacted by the king, his half-brother. "There are some measures that are moving at a slow pace and they must be speeded up," he told Reuters in an interview late on Tuesday on the sidelines of an event to promote an aid organisation he heads. "(The king) has made good efforts with regards to the social issues that relate to medicine, education and services. There are some accomplishments but more of these efforts are needed to to complete the picture." Abdullah oversaw Saudi Arabia's accession to the World Trade Organisation in 2005 and has launched ambitious development projects including four "economic cities" to provide jobs and modern education in a less restricted social environment. Diplomats say he has faced opposition from the powerful religious establishment who fear the reforms aim to dilute their tight control over society through mosques, Islamic law courts, the education system and a morality police force. Diplomats also say the key princes in the royal family -- who control the most important government ministries -- are split between a liberal wing that supports the king and conservatives who fear angering the clerics. Prince Talal, father of billionaire businessman Prince Alwaleed, said the king's "calm" approach had won over some royals. "Regarding the political agenda, King Abdullah has made some efforts ... and some (efforts) are being accepted by the same individuals who objected to them in the past," he said, in an apparent reference to other key members of the royal family. The Interior Ministry has detained thousands of suspects since 2003 on suspicion of links to al Qaeda militants, but dozens of pro-democracy reformers have also been seized in a revolving door of detention and release. In May, politics professor Matruk al-Faleh was taken from his offices at King Saud University in Riyadh and nine reform activists remain in solitary confinement after they were seized in 2007 on suspicion of "financing terrorism". "The idea of arresting and jailing someone without a trial is unacceptable in our religion or by law," Prince Talal said when asked about the Saudi political detainees. "What we request from all Arab countries is not to put innocent people in jail. They must be tried in a just and independent trial." Saudi Arabia, a key US ally and the world's largest oil exporter, has no parties or elected parliament and street protests are banned. The prince said he still hoped the reforms would lead to political parties. "The political party (idea) is still on but when and how it will be applied has still not been decided," he said. "It depends on the situation in this region that surrounds us." Arab countries lacking democratic political systems often say regional tensions are not conducive to reform. Diplomats and Saudi analysts predict Saudi Islamists would benefit if the king were to allow elections to the Shura Assembly
