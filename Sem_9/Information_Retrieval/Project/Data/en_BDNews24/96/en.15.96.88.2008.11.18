 CAPE TOWN, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ashes-winning former England coach Duncan Fletcher returned to international cricket on Monday as a consultant to South Africa's head coach Mickey Arthur. Zimbabwe-born Fletcher has been unemployed since resigning from the England post last year after the 5-0 test thrashing in Australia which followed England's 2-1 series triumph in 2005. "Duncan will spend three days with us before each of the two Tests against Bangladesh and will then spend 12 days with us in Australia ahead of the opening Test at Perth," said Arthur in a statement. "He will add a great deal of value to our plans and preparations, particularly with his experience of having been a successful coach against Australia. "I am a great believer in refreshing the squad, whether it be on the playing or management side and he will help us find another five percent to take us up to the next level," said Arthur. Cricket South Africa chief executive, Gerald Majola, said the approach to employ Fletcher had come from Arthur and the rest of the management and coaching team. "This move was mooted by the team management and says much for their maturity and eagerness to use the best preparation methods available," Majola said
