 Rome, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com)  Agriculture adviser CS Karim has called for urgent global action to combat disastrous fallouts of climate change, high food and fertiliser prices that threaten food security, said a statement from Rome Wednesday. "Looking back, the disasters last year in Bangladesh are the manifestations of wake-up calls," he said, referring to the consequences of twin floods and devastating the Cyclone Sidr that wreaked havoc on Bangladesh within a span of three months last year. "Some of the changes in low-lying countries such as Bangladesh would have been irreversible. In that context inaction can not be an option for us. "Catastrophic climatic events like floods, cyclones, droughts would thwart our development initiatives," Karim said at the inaugural session of the 35th special session of the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation conference in the Italian capital. The conference was convened to enable the organisation to address the challenges of global food security more effectively and efficiently. The director general of FAO, Jacques Diouf, opened the conference. He reiterated in his inaugural speech that the reforms envisaged should match action plan without compromising the much-needed growth in agriculture worldwide. He called for a new FAO capable of meeting new challenges of sustainable food security to counter hunger and malnutrition. Karim expressed Bangladesh's commitment to the important works of FAO and its renewal process. He supported the reform process and highlighted the recent achievements of Bangladesh in increasing agriculture production to meet the challenges of food security. He mentioned the first-ever National Agriculture Day observation in Bangladesh to officially recognise the efforts of the farmers. He also underscored the need for continued resource flow into agriculture sector in the face of recent global financial crisis. Ministers from a large number of member countries are attending the Conference
