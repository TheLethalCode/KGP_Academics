 Dhaka, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com)  Two former caretaker government advisers have warned of "great disaster" if a free, fair and credible election does not take place with the participation of all parties in December. "The government has been pledging for two years that it will hold a free and fair election with the participation of all parties. But the present scenario seems that it cannot implement its pledge," former adviser Akbar Ali Khan said. "But, I think there is time yet," he added. "The government should hold a free and fair election by December 31 after completing discussions with the political parties in 24 to 48 hours," he said. Akbar Ali said the parties should play a responsible role . "If the election is not held by December 31 the country will face a great disaster," said Akbar Ali, the chairman of the Regulatory Reforms Commission. He urged the government and the parties to reach a consensus and make arrangements for holding elections. Another former adviser, economist Wahiduddin Mahmud said: "We are heading towards an uncertain goal. People have been expecting for the last two years that a free and fair election will be held with the participation of all parties." "But now it seems that one major party or alliance will not join the elections. It will not yield a good result for the country," he said. "There is time yet to hold discussions and stage elections where all parties will join," Wahiduddin said. The parties should also allow some compromise for the greater interest of the country, he added. The two ex-advisers made the remarks at the 'Citi Micro Entrepreneurs Award-2008', organised by Citi Foundation, an associated organisation of Citi Group, at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre. bdnews
