<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 16 (bdnews24.com)The first day of a two-day sea border meet with Myanmar ended Sunday in Dhaka, with additional foreign secretary MAK Mahmud reiterating that boundaries must be redrawn according to the UN laws of the sea. Mahmud told bdnews24.com after the talks ended on day one that Myanmar should not cross the 180 degree north-south line, according to which Bangladesh's sea border was defined in 1974. He stressed that the maritime boundaries must be drawn through negotiation and according to UNCLOS. Both Bangladesh and Myanmar are signatories to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea adopted in 1982. The two-day technical-level committee talks kicked off Sunday morning at the foreign ministry. Myanmar deputy minister Maung Myit heads an 11-member delegation while the additional foreign secretary is leading the Bangladesh delegates in the talks. Foreign secretary M Touhid Hossain, who was in Myanmar recently to resolve a maritime dispute, told bdnews24.com: "The deliberations are a follow-up of the talks already initiated by the two countries to resolve the confusions prevailing over their sea boundaries." The two nations met earlier this year in April to discuss maritime demarcation after a hiatus of 22 years. According to an agreement, both countries have committed to forego oil and gas exploration in disputed waters until the boundaries are drawn through negotiations in line with United Nations conventions. But tension flared between Bangladesh and its southwest neighbour earlier this month as Yangon began oil and gas exploration activities in the Bay of Bengal, some 60 nautical miles south of Saint Martin's Island, an area claimed by both countries. The dispute was resolved diplomatically after Dhaka sent letters of protest to Yangon and South Korean industrial giant Daewoo requesting them withdraw their installations in the Bay. bdnews2
