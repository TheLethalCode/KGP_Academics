 Dhaka, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com)  The city and municipality mayors cannot run for the parliament even after resigning their office, an Election Commission official said. According to the electoral laws, they will be eligible to contest three years from the date of their resignation, joint secretary at the Election Commission Secretariat Rafiqul Islam said Monday. According to the section 12 of the Representation of the People Order, anyone holding any 'office of profit' in the service of the republic or of a statutory public authority will be disqualified for running any other election. "Since the posts of mayors and councillors of city corporations and municipalities will be considered 'office of profit', they will not be eligible for any other elections until three years from their resignation or retirement from the service of the republic," Islam said, citing section 12. Chittagong mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury and Khulna mayor Sheikh Tayebur Rahman have already said they were running for the parliament. The mayors of four city corporations, all Awami League leaders, had to quit their party posts to be sworn into the office. The EC Secretariat will send directives to grassroots officers by Tuesday to clear any misunderstanding, Islam said. The local government authorities are going to amend the Local Government (Upazila Parishad) Ordinance to bar the same person from contesting in parliamentary and Upazila elections together. "The proposal of amendment has already been approved by the interim cabinet and sent to the law ministry for vetting," Md Nazibur Rahman, joint secretary at the local government ministry, said. Another official of the ministry requesting anonymity said the ministry had also proposed that no elected sitting people's representative can be a candidate in any other local government election. The amendment to the local government ordinance may be published by Tuesday, the ministry's deputy secretary, Upazila, Habibul Kabir Chowdhury said. bdnews
