 MADRID, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Villarreal striker Joseba Llorente has torn a thigh muscle and will be out of action for a month, the Primera Liga club said on Monday. The 28-year-old, who picked up the injury during Sunday's 2-2 draw in Malaga, is their top scorer with six in the league and three in Europe. He will miss the Champions League Group E top-of-the-table clash with Manchester United at home on Nov. 25, and will be a doubt for their final group match away to Celtic next month.
