 Dhaka, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com)  A scintillating century from Faisal Hossain Dickens kept Chittagong in commanding position against Dhaka on the first day of the sixth round four-dayer in the National Cricket League on Monday. Hosts Chittagong were 279 for eight at stumps against Dhaka with Tareq Aziz and Mohammad Younus batting on 11 and four respectively at Birshrestha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium in the port city. After deciding to bat first, Chittagong lost opener Gazi Salahuddin in the very first delivery, and Nafis Iqbal fell to Emon Ahmed for 14, leaving the side at 29 for two in 13.1 overs. One-down Masoom Ud Dowla pairing with Tareq Ahmed repaired the early damage adding 58 runs for the third wicket before Masoom was caught by Nazmul off Arafat Sunny for 32. Afterwards, Tareq and Faisal Hossain put on 128 for the fourth wicket to take the side to 210 for four before Tareq was out for 83 off 156 balls studded with nine fours and two sixes. Faisal struck 102 off 162 balls smashing four sixes and nine fours before pacer Ashraful Haque removed the left-handed batsman to reduce Chittagong to 253 for five, triggering a late-order slum. Away at Shaheed Chandhu Stadium in Bogra, Rajshahi dominated over Barisal after bowling them out for just 166 ,thanks to a three-wicket haul each from Shahajada and Suhrawardi Shuvo. Hannan Sarkar topscored with 77 followed by Nasir Hossain on 36 and Tariqul Islam on 18 not out. Pace duo Alamgir Kabir (2/29) and Shahajada (3/57) rattled the top order while Shuvo (3/25) and Sabbir Rahman (2/1) cleaned up Barisal's tail. Rajshahi, in reply, were 99 for two at stumps, still trailing by 70 runs in the first innings. Farhad Hossain (36) and Anisur Rahman (34) will resume the second day Tuesday. bd
