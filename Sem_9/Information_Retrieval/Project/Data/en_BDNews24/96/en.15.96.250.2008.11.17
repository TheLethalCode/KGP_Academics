 JERUSALEM, Mon Nov 17,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert promised Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas during talks on Monday to release 250 Palestinians prisoners next month, a spokesman for Olmert said. "The 250 prisoners will be released in advance of the upcoming Muslim holiday," said the spokesman, describing the move as a goodwill gesture toward Abbas, who revived peace talks with Israel after breaking with Hamas Islamist rivals last year. Muslims celebrate the al-Adha feast next month. The spokesman said the prisoners Israel plans to release would not be aligned with Islamist movements. Israel last freed Palestinian prisoners on August 25, during a visit by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who has been trying to broker a peace deal. At the time, it described the release of the 198 prisoners as a bid to bolster Abbas. Some 11,000 Palestinians are in Israeli prisons and securing their freedom is a highly emotive issue in Palestinian society, which regards them as symbols of resistance to occupation. "President Abbas asked Mr Olmert to sustain a comprehensive truce in Gaza and to release prisoners. Mr Olmert agreed to release 250 prisoners early next month," said Palestinian peace negotiator Saeb Erekat. A five-month-old, Egyptian-brokered truce between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip has been tested over the past two weeks by a surge of violence that has included Israeli raids and airstrikes in the territory and rocket attacks by militants
