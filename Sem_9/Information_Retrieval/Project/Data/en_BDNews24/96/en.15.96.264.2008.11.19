 Dhaka, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Olympic Association secretary general Kutubuddin Ahmed is allegedly trying to influence newly-elected Bangladesh Cricket Board directors to select Mahbub Anam as the senior vice president. Kutubuddin on Tuesday invited 10 board directors, who had recently been elected from districts and divisions, along with Yousuf Jamil Babu and Ashiqur Rahman Miku, leaders of the General Secretaries Association, to lunch at his office. He reportedly asked them to pick Anam as the senior vice president. He told them the BCB president had told him that he would like to see Anam in the post. Yousuf Jamil, the president of the association, admitted that they had been invited by the BOA secretary general, but refused to give details. Asked whether the BOA secretary general asked the board directors to vote for Anam, Jamil said, "Nothing has been finalised." Another director who attended the lunch told bdnews24com, asking he not be named, "The BOA secretary general asked us to vote for Mahbub Anam as the senior vice president of the board." "When some directors protested, he told us that the board president wanted him as the senior vice president," said the director. He said he later heard that the board president had no such desire. Kutubuddin did not receive nor did he return calls from bdnews24.com. A total of 23 directors, elected from three categories on Nov 12, will select a senior vice-president and two vice-presidents among them, with the president being chosen by the government. Besides, a director will be appointed by the National Sports Council, the sports governing body in the country. b
