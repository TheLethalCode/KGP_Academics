 Dhaka, Nov 17(bdnews24.com) Police will now identify polling centres as "important" and "normal", but none as "risky", ahead of general and upazila elections, said a senior police official on Monday. "The field level officials have been given instructions to mark the polling centres as normal and important and ordered to send in reports within this week," additional inspector general of police Nobo Bikram Kishore Tripura told bdnews24.com. Tripura spoke to bdnews24.co after a meeting of top police officials, on law and order for polls, held at police headquarters. Asked about the number of polling centres in the two categories, he said: "We will inform you after receiving reports." The meeting also focused on recovery of illegal arms, crackdown on terrorism, vigilance over movements of the contenders who failed to get nominations. Tripura said, referring to the chief adviser's comments earlier in the day, inspector general of police Nur Muhammad directed them to work impartially in the general and upazila polls. A police super, who was present in the meeting, told bdnews24.com: "The IGP directed the speed up of operations on arresting terrorists and recovering illegal arms with a view to making the parliamentary election violence-free." "The IG said there would be 'rewards and rebukes' to motivate the work," he added. He added that the inspector general instructed police units to get police assistance from neighbouring units if necessary during the elections. Nur Mohammad also directed police officials to take effective measures ahead of Victory Day and Eid-Ul-Ajha, the police super said. IGP, AIGs, DIGs and police commissioners from five metropolitan cities, deputy commissioners and SPs from all districts attended the meeting. bdne
