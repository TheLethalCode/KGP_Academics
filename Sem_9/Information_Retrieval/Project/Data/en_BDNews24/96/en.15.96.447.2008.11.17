<TEXT>
 Abu Dhabi, November 17 (bdnews24.com)- Pakistan completed a 3-0 one-day series whitewash over West Indies as a stellar display from Younus Khan guided them to a 31-run win in Abu Dhabi. Younus hit 101 before he was bowled by Nikita Miller with Misbah-ul-Haq adding 79 as Pakistan set a total of 273. Chris Gayle led the fightback with a battling 122 while Ramnaresh Sarwan (62) added 151 for the second wicket. But after Sarwan's dismissal, West Indies crumbled, losing their last eight wickets for 74 runs. Pakistan had endured wobbles of their own as they lost opener Salman Butt for a duck when he was caught by Daren Powell in the first over of the match. But Younus came to the crease and quickly set about building the home side's score alongside Khurrum Manzoor (30). The 30-year-old reached his sixth one-day hundred with a single off Powell, but just two balls later he attempted a reverse sweep off Miller and was bowled. Misbah continued his good work, adding a useful 40 for the sixth wicket with Kamran Akmal, who was bowled off the final delivery for 21. After Pakistan claimed victories in the opening two matches, the final tie in Abu Dhabi was a dead rubber, nonetheless West Indies skipper Gayle set about the business of chasing Pakistan's total. Sarwan ably supported Gayle before Rao Iftikhar Anjam broke their second-wicket stand when he trapped Sarwan in the 33rd over. Iftikhar ploughed through the West Indies, dismissing Shivnarine Chanderpaul (3) and Xavier Marshall (0) in the very next over, as he returned figures of 4-59. Gayle, who survived an edge to wicket-keeper Akmal on 99, was finally undone with six overs left when he caught behind off Umer Gul. The West Indies captain will now take his team to tour New Zealand while Pakistan prepare to host rivals India. Courtesy : B
