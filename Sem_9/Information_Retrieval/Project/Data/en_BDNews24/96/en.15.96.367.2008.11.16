 Dhaka, Nov 16 (bdnews24.com) - Awami League and BNP have submitted objections to the Election Commission against registration of over 20 agencies for monitoring the 9th Jatiya Sangsad elections slated for Dec. 18, said party leaders on Sunday. "AL has raised objections against 20 monitoring agencies, for reasons of party affiliation," AL assistant secretary Subhash Singha Rai told reporters. "We have demanded the EC debar those agencies from monitoring elections showing specific allegations against them," fellow AL assistant secretary Riazul Kabir said. The two spoke to the reporters after an AL delegation handed over a letter to EC secretary Mohammed Humayun Kabir. BNP's joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan told reporters at the EC Secretariat: "BNP has objected to the EC in a letter against four bodies." But he declined to name which bodies. EC official SM Asaduzzaman said Sunday: "A total of 319 agencies have applied to EC to monitor elections and of these, 138 agencies, after scrutiny, have been selected as monitoring bodies." "The agencies not passing scrutiny will soon be informed." The EC primarily published a list of 138 monitoring agencies on Nov 13 and invited objections up to Nov 16. The agencies against which AL has objected are BCDJC, Democracy Watch, FEMA, Jagarani Chakra, Khan Foundation, Light House, Noakhali Rural Development Society, Shariatpur Development Society, Srijony, Human Rights Commission of Bangladesh, AMUAB, Hilful Fujul Samaj Kalyan Sangstha, National Youth Forum Bangladesh, Jugayan Samajik Unnayan Sangstha, Unity of Social Advantage, BRAVE, Coast Trust, Development Organisation for The Poor, Nari Udyag Kendra, ANFREL. b
