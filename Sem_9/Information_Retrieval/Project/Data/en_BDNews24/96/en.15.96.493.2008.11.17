 Dhaka, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com)  Leaders of the associations of steel mills, re-rolling mills and ship-breakers have urged authorities to duty and VAT on imported rods to protect the local steel industry. The leaders also demanded reduction of import tax on chemical products used in the steel industry from seven to three percent, full removal of the 15 percent VAT, retaining tax on imported steel plates for the shipping industry and suspension of interest rates on bank loans for re-rolling mills. They threatened to besiege the National Board of Revenue if the demands were not fulfilled in the next 15 days. The general secretary of the Bangladesh Steel Mills Association, Mohammed Bashirullah, said at a press conference since India had withdrawn 15 percent tax on the export of rods, their production cost will go down and the local steel industry would be threatened. "To save this industry worth Tk 5000 crore, we demand 25 percent import tax instead of seven percent and 15 percent Value Added Tax (VAT) [on imported rods]," he said. He further said production cost in Bangladesh was higher than in India due to additional letter-of-credit fees, pre-shipment inspection charge, and high interests and freight rates. In India, the production cost is much lower as many of the charges do not exist and interest and freight rates are low, Bashirullah added. "Though India has a pro-industrialisation policy, our governments have always shown apathy." He also said the local industries were counting losses despite the fall in the price of melting scrap in international market because of the raw materials purchased earlier at a higher rate. "As the PSI agencies are not inspected regularly the melting scrap is often coming diluted with sand, earth and stones." bdne
