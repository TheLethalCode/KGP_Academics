 Dhaka, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com)  Football legend Diego Maradona will not be able to visit Bangladesh next month due to his tight schedule in neighbouring India, confirmed a top Bangladesh Football Federation official. "Three days ago, I talked to the agent that will bring Maradona to Kolkata. The agent confirmed that he would not have enough time to visit Bangladesh due to his tight schedule," BFF president Kazi Salahuddin told reporters at his office on Monday. Asked whether the BFF had the required funds, Salahuddin said that he was ready to welcome Maradona in Bangladesh whatever amount of money it took. The new Argentine coach is scheduled to visit Kolkata on Dec. 6 to lay the foundation stone of the Indian Football School, and take part in a charity dinner where some of his playing gear will be auctioned to raise funds. Maradona will land at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport on the Dec. 5 night. He is scheduled to leave India on the Dec.7.
