<TITLE> Terry atones to give England win over Germany </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BERLIN, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - John Terry atoned for his part in a dreadful mix-up to score a late header and give England a 2-1 win over old rivals Germany in an enterprising friendly on Wednesday. England moved ahead midway through the first half at the Olympiastadion when German goalkeeper Rene Adler missed an attempted punch from a corner, leaving defender Matthew Upson to prod the ball home. The visitors should have made it 2-0 when Darren Bent rounded substitute keeper Tim Wiese to be through on goal in the second half but the striker slipped and shot wide. Moments later the home side were level. Terry chose to shepherd the ball back toward England's replacement keeper Scott Carson, who hesitated and allowed Patrick Helmes to nip in and help himself to an equaliser. Captain Terry made amends when he headed in from a Stewart Downing free kick with six minutes to go. "England weren't just a little better they were simply better," Germany coach Joachim Loew told German TV. "All in all we deserved to lose." LACK OF CLASS England were missing half a dozen or more of their best players, including Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard, Rio Ferdinand and Wayne Rooney, while Germany were without Michael Ballack, Torsten Frings and Philipp Lahm and the lack of quality showed. Italian coach Fabio Capello, who has re-energised England since his arrival, could at least be satisfied at seeing Gareth Barry and Michael Carrick control midfield in the first half, although there were few clear chances to show for it. The second half was more even, with Germany seeing more of the ball after making a series of substitutions. That allowed England to threaten on the break and, after the ridiculous equaliser, Shaun Wright-Phillips almost gave them the lead back when he cracked the post from outside the box. "It wasn't Scotty's (Carson's) fault, it was mine," Terry told ITV in reference to the Germany goal. "I should have cleared it. It was my fault but I was glad to get on the score sheet and help win us the game.
