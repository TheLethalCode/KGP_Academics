Arturo Olcese told Reuters that Viatri, who allegedly stole a pair of scissors and hair spray along with his brother and a friend, has been accused of robbery aggravated by the possession of weapons. Olcese denied the charges against Viatri, who has scored six goals for Boca in the Apertura championship including the winner in the derby against arch-rivals River Plate.
