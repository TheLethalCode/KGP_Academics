<TITLE> Yuvraj heroics could earn him test return </TITLE>

 KANPUR, India, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian batsman Yuvraj Singh's match-winning hundreds in the first two one-dayers versus England could finally cement his test berth. The 26-year-old left-hander slammed the second fastest ODI hundred by an Indian while scoring 138 not out in the first game against England. He then put on an assured, all-round display with 118 and also took four for 28 bowling slow left-arm spin in the next to put India 2-0 up in the seven-match series. India's test selectors could now reward Yuvraj by recalling him to the middle-order slot vacated after former skipper Saurav Ganguly retired at the end of the 2-0 home series win over Australia earlier this month. In the first game in Rajkot, Yuvraj displayed the brutal power he did on his teenage debut eight years ago when he hit a match-winning 84 against Australia in his first one-dayer. In the second England game on Monday, he showed he could also curb his natural instinct, rescuing India from 29 for three. Chief selector Krishnamachari Srikkanth believes Yuvraj is primed for a return for the two tests against England next month. "I see Yuvi as a potential match-winner in Tests too," he told The Telegraph. "Over the years, he has already shown he's a match-winner in ODIs. "There are others in the running as well (for tests), but Yuvi is definitely a front-runner." A perceived lack of focus has been blamed for Yuvraj not cementing a test berth despite his superb one-day performances. SUSPECT TECHNIQUE The presence of Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Ganguly and Vangipurappu Laxman has also meant he has played just 23 matches since making his test debut five years ago. Some experts believe his technique is inadequate against seaming deliveries on bouncier pitches. The batsman seemed to have ironed out his flaws when he suffered a knee injury in 2006 during a training session. He left his stamp during last year's World Twenty20 triumph in South Africa, hitting England paceman Stuart Broad for six sixes in one over. Recalled to the test side last December following injury to Tendulkar, he stroked a career-best 169 against Pakistan in the drawn third test in Bangalore, sealing a 1-0 series win. But Yuvraj's flop on the subsequent Australia tour cost him his test place. His future looked unsure after scoring 72 runs in five outings in the one-day series win in Sri Lanka in August, losing the vice-captaincy before being ignored for the Australia tests. Srikkanth, a former opening batsman, felt confidence remained the key to Yuvraj's batting. "I've never felt Yuvi has a problem focusing on what he's required to do. I've always seen him as a confidence-player and such players need a couple of good knocks under their belt.
