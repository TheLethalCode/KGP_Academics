<TEXT>
 MADRID, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - David Villa's penalty, a cool finish by Fernando Torres and Santi Cazorla's deflected strike gave Spain a 3-0 win over Chile in a friendly on Wednesday. The referee pointed to the spot in the 36th minute after Albert Riera tangled with defender Ismael Fuentes, although television replays showed there was little contact before the midfielder went to ground. Villa stroked the ball into the net low to the Chile keeper's left for his 24th international goal and almost doubled Spain's lead shortly before halftime when his long-range effort shaved the crossbar. Spain coach Vicente del Bosque replaced Villa with Torres with just over half an hour left at Villarreal's Madrigal stadium and he was quickly on the scoresheet. Xavi burst down the centre and played Torres through on the right of the area. The Liverpool striker took the ball inside Fuentes and placed a precise left-foot shot into the far corner. Del Bosque brought Fernando Llorente on with around 20 minutes left to give the Athletic Bilbao striker his first taste of international action. Cazorla grabbed Spain's third shortly before the end when his drive from the edge of the area ricocheted into the bottom corner off a Chilean defender. Spain top World Cup qualifying Group Five with four wins out of four and are unbeaten in 28 matches since losing a friendly against Romania 1-0 in Cadiz in November 2006
