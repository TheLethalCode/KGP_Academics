 Dhaka, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has granted former state minister for energy AKM Mosharraf two months' bail and stayed the trial of former ministers M Shamsul Islam and M K Anwar in the Barapukuria coalmine corruption case. The bench of justices Md Mozammel Hossain and Afzal Hossain Ahmed asked the government to explain why the proceedings against the BNP leaders should not be cancelled. The hearings on behalf of MK Anwar and AKM Mosharraf were carried out by barrister Ruhul Kuddus Kajal and advocate Shah Alam respectively. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case against 16 persons including former prime minister Khaleda Zia and 10 cabinet colleagues on July 10. Investigating officer of the case, Abul Kashem Fakir, a deputy director of the commission, pressed charges against the 16 with the trial court on Oct. 5. On Nov. 3, the bail petition of Mosharraf was rejected and the accused was ordered to surrender at the trial court by Nov 9, which he did. Mosharraf was later sent to jail. Meanwhile, the bench of justices Tariq-ul-Hakim and Farah Mahbub has halted the proceedings of the corruption case against former forest and environment minister Sajeda Chowdhury for two months. The ACC lodged the case against the senior Awami League leader on July 10. bdne
