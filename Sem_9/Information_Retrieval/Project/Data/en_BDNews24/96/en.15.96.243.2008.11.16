 Dhaka, Nov 16 (bdnews24.com) A Dhaka court sent former prime minister Sheikh Hasina's assistant personal secretary AFM Bahauddin Nasim to jail on Sunday after he had surrendered in an extortion case. Nasim turned himself in around noon in the metropolitan judge's court, where judge Shafiul Azam rejected his bail plea. The judge said his court had no jurisdiction to accept a bail petition in a case filed under emergency powers rules. Businessman Rawshan Ali Master filed the Tk 25 lakh extortion case against Nasim with Shyampur police on Aug. 1, 2007. The case details say Nasim had demanded the money from the plaintiff in exchange for Awami League's nomination of Rawshan as a candidate from Debidwar constituency in Comilla, ahead of the cancelled 2007 general election. The plaintiff allegedly paid the Tk 25 lakh in two installments in mid-2006. Nasim's lawyer Najibullah Hiru said trial of the case had already started. Hiru told bdnews24.com: "Three witnesses appeared in the court on Sunday but their depositions were not recorded." A number of other cases have been filed against Nasim, who is also president of Awami Swechchhasevak League, and has been fugitive since the emergency was declared in Jan. 2007. bdnews24.
