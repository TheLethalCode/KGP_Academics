 Dhaka, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League on Monday sat with the allies in the 14-party combine to reach a consensus over distribution of parliamentary seats as the Nov. 20 nomination deadline looms. "Submitting nominations by the November 20 deadline may turn out to be rather tight unless we reach a consensus over seat distribution by tomorrow (Tuesday)," Rashed Khan Menon, the Workers Party president, told reporters after the meeting. He said the seat distribution among the 14-party allies may not satisfy everyone, but solidarity of the alliance must be upheld, said "All partners of our 14-party alliance must not forget that unity is strength, since we profess to run the national polls together and win the same," Menon said after the meeting at the Awami League's political office in Dhanmandi. The one-hour alliance meeting was held with the AL presidium member Amir Hossain Amu in the chair. "The nation will not accept any excuse or procrastination as regards the December 18 polls. We reiterate that we want the election to be held on December 18 as announced," Amu said. Indicating that unpleasant incidents may occur over the local government polls, Amu suggested: "To avoid any clashes or odd incidents, the upazila polls schedule should better be announced after the parliamentary elections." "The Upazila elections should be deferred by at least 45 days. Realistically speaking, nomination filing for two separate elections on the same day also doesn't sound feasible." He called for lifting the state of emergency before the elections. The Awami League is holding meetings with its allies most cordially, he said. Asked whether they were contemplating forming a 'grand alliance', Amu said, "The 14-party alliance will be our basic alliance; any non-militant and non-communal party upholding democratic ideals will be most welcome to join us." "Taking any new partner on, however, will be finalised in consultation with the alliance supreme Sheikh Hasina." The alliance meeting was attended by Hasanul Huq Inu of JSD-Inu, Enamul Haque of NAP, Ashit Baran Roy of Communist Kendro, Zakir Hossain of Ganotantrik Majdur Party, Nurul Islam of Ganotantri Party, Dilip Barua of Sammyabadi Dal (ML) and Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmad and Suranjit Sengupta of Awami League. bd
