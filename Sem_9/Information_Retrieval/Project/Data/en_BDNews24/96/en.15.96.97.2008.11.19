 Dhaka, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com)  Truth Commission chairman Justice Habibur Rahman Khan said he had not been fully briefed about the High Court verdict which declared the commission illegal. In a regular press briefing on Wednesday, he complained that though he himself was "a party to the case" he was never officially notified about the verdict and was kept away from attending the hearing too. "Even the attorney general didn't say a thing," justice Khan said. He agreed when asked if procedures in the case were "a bit incomplete". The High Court on Nov 13 declared the Voluntary Information Disclosure Ordinance 2008 that spawned the Truth Commission "unconstitutional and illegal". Three days later, the Supreme Court stayed the HC ruling for a month. The chairman said the commission was relieved at the Supreme Court order that allowed it to carry out regular duties which must be finished in a month  the time given by the stay. The former Supreme Court judge also said the commission would work on Saturdays to complete their work. He said some 126 people had been given letters of clemency out of 479 applicants and the government treasury had received a total of Tk 15.36 crore out of nearly Tk 29.88 crore expected. Commission members Manzur Rashid and Asif Ali were also present at the briefing. bdnew
