 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com)  The nomination deadline for parliamentary and Upazila elections has been pushed back three days to Nov. 23 but the election dates of Dec. 18 and 28 remain unchanged, the chief election commissioner told bdnews24.com Wednesday night. Adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman had earlier announced that the government wanted to defer the general election to Dec. 28 and Upazila polls to Jan. 8. But now they planned to go ahead with parliamentary polls on Dec.18 since major parties failed to reach consensus, he said. The announcement apparently capped two days of intense negotiations after BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia on Monday gave the government 48 hours to meet four demands, including a fresh schedule, for the four-party alliance to go to elections. Khaleda met with leaders of the four-party alliance Wednesday evening as the deadline came to a close. The hour-long meeting ended around 7pm on Wednesday at her Dhaka Cantonment residence. Khaleda was expected to give a statement on their wrap up. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda had said hours before they were ready to reschedule the general election for Dec. 28 if the government could get all parties to agree on the date. However, the Election Commission had not received any directives from the government until in the evening, he told reporters. "We've waited until the evening, but are yet to get any hints from the advisers," ATM Shamsul Huda said at around 5:45pm as he left office. "We are still sticking to the existing election schedule for now, but for the sake of participation of all parties, we've no objection to deferring polls." Huda said the government has proposed a 10-day delay, but there needed an all-party consensus in that regard. Given a consensus on holding the general election on Dec 28, upazila polls will be delayed accordingly, he added. The government was expected to give a statement after a meeting between chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed and AtM Shamsul Huda, the chief election commissioner, at the Chief Adviser's Office earlier in the day. The two met for a second time in 24 hours in the wake of intense negotiations on Tuesday over the election schedule. On whether the deadline for nominations was being extended, Huda said after the meeting: "We have given our views and we stick to our previous schedule for now." "Now it is a matter of understanding between the government and the political parties. The government will brief all in this regard." Wednesday's meeting came after leaders of the two major parties hinted that the Dec. 18 vote could be deferred by some days as part of an apparent consensus reached in talks with advisers the previous night. The new date, on or around Dec 28, was considered after the BNP's demand for deferred polls received tacit backing from most quarters, including Dhaka's influential diplomatic community, for the sake of an accord, it emerged. Five advisers on Tuesday evening met Khaleda and also Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina for discussions. bdnews24.com/
