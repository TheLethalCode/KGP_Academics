 Chittagong, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com)  Discontent runs deep among Awami League hopefuls here who failed to secure tickets as the party finalised nominations for all but one seat in the district on Tuesday. Nine of those chosen ahead of the scrapped Jan 22, 2007 polls retained party tickets, but the rest six were new faces for the vote, now scheduled for Dec 18. "I will run as an independent," vowed Mahfujur Rahman Mita, son of a late former AL MP from Chittagong-16 (Sandwip), speaking to bdnews24.com in the evening. "The party ignored me despite so much popular support for me. I am going to start electioneering in Sandwip from tomorrow (Wednesday)." Local AL leader Dr. Jamal Uddin Chowdhury got the party ticket for the offshore seat. Businessman Zafar Ahmed Chowdhury, who sought Chittagong 14 (Satkania-Lohagora), said he would fight as an independent candidate "for the sake of the people of the constituency". Chowdhury, of Chittagong South District AL chapter, told bdnews24.com that he believed he was a better candidate than the party nominee. AKM Sirajul Islam, local AL leader and president of District Lawyers' Association, was chosen for the seat. The seat could eventually go to LDP's Oli Ahmed if the former BNP minister's party joined the AL-led polls alliance. Zafar Chowdhury hinted he would still run for the seat. A few other Chittagong seatsSatkania, Chandanaish, Patiyawere likely to be given away to the AL-led 'Grand Alliance' candidates from other parties. In such a scenario, AL leaders say, the party would then have to deal with more discontent. (For more, see the full list of AL nominees announced so far) bdnews
