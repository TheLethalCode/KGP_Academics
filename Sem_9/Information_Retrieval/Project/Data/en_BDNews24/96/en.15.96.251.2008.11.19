 Dhaka, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court acquitted on Wednesday all the 32 people charged with killing of Titas gas worker Billal, 16 years after the case was filed. Judge KM Rasheduzzaman of the Second Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court released all including Israfil Alam, Awami League leader and candidate from Naogaon-6 for the general election. "Evidence from 18 persons were taken and after analysing that it could not be established if any foul play was involved in the death or not," said the judge. Neither Israfil nor any family member of Billal was present in court during the declaration of the verdict. On July 9, 1992 Billal was pushed over from the seventh floor of the Titas Gas building in the city and killed. Sales official of the organisation, SM Zillur, filed a case with Tejgaon Police Station against 34 persons. During the 15-year process, two of the accused died. Two others, who have been absconding since the beginning of the case, were also cleared of the charges pressed on Sept 30, 1993. Special public prosecutor Syed Mizanur Rahman could not be found when the verdict was being delivered though his presence is obligatory by statute. bdnews24
