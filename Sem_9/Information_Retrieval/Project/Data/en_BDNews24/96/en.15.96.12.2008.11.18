 NAIROBI, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A giant Saudi supertanker hijacked by pirates with a $100 million oil cargo, in the largest ever such seizure, has reached the coast of north Somalia, a regional maritime group said on Tuesday. "Some people are saying they have spotted a huge vessel off Eyl. It must be the supertanker," Andrew Mwangura, coordinator of the East African Seafarers' Association, told Reuters, referring to a remote coastal village used by Somali pirates. The capture of the Sirius Star 450 nautical miles southeast of Kenya's Mombasa port is the furthest and boldest strike to date by Somali pirates. The seizure was carried out despite an international naval response to protect the busy shipping lanes off Somalia in the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean. "The world has never seen anything like this," added Mwangura, whose group has been monitoring piracy off Somalia for years. He said the pirates would probably keep the Sirius about eight miles off Eyl. Mwangura, who bases his information on shipping organizations in the region plus relatives of both crew and pirates, said he believed a hijacked Nigerian tugboat was used as a "mother-ship" in Monday's extraordinary capture. "The supertanker was full loaded, so it was probably low in the water and not that difficult to board," he said, adding that the pirates probably used a ladder or hooked a rope to the side. Normally, the increasingly well-armed and sophisticated Somali pirates use speedboats to carry out the attacks, with the mother ship as a base for their operations. Mwangura said he believed the Somali pirates might have had help from others, possibly Nigerians and Yemenis, for this attack, given its distance from Somalia and the scale of the attack. However, he said he had no firm evidence of that
