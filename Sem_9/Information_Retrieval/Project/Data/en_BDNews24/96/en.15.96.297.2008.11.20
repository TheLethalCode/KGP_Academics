<TEXT>
 Bloemfontein, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh's batsmen found South African pacers too hot to handle and were staring at innings defeat as they followed on on the second day of the first Test at OUTsurance Oval on Thursday. The visitors, skittled out for 153 in the first innings, were 20 for one at stumps in the second innings and need another 268 runs to make the hosts bat again. Tamim Iqbal and Junaed Siddique remained unbeaten on five and seven after debutant opener Imrul Kayes (4) fell to Dale Steyn just before the close. The day saw 19 wickets as many as fall. Bangladesh owe Mushfiqur Rahim a great deal for going past the 100-mark in the first innings. The wicketkeeper-batsman topscored with 48 off 63 balls after South Africa declared their first innings at 441 for nine following a five-wicket haul by left-arm spinner Shakib Al Hasan. Rahim along with Shahadat Hossain put on 60 runs for the ninth wicket before he was trapped leg before by Jacque Kallis. Kallis cleaned up the tail removing Shahadat for 23 off 35 balls, the second individual highest score of Bangladesh innings. Bangladesh lasted only 36.4 overs in the face of fierce spell from pacers Steyn (2/36), Makhaya Ntini (3/20) and Morne Morkel (2/55), who together shared seven wickets for 111 runs. Steyn made the early inroad, sending back opener Tamim (7) in the third over of the innings while Morkel dismissed one-down Junaed (8), who tried to flick the bowler to fine leg, but a leading edge went straight to Ashwell Prince at point. South African skipper Graeme Smith might have been inspired with Shakib's success as gave the new ball to spinner Paul Harris as early as in the 10th over. The left-arm spinner backed the decision by claiming the wicket of Kayes (10) in the last delivery of his second over. The three dismissals left Bangladesh wobbling at 33 for three at tea. Steyn then picked the wicket of Mohammad Ashraful (1) in the fourth delivery after the break as the Bangladesh skipper attempted a flashy cover drive, but the outside edge went to the safe hands of Neil McKenzie at gully. Mehrab Hossain Junior (12) and Shakib (14) managed to reach double digits, but both soon fell to Ntini, who wrecked the middle order by also removing Naeem Islam (8). Earlier, Shakib removed Jacques Kallis (16), AB de Villiers (3), Mark Boucher (15), Morkel (8) and Steyn (1) in a row after pace duo Mashrafee Bin Mortaza and Mahbubul Alam dismissed overnight centurions Hashim Amla and Smith respectively. The left-arm spinner, who remained wicketless on the first day conceding 95 runs, returned five for 130, his second five-wicket haul. Alam took two for 62 and Mashrafee chipped in with one for 69. South Africa, having resumed the day on 299 for one, added 142 runs losing eight wickets as Prince remained unbeaten on 59 off 98. Smith made 157 off248 that included removing 17 fours and one six while Amla scored 112 for 165 studded 15 boundaries. bd
