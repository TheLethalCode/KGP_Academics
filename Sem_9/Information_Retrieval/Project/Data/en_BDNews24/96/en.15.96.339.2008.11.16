<TITLE> LDCs need voice in global crisis talks: FA </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 16 (bdsnews24.com)  The Representative of the 50 least developed countries should have a seat in future global economic summits, said foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury on Sunday. He welcomed the inclusion of developing countries like Brazil, China and India in the G-20 group of nations, who met in Washington DC over the weekend to address the current global economic crisis. "But there is a huge global population from LDCs, who are being left out." "Their impediments to development are structural, and unless these are removed by consultations among top global leadership, millions of the world's poorest will continue to suffer," he told reporters at the foreign ministry. "What you really need to address the issues is ideas, and ideas are not a monopoly of the wealthy nations," he observed. "In fact thoughts and concepts like micro-credit and non-formal education emanating from Bangladesh are really changing the world." He urged global leaders to take note of the fact. Referring to the current global crisis, he said Bangladesh has largely managed to escape its worst effects so far. "This is because our banking system is indeed better regulated with adequate capital-asset ratio, and our real economy is engaged in sectors that are so far insulated." "But we cannot remain complacent because we live in an interdependent, globalised world. The government has to remain ever vigilant with appropriate policy response as and when need arises", Iftekhar concluded.
