<TITLE> French Socialist congress flops, no leader agreed </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 REIMS, France, Sun Nov 16, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - France's main opposition Socialist Party failed on Sunday to agree on a new leader to challenge right-wing President Nicolas Sarkozy, its weekend congress ending in division and acrimony. The congress was intended to agree policy lines and heal rifts that have rendered the Socialists ineffective as an opposition since Segolene Royal led them to a third successive presidential election defeat, against Sarkozy, 18 months ago. Through all fluctuations in opinion polls, Sarkozy has launched domestic reforms and won a high international profile. Royal wants to unite the Socialists to fight back but rivals who blame her for the presidential defeat refused her leadership at the party congress in the eastern city of Reims. "The hand that we held out to the other leaders ... was not seized," Royal said in the middle of the night after marathon talks with her rivals failed to yield a consensus. A polarising figure, the glamorous Royal is seen by admirers as a force for renewal with mass appeal, while her detractors see her as a political lightweight with no consistency. Her speech to the congress on Saturday brought half the audience to its feet to acclaim her while the other half jeered. An opinion poll published on Sunday in the Journal du Dimanche newspaper showed only 32 percent of voters said the party had good leaders. "I'm ashamed for the Socialist Party," a frustrated Francois Hollande, the outgoing leader, told activists on Sunday morning. PERSONALITY CLASHES In the first of three stages to renew leadership, members voted last week on competing "motions", or broad policy ideas. Royal's motion came first with just under 30 percent, Paris Mayor Bertrand Delanoe scored 25 percent and Martine Aubry, a former minister best known as the author of the 35-hour working week, also scored 25 percent. Benoit Hamon, a younger leader from the left of the party, obtained 19 percent. The four were supposed to come up with a compromise text and agree on a consensus leader at Reims, the second stage of the process, but it is painfully clear to everyone at the congress that personality clashes prevented this. Delanoe, Aubry and Hamon are united only in their dislike of Royal, but could not agree on a single candidate to oppose her. The third stage will be a vote, scheduled for Thursday, when party members will have to choose between Royal, Aubry and Hamon, the discouraged Delanoe having dropped out of the race. Whoever wins will head a wounded party, facing the danger of a fourth consecutive defeat in a presidential election. The congress finished with speeches by the three candidates, who all denounced Sarkozy's economic policies, blaming market-friendly ideas for leading to the financial crisis gripping the country and worsening the plight of the poor. "We Socialists must all take to the streets together, supporting social protests," Aubry said. She received a standing ovation from thousands chanting "Martine! Martine!" The main sticking points between Royal and the others were whether to team up with centrists for the 2012 presidential election, and whether to lower fees to join the party. Royal favours these two policies, but her opponents say the party should be firmly anchored to the left, while cheapening party membership would weaken it by diluting its identity
