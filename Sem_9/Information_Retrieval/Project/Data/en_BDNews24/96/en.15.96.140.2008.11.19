 Dhaka, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com)  The revenue earnings may fall in 2008-9 fiscal year as the prices of fuels and foods have slid in the international markets, the National Board of Revenue chairman has warned. Mohammad Abdul Majid sounded the warning in a briefing on Wednesday. "Because of a slump in commodity prices worldwide the import duties in this fiscal year may not fetch our target and the impact of international markets on the local market also may affect the projected VAT realisation," he feared. He said the growth in revenue earnings in FY 2008-9 may fall behind the previous fiscal year's. Majid however hoped revenue earnings estimated in the national budget would meet the target as income taxes this year would enjoy a sound growth. Asked about the amount of fall in the revenue income, the NBR chief said, "Time is not yet ripe for an off-hand answer but we are carefully watching the international market situation. We will be able to comment on the issue a few months later." "All efforts will be made," he said. The NBR statistics show the targeted revenue income in this fiscal year is Tk 10,862 crore against Tk 9,300 crore in the previous financial year. In the import duty sector, the country has earned 21.4 percent in the first quarter (July-Sept) of the target for the current fiscal year against 21.47 percent in the same period of the previous financial year. The growth in revenue incomes in September this year was just 4.99 per cent compared to the figure in September last year though income tax growth clinched 21.44 per cent and VAT grew 31.56 per cent, according to official statistics. The NBR chairman also informed reporters that a total of Tk 11,217 crore had been earned as revenue in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, which is 20.76 percent of the targeted totalTk 55,500 crore. The amount was Tk 9,402 crore in the same period of the previous fiscal and the sector saw 20.37 percent growth in the first three months of FY2008-9. Replying to a question, Majid said they were ready to provide updates on the income tax of the prospective electoral candidates to the Election Commission or other relevant agencies on demand. He said a total of 6.762 lakh people have submitted tax returns. The government fetched Tk 792 crore against Tk 739 crore last year when nearly 6.46 lakh taxpayers filed their tax account statement. The NBR chairman also said the government had earned Tk 108 crore from the undisclosed incomes against last year's Tk 803 crore. "The upper class this year did not legalise their undisclosed incomes but the middle-class did and that is why the government has earned less than what was projected," he pointed out. The NBR would act against the truant taxpayers, he warned. bd
