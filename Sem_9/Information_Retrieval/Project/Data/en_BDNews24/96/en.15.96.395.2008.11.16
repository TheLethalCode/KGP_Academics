<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 16 (bdnews24.com)A full appellate bench will start hearing an appeal by distributors of Red Cow and Nestle milk products on Monday, against a High Court order on retesting their milk brands for melamine. The HC summoned a report on a first round of melamine tests of eight milk powder brands on Nov 6; the government submitted the reports on Nov 9. On Nov 10 last, the High Court ordered the government to submit new test reports after collecting specimens of powdered milk available in the market and having them tested by the Dhaka University's department of chemistry, BSTI and the Atomic Energy Commission. The court also directed the government to publish the reports in the newspaper so that the consumers could make an informed choice on which brands of milk powder to buy. The orders were given on a petition filed by Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh. Appellate Division chamber judge MA Matin denied a request by the appellants on Sunday for a stay on the HC order, and fixed Monday for a full bench hearing on their appeal. Representing the distributors of Red Cow and Nestle were former attorney general Mahmudul Islam and barrister Rokonuddin Mahmud, while advocate Manjil Morshed represented petitioner Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh. On Oct 23 last, the High Court ordered the government to take steps to stop the display and sale of powder milk brands suspected of being contaminated by melamine. The concerned brands were: Diploma, Red Cow, Yashli-1, Yashli-2, Sweet Baby, Dano, Nido and Anlene. bdnew
