 KHOST, Afghanistan, Thu Nov 20,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide car bomber wounded two US soldiers and some Afghans in an attack in eastern Afghanistan on Thursday, a US military spokesman said. The Taliban insurgency has intensified over the past two years and the number of foreign troops has gone up to 70,000, about half of them American. Violence has also spread to the west of the country but is still at its worst along the Pakistani border in the south and east. The bomber blew himself up at the gate of a district government center in Khost province. Khost is opposite Pakistan's North Waziristan region, a sanctuary for Taliban militants and their al Qaeda allies. The wounded soldiers were from the NATO force in Afghanistan, the US spokesman said. He did not know how many Afghans had been wounded. Such attacks are relatively common in Khost and Afghan officials have long complained that the bombers are being sent from militant sanctuaries in Pakistan. But NATO says coordination with the Pakistan military along the porous border has been improving. In the latest incident, NATO soldiers asked the Pakistani military for help on Tuesday after insurgents from Pakistan attacked NATO and Afghan government posts in Paktika province. "The Pakistani military then launched a mortar strike on the insurgents' firing location inside Pakistan," NATO said in a statement
