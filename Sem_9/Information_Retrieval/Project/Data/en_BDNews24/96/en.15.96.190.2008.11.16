 BAGHDAD, Sun Nov 16,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide car bomber killed 15 people, including 7 policemen, and wounded 20 in Iraq's volatile northern Diyala province on Sunday, police said.

Violence has fallen sharply across the country in recent months to some of its lowest levels since the 2003 US-led invasion, but insurgents have retained the ability to carry out bomb attacks. Police and police recruits are a favourite target of insurgent groups such as al Qaeda, who view them as collaborators with the US military
