<TITLE> Hold election for pro-investment atmosphere: German envoy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com)The country needs to hold elections to attract investment to Bangladesh, and build on the "opportunities created in the last two years", German ambassador Frank Meyke said Wednesday. With co-operation from the political parties the government can carry out a free and fair election in December, the ambassador believed. "A pro-investment atmosphere is necessary for Germany to increase investment in Bangladesh," he said talking in Khulna after an AIDS awareness programme. To make the best use of the opportunities created in the last two years, the election needs to be held in December, Meyke said. He said if the people chose the right government then these opportunities would be used properly. On the public perception of "interference" by foreign diplomats in the internal matters of Bangladesh, he said: "To keep the German government informed about the situation in Bangladesh, we have to maintain contact with political figures; interference is not our motive." "Bangladesh has the potential to become a mid-income state by 2020 and to achieve that target the German government will carry on providing cooperation to Bangladesh," promised the ambassador. bdnews24
