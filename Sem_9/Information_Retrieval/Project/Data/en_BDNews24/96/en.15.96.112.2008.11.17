 MILAN, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kaka scored a contested penalty to help AC Milan cut the gap on Serie A leaders Inter Milan to a point with a 1-0 home win over lowly Chievo on Sunday. The Brazilian playmaker netted after appearing to be tripped just outside the box by Simone Bentivoglio on 15 minutes. Napoli also scored thanks to a dubious spotkick but failed to join Milan on 26 points after two late goals gave Atalanta a 3-1 home win in an incident-packed match in Bergamo. Champions Inter won 2-0 at Palermo on Saturday thanks to Zlatan Ibrahimovic's superb double while Juventus, now third on 24 points from 12 games, beat Genoa 4-1 on Thursday.

"It was a foul, but only the video replay can establish if it was in our out, while the human eye cannot," Ancelotti told reporters when asked about Kaka's penalty. "On the pitch we always suffer, maybe we defended a bit too deep." Chievo's defeat in Domenico Di Carlo's second game in charge sent them to the bottom after struggling Reggina produced an excellent display to win 1-0 at sixth-placed Udinese. Franco Brienza volleyed in a ball which dropped quickly over his head to seal a deserved victory over an off-colour Udinese, who badly missed top striker Antonio Di Natale. Fiorentina also lost ground with the leading pack after another debatable penalty handed Cagliari a 1-0 home win over Cesare Prandelli's sid
