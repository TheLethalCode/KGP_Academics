 LONDON, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Arsenal winger Theo Walcott has been ruled out of England's friendly against Germany after dislocating his shoulder, the FA said on Tuesday. Walcott, who was injured in training in Berlin, becomes the latest player to be ruled out of England's squad for the match on Wednesday. Coach Fabio Capello is now without at least eight of his first choice players. "During tonight's training session, Theo Walcott dislocated his right shoulder after falling on the pitch," the FA said in a statement on its website (www.thefa.com). "Theo was taken to hospital, where he has had the shoulder put back into place. Theo will return to the England team hotel tonight and a decision will be made in the morning by the medical staff as to when Theo can fly home." Capello is without Chelsea's Joe Cole, Ashley Cole and Frank Lampard, Manchester United duo Wayne Rooney and Rio Ferdinand and Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard. Wigan Athletic striker Emile Heskey is also injured. "We're all very disappointed, but the most important thing is for Theo to go home and make a quick recovery," Capello said
