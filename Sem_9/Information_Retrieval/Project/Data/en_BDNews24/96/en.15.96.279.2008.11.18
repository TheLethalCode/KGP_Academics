 Dhaka, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com)  Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda went to meet with chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed at his office on Tuesday, a day after BNP and its allies demanded a fresh schedule for the general election. The Election Commission officials said that Huda would discuss with the interim government head whether the polls slated for Dec. 18, could be rescheduled. Huda started for the chief adviser's office at around 2pm along with two other commissioners M Sakhawat Hussain and Muhammed Sohul Hussain for the "crucial meeting". "We are going to the chief adviser's office," Huda reporters but declined to disclose the reason. As per the schedules, the national elections would be held on Dec. 18 and the Upazila polls 10 days later on Dec 28. The last date for filing nomination papers is on Nov 20. Awami League has launched preparations for the ballot but its arch-rival BNP has not.
