 Dhaka, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com)Rowdy supporters of those who have been denied Awami League nominations were seen venting their anger outside party chief Sheikh Hasina's Sudha Sadan residence in Dhanmondi Tuesday. The disgruntled lot were heard chanting slogans demanding their leaders' nominations and against those who received nominations for the parliamentary election. Principal Shah Alam sought the party's ticket to run from Pirojpur-2, but Habibur Rahman Sheikh received the nomination letter for the seat on Monday. Alam's supporters had been gathered in front of Sudha Sadan from Monday night. Another AL aspirant Dr Shamsul Haque Bhuiyan was denied nomination from Chandpur-4 constituency, with Shafiqur Rahman bagging it instead. Bhuiyan's cohorts were among those seen shouting slogans and protesting the decision. bdnews
