<TITLE> No compromise on key issues in WTO talks: India </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India will not compromise on some of the issues which have stalled world trade talks, such as protecting its farm sector, its trade and commerce minister said on Monday. But Kamal Nath said a ministerial meeting could be convened to discuss how to take the Doha round of trade talks forward. "Time lines are not going to dictate the content," he told reporters at the World Economic Forum India Economic Summit in New Delhi. "The question is not having a ministerial. The question is whether our concerns are being met or not." World leaders agreed on Saturday to strive for a major breakthrough in the long-running world trade talks by the end of the year and pledged not to raise any new trade barriers for the next 12 months, as part of a G20 meeting to discuss the worst financial crisis since the 1930s. The world trade talks have lurched from one crisis to the next since countries agreed in 2001 to launch the negotiations. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said at the weekend meeting a successful conclusion to the multilateral trade talks would be an important confidence builder for the world economy. With U.S. President George W. Bush set to leave office on Jan. 20, many countries would like to wrap up the basics of a Doha agreement before his successor, President-elect Barack Obama, takes over. Trade ministers meeting in Geneva in July came very near to reaching a breakthrough, but that effort collapsed when the United States clashed with fellow G20 members, India and China, over the terms of a "special safeguard mechanism" to protect poor country farmers from a surge in imports. EXPORTS REVIEW India's exports have been hit by the global economic slowdown. Export growth in dollar terms slowed to an annual rate of 10.4 percent in September, the slowest pace in 18 months. Nath said the pace at which exports were growing was falling although the country was still on course to meet its 2008/09 export goal of $200 billion. "Right now we are on track. The next five months will determine whether we will be able to meet the target. This again depends on the revival of the western economies," he said. He said the prime minister was meeting his economic committee later on Monday and would discuss what steps to take on exports. "We are looking at various measures which can help sustain exports ... There is a decline in many areas and those areas will need to be addressed," he said. "We are going to look at how a level playing field can be provided to our exporters, which means a total remission of duties and taxes, both local and state.
