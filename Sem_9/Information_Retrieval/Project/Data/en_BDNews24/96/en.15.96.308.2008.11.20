 Dhaka, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com) - Despite a prevailing power shortage in the country, the government has planned to give some 247,000 pumps priority power coverage for the coming irrigation season, some seven percent higher in number than the previous year. "Electricity will be provided on a priority basis for the irrigation season - mid-January to March - and consequently urban areas will experience more power cuts during the period, power secretary M Fouzul Kabir Khan said Thursday. "But authorities have been asked to complete necessary repair works on plants for all available power output during the irrigation season," Kabir said after attending an inter-ministerial meeting, to review power supply for the next season. "Sufficient fuel will also be stored and more electricity will be added to the grid." During the last Boro season, rice cultivated on 45 lakh hectares land was irrigated by 1,183,860 diesel-run pumps and over 200,000 electricity-run pumps, the agriculture ministry says. Authorities of Baghabari and Barapukuria power plants have been asked to undertake necessary repairs before the irrigation season begins for seamless electricity production in the northern region, while electricity supply authorities have been asked to repair lines. For the upcoming irrigation season, electricity production has been determined at 3,700 to 3,800 megawatts during off-peak hours and 4,000 to 4,200 MW during peak hours, compared to an average 3,400 to 3,700 MW in the last irrigation season, the power division said. Currently an average of 3,800 MW is produced daily, according to the Power Development Board. Power division officials say they will have to manage the irrigation season despite a shortfall of gas, the country's main fuel for power production, and plummeting water levels in Kaptai Lake, the site of a major hydropower plant. Electricity production has been reduced by 500 to 600 MW on these two factors. They said the had outlined their gas requirements; if sufficient gas is available, more electricity can be supplied. bdnews2
