<TITLE> Up to govt, parties to agree poll date: US </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com)  US ambassador James F Moriarty has said the Dec. 18 polls could be shifted if the parties and the interim government reached an accord. But, he said, Washington wanted to see a free, fair and credible election take place "as soon as possible". The envoy rejected the notion of diplomatic intervention through backdoor negotiations with political leaders. "I think the roadmap is important. But obviously it's up to the parties and the government to say whether they can stick to that roadmap," he told reporters in Rangamati on Tuesday. "If the major parties and the government agree to delay them, obviously that is fine," Moriarty told reporters in the hill district while inaugurating a project there. "If there are differences of opinion they will have to try and see them out." Moriarty stressed the key issue was to hold a free, fair and credible election. "We do want to see a free, fair and credible election." "I hope the election will be held as soon as possible." It was time for the caretaker government, "which had done a good job", to turn the government over to elected representatives, the ambassador said. Everybody's views should be considered, he added. "And the question is whether the compromise can be made." bdn
