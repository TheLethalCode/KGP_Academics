 Dhaka, November 20 (bdnews24.com)  Election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain is upbeat that all parties will run the general election as per schedule. "We are optimistic that all political parties will take part in the election, as all seem election-oriented now," he said to reporters in his office on Thursday. Earlier in the morning, the Election Commission announced its decision of rescheduling the preparatory activities for the forthcoming polls, when the last date for withdrawing candidature was shifted to Dec. 1. Asked if the election date would be pushed back in case political parties arrive at a consensus, Sakhawat said, "The government is looking into that aspect, because political accord is not the Election Commission's cup of tea." "The Election Commission shepherds the technical negotiations and of course, it should consider any inputs provided by the advisers into the ongoing process." On the polls date deferment, he said, "Any shift in the polls date will all depend on the results of the negotiations." "Anything could be done to realise something which everybody wanted, though the law requires us to hold the polls within December." Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda told reporters Wednesday that the government had been told of the alternative plan for holding the election on Dec. 28 if all parties agreed, as the court required the polls to be held within Dec. "We are ready in case the political parties would like to talk to us," Huda said. Sakhawat volunteered an explanation for extending the nomination filing deadline. "This was done to accommodate those who were waiting to see what the government-political parties negotiations would yield, hence this leniency." "In view of the candidates' requests, the dates have been shifted to facilitate the contestants' nomination filing and paper work." bdnews
