<TITLE> ACC broke no law: HC </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission has not broken laws in filing and investigating graft cases, the High Court ruled on Thursday. "The HC verdict clears a way to set aside 400 cases lodged against the Anticorruption Commission,' ACC lawyer Khurshid Alam told bdnews24.com. "It will facilitate the settlement of other cases." Highlighting a clause of the Anticorruption Commission Act that says investigation must end within 60 days, the High Court said it was not a mandatory clause but an instructive one. The HC bench of justices Anwarul Huq and Farah Mahbub gave the ruling, dismissing an appeal by former BNP lawmaker Habibur Rahman Molla that alleged the ACC had violated due process in filing and investigating its graft cases. "We are happy that the High Court has said in its verdict that the Anticorruption Commission did not abuse any law or judicial process in its work," Khurshid said. Abdul Motin Khosru, lawyer for Molla, told bdnews24.com after the judgement: "An appeal against the verdict will be lodged with the Supreme Court." The ACC on Oct. 3 last year sued Molla on charges of illegally amassing assets worth Tk 2.32 crore and concealing wealth-related information from the commission. The HC stayed the proceedings on July 15, 2007 on Molla's appeal to dismiss the case. bdne
