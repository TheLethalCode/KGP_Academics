<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com)  The two-day Bangladesh-Myanmar technical talks on the delimitation of the sea borders ended on Monday without consensus. The head of the Bangladesh delegation, additional foreign affairs secretary MAK Mahmud, told reporters that further talks would be held in January in Myanmar but schedules had yet to be finalised. "Though a consensus was not clinched Myanmar however has changed its stance 'a little'," he said after the talks ended at around 5:45pm. The second-day discussion began at 10am. Earlier on Sunday, Bangladesh demanded that the delimitation issue must be resolved on the basis of the UN Maritime Convention. Mahmud told bdnews24.com on Sunday evening, "Bangladesh's sea borders were determined along 180 degrees north-south axis in 1974, which Myanmar must not cross." Yangon started oil and gas exploration on the controversial sea borders in the first week of this month, kicking up protests from Dhaka. After days of simmering tension on the borders and naval build-up in the Bay of Bengal the talks began at the foreign ministry on Sunday. Deputy minister Mong Mi headed the Myanmar delegation that arrived in Dhaka the Saturday night. South Korean company Daewoo deployed its engineers and equipment to drill the Bay, backed up by Myanmar warships. Bangladesh rushed navy patrols to the scene to guard the maritime territory as tensions flared up. Daewoo withdrew from the area heeding to Bangladesh's requests. "According to an understanding reached between the two countries neither should carry out exploration activities on their maritime borders," a foreign ministry official said. Bangladesh and Myanmar have ratified the UN Maritime Convention signed in 1982. bdnew
