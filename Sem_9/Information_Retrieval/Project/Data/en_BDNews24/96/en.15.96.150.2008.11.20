The scandal fueled domestic fears about the food safety and dented the "made in China" brand at a time of global slowdown and sluggish exports. The United States has since banned all imports of Chinese food products unless they are certified either free of diary or free of melamine.

It is normally used in making plastics including floor tiles, whiteboards and kitchenware.
