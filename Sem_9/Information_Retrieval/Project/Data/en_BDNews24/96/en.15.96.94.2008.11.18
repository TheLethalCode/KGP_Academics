 Dhaka, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com) - Jatiya Party chairman Hussain Muhammad Ershad said Tuesday he hoped to be president, if his party went to power with the Awami League-led electoral alliance. The former president announced earlier in the day, after meeting with AL president Sheikh Hasina, that his party would contest the upcoming polls as a member of the 'grand alliance'. "We have decided to go to the polls together," Ershad announced after holding a meeting with JP presidium members at his Banani office in the city. "Jatiya Party leaders will sit with the Awami League leaders to discuss its position in the alliance and seat sharing," he said. Ershad also expressed his hope of his becoming president if the alliance went to power. For the cancelled 2007 elections he had such an agreement in writing with AL in this regard, the JP chief said, adding as far as he knew the agreement was still in force. JP was originally a component of the AL-led 'grand alliance' forged for the cancelled general election in 2007. There was some confusion since the 1/11 takeover whether the alliance would be reformed. After the meeting with the AL Ershad had said if the election did not take place on Dec. 18, the chances of the election taking place in the future would shrink. "It will be better if all parties participate." AL spokesman Syed Ashraful Islam said Tuesday: "We will go to polls and form a government together because we made such an agreement before 1/11." However, some grand alliance members, including Workers Party of Bangladesh, have expressed misgivings about taking JP as a partner. bdnews2
