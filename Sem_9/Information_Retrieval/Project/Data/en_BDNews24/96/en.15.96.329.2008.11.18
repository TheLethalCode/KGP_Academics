<TITLE> Pakistan government key for tours, says coach </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KARACHI, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The government has a responsibility to convince reluctant touring sides that it is safe to play in Pakistan, the country's coach Intikhab Alam said on Tuesday. "The issue of foreign teams not coming to Pakistan because of the security situation is not in the hands of the cricket board. Only the government can resolve this matter," he told Reuters in an interview. Pakistan is keeping its fingers crossed over India's scheduled test and one-day series starting in January, the tour seen as crucial to lifting the board's flagging revenues and reviving domestic interest in the game. India need government clearance and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has admitted any decision not to travel could also lead to the International Cricket Council (ICC) shifting the delayed Champions Trophy. The premier one-day event scheduled in Pakistan was postponed from September over security concerns following a spate of suicide bombings and has now been re-scheduled from Sept. 24 to Oct. 5 next year. The ICC has said it would monitor security during the India tour before making a final decision on the event. FUTURE CONCERNS The team's failure to play any tests this year has had a psychological impact on the players, said Alam, a former Pakistan spin bowler. "Yes, it has affected their cricket psyche and they are very concerned about their future," he said. "Even at present they are waiting anxiously to find out if India is coming." PCB chairman Ejaz Butt has said if India refused to tour, the series could be staged in that country by switching Pakistan's scheduled tour across the border in 2010. Alam said: "I agree playing in India would be a better option then playing at offshore venues." Pakistan played just 21 one-day internationals in 2008, winning all but three. However, 11 of those wins came against weak sides Bangladesh, Zimbabwe and Hong Kong. Alam said he would prepare the team for tests through domestic games. "We will organise five-day matches between the national team and rest of Pakistan. That is the only option available to us." Pakistan swept last week's one-day series against West Indies 3-0 in Dubai, but Alam said the team needed to do a lot more to compete at test level
