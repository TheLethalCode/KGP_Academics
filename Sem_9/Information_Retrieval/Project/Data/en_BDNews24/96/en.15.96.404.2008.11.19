 Dhaka, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com) - The US-based National Democratic Institute has expressed the hope that the caretaker government and political parties would quickly resolve any outstanding issues to make the ensuing elections be as "inclusive" as possible. "If the elections are participatory and conducted in an impartial manner, they will be an important step toward restoring the democratic process," Sam Gejdenson, a board member of NDI and former US Congressman said while addressing a press conference in the capital on Wednesday. "If, however, the elections fail to gain the confidence of Bangladesh's citizens, they could lead to a continued erosion of the nation's democratic institutions and further entrench the role of the military in governing the country," he warned. Sam Gejdenson said, "All the of the nation's political parties have not yet agreed to participate in the coming polls. Broad participation in fair and credible election is an essential feature of a democracy." Replying to a question, Sam said, electoral environment is now congenial than before. The NDI delegation placed a set of recommendation to the Election Commission, government, political parties, civil society and the military. "The delegation recommends first and foremost that the state of emergency should also be lifted as soon as possible and the military accept its proper role in a democratic society and refrain from intervening in the political and electoral process." The NDI recommendations said the election commission should review campaign finance limitation, in consultation with the parties, to determine if such limitations are realistic. Review the issue of shutting down mobile phone networks to determine if there are alternative ways to ensure public safety on election day. Recommend to the caretaker government, the NDI statement said, "Continue dialogue with the political parties and election commission to ensure broad participation in the election, not deploy police or military personnel on election day in polling stations or in a manner that appears intimidating to voters or that interferes with the electoral process." The NDI recommendations to the political parties said, "Agree to sustain several of the reforms adopted by the caretaker government, continue efforts to reform their parties internally to make them more democratic and responding organisations, agree to end hartals, provide for a meaningful role for the opposition in parliament." Saumura Tioulong, member of the national assembly of Cambodia, Peter Manikas, senior associate and regional director for NDI's Asia programs and Jacqueline Corcoran, NDI's Bangladesh resident senior director also attended the press conference. bd
