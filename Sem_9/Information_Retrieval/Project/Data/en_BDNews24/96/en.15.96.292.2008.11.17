 Panchagarh, Nov 16 (bdnews24.com)  An infant, the mother and another Bangladeshi were killed late Sunday night by Indian Border Security Force men on the country's northernmost border, said a BDR official. "The deceased were identified as 35 year-old Golam Mustofa, 25-year-old Majeda Begum and her one-year-old infant Mamun," Maj. Sheikh Farid, in-charge of Panchagarh-25 Battalion, told bdnews24.com. At least one other person, Majeda's husband Shahidul, 30, was critically wounded and taken to Rangpur Medical College Hospital. BSF personnel entered Moyanaguri village of the Majhipara border area in Tentulia, crossing near the frontier's Pillar-435 at around 10.15pm, the major said. They opened fire after villagers had intercepted them, he said. Shahidul, Majeda and Mamun were shot as they lay asleep in their home, said villagers. Shahidul's neighbour, Alamgir Hossain said: "I was woken by the sound of gunfire and realised it was BSF. I cycled to Matirpara BDR camp for help." The Indian border guards eventually withdrew. "BDR members with villagers later captured one BSF man, who appeared drunk," the major said. "Homes, riddled with bullet holes, were deserted as villagers took shelter at the local high school," bdnews24.com's correspondent reported from the scene around midnight. "Senior BDR officers are present at the scene. Both BDR and BSF have reinforced their presence along the border," Major Farid told bdnews24.com. bdnews24.c
