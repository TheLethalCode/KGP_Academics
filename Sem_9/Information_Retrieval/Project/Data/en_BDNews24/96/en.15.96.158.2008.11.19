 Dhaka, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com)  BNP will heed its grassroots opinions to nominate election candidates, said the party's secretary general on Wednesday. "BNP would like it very much to contest the polls alongside all other parties. But we certainly are averse to be a party to any 'got-up' election," Khandaker Delwar Hossain said. He made the remarks while addressing the party leaders while BNP's Dhaka Division organising committee report was being presented. "Nor will we validate such 'fake' activities." Tanveer Ahmed Siddiqui, member of the party's standing committee, handed the report over to the secretary general. Receiving the document, Delwar said, "The emergency rule in effect impacted our party, landing graver blows than the sinister cyclone Sidr." "The party's grassroots have, however, remained intact maintaining high morale. Their performance in the face of foul weather will soon be justly evaluated." Warning the supporters against the duplicity of the 'bystanders' within, he said, "All must remain on guard so that no one should, in the future, dare attempt causing any rift in our solidarity." Former lawmaker Sohrabuddin, Shah Nurul Kabir Shaheen, Shireen Sultana, Fahima Hossain and other Dhaka Division leaders were present. BNP had, towards end-September, formed six divisional organising committees ahead of the elections to assess the local situations realistically. bd
