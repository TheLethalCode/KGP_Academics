 Dhaka, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com)  A nationwide drive on pre-election illegal arms recovery and arrest of offenders has been intensified, inspector general of police Nur Mohammad said Tuesday. "But there is no immediate threat to the law and order situation and the police department doesn't see an immediate need for a special campaign in the light of the upcoming elections," he said. "But special drives will be launched immediately if and when needed. Arms recovery drive is going on, and we are also nabbing the miscreants," the IGP added. Nur Muhammad was speaking at the Uttara armed battalion field in the city on Tuesday, at an anti-drugs programme where bulldozers were used to smash the drugs recovered by RAB from 2004 to 2008 under the campaign "Give up drugs, build a terror free nation." He urged all to join hands in the campaign to rescue the country from the shackles of drugs and drug dealers. Present at the programme, RAB director general Hasan Mahmud Khandaker, said police and RAB would work together to help ensure law and order and holding of free, fair and credible elections. Steps in this regard will be disclosed in details a week before the elections, he said. "There are 50 lakh drug addicts in the country, 91 per cent of them being 21-25 years old which is bad news," said the RAB DG. Huge quantities of Yaba tablets, ice-pill tablets, viagra, heroin, cocaine, injectable drugs, phensydil, marijuana, local and foreign alcohol were destroyed in the campaign, RAB officials informed. The programme lasted for six hours from 11 am. Among others present were celebrities such as actors Razzak and Sakib, actress Apu Biswas, singer Fahmida Nabi as well as Dhaka metropolitan police commissioner Nayeem Ahmed, RAB additional DGs and battalion commanders. bdnews
