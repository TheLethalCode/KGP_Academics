 Dhaka, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com)  Liberal Democratic Party chairman Oli Ahmed said Thursday his party will join Awami League and form a unity government if voted to power. The announcement followed a meeting between AL president Sheikh Hasina and LDP leaders at the former prime minster's Sudha Sadan residence. Emerging from the meeting, Oli said, "The meeting was held in a friendly atmosphere; we have decided to contest the polls together and form a unity government." Asked about seat-sharing, the LDP chief did not make any comment. AL and LDP leaders, differing from Oli's statement, said the two parties reached a consensus over forming a unity government, but would contest the election separately. Minutes before Oli Ahmed's announcement, LDP secretary general Jahanara Begum said, "Our unity will be in forming government, we will go to elections separately." Referring to AL and Jatiya Party's decision to contest the polls together and form a unity government if voted, she was asked whether her party's consensus with the AL was identical. Jahanara replied, "[Hasina] did not say so; we will contest separately." AL presidium member Sheikh Selim also said they had reached a consensus over forming a unity government. bdnews24.com/
