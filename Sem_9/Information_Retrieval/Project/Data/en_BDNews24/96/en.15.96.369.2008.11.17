<TITLE> Telecoms growth phenomenal: World Bank </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com)  The telecommunications sector has clocked an extraordinary growth over the last five years with the number of telephones per 100 people rising to around 33 from around two in 2001, the World Bank said on Monday. In a press statement, the bank said the WB-funded Telecommunications Technical Assistance Project (TTAP) is supporting the government to improve the performance of the telecommunications sector. TTAP, which started operation in 2003 with a finance target of $ 10.5 million, is helping the sector in refurbishing its management policy and regulatory frameworks. The July 2008 restructuring of the Bangladesh Telephone and Telegraph Board (BTTB) into two public limited companies, the Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Limited (BTCL) and the Bangladesh Submarine Cable Company Limited (BSCCL) was also supported under TTAP. It was a major milestone, the bank said, in achieving competitiveness and reform in the sector. "TTAP is also supporting the implementation of the National Spectrum Management and Monitoring System and the automated spectrum management system and fixed monitoring station in Dhaka are now fully installed," the press release said. Two mobile monitoring vehicles have also been made operational to enable Bangladesh telecommunications Regulatory Commission to better monitor the radio spectrum, and resolve spectrum interference issues. The entire National Spectrum Management and Monitoring System is expected to be commissioned by first quarter of 2009. To further improve the sector's performance, it was important to amend the Telecommunications Act to allow BTRC adequate financial and organisational autonomy to promote and regulate a fast-changing sector, the bank suggested. bd
