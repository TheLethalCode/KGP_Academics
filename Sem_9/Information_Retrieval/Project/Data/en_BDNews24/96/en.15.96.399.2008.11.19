 Dhaka, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com)  The chief election commissioner said Wednesday the EC was ready to reschedule the general election for Dec 28, pushing it back ten days, if the government could get all parties to agree on the date. However, the Election Commission had not received any directives from the government till evening, he said. "We've waited until the evening, but are yet to get any hints in this regard from the advisers," ATM Shamsul Huda said at around 5:45pm as he left his office. "We are still sticking to the existing election schedule for now, but for the sake of participation of all parties, we've no objection to deferring polls." Huda said the government has proposed a 10-day delay, but there needed an all-party consensus in that regard. Given consensus on holding the general election on Dec 28, upazila polls will be delayed accordingly, he added. The government had been set to give a statement on Wednesday after a meeting between the chief adviser and chief election commissioner at the Chief Adviser's Office earlier in the day. The CA and CEC met, for the second time in 24 hours, in the wake of intense negotiations on Tuesday over the election schedule. On whether the deadline for nominations was being extended, the CEC said: "We have given our views and we stick to our previous stance." "Now it is the matter of understanding between the government and the political parties. The government will brief all in this regard." Wednesday's meeting came after leaders of the two major parties hinted that the Dec. 18 vote could be deferred by some days as part of an apparent consensus reached in talks with advisers the previous night. A new date, on or around Dec 28, was considered after the BNP's demand for deferred polls received tacit backing from most quarters, including Dhaka's influential diplomatic community, for the sake of an accord, it emerged. CEC ATM Shamsul Huda on Wednesday was accompanied by two other commissioners M Sakhawat Hussain and Muhammed Sohul Hussain to the CA's Office. bdnews24.c
