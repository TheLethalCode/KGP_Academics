 KANPUR, India, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England's Graeme Swann is set to play in the third one-day international against India after the off spinner was named in a 12-man squad on Wednesday. However, left-arm seamer Ryan Sidebottom's hopes of returning to the side for Thursday's contest were dented after he underwent a scan for a back problem, having just recovered from an Achilles injury that kept him out of the first two games. India lead the seven-match series 2-0 after impressive victories fashioned by Yuvraj Singh's back-to-back hundreds. The 29-year-old Swann is a finger spinner who played a useful role in last year's one-day series victory in Sri Lanka, claiming seven wickets in four matches. "Because I haven't played in the first two games, I'm in quite a unique position and should I get in the eleven tomorrow which I hope to do, I can walk out as if it is a fresh series," the bowler told reporters after practice on Wednesday. "The series in Sri Lanka last year was a five-match series. That is a good length series for a spin bowler, doesn't get too tired and doesn't get worked out by the batsmen." All-rounder Ravi Bopara, one of the players who could make way for Swann, did not attend nets due to a stomach upset. England squad: Kevin Pietersen (captain), Ian Bell, Matt Prior (wicketkeeper), Owais Shah, Andrew Flintoff, Paul Collingwood, Samit Patel, Ravi Bopara, Stuart Broad, Steve Harmison, James Anderson, Graeme Swann
