 Dhaka, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com) - A new electoral alliance, the Jatiya Jukta Front, came into being on Tuesday formed by Bikalpadhara Bangladesh, Gano Forum and other lesser-known parties. "We urge all the pro-liberation, secular, democratic parties to be united, being inspired from the Juktafront formed in 1954," the newly-formed alliance leaders said in a joint statement. Bikalpadhara Bangladesh president Badruddoza Chowdhury and Gano Forum president Dr Kamal Hossain read out the statement at a news conference at a hotel in the city. They said the people of the country had seen a ray of hope following the 1/11 changeover, but were disappointed with the interim leaders' compromises with corrupt people. Launching the alliance, they said their slogan was  'Politics for change'. Bangladesh Kalyan Party, National Awami Party, Labour Party, Forward Party, Bangladesh People's Party have expressed their solidarity with the alliance, they said. Asked why he backtracked from his earlier stance of becoming a member of the Awami League-led 'grand alliance', Badruddoza answered: "Now we want to form a 'grand grand-alliance'." He said the Jatiya Jukta Front will contest in the upcoming polls with all like-minded parties, but did not elaborate on how many constituencies the alliance will run in. Kalyan Party chairman Syed Muhammad Ibrahim, Kansat Movement leader Golam Rabbani and television presenter Abdur Noor Tusher were present at the press conference. bdnews
