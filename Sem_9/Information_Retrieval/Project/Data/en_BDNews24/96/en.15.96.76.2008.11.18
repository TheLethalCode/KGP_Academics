<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com)The European Commission has decided to send a full-fledged election observer team for the scheduled Dec 18 parliamentary polls, saying conditions have been created for "a free, fair and credible election". The decision follows the repeal of elements of the Emergency Powers Rules in early November, said the European Commission. "The decision to re-deploy the full Election Observer Mission constitutes a recognition of the impressive progress made by the government, Election Commission and other authorities to create conditions conducive to a free, fair and credible election," said Stefan Frowein, head of the European Commission Delegation to Dhaka, in a statement Tuesday. The decision was taken following the repeal of elements of the Emergency Powers Rules in early November, said the European Commission (EC), and marks the first the EC has sent observers for elections that may be held under a state of emergency. "The European Commission knows that both the international community and the Bangladeshi people have looked forward to this decision on the re-deployment (of the EU team)," the statement quoted Benita Ferrero-Waldner, Commissioner for External Relations, as saying. Ferrero-Waldner has communicated her decision to chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed in a letter. "The Commission, from the very beginning, was committed to re-activate the EOM once acceptable conditions for the conduct of democratic elections were in place," she said. "The European institutions and the Member States have attached great importance to, and have supported, the political and legal reforms in Bangladesh since January 2007 that aimed at setting the right conditions for credible and democratic elections in December 2008." "Notwithstanding the difficulties that still exist, I now believe that the conditions exist which allow the EU EOM to be redeployed. I encourage both the Caretaker Government and the political parties to make all efforts to ensure this election reflects the will of the Bangladeshi people who always expressed their commitment to democratic government," said Ferrero-Waldner. Stefan Frowein added: "The European Commission has sent a signal of its confidence in the preparations for the parliamentary elections and its absolute commitment to scrutinising this critical event in the democratic history of Bangladesh." "It is now incumbent upon all political stakeholders to discharge their democratic duties in a manner which is mindful of the stability and prosperity of this country." A number of experts on election assessment, who will form the Core Team of the Mission, arrived in the country on Nov 7 to report on whether the military-backed caretaker government had ensured civil and political rights ahead of polls  a condition set by the EC for sending a full-fledged Election Observation Mission. The re-deployed EOM, which had been suspended after the cancellation of the January 2007 elections, will be led by Euro MP Alexander Graf Lambsdorff. Altogether some 150 EU observers will be in place on Election Day. This is a major commitment to Bangladesh's democratic development, says the EC. They will remain in the country for up to 3 weeks after Election Day to observe the post-election period. The EU does not in principle send observers to monitor elections under emergency. However, terming Bangladesh's emergency "different from others", it had urged the government to restore certain civil and political rights "even under a relaxed state of emergency" to convince the EC Commissioner to send an observer mission. "If the legal and practical circumstances conducive to free, fair and credible elections are not in place on the ground, the EU will refrain from wholesale observation," Frowein had warned. The commission cancelled its polls observation mission ahead of the declaration of the state of emergency on Jan. 11 last year. The EU sends short-term, long-term and core observation missions to monitor polls. bdnews
