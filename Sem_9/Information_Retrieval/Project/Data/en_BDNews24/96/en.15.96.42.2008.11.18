 Dhaka, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com) - Thousands of people in Gaibandha district on Tuesday called on richer countries, who cause most of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, to cut their national carbon emissions. A procession of people most vulnerable to climate change, wearing headbands reading "stop harming, start helping", called for more help for developing countries like Bangladesh to undertake adaptation measures to reduce their vulnerability to the negative impacts of climate change, an Oxfam press release said. Enlisting the help of elephants, cows, donkeys and horses to get their messages across, people took part in a procession and staged a rally to raise awareness of climate change, and its impact on the most vulnerable communities. Two elephants joined the crowd, one bearing the national flag of the United States, symbolising the slow progress made by the world's leading industrialised nations to take steps to reduce global warming. The mass mobilisation is the first of a series organised by Oxfam and its key partner, Campaign for Sustainable Rural Livelihoods, ahead of the United Nations conference on climate change in Poznan, Poland, on Dec 1-12. Participants most of them farmers and women living in char areas, who have been forced to shift their homes many times because of river erosion, caused by flooding and heavy rainfall, said climate change had made it harder to farm and feed their families. In the last few years Bangladesh, already prone to cyclones and other weather-disasters, has seen an increase in the intensity and frequency of climate related problems. Changing conditions have meant weather-related disasters have become less predictable and more difficult to manage. Scientists have predicted that Bangladesh could lose up to 17% of its land by 2050 because of rising sea levels due to global warming.
