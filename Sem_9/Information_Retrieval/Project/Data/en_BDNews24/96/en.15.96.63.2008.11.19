<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com)  The cabinet committee on public purchase on Wednesday asked authorities to float a new tender for 450-megawatt Bibiana power plant in Habiganj. "The previous proposal has been cancelled due to high price and a new bids will be invited soon," the chief adviser's special assistant on power and energy, M Tamim, said. Electricity was being purchased from 15-year rented power plants at a rate of 4.299 cents per kilowatt, Tamim said. He added in case of Bibiana power plant, considering its duration, the price should have been lower than Malaysia's Powertek Consortium had proposed. Electricity will be bought from Bibiana for 20 years, and the Powertek proposed 4.399 cents for per kilowatt electricity, power ministry sources said. Of the four firms provisionally selected to set up Bibiana power plant, only Powertek Consortium submitted a final proposal. Its two partners were Electric Power Company of South Korea and Siemens of Germany. The Powertek's proposal was sent to the cabinet purchase committee after government's technical committee and power cell said the proposal was acceptable. bdn
