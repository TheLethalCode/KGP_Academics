 Dhaka, Nov 16 (bdnews24.com)  Children of Bangladeshi mothers married to foreign nationals will gain automatic Bangladeshi citizenship, according to an amendment of the Citizenship Act 1951, the chief adviser's press secretary said Sunday. The Citizenship Act Amendment Ordinance 2008 was passed by an advisory council meeting chaired by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed. Press aide Syed Fahim Munaim told reporters after the meeting that, following the approval of the new ordinance, either parent being Bangladeshi will now ensure Bangladeshi citizenship, regardless of place of birth. The meeting also approved ratification of the BIMSTEC Convention on Combating International Terrorism, Transnational Organised Crime and Illicit Drug Trafficking. The Dhaka Shishu Hospital Ordinance 2008, after extensive discussion, was also approved in principle in the meeting, said Munaim. The cabinet division presented a report on the activities of different ministries in FY 2007-8. The meeting directed the ministries to submit reports individually. Cultural adviser Rasheda K Chowdhury told the meeting preparations for Dhaka's 400-year anniversary celebrations were well underway. The programmes will be inaugurated on Nov 28, said Munaim.
