 Dhaka, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com)  The Truth Commission has extended the deadline for clemency seekers for a second time to Nov. 20, its chairman said. Justice Habibur Rahman Khan told bdnews24.com on Monday the previous Nov. 16 deadline had been extended "as activities were suspended following Thursday's High Court verdict declaring the commission illegal." The Supreme Court halted the High Court verdict on Sunday for one month, prompting the commission chairman and his colleagues to resume work on Monday, he added. On returning to office, the commission held a meeting to discuss the plight of clemency seekers during the suspension of the commission's activities, and decided to extend the timeframe to file petition. Justice Rahman said the commission was fast-tracking its efforts to finish the job within a month in the light of the stay order. The tenure of the Truth Commission ends in early January next year. The clemency appeal deadline was originally set for Oct. 30 and extended for the first time to Nov 16. The last date for submission of application was Sept. 30 after the commission commenced operations on Aug. 3. President Iajuddin Ahmed signed into law the Voluntary Information Disclosure Ordinance 2008 on June 8 to clear way for the commission to come into being. bdnew
