 Dhaka, Nov 16 (bdnews24.com) - The Truth Commission will resume operations after a day's suspension, said its chairman Justice Habibur Rahman Khan on Sunday, hours after the Supreme Court halted a High Court order that declared the commission illegal. The chairman and its two members will attend office and perform their regular work from Monday, he said as the Appellate Division stayed the order for one month while the government sought to appeal against the ruling. The High Court, ruling on a writ petition last Thursday, declared the Voluntary Disclosure Ordinance 2008 that begot the Truth Commission illegal and unconstitutional. The chairman and its members suspended activities for a day on Sunday, as the commission was ordered to stop its work after the High Court ruling. Justice Habibur told bdnews24.com Saturday the commission's functions would be halted until a final verdict by the Supreme Court regarding the legality of the commission's work. On Monday, in line with the attorney general's opinion, he said there was no barrier to attending office after the Supreme Court's stay order. "But before attending office we have to see a copy of the order," he added. The commission's hearings slated for Sunday would be held at a later date but the hearings set for Monday would take place as scheduled, he added. President Iajuddin Ahmed signed into law the Voluntary Information Disclosure Ordinance on June 8. Supreme Court lawyer Adilur Rahman Khan, executive director of UBINIG Farida Akter, AL's women affair secretary Dr Dipu Moni and acting director of Odhikar Nasiruddin Elan filed the writ petition with the High Court on Aug 28 challenging the legality of the ordinance. bdnews24
