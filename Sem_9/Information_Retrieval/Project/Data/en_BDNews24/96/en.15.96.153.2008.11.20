<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong Awami League president mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury has endorsed the four party nominees from the port city as 'fit'. Mohiuddin told bdnews24.com on Wednesday, a day after the AL gave them the nod to run for the upcoming polls, he would cooperate fully with the candidates. He hoped the party supporters would set aside differences and work together to regain the lost seats in Chittagong. Three out of four nominees in the city are backed by the mayor and Nurul Islam, the other nominated from Kotwali, is known to have been at loggerheads with Mohiuddin for long. Before nomination, during the grass-roots voting for nominees, Mohiuddin allegedly snatched away the ballot boxes on Nov. 9. Asked about the conflict with Nurul Islam, he told bdnews24.com and a local journalist that he would work for the candidates the central leaders considered qualified to run. "If no big incident occurs, these four candidates will vie for the election," he said. In 2001 elections all three AL candidates conceded to BNP rivals. Two of the defeated candidates did not get tickets this time. In the nomination race, city AL vice president Nurul Islam replaced former minister MA Mannan in Kotwali (Chittagong-8), city AL treasurer industrialist Abdus Salam replaced industrialist SM Abul Kalam in Chandgaon-Boalkhali (Chittagong-7), and Afsarul Amin retained his nomination from Double Mooring (Chittagong-9). After the recent delimitation of constituencies, new constituency Bandar-Patenga (Chittagong-10) has been added in the port city and city joint secretary Khorshed Alam Sujon got ticket for the seat. All three except Nurul Islam are known to be mayor Mohiuddin's close aides. bdnew
