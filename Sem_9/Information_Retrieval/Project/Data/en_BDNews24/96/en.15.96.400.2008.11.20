<TITLE> BNP ready for Dec 28: Khaleda </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com)  BNP will to go to the general election on Dec. 28, if conditions are met, Khaleda Zia announced in a televised briefing after back-to-back meetings of her party and allies on Thursday. In an immediate reaction, commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman, the government's spokesman, said they had nothing to say at the moment but would give a decision after further discussions. The Election Commission voiced satisfaction over the announcement, however, calling the apparent compromise "fair progress". "We will certainly contest the election if it is held on December 28," Khaleda said in her televised statement, but maintained that three conditions -- one month deferment of Upazila election, repeal of RPO's 91E provision and total lift of state of emergency -- have to be met. The BNP chief said, "We urge the government to create a congenial atmosphere for the election ... without making unilateral decisions." Khaleda said democracy must be brought back to the country through election and argued an election under emergency could not be free and fair. She maintained that not only the two rival alliances and the caretaker government, but "the nation-loving people as well as the heritage, image and neutrality of the armed forces are concerned in the whole process". "So we must be much more on guard so that none can put the armed forces' neutrally in question." Khaleda, in her two-page written statement, also pointed out that her party had not contested in the Aug 4 city corporation and municipal elections because of their objection to holding them under emergency. She had earlier steered an hour-long meeting of her party's top policymaking forum followed by four-party talks to come to a decision on joining the general election -- 72 hours after she announced the alliance's four-point demands. She had given the government 48 hours on Monday night to meet the four demands of BNP and its allies to go to elections. They included total withdrawal of the state of emergency and re-announcement of the election schedule for the sake of pilgrims who are now in Saudi Arabia to perform hajj. Repeal of section 91E of the Representation of the People Ordinance that gives the Election Commission power to cancel candidacy, and deferment of Upazila polls are the other two demands. In her statement, Khaleda alleged the government and the Election Commission had been conspiring to keep the four-party alliance out of the election and destroy the country's democratic forces. She demanded that section 91E of the RPO be repealed as the "biased" Election Commission could not be trusted. As part of the efforts to destroy the democratic forces, Khaleda alleged, the government tried to "obliterate" her family and "keep them out of politics". "Even after everything, considering the country's democratic progress, BNP had agreed to contest in the polls and gave seven demands to the government to create a favourable environment." "But the government only wasted time instead of meeting our demands, which the government had pledged to," she added. The government launched into frantic discussions with the Awami League and BNP-led alliances on Tuesday, but the stakeholders failed to reach consensus over delaying the polls. Finally, the government on Wednesday announced that the election would be held on Dec. 18 as scheduled, though the Election Commission has given new deadlines for nominations and withdrawal of candidacy saying it was also ready to defer the election date by ten days if all parties could agree. bdnews24.
