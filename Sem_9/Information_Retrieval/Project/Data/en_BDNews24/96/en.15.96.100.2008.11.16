<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 16 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh batting line shone bright in the lone warm-up match against South African Airways Challenge XI with Imrul Kayes and Mushfiqur Rahim smashing fifties in Kimberley on Sunday. The two-day match, however, ended in a draw at De Beers Diamond Oval as the hosts were 74 for two in the second innings at close of the final day with Jonathan Beukes and Andre Seymore remaining unbeaten on 23 and 14 respectively. Pacer Shahadat Hossain removed opener Divan van Wyk (27) and one-down Khayelihle Zondo (first-ball-duck) in successive two deliveries. Earlier, Bangladesh having started on overnight total of 92 for two added 283 on the second day to finish at 375 all out in reply to the hosts' first inning total of 265. Opener Imrul converted his overnight 30 into 86 while his partner Mohammad Ashraful was just two runs shorts of a fifty before the Bangladesh skipper was caught by Wendell Bossenger off Lundi Mbane, triggering a middle order collapse. They together repaired the early damage to put on 113 runs for the third wicket after Tamim Iqbal (34) and Junaed Siddique (first-ball-duck) fell cheaply to two successive deliveries by Mthokozisi Shezi on the first day. Imrul smashed 15 fours playing 150 balls before being caught by Warren Swan off Shezi while Ashraful hammered nine fours in his 50-ball knock. After the dismissal of Ashraful, Bangladesh slipped to 220 for six from 164 for three as Mehrab Hossain Junior (8) and Shakib Al Hasan (19) returned to the dressing room cheaply. Mushfiqur and Naeem Islam then built up another resistance for the seventh wicket adding 116 runs before the latter was out for 33, leaving the side at 336 for seven in 72.4 overs. The wicketkeeper soon followed Naeem to be trapped in front by Charl Petersen, sparking the late-order slump. Mushfiqur was out for 89 what would have been a deserved century. He struck 16 boundaries in 124 balls. Shezi was the pick of the attack with four for 42 while Petersen was the most expensive bowler for the hosts to have conceded 100 runs in 23 overs in return of two wickets. Bangladesh will take on South Africa in the opener of the two Test series from Nov 19 in Bloomberg. bd
