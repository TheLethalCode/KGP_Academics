 Maruf Mallik bdnews24.com telecoms correspondent Dhaka, Nov 16 (bdnews24.com)  Illegal VoIP dealers will lose their ISP licences, the Bangladesh Telecommunications Regulatory Commission has warned. A top commission official, who asked he not be named, told bdnews24.com that any ISP found engaged in illegal VoIP activities would "lose the ISP licence right away". Asked by bdnews24.com, BTRC chairman Manzurul Alam spoke of "zero tolerance policy" and said the illegal VoIP activities would defeat the very purpose of giving IGW licences. "We have given international gateway licence to energise the telecom sector. IP telephony licence will be given soon but the sector will be affected if the illegal VoIP continues," BTRC chairman Manzurul Alam told bdnews24.com after a meeting Sunday. BTRC last week raided different establishments of Broadband Solutions Ltd. at Banani, Shantinagar and Malibagh in the city. The commission found evidences of use of the bandwidth in illegal call termination. M Tanjin Alam, the company's managing director, and Zahurul Islam Sheikh, the CEO, confessed to interrogators that they were indeed terminating calls illegally, the commission officials said. "BTRC officials therefore have sealed their establishments on charge of violating the conditions and instructions stipulated in the licence," the commission officials said, adding they also seized equipment used for the illegal activities. One BTRC official said the regulators would continue their drive round the clock. bdne
