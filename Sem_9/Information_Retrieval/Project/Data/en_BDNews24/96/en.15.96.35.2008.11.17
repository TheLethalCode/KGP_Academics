 Dhaka, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com)The Bangladesh-Myanmar sea boundary delimitation talks ended Monday without any agreement, though some "incremental progress" was made, said a foreign ministry official. Additional foreign secretary MAK Mahmood, who led the Bangladesh side at the technical-level talks, said Yangon "objected" to Dhaka's call for freezing oil and gas exploration works in the disputed waters until all disputes were settled. Mahmood termed the meeting "fruitful", nevertheless, saying Myanmar had shifted from her previous stiff position. He added that the two sides agreed to resume talks at a "convenient time" in Myanmar, in January. "We have presented a proposal. Myanmar proposed theirs. But we have not been able to reach a consensus in this regard," Mahmood told reporters after the meeting at foreign ministry. "If we accept their proposal, our sea zone will be locked". "However, the discussion was fruitful in the sense that some incremental progress has been made. Myanmar has shifted from its previous position," he said. Mahmood said Dhaka reiterated its call not to carry out oil and gas exploration in the disputed waters in the Bay until the issue of demarcation was resolved. "But they raised objections. They said the point (where Myanmar explored oil and gas activities) was closer to their coastline," he said. According to sea boundary act 1974, the disputed waters was inside Bangladesh's territory. But Yangon makes counter-claim and demands huge portion of waters inside Bangladesh's territory in Bay of Bengal. Meanwhile, foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury told reporters that Bangladesh must protect its sea water. "Our waters is our's. We want the issue resolved through peaceful means," he told bdnews24.com following his meeting with the visiting Myanmar deputy minister Maung Myint at his office at foreign ministry. "This is very complex issue. It will not be solved over night. I hope it will be settled in future," he said. Bangladesh and its reclusive neighbour Myanmar began sea boundary delimitation talks in April this year after a pause of 22 years, with the two countries reaching a consensus that neither of the sides would go for oil and gas exploration in the disputed waters. But Myanmar, formerly known as Burma and ruled by military junta since 1962, violated the agreement earlier this month, sending vessels to the disputed waters for exploration work carried out by South Korean industrial giant Daewoo. The area of exploration is claimed by both sides, and a military face off resulted in the Bay. Foreign secretary Md Touhid Hossain went to Myanmar to defuse the tension. He met deputy minister Maung Myint, in charge of sea boundary delimitation, who agreed to hold talks on Nov 16 and 17. Daewoo eventually dismantled its rig and Myanmar withdrew in the face of Dhaka's strong diplomatic protests. A 11-member Myanmar delegation, headed by Maung Myint, arrived in Dhaka Saturday to hold the talks. bdn
