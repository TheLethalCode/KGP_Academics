 PARIS, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Leaders Olympique Lyon tightened their grip on Ligue 1 with a 2-1 home win over Girondins Bordeaux on Sunday that moved them seven points clear at the top of the table. Goals by Ligue 1 top scorer Karim Benzema and Kim Kallstrom gave the seven-times champions 33 points from 14 games despite Bordeaux, now sixth on 24 points, dominating throughout but only scoring late through Fernando Cavenaghi. Second-placed Olympique Marseille stayed on 26 points after wasting a two-goal lead when they slumped to a 3-2 home defeat by Lorient on Saturday.

Sweden midfielder Kallstrom made it 2-0 soon after with a 38th-minute deflected shot from the edge of the area that looped over the head of goalkeeper Matthieu Valverde. Bordeaux resumed their domination after the break only for Brazilian Wendel to volley just wide from inside the box in the 52nd minute. Last season's runners-up finally found the back of the net when substitute Fernando Cavenaghi turned in a free-kick from Wendel to score his eight league goal nine minutes from time. "We gave Benzema some space only once and it made the difference. That was the turning point in the game," Bordeaux coach Laurent Blanc told French TV channel Canal Plus.
