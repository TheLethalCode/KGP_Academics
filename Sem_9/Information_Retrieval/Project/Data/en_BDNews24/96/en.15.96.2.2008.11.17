 BUENOS AIRES, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Boca Juniors missed a chance to go top of the Argentine standings when they suffered a shock 3-2 home defeat by Velez Sarsfield and champions River Plate won for the first time in 13 domestic games on Sunday.

Juan Forlin pulled one back, scoring from a rebound after Juan Roman Riquelme's free kick struck the underside of the crossbar in the 58th minute. But a superbly taken goal five minutes later by teenager Jonathan Cristaldo restored Velez's two-goal lead. Rodrigo Palacio pulled another back with six minutes left but it was not enough for Boca.
