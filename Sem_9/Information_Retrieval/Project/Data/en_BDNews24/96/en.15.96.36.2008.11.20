<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com)  The government has promised the first batch of 27th BCS qualifiers, who failed to pass in the second-round retakes, logical solutions on 'humanitarian grounds'. It has put up three possible ways to appoint them, including recruiting them in vacant posts, adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman told reporters on Thursday after a late-night meeting at the Dhaka University VC's residence. The second solution is to create new posts for them and the third is to allow them to sit for the 29th BCS examinations. Earlier in the day, Hossain Zillur persuaded a group of 'first batch' protestors, who had been on hunger strike for days, to break their fast on promise of government action. Giving them drinks, the education adviser said, "Some solutions are available and the most logical one will be adopted. Discussions on the matter are going on." Zillur said the government was searching for a formula to break the ice and "responsible steps will be taken". The education adviser was flanked by DU vice chancellor SMA Faiz, social sciences dean Dr Harun or Rashid, arts dean Dr Sadrul Amin and syndicate member Ahmed Kamal. From the spot, bdnews24.com correspondent Jannatul Ferdous said the adviser later went to the DU VC's residence to discuss the issue. The advisory council committee on administrative reforms and good governance on Nov 16 had been directed to formulate necessary recommendations with a view to eliminating the complexities centering on the 27th BCS exam results. The PSC originally posted an advertisement on June 28, 2005 for the 27th BCS exams. As many as 1,36,105 people applied and 1,18,339 took the exams. Of them, over 26,000 examinees passed written tests. The authorities recalled 16,418 for vivas. The PSC declared 3,567 candidates successful after the oral tests, asking authorities to appoint them. However, allegations of question leaks, politicisation, bribery and nepotism had marred the transparency of the 'first batch' results. The interim cabinet cancelled the viva results on May 30 2007, to "restore trust of the people in the Public Service Commission" and establish transparency in the wake of allegations of irregularities. The new results were published on Sept 23 after 16 months of dispute and legal wrangles. Some 10,412 examinees passed in the 'second batch' after new vivas were given. However, the government's decision to recall the original results triggered outrage among the first qualified batch, who had called for the removal of the PSC chairman and have held ongoing protests, including hunger strikes. bdnews24
