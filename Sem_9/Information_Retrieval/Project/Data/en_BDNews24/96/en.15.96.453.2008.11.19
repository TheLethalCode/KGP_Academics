 Bloemfontein, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com)  Centuries from captain Graeme Smith and Hashim Amla helped South Africa recover from a slow start to a commanding 299 for one at the close of the first day of the rain-hit first Test against Bangladesh at Outsurance Oval on Wednesday. They together put on 197 runs for the unbroken second wicket after opener Neil McKenzie fell to Shahadat Hossian for 42 off 118 balls. The left-handed Smith, who struck 232 against the same rivals in Chittagong early this year, led from the front with 138 off 222 balls, studded with 14 fours and one six, while Amal was 103 not out. The Bangladesh bowlers worked hard to keep the Proteas in check in the morning. The hosts could manage just 22 runs in the first hour in the face of some disciplined bowling from pace duo Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, who was a doubt for the match due to back pain, and Mahbubul Alam. The hosts went to lunch at 61 for no loss. The South African openers, who set a world-record opening partnership against Bangladesh in Chittagong, kept their cool and played no rash shots. They kept the run-wheel on a roll, putting up 102 runs for the first wicket. First-change bowler Shahadat Hossain drew the first blood having Neil McKenzie caught at backward point by Mehrab Hossain, but the lanky bowler struggled throughout to find his line and length to return one for 81 in his 14-over spell. Without key spinner Abdur Razzak, who arrived here in morning after having his suspected bowling action assessed in Australia, Ashraful kept hope on left-arm spinner Shakib Al Hasan, who bowled wicketless for 25 overs to concede 95 runs. Smith reached his fifty facing 92 balls and took another 85 balls to bring up his 17th century, sending Shakib Al Hasan over the mid-wicket for four. Amla from the beginning concentrated on quick runs that saw South Africa pick up 91 runs in the second session and 155 runs in the final session. The right-handed batsman consumed 76 balls to reach his fifty before striking left-arm spinner Mehrab for four straight down the ground to reach the sixth hundred off 149 balls. Amla smacked 10 fours in 154 balls. The Bangladesh captain tried his luck rotating six bowlers, but they had no impact on the left-right combination. bd
