 Dhaka, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com) Awami League wants no deferment of the Dec 18 parliamentary polls, a party spokesperson said Tuesday. "All political parties including the Awami League had welcomed the December 18 election date. We want the nation to exercise her franchise on the announced date," said Sheikh Hasina's special aide Dr Hasan Mahmud. Delegates from the US National Democratic Institute met with Awami League president Sheikh Hasina on Tuesday. Headed by former US congressman Sam Gejedenson, the delegation had a 45-minute meeting with the former premier at her Sudha Sadan home in Dhanmondi. The NDI delegation also included its regional director and NDI's Bangladesh director. The US-based non-government organisation claims to work towards strengthening democratic processes across the globe. AL advisory council member and former diplomat Faruque Chowdhury and Dr Hasan Mahmud were present at the meeting. After the meeting, Hasan Mahmud repeated AL's stance on no deferment of the election date. On the BNP chairperson's four demands, he said: "The nation cannot tarry on and on just because some spoilt party is behaving badly. We want the polls to take place on December 18." Asked if AL would be agreeable in case the polls dates are shifted, Mahmud repeated: "We simply don't want the election deferred at all." BNP chief Khaleda Zia on Monday gave the caretaker government 48 hours to meet four demands, including a fresh schedule enabling the hajj pilgrims to vote, for the four-party alliance to go to elections. On the four demands pressed by the alliance, AL advisory council member Faruque Chowdhury told reporters: "So many Bangladeshis live abroad, including thousands of peacekeepers deployed in more than one countries." "It has to be accepted that all citizens cannot participate in each and every national event." "We cannot hold the elections for all our citizens abroad to return home. Business as usual must go on." The Russian envoy also met with Hasina Tuesday before the NDI delegation. AL's Dhanmondi office, meanwhile, has been sending out nomination letters to candidates since Monday. Abdul Latif Siddiqui (Tangail-4), Dr Abdur Razzak (Tangail-1), Ahsan Hossain Titu (Tangail-6), Sahara Khatun (Dhaka-18), Benazir Ahmed (Dhaka-20), M Aman Ullah (Mymensingh-11) were among those who received nomination letters up to Tuesday morning. Some 155 letters went out Monday. AL finalised 290 nominations on Sunday before the party began sitting with alliance members on the issue of seat sharing. bdne
