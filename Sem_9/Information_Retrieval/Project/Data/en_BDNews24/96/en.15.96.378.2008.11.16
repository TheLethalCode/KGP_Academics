 Dhaka, Nov 16 (bdnews24.com)  The 14-party alliance on Sunday urged all political parties to join the general election on Dec. 18 that they said could not be delayed. "The election to the parliament must be held on December 18 as announced. The polls date cannot be shifted now," spokesperson and joint general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam of Awami league, that heads the combine, said. He briefed the media on the decisions of the meeting of the 14-party alliance presided over by Awami League president Sheikh Hasina. "The emergency has to go before the polls. The Upazila election schedule will have to be announced after the national polls are over. We at the 14-party alliance urge all the political parties in the country to take part in the elections." Rashed Khan Menon and Bimal Biswas of Workers Party of Bangladesh, Hasanul Huq Inu, Syed Jafar Sajjad and Shirin Akhter of Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (JDS-Inu), Enamul Haque of National Awami Party, Abdus Samad of Gano Azadi League, Asit Baran Roy of Communist Kendro, Zakir Hossain of Ganotantrik Majdoor Party, Nurul Islam of Ganotontree Party, Dilip Barua of Sammyabadi Dal (ML) and Amir Hossain Amu, Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed, Abdul Jalil, Suranjit SenGupta and Motia Chowdhury of Awami League were present at the two-and-a half-hour meeting at the AL president's political office in Dhanmandi. Ashraful said: "Through holding the elections, people's power has to be returned to the people. The people must stay united about holding the polls and transition of authority." Asked if Gano Forum is with the 14-party alliance, Ashraful said, "There are no doubts about GanoForum being a party; but confusions are there about a particular Gano Forum leader." Though Ashraful hinted that political parties had started discussing how they would share seats in the upcoming polls, he did not disclose anything about who was getting how many seats. Asked when the AL might finally announce the names of all 300 candidates, he said, "We hope the Awami League parliamentary board will finalise the 300 nominations today (Sunday)." bdnews
