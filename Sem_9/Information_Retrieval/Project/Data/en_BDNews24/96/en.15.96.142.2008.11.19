 Chittagong, Nov (bdnews24.com)  Awami League has picked nine old candidates and six new ones to run for 16 constituencies in Chittagong until Tuesday ahead of the parliamentary election slated for Dec. 18. Discontent ran deep among some leaders who failed to get nominations in four constituencies. Some of them are thinking of running for the election independently. "I will independently stand for the election," Mahfuzur Rahman Mita, son of late former lawmaker and AL leader Mostafizur Rahman from Chittagong-16 (Sandwip) told bdnews24.com. "I have got huge public support, but I have not been given the party nomination. So I will start electoral activities after going back to Sandwip [Wednesday]." Jamal Uddin Chowdhury has been chosen for the constituency. Chittagong district south leader and industrialist Jafar Ahmed failed to get nomination for Chittagong 14 (Satkania-Lohagora). He told bdnews24.com that he would contest the polls as an independent candidate. AKM Sirajul Islam, president of a pro-Awami lawyers' association, was picked for the constituency.
