 BAGHDAD, Sun Nov 16,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraq's cabinet approved a pact on Sunday allowing US troops to remain in the country for three more years, after months of painstaking negotiations with the United States. "The cabinet has just unanimously approved a deal between Iraq and the United States for the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq, with amendments from the American side," government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said. Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari told Reuters that the government now hopes to pass the agreement through parliament before the end of November, the final step toward enacting it. The agreement calls for US troops to withdraw from the streets of Iraq's towns and villages by the middle of next year, and to leave the country by the end of 2011. It was held up last month after Baghdad demanded last minute changes. "There have been compromises that satisfied the Iraqi side," Zebari said. "Now we have a deal that we can defend. It will be published and distributed and all neighbouring countries will have a copy of it.
