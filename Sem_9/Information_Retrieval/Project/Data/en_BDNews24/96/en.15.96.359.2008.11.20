<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com) The High Court ordered the government to allow Chittagong mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury to go to hajj. The High Court bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Kamrul Islam at the same time ordered the mayor, who was arrested on corruption charges but released on bail recently, to return after the pilgrimage. The court on Thursday stayed a government order refusing permission to Mohiuddin to go to Saudi Arabia for the religious ritual. It also issued a ruling against the government as to why such an order should not be declared illegal. "Mohiuddin will go to hajj on November 22 and come back on December 14," said Harishadhan Dev Brahman, one of the mayor's advocates. Mohiuddin was granted bail in the Bijoy TV corruption case on medical grounds on Sept 30 last. bdnew
