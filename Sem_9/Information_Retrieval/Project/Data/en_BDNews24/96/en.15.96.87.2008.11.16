<TEXT>
 PARIS, Nov 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Olympique Marseille threw away a two-goal lead as they lost 3-2 at home to Ligue 1 strugglers Lorient on Saturday. Marseille stay second with 26 points from 14 matches, four behind leaders Olympique Lyon, who host fourth-placed Girondins Bordeaux, with 24 points, on Sunday (2000 GMT). Erik Gerets's side looked set for a straightforward victory when Mamadou Niang added to Karim Ziani's first-half opener with a penalty on the hour but terrible defending cost them dear. Lorient scored three times in 14 minutes near the end. A bad clearance by the Marseille defence resulted in Morgan Amalfitano scoring from 20 metres in the 76th minute. Lorient continued to push forward and Fabrice Abriel equalised with a low 25-metre shot in the 84th after a swift counter-attack. Three minutes later, Abriel fed striker Kevin Gameiro with a defence-splitting pass and he scored to give Lorient the points. An early double by Andre-Pierre Gignac earned Toulouse a 2-0 home win over promoted Grenoble as the southwestern side moved up to third in the table one point behind Marseille. Steve Savidan celebrated his first call up to the France squad by scoring seven minutes into the second half as Caen snatched a 1-1 draw at Nancy. Striker Guillaume Hoarau, who joined Paris St Germain from Le Havre in the close season, hit a double against his former club as the team from the capital climbed two spots to sixth with 23 points following their 3-1 away win. Alain Perrin, who replaced sacked St Etienne coach Laurent Roussey earlier this week, could not prevent his new team losing 3-0 at Lille in his first match on the Les Verts bench. Lille, who are now fifth with 23 points, scored twice in the first half through 17-year-old Eden Hazard and Ludovic Obraniak. Slovak striker Robert Vittek added a third 20 minutes from times after St Etienne midfielder Blaise Matuidi was sent off for a second bookable offence four minutes after the break. St Etienne remain 18th in the 20-team league with 10 point
