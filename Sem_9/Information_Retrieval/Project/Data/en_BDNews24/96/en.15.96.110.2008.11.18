 Rangamati, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com)  The first-ever US-funded bilateral environmental programme in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) was rolled out on Tuesday. US ambassador James F Moriarty launched the programme styled Integrated Protected Area Co-management (IPAC) at a ceremony in the hills town. The five-year project at a cost $13 million will involve the local people in the integrated management of water bodies and protected forests, according to project documents. "IPAC will be the first-ever bilateral US government-supported programme in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. "In the past, we provided funding through the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and other partners," Moriarty said in his chief guest's address. "The IPAC is the combination of two projects, Mach and Nishorgo that we implemented in Bangladesh. "As a result of the success of the two projects, we need to combine the wetland and the protected areas. Because, the wetland needs to be protected," Denise Rollins, USAID's mission director, said to bdnews24.com. She said IPAC would save wetlands and protect the reserve forests in the hill areas. The USAID in 1998 funded 10-year programmes  Mach and Nishorgo  to protect environment through local people's participation. The USAID says the two programmes "very successful". Presided over by the Rangamati Hill District Council chairman Jagat Jyoti Chakma, the opening function was also addressed by CHT affairs secretary Sheikh Altaf Ali, chief conservator of forest A K M Shamsuddin and Rollins. bdnew
