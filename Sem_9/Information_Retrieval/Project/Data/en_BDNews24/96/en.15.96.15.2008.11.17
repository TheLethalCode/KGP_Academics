 Dhaka, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com)  Ekattorer Ghatak Dalal Nirmul Committee (The Committee for Elimination of Killers and Collaborators of 1971) on Monday has urged political parties not to nominate 'war criminals' as candidates in the general election. "We urge the political parties not to nominate the killers and collaborators of 1971, or fundamentalists, criminals and black money owners," Shahriar Kabir, acting president of the committee, said in a news conference at Dhaka Reporters Unity auditorium in the city. "The parties or the alliance nominating war criminals and fundamentalists will have to shoulder the consequences," he said, in a reference to the BNP-led four-party alliance that embodies Jamaat-e-Islami. Shahriar Kabir also urged the political parties to nominate candidates from among freedom fighters, women and religious minorities. The acting president revealed the committee's plan to launch a multidimensional campaign against the war criminals, religious fundamentalists and dishonest persons in order to bar them from getting ticket to the parliamentary polls by spreading black money or creating panic. Referring to the BNP-led alliance's move to delay the parliamentary election slated for Dec 18, Shahriar said, "By opposing the election schedule, they are not only opposing the country's march towards democracy but also hatching plots to prolong the current political crisis." "The government will be identified as traitors, if it fails hold the polls by December and the BNP-Jamaat alliance will be held responsible for the subsequent civil-war like situation in the country." The committee urged the young not to vote for BNP. Shahriar called on the government to publish a "white paper" on its successes and failures before handing over power to its successors. The committee has sent letters to a host of election monitors including the United Nations, Commonwealth, European Union, SAARC, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch to consider some constituencies the committee identified as "sensitive" during the 2001 parliamentary election, with extra care. bdnew
