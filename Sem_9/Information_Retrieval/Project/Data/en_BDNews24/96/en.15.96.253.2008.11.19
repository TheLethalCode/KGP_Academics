 Dhaka, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia met with leaders of the four-party alliance Wednesday as their 48-hour deadline to the government, to meet four demands, drew to a close. The hour-long meeting ended around 7pm on Wednesday at her Dhaka Cantonment residence, after which the leaders adjourned to the party chief's Gulshan office for further talks. Khaleda was expected to give a statement on their wrap up. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, standing committee member Dr Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan and central leader Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury, Jamaat-e-Islami ameer Motiur Rahman Nizami and secretary general Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mojaheed were present in the meeting. Khaleda gave the government 48 hours on Monday to meet four demands, including a fresh schedule, for the four-party alliance to go to elections. BNP and its allies have called for total withdrawal of the state of emergency and re-announcement of the election schedule for the sake of pilgrims who are now in Saudi Arabia to perform hajj. Repeal of section 91E of the Representation of the People Ordinance that gives the Election Commission power to cancel candidacy, and deferment of Upazila polls are the other two demands. bdnews24
