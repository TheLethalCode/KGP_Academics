<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia gave the government 48 hours on Monday to meet four demands, including a fresh schedule, for the four-party alliance to go to elections. BNP and its allies have called for total withdrawal of the state of emergency and re-announcement of the election schedule for the sake of pilgrims who are now in Saudi Arabia to perform hajj. Amendment to section 91E of the Representative of the People Ordinance that gives the Election Commission power to cancel candidacy, and deferment of Upazila polls are the other two demands. "We are dropping the other demands off our earlier seven-point charter, as we want to contest in the election. We hope now the government, showing its good intentions, will create a congenial atmosphere for the election," she said. Khaleda aired the demands at a press conference at 9:15pm, after a 10-minute meeting of BNP and its allies on their election stance. Immediately before the alliance meeting, Khaleda chaired a meeting of BNP's national standing committee with the same agenda. She called for a clear statement from the government on the alliance's demands within the stipulated time. "Otherwise the Election Commission and the government will be held responsible for the unstable situation regarding the election." The other demands of the alliance's seven-point charter, originally tabled in dialogue with the government, had included release of BNP leaders from jail, withdrawal of cases against them and creating 'a level playing field' for the election. "Announcement of the election on December 18 without any kind of preparation is nothing but cheating with the state," said Khaleda. "The Election Commission and the government are yet to complete their electoral preparation, while the people are in a maze about the newly demarcated constituencies," Khaleda alleged. She said the national voter list was yet to reach all the areas. She, however, thanked the armed forces for their work on the massive project. The former prime minister said the caretaker government had failed to create a favourable environment for the election in its two years in office. No such "chaotic situation" would have erupted if initiatives were taken on time, she observed. "We had placed our seven-point demand much earlier, but no attention was paid to it." BNP secretary general Khandakar Delwar Hossain and senior leaders M Saifur Rahman and ASM Hannan Shah, Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed and assistant secretary general Quamaruzzaman attended the press briefing. bdnews
