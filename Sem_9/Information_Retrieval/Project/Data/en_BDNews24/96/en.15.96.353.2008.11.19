 Dhaka, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com)  The health secretary has warned government doctors against private practice during office hours. AMM Nasiruddin said strict measures would be taken if such charges are supported by evidence. As many as 104 government doctors have been punished, he said during a meeting with the Anticorruption Commission officials. Nasiruddin said his ministry would take steps to ensure that a person did not have to spend money to get pension. "We have found evidence of gross corruption in 12 areas of the health sector and two of them are severely affected by irregularities," said Hassan Mashhud Chowdhury, chairman of the Anticorruption Commission. "Authorities have been urged to find and address the causes of irregularities in these sectors." He said 40 points of administrative anomalies came up in the discussion and a proposal would soon be made. "Officials of the ministries have already taken steps to rectify those and we hope in certain cases they will go to the field level to carry out a thorough cleansing process." He also stressed on the involvement of the general people in battling corruption. b
