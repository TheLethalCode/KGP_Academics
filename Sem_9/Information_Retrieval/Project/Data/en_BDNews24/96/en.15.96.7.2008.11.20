<TITLE> Japanese missile defense test fails off Hawaii </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Japanese naval destroyer failed to intercept a dummy ballistic missile in a test aimed at mimicking an intermediate-range North Korean ballistic missile attack, the United States and Japan announced on Wednesday. "There is no immediate explanation for the failed intercept attempt," military officials from both countries said in a joint statement. The test took place in Hawaiian waters and involved the Chokai, the second Japanese Kongo-class ship to be outfitted for missile defense. North Korea's test-firing of a ballistic missile over Japan in August 1998 spurred Tokyo to become the most active US ally in building a layered shield against missiles that could be tipped with chemical, biological or nuclear warheads. The drill off Kauai, Hawaii, used the ship-borne Aegis ballistic missile defense system made by Lockheed Martin Corp and a Standard Missile-3 Block 1A missile, built by Raytheon Co. The Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency, which staged the event in cooperation with Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Forces, called it a "No Notice" test, more challenging than the first of its kind for a Japanese ship in 2007. To make it more realistic, the time of the target's launch from a range on Kauai was not disclosed to any participants, the Pentagon said in a "fact sheet." In December 2003, Japan decided to equip its four Kongo-class destroyers with Aegis ballistic missile defense systems at a cost of $246.1 million. Each installation was to be followed by a test intercept. The Kongo, the first to be upgraded, completed its flight test in December 2007
