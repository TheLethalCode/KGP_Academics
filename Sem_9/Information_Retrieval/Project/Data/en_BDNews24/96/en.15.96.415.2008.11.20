 LUANDA, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Congolese President Joseph Kabila will discuss the conflict in his country with Angola's president on Friday as a pullback by rebel fighters raises hopes for peace talks to end the violence in eastern Congo. "President Kabila will meet with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos on Friday as part of a series of visits to leaders in the region," an Angolan foreign ministry spokesman said on Thursday. The Democratic Republic of Congo recently asked Angola for political and military support after renegade Tutsi general, Laurent Nkunda, and his troops advanced on the North Kivu provincial capital Goma. But the Angolan government, which has one of sub-Saharan Africa's biggest armies and backed the Congolese government in the 1998-2003 war, has repeatedly said it would not interfere directly in the conflict. Hundreds of Congolese rebel fighters pulled back on Wednesday from frontline positions in a move UN peacekeepers hoped would open the way for talks on ending weeks of conflict. UN foot and air patrols were monitoring the withdrawal of Nkunda's Tutsi rebels from positions they had occupied after a rapid advance northwards in eastern North Kivu province
