 NEW DELHI, Wed Nov 19, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Indian warship deployed in the Gulf of Aden fought Somali pirates and destroyed their vessel after a brief battle, the navy said on Wednesday. Two accompanying speed boats sped away after the main vessel was blown up late on Tuesday. "INS Tabar retaliated in self defence and opened fire on the mother vessel," the navy said in a statement. "As a result of the firing by INS Tabar, fire broke out on the vessel and explosions were heard, possibly due to exploding ammunition that was stored on the vessel." Naval oficers on board the warship said they spotted pirates moving on the deck with rocket propelled grenade launchers. "On repeated calls, the vessel's threatening response was that she would blow up the naval warship," the navy said. India deployed INS Tabar, a naval warship, to escort Indian ships after the country's shipping firms said they were losing $450,000 a month on cost overruns and delays in meeting deadlines. Crew members are reluctant to sail in the Gulf of Aden, one of the world's most important sea trade routes, fearing attacks by pirates
