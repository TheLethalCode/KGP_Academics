 Dhaka, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has given a fresh set of dates for nominations and withdrawal of candidacy for the second time since the original schedule for the Dec. 18 general election was announced in early November. The chief election commissioner said on Wednesday that the nomination deadline for parliamentary and Upazila elections had been pushed back three days to Nov. 23. It has also pushed back the deadline for cancellation of candidacy to Dec 1 for the general elections and Dec. 4 for Upazila polls, EC secretary Humayun Kabir said on Thursday. The commission has set Nov. 25 and 26 for the scrutiny of nomination papers for the national elections and Nov. 27-29 for Upazila, Kabir said. "The changes have been made in line with the commission's decision keeping the elections dates unchanged," he said at a press briefing at the EC Secretariat after a meeting of the CEC and two fellow commissioners. "We have changed the schedule considering the requirement of prospective nominees in submitting their nomination papers," he said. The secretary did not make any comment while asked if the EC still had any plan to defer the parliamentary election date to Dec. 28 if the political parties agreed. The original schedule for national elections on Dec. 18 and Upazila Parishad polls on Dec. 28 was announced by CEC ATM Shamsul Huda on Nov. 2. According to the original schedule, the last date for submission of nomination papers for the parliamentary polls was Nov. 13. Scrutiny of the nomination papers was on Nov. 16 and 17 and the last date for withdrawal of the candidature was Nov. 24. The first change, keeping the election dates the same, was brought on Nov. 9. The EC had extended the deadline for submission of nomination papers to Nov. 20 for both national and Upazila polls.
