 MUMBAI, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  The BSE Sensex fell as much as 4.1 percent on Monday after Japan joined the list of economies in recession and a meeting of global leaders failed to throw up concrete measures to stem the crisis. Banks such as ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank led the fall as investors fretted a weakening economy would raise defaults, and largest listed firm Reliance Industries fell 4.3 percent to 1,098.35 rupees on concerns of a global slowdown would hit demand for petrochemicals, traders said. "Sentiment is negative overall with Japan also entering the recession zone. Closer to home things don't look too bright as well," said Amitabh Chakraborthy, president for equities at Religare Securities. At 11:14 a.m., the 30-share BSE index was down 3.4 percent at 9,058.53, with all stocks losing ground. It later extended losses to 4.1 percent, with the market at its lowest since Oct. 29. The index is down 56 percent in 2008. ICICI Bank fell 7.1 percent to 368 rupees, HDFC Bank slipped 7.8 percent to 933 rupees and top mortgage lender Housing Development Finance Corp weakened 5.5 percent to 1,472 rupees. Top construction and engineering firm Larsen & Toubro fell 4 percent to 759.90 rupees as investors expected orders to slow down. "Concerns over a fast-contracting global economy and deteriorating macro situation will continue to keep bulls on tenterhooks," India Infoline said in a research note. Many economists expect Indian economic growth to slow to 7 percent or less in the year to March 2009, sharply slower than the rates of 9 percent and higher clocked up in the past three fiscal years. Policy makers from both emerging and developed economies who met in Washington over the weekend chose to leave individual governments to tend their own backyards. In the broader market, losers outnumbered gainers by almost 4:1 on volumes of 77.4 million shares. The 50-share NSE index was down 3.3 percent at 2,717.05. STOCKS ON THE MOVE Kingfisher Airlines rose 11.4 percent to 29.40 rupees after it said it had received several expressions of interest from foreign airlines and had asked the government to allow foreign ownership of up to 25 percent. Textile maker Himatsigka Seide rose 1.8 percent to 28.70 after it said it has resolved a dispute on a foreign exchange derivative contract by paying 92.3 million rupees.
