 Dhaka, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has collected lists of hajj pilgrims from the religious affairs ministry, an official said on Tuesday, after an ultimatum from the four-party alliance that included rescheduling the election to allow pilgrims now in Saudi Arabia to vote. "The commission has sought the list of this year's hajj pilgrims from us and we have provided them with necessary information to that end," joint secretary Afzal Hossain told bdnews24.com. The EC sat in a meeting at around 12:30 pm. BNP and its allies gave the government 48 hours on Monday to meet four conditions, three of their previous seven along with inclusion of the new demand to ensure voting by pilgrims who are performing hajj this year. Hajj will be held on or around Dec 8 following sighting of the moon. Hajj officer Bazlul Haque Biswas said 48,876 were performing hajj this year. The last two hajj flights to Saudi Arabia, by Biman Bangladesh Airlines and Saudi Airlines, are set to leave on Dec 2 and 4. The return flights are scheduled from Dec 13 to Jan 2. The general election has been announced for Dec 18. bdnews
