 Dhaka, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com) - Five advisers met BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia for an hour and a half on Tuesday evening, to discuss the four-party's demands for the alliance to join the general election. Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury, communications adviser Ghulam Quader, law adviser AF Hassan Ariff, local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal and commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman were at Khaleda's Gulshan office at from around 6.45 to 8.15pm. "The advisers sought the appointment to meet [Khaleda]," the chief of Khaleda's information cell Faruq Kamal Khan Sohel said prior to the meeting. The talks come after chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda and fellow election commissioners met with chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed at his office Tuesday afternoon, in the wake of the four-party's ultimatum Khaleda had issued on Monday The BNP-led four-party alliance gave the government 48 hours to meet their four conditions, including a new schedule, on which they would take part in the general election. Election Commission officials said that Huda met with Fakhruddin Tuesday to discuss with the interim government head whether the polls could be rescheduled. BNP and its allies have called for total withdrawal of the state of emergency and re-announcement of the election schedule for the sake of pilgrims who are now in Saudi Arabia to perform hajj. Changes to section 91E of the Representation of the People Ordinance 2008 that gives the Election Commission power to cancel candidacy, and deferment of Upazila polls are the other two demands. Rival party Awami League and its allies have said they are against any deferral of the election date. bdnews
