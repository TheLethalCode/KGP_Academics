<TITLE> UN peacekeepers needed in Somalia: African Union </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MOGADISHU, Thu Nov 20,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United Nations should send peacekeepers to Somalia urgently to stop the strife that is fuelling piracy and is being aggravated by feuding politicians, the African Union's top diplomat said on Thursday. Gunmen from the chaotic Horn of Africa country grabbed world headlines with Saturday's spectacular capture of a huge Saudi Arabian supertanker loaded with $100 million worth of oil, the biggest ship hijacking in history. Jean Ping, chairman of the African Union Commission, said the increasing piracy was "a clear indication of the further deterioration of the situation with far-reaching consequences for this country, the region and ... international community." The scores of attacks in Somali waters this year have driven up insurance costs for shipping firms, and even made some companies divert cargo around South Africa's Cape of Good Hope. Norway's Frontline, one of the world's biggest oil tanker owners, said on Thursday it was "definitely considering" avoiding the Gulf of Aden and the Suez Canal because of piracy. Shipping firm A.P. Moller-Maersk said it was re-routing some of its huge merchant fleet to avoid the Gulf of Aden and sail round southern Africa to avoid the risk of attack by pirates. It said the decision would mainly affect its oil tanker fleet. Forces from NATO, the European Union and elsewhere are trying to protect vessels on one of the world's busiest shipping routes, linking Europe to Asia, but many analysts say there can be no lasting end to the piracy without peace on land. Experts say pessimism over the outlook for Somalia's peace talks, memories of disastrous interventions in the past and the need to deal with emergencies elsewhere have snuffed out the will to deal with the chaotic country's deep-seated problems. NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said on Thursday the transatlantic alliance would continue to patrol the seas, but rejected calls from Moscow for international forces to attack the pirates' land bases. "Piracy is a very serious challenge and we have to fight it, but I think if you come to the part of these operations, for instance on land, then it is first and foremost up to the United Nations and not organizations like NATO to get deeply involved," he told reporters during a visit to Ghana. Diplomats say there is little hope of any speedy U.N. intervention. At an emergency meeting on piracy in Cairo, an Egyptian government spokesman said African countries were also unable to deal with the attacks and needed foreign intervention. POLITICAL RIFTS There were also signs on Thursday of a worsening rift at the top of Somalia's Western-backed Transitional Federal Government, which regional leaders say is hindering the peace process. Prime Minister Nur Hassan Hussein told a news conference in Mogadishu that he disagreed with a request by President Abdullahi Yusuf to shift peace talks to Libya from Djibouti, saying it would undermine the U.N.-brokered process. In an interview with Reuters this week, Hussein said Yusuf was an "obstacle" to progress. Hussein also said he was prepared to include the hardline Islamist group al Shabaab, which controls most of south Somalia, in talks "if they give up their deeds and attitude." While Washington is wary of including Islamists in any power-sharing government, some analysts say appealing to moderates -- and isolating a rump of hardliners who are imposing a strict form of Islamic law -- could be a way forward. Since seizing the supertanker Sirius Star, pirates have hijacked at least three other ships, maritime officials say. The tanker's owners are in ransom talks, but Britain said on Thursday that rewarding the gunmen could create more problems. The audacity of the attack underlined the extent of a crime wave that experts say has been fueled by the Iraq-style Islamist insurgency onshore and the lure of multi-million-dollar ransoms
