 Dhaka, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com)  Hearings on 25 elections monitoring agencies will be held at the Election Commission on Nov 23 and 24. Official in charge at the EC secretariat SM Asaduzzaman told reporters on Tuesday: "The commission will hear both parties and then decide if the observers against which objections have been raised will be registered." Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda and commissioners M Sakhawat Hussain and Muhammed Sohul Hussain would be present to hear the parties, he said. The Awami League lodged complaints against 20 applicants and the BNP against four for being "partisan". Both parties objected to registering Coast Trust. AL and BNP submitted their objections to the EC on Sunday. Asaduzzaman said the 20 agencies AL objected to include BCDJC, Democracy Watch, FEMA, Jagoroni Chakra, Khan Foundation, Light House, Noakhali Rural Development Society, Shariyatpur Development Society, Srijoni, Bangladesh Manabadhikar (Human Rights) Commission, AMUAB, Hilful Fuzul Samaj Kallyan Sangstha, National Youth Forum Bangladesh, Jugayan Samajik Unnayan Sangstha, Unity of Social Advantage, Brave, Coast Trust, Development Organisation for the Poor, Nari Udyog Kendra and ANFRIL. The four agencies on BNP's complaint list are Coast Trust, Broti, ID and Bangladesh Manabadhikar Samannay Parishad (Human Rights Coordination Council), he added. Objections against Solidarity (Kurigram) and Abad Pukur Palli Samaj Unnayan Sangstha (Naogaon) were also registered locally, the official said. The EC primarily listed 138 organisations for registration as election observers, inviting objections against them, if any, to reach the commission by Nov 16 (Sunday). Some 319 agencies applied for registration as election observers with some having already been screened out on grounds of non-compliance with the EC rules, Asaduzzaman said. bd
