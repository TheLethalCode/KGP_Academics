 JAKARTA, Tue Nov 18, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indonesia's graft agency signed an agreement on Tuesday with the FBI to cooperate in the fight against corruption, officials said. Antasari Azhar, chairman of Indonesia's Corruption Eradication Commission, known as the KPK, said the agreement covered exchange of information on training and investigating cases of corruption. "After the signing of this memorandum of understanding, FBI and KPK are like relatives in law enforcement, especially in the global war against corruption," Azhar said after signing the agreement. John Pistole, US Federal Bureau of Investigation Deputy Director, said the agreement would allow the agencies to help each other investigate cases involving bribery money in Indonesia that may have been hidden in the United States. Indonesia is often ranked as one of the most corrupt countries in the world, but during President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's presidency several high-ranking officials have been jailed for graft. The KPK, which began operations in 2003, has already started to acquire something of a cult status.

As part of the crackdown, KPK has detained officials from the central bank, the attorney-general's office, parliament and customs department
