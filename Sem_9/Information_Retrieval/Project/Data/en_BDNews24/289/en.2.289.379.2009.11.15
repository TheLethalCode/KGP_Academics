<TITLE> Speaker proposes duty-free cars for MPs again </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)--Speaker Abdul Hamid says the government has been approached to allow MPs to import duty-free cars on condition that those would not be luxury cars and cannot be sold before seven years. The MPs, however, cannot buy luxury cars like Lexus, Mercedes-Benz or Hummer, Hamid told reporters after attending a discussion at the CIRDAP auditorium on Sunday. He said the recommendation was sent to the prime minister and if approved,the MPs will be able to import cars between 1500 and 3000 CC. The MPs had long been criticised for abusing the scope by selling these imported duty-free cars. The 2007-08 military-installed caretaker government repealed the provision, introduced by military strongman H M Ershad's government, through an ordinance. The ordinance has not been made into a law by the ruling Awami League-led government. The parliament secretariat at a meeting in June decided to buy cars for the MPs. But, Hamid proposed the import as the decision had not been implemented, he said. "There are lots of hassles including tenders if the parliament secretariat goes for buying new cars, while importing duty-free cars will save a lot of money," he added. Hamid said he also recommended increase in salaries and allowances for the MPs in the wake of the recent pay hile for civil servants. bdn
