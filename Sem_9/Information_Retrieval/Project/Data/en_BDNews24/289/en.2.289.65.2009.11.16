<TITLE> Man-made ponds linked to arsenic in Bangladesh water </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 HONG KONG, Nov 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Man-made ponds and rice fields irrigated using groundwater may be responsible for arsenic contamination of groundwater in Bangladesh, a study has found. Arsenic is a naturally occurring chemical poisonous to humans and is known to cause skin lesions and cancers of the bladder, kidney, lung and skin. While it is known that organic carbon triggers the release of arsenic from sediments into groundwater, the source of this carbon has been unclear. In a paper published in Nature Geoscience, researchers said they used chemical tests and models to examine the flow of groundwater in a typical agricultural area in Bangladesh and found that man-made ponds were a key source of organic carbon. "The chemical signature of high-arsenic groundwater points towards ponds as the source of the contaminated water," wrote the scientists, led by Charles Harvey from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States. They warned against the building of artificial ponds above existing tube wells. "The development of artificial ponds above wells should be avoided if it is possible, and drinking-water wells should not be placed downstream of recharge from existing ponds, wetlands, rivers or other permanently saturated water bodies potentially elevated in organic carbon," they wrote. Hundreds of thousands of people in Bangladesh suffer from skin lesions and experts have warned for years that Bangladesh can expect more cases of cancer if its people continue drinking arsenic-contaminated water from millions of small tube wells spread across the countryside. Ironically, the tube wells were installed from the 1970s with the help of international agencies like the United Nations Children's Fund to provide "clean water" and as an answer to dirty surface water and widespread gastrointestinal diseases. Arsenic contamination of ground water has been found in other countries, including Argentina, Chile, China, India, Mexico, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States, and is a global problem. But Bangladesh's plight is unprecedented and some experts have described it as the largest mass poisoning of a population in history. According to the World Health Organisation, arsenic contaminated water directly affects the health of 35 million people in Bangladesh, which has a total population of 130 million. Arsenic is widely distributed throughout the earth's crust and is introduced into water through the dissolution of minerals and ores. There should not be more than 0.01 milligrams/litre of the chemical in drinking water, according to the
