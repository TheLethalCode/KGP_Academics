 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)Two more alleged extremists were killed on Sunday in so-called gunfights with law-enforcers in Kushtia and Jhenaidah. Mamun-ur-Rashid alias Mamun, 38, son of Rezaul Karim of Akbarpur village in Gangni Upazila, was a regional leader of the banned Purba Banglar Communist Party ( ML-Janajuddha), said Daulatpur Police Station officer in-charge Hasan Hafizur Rahman. Mamun, who faced 12 cases including two for murders, was killed at around 4am at Panch Pirtala village in Khalikundi Union. OC Rahman said a police team raided the Aam Bagan area in Panch Pittala village on a tip-off about a secret meeting of the group. Sensing the presence of the law enforcers the criminals opened fire, forcing the police team to retaliate, he claimed. Everyone in the gang except Mamun, who was shot dead at one stage of the shootout, escaped the raid, he said. Police retrieved two guns, five rounds of ammunition and a sharp weapon on the spot. Mamun's dead body has been sent to the Kushtia Sadar Hospital for an autopsy. During the last three months, a total of 28 people were killed in the so-called 'gunfights' between alleged extremists and law enforcers in Kushtia. In Jhenaidah, a Biplobi Communist Party member, Aminul Islam Manik, was killed at around 1am in an 'encounter'.
