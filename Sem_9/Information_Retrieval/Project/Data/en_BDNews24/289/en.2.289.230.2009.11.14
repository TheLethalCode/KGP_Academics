 Liton Haider bdnews24.com. senior correspondent Dhaka, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com)  The target for swelling police ranks by 32,000 over three years looks uncertain, as the first recruitment phase is falling critically short, officials say. The recruitment process is supposed to be completed in three phases over three years. But less than half the first phase target has been met with just one and a half months to the end of the year. "Around 4,000 have been recruited in the first ten months this year," home secretary Abdus Sobhan Shikdar told bdnews24.com this week. The target is just under 9,000 for the year. Despite this, the home secretary was optimistic. "The drive will persist, and it is still possible to recruit 32,000 personnel by the end of 2011." Prime minister Sheikh Hasina initially declared that her government, coming to power in January this year, would add 30,000 to the long-overstretched Bangladesh Police force. The home secretary said Bangladesh Police Headquarters later approached the ministry with a greater requirement of 32,000looking for almost half, just under 16,000, to be of police constable rank. According to police headquarters, the ministry planned to recruit 8,946 personnel during the first phase up to the end of this year. Another 13,082 were to be added in 2010, and another 10,003 in the final recruitment phase throughout 2011. Some important proposals also came under the plan's first phase, including the launch of specialised Industrial Police and Naval Police forces, a National Bureau for Counter Terrorism and a Bureau of Crisis Response and Protection for security of VVIPs. A high ranking police official said many of these plans had been "file-locked", one in the Secretary Committee, others in the finance ministry, establishment ministry, or home ministry. Questioned about these "pending proposals" in the ministries, Shikdar said: "The prime minister's priority is to increase numbers in the police force." He said the concerned ministries "were working on" the other proposals. The plan for new police personnel includes creation of 10 new inspector general (IG) posts, three at Police Headquarters and seven others for Dhaka Metropolitan Police, the Special Branch, the Criminal Investigation Department, Police Telecom, the Armed Police Battalion and the two newly proposed bodiesthe National Bureau for Counter Terrorism and the Bureau of Crisis Response and Protection. The first phase was to see the posting of one new inspector general, the second and third phases respectively to see the posting of four and five new inspectors general. bdnews24.com
