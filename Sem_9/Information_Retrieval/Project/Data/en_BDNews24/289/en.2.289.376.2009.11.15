<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)Representatives of around 200 boatmen from Basila and Waaspur on the Buriganga river, threatened with losing their livelihood due to construction of the third Buriganga Bridge, submitted a petition to the prime minister Sunday. They urged her to support their rehabilitation. The boatmen said that they had earned their living for generations ferrying millions of people and goods across the Buriganga river at Basila and Waaspur Ghats. With the inauguration of the third Buriganga Bridge they are set to lose their livelihoods. "We are a poor, illiterate community without many skills other than rowing boats. As soon as the bridge is opened for the public, we shall face starvation and extreme uncertainty," they said in the petition, signed by nearly 200 boatmen. They boatmen point out, in the past, rehabilitation programmes compensated for similar livelihoods lost after the construction of the first Buriganga Bridge, the Jamuna Bridge and Kanchpur Bridge over the Sitalakha, for example. Compensation and rehabilitation for lands and livelihoods lost accounted for a major part of the cost of the Jamuna Bridge, now renamed the Bangabandhu Bridge. The petition was submitted to the Prime Minister's Office at Nakhalp
