<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)--The High Court has asked the government to explain why it will not declare as unlawful and contrary to the constitution the judicial power vested in executive magistrates by amending the Criminal Procedure Code. The bench of justices Syed Rifaat Ahmed and Mainul Islam Chowdhury issued the rule on Sunday in response to a writ petition filed by three Supreme Court lawyers. Asaduzzaman Siddiqi, Sarwar Ahmed Chawdhury and Eklas Uddin Bhuiyan filed the plea on behalf of the Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh. The cabinet secretary, president's secretary, law secretary and parliament secretary have been asked to reply to the ruling in the next three weeks. Manjil Morshed, lawyer for the petitioners, said the judiciary was separated from the administration following a verdict of the Appellate Division. It is unlawful and contrary to the constitution to give judicial powers to executive magistracy. Executive magistrates were given judicial powers after the amendment of the Criminal Procedure Code on April 8, he added. Earlier on Nov 13, Morshed served a legal notice on the four sectaries to withdraw the amendment. bdnews
