<TEXT>
 Chandpur, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com)  Police recovered two "bomb-like" packages from Chandpur Railway Station Wednesday. An official said they could not be sure if they were bombs, but security had been beefed at the station and the town after the event. Chandpur police super Krishnapad Roy told reporters the packages were found under a bench in front of the station's ticket counter at around 10am. He said there were "electric wires coming out at the front and back", which made police suspect that they might be bombs. The objects were taken to Chandpur Police Lane and the army's bomb experts were informed. A RAB team from Comilla also went to the spot at around 11am. RAB-11 officer Sgt Md Rafiqul Islam said, "We are not sure yet whether they are really bombs." Police took three witnesses to Chandpur Model Police Station to question them in connection with the suspected bombs. Qazi Qyaium, Chandpur Model Police Station chief, quoting one witness, said a man named 'Laengra Jalal' left the polythene-wrapped packages at the station in the morning but he could not be found later. Police super Roy said: "Security has been tightened in Chandpur town after recovery of the bomb-like materials. Additional police have been deployed at all the important installations." He said police had already taken extra security measures ahead of the final verdict of Bangabandhu murder trial on Thursday. bdn
