 DOHA, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester City's Brazil forward Robinho said on Friday he was happy at the club despite speculation linking him with a move to Barcelona. "I am so happy at my club. People talk a lot but the truth is I'm trying to play again," said at a news conference ahead of Brazil's friendly with England in Qatar. Earlier on Friday, City manager Mark Hughes warned Brazil against playing his recovering forward in the match. Robinho, who has not played since suffering an ankle injury in a 3-1 win over Argentina on Sept 5, joined up with the Brazil squad in Doha with the Premier League side's approval. "They felt they wanted him to be involved in the squad and... the decision was made he could stay with them under the proviso he doesn't take any part in the game," Hughes said after City lost 1-0 to a young UAE side in Abu Dhabi on Thursday. Robinho told Friday's news conference: "I don't want to be in the middle of a row between City and Brazil. My obligation is to be here and that is supported by FIFA. "I came here to look after myself (medically), to be with (the Brazil doctor) Jose Luis Runca." Hughes added on City's website (www.mcfc.co.uk): "He (Robinho) has had one training session in eight to 10 weeks, so to actually think he could be ready for a full international against England would, I suggest, be foolhardy. "He may benefit from training with the quality of the squad Brazil has but frankly we would be disappointed if he played in a full international because he would compromise hims
