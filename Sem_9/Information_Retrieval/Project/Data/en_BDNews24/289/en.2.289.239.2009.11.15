<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)Commercial banks are still reluctant to deal with small and medium enterprises, based on misapprehensions, according to the SME Foundation chief. "The common misunderstanding is that the SMEs might fail to pay back loans," Aftab ul Islam, chairman of the SME Foundation told a meeting with a delegation of Chittagong Women Chamber of Commerce and Industry on Sunday Lack of capital and poor access to private sector loans are serious constraints for small and medium start-ups. "The number of small entrepreneurs without access to credit is large," said Islam. He told the delegation that they were trying to arrange funds from other sources and start a credit wholesaling programme in full force. "There will be an SME financing fair on December 8," the chairman said He also reiterated plans to set up a specialised SME bank to facilitate low-interest loans on easy terms. Small and medium entrepreneurs also suffer other common constraints such as difficulties in procuring raw materials, lack of access to relevant business information, low technological capabilities, bureaucratic tangles, and regulations that generate market distortions, Islam told the meeting. CWCCI president Monowara Hakim Ali called for more support and services from the SME Foundation for women entrepreneurs. "The majority of our small and medium entrepreneurs are women, belonging to the lower middle class...but cannot get funding from commercial banks due to their inability to provide collateral," she said. Momtaz Uddin Ahmed, managing director of the SME Foundation, told the meeting that a key to economic progress for both developing and developed nations was fostering the growth of SMEs.
