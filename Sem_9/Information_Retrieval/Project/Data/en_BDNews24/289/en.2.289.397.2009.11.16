 ZURICH, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Argentina coach Diego Maradona has been given a two-month ban and fined over $24,000 following his globally-broadcast foul-mouthed outburst at the end of last month's decisive World Cup qualifier in Uruguay. Maradona, who as a player was kicked out of the 1994 World Cup for a doping offence, was handed the ban by FIFA's disciplinary committee on Sunday. Soccer's governing body said in a statement: "The FIFA disciplinary committee...decided today to impose a two-month ban on taking part in any football related activity and a 25,000 CHF ($24,630) fine on the head coach of Argentina Diego Maradona, in relation to the disciplinary proceedings related to the incidents following the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying match between Uruguay and Argentina played on Oct 14, 2009 in Montevideo." The statement added: "The committee took into consideration the apologies and the sincere remorse shown by Maradona in its decision, which was communicated to him at the end of the meeting." Maradona flew from Madrid, where his side lost 2-1 to Spain in a friendly on Saturday, to Zurich to appear before the tribunal in person. Maradona rounded on his critics after Argentina beat arch-rivals Uruguay 1-0 in Montevideo in October to secure their berth in the South Africa in the last game of an 18-match qualifying campaign. ANOTHER OUTBURST He launched into an expletive-filled rant when interviewed on the touchline and produced another outburst in the post-match media conference, which was broadcast live on several television networks. The 1986 World Cup winner had been heavily criticised for defeats against Bolivia, Ecuador, Brazil and Paraguay that left twice world champions Argentina on the brink of failing to reach the World Cup for the first time since 1970. Appointed in October last year, Maradona's coaching credential have been repeatedly questioned. He has called up more than 70 players for 14 matches -- eight qualifiers and six friendlies -- and been criticised for his team selections. The Argentina Football Association (AFA) had told FIFA in a report: "Maradona was acting in a state of violent emotion over arguments with journalists in the days before the match." Maradona's tenure has been marked by clashes with players, coaches, journalists and directors since he took charge midway through the qualifiers in Oct. 2008 following the resignation of Alfio Basile. The controversy began less than one week after he took over when a row over the AFA's refusal to let him appoint former captain Oscar Ruggeri as assistant coach led to speculation that he could quit. Playmaker Juan Roman Riquelme, a central figure at the 2006 World Cup and for Basile in the 2010 qualifiers, quit saying Maradona did not live by "the same codes". Maradona has also had differences with 1986 World Cup-winning coach Carlos Bilardo, who was appointed the AFA's technical director of national teams. Bilardo appeared to have been named as someone whom Maradona could turn to for support but the coach has said he will make all the decisions and the older man should "stay up in the directors' box in suit and tie" with AFA president Julio Gron
