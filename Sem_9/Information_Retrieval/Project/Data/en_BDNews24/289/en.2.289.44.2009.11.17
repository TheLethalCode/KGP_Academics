 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com)--Bangladesh railway authorities will launch a new intercity train on Nov 23 between Dhaka and Rajshahi. The new train, named the Dhumketu Express, will start from Rajshahi station at 11.15 pm and reach Kamalapur at 4.40 am, railway's chief operating superintendent (west zone) M A Wahab told bdnews24.com Tuesday. He said the train would subsequently leave Dhaka at 5.35am on Nov 24 and reach Rajshahi at 11.05 am. The minimum fare has been fixed at Tk 165, said Wahab. "Besides, the 798-seated train will have air conditioned coaches which include AC-berth and AC-chair," he said. "We are launching the train ahead of Eid; it will ply six days a week round the year," Quazi Asadullah, railway's additional director general (operations), told bdnews24.com at Railway Bhaban. According to the final schedule, the train will not run from Rajshahi on Mondays or from Dhaka on Tuesdays. With the introduction of the Dhumketu Express, the number of intercity trains on the Dhaka-Rajshahi-Dhaka route will stand at three. The Silk City and the Padma Express are the other two, which can carry 1600 passengers everyday. Railway officials say the Dhaka-bound train will stop at seven stations: Abdulpur Natore), Chatmohor (Pabna), Baral bridge (Pabna), Sadanandapur (Sirajganj), Bangabandhu Bridge (west), Joydevpur (Gazipur) and Zia International Airport. In addition, the Rajshahi-bound Dhumketu Express will also stop at Arani station in Rajashi. The operating officer said the Dhumketu would especially serve people of Rajshahi, Natore, Pabna and Sirajganj districts. "Each day, around 2,000 people from Rajshahi alone commute the Dhaka-Rajshahi-Dhaka route. "The new train will serve a lot of passengers," said M A Wahab. He also said the Padma Express will start from Dhaka Cantonment station for Rajshahi from Nov 23 at 10.45 pm instead of the present 11.45 pm.
