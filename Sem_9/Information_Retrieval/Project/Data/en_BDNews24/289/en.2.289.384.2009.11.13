<TITLE> BNP hints at accepting final Bangabandhu trial verdict </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com)--The main opposition BNP, which the ruling Awami League accuses of aiding the assassins of independence hero "Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, has hinted at accepting the Supreme Court's final judgement in the murder trial. "The nation will accept the final verdict the Supreme Court hands down to the real accused," BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said on Friday. The top court set Nov 19 for the final verdict as hearing of appeals by death convicts ended on Thursday. Speaking at a programme of the party's student front, Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, in Ramna in the capital, Delwar, however, was critical of attorney general Mahbubey Alam and prosecution counsels. "It does not appear that justice and rule of law are there." "The way the attorney general and state lawyers are dropping hints about the final verdict before its delivery is inconsistent with the independent judicial system." Military coups and counter-coups after the assassination of president Sheikh Mujib on Aug 15, 1975 saw major general Ziaur Rahman taking state power. Gen Zia later founded BNP to back his political ambitions. Awami League alleges that Zia had aided and abetted the killers of Sheikh Mujib. bdne
