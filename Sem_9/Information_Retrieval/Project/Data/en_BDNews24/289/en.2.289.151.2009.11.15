<TEXT>
 Rajshahi, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission is moving to allow those engaged in the polling process, including election officials and observers, to cast their votes, chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said Sunday. (Corrected) "The electoral law is being revised in a way that one million genuine voters, who were unable to cast their votes before, can exercise the right from the next elections," Huda told a workshop on election management in Rajshahi. Huda said data collection for voter list updates was complete and the election schedules for Dhaka City Corporation and municipality will be declared after finalising the new electoral rolls. The EC is preparing for the DCC elections in May, he said. The commission has begun setting up server stations throughout the country for voter services, providing election information, national identity cards, and dealing with voter queries. Replying to a query from reporters the CEC said those MPs elected while bearing office as mayors of municipalities are now functioning with stay orders from the courts. But their membership would not last, he said. The workshop addresses election conduct, electoral process and the use of transparent ballot boxes. Upazila Nirbahi Officers, police and other officials, representatives of civil society, NGOs and journalists also attended. bdne
