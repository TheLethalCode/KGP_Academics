<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka and New Delhi are set to sign three agreements, including one on prisoner exchange, during prime minister Sheikh Hasina's upcoming visit to India, foreign secretary Md Mijarul Quayes said on Saturday. The other two are for mutual legal assistance on criminal matters and one on combating international terrorism, organised crimes and illegal drug trafficking. Briefing journalists after meeting his Indian counterpart Nirupama Rao on Saturday, Quayes said, "We have received appreciation from the Indian government on security related issues." India has long blamed Bangladesh for harbouring anti-India groups, in particular banned separatist organisations. However, that tone has changed as a string of top Indian militants have been caught by Bangladesh authorities in recent months. The Indian foreign secretary arrived in Dhaka Saturday, on a two-day visit, to prepare the ground for Sheikh Hasina's visit in December. Rao also met prime minister Sheikh Hasina, foreign minister Dipu Moni and leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia. Quayes told reporters after his meeting with Rao that India had "responded positively" to giving Bangladesh railway passage through Indian territory to carry its products to Nepal. He told a briefing at the foreign ministry, "The India side has responded positively to giving us railway transit through three bordering points (Birol-Radhikapur, Rahanpur-Singhabad and Chilahati-Haldibari)." He said they also discussed implementation of the Dhaka-Delhi joint agreements reached during foreign minister Dipu Moni's visit to India in September. Rao told journalists at state guest house Padma after her talks with Quayes, "This is a significant visit. We discussed different issues of the joint agreements." Quayes said, according to a joint statement by the two sides after Dipu Moni's visit, Bangladesh would allow India to carry machinery to its northeastern states to set up a power plant. Replying to a question on whether Bangladesh would give India multi-modal transit facilities via Ashuganj, Quayes said, "There was no mention of declaring Ashuganj as a port of call in the joint statement". He, however, said any development could take place during the highest-leveli.e. upcoming prime minister-levelvisit. The two also resolved to outstanding border problems "as soon as possible". "[Rao] said border killings must stop immediately," said Quayes. Frequent killings of Bangladeshis by the India's Border Security Force is one of the thorny issues between the two countries. There are more than five kilometres of un-demarcated land boundary between Bangladesh and India.
