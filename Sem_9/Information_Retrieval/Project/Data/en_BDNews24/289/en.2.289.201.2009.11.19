 Dhaka, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com)The five appellantsSyed Faruk Rahman, Mohiuddin Ahmed, Bazlul Huda, AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed and Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khancan submit a review petition within 30 days. If they win their appeal, on the other hand, the prosecution may submit the same. A review petition seeks to have the appeals verdict stayed on any "error apparent on the face of the record". The 30 days are counted from the day of receiving the verdict copy in hand. If their review petitions are rejected, the last resort for a condemned man is to seek a presidential clemency. Article 49 of the constitution allows them seven days to do so from the resolution of the review petition. If the clemency is denied, their execution will take place between 21 and 28 days, according to the Criminal Procedure Code. "The convicts will have the scope to file review petitions. The efficacy of the execution will be halted until resolution of the petition," chief prosecution counsel Anisul Haque told bdnews24.com. Article 105 of the constitution gives scope of a petition to the Appellate Division to review the ruling and verdict, additional attorney general A K M Zahirul Haque said. The execution of the death sentence is postponed if the defendant notifies the government and jail authorities of the filing of a review petition. Senior Supreme Court lawyer and former justice Syed Amirul Islam told bdnews24.com: "Any aggrieved person has the right to seek a review petition from the Appellate Division." "The efficacy of execution is halted after the lawyer (of the aggrieved party) notifies the government and jail authorities of the matter." He said: "There is no time frame for resolving the review petition." "A verdict can be stayed on a review petition only if any mistake is found in the records of the case proceedings. But a verdict is seldom stayed in these cases," he said. He said 99% of review petitions were unsuccessful. If the review petition is rejected, the Supreme Court's registrar will immediately notify the home ministry and the jail authorities of the development, he said. "They will set the date for the execution. A letter will be written in red ink for the efficacy of the execution of the convicts." There can be no ruling to halt the verdict on a review petition. The only hope then is clemency, he said. bdnews2
