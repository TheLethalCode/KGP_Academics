 NEW DELHI, Nov 16, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India has put its nuclear power plants on alert and tightened security after intelligence about possible attacks, a report said on Monday. The step comes after a man arrested in the United States on charges of plotting attacks in India was found to have traveled to Indian states that have nuclear installations, the Press Trust of India (PTI), the country's biggest news agency, said.
