<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com)  With less than 48 hours to go before Thursday's final verdict in the Bangabandhu murder case, the five death row convicts in the condemned cells of Dhaka Central Jail are being kept under intense watch. The five, appealing their death sentences in the case, are Syed Faruq Rahman, Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, Bazlul Huda, Mohiuddin Ahmed and AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed. Extra vigil is being kept against suicide, while security has been beefed up at all levels in view of the politically sensitive nature of the long-awaited verdict. Deputy inspector general (prisons) Golam Haider told bdnews24.com, "They are under close watch. All their actions are being closely monitored." He said every jail in the country has been on red alert in the lead-up to the verdict, with deployment of armed police. Haider said extra security arrangements have been made for the Mujib murder convicts at Dhaka Central Jail. An officer of the jail, on condition of anonymity, told bdnews24.com that five close-circuit cameras and mobile phone network jammers were set around the condemned cells accommodating the death row convicts. None of their relatives are being allowed to visit them for the time being, he added. A special team, headed by a deputy jailer, has been formed to ensure security for the convicts. Five guards, one for each convict, have been assigned round-the-clock on three-hour shifts. These guards are thoroughly frisked before they are allowed to be on duty. A special intelligence team has been formed on top of that to secretly monitor all security arrangements. No death convicts, accommodated in the condemned cells, are allowed to move outside their respective confines that have attached bathroom facilities. Condemned cell convicts must also wear special prison uniform at all times in accordance with the jail code. They are allowed to read books. The jail code also permits relatives of death convicts one visit a month. But this provision has been denied to the five Bangabandhu murder convicts since the Oct 21 bomb attack on Awami League MP Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh, a prisons official said. Faruq, Shahriar Rashid and Mohiuddin have been behind bars since 1996, while Huda was jailed in 1998 and AKM Mohiuddin in 2007. A final verdict on Bangabandhu murder trial is set to be delivered on Thursday following the appeals of the convicts to have their death sentences commuted. The nation's founding leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, known as Bangabandhu, and most of his family members were brutally killed in a bloody massacre on Augt 15, 1975. His two daughters, prime minister Sheikh Hasina and sister Sheikh Rehana, were the only survivors of the immediate family. In 1996, 21 years later, a case against 24 persons was filed for the first time in connection with the murders as the Awami League assumed power for the first time after Mujib's death. The trial court gave death sentences to 15 of the convicts. The High Court later upheld the death sentences of 12 on a petition against the trial court verdict. Five of them later appealed against their death sentences in the Supreme Court, but the appeals process was delayed for years on a lack of senior judges. A five-member Appellate Division bench, headed by justice Mohammed Tofazzal Islam, finally started hearing the appeals on Oct 5 this year. The Supreme Court last week set Nov 19 for delivering the judgement after a 26-day hearing on the appeals. Following last month's bomb attack on Taposh, a relative of the prime minister, the government expressed concern about possible acts of sabotage over the judgement of the sensational case that took years of court hearings and delays to reach this final stage. The home ministry and heads of law-enforcing agencies have said all important spots in the capital are being kept under close security surveillance along with other undisclosed special security measures. bdne
