 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)  Income tax returns this year netted Tk 859.93 crore, up 36.28 percent from the previous year, said the National Revenue Board on Sunday. With 758,964 TIN holders submitting returns, the submission rate was 15.51 percent up too, NBR member Aminur Rahman told a press briefing at the revenue board's headquarters on Sunday. But, Rahman said, there are around 2.2 million holders of Tax Identification Numbers throughout the country. "Legal steps will be taken against those who are unable to show valid reasons for failing to submit income tax returns within the extended deadline," he said. The tax return deadline ended Nov 12 after it was twice extended. According to the Income Tax Order, individual tax payers must submit their returns by the end of September. But as in the previous years, the deadline was extended. Acting NBR chairman Jahan Ara Siddiqi and member Syed Aminul Karim were also present at Sunday's press briefing. bdne
