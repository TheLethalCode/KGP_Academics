<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)  The long-overdue council of BNP's Chittagong metropolitan committee will be held on Monday after 20 years, bringing factional infighting of local party leaders to the fore. Vice chairman M Morshed Khan will inaugurate the council at the Institute of Engineers Chittagong Centre to be chaired by convenor of the metropolitan committee Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury. Internal conflicts have been generated ahead of Monday's council, while a faction backed by BNP joint secretary general Abdullah Al Noman declared another council at the nearby Ladies Club as a challenge to the IECC council. MA Sabur, joint convenor of metropolitan BNP and president of the Kotwali committee, round which the rival faction is centred, told bdnews24.com, "We'll march to the Engineers Institute from the central office and if there's any protest, we'll move to the Ladies Club and hold our council there." A rally headed by Chowdhury was brought out in the city Sunday afternoon, where BNP supporters and its associate organisations from 11 thanas and 41 wards participated. He urged all, at a short meeting, to make his council a success. The last council of the Chittagong metropolitan committee was held in 1988, electing Noman president. BNP central leaders reconstituted the metropolitan committee in 1997, selecting Mir Mohammad Nasir Uddin and Dastagir Chowdhury as its president and general secretary. The committee was dissolved in May 2005 after Nasir lost the mayoral elections and a convening committee was later announced headed by former whip Syed Wahidul Alam which was also reconstituted in line with the other BNP committees in June last year. bdnews24
