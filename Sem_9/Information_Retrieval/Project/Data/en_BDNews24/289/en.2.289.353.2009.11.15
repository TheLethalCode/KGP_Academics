 Dhaka, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner AKM Shahidul Haque on Saturday instructed his 25,000 force to be extra watchful ahead of the upcoming verdict in the Bangabandhu assassination case. He said, "The verdict will be declared on Nov 19. Everyone, including the traffic police, is instructed to keep eyes and ears wide open." "We are not really expecting any major trouble. However, we have to be careful." RAB and intelligence agencies are already working closely to ensure tight security, said the commissioner. The Supreme Court last week set the final verdict date in the Bangabandhu murder trial as hearing of appeals by death convicts came to a close, more than three decades after the Aug 15 1975 killings.
