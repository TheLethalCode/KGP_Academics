<TEXT>
 YANGON, Nov 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Detained Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi has requested a meeting with the military regime's top leader, adding to signs that lines of communication are opening up between her and the junta. In a letter dated Nov. 11, obtained by Reuters on Monday, the 64-year-old Nobel peace laureate said she wanted to work with General Than Shwe's government, which calls itself the State Peace and Development Council, in the interests of the country.

In the letter, Suu Kyi also expressed thanks to the regime for allowing her to meet on Nov. 4 with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell, the highest-ranking U.S. diplomat to visit Myanmar in 14 years. She asked for permission to visit three senior leaders of her National League for Democracy Party who are also under house arrest and approval to hold a plenary meeting with leaders of her party in her home before meeting with Than Shwe. Nyan Win, spokesman of the NLD party and a member of Suu Kyi's legal defence team, said the government had yet to reply to her letter. Lawyers for Suu Kyi said on Friday they had lodged an appeal against her house arrest with the Supreme Court but expected no rapid decisi
