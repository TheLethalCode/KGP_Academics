 Dhaka, Nov 11 (bdnews24.com)  Two new teams, four fielding substitutes instead of the lone 12th man, pink balls in practice matches and abolishing the Icon player status are some of the innovations which the Indian Premier League would embrace from its 2011 edition, reports PTI. From next year onwards, IPL would also be played under the supervision of the ICC anti-corruption and security unit (ACSU), while players who skip the tournament despite not having any national assignment might have their contracts terminated, organisers of the event said in a statement.

On the decision to expand the league, they said, "A discussion for the addition of two new franchises in season 4 was held with the same being adopted with 7 of the 8 franchises being in favour of increasing the number of teams to 10." Among other things, it was finalised that trading of players will be permitted between franchisees for the season 2010 onwards. Meanwhile, Pakistani players' participation will have to be confirmed by their board and clearance from their government. On January 19 next year, IPL would conduct an auction, adding new players into the league and a fresh purse of $750,000 will available to each franchisee.
