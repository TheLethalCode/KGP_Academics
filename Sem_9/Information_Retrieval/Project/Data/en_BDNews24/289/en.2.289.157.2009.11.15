 Dhaka, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com)  As the greater neighbouring country, India should take the initiative in strengthening bilateral ties with Bangladesh, the opposition leader Khaleda Zia said on Saturday. BNP chairperson Khaleda also said her party wanted to maintain friendly ties with the neighboring country, during a meeting with Indian foreign secretary Nirupama Rao at the former's political office in Gulshan. Rao lauded Khaleda's contribution in the progress of women's education in Bangladesh. The meeting touched on diverse bilateral issues, the border situation, India's Tipaimukh dam project and the high trade deficit. Shamsher Mobin Chowdhury, Khaleda's foreign affairs adviser, briefed reporters on the meeting. He said the two-time former prime minister called on India to take initiatives on unresolved issues through talks with Bangladesh. He said the BNP chairperson imparted to Rao the feared impact of India's proposed Tipaimukh dam project upon Bangladesh. She was also reminded of prime minister Manmohan Singh's meeting with then prime minister Khaleda in 2006 on the issue. Rao said Singh would not do anything that would be harmful for Bangladesh. On border killings by BSF, Khaleda requested Rao to take effective steps to avoid such incidents. Khaleda also called on India to open up opportunities for more Bangladesh exports to India to bring down the high trade deficit. b
