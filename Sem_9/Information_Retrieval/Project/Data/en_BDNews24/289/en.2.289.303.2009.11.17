<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com) The central bank chief has asked the banks to assist the small and medium enterprises with more loans. "We would like to see you extending your cooperation to the SME sector. Let's all lend a hand specially to the development of this sector," Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman said at the seminar. The seminar on 'Global financial meltdown and international trade finance' was held at Bangladesh Institute of Bank Management auditorium on Tuesday. "You can invest in agriculture tools being manufactured at Ghatail, Tangail as well as light industries and engineering works of Bogra." "Banks should invest in agro-based enterprises across the country. For example, Pirojpur guava growers should be able to attract bankers who should enable them to start making guava conserves, jam, jelly etc. utilising the bumper production of the fruit in the area." Rahman called on bankers to switch from the consumers to the productive sectors and aid the growers and manufacturers more. "We have to expand our domestic market by creating and increasing demands within the country." On the global economic crunch, he said, "The recession has caused both problems and opportunities. We have achieved growth in exports despite the crunch, holding the first place in the US and second in the European market." The foreign exchange reserve has been augmented to a new high of 10 billion dollars and the banks enjoy a liquidity influx of over Tk 35,000 crore, he added. "Some newspapers have published stories analysing what should be done with the forex influx." "We might employ the reserve, for example, in bailing out the exporters," the top banker said. The rate of opening letters of credit in Nov 2009 has increased 57 percent compared to last year. The governor said traveller's foreign currency carrying limits are being stretched. BIBM professor Toufiq Ahmed Chowdhury in his keynote paper said trade financing has increased compared with what it has been during the last couple of years. Readymade garment export, however, may face a crunch in the coming months, he said. b
