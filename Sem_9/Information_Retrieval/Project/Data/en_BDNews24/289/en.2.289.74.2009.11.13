 MANILA, Fri Nov 13, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged the Philippines and the country's largest Muslim rebel group on Friday to strike a peace deal before President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo steps down next June. Clinton said she believed Arroyo, whom she met over dinner on Thursday, was committed to ending the decades-old Muslim conflict in the southern region of Mindanao and was prepared to make tough and unpopular decisions. "I think that the president is committed, she wants to see this done," Clinton said during a televised question-and-answer session with students in Manila, referring to reaching a peace deal with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).

Since 2002, about 300 US troops have been deployed to help train, assist and advise the Philippines on how to counter the Abu Sayyaf, which has ties to al Qaeda and regional network Jemaah Islamiah. They are forbidden from actual combat. Clinton said the expiration of Arroyo's term could be an impetus in pushing a government-MILF peace deal. But, the former US first lady and senator cautioned against reaching an agreement outside the constitution and laws of the country because "that will be creating more problems". Clinton said Washington wants to help facilitate peace talks by talking to both sides and providing social and economic aid to improve lives of people in Mindanao and "isolate those who are not interested in peace at all and are only interested in conflict and terrori
