 Dhaka, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com)  Inhabitants of Bangladesh's chars or river islands, some of the most climate vulnerable communities in the world, urged the government Saturday to push hard, as a key player in Copenhagen, for binding emission pledges by developed nations. Others, addressing a poverty and climate hearing staged on floating boats, called on the government to secure at least $200 billion per year for poor countries in mitigation and adaptation funds. "The frequency and duration of floods and river erosion have increased drastically in the last few years causing severe harm to our lives and livelihoods," char dweller Hamida Begum told a panel of judges in the hearing. More than 6,000 men and women from chars across the country, mostly comprising small farming and fishing communities, urged the government to place their testimony at the 15th UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen (COP15) next month. The climate poverty hearing in Gaibandha, a northern district of Bangladesh, meanwhile, was staged on fifteen floating boats in the Ghaghot river on Saturday. The hearing was organised by Campaign for Sustainable Rural Livelihoods (CSRL), a group of 150 international, national and grassroots organisations, with support from Oxfam International. From Kurigram, Abu Sayeed, 35, gave testimony of his loss of farmland due to river erosion. He said he was forced to become a day labourer, where once he had a small but secure livelihood. Abul Hossain told a similar tale, as he and others suffered failure of jute crops because of erratic rainfall during the most recent monsoon. Representatives of academia, media and social groups, supporting these personal testimonies, demanded justice for those in Bangladesh already facing the adverse impacts of climate change. They called on the government to secure at least $200 billion per year for poor countries in mitigation and adaptation funds. The judges also concluded by supporting the call for government pressure on developed countries to ratify the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for an effective outcome with binding commitments at COP15. Mahbub Ara Gini, MP from Gaibandha-2, assured them that the government would play an active role in safeguarding people's interest in Copenhagen in December. COP15 aims to reach agreement among developed and developing nations on binding commitments to cut emissions, to replace the previous Kyoto Protocol that expires in 2012. Bangladesh, as a vocal leader of the most vulnerable countries, is seen as one the key players among developing nations.
