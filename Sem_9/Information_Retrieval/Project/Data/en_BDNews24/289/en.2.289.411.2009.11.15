 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)  Two years on, the aftermath of the devastating Cyclone Sidr still haunts Bangladesh's coastal districts, yet to recover from the losses to life, land and property. The government, donors, local and international NGOs have undertaken short and long-term rehabilitation programmes, many of which are still underway. The cyclone that raged across the low-lying coast of southern Bangladesh, with winds of over 230 km/h, was the deadliest storm to hit the country in more than a decade. It ravaged large swathes of the country, ended thousands of lives and wrecked millions more. It swept away countless mud and thatch homes, downed trees, devastating the Sundarbans, sent mobile telephone towers crashing, and knocked out power lines. Government estimates put the death toll at 3,032. Of them, 1070 died in Barguna, 762 in Bagerhat, 466 in Patuakhali, 380 in Pirojpur, 88 in Barisal and the rest in the surrounding areas. However, unofficial figures counted deaths, including those in the aftermath, at up to 15,000. About 55,282 people suffered injuries. Although, in terms of loss of human lives, Sidr may not be considered as deadly as the cyclones of 1970, when an estimated 500,000 were killed, or of 1991, with a toll of 138,000, in terms of loss to the national economy, it might have been the worst. According to official estimates a total of 1.6 million households and 6.7 million people were affected by the disaster. Crops stretching across half a million acres of land, including 600,000 MT of the staple rice, were completely destroyed. Another 1.25 million acres were partially destroyed. Over 4 million trees were blown down. The economic losses were estimated at Tk 115.6 billion. Of the affected areas Barguna, Bagerhat and Patuakhali received the full brunt of the carnage and incurred maximum losses. How are the cyclone victims and rehabilitation projects in these districts faring two years on? Barguna According to the government, over 1,000 people died in Barguna, the highest toll among the districts ravaged by Cyclone Sidr. Around 77,754 households were blown or washed away, while another 112,031 homes were partially damaged. Of these, just 34,871 homes have been totally rebuilt, while 59,883 households were given Tk 5000 each for repairs to damaged homes. But few of the latter could carry out the necessary repairs as the money had to be spent on buying food and clothing in the aftermath of Sidr. Two years after the carnage more than 20,000 families are still living in makeshift structures. Abdur Razzak Zihadi, a resident of Kakchira village in the Sadar Upazila, complains of irregularities in rebuilding projects. He said cyclone victims would have had a better chance of getting rehabilitated if their houses were rebuilt after analysis by donors and NGOs rather than Upazila Parishad (local council) chairman and members. But Abul Kalam Mridha, of Boro Lobongola village, claimed that officials of an NGO demanded payment of Tk 6,000 in return for building his home, which he could not afford to pay. Barguna district commissioner, Swapan Kumar Sarkar, said, "Around Tk 95 lakh and 250 bundles of tin have been collected for those who could not rebuild their homes." "They have been allocated to Upazila Nirbahi Officers." Two years after the cyclone, he says, "Construction work will start very soon." Bagerhat Nearly 1.4 million residents of Bagerhat district are at serious risk from a recurring cyclone. Local government engineers said there are still hundreds of shelters needed to protect to the population. An official estimate was not available from any government office of the percentage at risk across the whole district. But the Local Government Engineering Department estimates that as many as 40 percent of the residents would be at risk again if another major cyclone struck. LGED assistant engineer Mohammed Abdur Rahim said, "Nearly 40 percent of the district is at high or mid level risk." "At least 490 more shelters are needed for their protection." Currently there are just 113 shelters in the district. "Work is going on to build another 81 shelters using funds from the government, Asian Development Bank and other donor organisations." "The new shelters would protect only 142,000 people." This is just a tenth of those still at risk, he said.. Bagerhat district commissioner, Mohammed Muajjem Hossain, admitted, "The number of cyclone shelters are not sufficient. A lot more shelters have to be built here." Patuakhali Thousands are still mourning their families two years after the havoc wreaked by Cyclone Sidr. It doesn't help that many continue to subsist under the open sky unable to remake their homes. Minara Begum, of Charkhali village in the Sadar Upazila, was lucky enough to get various help from donors, including a new home. But her days are spent shedding tears over her husband and two children lost in the carnage. Her neighbour Jamal Hossain tells of the death of his father and mother after they ensured the survival of their children. The couple managed floats for all six children before being swept away in the waves themselves. Jamal, the eldest of the six, now looks after the family. His younger brother Sakib, aged just 8, is no longer haunted by the memories of that night. But he knows, finally, that his parents are never returning. UP chairman Mobarak Ali Munshi said, "A lot of affected families have yet to receive proper aid." He still hopes for productive support from the government and donor organisations for the cyclone victims in his area. Burden of worsening climate Areas affected by the cyclone are still struggling to recover from the devastation that struck on the night of Nov 15 2007. Many of the survivors who watched waves wash away their villages, spending hours clinging to trees to survive, remain deeply traumatised. The cyclone also brought an extra burden to the economy that had already faced successive floods while natural and manmade disasters across the world caused food and oil price to rocket on the international market that year. The cyclone in November hit just at the time when the country was yet to recover from twin floods during July-August causing damage of about Tk 2.7 billion. The Aman rice crop, the predominant source of staple food in the area, was also about to be harvested. The agricultural ministry had estimated that Sidr caused immediate losses of at least 600,000 metric tonnes of Aman rice in the coastal areas. The world's largest mangrove forest, the Sundarbans, also took the full brunt of Sidr, with a quarter of the flora of the world heritage site totally destroyed and animals in their thousands perishing, according to the primary assessment of the forest department. Bangladesh  trapped between the Bay of Bengal and the Himalayas  and with 17 million people along the coast living less than one metre above sea level  has always suffered more than its share of natural disasters. But Sidr is only part of worsening climatic instability that is threatening ordinary people's ability to survive.
