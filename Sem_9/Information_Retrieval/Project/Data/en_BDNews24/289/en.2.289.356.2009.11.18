 bdnews24.com New Delhi correspondent New Delhi, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com)  When a new batch of civil service officers go to the Bangladesh Public Administration Training Centre in Savar next year, they may well be joined by a number of young would-be-bureaucrats from India, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Nepal Bhutan and Maldives. Bangladesh Civil Service rookies may in turn rub their shoulders with the fresh entrants to Indian bureaucracy at the elite Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration in the picturesque hill-station Mussoorie, some 300 kilometres from New Delhi. This may all be possible if a proposal by cabinet secretaries of the eight member countries of the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation, in a recent meeting in the Indian capital, is accepted by the bloc's leaders in next year's summit in Bhutan. The SAARC secretary general Sheel Kant Sharma said that the cabinet secretaries had proposed to institutionalise regional collaboration among the SAARC institutions and officials "by creating a network of institutions, reserving training slots in prestigious institutions in the member-countries" for officials from other countries in the bloc and through "exchange of visits." The cabinet secretaries of all the eight SAARC countries attended the two-day meet that deliberated on issues of common concern, such as administrative reforms, rural development, performance management and e-governance. As the SAARC is transforming from "a declaratory body" to "implementation body", the meet emphasized on the need to strengthen administrative and delivery mechanism. The cabinet secretaries shared their experiences and exchanged notes on significant innovations tried in various Member States for the benefit of the citizens. They also discussed rural development programmes in their own countries and the impact made by them. "Various institutions in the SAARC member countries have developed rural development models. These models will be made available to the SAARC Secretariat, which will then put together an Index of Rural Development Models," said Sharma. The index will help member-countries exchange information and knowledge on rural development, he added. The meet decided that the member states in collaboration with the grouping's secretariat in Kathmandu would identify one or more regional rural development projects for implementation with monetary support from the SAARC Development Fund. The cabinet secretaries proposed collaboration in the area of performance management and evaluation through sharing of expertise and experience. They also decided that the member states would identify the projects, where e-governance could be used for improving public service delivery and share knowledge and expertise. The SAARC secretary general said that the meet was the first of its kind by the cabinet secretaries of the eight members of the regional bloc. "It revealed how common the member-states' concerns in governance are and how they can benefit by enhancing collaboration in this field," said Sharma.
