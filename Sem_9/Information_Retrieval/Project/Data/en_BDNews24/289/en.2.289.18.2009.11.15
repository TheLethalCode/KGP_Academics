<TEXT>
 PARIS, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serbia's Novak Djokovic praised his "perfect" performance after outclassing world number two Rafael Nadal 6-2, 6-3 to set up a Paris Masters final against local hope Gael Monfils on Saturday. World number three Djokovic, who beat world number one Roger Federer in the Basel final last week, extended a brilliant run of form and will start favourite against Monfils, having won their three previous encounters. Monfils, seeded 15th, thrilled the 14,000 fans packing the Bercy hall when he knocked out 13th Radek Stepanek of the Czech Republic 6-4, 5-7, 6-4 in the other semi-final, which was a lot tighter and could have gone either way. "There's not much to say about today's performance except it was perfect, you know, exactly the way I wanted it," said Djokovic. "I was hitting winners from all over the court and really trying to keep that momentum going during the whole match," he added, summing up a spectacular performance. Djokovic will play his fifth final and chase a first title this year in a Masters 1000 event while Monfils will feature in a final in the showcase series for the first time. Spaniard Nadal, who has not won a title since beating Djokovic in the Rome Masters final last May, looked helpless at times and will now prepare for the Nov. 22-29 World Tour Finals in London featuring the world's top eight players. "PLAYED UNBELIEVABLE" "I didn't play badly but he played unbelievable," said Nadal, who leads 14-6 against Djokovic but has now lost their last two meetings.

The 22-year-old Serb was on top throughout the match, displaying his confidence in the second set when he won the first two games to love and broke Nadal in the second with a forehand winner. Nadal, who won the French Open four times on the other side but never this indoor event, could not recover and Djokovic remained in charge until sealing victory with a another superb forehand on the first match point after just 76 minutes. Showman Monfils then alternated amazing winners and clumsy errors before taming Stepanek in a close contest that lasted over two and a half hours. The acrobatic Frenchman had the crowd on his side but showed signs of nerves, notably when he served for the match, leading 5-4 in the second set, only to be broken. A third set was needed, in which the pair traded breaks before Monfils managed the telling one in the ninth game to serve for the match. The fans went wild when Stepanek hit a return long on the first match point. "I was maybe thinking too much about the final and I lost my concentration at times but I never really doubted," said Monfils. "Playing a final in France is a special occasion.
