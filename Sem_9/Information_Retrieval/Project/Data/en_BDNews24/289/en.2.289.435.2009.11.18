 Abdur Rahim Harmachi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com)The Public-Private Partnership (PPP) initiative, launched this fiscal year to boost investments in crumbling infrastructure, may finally be taking off with a mega transport project in the capital. The communications ministry is set to float an international pre-qualification tender for Bangladesh's first elevated expressway on Thursday, the first under the PPP plan. Officials of the communications ministry said on Wednesday the Tk 17,000 crore ($2.5 billion) project, will also see the first online tender in the country. Good news. But the much-vaunted PPP concept, seen as critical to economic growth, has been slow off the ground. The incumbent government announced the new economic venture five months ago under the current budget, to bring together public and private sector investments, especially foreign funds, for building large-scale infrastructure for industry and national development. Finance minister AMA Muhith expressed the hope that long pending giant projects will be taken up through the initiative. In the past, there have been public-private initiatives in certain sectors such as telecommunications and development of land ports. But no government had previously earmarked a sizeable allocation in the national budget before, specifically for mega PPP projects. Muhith made a provision of Tk 25 billion for PPP projects in this year's budget to promote investment in major infrastructure such as mass transit and large-scale power production. The government has so far published a situation paper on the PPP concept, on June 11, the budget presentation day, which was distributed along with other budget documents among members of parliament and the media. But the government has taken time to finalise guidelines on the initiative, while confusion reigns as to whether the Ministry of Finance or Board of Investment has the authority to administer PPP-related projects in certain sectors. A tender had still not been floated five months into the financial year. The cabinet on Oct 21 finally gave the communication ministry the go-ahead to invite bids from experienced firms for construction of a metro rail and elevated expressway in capital Dhaka at an estimated Tk 15,000 crore ($2.2 billion). A tender is finally set to be floated under the public-private initiative, the communications ministry has said. International pre-qualification tenders will be invited for the Dhaka elevated expressway project up to Jan 20, 2010. This may come as good news to the business community, who have been gloomy about the slow start of the critical PPP venture. But analysts are pointing out that time is running out to take up major public-private projects under the budget of the current fiscal year. The finance minister himself expressed dismay by the slow take-off. At a discussion on Nov 14, Muhith said, "Due to unavoidable complications, tenders for a number of PPP projects of public importance could not be floated." FBCCI president Annisul Huq told bdnews24.com, "We have been quite optimistic about the prospects of the proposed PPP enterprises. Businessmen are ready to work with the government in nation building." "But it is not materialising due to delays and glitches made and faced by the government." He was disappointed that no tender for the envisaged PPP ventures had been announced before now. Former caretaker government finance adviser Mirza AB Azizul Islam was cautious about the future. "I had welcomed the PPP in the budget as a great initiative, though its implementation may be quite difficult." He suggested that to accelerate the pace of national development through the PPP, the government should immediately form a special committee with appropriate public-private membership, seek their recommendations on implementing the PPP and develop a guideline to be followed by all concerned. The government's situation paper in June sees a number of mammoth development projects involving the private sector as a partner. Some would take as long as five to seven years to implement. The paper contained a list of seven mega projects envisaged under the PPP along with their estimated costs. Six of them would cost a total of Tk 95, 565 crore (Tk 955.65 billion or $13.85 billion). Estimate for the seventh project was not included. Five are projected for Dhaka, one for Chittagong and one unspecified for another area of the country. They include: Dhaka-Chittagong Express Highway, Dhaka Metropolitan Skyrail, Dhaka Metropolitan Elevated Expressway, Dhaka Metropolitan Underground Railway and Dhaka-Narayanganj-Gazipur-Dhaka Elevated Expressway to be implemented under the communications ministry. They also include construction of four coal-fired or diesel and gas operated 450 megawatt capacity power plants in different areas under the energy and power ministry and construction of a deep sea-port in the Chittagong area under the shipping ministry. Such mega projects apart, smaller ones like bridges, flyovers, underpasses, tunnels, university dormitories and hospitals are also envisaged to eventually be constructed through PPP ventures. bdnews24.com
