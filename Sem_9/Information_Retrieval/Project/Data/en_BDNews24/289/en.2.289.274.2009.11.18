<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Tuesday ordered the government to suspend all payment to Canadian oil firm Niko Resources Ltd until resolution fo a compensation case in connection with the 2005 fires at Tengratila gas field in Sunamganj. The government filed the case against Niko in 2008, seeking over Tk 7.5 billion in damages. The court on Tuesday also ordered the government to submit an overdue investigation report within 15 days on the gas field fires in January and June 2005. It also issued a rule nisi asking the government to explain why an agreement between Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration & Production Company Limited (BAPEX) and Niko should not be declared illegal. The bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Qamrul Islam Siddique gave the orders on a public interest petition filed by the Bangladesh Environment Lawyers Association, Ain O Salish Kendra and Odhikar in 2005. The petition challenged the legality of the deal between BAPEX and Niko, signed in 2003. It also said negligence by the Canadian company caused the Tengratila blow-outs and subsequent fires on Jan 7 and June 24 of 2005. BELA lawyer Iqbal Kabir told bdnews24.com Tuesday, "BELA fielded the petition to annul the deal between BAPEX and Niko." The High Court had once before ordered the government to stop paying Niko, in September 2005 when the petition was first filed. The court at the time had also ordered the government to freeze all the company's bank accounts in Bangladesh until the petition was resolved. The Appellate Division later amended the High Court order allowing Niko to draw the minimum amount of funds needed to meet necessary internal expenses, but barred the company from sending money abroad. Petrobangla recently moved to release more funds to Niko for greater production from Feni field this year, following severe gas crisis in industry-dependent Chittagong. Niko had suspended further field development works in Feni when Petrobangla stopped payment following the 2005 High Court order. The Canadian company is now supplying just 3.4 mmcfd of gas from the Feni field. The recoverable gas reserve at the field is about 69 billion cubic feet, according to Petrobangla. Bangladesh faces over 200 mmcfd of gas shortage a year, severely curbing power production and industry. About 1760 mmcfd of gas is produced a year against the demand for about 2000 mmcfd. Barrister Rokonuddin Mahmud represented Niko in Tuesday's hearing, while Mahmudul Islam stood for BELA. Additional attorney general MK Rahman participated for the prosecution and barrister Abdullah Al Mamun for Petrobangla. bd
