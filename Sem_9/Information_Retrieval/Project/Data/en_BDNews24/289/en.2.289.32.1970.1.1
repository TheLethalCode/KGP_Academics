 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court on Sunday granted CID police four more days to grill BNP leader Ariful Islam, also a Dhaka City Corporation councillor, in connection with the Aug 21, 2004 grenade attack case. CID produced Arif to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court after the first five-day remand and asked for remanding him into custody for another 10 days. Prosecution counsels Mokhlesur Rahman Badal and Abdur Rahman Hawladar argued for the remand petition. Defence counsels Mohsin Mia and Sanaullah Mia opposed the remand plea and appealed for his bail. Metropolitan Magistrate Mohammed Moazzem Hussain finally gave CID four more days. The Aug 21 grenade attack at Bangabandhu Avenue killed at least 23 people and left scores injured, including prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who was then opposition leader. Some 22 people stand charged in the cases, including former BNP state minister Abdus Salam Pintu, his brother Maolana Tajuddin, also the alleged grenade supplier, and Mufti Hannan, leader of banned Islamist outfit Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami. bdnews
