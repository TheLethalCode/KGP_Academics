 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com)  The government will stockpile 3,00,000 metric tonnes of rice from the upcoming Aman harvest, a portion to be procured straight from farmers, food minister Abdur Razzak said Thursday. The target comprises or 200,000 MT rice and 150,000 MT paddy, in a procurement drive running from Dec 7 through to Feb 28 next year. "In a new initiative, half the paddy will be procured straight from the farmers so they receive a fair price," Razzak told reporters after a meeting of the ministry's food planning and monitoring committee. The price has been fixed at Tk 14 and Tk 22 per kg for paddy and rice respectively, where the paddy production cost for farmers was estimated at Tk 13 per kg. This 'direct from growers' quota is being introduced for the first time on an experimental basis, said the minister. "The government is keen to introduce direct purchase from farmers in other procurements," he said. "The government cannot always afford to buy 300,000 MT rice, although the target is almost the same each year," he said. "Around 150,000 MT has been purchased annually on average in past years, but the government sticks to a higher estimate to try and raise the stock for the benefit of farmers, and for unforeseen disasters," he added. Aman cultivation is relatively low-cost, said the minister, as it needs little irrigation and fertiliser. "Moreover, the government has cut the fertiliser cost this year," he said. "But, as many farmers had bought in fertiliser before the cost cuts, the government is compensating with its procurement from farmers," said the minister. According to the decision, rice millers must buy certain quota of paddy direct from the farmers, he said. The meetingattended by finance minister AMA Muhith, agriculture minister Matia Chowdhury and director general of the food directorate Pius Costa among othersalso decided in principle to charge a nominal price for rice distributed under the Vulnerable Group Feeding programme. The minister said around 30 per cent of the VGF rice will be distributed free of cost among the hardcore poor, physically challenged, elderly people and widows. "A minimum price will be charged for the rest." He said the decision was made to discourage "dependency on the government". The charge would be nominal, he said. "Around Tk 4 to 5 per kg, not more than Tk 5." bdnews24.
