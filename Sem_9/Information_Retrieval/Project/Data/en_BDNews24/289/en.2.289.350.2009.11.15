<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)--A Dhaka court on Sunday ordered Arafat Rahman Coco, younger son of opposition chief Khaleda Zia, to appear before it on Nov 23 on money laundering charges. Judge A N M Bashirullah of the Senior Special Judge's Court gave the order in the afternoon. Coco is in Bangkok for treatment on parole. The judge also issued warrant of arrest against another accused of the case, Ismail Hossain Simon, the son of former shipping minister Akbar Hossain. The investigation officer had appealed to the court last Thursday to order the warrant of Simon. The Anticorruption Commission pressed charges against the duo at the Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court on that day. The ACC filed the case on Mar 17 with the Kafrul Police Station, accusing Coco of laundering 28, 84, 000 Singapore dollars and 9, 32, 000 US dollars. The case details say the amount was deposited to a Singapore bank account of Coco by foreign companies that were to be awarded construction work in Bangladesh during the rule of Khaleda's 2001-2006 administration. In the event of a guilty finding, Coco will face a maximum seven years in jail. Some 23 persons have been made prosecution witnesses. The government on Thursday extended by another month the parole of Coco. Coco, also an accused in the GATCO corruption case alongside his mother, and facing other graft cases, fell ill during detention in prison during the past caretaker government's tenure. He was paroled on July 17 last year for eight weeks for medical treatment abroad and flew to Bangkok two days later. The government has since successively extended Coco's parole by a month each time. b
