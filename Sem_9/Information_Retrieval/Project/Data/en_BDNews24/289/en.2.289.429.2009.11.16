 Kishoreganj, Nov 16 (bdnews24.com)  A non-stop siege of Kishoreganj, enforced by the Bhairab District Implementation Committee, was "temporarily" lifted on Monday morning after three days of road, rail and river blockades. The siege began on Friday to press for a separate Bhairab district and for arresting agitators opposing the new district who had torched an effigy of president Zillur Rahman in Kishoreganj during a hartal on Nov 2. The government had earlier proposed Bhairab, the home place of Zillur Rahman, could become the country's 65th district. The committee's three-day siege of Kishoreganj had seriously disrupted road, rail and river traffic through the district. At 10 pm on Sunday, the committee leaders told reporters of their decision to lift the siege "temporarily". The council member-secretary Al-Hajj Md Sirajuddin, Upazila chairman Mostak Ahmed Bulbul, municipal mayor Fakhrul Alam Akkas, Upazila Awami League general secretary Abul Mansur and others were present at the press briefing. Al-Hajj Sirajuddin told bdnews24.com that the government has taken utmost caution to maintain law and order ahead of the delivery of judgement on Bangabandhu murder case on Nov 19. Responding to the government's call, the council decided to lift the siege for the time being in the greater interest of national security and solidarity, he said. But a fresh programme in this regard would be announced soon, he added. bdn
