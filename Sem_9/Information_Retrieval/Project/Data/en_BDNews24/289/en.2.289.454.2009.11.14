<TITLE> Retirement crosses exhausted Tevez's mind </TITLE>

 BUENOS AIRES, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Disappointment at losing his first choice place for Argentina and exhaustion have led Carlos Tevez to consider retirement after the World Cup, despite being only 25, usually a peak age in a footballer's career. "My chance passed. I had my possibility and I couldn't take advantage of it. When the team needed goals I couldn't provide them," Tevez said.

I want to enjoy my family a bit. I'm very keen to stop and get a bit of calm. I've already won a lot. Living for football has saturated me." Tevez has been very successful already, being voted South American footballer of the year three times in a row, winning the Libertadores Cup and the world club title with Boca in 2003, the Brazilian league title with Corinthians in 2005 and an Olympic gold medal with Argentina in 2004. In England, he helped West Ham avoid relegation in 2007 and Manchester United lift two Premier League titles and be crowned European and world club champions last year. Tevez, who last month said he sometimes wanted to quit the national team, added that he got fed up with criticism of Maradona's side as they struggled in the World Cup qualifiers. "We were criticised a lot, sometimes rightly so, but to have people say we didn't play well because of the money or we don't love the (Argentina) shirt, don't sing the national anthem, there's a lot of ill will," Tevez sa
