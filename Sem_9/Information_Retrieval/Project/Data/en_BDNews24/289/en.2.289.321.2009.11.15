<TEXT>
 Kishoreganj, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)Bhairab activists continued their blockade of Kishoreganj for the third day Sunday to press their demand for a separate district. The Bhairab District Implementation Committee lay seige to the Durjoy Bhairab Chattar, railway station and river-port terminal. The non-stop siege programme began Friday to create pressure on the government to declare Bhairab, the home place of President Zillur Rahman, as the country's 65th district. Traffic on the Kishoreganj-Bhairab highway has remained suspended. Vehicles leaving Kishoreganj for Dhaka are moving via Monohordi and Kapashia. River and rail communication between Kishoreganj and Bhairab has also remained cut. The non-stop siege has seriously disrupted daily life, say local residents, affecting business, study and the law courts. However, no violence has so far been reported, say police.
