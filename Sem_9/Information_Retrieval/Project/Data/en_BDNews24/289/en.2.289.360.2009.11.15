 Rajshahi, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com)  Police raided Rajshahi University halls in the early hours of Sunday, for a second night in succession and the third in under a week, on allegations that "large caches of arms" were being amassed on campus by Shibir activists. Authorities said a Shibir leader, Hasnat Ali Liton, was arrested at around 1.30am with a "cocktail bomb", and another 30 were picked up for questioning as "powder and chemicals" were found in a room. Rajshahi Metropolitan Police sub inspector Alamgir Hossain told bdnews24.com the arrestee was Nawab Abdul Latif Hall's Shibir president. University proctor Chowdhury Mohammad Zakir said the others held for questioning were later released. He said a suspicious substance, "looking like gunpowder", and "other chemicals" were found in Room 329 of Latif Hall. Nawab Abdul Latif, Shah Makhdum and Amer Ali halls were being raided from midnight, the university's assistant proctor Mushtak Ahmed had earlier told bdnews24.com. The raid ended about 2am. Witnesses said police had also raided a number of Shibir messes, including the five-storey Welfare Mess, at Binotpur adjacent to the campus. The area is known locally as a 'Shibir stronghold'. Earlier in the day, Islami Chhatra Shibir and Bangladesh Chhatra League, who made the arms allegations against their rivals, faced off at Nawab Abdul Latif Hall raising tensions on campus. Less than 24 hours before, Madar Baksh Hall was raided on the same suspicion of 'Shibir arms'. The two-hour raid also ran from midnight up to 2am on Saturday, said police. But no arms were found and no arrests made on the night, Motihar police chief Tofazzal Hossain had told bdnews24.com. In yet an earlier raid, on Madar Baksh Hall and Suhrawardy Hall, last Wednesday night, police had recovered two cocktails and held two Shibir activists. Ibrahim Hossain Moon, president of the pro-ruling party Bangladesh Chhatra League, has claimed Shibir activists were "storing up arms in all the halls on campus". Mushtak Ahmed said university authorities would ask police to raid every hall if necessary. Pro-Jamaat Chhatra Shibir has been claiming the administration is harassing them in the name of "arms raids". bdnews
