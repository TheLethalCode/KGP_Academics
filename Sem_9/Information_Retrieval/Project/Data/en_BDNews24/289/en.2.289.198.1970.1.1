<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh has supported Saudi Arabia's military action against Houthi fighters who have allegedly entered the kingdom's territory illegally from Yemen. Dhaka expressed concern at the "incidents" along the Saudi-Yemeni border and condemned the "incursion by the infiltrators". Bangladesh also expressed solidarity with the Saudi government for military operations against the Houthi who claim they are fleeing oppression by the Yemeni army. "Considering its close brotherly relations with Saudi Arabia, the government of Bangladesh condemns the incursion by the infiltrators inside the Saudi territory," said a foreign ministry press statement Wednesday. "Bangladesh believes that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has rightly taken some actions as deemed appropriate to protect Saudi territorial integrity and expresses its solidarity with the government and people of Saudi Arabia in this regard," it said. "The government of Bangladesh has noted with concern the recent incident along the Saudi-Yemeni border." Foreign ministry officials say Dhaka supports Riyadh in line with Bangladesh's foreign policy which is against all forms of violence and infiltration. Besides, Saudi Arabia is Bangladesh's largest manpower market. About 2 million Bangladeshis either live or work in the Sheikhdom. The Saudi armed forces on Aug 11 this year carried out a full-scale offensive against the Houthi, a small Shia armed group fighting against the Sunni majority government in Sanaa, in its territory along the Yemeni border. Sunni majority Saudi Arabia and Yemen cooperate closely on fighting the Houthi fighters. Both the countries allege that regional power Iran is the backer of the Houthipart of the Shiah majority in Northern Yemen. Tehran denies the allegations. The group is concentrated mainly in Yemen's Saada and Amran provinces. They are known as Houthis after their late leader, Hussein Badr Eddin al-Houthi, a Zaidi leader who was killed by the Yemeni army in September 2004. The Yemeni government alleges that Houthis are out to restore an imamate overthrown in a 1962 coup causing eight years of civil war in Yemen. The Houthis say they are fighting to defend their community against government aggression and marginalisation.
