 Abdur Harmacchi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Nov 16 (bdnews24.com)  Inflation is on the rise again, and predicted "to soar" after the reprieve of falling world prices, while high cost of living continuing to burden people's pockets. Point to point inflation reached an alarming level, crossing double digits in 2007 as food and fuel prices around the world rocketed. After peaking at over 11 percent in December that year, it started to drop through 2008 and shrank to 2.25 percent in June this year as prices of most essential commodities fell sharply on the recession-hit global market. But the first quarter of the fiscal has seen inflation rise again. It jumped to 3.46 percent then 4.69 percent in July and August. It fell slightly again in September to 4.60 percent. Economists have warned the government of further surges in inflation as international prices are going up again with the global recession easing. Last month, the International Monetary Fund warned point to point inflation in Bangladesh might cross double digits again toward the end of the current fiscal year. Last week, senior economist of World Bank's Dhaka office Zahid Hossain in a views exchange meeting said inflation might surge following price hike of commodities on the global market coupled with investment of thousands of crore of liquid money into the market. Implementation of a new pay scale for thousands of public servants announced this month may also contribute to the rising trend in inflation, some economists apprehend. Former finance secretary Akbar Ali Khan told bdnews24.com, "Global prices of essential products shrank to a tolerable level just after the present government came to power and so inflation came under control." But in recent months, prices of products have marked a steady rise, he said, adding that a bumper harvest of crops made no contribution to check the galloping price hikes. Khan said, "Prices of products spiralled up steeply ahead of Ramadan this year. Again, the prices of fuel oil and food products have increased on the global market." He expressed his fear that inflation might jump more in the coming days. "It is going to be the biggest challenge for the government to rein in inflation," he cautioned. Senior research director of Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies Zaid Bakht told bdnews24.com, "4.6 percent inflation rate is not so high but we can't afford for it to reach double digits." Zahid Hossain said, "Inflation will begin to surge if liquid money to the tune of Tk 38,000 crore starts pouring into the market along with the increasing trend of prices of commodities on the global market." Consumer Price Index still rising The country's top economists view that expenses continue to outweigh income. Zaid Bakht told bdnews24.com, "Cost of living will keep soaring unless purchasing power of the people is enhanced by generating massive employment." He said, "The country achieved about 6 percent GDP growth over the past few years but a handful of rich people enjoyed the yield of the growth depriving the vast majority of poor people of its boon." An analysis of the Consumer Price Index of Bangladesh demonstrates that the cost of a product which was worth Tk 206.86 last July had jumped to Tk 214.01 in July this year. The same product cost Tk 186.66 during July of FY 2007-08 and Tk 169.54 during the same period of FY 2006-07. According to the estimate, cost of living increased by 7.15 percent over the last year, 27.35 percent in the past two years and 44.47 percent in three years. Food items have gone up more steeply however. The food which cost Tk Tk 231.42 in July of 2009 was selling at Tk 223.94, Tk 196.57 and Tk 176.43 respectively during the same period of the previous three years (2008,2007,2006). The central bank statistics show prices of essential non-food items are going up along those of food items. Among non-food items, transportation cost has increased the most. The service, which cost Tk 227.44 during July of 2009, would be worth Tk 219.90, Tk 209.49 and Tk 210.15 during the same period of the previous three years (2008, 2007, and 2006). Health services that were worth Tk 193.35 in July 2009, cost Tk 178.49 during the same period three years ago. Furniture which cost Tk 162.61 three years ago is now selling at Tk 208.21. The number of impoverished people is increasing gradually, says Zaid Bakht. He told bdnews24.com, "The purchasing power of people would rise if everyone got the benefit of economic growth and ultimately there would be positive results in poverty alleviation." On the issue, the finance minister AMA Muhith told bdnews24.com, "Poverty alleviation is a major agenda the government we will continue with our efforts to remove poverty." Muhith said the poor are protected by the social safety network coverage of the government through different programmes like VGD, VGF and others. The FY 2009-10 budget has given a big chunk of allocation to help the poor survive through the year, Muhith said. He said efforts are also on to generate massive employment opportunities by boosting investment to enhance purchasing power of the people. bdnew
