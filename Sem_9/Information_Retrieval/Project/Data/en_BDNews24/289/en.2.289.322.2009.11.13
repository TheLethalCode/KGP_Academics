<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com)  Bangla Lion Communications launched experimental WiMAX operations on Thursday. The Dhaka-based Bangla Lion is only the second operator in the country to introduce WiMAX this after Augere Wireless Broadband Bangladesh, majority owned by UK-based Augere Holdings, earlier this month. Chairman of Bangla Lion Abdul Mannan inaugurated the high-speed wireless internet service by teleconference from Gulshan. Bangla Lion WiMAX branded vehicles toured the city though the day, exhibiting the service at several spots. The company says it is hopeful of reaching customers in the capital in a very short time with competitive rates. Bangla Lion obtained a BTCL license to operate WiMAX, or Broadband Wireless Access, in September 2008. It has launched its operation after 14 months, failing to meet the original 6-month deadline. Three companies won licenses at a BTCL auction on Sept 25 2008, paying Tk 215 crore each. The third company Brac Bdmail Network Ltd later pulled out. bdnews2
