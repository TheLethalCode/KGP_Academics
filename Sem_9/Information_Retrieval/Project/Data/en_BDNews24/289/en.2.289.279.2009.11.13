<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com)The government will not provide free food under its VGF programme, except to physically challenged, elderly people and widows, food minister Abdur Razzak said Thursday. He said the decision was made to discourage "dependency on the government". Around 70-75% of the recipients of the Vulnerable Group Feeding programme, will have to buy food at a token price, the minister told reporters after a Food Planning and Monitoring committee meeting at the ministry. "A minimum price will be charged for the rest." The charge would be nominal, he said. "Around Tk 4 to 5 per kg, not more than Tk 5." "The government does not want these people to be dependent on the government." "Moreover, the government has to raid the development budget of other sectors to use the money here. That's why we decided on a token price," Razzak said. Asked when the decision would be implemented, the minister said, "A VGF programme is already running." "A list is now being prepared of physically challenged, elderly and widows who will receive free VGF food." He said upazila and union level committees were formed to identify this population. "The list will soon be finalised." He said the new decision will be implemented from the next VGF programme. Razzak also said that corruption, mismanagement and favouritism occurred in some cases. "But the government will not stop the programme for that." Finance minister AMA Muhith, agriculture minister Matia Chowdhuryand director general of the food directorate Pius Costa were present among others. bdnews2
