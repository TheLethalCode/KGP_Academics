<TITLE> India says needs no help to heal Pakistan ties </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India on Wednesday said it needs no external help to improve ties with neighbour Pakistan, in a testy response to a statement issued by the United States and China. New Delhi is sensitive to what it perceives as any outside interference in its regional diplomacy, especially over Pakistan and the fate of the disputed Kashmir region. The United States and China issued a joint statement after President Barack Obama met his Chinese counterpart Hu Jintao, which included a line of support for the improvement of India-Pakistan relations. "Government of India is committed to resolving all outstanding issues with Pakistan through a peaceful bilateral dialogue," an Indian Foreign Ministry statement said. "A third country role cannot be envisaged nor is it necessary." Ties between the South Asian rivals dived after last year's Mumbai attacks, which India blamed on Pakistan-based militants and said were supported by some official agencies. India has also kept a wary eye on China as an old dispute over an Indian border state has flared in recent months. New Delhi also baulks at Chinese support for projects in Pakistan and a policy of issuing separate visas to Indian Kashmiris.
