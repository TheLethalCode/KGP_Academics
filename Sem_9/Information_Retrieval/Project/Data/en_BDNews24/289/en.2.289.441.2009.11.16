 Manila, Nov 16 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh is set to receive $12 million from the Asian Development Fund to tap its tourism potential for inclusive and sustainable growth. The loan, approved Monday, is part of the ADF's South Asia Tourism Infrastructure Development Project. India will get $20 million, Nepal will get a grant of $12.75 million and a loan of $12.75 million, under the same project. "Tourism plays an important role in the regional economy and this project will benefit around 2.4 million people through increased income and employment, health and environmental improvements, and reduced travel time," said Glfer Cezayirli, principal urban development specialist in ADB's South Asia Department. "The project features a subregional approach to tourism development that will bring wider benefits than a single country approach, and will help spread jobs and income to areas currently bypassed by existing tourism markets." "It includes a program to ensure that poor and remote communities have the knowledge and skills to take advantage of new tourism opportunities." The project will target transport and other infrastructure upgrades and will improve water supply, sanitation and solid waste management services to enhance the environment at key sites. Support will be given to increase the capacity of sector agencies to sustainably manage and protect attractions, while steps will be taken to increase involvement by local communities in the tourism sector. Countries in the sub-region, including India, Nepal and Bangladesh have formed a working group for collective action to tap the synergies of their complementary tourism sites in order to expand tourism. Nepal's ministry of tourism and civil aviation, India's Sikkim state department of tourism, and Bangladesh's department of archaeology, ministry of cultural affairs will execute the project and that is due for completion by September 2014. Along with ADB's loans and grants, the governments of the three countries, and the OPEC Fund for International Development, will provide the balance of the project cost of $89.5 million
