Following the mission by Atlantis, which is scheduled to last 11 days, NASA plans five more flights to complete the station. The shuttle is being replaced by a capsule-style spacecraft called Orion that can travel to the moon and other places in the solar system in addition to the space station, which orbits about 225 miles above Earth. The station, a $100 billion project of 16 nations, has been under construction for more than a decade. Atlantis' six-man crew includes commander Charles Hobaugh, pilot Barry Wilmore, flight engineer Randy Bresnik, lead spacewalker Michael Foreman and astronauts Leland Melvin and Robert Satcher.
