<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com)--BNP has accused the government of trying to wipe Ziaur Rahman's family out from politics by bombarding it with cases against them. "BNP and the Zia family cannot be removed from politics by bringing charges this way. Scores of such attempts in the past failed," secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said on Friday. He made this accusation at the inauguration of a week-long programme organised by BNP's student wing Jatiyabadi Chhatra Dal to mark senior joint secretary general Tarique Rahman's 45th birthday at Ramna Restaurant in the capital. Delwar wished fast recovery of Tarique, the elder son for BNP chief Khaleda Zia. Tarique's 45th birthday is on Nov 20. He also claimed the government is persecuting opposition activists. "The persistence shown by the government to destroy BNP is making us fear that the country is headed towards a single-party rule." The secretary general commented that BNP cannot be expelled from politics though lies and false cases. He also brought up the subject of new cases and submission of charge sheets in old cases against former prime minister Khaleda Zia, and their two sons. Delwar harshly criticised the government's dual policy on removing cases filed under past administrations for political persecution. The 293 'political harassment' cases recommended for withdrawal on Thursday did not include a single case against a BNP member, he pointed out. The celebration programmes will end at Tarique's parental home in Bogra, with Khaleda and other leaders in attendance. The week-long programme started off with a painting competition participated by 30 children. BNP joint secretary general Abdullah Al Noman, organisational secretary Amanullah Aman and others also spoke at the programme chaired by the JCD president Sultan Salauddin Tuku. bdn
