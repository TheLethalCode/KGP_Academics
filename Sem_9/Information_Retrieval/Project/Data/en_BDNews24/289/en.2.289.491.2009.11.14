<TITLE> Sri Lanka eye win in landmark Tendulkar Test </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 AHMEDABAD, India, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka will have to curb an inspired Sachin Tendulkar, on the threshold of another landmark, as they attempt to win a Test series in India for the first time. Sri Lanka have not won any of the 14 matches they have played in India since their first Test visit in 1982, but skipper Kumar Sangakkara feels has the potential to pull off a surprise in the three-Test series. Sri Lanka are second behind South Africa in the official Test rankings and are looking to extend their winning streak after defeating Pakistan and New Zealand at home by identical 2-0 margins in July and August. To achieve this, however, they will have to contend with Tendulkar's hot form and a strong home side that is rallying to give the record-breaking batsman a winning start to his 21st year in international cricket. Tendulkar, 36, will join a list of 15 players whose international careers have spanned more than 20 years when he plays in the first Test starting at the Motera on Monday. The Mumbai batsman holds the record for most Test runs (12,773), Test centuries (42), ODI runs (17,178) and ODI centuries (45) and hit a stirring 175 in the ODI series against Australia this month to underline his good form. "I am enjoying my game and there is a lot of cricket left in me," Tendulkar told reporters this week. Tendulkar made his Test debut as a chubby, curly-haired 16-year-old against Pakistan in Karachi on Nov, 15 1989. "You run out of superlatives for Sachin," Sangakkara told a news conference on Sri Lanka's arrival. Sri Lanka are missing the express pace of Lasith Malinga and the tourists are banking on all-rounder Angelo Mathews to lend balance to an attack led by record-breaking spinner Muttiah Muralitharan. BETTER PREPARED Spinner Ajantha Mendis proved a handful for the Indians when they were beaten 2-1 in the Test series on their tour of Sri Lanka last year. Only Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene and Tillakaratne Dilshan in a strong batting line-up have Test experience in India although Thilan Samaraweera is in excellent form. "(The) Sri Lankans are a better-prepared side now and can give the Indians (a) tough time during the series," India batsman Vangipurappu Laxman said this week. Dilshan suffered a sprained ankle at practice on Wednesday but is expected to play in the first Test. Sri Lanka go into the series without sufficient match practice after their tour opener against an Indian Board President's XI was abandoned without a ball being bowled due to rain. Sri Lanka lost 2-0 on their previous tour in 2005. The hosts, who have been strengthened by the return of left-arm paceman Zaheer Khan from a lengthy injury layoff, suffered a one-day series defeat to Australia this month. Sangakkara said the pressure was on India. "We have a lot of work to do but we are here to do well and try and win and change all this never winning a Test match in India," he said. "Responsibility is on India to stop us from doing tha
