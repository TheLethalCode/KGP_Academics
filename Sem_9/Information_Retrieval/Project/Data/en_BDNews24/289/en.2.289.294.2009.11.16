 Dhaka, Nov 16 (bdnews24.com)--The High Court has directed police to question former deputy minister in the BNP government, Abdus Salam Pintu, at jail gate in the case regarding the bomb blast case at Narayanganj Awami League office. The bench of justices A F M Abdur Rahman and Mohammed Imdadul Haque Azad gave the order on Monday on a petition filed by Pintu. Additional attorney general A K M Zahirul Haque told reporters they would appeal against the ruling. Barrister Rafique-ul-Huq argued for the BNP leader. At least 20 people were killed in the bomb blast in Narayanganj AL office on June 16, 2001. Narayanganj AL general secretary Khokan Saha filed the case. Arrested on Jan 17, 2008, Pintu is currently behind bars in connection with the Aug 21, 2004 grenade attack on an AL rally at Bangabandhu Avenue. bdne
