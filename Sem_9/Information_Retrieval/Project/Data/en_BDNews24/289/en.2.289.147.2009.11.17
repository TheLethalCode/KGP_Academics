<TITLE> Road through Azimpur graveyard illegal: HC </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com)--The High Court has declared illegal the construction of a link road through Azimpur Graveyard in the capital. The bench of justices Anwarul Haque and AH M Shamsuddin Chowdhury on Tuesday gave the ruling upon a petition of Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh, a human-rights organisation. In 2006, former BNP MP Nasir Uddin Ahmed Pintu's contracting firm began work on a link road by breaking graves, touching off anger among the local residents. The petition was filed after the media carried reports on the issue. A separate High Court bench on July 3 this year clamped an injunction on the construction work. The petitioner's lawyer Manzil Morshed said at the hearing that Dhaka City Corporation, the caretaker of the graveyard, is destroying it to construct the road, which is illegal. Advocate Hasanat Kaiyum represented Dhaka Corporation and deputy attorney general Abdus Salam Mondal the government. bdnews24.c
