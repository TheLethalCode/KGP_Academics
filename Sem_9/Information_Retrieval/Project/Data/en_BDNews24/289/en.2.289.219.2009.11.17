 Dhaka, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com)--Home minister Sahara Khatun on Tuesday said no "crossfire killings" have taken place since the current government took office, hours after the High Court questioned the government about unlawful deaths. The court gave the government and Rapid Action Battalion 48 hours to explain the shooting and killing of two brothers in Madaripur, asking why the deaths should not be ruled extra-judicial. Sahara told reporters at the secretariat, "There has been no crossfire since our government has taken office. "We're not killing (people) in crossfire," she stressed. Brothers Lutfor Khalashi, 40, and Khairul Khalashi, 38, both alleged to be extremists, were killed in what RAB said was "an exchange of gunfire" in Madaripur early on Monday. The deaths were reported just 36 hours after family members voiced fears that the two might be killed in custody. The home ministry has repeatedly rejected concerns of human rights organisations from home and abroad. The current government, like previous administrations, says law enforcers only fire weapons in defence, and deaths by shooting occur only where the suspect has been armed and exchange of gunfire takes place. Such incidents are often referred to as "crossfire" killings in the media and common parlance, a term that has come to imply suspicious, or extra-judicial, killings. More than 80 people have been killed in 'crossfire/encounter/shootout' incidents in the first nine months of the Awami League-led government, according to human rights group 'Odhikar'. The 'crossfire' issue came to the fore after formation of the elite force Rapid Action Battalion on Mar 26, 2004. In five years, some 577 people have been killed in 'crossfire' in 472 incidents since the elite force's inception, RAB has said. Also asked by reporters about "arrests without warrants" on Tuesday, the minister, "No mass arrests have been made during this government's tenure. Investigations will be carried out if we get such information." bdnew
