 Abdur Rahim Harmacchi bdnews24.com. senior correspondent Dhaka, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh is holding strong amid the global economic upheaval, the government insists, but it's not all good news. The economy presents a mixed bag of indicators at present. Though some, mainly foreign exchange reserve and remittance, are obviously booming, othersproductive imports and investment, among themare sluggish. Inflation appears under control, though it has been predicted to hit double digits next year. Revenue collection is up. The capital market is poised for its largest ever issue. Export earnings and remittance inflow appear to have belied wide speculation that the two sectors would suffer major blows because of the global slump. Though export earnings have shrunk, the downturn is less than forecast by some quarters, while the government has set aside sizable allocations in the budget as stimulus packages for the recession-hit export sectors. Meanwhile remittance is rising. And, as prices dropped on the recession-hit world market and good domestic farm outputrice import has dropped almost to zeroimport costs plummeted. Though this appears to include a drop in productive imports. High remittance and low import costs have led the forex reserve to break all records this month by crossing the $10 billion mark for the first time. Finance minister AMA Muhith and Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman, highlighting strong remittance and reserve, view the economy moving in a positive direction despite global recession. They say it reflects well for foreign investment. Economists agree, on the whole, but advise the government to revamp investment and industry instead of being complacent with success in these two areas alone. On current state of Bangladesh economy, AMA Muhith told bdnews24.com,"Except investment, our economy now stands on a solid foundation." The world recession has not hit as hard as predicted, he said. "Yet we are monitoring the global situation round the clock and taking action as necessary," Muhith said, referring to the government's various stimulus packages for export sectors. Central bank boss Atiur Rahman said Bangladesh "is one of the four countries which are doing well amid global recession". The others he cited were India, China and Brazil. "It is a matter of prestige for us as a nation," he said. "Bangladesh is combating the onslaught with great courage." Economist and former caretaker adviser Akbar Ali Khan said, "Recession has proved a boon to Bangladesh in that our foreign exchange reserve has inflated with lower import cost of fuel, fertiliser and food products on the global market." But he advised the government to revitalise investment and industry instead of being "self-contented". Khan also warned that fuel and food prices were on the rise again on the global market with the recession beginning to ease. "The biggest challenges ahead of the government are to generate employment by investment in industry and curbing price hikes," he said. Remittance, reserve rocket upward On Nov 11, the central bank's forex reserve smashed all previous records to cross the $10 billlion mark. It stood over $9 billion for the previous four months. Much of the credit for the strong reserve goes to overseas workers and farmers, says the Bangladesh Bank boss. Remittance of $3.6 billion flowed into the country during the first four months (July-Oct) of the fiscal year, up 21.25 percent from the same period last year. At the outset of the global recession, donor agencies World Bank, IMF and ADB predicted that remittance inflow to Bangladesh would dip significantly. But Bangladeshis working abroad, many of whom face hardships abroad in order to send more money home to families, belied their forecasts. Meanwhile, bumper farm output last year brought rice imports down to near-zero this year. In support of farmers, Bangladesh Banks farm loan policy has seen Tk 19 billion disbursed in farm loans in the first quarter of the year and the figure was Tk 575.35 crore for the same period of the last year. Import costs plummet Import costs dropped by more than 19 per cent in the first quarter (July-Sept) of the fiscal year. In the same period last year the country's import spending rose by 35 percent compared to the 2007-08. Bangladesh economists have been sounding a warning bell that falling import costs and the resulting inflated reserve also reflect a drop in productive imports. The available data for July-August showed that imports of both capital machinery and raw materials declined 22 percent in value in the first two months of the current fiscal year. The Bangladesh Bank has yet to release the break-up of data for the third month of the first quarter, but the governor told bdnews24.com that capital machinery imports "have been on the rise since September". The governor also suggested, earlier this year, that $500 million of foreign exchange reserves should be invested in the government's public-private partnership initiative for infrastructure projects. Export earnings wane Export earnings fell 11.6 percent in the first quarter. The same period last year saw five percent growth in export earnings. BGMEA figures show exports of readymade garments, the country's largest export earner, dropped by 9.71 percent in July-Sept of the current fiscal year, from the same period last year. The government's total export earnings target for FY2010 is $1,760 crore, up 13 percent from last year's. It is expected that almost 80 percent of export earnings will come from the garment sector. Inflation up and down Point to point inflation has been dropping this year from the highs of last year. Inflation rose to a high of 11.59 percent in December 2007 following price hikes of fuel and food on the global market. It shrunk down to 6.03 percent in December 2008. Since then, it dropped to 2.25 percent in June this year, but has been on the rise again. It was 3.46 percent in July, rising to 4.69 percent in August. It dipped slightly in September to 4.60 percent. IMF recently predicted inflation would hit double digits again by June next year. Capital market swings The capital market appears to be on an upswing with new shares and investors pouring into the market. Grameenphone shares are expected to hit the bourses on Nov 16, in the biggest issue the country has ever seen. Dhaka Stock Exchange hit an all time high above 3400 points on Nov 2 and around Tk 10 billion is being transacted every day. But just 10 days later, retail investors staged demonstrations in front of the DSE, calling for the bourse chief to resign as share prices saw the biggest single-day fall in more than four months. Regulators and analysts continue to urge caution as the still immature market sees rapid 'overheating' at times, and subsequent market corrections often leave small investors in the cold. Mirza Azizul Islam, a former finance adviser, has said, "The government wants to take the capital market to a better position." But, he complained, the market was neglected as an economic tool. "Government officials do not have sufficient idea of how the capital market can play a crucial role in the country's economic development." bd
