 Gopalganj, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com)--The commerce minister fears 'conspirators' may try to upset security to stop execution of the pending final verdict on the murder trial of independence architect 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. "The government along with the people is alert to the danger," Faruq Khan said on Friday at a freshers' reception and scholarship-awarding ceremony at Muksudpur College in Gopalganj. The Supreme Court set Nov 19 for the final verdict after completing its hearing over the appeals by death convicts on Thursday. The apex court began hearing arguments in Bangabandhu murder appeals hearing that began on Oct 15 after completion of presentation of paper book. He claimed that price of commodities will not increase due to the announcement of new pay scale. The minister said stockpiling has been mounted on import of many essentials, including sugar and edible oil. He also said the government will take initiatives with the businesmen to keep the price of commodities within the people's purchasing power. bdnews
