 Dhaka, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com)  There will be no bar to movement or disruption to daily life, though law enforcers are ready to tackle any security situation regarding the last stage of the Bangabandhu murder trial, the home minister said on Wednesday. "Though security has been tightened in the capital and rest of the country, no 'red alert' has been issued," Sahara Khatun told reporters after a meeting at the Secretariat. Law enforcing agencies were on alert everywhere, ready to tackle any untoward situation, she said. "But there is no need to panic," said the home minister. "There is no bar in the movement of the public. Law enforcers will search only those they deem suspicious," she said. On whether the government fears any acts of sabotage the minister said: "Nothing will happen Inshallah (by the grace of God). "The law enforcers are following our directions." The home minister on Tuesday held talks in two phases with MPs, administration, police officials of the capital and its surrounding areas, inspector general of police, RAB director general, special branch and heads of law enforcing agencies. A security blanket has already been thrown over the Supreme Court premises, trial court premises and diplomatic areas, Sahara said on Tuesday. Ruling Awami League also asked its supporters not to go "overboard" and stage rallies and processions once the final verdict on the murder trial is out.
