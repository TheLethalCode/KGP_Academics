Russia's Federal Security Service said a fire broke out at 1300 GMT when soldiers attempted to decommission munitions at navy Arsenal No. 31 on the outskirts of Ulyanovsk, a city of 625,000 people, 800 km (500 miles) southeast of Moscow.

The Prosecutor-General's main investigative unit said in a statement that a criminal case had been opened for negligence and breaching rules on handling weapons.
