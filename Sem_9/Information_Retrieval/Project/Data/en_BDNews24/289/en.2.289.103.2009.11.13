 PESHAWAR, Pakistan Fri Nov 13,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide car-bomber destroyed an office of Pakistan's main intelligence agency in the northwestern city of Peshawar on Friday, killing at least eight people and wounding over 30, witnesses and officials said. Militants have stepped up attacks on security forces including a commando-style raid and hostage-taking at the army's headquarters in Rawalpindi last month.

They were able to approach a gate of the sprawling headquarters complex but did not get through, as they had apparently intended. Instead, they took hostages at a security office just outside the headquarters. The army went on the offensive last month in South Waziristan, a lawless ethnic Pashtun region, aiming to root out Pakistani Taliban militants behind a wave of violence in urban areas. The militants have responded with intensified attacks in towns and cities, killing several hundred peo
