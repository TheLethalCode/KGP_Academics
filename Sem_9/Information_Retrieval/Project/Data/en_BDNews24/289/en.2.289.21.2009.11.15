 Abdur Rahim Harmacchi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)  As some indicators go from strength to strength, an alarming inertia persists in both local and foreign investment, while idle funds risk raising inflationary pressures. The finance minister, central bank governor and the country's economists all echo the same concern, that the biggest challenge for the Bangladesh economy is to divert huge amounts of excess liquidity into productive investment. At the start of the year, low investment in the country was a legacy of a two-year period of emergency coupled with the caretaker government's anti-corruption crackdown against businessmen, among others. But business leaders and economists point out that those particular investment barriers disappeared with the newly elected government taking the reins in January this year. And yet stagnancy in investment still prevails with the year ending, they sayThey also hold that inertia in investment will persist unless there are improvements in infrastructure, bureaucratic complexities and law and order. Finance minister AMA Muhith has acknowledged the challenges ahead in a recent speech in parliament. He told bdnews24.com this week, "Investment stagnancy still persists mainly due to two reasons: one is the installation of a new government and so local investors are still taking a 'wait and see' approach." The other is global recession which has dampened overseas investment, he said. "So we are focused on wooing local investors, as foreign investors will stay clear until local investment is revamped," he said. Poor local investment has been reflected in falling imports of capital machinery and raw materials for industry. Both fell by 22 percent during the first quarter. But Bangladesh Bank has said productive imports have been on the rise again from September, though it has yet to release figures. Foreign Direct Investment dropped to $126 million during July-August of the current fiscal year, while the figure hit $201 million during the same period of last fiscal year. Figures available up to August indicate that loan disbursement in to the private sector had not improved during July-August period; rather it marks a decline. Meanwhile, just 10 percent of the Annual Development Programme was implemented during the first quarter (July-Sept). FBBCI president Annisul Haq said, "Local investment will not rise unless gas and electricity crises, stifling bureaucracy and high interest rates are addressed." He urged the government to pay attention to the issues. Former commerce minister Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury believes there are other issues too. "Gas and power crises are not the major issues. Rather, law and order insecurity mainly stands in the way of investment." Muhith said, "We have already launched steps to combat high interest rate and bureaucratic complexities which are a major hurdle to raise investment" "We are moving to address the gas and electricity crises," he said. The government is also taking measures to ensure industrial security. Muhith was also optimistic as import of capital machinery showed a rise in September. "This is undoubtedly a good sign, which indicates that investment is about to pick up," he said Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman also told bdnews24.com that the wheels of investment were turning again. He said, positive signs were apparent in industrial and service sectors alongside agriculture. Along with capital machinery, imports of raw materials are on the rise as are large loans, he said. Rahman has also suggested that part of the A joint survey launched by Bangladesh Investment Climate Fund and International Chamber of Commerce-Bangladesh indicates that though the first three quarters of the calendar year (Jan-Sept) saw low business and investment, the last quarter (Oct-Dec) is expected to see one-third growth. The BIF-Bangladesh Business Survey 2009: Reflection of Opinions of Businessmen, released on Nov 5, interviewed 778 business firms in different parts of the country from July-September. Former caretaker adviser Wahid Uddin Mahmud said different sectors of economy including investment are slow-moving due to diverse problems. But he welcomed the view of businessmen in that the sluggish trend was lifting toward the end of the year. The finance minister said, "Investment inertia resulting from intimidation and harassment of businessmen by the last care-taker government is yet to lift." We are trying to overcome the slump down and expecting to overcome it at the beginning of next year. bd
