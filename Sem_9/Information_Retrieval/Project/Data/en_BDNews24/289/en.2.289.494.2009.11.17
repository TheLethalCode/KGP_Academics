 Chittagong, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com)  Two factions of BNP supporters in Chittagong called separate protest rallies on Tuesday following clashes the previous day that broke up the metropolitan unit's long overdue council. Supporters of BNP joint secretary general Abdullah Al Noman and convenor of the metropolitan unit Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury blamed each other for Monday's untoward occurrences at the Institute of Engineers, Chittagong where the scheduled council dissolved in chaos as the two factions faced off. A series of clashes fuelled by internal squabbling foiled the council of BNP's Chittagong metropolitan unit on Monday, attempted after a hiatus of 20 years. The two leaders said they would go to Dhaka, meet the party chairperson Khaleda Zia and central leaders and discuss the situation. Noman left Chittagong Tuesday morning. Amir Khasru said he would meet the party chief on Wednesday. Supporters of Noman, meanwhile, announced a protest rally in front of the metropolitan BNP office at Nasiman Building at around 4pm Tuesday. Amir Khasru's supporters announced rallies in different wards the same afternoon. MA Sabur, one of Noman's supporters and president of BNP's Kotwali unit, told bdnews24.com they have called on their workers and supporters to protest "the attack on the council and propaganda maligning their leader". b
