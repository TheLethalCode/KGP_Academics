<TITLE> Make toilets cool to fix sanitation woes, expert says </TITLE>

 MUMBAI, Nov 16, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jack Sim, founder of the World Toilet Organisation, has a theory about why governments and people are so reluctant to talk about hygiene: it isn't cool.

But they need to think beyond just building more toilets that are seldom maintained and get taken over by encroachers, he said. WTO, along with consumer goods maker Hindustan Unilever, has launched a pilot programme on some premium Rajdhani Express trains to keep the toilets clean in return for advertising space. "This is an example of market factors solving a big problem," said Carolyn Jones, global hygiene manager at Unilever. "It is a sensitive issue, but a serious one that has to be a shared responsibility of the government, companies and peop
