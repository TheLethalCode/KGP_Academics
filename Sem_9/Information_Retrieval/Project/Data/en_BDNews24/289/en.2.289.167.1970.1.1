 Dhaka, Nov 16 (bdnews24.com)Factional clashes broke up the long overdue council of BNP's Chittagong metropolitan unit on Monday. The council, due to begin at 10am at the Institute of Engineers Chittagong Centre, dissolved in chaos as two factions faced off. Two groups of supporters, backing BNP joint secretary general Abdullah Al Noman and convenor of the metropolitan unit Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury, fought as the Noman group tried to enter the auditorium at around 11am. Chairs were thrown, while at one point Noman's followers surrounded invited guests and other BNP leaders. Police eventually brought the situation under control but guests, who'd seen enough, began leaving the venue around midday. Chowdhury's announcement of the council, the first in 20 years, had already brought internal conflicts of local party leaders to the fore on Sunday. On the eve of the council, Noman's supporters declared they would hold a separate council at the nearby Ladies Club as a challenge to Chowdhury. MA Sabur, joint convenor of metropolitan BNP and president of the Kotwali committee, round which the rival faction is centred, told bdnews24.com on Sunday, "We'll march to the Engineers Institute from the central office and if there's any protest, we'll move to the Ladies Club and hold our council there." The last council of the Chittagong metropolitan committee was held in 1988, electing Noman president. BNP central leaders reconstituted the metropolitan committee in 1997, selecting Mir Mohammad Nasir Uddin and Dastagir Chowdhury as its president and general secretary. The committee was dissolved in May 2005 after Nasir lost the mayoral elections and a convening committee was later announced headed by former whip Syed Wahidul Alam which was also reconstituted in line with the other BNP committees in June last year
