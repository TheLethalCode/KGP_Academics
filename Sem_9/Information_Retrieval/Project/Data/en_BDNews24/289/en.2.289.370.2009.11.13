<TITLE> Conjoined Bangladeshi twins go under the knife Monday </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Melbourne, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com)--A 16-strong medical team will begin a mammoth, long-awaited operation to separate the conjoined Bangladeshi twins Trishna and Krishna at 8.30am local time in Melbourne, Australia, on Monday, The Age newspaper reports. Members of the team gathered at the Royal Children's Hospital on Friday to admit to their nerves, and describe the operation that has been two years in the making. "There's a lot of trepidation and nervousness amongst the team getting to this point through all the work that has gone into managing these two gorgeous girls," the hospital's chief of surgery, Leo Donnan, was quoted as saying by the Australian newspaper. The surgery to separate the girls, who are approaching their third birthday, is the culmination of several lead-up operations. Blood vessels were separated and tissue expanders inserted to grow more skin to cover the girls' new scalps. Neurosurgeon Wirginia Maixner on Thursday gave the girls a one-in-four chance of coming through alive and without any significant brain injury. There was a one-in-four chance they would die, and a 50 per cent chance of brain damage. "I am actually more optimistic than that," she said. "But there are significant challenges ahead that we can't under-estimate." When the operation begins, the first tricky role is for the anaesthetic team, led by Drs Ian McKenzie and Andrew Davidson. Conjoined twins pose unique problems for anaesthetists, because of the shared blood flow. Once the patients are asleep and their skulls apart, Ms Maixner will take charge, separating the few remaining veins that the girls share as well as a "small bridge" of connected brain tissue. About 12 hours after the 8.30am start, if all goes well, the twins will technically be separate. Once the separation is complete, the plastic surgeons take over, led by Andrew Greensmith and Professor Tony Holmes. They face a tough job to close the dinner-plate-sized holes left in the twins' heads, Mr Greensmith said. First the brain lining, or dura, must be given a water-tight seal using a synthetic material. Then the bone itself will be closed up using a plastic 'cap' to make up for the lack of real bone, to protect the children from trauma as well as the effects of changing air pressure. Finally the skin, which has been grown over the inserts to produce extra surface area, will be sealed over the top. The inserts have gradually been inflated and now contain almost two litres of fluid - equivalent to a soccer ball, so there should be enough skin to completely close over the two skulls. Maixner said over the years since they arrived in Melbourne the twins had "blossomed into these delightful toddlers". "It's really incredible," she said. "It reminds you how much they need to be apart. They need to develop normally." The biggest risks in the operation were concern about how Krishna's kidney would react to the operation, how the skin closure would come together, and how the twins' systems would respond to their separation. The operation should be all over by midnight Monday. By Wednesday, doctors will perform scans to see how the operation has gone, and if all seems well they will start to wake the twins up to their new, separate lives. "But it will be at least a week, minimum, before we know we are out of the woods," Maixner said. She said she had never imagined that in her life she would have the chance to perform such a rare operation. "I am excited and I have a little bit of trepidation, I know it will be a long day," she said. She plans a long night's sleep on Sunday. Moira Kelly from the Children's First Foundation, who brought the twins to Australia for the operation, said in a statement the medical and nursing staff at the RCH had been her "constant source of hope during some extraordinary and enormous challenges, when at times it seemed to be beyond the strength of two very little girls". "I invite my own people, people of Australia, of all the beautiful faiths represented in our beautiful country to join together in prayer for our two little girls and for Wirginia, Andrew and Ian and their teams as they undertake the operation of their lives, to give the gift of life and separation to two very deserving and beautiful little girls," she said. "Trishna and Krishna could not be in more loving han
