<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Chhatra League activists reportedly beat up Shahbag flower traders and vandalised their shops on Saturday after being refused extortion money. Local traders alleged a gang of residential students from Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Hall, led by Chhatra League central leader Tarek Shikdar, smashed up at least five flower shops and beaten them five of the owners in the afternoon. They claimed Tarek was regularly extorting money from the semi-permanent flower stalls at Shahbagh, on the edge of the Dhaka University campus. When the flower traders refused to pay up any more, the BCL leader became furious, they said. Later, he brought supporters from the Dhaka University hall, beat the traders and vandalised the shops, they said. BCL leaders, however, said it was the businessmen who together beat up Tarek after he had accidentally driven over a trader's foot with his motor bike. Later, when the news reached the hall, around 50 BCL activists rushed to the scene with metal bars and hockey sticks and wrecked the shops, beating up the people there, said leaders Chhatra League, the pro-ruling party student body. But the violence was nothing to do with Tarek, they claimed. BCL central committee general secretary Mahfuzul Haider Roton said, "I have yet heard about the incident yet. But strong steps will be taken against Chhatra League members if they were involved." Shahbag Police Station is situated right next to the flower bazaar, but police were simply onlookers in the incident, said witnesses. bdne
