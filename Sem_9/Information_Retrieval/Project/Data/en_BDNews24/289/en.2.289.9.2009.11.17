 Kushtia, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com)--Authorities of Kushtia Polytechnic Institute have asked the students to leave the halls following a bomb blast in one of the halls on Tuesday morning. Teachers visited the hall after the incident and in a meeting at noon decided to shut all the three halls. Male students were asked to leave by 2pm and females by 4pm. Joint convenor of the college unit of Bangladesh Chhatra League Tanvir Alam Parvez, 22, was injured when a bomb went off. He was passing by room no. 201 of Mir Mosharraf Hossain Hall. Students rescued and admitted him to the Kushtia General Hospital. His face and hands were burnt badly. Lutfar Rahman, principal of the institute, said the incident might be a sequel to a clash that took place a few days ago.
