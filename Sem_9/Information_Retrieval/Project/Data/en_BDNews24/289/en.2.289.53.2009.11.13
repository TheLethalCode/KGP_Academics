 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com)--A move is underway to carry goods-laden containers from India across the Bangabandhu Bridge over the river Jamuna to cut cost and time for imports from India, railway sources said. Bangladesh Railway has made a "special request" to the communications ministry for permission to carry Indian containers over the Bangabandhu Bridge which connects the capital with the north. Director general of Bangladesh Railway Md Belayet Hossain also reminded the government of securing railway transit facilities from India to carry goods to Nepal before approving the proposal. The railway's request follows India's repeated demands for allowing its cargo-laden containers to reach Dhaka straight across the bridge from the three bordering railway stations at Benapole, Darsana and Rahanpur. The stations are located in the western side of the multi-purpose bridge across the mighty Jamuna. If the government permits the container coming to Kamalapur station, the cost of imports from India would come down, railway officials told bdnews24.com. "We sent a letter to the ministry (communications) on Nov 10 for allowing us to carry the Indian containers over the Bangabandhu Bridge," Belayet Hossain, the railway chief, said last week. Talking to bdnews24.com at his office on Thursday, he said, "We cannot carry the containers without the approval from the government inspector on railways, and the government as a whole," he said. The government's railway inspector Abu Taher told bdnews24.com on Thursday that he was yet to receive any letter in this regard. "We will examine the railway's proposal in line with the railway act and give our opinion to the government through the communications ministry," Taher said, adding, "But we will not allow anything against the interest of the people." The railway DG said India proposed carrying four types of containers across the bridge, but his department found that two light models of container would not cross the weight limit of the tracts on the bridge. The railway tract on the bridge can carry up to 4.6 tonnes of weight per metre distance. But out of the four types, two models of Indian container have the weight load of 5.71 tonnes per metre. "Therefore, we rejected those two types of container to be plied across the bridge," said Hossain. Had the government approved the proposal, the locomotives of Bangladesh Railway could carry the cargo-laden containers up to the railway depot at Kamalapur station in the capital. The director general's letter mentioned that India at the inter-governmental railway meeting (IGRM) in March (6-8) 2007 had proposed carrying their containers across the bridge. India again raised the issue at the next IGRM held in Oct 8-10 the same year in New Delhi. Bangladesh at the two meetings had requested the Indian authorities for transit facilities to carry goods to Nepal, but the issue remained pending. At present, on an average one cargo train from India enters Bangladesh everyday, according to railway sources. Bangladesh Railway can carry goods to India-Nepal bordering stations of Raxaul and Jagbani through Birol-Radhikapur, Rahanpur-Singhabad and Chilahati-Haldibari transit points. The Chilahati-Haldibari transit point is the closest to the Nepal border from Bangladesh. Jagbani station is only 35 kilometres away from Chilahati-Haldibari border. Meanwhile, Mohammad Shahjahan, a joint-director general of Bangladesh Railway, told bdnews24.com on Thursday that the government would need to put in place some infrastructure to implement the Indian proposal. "We have to install scanners to check the contents of the containers for security reasons," said Shahjahan. "Besides, we need weighing machines at both sides of the bridge to measure the load of the containers," he said, adding the two sides would settle the issues after getting the government nod.
