 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com)  The recommendations on incentives for the apparel industry will be given approval by next Tuesday, finance minister AMA Muhith said Thursday. "The committee has submitted their suggestions and it has come to my hand today. It'll be approved [by] November 17," the minister told reporters at his office. The long-awaited stimulus package for the sector proposes up to 5 percent cash incentive for new markets other than the USA, EU and Canada; the support would be given over the next five years. Five and four percent cash incentives were proposed for the first and second years of exports respectively. The government's recession taskforce formed a nine-member working committee on Oct 15 to identify ways to support ready made garments, the country's largest export sector, and its backward linkage industries amid the global recession. Alongside cash incentives, it suggested opportunities for loan re-scheduling without down payment until June 2010, for those industries having faced loss in exports. The committee also recommended reduction in bank charges, though it conceded that Bangladesh Bank and the financial sector would have final say on the issue. Asked if the recommendations would stand, Muhith was non-committal. "I've not seen them in detail yet, but it was the government that formed the committee," he said. The government announced an incentive package earlier this year of Tk 3424 crore for export-oriented industries on the recommendations of the recession taskforce, but the garment industry was not included. Industry leaders have been lobbying for their own stimulus package since. BGMEA figures show exports of readymade garments dropped by 9.71% in the first three months of the current fiscal year, from the same period last year. September 2009 exports were down 26.93% from the same month last year. The government's total export earnings target for FY2010 is $1,760 crore, up 13% from last year's. It is expected that almost 80% of export earnings will come from the garment sector. bd
