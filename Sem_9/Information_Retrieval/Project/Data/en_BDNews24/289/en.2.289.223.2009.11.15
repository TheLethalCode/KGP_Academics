<TITLE> Microloan interest should come down: speaker </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)Speaker Abdul Hamid has suggested that NGOs cut their interest rate on microcredit. "Microcredit is good for the people, whether it is given by the municipality or NGO, but the NGOs should reduce the interest rate," he said at a discussion on Sunday. The municipal mayor and councillors remarked that the microcredit of the NGOs is making the poor even poorer. Bangladesh Pourosabha Samity (municipality association) organised the discussion on the Role of Municipalities in Poverty Alleviation at CIRDAP auditorium in Dhaka. He told the public representatives that they were elected on pledges and there would not be any conflict if they do their job properly in a transparent manner. Conflicts arise only when 'interest' is involved among the mayor-councillors or the local administration, he said. Only 10-20 percent of the 100-day programme taken up by the caretaker government was implemented, Hamid said. "Chairmen, members and UNOs pocketed the rest of the money." He said poverty could be eradicated only if corruption could be cut and population controlled. The chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on land ministry, AKM Mozammel Huq, criticised the interest rate imposed by the Grameen Bank on its microcredit. "Grameen Bank's interest rate stands at 49-65, which, I think, has triggered poverty. "Poverty cannot be removed in the way NGOs are giving loans. Their operations must be monitored." Huq also suggested handover of government lands including those under the railway and highways to the local government. Sarah Kobori MP said distribution of government funds must be ensured to develop the local government. Asaduzzaman Noor said, "Development of the local government as well as eradication of poverty will be possible if the works are done with proper planning, coordination and sincerity." Professor Salahuddin M Anisuzzaman of Dhaka University presented the keynote paper. He stressed formulating a comprehensive policy for the municipalities to inspire them into initiating microcredit projects. bdn
