 Dhaka, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com)The Detective Branch of Police say they have arrested three more Lashkar-e-Taiba members, a Kashmir-based militant organisation, suspected of planning attacks at the Indian and the US embassies in Dhaka. They were caught early on Friday from Uttara in capital Dhaka and Tongi of Gazipur, deputy commissioner of DB Manirul Islam told bdnews24.com. Arrestees Sufian Azhari, Zahid Hossain and Manirul Ali all have Pakistani passports. They were arrested on information gleaned from three others suspected LeT members caught last week. Azhari was arrested at Uttara, while Hossain and Ali were captured at Tongi, Islam added. Police claim Sufian, who had recently completed studies at the Gazipur Islamic Institute of Technology, was overseeing recruiting for LeT. Manirul told bdnews24.com, "These three persons are suspected of having links with a possible attack on the Indian and the US embassies in Bangladesh." Police said the fresh arrestees would be sent to the court to remand them into custody for questioning. A Dhaka court on Nov 6 granted police two days to grill three LeT suspects including the son of Mufti Izharul Islam, leader of a faction of Islami Oikya Jote. They were captured from Dampara in Chittagong the previous day. Detectives had arrested Emdadullah alias Mahbub, a suspected LeT member at Gabtoli in the capital on Oct 1. Lashkar-e-Taiba was accused of Mumbai attack in November last year. Indian intelligence agencies found Ajmal Amir Kasab's involvement with the Islamist outfit. bdnew
