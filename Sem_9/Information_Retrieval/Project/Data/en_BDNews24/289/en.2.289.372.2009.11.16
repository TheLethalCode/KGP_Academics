<TITLE> US tags TIFA to wider market access </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)The United States has tagged enhanced access of Bangladeshi products to its market to a Trade and Infrastructure Framework Agreement (TIFA) between the countries. Ambassador James F Moriarty at a meeting on Monday with the Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI) said that doors for discussion on such issues would further open once there is a TIFA. "One step that we can take to foster greater dialogue on entrepreneurship, market access and labor issues would be to sign a Trade and Infrastructure Framework Agreement," he told the meeting. Replying to a query from MCCI members, Moriarty said that nothing can be guaranteed without a TIFA. "I want to be very clear that the proposed TIFA would not affect existing international commitments relating to intellectual property rights or other areas," he added. On Bangladesh's concern over proposed enhanced market access for its competitors in readymade garments like Pakistan and Sri Lanka, Moriarty said, "We will take these concerns into account as we seek a balanced agreement that all parties' support." He said a key Congressional subcommittee is set to hold a hearing on the topic of extending or reforming the GSP programme of the US government. The current GSP programme, which benefits Bangladeshi exports in some ways, expires by the end of 2009. MCCI president Abdul Hafiz Choudhury in his opening speech urged the US to make an inclusive list with wider coverage of Bangladeshi products while renewing the GSP. "Top 30 export items of Bangladesh are not included on the US GSP list that accounts for 70 percent in value terms of Bangladesh's export to the US market," he said. Choudhury also suggested that the TIFA draft agreement be made public. "So that the stakeholders can have an informed and effective discussion for the resolution of differences," he said.
