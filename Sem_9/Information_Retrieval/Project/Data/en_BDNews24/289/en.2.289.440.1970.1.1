 Dhaka, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh is among the highest risers in Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index this year. It rose twelve places to rank 139 among 180 countries, coming among the nine countries that improved most from last year. Bangladesh's score rose to 2.4 from 2.1 last year, ranking joint 13th from bottom along with Pakistan, Belarus and Philippines. It also emerged from the '10 worst' list for the first time this year. Its 2.1 score last year was one of the ten worst on the 1-10 scale. Bangladesh previously ranked at the very bottom of the annual index, being perceived as the most corrupt country, for five successive years from 2001-2005. Transparency International Bangladesh executive director Iftekharuzzaman presented the annual corruption report at a press conference in Dhaka on Tuesday as TI released the 2009 index worldwide. The Berlin-based watchdog body cited important institutional and legal reforms made in 2008-09 to control corruption in Bangladesh. The 2009 CPI was calculated using data from 13 sources from 10 independent institutions. It includes surveys from 2008 and 2009. All sources measure the overall extent of corruption (frequency and/or size of bribes) in the public and political sectors, and all sources provide a ranking of countries, i.e. includes an assessment of multiple countries, says TI. New Zealand topped the list this year, scoring 9.4. Somalia scored 1.1 coming last. Denmark and Singapore came 2nd and 3rd from top, scoring 9.3 and 9.2 respectively. Afghanistan and Myanmar came 2nd and 3rd from bottom, scoring 1.3 and 1.4 respectively. Among other South Asian countries, Bhutan ranked 49 from top, India 84, Sri Lanka 97, Maldives 130 and Nepal 143. Their scores were 5.0, 3.4, 3.1, 2.5 and 2.3 respectively. b
