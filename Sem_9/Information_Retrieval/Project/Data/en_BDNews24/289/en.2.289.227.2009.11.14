 Dhaka, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com)--Foreign secretary Md Mijarul Quayes could not say Saturday whether Bangladesh and India would sign a Teesta water sharing agreement during prime minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to new Delhi in December. After talks with his visiting Indian counterpart Nirupama Rao, Quayes said the two sides had reiterated "expediting the process" of reaching an agreement on the Teesta river, over which Bangladesh has its largest irrigation project. The Indian foreign secretary arrived in Dhaka Saturday, on a two-day visit, to prepare the ground for Sheikh Hasina's visit in December. Rao also met prime minister Sheikh Hasina, foreign minister Dipu Moni and leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia. "I am not an astrologer," Quayes said when asked at a foreign ministry briefing whether the Teesta water deal would go ahead. "We can only expedite the process. This is a written commitment (of the two countries)." Sheikh Hasina will fly to Delhi on Dec 19 on a three-day visit, foreign minister Dipu Moni told bdnews24.com Thursday. The two countries had most recently agreed to "expedite the process" for a Teesta water sharing deal during Dipu Moni's India visit in September. "There are mechanisms for signing the deal. The meeting of the Joint River Commission is yet to take place," said Quayes. He said the technical experts of the two countries may sit in November to settle details. "We will hand over a draft copy of the agreement on Teesta water sharing to the Indian authorities," said Quayes. "We have more than one month in hand." Dhaka's need to reach an agreement with Delhi on the Teesta is pressing. Bangladesh's largest irrigation project, covering an area of 750,000 hectares of land, depends on the Teesta, a common river coming down from India. India diverts water in the upstream with its barrage in Gazoldoba. Every year, during the dry season, the Teesta faces a water crunch, leaving Bangladesh's rice producing Rangpur dry. Bangladesh says it cannot go ahead with the second phase of the Teesta irrigation project due to water shortage in the river. During Dipu Moni's India visit, Bangladesh and India also agreed to "immediately commence joint hydrological observations on the river".
