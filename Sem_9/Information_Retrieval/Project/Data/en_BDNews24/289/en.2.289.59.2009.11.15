 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)  Rural banking, especially for farmers, will be given the highest priority in Bangladesh Bank's five-year strategic plan from 2010-2014, deputy governor Murshid Kuli Khan said on Sunday. Small and medium enterprise will be given second priority after farmers, Khan told a press briefing at Bangladesh Bank Bhaban. The five-year plan, to be formally announced in the first week of January, aims to draw more people to banking services outside urban areas he said. According to central bank data, only 26 percent of the total population have savings accounts while just 6 percent receive loans from banks. Rural areas are the least served by banking services. Only 13 percent of the total deposits in the banking sector and 8 percent of loans disbursed are in rural areas. Though agriculture contributes 24 percent of the total GDP, only 7 percent of bank loans are distributed in the sector. Mentioning the central bank's existing focus on farmers, with an agricultural loan target of Tk 11,500 crore in the current fiscal year, Khan said the governor Atiur Rahman was travelling across the country to personally hand loans to farmers direct. "Already there has been a good response from the farmers. We hope it will affect the economy positively," said Khan. Meanwhile, commercial banks are still reluctant to deal with small and medium enterpreuners, based on misapprehensions, according to the SME Foundation chief. "The common misunderstanding is that the SMEs might fail to pay back loans," Aftab ul Islam, chairman of the SME Foundation told a meeting with a delegation of Chittagong Women Chamber of Commerce and Industry on Sunday Lack of capital and credit are serious constraints for small and medium start-ups. "The number of small entrepreneurs without access to credit is huge," said Islam. Bangladesh Bank's five-year plan is being prepared with advice from central bank officials of all, the finance ministry, Economic Relations Division, investment board, revenue board, FBCCI, Dhaka Chamber, World Bank, IMF, ADB, DfID and other organisations. The governor and other officials took part in a workshop in Tangail on Nov 13-14 to sketch out a draft of the five-year plan. bd
