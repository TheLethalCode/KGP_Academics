 Dhaka, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has called on party leaders to be watchful against sabotage, attack or fear mongering ahead of the historic final verdict in the Bangabandhu assassination case. The central working committee of the ruling Awami League met on Saturday "to analyse the country's political situation" four days ahead of the verdict date. The Supreme Court set Nov 19 for the verdict as the appeals proceedings came to a close last week, more than three decades after the Aug 15 1975 killings. "The Awami League president asked us all to be alert so that no extreme communal forces can create any panic or anarchy," AL joint general secretary Mahabubul Alam Hanif told reporters. Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner AKM Shahidul Haque also instructed his 25,000 force to be extra watchful on Saturday ahead of the upcoming verdict. He told a briefing after the force's monthly meeting, "Everyone, including the traffic police, is instructed to keep eyes and ears wide open." "We are not really expecting any major trouble. However, we have to be careful." RAB and intelligence agencies are already working closely to ensure tight security, said the commissioner. Hanif said the AL CWC meeting asked everyone to face "all conspiracies with bravery" "The cowardly attack upon Fazle Noor Taposh was not any isolated incident," he said. "But the final judicial process is going to be complete after a long wait." The meeting also voiced hope for justice in the Bangabandhu case, he said. "Paths for establishing rule of law and human rights and erasure of the nation's calumny can only be established through that justice." Hanif also said, "We are firmly determined to stamp out graft, which stands in the way of the country's development." "It is possible to rein in future and present corruption only if we can arrange punishment for the corrupt." 'Everyone concerned has been urged to extend their all out cooperation in running the anti-graft drive irrespective of political identities." Having a go at the opposition, he said, "The opposition party has been engaged in a game to make parliament ineffective by boycotting on silly excuses." "They are engaged in haughty attitudes and provocative activities to foil the country's improved stable and democratic course." The meeting thanked prime minister Sheikh Hasina and her government for getting Bangladesh erased from the blacklist of terrorist countries, Hanif said. The agenda also included adoption of an obituary reference, analysis of the country's socio-economic and organisational decisions. In addition, ruling Awami League planned programmes through the victory month of December. The second meeting of the recently constituted central working committee began with presidium member Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury in the chair at the party president's political office in Dhanmondi. The meeting was later adjourned and reconvened at the prime minister's Jamuna residence. The first meeting of the incumbent CWC was held on Oct 3, presided over by party president Sheikh Hasina. bdnews24.com
