 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)--The shipping ministry has decided to revoke lease agreements for unnecessary structures on the river banks and demolish them in an effort to prevent river pollution. A decision has been made to plant trees on the restored land and construct walkways with benches to seat people to stop the banks being reoccupied. Shipping minister Shajahan Khan said separate projects have been launched by both shipping and environment and forest ministries. Khan briefed the media about the decisions after a meeting of Taskforce on rivers at the Secretariat on Sunday. State minister for environment and forest Hasan Mahmud and secretary Abdul Mannan Hawlader attended the meeting. The minister said lease for kitchen markets, landing stations, piers for fuel oil-carrying ships and dockyards will not be cancelled. Except them, all daily and yearly leases will be cancelled, he said. Daily leases will be cancelled from Sunday and for revoking the yearly contracts, the lessees will be notified through letters before the structures are razed down, he said. Walkway and benches for pedestrians covering 135 kilometres will be constructed at Tk 126 crore, to be borne by Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority. The government, Khan added, will demolish the illegal structure after cancelling the lease of 15 decimals of land held by former president Iajuddin Ahmad's nephew along the Buriganga River at Shyampur in Dhaka. Referring to the project to reactivate waterways around the capital in a bid to reduce traffic gridlock on the streets, he said, re-excavation of circular waterways is under way. Water bus or sea-bus will run on the routes to 'largely reduce' traffic snarls. Hasan Mahmud said the government has created a special fund to install effluent treatment plants or ETPs for refining waste and garbage. Loans can be secured from the fund on easy terms. The government has made it mandatory for new industries to install ETP but the new entrepreneurs are defying government order on the plea of huge expenses. Their factories are dumping toxic wastes directly into the rivers and farm lands, endangering biodiversity. bdne
