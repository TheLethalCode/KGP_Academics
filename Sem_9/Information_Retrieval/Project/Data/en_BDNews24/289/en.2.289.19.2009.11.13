 Dhaka, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com)The Detective Branch of Police have got two days to grill three alleged members of Lashkar-e-Taiba captured on Friday on suspicion of plotting to attack the Indian and US embassies in Dhaka. Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Ferdous Ara granted the remand after DB inspector Anisur Rahman in the afternoon appealed for 10 days to quiz them. They were caught from Uttara in capital Dhaka and Tongi of Gazipur, deputy commissioner of DB Manirul Islam told bdnews24.com. Arrestees Sufian Azhari, Zahid Hossain and Manirul Ali all have Pakistani passports. They were arrested on information gleaned from three others suspected LeT members caught last week. Also, the court sent previously arrested Mufti Harun Izhar, Shahidul Islam Sujon and Saiful Islam to jail at the end of their five-day remand. Azhari was arrested at Uttara, while Hossain and Ali were captured at Tongi, Islam added. Police claim Azhari, who had recently completed studies at the Gazipur Islamic Institute of Technology, was overseeing LeT recruitment in Bangladesh. Manirul told bdnews24.com, "These three persons are suspected of having links with a possible attack on the Indian and the US embassies in Bangladesh." A Dhaka court on Nov 6 had granted police two days to grill three LeT suspects including the son of Mufti Izharul Islam, leader of a faction of Islami Oikya Jote. They were captured from Dampara in Chittagong the previous day. Detectives had arrested Emdadullah alias Mahbub, a suspected LeT member at Gabtoli in the capital on Oct 1. The group was founded in 1990 to fight Indian rule in Kashmir. It was blamed for the coordinated attacks on the Indian financial capital, Mumbai, in November last year that killed 166 people. LeT was also blamed for the late 2001 Indian parliament attack and was banned in Pakistan in 2002. bdnews24.com
