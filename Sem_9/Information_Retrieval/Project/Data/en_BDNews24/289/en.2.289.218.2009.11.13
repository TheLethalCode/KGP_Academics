<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com)The World Bank has stressed that a letter sent to the government this week, in response to recent amendments to the Public Procurement Act, requested a temporary hold on "local procurements only" in Bank-financed projects. In a statement issued Thursday, the Bank highlighted four specific provisions in the new PPA to which it objectedlottery system, no qualification/experience requirements, rejection of bids with price above or below 5 percent of estimate, and single stage two-envelope system for procurement of goods and works. "The four specific provisions are not consistent with some fundamental provisions of the World Bank's Procurement Guidelines regarding economy, efficiency, transparency, and fairness," said the statement. The Bank stressed, however, that it had not asked the government to suspend all procurement under WB-financed projects, as was reported by some media outlets this week. It said the letter was sent in order to work "with the government to revise existing project financing agreements between the GoB and the World Bank". These revisions concern "local procurements only", the Bank underlined in its statement. "The revisions in the project financing agreements will only pertain to not using the above PPA amended provisions for Bank financed projects." "Large infrastructure projects requiring International Competitive Bidding will not be affected," it said. "GoB may continue its local procurement under the World Bank financed projects so long as the above mentioned provisions of PPA Amendments are not used," the Bank added.
