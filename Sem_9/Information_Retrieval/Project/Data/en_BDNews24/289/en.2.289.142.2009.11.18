 BEIJING Nov 18, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao told President Barack Obama his nation does not seek a trade surplus with the United States and wants to balance flows, striking a conciliatory note but avoiding public comment on currency rifts. Wen made the comments on Wednesday during a meeting with the US President, according to a report on the Chinese Foreign Ministry website (www.mfa.gov.cn). "China does not pursue a trade surplus," Wen said, adding that his government wants "to encourage a steady balancing of bilateral trade." "Lively global trade and investment will help to overcome the international financial crisis and accelerate global economic recovery," said the Chinese Premier, also urging both countries to "together oppose trade and investment protectionism." Wen's comments are unlikely to persuade industry groups and politicians in the US who argue that China is holding the value of its yuan currency so low against the dollar that it is stoking trade imbalances and standing in the way of rebalancing the world economy. But Wen's reassuring language and praise for Obama in Chinese state media set a guardedly upbeat tone at the end of a four-day visit that exposed rifts over trade and currency policy. "The West's perception of China has been changing gradually, and a positive turn has occurred as Obama has said more than once during his ongoing Asia tour that the United States would not seek to contain China's rise but welcome China as a strong and prosperous player in the community of nations," said a commentary issued by the official Xinhua news agency. Obama's words "forged a good starting point to further Chinese-U.S. ties," it said. NO COMMENT ON YUAN But the absence of any comment on the yuan in Wen's published comments was a telling reminder of the rifts remaining as Obama prepared to head for South Korea. The report said that Obama did raise reform of China's exchange rate policies. At a summit on Tuesday, Obama also made plain to Chinese President Hu Jintao that he wants movement on China's currency policy. Hu, who is also the head of China's ruling Communist Party, also avoided mentioning currencies in comments to reporters. China has had a huge trade surplus with the United States, and is also the largest foreign holder of U.S. government bonds. The U.S. trade deficit with China widened 9.2 percent in September to $22.1 billion, the highest since November 2008, according to U.S. data released last week. After the talks with Wen, Obama visited the Great Wall, for Chinese people a proud symbol of their heritage. For all the bright rhetoric, officials and experts from both sides have stressed Obama's visit will not bring about immediate policy shifts, or end friction over the yuan, U.S. anti-dumping rules, and Washington's criticism of China's controls on citizens' rights and policies in Tibet. Such summits are about setting priorities for future dealings, not making immediate policy changes, said Jin Canrong, an expert on China-U.S. ties at Renmin University in Beijing. The issue of currencies has drawn testy comments from U.S. and Chinese officials. China's Commerce Ministry on Monday rebuffed calls for the yuan to appreciate, signaling resistance to change foreign exchange policy. Outside pressure has been building on Beijing to let the yuan rise after more than a year of it being nearly frozen in place against the weakening dollar, with the latest appeal voiced by the head of the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday. But Chinese officials have swatted down speculation of any big moves soon, and the government appears likely to keep the currency on a tight rein at least until the middle of 2010 to cement the country's economic recovery. "Any policy changes by China, including on the exchange rate, will be based on its assessment of its own interests, not on external pressure," said Jin, the professor. U.S. DOLLAR ASSETS Wen has voiced his own worries about the US economy. In March, he took Washington to task over its fiscal policies, saying he was worried about the health of China's vast US assets, and repeated those worries at a summit in Africa this month. China has amassed $2.27 trillion of foreign exchange reserves, the world's largest stockpile, and analysts think about two-thirds of this is invested in dollar-denominated assets. The Xinhua commentary said the United States, and not only China, needed to absorb some lessons and "figure out effective new ways to tackle its own chronic problems." It also warned that US mid-term congressional elections next year might encourage "more finger-pointing and protectionism" aimed at China. Obama and Hu have said that strains over trade and US criticism of China's human rights restrictions should not overshadow cooperation. Bonnie Glaser, an expert on China at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., said the statement issued by Obama and Hu underscored "the two countries have a lot of common interests, but it remains to be seen whether they can cooperate to advance th
