<TEXT>
 Kishoreganj, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com)  Bhairab was under siege for a second day Saturday as local activists continued their blockade of roads, river and rail routes to press their demand for a separate district. Communications from Bhairab to Kishoreganj were paralysed since the seige began Friday morning, enforced by a local action group calling itself the 'Bhairab District Implementation Committee'. Committee leaders said their siege was also in protest against the burning of an effigy of president Zillur Rahman during an earlier demonstration. Officer in charge of Bhairab Police Station, Shahjahan Kabir, told bdnews24.com, "No reports of violence have been received so far." But the committee of Bhairab residents vowed to continue their programme until their demands were met. A half-day hartal was held on Nov 10 in Bhairab and Kuliarchar. The committee gave a 48-hour ultimatum after the hartal for authorities "to act". Kishoreganj station master Akhtaruzzaman told bdnews24.com Saturday, "As yesterday, rail links are closed between Kishoreganj (Sadar) and Bhairab today too." "The intercity Egarosindu Express that left on Saturday morning heading to Kishoreganj from Dhaka was sent back from Bhairab." He said trains along the Dhaka-Chittagong and Dhaka-Sylhet routes, however, were travelling through the besieged upazila. "But most other trains normally going to various destinations through Bhairab are travelling on alternate routes via Mymensingh today." River communications with Kishoreganj were also halted due to blockades created with vessels including trawlers on the Meghna river. Kishoreganj Bus Owners Association general secretary Murad Reza told bdnews24.com, "Due to the continuing siege on Dhaka-Kishoreganj highway, buses are following alternate routes through Monohordi in Narshingdi and Kapasia in Gazipur today also." He also said that buses heading to and from Kishoreganj in the morning were stopped at Bhairab's Durjay crossing by the committee. The Bhairab District Implementation Committee also held a meeting at the crossing at 11am during the ongoing siege. Committee leaders said the administration had not take any steps against "perpetrators" in the 48-hour ultimatum given after the half-day hartal held on Nov 10. Bhairab upazila chairman Mostak Ahmed Bulbul, upazila AL general secretary Abul Mansur, city AL president Iftekhar Hossain gave speeches among others at the meeting presided over by the BDIC's acting member secretary Siraj Uddin. Various demonstrations are being held in various upazilas of Kishoreganj for and against making Bhairab a separate district. During one such demonstration, a hartal for an undivided Kishoreganj on Nov 2, called by another citizen's group, the president's effigy was burnt. The cabinet recently proposed making Bhairab the 65th district of the country. But the upazilas to be included have not been fixed yet. bdnew2
