<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com)The fire at the National Curriculum and Textbook Board main warehouse gutted papers worth Tk 7 crore, the investigation report has said. Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid, presenting the findings of the probe committee at a press conference on Thursday, said the report found evidence of "arson" and termed the fire "an act of sabotage". But it did not point to any suspect, Nahid said. The devastating four-day fire, which broke out at the NCTB warehouse in Tejgaon last month amid hundreds of tonnes of textbooks and printing paper, consumed almost half the contents of the warehouse. The education minister and other members of the government had termed the fire "sabotage" from the very beginning. The government went on to form a seven member probe committee. The probe report said the arson attack aimed to delay nationwide textbook distribution. "Despite everything, the government is working hard to deliver the textbook to students on time," Nahid said. "Textbook and papers worth nearly Tk 7 crore were lost in the fire." "Apart from that, other losses, including damage of the warehouse, are being tallied," said the minister. He also said that an expert team was working to determine if the warehouse was still usable. bdnews
