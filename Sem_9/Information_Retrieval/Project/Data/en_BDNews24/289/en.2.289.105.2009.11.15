<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov15 (bdnews24.com)The government is moving to create a separate climate change wing under the environment ministry, state minister Hasan Mahmud said Sunday. The state minister for environment also said government allocation for the Climate Change Trust Fund will be directed to adaptation programmes rather than awareness campaigns. The government allocated Tk 700 crore to the Fund in the current budget, he said. Of the total figure, 66 percent will be spent and the rest will be invested for profit, said Mahmud. "There have been a good number of awareness building programmes. We want allocation to be spent now on adaptation," Mahmud told a press briefing Sunday following a first meeting of the CCTF Trustee Board earlier in the week. He said the meeting had finalised what types of projects would receive the allocation. The adaptation projects will include repair of embankments, planting trees on embankments, dredging of canals and rivers and repair of cyclone shelters, said the minister. He said tenders for the projects, to range from Tk 5 crore to Tk 25 crore, would soon be invited by advertisement. He also said the meeting had decided that the new climate department would be headed by an additional secretary. bdn
