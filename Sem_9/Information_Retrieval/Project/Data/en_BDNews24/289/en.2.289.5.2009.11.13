 TOKYO, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President Barack Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama pledged on Friday to revitalize their strained security alliance as they adapt to a rapidly rising China. Washington's relations with Hatoyama's government, which has promised to oversee a diplomatic course less dependent on its long-time ally and forge closer ties with Asia, are frayed by a dispute over a U.S. military base. "I told him that the U.S-Japan alliance is the cornerstone of everything," Hatoyama told reporters after their summit. "But given the changing times and global environment, I would like to deepen the alliance and create a new U.S.-Japan alliance that is constructive and future-oriented." Obama, on his first trip to Asia as leader, agreed. "Our alliance will endure and our efforts will be focused on revitalizing that friendship so that it's even stronger and more successful in meeting the challenges of the 21st century." Tokyo is the first stop in Obama's nine-day Asian tour that takes Obama to Singapore for an Asia-Pacific summit, to China for talks on climate change and trade imbalances, and to South Korea, where North Korea's nuclear ambitions will be in focus. Hatoyama and Obama agreed on a plan to review their alliance over the next year, with a view to deepening it as they celebrate the 50th anniversary of their security treaty. Hatoyama, whose Democratic Party defeated its long-dominant rival in an August election, repeated his view that a row over on the U.S. Marines' Futenma air base on southern Okinawa island should be resolved as soon as possible. The base is a key part of a realignment of the 47,000 U.S. troops in Japan.
