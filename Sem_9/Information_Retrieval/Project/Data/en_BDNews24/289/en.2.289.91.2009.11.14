 Rajshahi, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com)  Police raided Rajshahi University's Madar Baksh Hall in the early hours of Saturday, for the second time in under a week, on allegations that a large cache of arms was amassed there "by Shibir activists". But no arms were found and no arrests made, Motihar police chief Tofazzal Hossain told bdnews24.com. The two-hour drive started from midnight, Hossain said. He also said police briefly detained dining room employee, Akbar Hossain, to question him about the alleged arms. In an earlier raid on Madar Baksh Hall and Sohrawardy Hall, on Wednesday night, police recovered two cocktails and held two activists of Islamic Chhatra Shibir. Ibrahim Hossain Moon, president of the university's rival student body, Bangladesh Chhatra League, said the Shibir activists had "stored up arms in all dormitories". The university's assistant proctor Mushtak Ahmed told bdnews24.com they would ask police to raid every hall if necessary. Chhatra Shibir has been claiming the administration is harassing them in the name of "arms raids". bdnews2
