 TEHRAN Nov 15, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran will soon be able to produce an advanced missile defence system itself if Russia does not deliver it to the Islamic Republic, a senior lawmaker said in comments published on Sunday. The warning by Alaeddin Boroujerdi, who heads parliament's national security and foreign policy committee, was the latest sign of growing irritation in Tehran over what it sees as Moscow's failure so far to fulfil a missile sales agreement. Moscow, which is under Western pressure to distance itself from Iran over its disputed nuclear ambitions, has not followed through on proposals to supply high-grade S-300 air defence missiles to the Islamic state. "Iran is not a country to come to a halt in the face of non-cooperation of other countries," Boroujerdi said, according to Aftab-e Yazd newspaper. "Naturally and in view of the capabilities it possesses, the Islamic Republic will be able to mass-produce this missile system in a not so distant future," he said. He did not elaborate but appeared to refer to a missile system which would have similar capabilities to the S-300. Boroujerdi's comment came two days after a senior Iranian military official complained publicly over Russia's failure to deliver the system, which Washington does not want Iran to have. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton praised Russia last month for failing to provide the arms to Iran, which is at odds with the West over its nuclear and missile programme. Washington has sought specific pledges from Russia for tougher sanctions against Iran over its nuclear energy programme, which the West suspects is intended to produce nuclear weapons. Tehran denies any such intention. The truck-mounted S-300PMU1, known in the West as the SA-20, can shoot down cruise missiles and aircraft. It can fire at targets up to 150 km (90 miles) away and travel at more than two km per second. Israel, which is thought to have the Middle East's only atomic arsenal, has hinted it could attack Iran in an effort to stop its arch-enemy obtaining nuclear weapons. Iran has threatened to retaliate for any attack by firing medium-range missiles at Israel. The commander of Iran's air force, Brigadier General Hassan Shahsafi, separately announced plans to produce new "heat-seeking air-to-air missiles", Jomhuri Eslami newspaper reported on Sunday. Iran often announces progress in its military capabilities and development of new weapons, in order to show its readiness to counter thre
