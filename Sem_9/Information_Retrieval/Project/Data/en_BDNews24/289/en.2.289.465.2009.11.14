Men need to have money in their hands." "The farmers especially the sharecroppers are deprived of many facilities though they play a vital role in economic development of Bangladesh," he observed.

Terming the farmers national heroes, he said, farmers have produced valuable crops in the fields and their sons have sent hard-earned remittance. "As a result, our foreign reserves have exceeded 10 billion dollars." "Marginal farmers and weavers would lose their belongings while paying earnest money in the past." "Now days have changed and the banks will have to approach the farmers and weavers." Rajshahi Krishi Unnayan Bank zonal manager Altaf Hossain presided over the gathering where Krishi Bank managing director Fazlul Haque attended as special guest.
