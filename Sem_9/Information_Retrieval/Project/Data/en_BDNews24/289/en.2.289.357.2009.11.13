 Dhaka, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com)--The government will not submit to any pressure from home and abroad to stop the planned trial of war crimes in the 1971 independence war, the planning minister has said. Many refer to local and foreign powers to resist the trial, said AK Khandaker, also Sector Commanders' Forum that has been campaigning for the trial. "These powers are nothing before people's will." "We made the country independent in 1971 in the face of the entire world's opposition except India." "Those who we fear might stand for war criminals were also our enemies in 1971. So, the government will not yield to these hurdles," he said at a views-exchange meeting with students at the Senate Bhaban at Dhaka University on Friday. Former army chief Harun-Or-Rashid fears that the country may slip into a terrible chaos once the war crimes trial begin. "So, the government has had to move cautiously though it is sincere about trying 'war criminals'." "They are holding many big posts in parties and may try to foil the trial process by using their political powers. This is why the trial process is taking time to begin," he explained. In answering to a query, he said, "Coups took place 19 times in the army against (former president Gen Ziaur Rahman) for rehabilitating war criminals in politics. He cruelly quelled those coups." "He completed the hanging process of 77 army men in one day. Of course, he lost his life in such a coup." On May 30, 1981, a group of army officers shot dead Zia at Chittagong Circuit House. Many incidents get lost forever in the army, he commented. "Families of many army members, who were killed during the tenure of Zia, do not know where their dear ones are." Dhaka University vice chancellor AAMS Arefin Siddique moderated the meeting. bdnews24.
