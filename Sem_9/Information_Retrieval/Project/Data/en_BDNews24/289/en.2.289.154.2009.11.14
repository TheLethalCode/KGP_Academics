 MADRID, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Argentina coach Diego Maradona feels mistreated and persecuted but says he is focussing on his job, family and the support of "ordinary people." Maradona, who will appear before a FIFA disciplinary committee in Zurich Sunday over his foul-mouthed rant after last month's World Cup qualifier in Uruguay, told Spain's Marca newspaper that many people were out to get him. "Much worse things have been said and there are people who do terrible things in soccer...," the paper quoted Maradona as saying in an interview conducted in Madrid Wednesday.

The volatile 1986 World Cup winner had been heavily criticised for defeats to Bolivia, Ecuador, Brazil and Paraguay that took Argentina to the brink of failing to reach the World Cup finals for the first time since 1970. The Argentina Football Federation has sent a report to FIFA, saying: "Maradona was acting in a state of violent emotion over arguments with journalists in the days before the match." Maradona compared his situation with that of Mexico coach Javier Aguirre, who was banned for three matches by regional soccer body CONCACAF in July after clashing with Panama midfielder Ricardo Phillips during a Gold Cup group match. "I say, as a joke, that if I had done that flying kick that Aguirre did against Panama they would sentence me to life imprisonment," he sa
