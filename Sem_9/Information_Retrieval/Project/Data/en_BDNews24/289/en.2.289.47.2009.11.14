 JOHANNESBURG, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Free-scoring Eoin Morgan made England's highest individual Twenty20 score to lead them to a one-run victory over South Africa under the Duckworth/Lewis method after a rain-hit match at the Wanderers on Friday. The Irishman scored 85 not out off just 45 deliveries and shared a fourth-wicket partnership of 98 in nine overs with captain Paul Collingwood (57) as England racked up 202 for six, their highest total in Twenty20 cricket. South Africa had reached 127 for three after 13 overs when the umpires called the players from the field due to heavy thundershowers. According to Duckworth/Lewis calculations, South Africa needed to have scored 129 to win the match. The slightly-built Morgan showed he is a lethal batsman as he smashed five sixes and seven fours, with tremendous power and timing, as well as skilful improvisation. His 85 not out surpassed the 79s scored by Collingwood against West Indies in 2007 and by Kevin Pietersen versus Zimbabwe in 2007/8. England's total also improved on the 200 for six they scored against India in Durban in 2007/8 during the ICC World Twenty20. POOR START England made a poor start on Friday with Charl Langeveldt trapping Joe Denly leg-before with the first ball of the match and fellow opener Alastair Cook being dismissed for 11 by Ryan McLaren, also lbw. But South African-born Jonathan Trott gave the innings some momentum with his 33 off 25 balls before Collingwood, who needed just 27 balls to reach his half-century, and Morgan savaged the bowling. McLaren was the best of the bowlers with three for 33. South Africa made a flying start in their reply, openers Graeme Smith and Loots Bosman hitting eight sixes between them as they raced to 97 without loss in 8.2 overs. Luke Wright provided England with a much-needed breakthrough when he had Smith caught at deep point for 41 off 23 balls. The loss of Bosman, dismissed by off-spinner Graeme Swann for 58 off 31 deliveries, and JP Duminy for six were further blows to South Africa's run-chase as rain began to fall. The hosts needed eight runs off the 13th over to stay ahead of the Duckworth/Lewis equation and Collingwood called back new-ball bowler James Anderson. South Africa's chase then stalled as they could only collect five singles and a wide to lose the match in the dying stages, having been ahead for all but the final
