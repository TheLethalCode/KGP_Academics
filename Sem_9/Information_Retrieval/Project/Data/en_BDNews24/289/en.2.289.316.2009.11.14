 Dhaka, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com)India has "responded positively" to offering Bangladesh rail transit to Nepal, foreign secretary Mohamed Mijarul Quayes has said. The secretary also said the two countries would sign three agreements, including one on prisoner exchange, during Sheikh Hasina's visit to India in December. Briefing journalists after meeting his visiting Indian counterpart Nirupama Rao on Saturday, Quayes said she had expressed her government's "appreciation" for Bangladesh's role in security related issues. Rao also met prime minister Sheikh Hasina, foreign minister Dipu Moni and leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia on Saturday. Quayes said he and Rao vowed to resolve to outstanding border problems "as soon as possible". "During the talks, [Rao] said border killings should stop immediately," said Quayes. Frequent killings of Bangladeshis by the India's Border Security Force is one of the thorny issues between the two countries. There are more than five kilometres of un-demarcated land boundary between Bangladesh and India. Rao came to Dhaka Saturday morning to prepare the ground for prime minister Sheikh Hasina's upcoming visit to India. Quayes told a foreign ministry briefing after talks with her, "The India side has responded positively to giving us rail transit through three bordering points (Birol-Radhikapur, Rahanpur-Singhabad and Chilahati-Haldibari)." He said they also discussed implementation of the Dhaka-Delhi joint agreements reached during foreign minister Dipu Moni's visit to India in September. Rao told journalists after the talks at state guest house Padma, "This is a significant visit. We discussed different issues of the joint agreements." Quayes said Bangladesh, as announced in a recent joint statement, would allow India to carry machinery to its northeastern states to set up a power plant. He said India would sell 250 megawatts of electricity produced at the power plant in Palatana. Replying to a question on whether Bangladesh would give India multi-modal transit facilities via Ashuganj, Quayes said, "There was no mention of declaring Ashuganj as a port of call in the joint statement". He, however, said any development could take place during the highest-level, i.e. upcoming prime minister-level, visit. Sheikh Hasina is scheduled to meet her Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh in Delhi in December. The secretary said the two countries would sign three agreements during the visit. These are an agreement for mutual legal assistance on criminal matters, agreement of transfer of sentenced persons, and an agreement on combating international terrorism, organised crimes and illegal drug trafficking. "We received appreciation from the Indian government on security related issues," the secretary said. India has long blamed Bangladesh for harbouring anti-India groups, in particular banned separatist organisations, though that tone has changed recently as a number of Indian militant operatives are being caught by Bangladesh authorities.
