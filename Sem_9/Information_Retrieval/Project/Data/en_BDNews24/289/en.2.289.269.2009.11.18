 Dhaka, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com)--The Supreme Court will deliver the final verdict on Bangabandhu murder appeals at 11am on Thursday. The five-member bench of the Appellate Division, headed by Justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam, will hand down the verdict at the court room-1, the room of the chief justice. An archway was installed in the room on Wednesday as part of heightened security. Since chief justice MM Ruhul Amin is on leave, Justice Islam will act as acting chief justice on Thursday. Security has been beefed up around the court premises ahead of the verdict of the politically sensitive case. The apex court set the final judgement day on Nov 12 after the 29 days of hearing. On Oct 5, the newly formed bench began hearing the appeals against previous court sentences to hang some convicts in the case for assassinating the nation's founding leader 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Aug 15, 1975. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam told reporters on Wednesday: "The nation is waiting eagerly for the verdict." bdnews
