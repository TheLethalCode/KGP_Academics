<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 15 (bdnews24.com)The US has once again pressed for Bangladesh to recognise Kosovo, which held its first elections on Sunday since declaring independence from Serbia last year Unemployment, corruption, poor infrastructure and low investment are the biggest issues for voters in the break away republic of the former Yugoslavia's Serbia. US ambassador James F Moriarty told reporters in Bangladesh on the eve of the election, "Of course, I have raised the issue of Kosovo's recognition." He raised the issue Sunday in his first call on foreign secretary Mohamed Mijarul Quayes who took office in August. He said he also discussed the issues of climate change, food security and human rights with the secretary. Moriarty, noted for US Balkan policy after the collapse of the Soviet block, has been lobbying for Bangladesh's for recognition of Kosovo, since it declared independence on Feb 17 2008, with backing from the US and European Union. He last met foreign minister Dipu Moni on Aug 22 on the matter. Foreign secretary Mohamed Mijarul Quayes said after that meeting that Bangladesh had no plan to recognise Kosovo "for now". He made no comment after Sunday's meeting with Moriarty. Serbia's ally Russia has already that it would block Kosovo's membership to the United Nations. Bangladesh has good relations with Russia, which was the third country to recognise its independence after the 1971 war against Pakistan. Dhaka, which imports crucial fertiliser from Russia, has also signed a memorandum of understanding with Moscow on implementation of a nuclear power plant in Bangladesh.
