 RAMALLAH, West Bank, Nov 15,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Palestinians are planning to take their quest for independence to the UN Security Council, aiming to secure international recognition for a state, the chief Palestinian negotiator said on Sunday. Saeb Erekat said there was no time frame for the diplomatic initiative. "When we are ready, we will go," he told Reuters. "We have taken an Arab foreign ministers' decision to seek the help of the international community," he said. Palestinians attributed the move to frustration at the lack of progress in peace negotiations with Israel which have been stalled since last December.

"If the Americans cannot get the Israelis to stop settlement activities, they should also not cover them when we decide to go to the Security Council," he said. A senior Israeli minister speaking before Sunday's weekly Israeli cabinet meeting in Jerusalem said such a move would harm peace efforts. "I think any unilateral statement that will be made by the Palestinians will not move the Israeli side forward in order to achieve peace with the Palestinians," Vice Prime Minister Silvan Shalom s
