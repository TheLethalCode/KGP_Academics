"The law-enforcing agencies have been instructed to be watchful so that no unpleasant incident occurs following the verdict," Sahara Khatun told reporters after a meeting on the state of law and order at the Secretariat. Tuesday's meeting asked for improvement of law and order in Dhaka, Manikganj, Narayanganj, Gazipur and all the metropolitan areas of the country, she said. On whether the law enforcers would launch any special drive ahead of the verdict Sahara said: "They will take up any strategy. We cannot divulge everything. "We have to change strategies to work." Special security blanket has already been thrown over the Supreme Court premises, trial court premises and diplomatic areas, Sahara said. The law enforcers have been given directives to be watchful ahead of other occasions such as Eid-ul-Azha on Nov 28, the Victory Day on Dec 16, Christmas on Dec 25 and the New Year's Eve. The home minister lauded the activities of the law enforcers. "They have achieved reputation for their performance over the last 10 months. People have provided us assistance, and we hope they will continue with the same." On the arrest of about 1.5 lakh people without any warrant by the government, she said: "No mass arrest did take place after this government came to office. "If we get any information we will investigate," she said. State minister for home Shamsul Haq Tuku, who also attended the meeting, said: "The information is not correct." Sahara on Monday said the government is not fearing violence but taking additional precautionary measures. Monitoring in the courts and important establishments has been strengthened.
