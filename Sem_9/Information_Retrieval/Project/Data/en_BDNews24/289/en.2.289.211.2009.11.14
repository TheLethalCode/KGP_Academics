<TITLE> UK sets out tough new immigration rules </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Syed Nahas Pasha London, Nov 14 (bdnews24.com)The UK has published a new draft immigration bill to toughen border control. Under the new proposals every prospective immigrant who enters the UK will require 'permission' to stay. If the bill is passed, the five current application categories for migrants will be replaced by one clear concept - 'permission' to be in the UK. According to the UK Home Office, this new approach means aspiring immigrants will either be granted permission or refused, making the rules easier for applicants and staff. Those already in the UK must gain permission or face removal for breaking the law. The proposals, tabled in parliament on Thursday, are the next step in building on the rapid changes the government has made in tightening up Britain's border controls. In his first major speech on migration in two years, prime minister Gordon Brown acknowledged public fears about immigration and its impact on jobs and wages, while maintaining that people who had such concerns were not racist. He promised to tighten up rules on migrant workers, announcing a reduction of thousands in the number of posts available in the UK to non-EU workers. Over the past three years the UK has seen the introduction of e-borders to check individuals in and out of the country and the implementation of the Points Based System, which ensures that only those who benefit the economy can come here to work. In order to bring together the essential changes that have already taken place, the government is proposing the new bill to bring forward a new legal framework to simplify and consolidate 40 years of immigration laws. Ministers say this will make the system more transparent than ever before. British immigration minister Phil Woolas said: "This government has implemented the biggest overhaul of the immigration system for a generation and it is important that UK laws reflect these changes." He believes parliament should be in primary control of immigration and this bill will ensure that parliament and not case law determines policy. The published draft Immigration Bill will enable government to work more efficiently. The new, temporary, time-limited permission will be given for a particular purpose to visit, work or study and is subject to conditions such as access to work or public funds. Permanent residents will be given permission without any time limit or conditions attached. The draft bill also proposes a new streamlined power of expulsion replacing the current powers of deportation and removal. Individuals who are issued with an expulsion order will be required to leave the UK and will not be able to re-enter while the order is in force. A tough new menu of conditions is proposed for those on immigration bail including; restrictions on residence, work or study; access to public funds; reporting and electronic monitoring. The government also published proposals for a new streamlined asylum support system. The suggested shake up includes proposals to: make the principles of the asylum system clear to all who apply, rewarding those who play by the rules and getting tough with those who do not; streamline the current complex system of support to make it easier to understand and easier to operate; and do more to ensure the system works towards the return of those who have been found to have no protection needs and who have no right to be in the United Kingdom. Woolas said: "I believe our proposals strike a fair balance between supporting asylum seekers while their claim is being determined and encouraging the return of those who have no protection needs and who have no right to be in the UK. "We expect those who apply for asylum to abide by the rules. If their claim has been refused, we expect them to leave the country. If they do not, we will enforce their return. To ensure that advice given to individuals seeking to remain in the UK is of a high standard, the government will retain the Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner (OISC) and will consider a range of measures to allow for greater levels of intervention such as the power to deregister businesses, the power of inspection and the ability to serve improvement and probation notices.
