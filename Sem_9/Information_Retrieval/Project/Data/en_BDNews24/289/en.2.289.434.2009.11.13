"What Australia is trying to do is reduce disputes and build on whatever opportunities that exist. Issues like climate change, attacks on Indians and the nuclear deal are a few," said Naresh Chandra, former ambassador to the United States. Representatives from about 190 countries will meet in Copenhagen next month to discuss a new climate change pact.
