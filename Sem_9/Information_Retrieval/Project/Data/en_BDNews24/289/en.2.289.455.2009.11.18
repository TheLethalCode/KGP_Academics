 AHMEDABAD, India, Nov 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lankan centurion Tillakaratne Dilshan attributed his improvement as an international batsman to his decision to convert into an opener. Dilshan struck a quick 112 to help Sri Lanka reach 275 for three in reply to India's 426 at stumps on the second day of the first test on Tuesday. Dilshan got an opportunity to open in one-day internationals in January when he replaced an out of form Upul Tharanga. The explosive batsman was then chosen to open in test match cricket in August during the series against New Zealand and cracked 92 and 123 not out at Galle. "Changing my spot in the batting order has helped me," Dilshan told reporters after recording his fifth test century in 2009. "Now there's an opportunity for me to bat longer and I have got runs and I don't want to throw my wicket away." Dilshan hit 12 fours while scoring his 10th test century and has been consistent at the top of the order in all three forms of the game this year and was named player of the series in the Twenty20 World Cup. Sri Lanka are aiming to record a first test win on Indian soil in this series. "Mahela (Jayawardene) and Thilan (Samaraweera) need to bat out the first session and the ball will start turning towards the end and a lead of around 150 will give us an edge," he said. The unbroken fourth-wicket pair have put on 81. "The main target we have is to bat longer and get closer to 400 and see how it goes from there. We have two good spinners and if we get that lead we can control things." India coach Gary Kirsten praised Dilshan's knock. "Dilshan is a fantastic player, very talented and aggressive. He's a dangerous player, we need to continuously work out how to get him out," he told reporter
