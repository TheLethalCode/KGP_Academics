 Kishoreganj, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com)--Road, rail and river communications between Bhairab and Kishoreganj snapped as a siege began on Friday across Bhairab Upazila. Proposed Bhairab District Implementation Committee enforced the siege to protest against the burning of president Zillur Rahman's effigy and to carve out Bhairab district from Kishoreganj. Speakers at a rally, which followed a procession at Bhairab Sadar Upazila, said the siege began as no step has been taken so far against those involved with burning the effigy. The committee enforcing hartal in Bhairab and Kuliarchar on Nov 10 gave a 48-hour ultimatum to take steps against the perpetrators. The committee vowed to continue their programme until their demands are met. Kishoreganj Bus Owners' Association general secretary Murad Reza told bdnews24.com that buses are going through Monohordi in Narshingdi to Dhaka. Kishoreganj Rail Station master Akhtaruzzaman said intercity Egarosindu Express headed for Kishoreganj from Dhaka has been sent back from Bhairob. Officer in charge at Bhairob Police Station Shahjahan Kabir told bdnews24.com that they had received reports of no untoward incident. bdnews
