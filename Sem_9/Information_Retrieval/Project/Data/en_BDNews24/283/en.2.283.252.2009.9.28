 Dhaka, Sep 28 (bdnews24.com)The Election Commission starts updating the voter lists of all city corporations on Tuesday, a commissioner says. Deputy election commissioner of Dhaka division Biswas Lutfar Rahman told bdnews24.com, "New voters can also be included, while the dead will be excluded." Some 3,500 field workers and supervisors will gather information until Oct 5, while the process of taking photographs will run from Oct 12 to Nov 10. The draft list is supposed to be published by November. The Commission believes a 4-5 percent increase in the number of voters when the list is updated in Dhaka, Chittagong, Sylhet, Rajshahi, Khulna and Barisal divisions. Enlistment in DCC area started on Dec 1, 2007, where over 35 lakh people were registered before the ninth national elections. Earlier, the cancelled voter list had around 40 lakh voters.
