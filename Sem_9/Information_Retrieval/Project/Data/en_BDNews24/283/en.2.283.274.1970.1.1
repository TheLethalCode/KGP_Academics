 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Sep 28 (bdnews24.com)-- Successive governments have been promoting tourism as one of the ways of poverty alleviation for Bangladesh, but the country is yet to exploit the sector's full potentials. But a government report on the Saint Martin's Island, one of the most attractive tourism spots in Bangladesh, says excessive pressure of tourists has been destroying biodiversity on this picturesque island in the Bay of Bengal. An environmental audit, jointly carried out by experts and audit department personnel, recommended that the government should relocate the islanders and regulate and control movement of tourists on the coral Island. The report, which was recently placed in parliament, feared that its residents could die of poisonous water and the Island could turn into a "curse" for the people. Tourism minister G M Quader has admitted that the Saint Martin's Island has been facing environmental problems due to pressure of the tourists. "The island is plagued with many environmental problems caused by the tourism. But my ministry has no authority over the tourist spots in the country. "The environment ministry is in charge of looking after the problems. But practically, the environment ministry cannot resolve the problems," Quader told bdnews24.com on Monday. He said the tourism ministry had been preparing a draft law which would declare all attractive sites as tourists spots and give his ministry total authority for their development. "We will discuss about the proposed law at the National Tourism Council meeting on October 11. "Prime minister Sheikh Hasina will preside over the council meeting," said the minister. "If the council clears the law, we will place the draft law at the cabinet meeting for approval before tabling the same in parliament," said Quader. The report said unplanned and free-style construction of hotels and other infrastructures coupled with unregulated activities of the tourists have made sewerage and waste disposal problems acute and created huge pressure on food and water supplies on the Island. It says the hue and cry of the tourists and the sound of the loudspeakers and generators hamper egg laying and hatching by the turtles which eat jelly fish that destroy small fish and other aquatic organisms. Many species of animals, including the Ring Lizards, have already been extinct and many more are in the process of extinction, the report pointed out. The report was prepared by a 10-member team headed by S M Monjurul Hannan Khan. A K M Jasim Uddin, director general of the audit department, coordinated the environmental audit done between May 3, 2007 and May 24, 2007 and from May 27, 2007 to June 14, 2007. The Saint Martin's Island is located in the Bay of Bengal, 34 kilometres off Teknaf thana of Cox's Bazar district. About 6,000 people live on the 7 kilomtres (North-South) coral Island. The report said about 1,500 people visit and stay on the island everyday during tourism season. "It is a necessity to relocate the permanent residents and the Burmese citizens by framing pragmatic policies to maintain biodiversity and ecological balance of the island," the report said. "People are being settled on the island at an alarming rate resulting in the wholesale exploitation of natural resources and collapse of ecological balance," it said. "If the enthusiastic tourists continue collecting corals in such a pace, Saint Martin's Island will soon loose its status as a coral island," the report warned. It pointed out that most of the hoteliers set up generators along the coastline to produce electricity for the tourists. "Loud sound of generators and lights have been hampering laying eggs by the turtles. Besides, the screaming of the tourists is another cause for hampering the turtles' egg laying," the report said. It said the turtles take refuge on the island to lay eggs in the sand during new moon nights. "According to the environmentalists, the turtles cannot lay eggs if they hear a slight sound and even see cigarette burning. "If it fails to get sound-and-light-free environment in three consecutive days, the turtles either lay eggs in the sea or die of not being able to release their eggs," the report said. As remedial measures, the report suggested that the government should improve communications between Teknaf and the Saint Martin's Island so that the tourists could spend five to six hours on the island by day and pass the night at Teknaf. bd
