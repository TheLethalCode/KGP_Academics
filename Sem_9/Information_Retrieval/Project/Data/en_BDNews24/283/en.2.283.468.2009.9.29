 Rohan Ziad bdnews24.com Business Correspondent Dhaka, Sep 29 (bdnews24.com)Trading at the Over-The-Counter (OTC) market of the premier bourse has yet to take off as the list of companies to be traded has not been finalised more than three weeks into the launch. Dhaka Stock Exchange inaugurated its OTC market on Sep 6 in a bid to facilitate trading of non-performing, under-performing and delisted companies. It has been set up as a separate trading station where interested buyers and sellers can quote the prices and the numbers of shares to be traded. The delay has triggered uncertainty among investors who hold shares of companies that are delisted or whose trading is halted. Market regulator SEC and the bourse have suspended trading in shares of more than 30 low-profile companies since early July. DSE authorities also failed to confirm when the list would be finalised. "It will happen soon," Satipati Moitra, the acting CEO of the bourse, told bdnews24.com on Tuesday. He, however, declined to specify any time period but said they were not facing any pitfalls. Market experts say only finalising delisted companies to be traded would not make the initiative successful, but small companies with good fundamentals should be brought onto the OTC market. "OTC should not be used as a dumping ground for junk shares only, companies who are doing well but fall short of listing requirements should be encouraged to come to the market," said economist Abu Ahmed, an adviser to the Securities and Exchange Commission. DSE, however, kept provisions for such companies to be traded on the OTC market, but initially planned to start with delisted companies. The SEC on Sep 6 asked the DSE to enlist all delisted companies to the OTC market. The OTC market initiative is not new to the country's capital markets, though. In 2004, the Chittagong Stock Exchange established an OTC market, although with little success. Officials at the CSE said the initiative failed due to "non-cooperation from delisted companies". "Back then all CSE delisted companies were asked to enlist in the OTC market, but none came forward," AB Siddique, a former CEO of the bourse at the port city, told bdnews24.com. Market participators fear the current DSE move may meet the same fate. "The whole philosophy is wrong. OTC is not a market for junk shares," said mutual fund operator Yaweer Sayeed. Delisted companies are declared bankrupt by the court and liquidated, before being distributed among shareholders, added the CEO of asset management firm AIMS of Bangladesh. "That's the global practice to deal with such issues."
