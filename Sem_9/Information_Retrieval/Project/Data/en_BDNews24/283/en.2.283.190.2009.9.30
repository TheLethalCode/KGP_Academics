 NEW DELHI Sep 30, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pilots working for ailing state-run carrier Air India on Wednesday called off a strike that saw scores of flights cancelled, bookings suspended and hundreds of passengers stranded over the last four days. About 250 pilots from the loss-making airline began strike action on Sept. 26 after the management announced plans to cut pay incentives as part of a drive to curtail expenditure. Captain V.K.
