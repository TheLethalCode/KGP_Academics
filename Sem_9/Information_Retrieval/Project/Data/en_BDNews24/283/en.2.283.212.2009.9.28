<TEXT>
 Shehabuddin Kisslu reports from New York New York, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has once again urged the opposition to return to the parliament. "I too was in the opposition camp once. No one should forget about the 1/11 and Minus Two phenomena. All should work together to uphold democratic practices in the country," she said, referring to opposition chief Khaleda Zia. Bangladesh will certainly prosper and go ahead if its democratic march is kept unbroken, she said at a public reception on Sunday evening (6am Monday BdST) at Grand Hyatt Hotel in New York. On the return of the opposition to parliament, she said, "It's because of an internal disagreement within the opposition that they are making it an issue." "I don't think it's right to blame others if they can't decide a simple matter like who'll sit beside the opposition chief in parliament. They have rolled the ball too far for no good reason." In a lighter vein, Hasina said, "I had asked the opposition leader to sit beside our honourable speaker to enable them to discuss important matters informally. "Later when I asked the speaker why BNP was not returning to parliament, he said, he had served her murhi (puffed rice) and halim, an appeasing treat, himself." The prime minister said, according to another parliamentarian, maybe because the speaker had failed to add lemon drops to the delectable Iftar dish that evening at the Senakunja. bd
