 Dhaka, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com)--The family of Mafruda Haque Sutapa, a Dhaka University student, on Monday rejected the autopsy report that she committed suicide at her husband's home in the capital. Her family members also claimed it was a murder, and they would consider a second autopsy. Sutapa, who was studying mass communication and journalism, died on Sept 19 in Mirpur. Her in-laws claimed she had hanged herself from the window grille. Her family pointed at her husband Imrul Sadat Abir, who allegedly used to physically torture her over conjugal feuds. On Sept 19, her family filed a case with Mirpur Police Station, saying husband Abir had beaten her to death. Police arrested and questioned Abir. On Monday, Sutapa's family said they suspected that such a report with claims that she committed suicide was done by bribing the people involved. "We cannot accept the report. The killing was stated in Surathaal (inquest) report. But, the autopsy report says it is suicide," said Hafiz Akbar, Sutapa's sister's husband. He alleged that the report was done this way because people engaged with it have taken monetary or other advantages from Abir's family. He said they found police behaviour suspicious as Sutapa's father-in-law and mother-in-law were yet to be arrested. "We have already met with the home minister and sought a fair play from her. She has assured us. We are also planning to apply for the second autopsy." Shah Alam, investigating officer of the case, meanwhile, told bdnews24.com that the autopsy report stated that Sutapa died by hanging herself. Alam said her body bore several injury marks but those "did not cause her death", he claimed. He said Dr Jubayer Rahman of forensic department at Dhaka Medical College Hospital prepared the autopsy report. bdnew
