 TOKYO, Sept 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former world number one Maria Sharapova continued her salvage operation at the Pan Pacific Open by screeching into the quarter-finals on Wednesday. Wearing a pink dress, the Russian beat compatriot Alisa Kleybanova 2-6, 6-2, 6-2 -- to the relief of Tokyo organisers after a flood of early upsets at the $2 million event.
