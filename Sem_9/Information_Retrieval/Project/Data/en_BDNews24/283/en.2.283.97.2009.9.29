<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 29 (bdnews24.com)The food minister on Tuesday sought to allay public fears over rising rice prices saying the farmers were gaining from the hike. "Stocks have been sufficient despite the price hike in the market. Twelve lakh tons of rice and 1.5 lakh tons of wheat are in the warehouse," Abdur Razzaque said. "And we've started the process to procure another seven lakh tons of wheat." The minister said the price of rice in the urban markets has increased more than it has in the rural markets. The price of coarse rice rose by Tk 1 and fine variety by Tk 2 in the rural market, he added. The increased price is benefiting the farmers, he said at the Secretariat after holding a meeting with acting high commissioner of UNHCR in Bangladesh, Saber Azam. He admitted, though, the businessmen and rice millers will gain more from the price hike. Considering the regular food crisis the country faces this season, the minister said his government will act accordingly to meet the crisis through Vulnerable Group Feeding, Test Relief, Food-for-Work and Open-Market Sales programmes so that poor people are not affected. He said the government is set to undertake the employment scheme for hardcore poor within days, from which around 20 lakh families will benefit. On the meeting with the UNHCR chief, Razzaque said there are 24,135 registered refugees in two refugee camps at Ukhiya and Teknaf upazilas in Cox's Bazaar district. Azam urged the government to register the huge number of unregistered refugees living in those camps and pledged financial assistance worth Tk 15 million for the development of educational institutions in the two upazilas. bdnews
