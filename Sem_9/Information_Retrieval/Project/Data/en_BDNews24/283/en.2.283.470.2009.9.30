 Dhaka, Sep 30 (bdnews24.com)- Another giraffe died at Dhaka Zoo on Wednesday. Twenty-one inmates died at the zoo in the last one year including tiger Garjan on Sep 12 and lion Ringo on Sep 10. The three-year old calf died at around 10:30am, after another giraffe died on Sep 7. "The giraffe was in good shape. It did not have any physical ailments. But it died all of a sudden," said Bibekananda Chowdhury, acting curator of the zoo, to reporters in the afternoon. Five giraffes were brought at the zoo from South Africa in June 2008. On average, a giraffe lives from 12 to 15 years, he said. The curator and the deputy curator of the zoo were temporarily suspended after the death of the giraffe. bdne
