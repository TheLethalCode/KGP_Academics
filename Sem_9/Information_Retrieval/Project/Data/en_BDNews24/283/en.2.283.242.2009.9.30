 GAZA Sep 30, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israel will free 20 Palestinian women in exchange for information from Hamas on the condition of an Israeli soldier held in the Gaza Strip, an Egyptian security source, Hamas and the Israeli government said on Wednesday. Egyptian and German mediators would continue to work on a deal to exchange the soldier, Gilad Shalit, for the hundreds of Hamas prisoners the Islamist movement has been demanding, the Egyptian source told Reuters when breaking the news. In the meantime, Israel would receive proof Shalit was alive and details about his condition. A source close to the negotiations said he expected the women prisoners and the information on Shalit to be exchanged on Friday. Israel said it would publish a list of the women to be freed, to allow objections to their release by its citizens.

"This is a success for the Egyptian and German mediators," Abu Ubeida said. He said four of the women to be released were members of Hamas, while 5 were members of the rival Fatah movement. A further 3 were members of Islamic Jihad and the others were from other Palestinian groups. Shalit, a young conscript who was a corporal at the time, was seized by fighters from Hamas and allied groups during a raid on an Israeli border base in 2006.
