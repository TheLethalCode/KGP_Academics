 Dhaka, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com) BNP chairperson and opposition leader Khaleda Zia arrived in Sirajganj Tuesday noon to hand out relief materials among people affected by Jamuna river erosion there. As her motorcade crossed the Bangabandhu Bridge, thousands of people led by local BNP leaders, warmly greeted her and escorted her to Sirajganj town. This is Khaleda's first visit outside Dhaka within the country since the Bogra by-election. Khaleda's motorcade left her Dhaka cantonment residence at around 10 am. Earlier, local leaders and activists of BNP waiting beside the highway at Uttara, Tongi and Ashulia greeted the opposition leader as she drove by. BNP joint secretary general Selima Rahman is travelling with Khaleda. Maruf Kamal Khan, the press secretary of the opposition leader, told bdnews24.com, "Khaleda went to Sirajganj to stand beside the distressed people who have fallen victims to the erosion of the Jamuna." "She read in the newspapers that the erosion affected people there could not celebrate the recent Eid due to sheer hardship," said Maruf. During her visit, Khaleda is scheduled to visit Bawaipara, Paikpara and Diara, the breached portions of the WDB embankment and other places under the Sadar Upazila. bdnews24
