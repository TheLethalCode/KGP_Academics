<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 29 (bdnews24.com)-Chief election commissioner A T M Shamsul Huda has dismissed sidelined Awami League leader Abdul Jalil's claim of the 'election deal' as remarks of a man utterly frustrated. "The election was free and fair. It was praised by the nation and other countries. The standard of the election would be judged by the people. That judgment cannot be based on the claims of an unsatisfied person," he told reporters at his office. The disgruntled former Awami League general secretary said in an interview with bdnews24.com in Britain last week that the party had come to power through compromise in the Dec 29 elections with then military-backed caretaker government. Huda also mentioned that there had been no reports about any rigging or compromise in the last election. But in case of specific claim or complaint, there would be investigation into it. When asked if Jalil's claim had made the election questionable, the polls chief said "The responsibility of judgement is with the people. Our responsibility was to ensure a free, fair and acceptable election. "The local and international observers have seen it. No question about its transparency arose." The comments of Jalil, who was made a member of the party's powerless advisory council in the national council, drew howls of protests from the party top brass. Jalil was assaulted in Birmingham by the AL's youth front. Party president Sheikh Hasina said on Sunday in New York, "Has he been elected that way? He should resign first before making such allegation." On Monday, Awami League general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam, also LGRD minister, said his sidelined predecessor's claim was nothing but "an evil motive to smear the credibility of Hasina". "There's no reason to think that Bangabandhu's daughter will compromise for power. If she had compromised, she would have become the prime minister much earlier." Jalil, who was elected MP from Naogaon-2 on Awami League ticket in the Dec 29 elections, also said that the party president was unjust by sidelining him along with others into the toothless advisory committee. The was no place for several party stalwarts who were ministers in the previous 1996-2001 cabinet when the AL-led coalitions formed government in January. Jalil, Amir Hossain Amu, Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed and Suranjit Sengupta was put in the advisory committee. Jalil was elected AL general secretary in its 19th council in December 2002. He served as commerce minister during previous Awami League regime. He was arrested on May 28, 2007 and got released on parole on Mar 2, 2008. Then he flew to Singapore for treatment and returned home on Aug 31, 2008. bd
