 New York, Sep 28 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has again urged foreign investors to put their money in Bangladesh, which she said "is the best place to invest". "Bangladesh and only Bangladesh is now the best place for investment," Hasina told a conference tilted 'Business Summit with Pan Asian American Chamber of Commerce' at the Bangladesh Consulate at 4pm on Sunday local time. Hasina said global investment banking and securities firm Goldman Sachs termed Bangladesh as a potential sector for investment. "All the investment pre-conditions are now prevailing in Bangladesh. There is no bar anymore for foreign investment," she said. The conference started with a video presentation on 'Digital Bangladesh' that focused on the roadmap and strategies of the government. The scheduled Internet video conference with the chiefs of Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Ltd and the Board of Investment could not be held due to time constraints, though. Foreign minister Dipu Moni, Hasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy and CEO of UTC Associates Aziz Ahmed spoke at the conference. UTC Associates, a Bangladeshi-owned US firm, will develop the blue-prints and implement necessary broadband infrastructure and e-governance, e-finance, e-health and e-learning activities. The prime minister said, "The Bangladesh government, supported by a cabinet of young and honest ministers, gives the assurance all support and facilities for foreign investment." "The target of this government is to fulfil the dream of a Digital Bangladesh and establish Bangladesh as a middle-income country by 2021, on the 50th anniversary of the country's independence." She said many sectors including power, education, health and IT are open to massive investment. The prime minister last Thursday said her government had set its sights on boosting foreign direct investment into the country to $7 billion by 2015. At an address in front of a small group of investors at Grand Hyatt, she said it has also set aside $350 million for three public-private partnership programmes in an effort to draw foreign money. She urged global investors to invest in Bangladesh and said her government will extend all support to encourage investment. Hasina's son Joy said Bangladesh will be the next 'Asian economic tiger'. He too called for investment in Bangladesh and said, "The government is committed to provide all support including one-stop service for licensing and others." He said, "Bangladesh is committed to inspire the private sector." bdn
