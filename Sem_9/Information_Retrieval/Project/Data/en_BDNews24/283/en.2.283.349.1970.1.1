 COPENHAGEN, Sept 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - American First Lady Michelle Obama arrived on Wednesday, the first of a succession of state dignitaries due in Copenhagen to promote four rival bids for the 2016 Summer Olympics ahead of Friday's IOC vote. The First Lady, who will be joined by her husband President Barack Obama on Friday when they become part of the team presenting Chicago's bid for the Games to the International Olympic Committee, will lobby IOC members over the next 48 hours. Also due in on Wednesday were Brazilian president Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, backing Rio de Janeiro, and King Juan Carlos and Spanish prime minister Jose Luis Zapatero, supporting the Madrid bid.

On the second of three days of intensive lobbying in Copenhagen, the bid cities were turning to sporting heroes to promote their cause. Rio brought in soccer great Pele. "Everybody knows my life. I won a lot of tournaments and scored more than 1,000 goals, won three World Cups but I could not play in Olympic Games," he told reporters. "Sometimes I still think I did not get that gold medal." Chicago had Olympic and world champion athlete Michael Johnson, leading a fun run through the streets of Copenhagen, to back their bid. Japan's 2000 Olympics marathon gold medallist Naoko Takahashi was also making an appearance in support of Tokyo. Slowest out of the blocks was Madrid who have held no media events and stage their first news conference this evening, only 36 hours before the IOC session beg
