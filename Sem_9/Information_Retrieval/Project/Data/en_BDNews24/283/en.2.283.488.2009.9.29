 SRINAGAR, Sep 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Troops in Indian Kashmir shot dead on Monday three members of the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) militant group who planned suicide attacks in the troubled region, police said. New Delhi says the LeT was behind the Mumbai attacks last November, which killed 166 people and hiked tensions between nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan. The rebel group denies involvement. "Lashkar terrorists killed in the armed encounter were members of a Fidayeen (suicide attackers) group and were planning to carry out suicide attacks," Farooq Ahmad, a senior police official, told reporters. A woman was also killed and four soldiers wounded in the fierce clash in the Tral area of south Kashmir. Two of the slain militants were Pakistani nationals, Ahmad added. Kashmir remains at the core of a six-decade-long conflict between India and Pakistan. Both claim the region in full but rule in part. The two countries' foreign ministers met on the sidelines of a United Nations summit in New York over the weekend, but appeared not to achieve a breakthrough in mending battered ties. After relative calm, there has been a sudden rise recently in separatist violence across Kashmir, where officials say tens of thousands have been killed since a revolt against Indian rule broke out in 1989
