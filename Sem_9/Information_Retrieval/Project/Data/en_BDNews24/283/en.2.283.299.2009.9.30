<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 30 (bdnews24.com)--The CID police have appealed for remand to question former BNP deputy minister Abdus Salam Pintu and Maulana Abu Taher in the case regarding the grenade attack on an Awami League rally on Aug 21, 2004. Senior assistant CID superintendent Abdul Kahar Akhand filed the remand application before the Dhaka Second Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judge's court on Sep 27. CID appealed ten days for Pintu and five days for Taher, according to remand application. The court sent the remand application to Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court. Magistrate Shahadat Hossain set Thursday for next hearing and ordered authorities to produce Pintu and Taher before the court same day. On Aug 16, judge Masder Hossain ordered the case proceedings to be transferred to two trial courts as the new investigations would take the trial period over the 135 work days, stipulated by the speedy trial tribunal. The past BNP-led government has been accused of attempting to derail investigations immediately after the grenade attack in 2004. The Criminal Investigation Department pressed charges in the two cases on June 11 last year. The proceedings of the murder and explosives cases were running concurrently until their recent transfers. Some 61 among 412 witnesses have so far testified. They include president Zillur Rahman, prime minister Sheikh Hasina, home minister Sahara Khatun and AL's former general secretary Abdul Jalil. At least 24 people were killed and scores injured in the series of grenade blasts on an anti-terrorism rally near the Awami League's headquarters at Bangabandhu Avenue in capital Dhaka. b
