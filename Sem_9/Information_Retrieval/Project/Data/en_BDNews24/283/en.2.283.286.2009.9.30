 Dhaka, Sep 30 (bdnews24.com)--Violence swept across the capital's Mirpur on Wednesday after demonstrators took to the street following the death of a readymade garment worker in a road accident. Angry workers of Outfit Fashion Ltd blocked the eastern part of busy Rokeya Sarani road from 3pm, causing severe traffic gridlock in the area. Protesters of two other garment factories owned by the same people blockaded the road and started demonstrating. They clashed with shop owners on the road around 6pm, leaving the entire road closed to traffic. The agitating workers of Outfit Fashion, Outright Fashion Ltd and Outware Fashion Ltd were joined by those from nearby garment units. Police said Marufa Aktar, 25, a worker of Outfit Fashions, was injured when a bus hit on her on Tuesday. She died in the hospital on Wednesday. Her colleagues said they had asked for money from the owner in compensation to her family and to transport her body to her home in Moagaon in Tarail, Kishoreganj and for burial. But the owner refused, saying that Marufa was not their worker. 'Nasim', a worker of Outfit Fashion, said they will press on with their protests until the demands were fulfilled. Mirpur zone assistant police commissioner Akbar Ali said, "We are negotiating with the (garment) authorities to settle the matter." Police captured the Shikar Paribahan bus that had hit Marufa, he added. bdnews
