 Dhaka, Sep 29 (bdnews24.com)Detective police sought a court order to give them 10 days to grill Amanullah Aman, a former state minister in the BNP-Jamaat government, whom they arrested at Dhaka airport in an attempt-to-murder case Tuesday. Farhana Ferdous, a metropolitan magistrate, who heard the case, postponed the remand decision until Oct 8 on a technical ground and sent the former student activist to jail. A bdnews24.com legal affairs correspondent said police failed to produce the case papers in time, forcing the judge to delay a decision. The magistrate granted Aman division in jail after a request from his lawyer Sanaullah Miah. Aman, produced before the magistrate at 3:30pm, told the court, "I don't know why I've been arrested or what I've done. "I'm ill and have blocks in my heart, whereas the law enforcers have manhandled me physically during the arrest." He returned from Singapore in a hurry to join the death anniversary of his father and could not even visit his son studying in England, Aman added. Aman had just arrived from Singapore when the detectives detained him and drove him straight to a court in downtown Dhaka. Abdul Mannaf, brother of Gani, filed the case with Mohammadpur Police Station in the capital on May 31. Gani, BNP functionary and a businessman from Aman's parliamentary constituency Keraniganj area, told bdnews24.com, "I sought nomination from BNP for Keraniganj constituency, but failed. Later, Aman pressed me to work for the BNP candidate. I didn't do so and Aman sent terrorists to kill me on May 29." Mominul Islam, an immigration Officer-in-Charge at the airport, told bdnews24.com: "The Detective Branch of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police arrested him after he alighted from a Thai Airways flight at 1:30pm." Aman travelled from Singapore, where he had undergone medical treatment, via Bangkok. Asaduzzaman, additional deputy commissioner of DB police, told bdnews24.com: "Aman was facing an attempt to murder charge." The case details, seen by bdnews24.com senior legal affairs correspondent, say Gani and his friend Abdus Sobhan were in a car at Mohammadpur in the capital on May 29 when gunmen stopped the car near Salimullah Road and opened fire. Gani, it was alleged, took five bullets in his body. The detectives arrested five suspects named Sohel Rana, Alamgir Hossain, Ebadul Islam Badol, G M Morshed Tutul and Ataur Rahman. Asaduzzaman said the five named Aman. BNP activists who went to the airport to greet Aman tried to demonstrate when police arrested him. The activists claimed Aman received injuries during the time he was being arrested, a charge Asaduzzaman rejected. Aman had earlier spent time in jail during the tenure of the army-installed caretaker government. bdnews24.com/l
