 JOHANNESBURG, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand resurrected their Champions Trophy campaign when they beat Sri Lanka by 38 runs in their last Group B match Sunday. After losing their first game against South Africa by five wickets, New Zealand can now qualify for the semi-finals if they beat England in their final group game Tuesday. Half centuries from Jesse Ryder and Martin Guptill helped New Zealand plunder 315 for seven from their 50 overs. In reply, Sri Lanka could muster only 277 all out in 46.4 overs thanks mainly to 77 from Mahela Jayawardene and an undefeated maiden ODI half-century from Nuwan Kulasekara. "It was a crucial win and it kept us alive in the tournament and that's the most important bit," New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori told a news conference. "But the manner of the win is something that will be pleasing to ourselves and also to our fans back home. To do it in such an important game is very satisfying.." After being put into bat by Sri Lanka, the left-handed Ryder gave his team a perfect start as he pummelled 74 runs off 58 deliveries before edging a delivery from Kulasekara through to keeper Kumar Sangakkara. The 25-year-old's third ODI half-century was made all the more remarkable due to the fact that he strained his left abductor muscle just seven balls into his innings. Forced to bat with a runner, Ryder shared a first-wicket partnership with Brendon McCullum (46) that produced 125 runs at a run-a-ball. Ryder's departure signalled the start of a collapse from the Black Caps as they lost four wickets for 15 runs before Guptill and Vettori (48) steadied the innings with a sixth-wicket stand of 69 runs. FAST BOWLER Guptill reached 66 before being bowled by fast bowler Lasith Malinga as New Zealand smashed 61 runs off the last five overs. Forty-year-old left-arm spinner Sanath Jayasuriya was Sri Lanka's most successful bowler with three for 39 off 10 overs. Sri Lanka made a lively start thanks to 41 runs off 31 balls from opening batsman Tillakaratne Dilshan to help them to 66 without loss. However, Sri Lanka then lost three quick wickets to slip to 85 for three and never recovered, only a spirited seventh-wicket stand of 78 runs between Jayawardene and Kulasekara providing any real resistance. Jayawardene was eventually bowled by left-arm spinner Vettori while Kulasekara remained unbeaten on 57 runs off 56 deliveries. Sri Lanka have completed their group fixtures, collecting one win from three matches. "Our fielding, at times, has been appalling and not of international standard," captain Sangakkara said. "The lengths we bowled were not right. We have to go back to basics and start to hit our areas with aggression as opposed to just putting the ball on a s
