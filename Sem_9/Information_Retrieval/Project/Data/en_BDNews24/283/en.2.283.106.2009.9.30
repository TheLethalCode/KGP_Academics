 MILAN, Sep 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Shaggy-haired Stevan Jovetic lit up a largely predictable Champions League night with both goals in Fiorentina's surprise 2-0 win over Liverpool Tuesday. While the unheralded Montenegro striker was bursting onto the scene in Florence, Lionel Messi was reaffirming his position at the very top of the world game with a typically stylish strike in Barcelona's 2-0 home win over Dynamo Kiev. The holders top Group F with four points from two games after Champions League debutants Rubin Kazan were unlucky to only draw 1-1 with 10-man Inter Milan in Russia. Argentine forward Alejandro Dominguez put the hosts ahead in the 11th minute and although Dejan Stankovic pegged them back, Mario Balotelli's second-half dismissal left the stuttering Italian champions clinging on. Arsenal had to wait until the last 12 minutes to seal a 2-0 home win over Olympiakos Piraeus in Group H with forwards Robin van Persie and Andrei Arshavin on the scoresheet while AZ Alkmaar drew 1-1 with Standard Liege in a Benelux battle. Group E leaders Olympique Lyon plundered a 4-0 victory at Hungary's Debrecen after Kim Kallstrom had slammed in from the edge of the area on three minutes to start the rout. Sevilla were also in goals, notching up a 4-1 win at Rangers in Group G after Abdoulay Konko's finish early in the second half had set them on their way. Romania's Unirea Urziceni, making their home debut in the competition like Rubin, Debrecen and Alkmaar, had a Dacian Varga equaliser to thank from their 1-1 draw with VfB Stuttgart in the same group. But it was Jovetic, only playing because Alberto Gilardino was suspended, who really made a name for himself when he slotted in Cristiano Zanetti's pass for the 28th minute opener. The striker then touched in Juan Vargas's cross at the near post on 37 minutes with Liverpool, who improved after the break, completely at sea.
