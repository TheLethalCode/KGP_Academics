 LONDON, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Andrew Flintoff says he is still passionate about playing for England despite rejecting a central contract but would like to experience club cricket in Australia. The 31-year-old, who is on crutches after a second operation on his right knee, retired from Test cricket after the fifth Ashes Test in August and his decision not to sign an England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) deal led to questions over his future in the one-day and Twenty20 sides. "My motives are true, I want to play for England for a long time," Flintoff told reporters on Monday in London where is promoting his new book 'Ashes to Ashes'.

It's something personally I would love. "Sometimes players have the end of their careers creep up on them very quickly and they are left with nothing to do. I want to work and I didn't want any restraints on that...there are reasons (why I didn't sign) but none of them are that I didn't want to play cricket for England." Flintoff, who has a lucrative deal with Indian Premier League (IPL) side Chennai, said he would continue to regain fitness in Dubai, adding that he would offer his coaching services to the United Arab Emirates team while he was there.
