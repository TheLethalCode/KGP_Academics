<TEXT>
 Sirajganj, Sep29 (bdnews24.com)--Opposition chief Khaleda Zia has said the government has moved to seal deals against the interest of the country and warned of launching street demonstration against any such deals. "The government is working against the interest of the country instead of implementing its electoral pledges," alleged Khaleda, chairperson of main opposition party BNP, on Tuesday. "It is plotting to strike different deals including one to allow India to use Chittagong port and offer it corridor in the name of Asian Highway," she said at a public rally in the Hard Point in Sirajganj. She saw erosion of the Jamuna at several points and handed out relief materials among the affected people, in her first trip outside Dhaka within the country since the Bogra by-election. "We will take to the street if any deal is signed against the interest of the country and the countrymen will also not allow any such deal to be ratified." She voiced her support to the claim made by disgruntled Awami League leader Abdul Jalil's claim in a recent interview with bdnews24.com in London that his party had sealed a deal with the military-installed caretaker government to take office. "The government has come to power not through popular verdict but through conspiracy and rigging votes," she claimed. "The caretaker government led by Fakhruddin Ahmed was actullay the shadow of Awami League, which caused a great havoc to the country," the former prime minister said of the 2007-08 military-installed interim administration that had replaced one allegedly chosen by her coalition. Slamming the nine-month old government, she said, "After assuming power, Awami League has been involved in looting,violence and corruption." The opposition chief alleged that administration has become inoperative due to politicisation. Efficient officials have been made OSD and replaced by officials who have strong party ties, Khaleda said. The Awami League's policy of non-communalism is nothing but eyewash as its adherents are grabbing properties of Hindus, she said She said, "We want to make parliament effective but they are reluctant to give us seats in the House." "Awami League wants to reintroduce BAKSAL in a bid to make power permanent but people will not accept it." Khaleda visited Bawaipara, Paikpara and Diara, the breached portions of the WDB embankment, and other places under the Sadar BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, adviser to the chairperson ASM Hannan Shah, joint secretaries general Mirza Abbas and Selima Rahman were among the entourage of Khaleda. She arrived in Sirajganj at noon to hand out relief materials. As her motorcade crossed the Bangabandhu Bridge, thousands of people led by local BNP leaders greeted her and escorted her to Sirajganj town. Khaleda's motorcade left her Dhaka cantonment residence at around 10am. Earlier, local leaders and activists of BNP waiting beside the highway at Uttara, Tongi and Ashulia greeted the opposition leader as she drove by. BNP joint secretary general Selima Rahman is travelling with Khaleda. Maruf Kamal Khan, the press secretary of the opposition leader, told bdnews24.com, "Khaleda went to Sirajganj to stand beside the distressed people who have fallen victims to the erosion of the Jamuna." "She read in the newspapers that the erosion affected people there could not celebrate the recent Eid due to sheer hardship," said Maruf. bdnews2
