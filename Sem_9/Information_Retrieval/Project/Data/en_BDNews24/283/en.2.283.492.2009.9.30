 Dhaka, Sep 30 (bdnews24.com)--The busy Rokaya Sarani reopened to traffic at around 7:30pm, four hours after it was shut as violence swept across the capital's Mirpur on Wednesday. Police fired teargas shells and charge baton to clear the road of angry garment workers who had taken to the street protesting the owners' refusal to pay for compensation and burial expenses following the death of a co-worker in a road accident in the morning. Workers of Outfit Fashion Ltd blocked the eastern part of busy Rokeya Sarani road from 3pm, causing severe traffic gridlock in the area. Protesters of two other garment factories owned by the same people blockaded the road and started demonstrating. They clashed with shop owners on the road around 6pm, leaving the entire road closed to traffic. The agitating workers of Outfit Fashion, Outright Fashion Ltd and Outware Fashion Ltd were joined by those from nearby garment units. Police said Marufa Aktar, 25, a worker of Outfit Fashions, was injured when a bus hit on her on Tuesday. She died in the hospital on Wednesday. Her colleagues said they had asked for money from the owner in compensation to her family and to transport her body to her home in Moagaon in Tarail, Kishoreganj and for burial. But the owner refused, saying that Marufa was not their worker. 'Nasim', a worker of Outfit Fashion, said they will press on with their protests until the demands were fulfilled. Md Mostakur Rahman, one of the directors of Outfit Fashion, said to reporters, "We admitted the injured girl to hospital after the accident. We also gave blood for her." "We decided to give money to transport the dead body and for burial purpose. But, we will decide about compensation later." Marufa's relatives headed towards her village with the body. Abdus Sattar, Marufa's brother-in-law, told bdnews24.com, "Marufa is dead. It would be better if we can bury the dead body quickly." Earlier, the owner refused to pay compensation, saying that Marufa was not their worker. 'Nasim', a worker of Outfit Fashion, said they will press on with their protests until the demands were fulfilled. Mirpur zone assistant police commissioner Akbar Ali said, "We are negotiating with the (garment) authorities to settle the matter." Police captured the Shikar Paribahan bus that had hit Marufa, he added. bdnews
