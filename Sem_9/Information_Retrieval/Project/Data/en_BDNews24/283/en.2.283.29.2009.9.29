<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com)Some 130 members of the armed forces applied to a parliamentary panel seeking reinstatement to their job or promotion. They submitted applications to the chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on defence ministry as "they were either terminated from services unlawfully or deprived of due promotions" by the BNP-led government from 2001-2006. "We have received around 130 applications from the deprived members of the armed forces either on reinstatement in services or on demand of due promotions," M Idris Ali, chairman of the committee, said. "The committee has asked for a paper on progress on reinstating the members of the armed forces from the (defence) ministry," the chairman said to reporters after a meeting at the parliament building on Tuesday. The standing committee earlier recommended reinstatement of those members who were allegedly forcefully sent into retirement or not promoted for political reasons. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina also said the "deprived" members would be reinstated after proper inquiry. The chairman said it was up to the government to reinstate the sacked officers and employees. "Anyone who feel that they have been deprived of their rights can come to us," said Ali, a former defence secretary who was charged in a defence purchase corruption case by the previous BNP-led government.
