<TITLE> BNP after Jalil interview excerpts: Bangla TV </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, Sep 30 (bdnews24.com)London-based ethnic TV station Bangla TV has said the opposition BNP has offered money to get excerpts of not-aired part of an interview by disgruntled Awami League leader Abdul Jalil, which created a political wave in Dhaka and abroad. The TV channel in its news on Tuesday said that the BNP was chasing that part of the interview. It said the main opposition party is promising money and other benefits in exchange for the interview excerpts. Last week, Jalil in a brief interview with the station had said that the party came to power through a compromise with the then military-backed caretaker government. The interview followed by a detailed talk with bdnews24.com with its London-based correspondent. Jalil, an MP, had also told bdnews24.com that he made a mistake by not confronting party chief Sheikh Hasina after he returned to Dhaka following overseas treatment before elections. The BNP seized upon Jalil's statement and said it only proves the party's claim that the Dec 29 elections had been fixed. But on Tuesday in another interview with bdnews24.com, Jalil apologised for making such comments, saying he often loses control since the torture by military intelligence, which still haunts him. bdnew
