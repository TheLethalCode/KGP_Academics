<TITLE> Ashraf trashes Jalil's 'compromise deal' claim </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 28 (bdnews24.com)The Awami League general secretary has said his disgruntled predecessor Abdul Jalil's recent claim that the party had sealed a deal with the military-installed caretaker government to take office was nothing but "an evil motive to smear the credibility of party chief Sheikh Hasina. "Party chief Sheikh Hasina knew very well who had betrayed the party and who had not (during the caretaker regime)," Syed Ashraful Islam, also LGRD minister, at a discussion in the city on Monday. Ashraful brushed aside Jalil's compromise theory. "There's no reason to think that Bangabandhu's daughter can compromise for power." "If she had compromised, she would have become the prime minister much earlier (without election)," he said at the discussion organised by Jatiya Juba League to mark the 62nd birthday of Hasina in Dhaka. Jalil, a ruling AL front-row MP, spoke of the so-called compromise theory last week in an interview with bdnews24.com in Britain. He also alleged that most of the cabinet members had alleged ties with military intelligence DGFI, which, many believe, controlled the political manoeuvrings behind the scenes during the two-year emergency rule. His interview preceded a brief talk with the London-based ethnic TV station and was followed by a attack on him in Birmingham. Jalil, who was elected MP from Naogaon-2 on Awami League ticket in the Dec 29 elections, also said that it was his mistake not to confront Hasina after he returned to the country. He said the party president was unjust by sidelining him into the toothless advisory committee of the party. Senior Awami League leaders said Jalil's comments only go to show his frustration while the opposition BNP has quickly seized upon it to launch tirade against both the ruling Awami League and the caretaker government. The minister said those who are talking of compromise just want to belittle the dignity of Hasina. He said the Awami League has survived crisis throughout its political history, and it's nothing new. "Awami League saw lack of trust in 2007 as it did in 1975," Ashraf said. He said some of the party leaders had to play a firm role to ensure freedom of the party chief from jail during the caretaker rule. Acting Awami League president Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury also criticsed Jalil for his comment. Sajeda said: "Attempts were made to poison Sheikh Hasina to death while she was in prison." "She (Hasina) took nothing but rice, puffed rice and banana after I informed her of the killing plot," she said. Jalil was elected AL general secretary in its 19th council in December 2002. He served as commerce minister during previous Awami League regime. He was arrested on May 28, 2007 and got released on parole on Mar 2, 2008. Then he flew to Singapore for treatment and returned home on Aug 31, 2008. bdnews24
