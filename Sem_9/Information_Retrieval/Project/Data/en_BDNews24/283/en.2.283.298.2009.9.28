 CENTURION, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England beat hosts South Africa by 22 runs to knock the world's number one ranked side and tournament hosts out of the Champions Trophy on Sunday. Owais Shah, Paul Collingwood and Eoin Morgan blazed half-centuries as England piled up 323 for eight, their highest ever total against South Africa.

James Anderson finished with three for 42 as South Africa slid to defeat and England, crushed 6-1 by Australia recently, reached the semi-finals.
