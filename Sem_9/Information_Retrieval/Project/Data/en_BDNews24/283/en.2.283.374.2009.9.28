 BRIGHTON, England, Sep 28,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Opinion polls cast gloom over Britain's ruling Labor Party Monday at its last annual conference before a general election which the opposition center-right Conservatives are forecast to win. Senior Labor figures were describing their party as the underdog in the election due by next June, but telling party members gathered in the southern English city of Brighton not to give in to defeatism. Only one in three Labor members of parliament (MPs) believe they will be the largest party after the election, a poll by Ipsos MORI showed. On average center-right Conservative MPs expected to win a majority of 41 in the 646-seat lower house, while Labor MPs on average forecast a slim Conservative majority of only 7 -- raising the spectre of a hung parliament, a nightmare for markets craving decisive action to cut a record budget deficit.

Justin Lewis, a professor at the Cardiff School of Journalism, said that while presenter Andrew Marr may not have crossed an ethical line, he still strayed into territory most found unsavory. "Whether he takes painkillers or not I think is probably a private matter for Gordon Brown. He should be taken to task for his record as a prime minister, not for whether he takes pills." Finance Minister Alistair Darling picked up on the party's "bash the bankers" line Monday as Labor seeks to portray itself as the party of the many, against a rich elite it says the Conservatives would favor. "We won't allow greed and recklessness to ever again endanger the whole global economy and the lives of millions of people," he said, announcing a crackdown on bonu
