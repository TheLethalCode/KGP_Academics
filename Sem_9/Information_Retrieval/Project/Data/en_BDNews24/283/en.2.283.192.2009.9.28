 Dhaka, Sep 28 (bdnews24.com)A faulty electrical switchboard may have caused the fire on the second floor of the five-storey BNP head office building in Naya Paltan in the early afternoon Monday. No casualties were reported till the filing of this news. BNP office secretary Rizvi Ahmed who was at his desk on the second floor told bdnews24.com, "As soon as I heard about the fire breaking out, I came out and saw a switchboard was ablaze. I came downstairs immediately." "The fire originated unawares on the second floor at 12:45pm. An electrical short-circuit might have sparked it off," he added. Firemen went into action immediately. Fire Brigade director general Brig Gen Abu Nayyim Md Shahidullah said, "We got the power and gas supply lines disconnected first and doused the blaze. No great damages or losses were reported." He confirmed the fire originated from an electrical switchboard. But the party secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, who arrived on the spot immediately after the fire broke out, seized on the opportunity. "We demand that the government investigate the incident and find out its causes. This is absolutely unwarranted." Police and RAB personnel along with the fire fighters arrived soon after they received the news of the blaze and put out the fire in half an hour. BNP activists, estimated to be around 50 in number who were around during the accident, helped the fire fighters. bdnews24.co
