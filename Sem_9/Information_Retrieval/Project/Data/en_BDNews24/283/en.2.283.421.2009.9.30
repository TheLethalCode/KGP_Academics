 Dhaka, Sep 30 (bdnews24.com)--Campaigners will hold a two-day convention in the capital involving mainly day-labourers and housemaids to focus on their plights and possible remedies, organisers said Wednesday. The convention is set to begin on Friday, said Zakir Hossain, member secretary of preparation committee of "National Convention of Non-institutional Workers", said at a news conference at Dhaka Reporters Unity (DRU) office. Hossain labelled it as non-institutional sector and said 40 percent of annual national income comes from it, but it is not considered part of mainstream economy. Working at brick kilns, ferrying cheap items or working as housemaids is hardly recognised in society, Hossain said, adding that such floating workers face tremendous physical and mental pressure at their workplaces. But, he said, they don't have formal appointments, labour laws do not apply there, and even the state does not have any body to deal with their issues. He revealed that some one crore women work in this non-institutional sector. "They work without social security, with poor wages. They suffer from negligence from their husbands and families. They go through various social barriers," he said. Hossain said through the planned convention they want to draw the government's attention to the issues of such workers. Voluntary organisation Partnership of Women in Action and Nagorik Uddyog organised the convention jointly. They will also organise rallies and cultural programmes during the convention. bdnew
