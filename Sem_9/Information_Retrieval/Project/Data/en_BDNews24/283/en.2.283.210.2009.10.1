 Dhaka, Sept 30 (bdnews24.com) Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman has said developed economies should take Bangladesh and Nepal as their partners in fixing impacts of global recession. Atiur is currently attending a four-day conference of Commonwealth Finance Ministers in Cyprus. It will end on Oct 3. He delivered a speech at a meeting of Commonwealth central bank governors during the conference. Talking to bdnews24.com by phone, Atiur said on Wednesday that up to now Bangladesh and Nepal have successfully countered impacts of global economic crisis, and that's why the South Asian nations have their role to play in a bigger context.

"I have stressed the issue so that data about the recession is made available." bd
