<TITLE> Fighting corruption key to future US ties to Karzai </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Sep 30, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Concerned that its war strategy will be undermined by doubts over Afghan President Hamid Karzai's credibility, the Obama administration will put fighting corruption at the core of its future dealings with Kabul, US officials said on Tuesday. Mounting Western casualties, fading American public support for the war and last month's fraud-marred presidential election have exposed rifts within the US administration over what strategy will work best to stem Taliban gains in the eight-year conflict. While President Barack Obama's advisers disagree over whether to send more troops, officials said there was consensus any new strategy must get tough on Karzai over corruption. "When the new Afghan government takes office, it is going to have to improve its performance," said one senior US official. "Our message is that it is time to step up and take more aggressive action that directly addresses the issue of corruption and improves the performance of various ministries." The goal, officials said, was to get Karzai to sign onto a series of anti-corruption measures, including the possible creation of an anti-corruption commission. NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who met Obama on Tuesday, proposed an international conference this year to advance anti-corruption and governance issues, holding them out as prerequisites for international commitment to Afghanistan. Obama planned a series of meetings starting this week with his top advisors over future strategy. In addition to military-backed proposals to send up to 40,000 more troops to Afghanistan as part of counter-insurgency efforts, the White House is also considering a bigger emphasis on targeting militants with aerial drones and special forces in neighboring Pakistan. Some military officials chafe at suggestions U.S. strategy could be changed because of doubts over Karzai's standing. "You deal with the devil when you have to," one said. CAN COUNTERINSURGENCY WORK? At the center of the debate, officials said, is the question of whether a counter-insurgency strategy focused on winning over the Afghan population can still work if Karzai's government is not seen as legitimate by the people. In his confidential assessment of the war, the top U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan, General Stanley McChrystal, said a troop increase alone would not to turn the tide against a resurgent Taliban. He called for other urgent steps, including improved governance by the Afghans. Obama's advisers have been frustrated by what they see as Karzai's refusal to tackle corruption. Tensions flared after the Aug. 20 vote when Obama's envoy to Afghanistan, Richard Holbrooke, urged Karzai to respect the election process and raised the possibility of a run-off. The senior U.S. official said Washington was ready to offer practical assistance to the next Afghan government, such as sending more civilian advisers to ministries to help improve services to wide swathes of the country. The push to combat corruption and improve services reflects Washington's calculation that Karzai, however damaged, is likely to have enough votes to remain president for another term regardless of the outcome of any recounts or runoff. In talks with Afghan Foreign Minister Rangeen Dadfar Spanta on Monday, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stressed the importance of the Afghan government being seen as legitimate by its people, an implicit recognition of deep skepticism toward the government because of pervasive corruption. "She said that it was really important that the government earn the trust of the Afghan people and the importance of letting the process play out on elections," an official said. Rasmussen echoed Washington's private messages, saying he hoped to advance what he called a "new contract" with Kabul. "I think we should address these problems head on and tell the Afghan government ... that it is a prerequisite for a strong international commitment that they ensure good governance, including a strong fight against corruption." Democratic Sen. Ted Kaufman, who saw Karzai on a visit to Afghanistan this month, was skeptical of his commitment. "He (Karzai) has said a lot of the right things, but I am not convinced," the Delaware senator told Reuters. "One of the keys to counter-insurgency is having a government that the local people pick over the insurgents." Alex Thier of the US Institute of Peace suggested Karzai make a major speech at the beginning of his next term promising bold steps to tackle corruption, followed by some high-level indictments to prove his commi
