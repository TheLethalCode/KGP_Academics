 Dhaka, Sep 30 (bdnews24.com)Former shipping adviser M A Matin has given his statement in the corruption case regarding the container management contract at Chittagong port, where he said he was innocent. He appeared before the Anticorruption Commission's temporary camp, set in the board room of Chittagong Port Authority office, at 10am on Wednesday. He left at around 11:10am after submitting a written and verbal statement to three ACC officials. "There is no question of irregularities in the allocation of a container handling contract at Chittagong Container Terminal in January. Lowest bidders were awarded the container management deal after completing the tender acceptance procedure in a transparent way." Asked what the committee wanted to know from him, the former anti-graft taskforce chairman said, "The matter is under investigation. I have said what I wanted to say before the committee. "I don't want to say anymore beyond." "There was no irregularity in tender. Charges of irregularities may arise. But, the main thing is the motive." "I don't think someone did that to wreak personal vengeance," he said when asked whether he believed the charges were pressed with the motive to harass him. He also added that port renovation was initiated during his time in the interest of the country, which added pace to port operations. A three-member committee headed by ACC deputy director Sheikh Fanah Fillah launched investigation on Tuesday into 'massive irregularities' in the container management deal and 'corruption' in raising the service age of "pilots" at Chittagong port. The enquiry committee also took the statement of Harun Miah, port member (finance) who is currently on leave before retirement, on Tuesday morning. Fillah said to reporters, "We called them for statement and it was taken." The probe committee also took statement from nine officials, including Chittagong Port Authority chairman commodore RU Ahmed, on Tuesday. If necessary, the defendants might be summoned in Dhaka, Fillah added. The other members of the probe committee are Jahid Hossain, assistant director at ACC's Dhaka office and Abdul Awal, inspector at Chittagong office. After Matin's statement, Fillah said Matin was brought face-to-face with the CPA chairman. However, Fillah declined to say what Matin said for the sake of investigation. The ACC official said they inspected terminal and seized some documents. "We will take statement from different people until 8pm and it will continue through to next Thursday noon." He said probe committee is taking statement from the CCT tender evaluation committee and Chittagong Port Authority members. They heard nine person's statement on Tuesday and have a target for 20. The parliamentary standing committee on shipping ministry accused Matin for irregularities in appointing director in Chittagong Container Terminal. Later, the committee approved the probe report submitted by the sub-committee on the corruption charges against the ex-adviser. The standing committee unanimously accepted the report of the parliamentary sub-committee that found "massive irregularities" done by Matin and eight others on the last day of his office on Jan 6. The ACC started investigation after getting necessary documents from shipping ministry. The tender was not invited properly in line with the government rules which caused financial losses to the public exchequer and the CPA did not hold any board meeting before awarding the contract, it was alleged. According to the CPA, Saif Power Tech was appointed in June, 2006 to handle CCT. In the end of that contract in 2008, tender was floated to appoint new contractor in November. Tender was called again in December after canceling the first. Ishaq Brothers had quoted the lowest price, Tk 340 per container handling. The ministry approved the working order after accepting lowest bidder. The CPA authority signed agreement with Ishaq Brothers on Feb 2, 2009. Also, false certificate was given in favour of Ishaq Brothers, a "novice" company. Matin was also home adviser and chief of the corruption-busting national committee formed by the past military-installed caretaker government. The standing committee found that Matin had allegedly arranged a board meeting of the CPA in the afternoon of Jan 5 to evaluate the tender committee's report. The CPA initiated the file to award the contract within 24 hours to Ishaq Brothers after the meeting and couriered it to Dhaka by air, the committee said. The file was accepted on Jan 6 morning and the same was sent to CPA for necessary actions after the adviser had signed it. The file reached Chittagong in the afternoon of Jan 6 and the CPA awarded the work to Ishaq Brothers at 9pm when the new government was taking oath at the Bangabhaban. The standing committee also alleged that Matin had raised the service age of "pilots" at Chittagong port to 60 years from 57. Matin was the first adviser to the 2007-2008 caretaker government to face corruption charges. bdnews24
