 JOHANNESBURG, Sept 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England captain Andrew Strauss praised New Zealand counterpart Daniel Vettori for recalling Paul Collingwood after he had been given run out during their Champions Trophy clash on Tuesday. Collingwood, on 14, wandered out of his crease after he evaded a short-pitched delivery from Kyle Mills, under the impression the end of the over had been called, and wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum threw down the stumps. The batsman was given out by TV umpire Aleem Dar but, after conferring with on-field umpires Daryl Harper and Asad Rauf and his team-mates, Vettori called Collingwood back. "Paul obviously wasn't taking a run although he was probably a bit hasty to leave his crease. He did say that if he had been given out, he would only have had himself to blame for being a bit dozy," Strauss told reporters. "But New Zealand were within their rights and I would just like to applaud Dan for the way he handled it. It must have been a tough decision to make when your future in the tournament is on the line." New Zealand reached the semi-finals after a four-wicket win over England, who had already qualified. "Looking after the spirit of the game was the main reason for the decision," Vettori said. "I had a little bit of time to think about it and, after deliberating with my team and the umpires, it was an easy decision in the end. There was never any intention of taking a run." Strauss was praised earlier in the tournament when he recalled Sri Lankan batsman Angelo Mathews after he was run out after colliding with England bowler Graham Onions. England will travel to Centurion to play their semi-final against the team that finishes top of Group A, either Pakistan or Australia, on Friday. New Zealand will play their semi-final in Johannesburg on Saturda
