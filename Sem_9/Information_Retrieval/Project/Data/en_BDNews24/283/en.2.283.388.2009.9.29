 MOSCOW, Sep 29, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran's recent missile tests do not boost the case for imposing sanctions on Tehran over its nuclear programme, Interfax news agency quoted a senior Russian diplomat as saying on Tuesday. Iran has test-fired a new round of missiles ahead of a meeting in Geneva on Thursday between Iran and a six-member group including five permanent members of the UN Security Council and Germany on Tehran's nuclear programme. "I think ... there is no question of using this fact to escalate debates on imposing sanctions," Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev last week backed Western pressure on Iran to give up military elements of its nuclear programme by warning Tehran that "other means" could be used if the Geneva talks failed. The test launches followed Iran's announcement last week it was building a second uranium enrichment plant, a move which raised fresh concerns about the goal of Tehran's nuclear programme. But Ryabkov admitted that the test launches could be used by proponents of sanctions at the Geneva talks to bolster their positions. "In the atmosphere of acute political debates around the Iranian nuclear programme, the test launches indeed add arguments for those who seek to start discussing additional sanctions," he said. Russia, a veto-wielding permanent member of the UN Security council, has backed three sets of mild sanctions against Iran in the UN Security Council. But it has so far blocked any strong measures against its ally. Medvedev's remarks made after meeting with US President Barack Obama were broadly interpreted by analysts as a sign of toughening of Russia's approach to Tehran. However, on Monday Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov urged restraint in reaction to the Iranian missile launches, although he said that they worried Russia. Ryabkov welcomed Iran's proposals handed over to the six-member group earlier this month and treated sceptically by the Western powers. "The Iranian proposals are broad enough," Ryabkov said. "They enhance a number of issues related to international security and more. There is a broad field for dialog
