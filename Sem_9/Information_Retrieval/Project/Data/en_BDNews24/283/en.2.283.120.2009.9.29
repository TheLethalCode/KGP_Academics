<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 29 (bdnews24.com)The authorities of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University sacked 10 professors and one associate professor on Monday in an apparent purge of political appointees during the BNP-Jamaat coalition government. University registrar Abdul Gafur told bdnews24.com that the 11 had been "relieved" of their jobs because their appointments "flouted rules and were unlawful". The termination order was issued on Tuesday and will come into effect from 2pm on Wednesday, Gafur said. "They had already retired from their regular government service and joined the university. The problem was they were re-appointed on terms applicable for regular appointments. They could only be appointed on contract," Gafur explained. A decision to cancel these appointments was taken at a meeting of the policymaking Syndicate just before the Eid holidays, Gafur said. The professors terminated are Jahangir Kabir, Nasim Ahmed Chowdhury, Sayeba Aktar, Nur Jahan Begum, Motiur Rahman Mollah, Nargis Aktar, S A Khan, Abul Kashem Chowdhury, Nazrul Islam and Mijanur Rahman. The only sacked associate profession is Sharif Hasan. All of them got appointed to BSMMU on retirement from their government service during BNP-Jamaat alliance government. He said as per Government Employee Retirement Act 1974, an employee cannot join a regular government service after retirement but can work on contract. Gafur said the terminated physicians can serve on contract if they want. "Some of them have already told me that they are eager to work on contract," Gafur said. The Doctors Association of Bangladesh (DAB), a pro-BNP forum, condemned the termination order. A press release signed by acting secretary of DAB, SM Rafiqul Islam, demanded withdrawal of the order. bdnews
