 Dhaka, Sep29 (bdnews24.com)The government will consider the condition of the marginal poor when it considers hiking electricity and gas prices, the prime minister's adviser Toufiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury has said. "We will get a reasonable price of energy if we develop the mentality to cut in expenditure," he said at a roundtable titled 'Policy, Pricing & Subsidy for Sustainable Energy' at CIRDAP auditorium on Tuesday. Chowdhury, a former secretary who advises the prime minister on power, energy and mineral resources, agreed to the recommendations made by experts and consumers on the rise in electricity and gas prices. "We can move forward like developed countries through proper management," he said State minister for energy, power and mineral resources Enamul Haque said there is no alternative to developing energy sector and for that, price rise is a must. "The implementation of the methodology will have to be finalised after making experts and common people aware of its value assessment and subsidy potentiality," Haque said. Former state minister for energy AKM Mosharraf Hossain also argued in favour of a price rise. Former FBCCI president Abdul Awal Mintoo said the price of gas and electricity must go up to ensure economic growth. "One percent economic growth calls for 2.5 percent rise in power supply." He also said: "It will require 18-20 percent rise in supply of electricity and gas to ensure eight percent growth after two years." Acting chairman of Energy Regulatory Commission, Mokhlesur Rahman, said they would sit on Oct 5 to make a decision. In his keynote paper, Ejaj Hossain of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology recommended 10-12 percent rise in gas and electricity price annually. The roundtable was hosted by energy affairs magazine, Energy & Power. Moderated by Mollah Amjad Hossain, the discussion was attended by former Planning Commission chief Rafidul Islam Khan, Shamsul Islam, SM Mansur, ST Masud and Rizwan Khan. bd
