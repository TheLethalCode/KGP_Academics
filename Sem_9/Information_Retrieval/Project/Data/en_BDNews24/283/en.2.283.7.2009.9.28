 Dhaka, Sep 28 (bdnews24.com)A committee has been formed to investigate the mysterious explosion that triggered a blaze spreading across the second floor of BCIC Sadan in Motijheel on Monday morning. The committee, headed by a deputy director of the Fire Brigade, has been asked to submit a report as soon as possible, Fire Brigade director general Brig Gen Abu Nayyim Mohammed Shahidullah told bdnews24.com. The blast left one dead and seven people injured so far, police said. The dead was named as Noor-e-Maleque Md Mojibur Rahman, the DMCH correspondent said. Shahidullah said their primary investigation suggested it was not a bomb blast, but a gas explosion. He said the incident was similar to the blast at Hotel Orchard on Jun 2 last year when the channels of gas and toilet were mixed up and caused gathering of gas. The explosion had taken place when a foreigner lit a cigarette. Most of the offices were closed for the Eid and Durga Puja vacations, which might have created the gas gathering, he added. The dead was a smoker and was staying at the rest house of the BCIC on the fourth floor. Perhaps, the explosion occurred when he was lighting a cigarette while walking down the stairs, Shahidullah added. Fire-fighters rescued four more people from the fourth floor of the building in the second spell of rescue operation, of whom one died. The total number of injured is seven, police said. At around 11:40am, the four unconscious people who had been asleep there were evacuated. They fell ill as the fire smoke billowed and crept onto the fourth floor. The unconscious persons were soon sent to hospital, where one died. No-one could be identified then and there. Dr Samanta Lal, physician on duty at the burns unit of Dhaka Medical College Hospital, said Noor-e-Maleque Md Mojibur Rahman had expired at around 11:15am in unconscious state. Mojibur, born in Kishoreganj, was an employee of Ghorhasal Fertiliser Factory and the general secretary of Sramik League unit there. The injured Motaleb Chowdhury, 40, Md Shaheen, 30, Shiblu Saha, 28, 'Ujjal', 36, 'Rubel', 18, SM Anwar Hossain, 32, Abdul Khaleque , 25, Shahabuddin, 50, and 'Sarwar', 48, were sent to the DMCH. Earlier in the morning, the firefighters doused the blaze at around 10:45am. Immediately after the explosion, RAB, police and fire service personnel arrived at the spot. bdnews24.co
