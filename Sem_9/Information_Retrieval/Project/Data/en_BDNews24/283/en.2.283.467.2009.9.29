 LONDON, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester City got back to winning ways in the Premier League after their derby setback when two goals by Carlos Tevez inspired a 3-1 home victory over the Argentine's former club West Ham United on Monday. Tevez, whose goals helped West Ham avoid relegation in 2007 before he moved to Manchester United, scored after five and 61 minutes as City completed a deserved win.

They went ahead after five minutes when Martin Petrov squared for former Hammers hero Tevez to fire in from close range. Tevez had two more good early chances before West Ham grabbed an unexpected equaliser after 24 minutes when a Radoslav Kovac shot was deflected in by striker Carlton Cole, only for Petrov to restore the lead eight minutes later with a well-struck free kick.
