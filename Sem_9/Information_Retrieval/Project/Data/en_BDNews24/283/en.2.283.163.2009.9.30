 Shehabuddin Kisslu, from New York New York, Sep 30 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina is on her way to Dhaka concluding her trip to USA. She started at 11pm local time on Tuesday from Washington. Hasina told reporters at the airport prior to her departure that her tour to the United States had been successful. Sajjadur Rahman, acting general secretary of USA branch of Awami League, said, "The prime minister said that her tour was successful. "But she expressed her regret for not being able to meet with party leaders and workers separately for security reasons." Hasina had gone to the US on Sep 21 to attend the 64th session of the United Nations General Assembly. On Sep 26, she delivered her speech in Bangla at the assembly where she called for proportional representation of Bangladesh in the plans and strategies of UN peace missions and sought the support of member countries to make Bangla an official language of the world body. She urged the world leaders to be united to face the challenges of climate change, economic downturn and international terrorism. During her visit, Hasina had a meeting with US president Barak Obama and invited him to visit Bangladesh. Speaking at a number of discussion meetings in New York, she urged the non-resident Bangladeshis and foreigners to invest in Bangladesh. The prime minister also travelled to Washington and celebrated her 63rd birthday at the Marriott Hotel in Baltimore by cutting a cake surrounded by her family members. Her sister Sheikh Rehana, son Sajib Wajed Joy and daughter Saima Wajed Hossain Putul were present on the occasion. Hasina also consulted a doctor in Washington for treatment of her partly damaged hearing ability as a result of a deadly grenade attack in 2004. Her doctors said that her eyes and ears are now in a better condition than before and regular treatment will improve her hearing ability, said Khalid Hasan, AL president in USA. It was Hasina's first trip to USA after assuming the office of prime minister for the second time. Foreign minister Dipu Moni, environment minister Hasan Mahmud, cabinet secretary M Abdul Aziz, foreign secretary Mizarul Kayes, former high commissioner Mohammad Ziauddin, MP Nasrul Hamid Bipu, columnist Mustafa Noor-ul-Islam, prime minister's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad and her sister Sheikh Rehana are in the entourage of the prime minister. bdnew
