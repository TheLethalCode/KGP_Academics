 Dhaka, Sept 30 (bdnews24.com)  The former Sussex captain, John Barclay, has been named as the new president of MCC, and will take over from his predecessor, Derek Underwood, on a one-year tenure from Oct 1. Barclay, 55, was an acclaimed schoolboy cricketer and made his debut for Sussex at the age of just 16. He went on to play for the county for 16 years, assuming the captaincy in 1981, and went onto lead England Young Cricketers in the Caribbean in 1972, aged 18. After retiring in 1986, Barclay managed England, England A and England Under-19 tours, before taking over as director of cricket and coaching for the Arundel Castle Cricket Federation, as well as serving as president of the English Schools Cricket Association, the chairman of the Sussex Cricket Board and Chair of Sussex CCC's cricket committee. In addition, Oliver Stocken, the former club treasurer, will succeed Charles Fry as MCC's club chairman for a three-year tenure. "It is a great honour to become chairman of MCC," said Stocken. "The sport is changing at a rapid pace, and cricket administrators the world over have a duty to prioritise the health of the game at all times. "MCC's committee must play its part in the years ahead, to ensure the maintenance of Lord's as the best cricket ground in the world and the position of MCC as the leading independent voice in the game. It is a challenge I am looking to forward to." Joining the MCC Committee for a three-year period will be Christopher Martin-Jenkins (for his first term), Matthew Fleming (for his second term), Sir John Major (for his third term) and Fry, who has served on the committee in a variety of positions from 1983. All were elected by MCC's 18,000 membership. Stepping down from the committee are Mike Gatting, Tim O'Gorman and David Walsh. Completing the day of change at MCC, Robert Griffiths QC will become chairman of the newly-created Development committee, which is tasked with making recommendations to the MCC Committee regarding the Vision for Lord's and to assist with the implementation of new development proposals at the Home of Cricket. Members of the Development committee include Sir John Major, Tony Lewis (who is chairman of MCC's World Cricket Committee), Michael Atherton (who also sits on the MCC World Cricket Committee) and Jamie Ritblat, chairman and chief executive of property developers Dela
