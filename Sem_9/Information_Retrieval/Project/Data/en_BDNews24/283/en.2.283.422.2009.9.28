 TOKYO, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World number one Dinara Safina cut a dejected figure after suffering a 7-6, 4-6, 7-5 shock defeat by Taiwanese qualifier Chang Kai-chen in her opening match at the Pan Pacific Open on Monday. The Russian, dumped out of the US Open in the third round earlier this month, struggled from the start against a player 131 places below her in the world rankings.

While Safina yelled at herself in Russian, the 18-year-old Chang kept her cool, completing the biggest win of her career by forcing Safina into wild forehand on her third match point. "I never came into the match thinking I was going to lose badly," said Chang after winning a marathon match in two hours and 44 minutes. "I just wanted to play tough. "I was jumping up and down at the end thinking about my mum. She never watches me play but she watches the live scores (on the Internet) so I was wondering what she was thinking." Earlier, Ai Sugiyama's final WTA Tour appearance ended prematurely when the Japanese player retired from her first-round match with Russian Nadia Petrova while trailing 6-0,
