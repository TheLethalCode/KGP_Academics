 TOKYO, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian Elena Dementieva became the latest high-profile casualty at the Pan Pacific Open when the third seed was upset by Ukraine's Kateryna Bondarenko in the second round on Tuesday. Former world number one Maria Sharapova had no problems, however, powering into the last 16 in Tokyo with a faultless 6-0, 6-1 victory over Australia's Samantha Stosur. Dementieva, the reigning Olympic champion, was bundled out 6-2, 6-7, 6-1 to leave the lucrative $2 million Tokyo event shorn of its top three seeds. World number one Dinara Safina, second seed Venus Williams and French Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova were all tripped up in their opening matches on Monday after first-round byes. A tournament which began with nine of the world's top 10 was down to just three before the close of play on Tuesday. Dementieva blamed some questionable line calls and fatigue for her loss to a player she had not conceded a set to in four previous meetings. BAD CALLS "There were way too many bad calls from the chair umpire today," she grumbled to reporters. "I'm surprised they don't have a challenge system at such a big event." Dementieva, a second-round loser at the US Open earlier this month after a strong run on north American hardcourts in the run-up to the year's final Grand Slam added: "I played way too many matches in the US Open series. "I would have liked to have an extra week to get refreshed for this event. I just didn't have the energy." Sharapova, 25th in the world rankings following shoulder surgery a year ago, answered the prayers of tournament organisers by overpowering 12th seed Stosur in just 57 minutes. Stosur at least avoided the dreaded "double bagel" by saving two match points at 0-5 in the second set but the Russian wrapped up a clinical victory with an ace two minutes later. Sharapova next faces countrywoman Alisa Kleybanova, who knocked out sixth seed Vera Zvonareva 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 in another Russian clash. Bondarenko, meanwhile, will take on China's Li Na in the third round after the 15th seed's 7-5, 6-0 win over Russian Vera Dushevina. Fourteenth seed Marion Bartoli ousted fellow Frenchwoman Aravene Rezai 6-4, 6-2 to reach the last 16 where she will play Russia's Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, conqueror of Will
