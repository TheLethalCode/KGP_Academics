 YANGON, Sep 28, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Myanmar's detained opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi has requested a meeting with Western diplomats to discuss sanctions imposed on the country, her party said on Monday.

The EU has had its sanctions in place since 1996, further tightened in 2007 after a harsh crackdown on monk-led protests. Australia has maintained visa restrictions on the regime and a ban on defence exports. Clinton said in July that the United States would help Myanmar if the regime ensured next year's long-awaited elections were free, fair and inclusive, and Suu Kyi, who has been in some form of detention for 14 of the past 20 years, was freed. Just weeks before her latest stint of house arrest was due to expire, a Myanmar court sentenced her to 18 months longer in detention for a security breach, a ruling condemned by the West and dismissed by critics as a ploy to minimise her influence ahead of the po
