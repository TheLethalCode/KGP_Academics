 Dhaka, Sep 30 (bdnews24.com)--Former BNP health minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain said on Wednesday the government was out to ruin the health sector by removing specialist doctors from prominent medical institutions. Referring to Tuesday's decision to sack 11 professors from Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Mosharraf, a member of the policymaking standing committee, demanded the government cancel the decision. The government sacked 10 professors and one associate professor from BSMMU apparently to purge the university of political appointees during the BNP-Jamaat coalition government. University registrar Abdul Gafur told bdnews24.com on Tuesday that the 11 had been "relieved" of their jobs because their appointments "flouted rules and were unlawful". The termination order was issued on Tuesday and will come into effect from 2pm on Wednesday, Gafur said. "The responsibility of the government is to ensure health services for the people of the country. This is not a party matter. I hope the government will play an objective and responsible role," he told a news conference in the office of BNP chairperson in Gulshan. He rejected the allegations that the sacked BSMMU specialists were appointed under political consideration. He claimed they were appointed following rules. "The government is transferring and harassing doctors," said the former health minister. "One investigation after another is going on at the BSMMU to sack those who were appointed from 2001-06. This is aimed at harassing them," he said. He said the health sector has been impacted hugely for promoting juniors over seniors under the current rule. "Medical education is on the verge of collapse," he said. "If it continues, the health sector will break down. People will be deprived of the health services," he said. He also demanded investigation of all anomalies from the inception of BSMMU. The former minister also said specialist doctors were being removed from Dhaka Medical College and Hospital, National Institute for Heart Disease and National Institute for Cardiovascular Disease. He demanded an immediate halt to such practices. Mosharraf also condemned the arrest of former state minister Aman Ullah Aman. Former state minister for health Mizanur Rahman Sinha, BNP joint secretary Selima Rahman, and other leaders including Mirza Abbas, Nazrul Islam Khan, Rizvi Ahmed, and chairperson's press secretary Maruf Kamal were present in the news conference. bdne
