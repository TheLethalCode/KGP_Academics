 Dhaka, Sep 29 (bdnews24.com)The government and the FBCCI on Tuesday formed two committees to investigate the price hike of sugar that dented the pockets of the people before this past Eid-ul-Fitr. One of those committees was formed by the commerce ministry, headed by additional secretary Mostafa Mohiuddin. The committees were formed at a meeting at the commerce ministry chaired by minister Faruq Khan to analyse the price increase of sugar. FBCCI president Anisul Huq was present. Both the committees were asked to submit their reports within 15 days, Huq said. After the meeting, Khan told reporters the government will identify those rogue traders who made the price go up even though there was enough stock and supply to the market, and take steps against them. This is a democratic government and it will ensure that no-one is harassed, he added. An official, who was present at the meeting, told bdnews24.com owners of the sugar mills said that 120,000 metric tonnes of sugar had been supplied during the Ramadan, while the business leaders of Moulovibazar said they got supply of only 27,000 metric tonnes. bd
