 Dhaka, Sep28 (bdnews24.com) --The government is mulling over extension of the Sep 30 deadline for eliciting opinions on the proposed national education policy, the education minister said. "We may consider the extension of the deadline responding to requests from different quarters," Nurul Islam Nahid told bdnews24.com on Monday. "We are yet to make any decision as we have 2-3 days' time in hand to decide the matter." On assuming power early in January, the ruling Awami League formed Education Policy Formulation Committee-2009 headed by professor Kabir Chowdhury. The committee submitted their recommendations to the minister on Sep 2. The committee made a set of recommendations including formation of a national education commission, upgrading of primary education up to class eight, extension of secondary up to twelfth class, introduction of some compulsory identical subjects at all syllabus. The report was handed over to the prime minister on Sep 4. The set of recommendations of National Education Policy Formulation Committee are available on the ministry's website for public opinions until Sep 30. "We are getting huge response with requests for extension of the deadline," the minister said. b
