<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 30 (bdnews24.com)Hearing of death reference on Bangabandhu murder trial will start on Oct 5 even though the lawyer of the defendants have opposed such move, attorney general Mahbubey Alam has said. Alam briefed reporters about the government's plan to request the court for hearing on Oct 5 after his meeting with law minister Shafique Ahmed on Wednesday at the minister's office. Khan Saifur Rahman, lawyer of the defendants, applied to the court for no hearing on the grounds that "the government had not submitted the concise statement from its side within the stipulated time". "It is not mandatory to submit the concise statement (on the case) to the court in 30 days. This is a directive. "Let the court decide whether it would hold the hearing," Alam told bdnews24.com on Wednesday night. According to legal practices, both sides should submit concise statements on the case in 30 days before the hearing date. State minister for law Quamrul Islam, Awami League presidium member Yusuf Hossain Humayun, prosecution counsel Anisul Haque and general secretary of Supreme Court Bar Association SM Rezaul Karim attended the long meeting, None of the ministers talked to the waiting reporters. The attorney general said request was made to the United States for information about lancer AKM Mohiuddin. Brief description is being submitted as no information was received from the US in time. He said, "The complete file is with the government. The file will be submitted to the court." Anisul Haque said, "It was a courtesy meeting with the law minister after Eid vacation. We also discussed about the death reference of Bangabandhu murder trial though. We hope that the hearing will start on Oct 5." Independence hero president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was killed with much of his family by some disgruntled military officers on Aug 15, 1975. The case was filed 21 years after the assassination that shook the nation to the core and changed the political landscape forever. No-one was allowed to file a case immediately after the assassination. The government of Khandker Mustaque Ahmed that was installed after the military putsch passed an ordinance in November that year indemnifying the perpetrators and closing the door on the possibility of a trial. The Awami League government revoked the indemnity ordinance in 1996 and cleared the way for that trial. Then the president, Sheikh Mujib's personal assistant Muhitul Islam on October 2, 1996 filed a case with Dhanmondi Police Station against 20 persons. On Nov 8, 1998, Dhaka sessions judge Golam Rasul awarded death sentence to 15 of the 20 accused persons. Four jailed accused major (retd) Bazlul Huda, lt col (sacked) Syed Faruk Rahman, lt col (retd) Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and lt col (red) Mohiuddin Ahmed appealed in the High Court against the trial court verdict. On Dec 14, 2000 the High Court gave a split verdict in the case: Justice Md Ruhul Amin upheld death sentence of 10 accused but Justice ABM Khairul Haque retained death sentence of 15 accused. On April 30, 2001 Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim of a third High Court bench upheld death sentence of 12 accused and acquitted three. Of the 12 death convicts, four jailed accused submitted leave to appeal in the Appellate Division in the same year. Another death convict, lancer AKM Mohiuddin, made an appeal from jail after he was deported from the United States on June 18 last year. Of those having received death sentence, Rashid, Lt Col Shariful Haq Dalim, Lt Col Noor, Risalder Moslemuddin, Lt Col Rashed Chowdhury and Col Majed are absconding. Absconding accused Aziz Pasha died in Zimbabwe. President Zillur Rahman appointed four new judges to the Appellate Division on July 14 this year, raising the total number of judges to an unprecedented 11 in the highest appeals court that has long been hamstrung by the shortage, and cleared the way for the Bangabandhu murder trial among other to see a conclusion. bdnews24
