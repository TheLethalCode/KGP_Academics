 Dhaka, Sep28 (bdnews24.com) Leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia on Monday demanded security for all citizens and said that ruling party men have unleashed a reign of terror across the country. In a statement, the BNP chief alleged that panic prevails everywhere as criminals backed by the ruling party have "created a reign of terror". She continued: "There's no sense of security for anybody at any place, including localities, offices, businesses and educational institutions." Referring to a letter sent recently to the government by diplomats based in Dhaka over their security, Khaleda said: "We want an end to such situation." The former premier also demanded authorities probe reported death threat at gunpoint to a senior army official deputed to the engineering division of the Dhaka City Corporation. The incident occurred on Sunday reportedly over promotion of engineers. Superintendent engineer M Faruk Aziz allegedly made the threat on the life of Brig Gen Abdul Kadir, the DCC chief engineer, over filling up the vacant post of additional engineer, for which Aziz is an aspirant. Khaleda also condemned the incident and said the threat was given by an engineer who is tied to the ruling Awami League. "We are deeply concerned at the incident of threat on life to a senior army officer by an engineer loyal to ruling party," the statement reads. bdne
