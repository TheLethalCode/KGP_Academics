 Kamran Reza Chowdhury and Moinul Hoque Chowdhury bdnews24.com Correspondents Dhaka, Sept 30 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary panel has dropped the provision of appointing bureaucrats as administrators to the Union Parishad in absence of elected councils in a proposed law on the lowest tier of the local government. The parliamentary standing committee on local government ministry on Wednesday also made ways for the utility bill defaulters to contest the polls. The watchdog finally recommended that the contestants must not provide affidavit on their personal lives along with the nomination papers. The committee chairman will present the recommendations on the proposed Local Government (Union Parishad) Bill-2009 in parliament which will pass the bill in the ongoing third session, parliament secretariat sources say. Local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam on Sept 13 tabled the bill, the draft of which was referred to the standing committee for further scrutiny. "We have unanimously recommended that there should no provision for appointing bureaucrats as administrators to the Union Parishad in absence of elected councils," Rahmat Ali, the chairman, said to bdnews24.com on Wednesday after a meeting at parliament building. Section 18 of the draft bill authorised the government to appoint administrators, a provision considered as an instrument for the government to directly control the Parishad. The standing committee, however, did not change the proposed provisions authorising the government to suspend an elected Union Parishad if it considered any action of the Parishad is against the interest of the council from "an administrative point of view". "We have had experiences that the government appointed administrators to the Union Parishad and the bureaucrats held the posts for up to 8 years. "No election took place," said Ali, a senior Awami League MP. He said the proposed bill had a provision of electing a three-member panel of chairmen from the elected members of the council. "The provision of the panel of chairmen renders the appointment of administrators irrelevant." "We have recommended that the government should hold by-elections to the Parishad in 90 days since the vacation of any post," said the chairman. He said his committee was in favour of allowing the utility bill defaulters run the polls for practical reasons. The section 26 of the bill says that any contestant would disqualify if they do not pay utility bills such as land development tax, telephone, water, gas, electricity and other bills for one year. The Election Commission earlier asked the government to delete the provision from the draft bill. The commission also proposed that the government do not make attaching affidavit to the nomination paper mandatory for the polls aspirants. Section 20 made attaching affidavit containing personal information on the candidates mandatory. "We have removed the provision of giving affidavits for the candidates as the Election Commission has no manpower to examine the affidavits of the contestants," said Monowar Hossain, a committee member. He said if the provision was kept, the commission would face the arduous task of handling more than 250,000 affidavits. "The candidates will have to go to the notary public advocates in a short span of time. "We do not have required number of advocates to prepare affidavits," said Hossain. bdn
