 Abdur Rahim Harmachhi Senior Economics Correspondent Dhaka, Sep 29 (bdnews24.com)Hoping to lure more people to pay, the National Board of Revenue decided on Monday that the present and potential income tax payers would be given one more month to submit their returns. NBR chairman Nasir Uddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com that the new deadline would now be Oct 31, considering the long holidays due to the Eid-ul-Fitr and the Durga Puja. The extension came following requests from different trading bodies including the apex FBCCI. The NBR chief said there are more than 22 lakh TIN holders, but only seven lakh pay taxes. "The TIN holders can pay tax for the whole month of October," Nasir said. Last year, the Sep 30 deadline was extended twicea month each time. NBR officials would not speculate whether a second extension of the deadline was likely this year too. Finance minister A M A Muhith said recently the number was too low, describing it as "shameful". The minister told a ceremony launching the online income tax return submission programme of Large Taxpayers Unit (LTU) on Jul 9 that surveys would be carried out in 15 areas of the country to increase the number of taxpayers. Muhith had also unveiled plans to prevent tax dodge, collect tax from all TIN holders and catch those with fake TINs. In an Income Tax Day programme recently, he said the government had set a target to collect income tax worth Tk 20,000 crore in the last fiscal year of its tenure. In the 2008-2009 fiscal year, the NBR could collect around Tk 13,812 crore. bdnews24.co
