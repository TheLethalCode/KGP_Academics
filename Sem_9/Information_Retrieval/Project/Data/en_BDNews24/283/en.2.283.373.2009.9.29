 Dhaka, Sep 29 (bdnews24.com)--A Dhaka court has ordered Dhanmondi police to consider the quashed torture case as statement against three, including former deputy police commissioner Kohinoor Miah. Judge Emdadul Haq of Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court gave the order on Tuesday morning. Md Atiur Rahman, husband of Shahina Sultana Shanta, told bdnews24.com, "The case didn't require judicial investigation. The judge ordered police to recognise the case directly as a statement." Additional judge Ismail Hossain of Dhaka's Fourth Metropolitan Sessions' Judge's Court on Sunday ordered departmental investigation. The case details said Shanta was badly beaten by police in front of Rapa Plaza at Dhanmondi on Mar 12, 2006 while she was returning home with her son from school on the orders of Kohinoor. Police also kicked at her lower abdomen that caused a miscarriage. Shanta filed a torture case with the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court two days after the incident, against Kohinoor, then deputy commissioner of Dhaka (South) Majharul Haque and constable Ruhul Amin. The Criminal Investigation Department was asked to investigate the case, but CID officer Ali Haidari submitted a report claiming that there was no proof of the incident. Shanta filed a petition against the report on Sep 27 the same year. She sought a judicial inquiry into the case saying the police cannot be neutral in an investigation against policemen. Later, then Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Shafique Anwar submitted another report after departmental investigation where he said the incident did not happen altogether. The court then rejected another petition by Shanta, following which, on Oct 30, 2006, Shanta requested a revision at the Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions' Judge's Court against the order. bdnews
