 CENTURION, South Africa, Sept 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia reached 234 for four off 42.3 overs before heavy rain forced the abandonment of their Champions Trophy Group A match against India at Centurion on Monday. Both teams earned a point, leaving India without a win in the competition. Pakistan head the group on four points and they will play Australia, on three, at Centurion on Wednesday.
