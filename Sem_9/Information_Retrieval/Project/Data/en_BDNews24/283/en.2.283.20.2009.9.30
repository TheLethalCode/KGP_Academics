 MUMBAI, Sep 30, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The BSE Sensex surged past 17,000 points on Wednesday for the first time since May 2008, rising 1.6 percent in its best rise in three weeks as investors bet on strong quarterly earnings due from next week. Helped by soaring foreign portfolio inflows the index logged its third consecutive quarterly gain, rising 18.2 percent in the September quarter -- the longest run of quarterly gains since end 2007 and followed a 49 percent jump in the June quarter. It rose 9.3 percent in the month. Sentiment was also boosted by firm opening in Europe and indication of a positive start on Wall Street, traders said. Shares in leading mobile firm Bharti Airtel slipped in late trade to end 0.07 percent lower at 418.55 rupees, as exclusive talks deadline loomed for a tie-up with South Africa's MTN Group.

It has risen 77.3 percent so far in 2009, making it one of the best performing indices in the region. "For foreign institutions, investing in India is no longer an option, it is a compulsion," said Jayesh Shroff, fund manager at SBI Mutual Fund, said. "The direction for the market at least in the short term is clearly up." Foreign funds have moved $3.6 billion into Indian stocks so far this month, taking their yearly pickings to $11.9 billion. "There is visibility in terms of earnings which is adding to the confidence," said Rajesh Jain, chief executive at Pranav Securities. Companies begin releasing their quarterly results from the second week of October, and advance tax payments indicate robust profits. Top lender State Bank of India climbed 5 percent to 2,195.70, its highest close since February last year as investors expected strong corporate earnings to boost the bank's profits and ease bad debt worries. No. 2 lender ICICI Bank rallied 4.6 percent to 904.80 rupees, its highest close since May 21, 2008. Energy giant Reliance Industries gained 1.6 percent to 2,201.20 rupees.
