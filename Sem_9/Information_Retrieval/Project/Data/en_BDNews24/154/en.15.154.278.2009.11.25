 ISLAMABAD, Nov 25, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani security agencies have detained a former army officer for possible links with two men arrested in Chicago on terrorism charges, an army spokesman said on Wednesday. David Headley and Tahawwur Hussain Rana were arrested last month and accused of planning an attack on Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten, which ran cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad in 2005, sparking protests by Muslims in several countries. Rana is a Pakistan-born Canadian citizen while Headley is an American citizen who had spent time in Pakistan, which is under US pressure to crack down harder on militants along the border with Afghanistan to help it put down a Taliban insurgency there. Pakistani military spokesman Major-General Athar Abbas said a former army major was detained in connection with the case. "He's still in detention and is being questioned," he said, adding that no serving officer has been detained in the case. According to US court documents, the Chicago pair discussed their planned attack on the Danish newspaper with members of Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba group and al Qaeda-linked Pakistan-based militant Ilyas Kashmiri. Lashkar, blamed for the 2008 Mumbai assault, also talked to them about possible attacks in India and suggested these should be given priority over the alleged plot in Denmark. Lashkar has denied links with the Chicago arrests. Once nurtured by Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) spy agency to fight India in Kashmir, Lashkar shares al Qaeda's concept of global jihad, as underscored by its alleged willingness to support the planned attack in Denmark. Officials have long worried that Lashkar could use its big network of support in the Pakistani diaspora to hit Western targets. Pakistani authorities officially banned Lashkar after it was blamed for a 2001 attack on the Indian parliament. But analysts say it is unofficially tolerated as it is not believed to have been involved in attacks inside Pakistan, where the government is fighting Taliban militants. Pakistani authorities put seven Lashkar members on trial for their links to the Mumbai violence that killed 166 people, while the group's founder, Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, was briefly put under house arrest. Authorities also closed the offices of Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD), a charity headed by Saeed, after the United Nations said it was a new alias for Lashkar and put it on a terrorist list in 2008. However, JuD has apparently re-emerged under the name Falah-i-Insaniat Foundation (Foundation for Welfare of Humanity), and its cadres were involved in relief activities for people displaced by an army offensive against Taliban militants in Pakistan's northwestern Swat valley in May. It has also launched a weekly newspaper, Jarrar (Bra
