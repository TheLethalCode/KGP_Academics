 Dhaka, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com)--Relatives visited Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery), now on the death row for killing independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, at Dhaka Central Jail on Tuesday. Mohiuddin's wife and four other relatives saw him inside the condemned cell for half an hour after midday, jail superintendent Touhidul Islam told bdnews24.com. The officials of intelligence agencies were present there at the time, he said. Mohiuddin is the last of the death convicts to receive visitors. Earlier, AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed (lancer), Bazlul Huda, Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Syed Faruk Rahman were visited by their relatives on Sunday and Monday since their death sentences were upheld. The Supreme Court on Nov 19 in a final verdict confirmed death sentences on the five former army officers for the murder of 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujib and most of his family members, ending the long-drawn case proceedings of more than 34 years. The long-awaited judgment cleared the way for hanging of all 12 former army officers convicted of the Aug 15, 1975 assassination, six of whom are fugitives and one of whom has since died. Lawyers for the jailed convicts have said they will submit a review petition with the Supreme Court. If that fails, their last resort is a mercy petition to the president. Amnesty International, which seeks a worldwide moratorium on the death penalty, has urged Bangladesh to show clemency to the killers by commuting their death sentences in this high-profile case. b
