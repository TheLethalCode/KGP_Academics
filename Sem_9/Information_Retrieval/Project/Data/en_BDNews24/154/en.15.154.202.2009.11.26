 Dhaka, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com)--The government has decided to drop 175 more politically motivated cases, state minister for law has said. The decision came from the 10th meeting of the committee on withdrawal of political harassment related cases on Thursday. The committee has so far recommended for cancellation of 1,348 cases filed by the Anticorruption Commission and under Bangladesh Penal Code, committee's chairman Quamrul Islam told reporters on Thursday. No cases against the BNP led four-party alliance leaders were placed in the meeting, Islam said. "We are recommending for withdrawal of cases deemed politically harassed. "If we find any case politically motivated against any BNP-Jamaat leader we will recommend for its withdrawal," he said. The committee needs two more months to complete its activities, the state minister said. Of the total 675 cases placed in the meeting, 24 were filed by the ACC while 651 under the CrPC, Islam said. "Recommendations were made to withdraw 16 cases filed by the ACC and seven cases were marked for disposal in the next meeting for review. "A total of 195 cases under the penal code were recommended for cancellation. Some 29 cases were rejected and 463 cases to be placed before the next meeting," the state minister added. The recommendations were made for withdrawal of nine cases filed against Chittagong mayor ABM Mohiuddin Ahmed, one each against Jatiya Party general secretary Ruhul Amin Hawlader, MPs Kamal Ahmed Majumder and Ilias Mollah, two cases each former MP Hazi Selim and former Proshika chairman Qazi Faruk Ahmed. The Awami League-led government, soon after assuming office in January, announced that it would look into cases filed during the past administrations against politicians and others for "political harassment only". The government has invited applications seeking cancellation of such cases since February, forming district-level vetting committees and a central scrutiny committee under the home ministry. The deadline for applications was extended thrice up to July 12. Its first meeting, on June 10, the committee recommended withdrawal of 62 cases, including 12 against prime minister Sheikh Hasina. On June 21, it approved another 46 cases for cancellation. In its third meeting on July 1, the committee recommended quashing another 66 cases. On July 15, it recommended 69 cases be cancelled. On Aug 5, in its fifth meeting, the committee recommended cancellation of 121 cases, on Aug 26, it recommended withdrawal of 105 cases, on Sept 16, 123 cases, on Oct 13 in its eighth meeting it recommended cancellation of 297 cases and on Nov 12 in its ninth meeting it recommended withdrawal of another 293 cases. b
