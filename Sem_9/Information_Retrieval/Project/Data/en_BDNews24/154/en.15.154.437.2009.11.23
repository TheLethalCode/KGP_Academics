 Dhaka, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com)US ambassador James F Moriarty has said the Urdu-speaking "Biharis" should get equal rights with the Bengalis as per the Bangladesh's constitution. He also said the people living in the city's "Geneva Camp" in Mohammadpur area wanted to go outside the camp to contribute to the country's development process. The ambassador made the remarks after visiting the overcrowded Geneva Camp which houses about 25,000 Urdu-speaking people who opposed Bangladesh's independence in 1971 and supported Pakistan army in killing Bengalis. "I came here as a follow up to see what has happened following the Supreme Court decision to grant the Urdu speakers the citizenship in the country," Moriarty told reporters after the visit. "I am encouraged to see that they are eager to be the part of the mainstream life here in Bangladesh," he said. The Supreme Court on May 18, 2008 in a verdict asked the government to give the 'Biharis', or stranded Pakistanis, voting rights. The Election Commission estimates that around 40,000 are of voting age. Most were registered as voters from refugee camps in August last year. Some of the Biharis still call themselves stranded Pakistanis. The court said those who claimed themselves as Pakistanis should decide their own fate. The ambassador had a meeting with the Bihari leaders inside the camp after inspecting the rooms in the camps. Replying to media queries, Moriarty said his government had suggestion for Bangladesh on this issue. "But I think Bangladesh has a constitution that is very clear that all of its citizens are entitled to the same rights in terms of political development, economic development and social development," said the ambassador. "These are their citizens. These are the government citizens." The Urdu-speakers and the government should settle the issue, he said. "The people living here believe that their future lies outside the camp... and [they should] become an integral part of society," he said. Moriarty said his government would provide assistance for the development of the 'Biharis' and the country as a whole. About 160,000 Urdu-speaking Biharis came to the then East Pakistan from India during partition of the sub-continent in 1947. The Biharis, who chose to be citizens of Pakistan instead of being Hindu-majority India's citizens in 1947, supported the occupation Pakistan army killing the Bengalis in 1971. The Biharis also killed many Bengalis even after the surrender of Pakistan army on Dec 16, 1971. Some sections of the Bangladeshi freedom fighters retaliated after the defeat of Pakistan on Dec 16, 1971 after a nine-month bloody war. The International Red Cross with the help of the Bangladesh government started looking after the Biharis in different camps across the country since 1972. The Biharis preferred identifying themselves as stranded Pakistanis to Bangladeshis. Out of the total half a million Biharis, Pakistan took back 100,000 in the 1970s, but about 200,000 Biharis still live in 116 refugee camps across the country. Pakistan has so far refused to repatriate the rest despite pressure from Dhaka.
