 Dhaka, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com)--Hundreds of thousands of homebound holidaymakers were waiting for buses in the capital's terminals on Friday afternoon, a day ahead of the Eid-ul-Azha. Buses bound for northern and southern regions were delayed in their departure from the city on Thursday due to gridlock on the roads causing suffering to the passengers. Ehsan Lenin, a Comilla-bound passenger, went to Sayedabad bus terminal at 5am but he could not get into any bus even after the midday. "I had to return home yesterday after waiting for hours. I have been waiting for bus since dawn, but there is no bus," he said. "Let's see what happens," said Lenin, who is still hopeful of getting a bus and joining with his family to celebrate the Eid. Like Lenin, thousand of people were waiting for buses in Sayedabad bus terminal, the major departure hub of buses bound for the south and north-eastern districts. Bus owners and operators said buses were coming late due to heavy gridlock on the highways. Sultana, who wanted to go to her in-law's house to celebrate the first Eid, could not catch any bus. It is impossible for women and children to board the buses that come to the terminal after long time. Many were forced to get onto the roofs risking lives. Passengers allege the counters had demanded charges twice or thrice the rate. Moinul Haque Chowdhury, a Chittagong-bound passenger, said his bus left Sayedabad at 11:30pm on Thursday. He crossed Daudkandi at midday on Friday. It takes from one hour to one and a half hours to cross Daudkandi in normal time, but the long traffic snarl meant it took 13 hours. The same scenario is in the Gabtoli bus terminal, the major departure place of the north-bound buses. There is huge gridlock from Gabtoli through Nabinagar, but it is normal from Nabinagar to Aricha, local correspondents report. Traffic sergeants were controlling traffic on the Dhaka-Tangail highway as there was a chaos on the route. The distance between Dhaka and Tangail is 100 kilometres, but it is now taking seven to eight hours. bdnews24.com correspondent Golam Mortuza Antu said he had seen at least 1,000 passengers waiting at Hanif Paribahan in Gabtoli terminal in the first hours of Friday. Police and bus operators blamed the chaos on the cattle markets thrown up on roads and highways. bdnews24.
