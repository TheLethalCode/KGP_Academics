<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com)Relatives of Syed Faruk Rahman, the convicted murderer of nation's founding father 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, visited him on Monday in Dhaka Central Jail. Jail superintendent Touhidul Islam told bdnews24.com Faruk's mother, sister and sister-in-law saw him inside the condemned cell for half an hour in the afternoon. The representatives of jail authorities and intelligence agents were present there at the time, he said. On Sunday, relatives visited three other death convicts--AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed (lancer), Bazlul Huda and Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, the first visits allowed since the Supreme Court upheld their death sentences. Another death convict Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery) has not received any visitor yet, Islam said. The Supreme Court on Nov 19 rejected the appeals of the five former officers sentenced to death for the murder of president Sheikh Mujib and most of his family members, sealing the long-drawn case proceedings more than 34 years after the killings. The long-awaited judgment cleared the way for hanging of all 12 former army officers convicted of the Aug 15, 1975 assassination, six of whom are fugitives, one of whom has since died. Lawyers for the jailed convicts have said they will submit a review petition with the Supreme Court. If that fails, their last resort is a mercy petition to the president. Amnesty International, which seeks a worldwide moratorium on the death penalty, has urged Bangladesh to show clemency to the killers by commuting their death sentences in this high-profile case. b
