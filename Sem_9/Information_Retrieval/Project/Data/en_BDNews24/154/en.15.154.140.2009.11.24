 Dhaka, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com)The High Court on Tuesday ordered the government not to bar senior BNP leader and MP Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury from going abroad for two months, his lawyer said. The bench of justice Nazrul Islam Chowdhury and justice Mamnun Rahman issued the order on a petition by Chowdhury earlier in the day. It also asked the government to explain why any travel restriction should not be declared illegal. Chowdhury filed the petition challenging the legality of barring him from travel abroad after he was stopped from flying the previous day. Shah Monjurul Haque, lawyer for the BNP leader, said Chowdhury, who was to leave for Singapore on Monday for a medical check-up, was prevented from boarding an aircraft. Immigration officials at Zia International Airport stopped the senior opposition leader, saying he needed to secure a court order to leave the country. The airport officials said they were asked by the government not to let him go abroad. Chowdhury faces a number of cases filed across the country, involving charges of "defaming the memory of Sheikh Mujib Rahman" with a comment he made on the occasion of Mujib's death anniversary in August this year. The BNP leader also faces allegations of 1971 war crimes. The present government is firm on trying all accused war criminals, with preparations almost complete for a special tribunal to start proceedings. bdnew
