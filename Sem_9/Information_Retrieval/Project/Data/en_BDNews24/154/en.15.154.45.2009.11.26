 Brahmanbaria, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com)Local authorities enforced a Section 144 ban on public meetings in Ashuganj on Thursday after three rival BNP factions announced conferences at the same time and venue. Ashuganj upazila nirbahi officer Saiful Islam said the three rival groups called their workers and supporters to assemble at 3pm at Abdul Jalil High School compound. "In a bid to maintain law and order, the administration had to impose Section 144 at the venue from 9am," he said. Ashuganj police chief Abu Zafar said local BNP leaders Md Idris Miah, Touhidul Islam Nasir and Alamgir Kabir each claiming to be "the upazila BNP convenor" called the meetings separately. Former state ministers Abdus Sattar Bhuiyan and Harun Al Rashid, also the district BNP convenor, were scheduled to attend the Ashuganj BNP conference, he said. Tension and unrest were prevailing, said locals, but police have been posted around the school compound. bdne
