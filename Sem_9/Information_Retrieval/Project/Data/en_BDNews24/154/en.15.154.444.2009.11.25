 Dhaka, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com)Photographer Nawazesh Ahmed died of a heart attack on Tuesday. Nawazesh, 80, had just attended a "Celebrating Life" awards programme organised by The Daily Star and Standard Chartered Bank, when he collapsed and fell leaving the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre. He was pronounced dead at the National Institute of Cardio Vascular Diseases at 9.45pm, Dr Moshedur Rahman, duty doctor at the Institute's cardiac care unit, said. Dr Rahman told bdnews24.com the octogenarian fell unconscious conference centre premises as he was leaving the programme. "He was immediately rushed to the nearby Suhrawardy Hospital, where doctors advised his transfer to our emergency room," said the doctor. "He died on his way here." Rahman said the famed photographer and scientist had almost certainly suffered a massive heart attack. Born in Manikganaj, Nawazesh was an agricultural scientist, as well as one of the most successful landscape photographers of the country. He produced numerous books on photography, including "Bangladesh", the first picture album published in the country in 1975.
