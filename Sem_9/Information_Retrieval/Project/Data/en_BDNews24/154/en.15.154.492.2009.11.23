 Dhaka, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com)--The BNP's national council, slated for Dec 8, will not defer even though internal squabbling foiled district councils, joint secretary general Goyeshwar Chandra Roy said on Monday. The main opposition party has prepared council logo, website and theme music for the council scheduled to be held at Bangabandhu International Conference Centre. "Today, a conference was to be held at Shatkhira but section 144 has been declared there. Despite opposition from administration our national council would be held on Dec 8. "There is no scope of delaying the council," Goyeshwar, also convener of the publicity sub-committee of the National Council, told reporters at the party headquarters in Naya Paltan. The programme would be inaugurated at 10am to be followed by a closed-door council meeting at noon and a cultural programme in the evening. BNP has to hold the council by Jan 25 to approve the amended party constitution and continue being registered with the Election Commission. He alleged that the government was creating barriers to holding councils to choose new district committees. "The publicity campaign would start before Eid using the theme music, ringtones, seven-coloured council monogram, t-shirts, caps, pens, coat pins and billboards." Goyeshwar said, "The incidents that occurred in BNP's district councils are organisational matters. It will not affect the national council. In a major party, this sort of separations or meetings might occur." The new theme song of the party council was created following US president Barack Obama's presidential election song "Yes we can". The press meet also informed journalists about various advertisements and talk shows on TV, radio and national dailies. Also, a website and facebook group was launched on the internet ahead of the council.
