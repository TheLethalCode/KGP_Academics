 BEIJING Nov 24, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China and isolated North Korea should deepen military ties, the Chinese defence minister said on Tuesday, saying international turbulence had never damaged the bond between the two communist neighbours. Defence Minister Liang Guanglie's comments, reported by China's Xinhua news agency during a visit to the reclusive state, were the latest sign that Beijing is seeking to shore up sometimes strained ties with North Korea, even as the North faces international sanctions over its nuclear weapons programme. Liang told his North Korean counterpart, Kim Yong-chun, that military ties between the two countries were an "important part" of their relationship, Xinhua reported. "China and North Korea established relations 60 years ago, and no matter how stormy the international changes, the traditional friendship between us has always advanced," said Liang.

Wen was greeted with fanfare by the North's usually reclusive top leader, Kim Jong-il. Since then, China's president Hu Jintao has also invited Kim to visit.

Beijing responded by backing sanctions against North Korea authorised by the United Nations Security Council. Since 2003, China has hosted six-party talks aimed at ending the North's nuclear arms plans in return for aid and energy. Those talks have stalled under complaints from Pyongyang. Recent conciliatory words from the North, and a scheduled visit by a US envoy next month, have revived some hopes for renewed negotiations. The talks bring together North and South Korea, China, the United States, Japan and Russia. But China fears tough sanctions on the North could simply alienate and rile that country's wary leaders, and could stoke instability and risk pushing a wave of refugees across the border into northeast China. Such fears have prompted China's leaders to place fresh emphasis on nurturing stronger bilateral ties with the North, analysts have said. Liang "reiterated the Chinese government's principles and positions on issues concerning the Korean Peninsula," the Xinhua report said, without directly mentioning the nuclear disp
