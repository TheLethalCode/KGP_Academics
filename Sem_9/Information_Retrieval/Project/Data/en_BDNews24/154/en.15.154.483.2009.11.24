 Naryanganj, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com)--Former BNP government's deputy minister Abdus Salam Pintu was taken for a third grilling session of two days by the CID in the case regarding bomb attack on Chashara Awami League office. Naryanganj's chief judicial magistrate Arifur Rahman granted the two days on a plea for five days and ordered the interrogators to be careful due to Pintu's physical condition. He was taken into CID remand for two sessions before, one for five days on Nov 15 and another for three days on Nov 20. Khokon Saha represented the government, while Bari Bhuiyan, Abdul Hamid Khan Bhasani and Khorshed Alam Molla pleaded for the defendant at the hearing. The lawyers opposed the petition for remand and appealed for his bail. In-charge of Naryanganj CID camp and investigating officer of the case, M Yousuf Ali Molla, told bdnews24.com, "Pintu gave some valuable information regarding the case in the second remand session. That is why we have asked for permission to further question him." The bomb attack on Chashara AL office on June 16, 2001 left 20 dead and about 50 AL members including former MP Shamim Osman injured. bdnews
