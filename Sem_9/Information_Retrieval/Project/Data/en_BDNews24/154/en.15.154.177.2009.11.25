 Dhaka, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com)--The BNP has extended the deadline for holding district councils by five more days. "We have decided to extend the deadline until Nov 30," office secretary Rizvi Ahmed told a briefing at the party's Naya Paltan office on Wednesday. "Today was the last day for holding district councils. But many districts could not hold councils due to the obstructions by the ruling party and the administration," he said. The councils were supposed to take place at 60 percent districts until Wednesday and it would be possible to hold councils of the 78 district committees by Nov 30, he said. Ahmed accused the administration and the ruling Awami League of putting hurdles to holding councils. "They (the government) do not want that BNP councils are held successfully. They are plotting to foil the national council, the ruling party has been trying to split the party since 1/11 changeover. "They are clamping section 144 by carrying out attacks or through the administration in the council venues." The BNP leader referred to Satkhira and Lalmonirhat councils. On the feuds between Chittagong metropolitan and south Chittagong units over holding councils, Ahmed said: "There is no grouping in the BNP. There is competition on the question of leadership." He said they are taking preparations to hold the national council slated for Dec 8
