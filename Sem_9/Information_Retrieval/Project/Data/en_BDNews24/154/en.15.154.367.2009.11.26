 bdnews24.com New Delhi Correspondent New Delhi, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com)  They were born and grew up on two sides of the border. They met on the web and fell in love. They then defied the frontier separating them to come together. But the long arms of the laws of the lands they were born in have caught up with them and are now trying to part the young couple. Doesn't it sound like something straight out of a celluloid tearjerker? But the tale of Shazia Zarin of Bangladesh and Zubair Khan of India is too true to be a film. And that's why the desperate young couple has of late written to Indian president Pratibha Patil and prime minister Manmohan Singh with a plea to let them live together  happily ever after with their child who is expected in three months. Shazia, daughter of a wealthy businessman of Dhaka, came to Delhi in February this year and married her beau Zubair, son of a realtor in the national capital of India, against the wishes of her family. Her father has now moved Delhi High Court seeking his daughter's deportation from India. He claimed that Shazia, a citizen of Bangladesh, was illegally staying in India. Shazia, 23, and Zubair, 27, met on social networking site Facebook three years ago and were eventually struck by the Cupid. Zubair says he had traveled to Dhaka four times to meet Shazia and her parents. "Shazia's father and others in the family liked me initially and even endorsed her desire to marry me," he claims and adds: "But something suddenly went wrong and he turned against me and decided not to let his daughter to tie the knot with me." But Shazia stuck to her decision. She fled Dhaka and reached Delhi on February 12 this year. The couple now claims that they got married the next day itself. Angry over her desperate move, Shazia's father got in touch with his contacts in Delhi. And a complaint was lodged in East Delhi's Shakarpur Police Station against Zubair accusing him of kidnapping Shazia. Zubair later filed a writ petition to the Delhi High Court alleging that police were unnecessarily harassing him, his wife and other members of his family. The High Court in its order on July 21 asked police not to harass the couple and any other member of the family. But Shazia's father too got a writ petition filed in the High Court seeking her deportation. The petitioner also challenged the legitimacy of Shazia's marriage to Zubair and claimed that she had already been married to someone in Bangladesh in 2006. Her father's lawyer says that Shazia's family in Dhaka believes that Zubair was forcing her to stay back in Delhi. Zubair says that Shazia came to India in February on a valid one-month visa, which was extended for another month. She, however, staying in Delhi without Indian visa since mid-April. Acting on the petition filed on behalf of Shazia's father, Justice V K Jain of the Delhi High Court on November 17 last ordered her to appear before the court on December 10 next. With only a few days to go before she has to appear before the High Court, Shazia recently wrote to Patil, Singh and chairpersons of the India's National Human Rights Commission and National Women's Commission seeking their interventions to end her ordeal and to ensure that she could stay with her husband in India. The couple claimed that Shazia was in advanced stage of pregnancy and enclosed medical reports in support of the claim with their appeals to the Indian president and prime minister.
