 MANILA, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Philippines sacked the provincial police chief and sent hundreds of extra troops to a southern region on Tuesday where gunmen killed at least 24 people in the worst-ever election related violence in the country. The election process for the May 2010 national polls began last week with the filing of candidacies for more than 17,800 national and local positions. Elections in the Philippines are usually marred by violence, especially in the south, where security forces are battling communist rebels, Islamic radicals and clan rivalries. On Monday, about 100 gunmen abducted a group of people going to file a nomination for the provincial governor's post. A group of about 40 people, including women and local journalists, were taken away by gunmen who opened fire on them, investigators said. Twenty-four bodies have been recovered and a local leader said four survivors were in hiding. President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo condemned the violence and ordered extra troops to the region. "No effort will be spared to bring justice to the victims and hold the perpetrators accountable to the full limit of the law," she said at the start of a special cabinet meeting to discuss ways to control the violence. The Maguindanao provincial police chief was sacked. Interior Secretary Ronaldo Puno said investigations would be completed within a couple of days and arrests made. "There are no sacred cows," he told television. "It is going to be a direct investigation of the crimes committed. We have some information about specific names, not just those who ordered this thing, but also those who committed it." CLAN RIVALRY Military officials said the dead included Genalyn Tiamzon-Mangudadatu, who was on the way to file the nomination of Esmael, her husband, to contest the governorship of Maguindanao against Datu Andal Ampatuan, the head of a powerful local family. Ampatuan has been elected governor of Maguindanao three times previously, always unopposed, although he resigned from the post earlier this year, apparently to circumvent term limits on elected officials. One of his sons is the governor of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, an area which covers six provinces, and the family is politically allied to Arroyo. None of the Ampatuans made any coment to local or foreign media. Esmael Mangudadatu, Genalyn's husband, told radio that four people who escaped the massacre in Maguindanao province were under his care. "They will come out at the right time, they are safe with us," he said. The southern Philippines is riven by clan rivalries, including one between the Mangudadatus and the Ampatuans. Many politicians and elected officials in the region maintain well-equipped private armies. The army and police said they found 24 bodies near the vehicles in a hilly area off the highway, but there were no details on whether the rest were also killed. "Most bodies were lying on the ground and some in the vehicles," said Chief Superintendent Felicisimo Khu. "Most were shot with M-16s." M-16 automatic rifles are widely used by security forces, local militias, rebels and bandits in the region.
