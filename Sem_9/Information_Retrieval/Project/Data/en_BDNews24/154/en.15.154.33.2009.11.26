 Dhaka, Nov 26(bdnews24.com)--Over 4.30 lakh people, including more than one lakh women, have gained job opportunities for Tk 100 a day each under an employment project for the extreme poor, which was launched throughout the country in October. Some 1,20,000 people initially became beneficiaries of the project that targets hardcore poor, including those in Monga-prone, river erosion and Char and Haor regions across the country. The present government's 'Employment Project for the Extreme Poor', is a continuation of a scheme under the '100-Day Job Creation Programme' initiated by the previous interim government, earmarking Tk 2,000 crore in the last budget to employ 20 lakh rural poor under the social safety net scheme. The Economic Relations Division has allocated Tk 1,120 crore for the current project. A recent evaluation by FAO and BRAC Research Group says the project is so far reaching the extreme poor and leaving a positive effect, but there are some areas in the plan that need to be addressed to further boost its performance. Food secretary Mokhlesur Rahman told bdnews24.com on Wednesday the programme has, so far, covered 16 districts, including five Monga-prone and 11 cyclone Aila-hit districts. Extreme poor people are getting the benefits of the project in some places due to the greater involvement of deputy commissioners, UNOs and Upazila and Union Parisad chairmen, Rahman said. Officials involved with project implementation said the first phase of the project is going to complete in end-November and the second phase will begin in March next year, they said. The 100-day job-generation programme is expected to be continued for five years. Officials claimed that the government had taken strict measures to closely monitor the programme to guard against corruption and irregularities. Ten deputy secretaries at the food ministry are in charge of inspection and monitoring of the programme to see if any corruption or irregularities are taking place at the field level. They have got a satisfactory evaluation of the programme, public relations officer at the ministry, SM Golam Kibria, told bdnews24.com. According to the inspection and monitoring team, the project has played a positive role in removing poverty from the lives of the extreme poor people in Monga-prone, river erosion affected areas and Char and Haor-Baor regions. Currently, some 7,000 small projects under the programme are being implemented in 16 districts across the country. The food ministry, has so, far allocated over Tk 177.54 crore to implement the projects. Around Tk 7.0 crore has, so far, been spent on the projects taken up in rural areas.
