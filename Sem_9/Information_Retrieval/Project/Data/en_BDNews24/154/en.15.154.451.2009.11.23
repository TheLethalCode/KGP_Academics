 Dhaka, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com)The government begins the trial of BDR mutiny suspects on Tuesday, with proceedings kicking off in Rangamati BDR sector headquarters, a BDR official in Dhaka said on Monday. "The trial will begin from Tuesday at Special Court-4 under the BDR Act," deputy director general at the paramilitary force, Brig Gen Obaidul Haque, said. "Only the trial of BDR mutiny will be held at this court," he said at a press conference held at the BDR headquarters at Peelkhana in Dhaka. The bloody Feb 25-26 rebellion by the border guards at their headquarters and some other places left at least 73 people, 57 of them army officers. Mutinous soldiers hurriedly dumped the bodies of dozens of senior officers into shallow graves and sewers. According to the BDR Act, the BDR director general will chair the court and two others officers who are equal to lieutenant colonel and major general will also be there. A representative, nominated by the attorney general, will give legal assistance to the court. In addition, an accused can defend himself where he can take help from a BDR official or a lawyer. The trial of other mutiny suspects will be held under other special courts, Haque said. On Nov 15, the government formed six special courts, including two in Dhaka, to try some 3,500 border guards so far arrested. The special courts will only judge the mutiny cases, a BDR statement had said. Rangamati BDR headquarters commander Col Mohammad Siddiqur Rahman said the bench to try local suspects has been set up at their headquarters. Thirty-nine border guards have been so far arrested and accused in three separate BDR mutiny cases with Longdu, Baghaichharhi and Barkal Upazila in Rangamati district. All preparations have been completed to perform the trial smoothly, Rahman said. The accused will be placed before the court on Wednesday after the charges are read out on the first day, he added. BDR officials, who preferred not to be named, said the court will begin at 3pm and end at 6pm on Tuesday. Five BDR members of Rifles Battalion-12 at Rajnagag in Longdu Upzila will be put on trial on Wednesday Eighteen BDR members of 9 Rifles Battalion at Marishya in Baghaichhari Upazila, 16 others of 18 Rifles Battalion in Barkal Upzila will be later brought before the court.
