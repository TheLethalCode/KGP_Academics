 Dhaka, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com)Workers of three ready made garments factories, belonging to the BGMEA president, besieged the Dhaka-Aricha highway, claiming late payment of salaries and Eid allowances, and causing holiday traffic to mount on one of the major arteries out of the capital. The workers belonged to Envoy Fashions Ltd, Envoy Designs Ltd and Manta Apparel Ltd, all of the Envoy Group, ransacked the three factory premises, dragging out equipment including computers and furniture to set fire to them on the road, said witnesses. Hundreds of vehicles on both sides of the highway came to a halt, while riot police were forced to take position in front of all three factories. Police said workers continued their blockade for over five hours from 3pm. Two workers, Saiful Islam and Rabeya Begum, told bdnews24.com that the demonstrations began in the afternoon when workers heard they would not be paid as promised Thursday, the last business day ahead of Eid. However, BGMEA president Abdus Salam Murshedi, who owns Envoy Group, said the workers went on the rampage as they demanded a massive nine days Eid vacation and factory authorities refused. He said, "There is no salary or bonuses unpaid. We paid workers all dues last Tuesday." "They have destroyed my factories by looting, arson and vandalism." Demos and vandalism have become a regular incident in the garment sector ahead of major holidays. bdn
