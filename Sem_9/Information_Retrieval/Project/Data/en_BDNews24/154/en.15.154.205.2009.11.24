 Dhaka, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com)  The first BDR mutiny trial began on Tuesday in a special court at the border force's Rangamati district headquarters. State counsels Mosharraf Hossain Kajal and Monjurul Alam read out charges in court against five accused border guards. BDR director general Maj Gen Moinul Islam headed the special court bench, flanked by Lt Col Abdur Rouf and Major Mostafa Al Mamun. Proceedings began at 3pm and lasted just half an hour. The special court comprising three judges took the charges into cognisance and set Wednesday for the next hearing. It also ordered authorities to produce the five members of Rifles Battalion-12, of Rajnagag in Longdu Upazila, before the court at the next hearing. Deputy attorney general Sohrab Uddin, a representative nominated by the attorney general, was present at the court to provide legal assistance. The bloody Feb 25-26 mutiny at the border force's Dhaka headquarters killed over 70 people, 57 of them army officers deputed to the force. The rebellion also spread to other BDR posts around the country. On Nov 15, the government formed six special courts, including two in Dhaka, to try some 3,500 border guards accused in some 40 cases around the country. Rangamati BDR commander Col Mohammad Siddiqur Rahman said Special Court No 4 was set up at their headquarters to try the local mutiny suspects. Thirty-nine border guards have so far been arrested and accused in three separate mutiny cases in Longdu, Baghaichharhi and Barkal Upazilas of Rangamati district. Following the first five accused, of 12the Rifles Battalion, 18 members of 9th Rifles Battalion, from Baghaichhari Upazila, and 16 of 18th Rifles Battalion from Barkal Upazila, will be brought before the court. All the BDR arrestees are now detained in jails. The accused may choose a BDR lawyer or a civil lawyer for defence. bdnews2
