 Bagerhat, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com)  Eighteen young crocodiles have gone missing from a salt-water pool of Sundarban's Karamajal Wildlife Breeding Centre, worried officials said on Tuesday. Workers at the centre found the one-year-old crocs missing while changing the pool's water on Monday, Mihir Kumar Dey, divisional forest officer of the eastern Sundarban zone, told bdnews24.com. The centre had a total 133 salt water and three sweet water crocodiles aging from three months to five years held in various pools. Dey said some 61 crocodiles were washed away from the centre when Cyclone Aila hit in May. "But it is not possible for the crocodiles to get out of the pools normally." A General Diary complaint was filed by the centre's in-charge and crocodile specialist, Abdur Rob, at nearby Dakop Police Station. Assistant forest officer, Golam Kuddus Bhuiyan, was instructed to investigate the incident and submit a report within seven days, said Dey. bdnews24.c
