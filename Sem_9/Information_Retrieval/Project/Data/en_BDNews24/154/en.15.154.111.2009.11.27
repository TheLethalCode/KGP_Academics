 bdnews24.com New Delhi Correspondent New Delhi, Nov 27 (bdnews24.com)--Indian security forces have received intelligence inputs suggesting that the militants of the country's northeastern states are moving out of their "hideouts in Bangladesh". The intelligence agencies, however, are yet to ascertain if the militants leaving Bangladesh are sneaking into Myanmar, or crossing back over to India. "There are reports that some of the militants have crossed over from Bangladesh to India to avoid being caught by the security forces in the neighbouring country," said the director general of the Assam Rifles, Lt. Gen. K S Yadava. The Assam Rifles  originally raised as Cachar Levy by the British in 1835  is the oldest among the central paramilitary forces of India. It is now administered by the home ministry, but operates under the Indian Army. It guards the India-Myanmar border and combats insurgency in India's turbulent North-East. Lt. Gen. Yadava confirmed that Dhaka had of late turned the heat on Indian militants based in Bangladesh. "It is good that Bangladesh is cracking down on the anti-India elements. We only hope that the Bangladesh government continues to ensure that those who are functioning against the interests of our country are not given shelter there," he said. The security forces of India often allege that proscribed United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA), National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB), National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT) and several other militant outfits pursuing armed insurgency in some of the northeastern states of the country have bases and facilities for training in guerrilla warfare in Bangladesh. India's Border Security Force (BSF) earlier this month handed over to Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB), formerly Bangladesh Rifles, a list of around 90 camps of Indian insurgents in Bangladeshi territory. A BSF delegation led by its inspector general (Tripura Frontier) S K Mishra had a meeting with the BGB's deputy chief Brig. Gen. Mohammed Obaidul Haque in Sylhet in the first week of this month and requested the latter to dismantle the camps and flush out the militants. The Indian intelligence agencies believe that several top leaders of the ULFA, NDFB, NLFT and other outfits are also based in Dhaka and other Bangladeshi cities. Two top ULFA leaders  the outfit's 'finance secretary' Chitrabon Hazarika and 'foreign secretary' Shashadhar Choudhury  were spotted by the BSF soldiers near the India-Bangladesh border in northeastern Indian state of Tripura late at night on November 4. Choudhury and Hazarika were asked to surrender, when they were trying to cross over toIndian territory from Bangladesh. They surrendered and were taken into custody. They were later handed over to police in Assam. The ULFA in a statement e-mailed to the media-from an undisclosed location alleged that Hazarika and Choudhury had been picked up by some "unidentified armed men" from a house in Dhaka a few days back. Though the Bangladesh and India governments did not officially react to the ULFA's allegation, sources in the Indian foreign and home ministries said that the security agencies in both the countries had worked in close coordination "to create a situation" that led to their arrest by the BSF on the international border. India and Bangladesh do not have a bilateral extradition treaty at present. Sources, however, said that Delhi and Dhaka had reached a tacit understanding in accordance to which the Indian insurgent leaders hiding in Bangladesh would be "picked up and pushed back" to India, so that the Indian security forces could catch them. The ULFA general secretary Anup Chetia was arrested in Bangladesh in 1997 for illegally entering the country and staying there without valid documents. He was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment. Chetia was not handed over to India as there was no extradition treaty. Several other ULFA leaders, including its chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa and its military wing chief Paresh Barua, are also believed to be based in Dhaka and other Bangladeshi cities, although intelligence sources said that they kept on traveling to other South East Asian countries as well. In March 2008, Mohammed Hafijur Rehman and Din Mohammed, both prime accused in the Chittagong arms haul case, had confessed in the court that the 10 truck-loads of weapons and ammunition that were seized in 2004 had in fact been meant for the ULFA. Rehman also revealed that Barua, himself, had supervised the arms-smuggling operation. During foreign minister Dipu Moni's visit to New Delhi last September, India and Bangladesh had reiterated their resolve to strengthen bilateral co-operation to deter the recurrence of terrorist incidents. In a joint statement, both sides also reiterated their resolve not to allow the use of their territories for activities inimical to each other's security interests. Sources in the Indian foreign ministry said that the Bangladeshi security forces' recent crackdown on northeastern Indian militants based in the was perceived to be a goodwill gesture by Dhaka ahead of prime minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to De
