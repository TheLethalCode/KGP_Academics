 Dhaka, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com)  Some 2,500 RAB personnel will be deployed on Dhaka streets for extra Eid-ul-Azha security, said the Rapid Action Battalion chief on Tuesday. Around 7,000 will be deployed countrywide, including these, RAB director general, Khandaker Hasan Mahmud told reporters. The director general informed journalists at the meet that the RAB personnel will be mainly responsible for handling extortion and other crimes in cattle markets and cattle transport, and ensuring safety of people leaving the capital for Eid celebrations. Banks would be observed closely, he said. RAB personnel would also be working to stop criminal syndicates from initiating activities in the empty capital during Eid vacation, said Mahmud. To ensure this, uniformed RAB personnels and plain-clothed RAB detectives will be deployed at cattle markets, kitchen markets, shopping malls, go-downs, bus and launch terminals and critical locations on the highways. Members of RAB's strike forces would also be deployed, said the RAB chief. Regarding illegal cattle markets in the capital, he responded, "We will obviously take steps against illegal activities. If anyone establishes a cattle market illegally then steps will be taken." bd
