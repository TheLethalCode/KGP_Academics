The businessman, convicted on several counts of tax evasion and fraud, signed the affidavit of the petition. But, state lawyers said Monday, as he is on the run he has no right to sign any such legal document. The High Court Monday served a rule nisi asking authorities, including the finance secretary and DGFI director general, to explain why the money should not be returned. Justices Nazrul Islam Chowdhury and Mamun Rahman issued the rule on the petition that stated "the caretaker government" took Tk 40 crore and Tk 12 crore respectively on May 15 and May 22, 2007, from Meghna Cement.

Barrister Rafiqul Haque stood for the petitioner while deputy attorney general Nahid Mahtab and assistant general SM Moniruzzaman represented the state. b
