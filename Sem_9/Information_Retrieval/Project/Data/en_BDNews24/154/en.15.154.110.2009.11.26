<TITLE> Millions pray at Mt Arafat </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com)  Almost three million hajj pilgrims gathered to pray under a scorching sun at Mount Arafat in Saudi Arabia on Thursday, after braving rain and floods the day before, for the climax of the world's largest religious event. Throughout the day, the faithful climbed the Mountain of Mercy at Arafat, to pray for Allah's forgiveness in what Muslims consider the spiritual high point of the pilgrimage. Pilgrims dressed in white held umbrellas against the blazing sun following a day of deadly torrential rains. The rare thunderstorm and swine flu fears had threatened to hamper the start of the five-day hajj, required for all able Muslims at least once in their lifetime. Forty-eight people died in the port city of Jeddah, where most pilgrims arrive, following the heaviest rainfall in years, rescue workers said Thursday, but none were thought to be foreigners. Devotees from 180 countries, in flowing white robes, began the hajj rites on Wednesday, circling the Kaaba shrine inside Makkah's Grand Mosque. The next stage was the overnight stay at Mina before climbing Mount Arafat, a rocky desert some 20km outside the holy city of Makkah, one of the most important hajj rituals. Muslims believe God will hear their prayers if they are made within the sacred zone of Mount Arafat, the site of the Prophet Mohammad's last sermon in AD632. The pilgrims spent the whole day at Arafat in prayer, reciting the Quran and calling out the chant: "Here I am in answer to Thy call, Allah, here I am. There is no other God but Allah. Praise be unto Thee." On Wednesday afternoon, thousands of people began the arduous eight-kilometre (five-mile) trek to Mina through floodwaters, as others tried to go by bus, though rainwater blocked roads and vehicles stood immobile in long tailbacks. In a bid to avoid a repeat of previous crowd disasters, Saudi authorities this year completed the rebuilding of Jamarat Bridge in Mina the tragic scene of a stampede in 2006 in which 364 people were killed. Officials said the new 950m long, 80m wide five-storey pedestrian walkway, which cost $1.2bn, prevented overcrowding this year. Saudis authorities said there were about two million foreign pilgrims this year, as in other years. But the number of pilgrims from inside the kingdom, estimated at near one million last year, was expected to be sharply down because of swine flu fears. Few foreign pilgrims appeared concerned about the swine flu threat, however, despite the news that four pilgrims had died from the disease before the rites officially began. Health officials said that all four had already been suffering from other health problems, one from cancer and another from heart disease. A statement also said the four had not followed "recommended procedures, especially vaccination against swine flu"
