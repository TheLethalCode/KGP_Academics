 Dhaka, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com)--Former commerce minister Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury on Wednesday termed the absence of government representative at a recent meeting of the United States Senate as `most unpardonable`. In a statement, the former BNP MP said, "The powerful Ways and Means Committee of the United States Senate met recently in Washington DC where the important issue of duty free access for exports from the least developed countries like Bangladesh to the US was discussed. "Vice President of OXFAM spoke on that occasion where he had strongly advocated for such a preference programmed for these countries. "Unfortunately, there was no one from the Bangladesh government or from the Bangladesh Embassy in Washington present at the hearing," added the statement, delivered by BNP office secretary Ruhul Kabir Rizvi. Khasru said it was a reflection of the government's 'irresponsible manner' where the ministers, advisors and high commissioners did not care about the national interest. "Apparel export from Bangladesh forms overwhelmingly the lion's share of our total exports to the United States and getting duty free access to that vital market is of critical socio-economic importance for Bangladesh. "Such a serious lapse on, and such a cavalier attitude to an issue of such great national interest is a clear manifestation of a total lack of seriousness on the part of the government to protect the nation's interest. "This also reflects the government's total insensitivity to spending public funds to maintain a Ministry with no less than six persons enjoying the rank of Ministers or State Ministers, which itself is an unprecedented act anywhere in the world. The former minister also claimed the ambassador to USA lied that Bangladesh had been taken off from a "human rights watch list." The statement said, "This is an attempt by the Ambassador to cover up his blatant failure to protect the country's vital national interest in the United States." bdnews24.com has come to know that Bangladesh has indeed been dropped off the list but it will be 'observed' with other countries.
