<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court on Monday upheld the High Court's order to grill former state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar at the jail gate in connection with the Aug 21 2004 grenade attack case. A four-judge bench led by Mohammad Fazlul Karim gave the order by rejecting a leave to appeal petition by the government seeking to challenge the High Court order. Babar, already behind bars on an arms conviction, was named an accused in the Aug 21 case last month. On Oct 28, the High Court ordered the government and authorities concerned to grill Babar at the jail gate after his lawyers, on health grounds, protested a move to take him into remand for questioning in the case. The following day, the Supreme Court halted the order as the government submitted its leave to appeal, but did not give an immediate ruling. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam moved the leave to appeal petition. Senior advocate TH Khan and barrister Moudud Ahmed represented Babar, while barrister Mahbubuddin Khokon assisted them. Babar will have to be questioned at the jail gate in future too, Khokon said. bdn
