 Dhaka, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com)-Power outages in the cities and towns will deepen as the government will supply uninterrupted power to farmers from midnight to 6 in the morning during the Boro season from Feb-May next year. The farmers would be asked not to run their water pump in daytime except for emergencies, the prime minister's energy and mineral resources advisor, Tawfiq-e Elahi told journalists after a meeting at the energy ministry on Wednesday. "To ensure uninterrupted power supply to rural areas there will be increased power shortages in the cities. The city dwellers will suffer a bit. But they will have to bear it considering their rural brothers." However, if new sources for power are found, then the outages might decrease, he added. The Power Development Board chairman and high officials of related departments and organisations were present at the meeting.
