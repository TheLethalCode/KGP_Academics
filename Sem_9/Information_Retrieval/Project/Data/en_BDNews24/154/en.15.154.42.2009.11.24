 Dhaka, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com)The High Court ordered the government and Biman Bangladesh Airlines Tuesday to explain why plans to resume Biman's New York flights should not be halted. The bench of Justice Syed Refaat Ahmed and Justice Moinul Islam Chowdhury issued the rule nisi on a public interest petition filed by barrister Masud Reza Sobhan on Nov 4. The court ordered civil aviation and tourism secretary, Biman managing director Md Zakiul Islam and chairman Jamaluddin Ahmed to submit explanations within the next two weeks. The petitioner, Sobhan, said, "The Biman authorities plan to re-introduce the Dhaka-New York-Dhaka flight only for the uplift of our image abroad, in spite of the fact that it incurred heavy losses in the past." "Biman must be held responsible for incurring losses to the national exchequer of Tk 62.40 crore a year just to save the image of the government." Deputy attorney general Nazrul Islam Talukder represented the government at the hearing, opposing the petition. bdne
