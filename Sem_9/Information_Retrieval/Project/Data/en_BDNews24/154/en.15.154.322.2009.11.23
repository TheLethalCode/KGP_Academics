 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com)The standing committee on law is preparing legislation to give parliamentary bodies more teeth in their watchdog role over the government. It has drafted a law that would force any person, if summoned by parliamentary bodies, to appear before the committees. The new law would also authorise standing committees to compel officials to present any documents sought by the MPs. "We are filling a legislative vacuum of 37 years," said Suranjit Sengupta, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on law, on Monday. He said his committee had already prepared a draft of the bill. "If the bill is passed, legal proceedings will be taken against public servants flouting parliamentary summons," Sengupta told reporters after the committee meeting at the parliament building. "Besides, the bill will have provisions so that the standing committees can force the executive authorities to provide all necessary papers sought by the watchdog bodies," he said. "The ministry (law) is wholly in agreement with us for enacting the law," he added. The chairman said the framers of the constitution embodied Article 76 (3) to give standing committees power to force any persons of the executive to be physically present at the meetings and present necessary documents for accountability of the government. But public officials too often refuse to appear before the parliamentary bodies when summoned. Previous experience also shows that ministries very often refuse to hand over documents sought by the standing committees on pleas of 'sensitivity' or 'security'. The legislation to back the constitutional guidelines has never been passed. Sengupta said, "The draft bill will be finalised at our next meeting". "The new law will strengthen parliamentary democracy and make it more effective". Sengupta also said concerned parliamentary standing committees should discuss proposed laws before they are placed in parliament for improving the law making process. "But at present we, the standing committees, only discuss bills after they placed in parliament." "We have come to a consensus, however, on recommending to the government that standing committees discuss legislative proposals and the draft bills before they are placed in the House," he said.
