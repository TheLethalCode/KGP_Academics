 Dhaka, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com)Following chaos and eventual abandonment of party conferences in a number of districts ahead of BNP's national council, Sylhet, Narayanganj and Khulna chapters of the party are holding their pre-council meet on Wednesday. Though the conference in Khulna kicked off amid jubilations, in Narayanganj, the scenarios were the opposite. Two of the party factions here clashed with each other on the street in front of the assembly venue. In Sylhet, though two inimical groups convened the council, the important deliberations took place under the leadership of the more conspicuous group. bdnews24.com Narayanganj correspondent said, two contending groups took to the street in front of the meeting venue, Ali Ahmad Chuka Municipal Audirorium, at 11am and clashed with each other. The confronting parties vandalised a gateway erected for the purpose. Police later arrived at the spot, brought the situation under control and then the conference began. Moudud Ahmed addressed the assembly as the chief guest while advocate Taimur Alam Khandaker presided over the event. bdnews24.com Sylhet correspondent said, the conference began at 10:30am under the leadership of district BNP convenor M Ilias Ali at Chandipool in Dakshin Surma of the city. Goyeshwar Chandra Roy was present there as the chief guest. Though a rival group had also convened another council as a counter measure, nothing happened at their announced venue Wednesday morning. In Khulna, activists and leaders of the party from various city wards began assembling in the circuit house ground since morning amid ceremonies and the conference eventually kicked off at 12:35pm, though it had been initially scheduled for 10:30am.
