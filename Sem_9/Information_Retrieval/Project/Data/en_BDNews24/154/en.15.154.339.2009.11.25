<TEXT>
 Khulna, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com)--Alleged BDR mutineers of Khulna region will be put on trial in the first week of December. A Khulna BDR sector headquarters official, preferring not to be named, told bdnews24.com that the trial will be held at Nil Dumur of 7 Bangladesh Rifles Battalion in Satkhira. Some 600 border guards of 41 Rifles Battalion and 7 Rifles Battalion in Satkhira, 22 Rifles Battalion in Jessore and 23 Rifles Battalion in Khulna will face the trial. Of them, 155 mutiny suspects are in jail and all preparation for the trial is complete, said the official involved with the process. The trial of BDR mutiny suspects in Rangamati began on Nov 24. If allegations are proved, a border guard might have to stay maximum seven years in jail. At least 73 people, including 57 army officers deputed to the paramilitary force, were killed in the bloody Feb 25-26 mutiny at the Bangladesh Rifles' Peelkhana headquarters in Dhaka. Some BDR members from Khulna, Jessore and Satkhira, Sylhet, Chiittagong and other places expressed their solidarity with the mutineers in the city. The government on Sept 15 decided to try the mutineers under the BDR Act and those charged with killings and looting under the penal code by speedy trial tribunal. President Zillur Rahman sent a reference to the Supreme Court on Aug 17 seeking directives on the trial process, specifically whether the trial of the BDR mutineers could be held under the Army Act 1952. The court appointed 10 senior lawyers as amici curiae, literally 'friends of the court', to advise on the reference. The court began hearing their opinions on the reference on Aug 25 and ended on Sept 3. The majority of the amici curiae opined that trial of BDR personnel could not be held under the Army Act, 1952 even by notification. bdnews
