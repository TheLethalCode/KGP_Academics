 NEW DELHI Nov 23, (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  The Parliament was in uproar on Monday over a leaked government report blaming Hindu nationalist opposition leaders for their role in the destruction of an ancient mosque that sparked widespread riots. Angry lawmakers twice forced the adjournment of parliament and opposition leaders shouted "shame, shame" in the house, blaming the government for leaking the report. Mobs of Hindu hardliners tore down a 16-century mosque in Ayodhya in 1992, claiming it stood on the birthplace of their god-king Rama.

The Ayodhya mosque incident was blamed for further driving a wedge between the two communities and for the increasing radicalization of Muslims, who make up around 13 percent of the population. The report was submitted to the government in July. The government has said it would table the report in parliament in the current session. "I refrain to comment...on the contents," Home Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram told parliament over shouts from opposition lawmakers. He said the newspaper report was "unfortunate". Both Advani and Vajpayee have said the demolition was a spontaneous act and have denied they orchestrated the mobs. "If what is written is correct, the conclusions are false and ridiculous. There was no conspiracy, no planning. I myself have told the commission it was the saddest day of my life," Advani told parliament, holding up a copy of the newspa
