 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com)The law ministry has accepted a proposal for enacting a legislation which would force any person, if summoned by parliamentary standing committees, to appear before the MPs. "We are filling a legislative vacuum of 37 years," said Suranjit Sengupta, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on law, on Monday. He said his committee had already prepared a draft of the bill. "If the bill is passed, legal proceedings will be taken against public servants flouting parliamentary summons". It would also authorise the standing committee to compel the executive to present any documents sought by the body to play its watchdog role over the government, he told reporters after a committee meeting. "The ministry (law) is wholly in agreement with us for enacting a law, as per the Article 76 of the constitution, to force any person to appear before the parliamentary standing committees and ensure transparency and accountability of the executive," Sengupta told reporters after the committee meeting at parliament building. "Besides, the bill will have provisions so that the standing committees can force the executive authorities to provide all necessary papers sought by the watchdog bodies," he said. The chairman said the framers of the constitution embodied Article 76 (3) to give the standing committees power to force any persons of the executive to be physically present at the meetings and present necessary documents for accountability of the government. But the legislation to back the principle has never been passed. Sengupta said, "We have already formulated a draft of the bill. It will be finalised at our next meeting". "The new law will strengthen parliamentary democracy and make it more effective". The standing committee has recommended the government for enacting such law as public officials too often refuse to appear before the parliamentary bodies when summoned. Previous experience also shows that ministries very often refuse to hand over documents sought by the standing committees on pleas of 'sensitivity' or 'security'. Experts on parliamentary affairs say the government must enact a law in line with Article 76 to implement the constitutional guidelines on the watchdog bodies. Suranjit also said all the parliamentary standing committees should discuss all proposed laws before they are placed in parliament for improving the law making process. "But at present we, the standing committees, only discuss bills after they placed in parliament." "We have come to a consensus, however, on recommending to the government that standing committees discuss legislative proposals and the draft bills before they are placed in the House," he said.
