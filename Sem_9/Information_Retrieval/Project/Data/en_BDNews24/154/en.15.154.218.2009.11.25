 Dhaka, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com)--Laws to prevent repression of women are not properly applied in the country, the home minister said on Wednesday. "The government has formulated a stringent law to prevent women repression in the country," Sahara Khatun said at the inauguration of International Women Repression Prevention Fortnight running until Dec 10. "But, it is unfortunately true that we cannot specially apply this law. The reason behind this has to be searched out." The fortnight will be observed with a slogan 'Say NO--Unite to End Violence against Women'. Sahara also called on all men to come forward to properly apply laws for preventing such repression. A concerted effort of men and women can only uproot the women repression from the country, she said. However, she said, she know of many incidents where women framed men on false charges of repression. Sahara, herself a lawyer, said she had fought for women in many cases only to see them compromise halfway into the case. Dhaka University vice chancellor AAMS Arefin Siddique read out the ant-women repression pledge paper at the ceremony. Non-government organisation Step Towards Development organised the programme at Rabindra Sorobor of Dhanmandi in the city. bd
