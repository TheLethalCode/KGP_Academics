 Nov 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)--Heavy security patrols the streets of a southern Philippines town, after a massacre left at least 24 people abducted and brutally murdered. Heavy security contingents patrol the streets of this southern Philippines province, after a massacre that saw at least 24 people abducted and brutally murdered. Around 100 gunmen on Monday herded away 40 people, including members of the family of local Vice Mayor Esmael Mangudadatu, lawyers and local journalists. Twenty-four bodies were later found in a remote mountainous area with some beheaded and others mutilated. At least four people survived the massacre while 12 are still missing. Mangudadatu, whose wife and several other family members were among those killed, called on Philippine authorities to take action. "I am calling on the authorities - the military and the PNP personnel - to look onto the situation, the matter, because this is really an idiotic, barbaric and satanic behaviour." The southern Philippines is riven by clan rivalries, including one between the Mangudadatus and the Ampatuans. Military officials said the dead included the wife of Mangudadatu, who was on her way to file a nomination for her husband to contest the governorship of Maguindanao against Datu Andal Ampatuan, head of a powerful local family. The government has vowed to find those responsible.
