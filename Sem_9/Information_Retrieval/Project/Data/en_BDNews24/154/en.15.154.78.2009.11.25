 Dhaka, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com)--One in every six children in Bangladesh toils as a child labourer, while nearly 3.3 crore children are living under the poverty line. A UNICEF report unveiled on Wednesday at Hotel Sonargaon in the capital revealed these information. As much as 56 percent of the 6.3 crore children in the country lives under the poverty line, says the report titled 'National Report Bangladesh-2008: Global Study on Child Poverty and Disparities'. One in every four of them is deprived of their basic needs which include proper nutrition, education, healthcare and proper shelter. State minister for women and children affairs Shirin Sharmin Chowdhury unveiled the report. A Human Development Research Centre (HDRC) team led by its advisor, Abul Barakat, prepared the report with assistance of UNICEF. The state minister said combined effort is needed to eliminate poverty, rather than decrease it, . In current times, poverty has decreased, Sharmin mentioned. "Even though poverty has decreased in urban areas, no mentionable alleviation has occurred in the rural areas. Along with lifting children above the poverty line, ensuring their rights, food security, education, eradication of gender discrimination and lower death rates are necessary." "Steps to decrease poverty are needed in the budget along with more allocations for the children. This government has undertaken a combined approach to protect children from deprivation and discrimination." Information commissioner Azizur Rahman said, "Children under the poverty line face discrimination and deprivation the most. Most of the people in the country have no idea about how they live." He urged the United Nations to allocate more funds to save the children from illiteracy and malnutrition. Barakat, while presenting the report, said, "In Bangladesh 64 percent children lack sanitation facilities, 57 perdent lack nutritional supports, 52 percent are deprived of information, 41 percent do not have proper shelter, 16 percent do not get proper health care and 8 percent are deprived of the basic right of education." "One of every six children work as child labourers. The children face various deprivation, violence, torture and oppression at their residences, workplace, educational institutions and other places." The report emphasised the need for proper nutrition to eradicate poverty and discrimination and suggested that the government pay more attention to the issue. It also called for meaningful steps regarding child health, education and protection of their rights. Economic Relations Division secretary Mosharraf Hossain Bhuiyan, health secretary Sheikh Altaf Ali and UNICEF's representative in Bangladesh Carole D Roy also spoke at the programme. b
