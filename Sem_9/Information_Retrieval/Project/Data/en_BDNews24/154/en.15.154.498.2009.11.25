 Dhaka, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com)  Only one party, the Communist Party of Bangladesh, has so far fulfilled all the RPO conditions in its permanent constitution, an Election Commission official said Tuesday. Three parties, including the ruling Awami League, have been issued letters to revise parts of their recently ratified constitutions, EC joint secretary Nurul Islam Khan told bdnews24.com. "We are carefully scrutinising the party constitutions which have been submitted so far," said Khan, also convenor of the scrutiny committee. The EC formally thanked the Communist Party in a letter this week as its constitution is the first to fully meet the terms of the Representation of the People Order, he said. The permanent constitutions of four parties have been reviewed so far. Another 29 are still to be checked. Awami League, Jatiya Party and Liberal Democratic Party have been asked to bring some amendments, said Khan. "AL has mentioned two professional and one foreign organisation as associate bodies, which is out of line with the RPO. So they were asked for corrections," Khan said. He said the EC also asked JP and LDP to clarify their process of electing leaders from the grassroots and for ensuring representation of 33 percent women in the party, as these issues were not clear. Six parties including the main opposition BNP have yet to submit their amended constitutions. A total of 39 political parties were registered with draft constitutions ahead of the December 2008 elections. Of them, 33 parties completed their registration process by submitting their final constitutions to the EC by the July 24 deadline. The rest, including main opposition BNP, appealed to the EC for extension of time citing their inability to hold party councils and ratify their constitutions within the stipulated deadline. The cabinet on Sep 14 endorsed the EC's recommendation to increase the deadline from six to 12 months, up to Jan 24 2010. Parliament on Nov 2 also amended electoral law to include the provision that political parties will lose registration if they fail to submit their permanent constitutions to the EC by the new Jan 25 deadline. bdn
