 Dhaka, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com)-- Senior BNP leader Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury MP filed a writ petition to the High Court on Tuesday challenging the legality of barring him from going abroad . Chowdhury petitioned for a rule on the government asking it to explain why the restriction should not be declared illegal. The bench of justice Nazrul Islam Chowdhury and justice Mamnun Rahman heard the petition and set the time at 3pm to give a ruling on the plea. Shah Monjurul Haque, the lawyer for the BNP leader, said his client, who was to leave for Singapore on Monday for a medical check-up, was prevented from boarding an aircraft. Assistant attorney general S M Moniruzzaman opposed the petition. Immigration officials at Zia International Airport stopped the senior BNP leader from going abroad, saying he needed to secure a court's order to do so and that they were asked by the government not to let him go. Chowdhury faces charges of war crimes in cases filed across the country. b
