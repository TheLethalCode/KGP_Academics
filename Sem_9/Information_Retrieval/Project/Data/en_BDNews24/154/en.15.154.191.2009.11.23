<TEXT>
 KANPUR, India, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Injured Sri Lanka paceman bowler Dhammika Prasad will miss the second test against India starting on Tuesday but opener Tillekaratne Dilshan will play despite suffering a broken nose. Prasad, 26, picked up a hamstring strain on the final day of last week's high-scoring drawn first test in Ahmedabad and will not be considered for the second contest of a three-match series. Dilshan, who stroked a breezy 112, was injured after colliding with a team mate while playing soccer after the test. "Dilshan is fine, broken nose (but) perfectly fine," skipper Kumar Sangakkara said on Monday. "Dhammika has a grade one hamstring strain, and at this moment don't think he can play." Sri Lanka could include leg spinner Ajantha Mendis after the unorthodox bowler sat out the first test, where left-arm Rengana Herath partnered senior spinner Muttiah Muralitharan. Experienced paceman Dilhara Fernando, summoned as injury cover, could also play and a decision would be made after a final inspection of the Green Park pitch, Sangakkara told reporters. DHONI FIT Indian skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni was also passed fit after a finger injury forced team management to call up fellow wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik as cover. After seven batsmen stroked hundreds on a flat Ahmedabad pitch, both sides hoped the Green Park surface would aid bowlers. "There is a bit more grass, but it appears dry underneath," Sangakkara said. Dhoni added: "The weather is cool so the fast bowlers will get help in the mornings and at some point reverse swing will also come into action. The wicket will also break." Sri Lanka have not won any of their 15 tests in India since 1982, but held the early advantage in Ahmedabad after left-arm Chanaka Welegedara helped reduce India to 32-4 on the first morning. "We can't relax, we've got to keep challenging ourselves," Sangakkara said. He defended world record wicket taker Muralitharan, 37, whose form is a worry after failing to impress in the first test. "I don't see him as struggling. He is finding himself in a new way in the series," he said. "When you got a legend in your side you got to depend on him but there will always be expectations
