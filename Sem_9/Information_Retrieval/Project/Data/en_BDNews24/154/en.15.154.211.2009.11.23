 Chittagong, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com)--Workers of a jute mill in Sitakunda on Monday blocked the Dhaka-Chittagong highway for back pay, creating huge traffic clogs on both the sides of the highway. Over 2,000 workers of Kashem Jute Mills of Shitalpur area held a rally on the highway in front of the factory at around 11:30am. They lifted their barricade at midday and traffic became normal after 1:30pm, Sitakunda police chief Nazrul Islam told bdnews24.com. Sitakunda highway police sergeant Ameer Faruq told bdnews24.com the workers had not been getting their salaries for the last one year. They resorted to street agitation after previous peaceful movements failed to resolve their problem, he added. The government on Sunday urged garment factory owners to pay workers all arrears due up to October, and half month's salary for November and festival bonus before the Eid-ul-Azha. Any industry owner failing to comply with the directive would be legally dealt with, warned labour, expatriate welfare and overseas employment minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain. b
