<TITLE> Millions struggle through floods to Mt Arafat </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 26 (bdnews24.com)  Millions of hajj pilgrims gathered at Mount Arafat in Saudi Arabia from Thursday morning, braving rain and floods on the way, to mark the climax of the world's largest religious event. The rare thunderstorm and swine flu fears threatened to hamper the start of the five-day hajj, required for all able Muslims at least once in their lifetime, but Saudi officials said they were prepared for all eventualities. Pilgrims from all over the world, dressed in flowing white robes, began the hajj rites on Wednesday, circling the Kaaba shrine inside Makkah's Grand Mosque. The next stage was the overnight stay at Mina before climbing Mount Arafat, a rocky desert outside the holy city of Makkah, one of the most important hajj rituals. Muslims believe God will hear their prayers if they are made within the sacred zone of Mount Arafat, the site of the Prophet Mohammad's last sermon in AD632. On Wednesday afternoon, thousands of people began making their way through the rain on the eight-kilometre (five-mile) trek to Mina, as others tried to go by bus. But rainwater blocked roads and buses stood immobile in long tailbacks. Few foreigners appeared concerned about the swine flu threat, despite the news that four pilgrims had died from the disease before the rites officially began. Health officials said that all four had already been suffering from other health problems, one from cancer and another from heart disease. A statement also said the four had not followed "recommended procedures, especially vaccination against swine flu". Saudis authorities said there were about two million foreign pilgrims this year, as in other years. But the number of pilgrims from inside the kingdom, estimated at near one million last year, was expected to be sharply down because of swine flu fears. In a bid to avoid a repeat of previous crowd disasters, Saudi authorities completed the rebuilding of Jamarat Bridge in Mina the tragic scene of a stampede in 2006 in which 364 people were killed. Officials say the new 950m long, 80m wide five-storey pedestrian walkway, which cost $1.2bn, prevented overcrowding this year
