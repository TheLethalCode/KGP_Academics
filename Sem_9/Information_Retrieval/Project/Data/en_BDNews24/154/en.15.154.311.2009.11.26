 Chittagong, Nov 25 (bdnews24.com)--The Chittagong Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industries resumed operation on Wednesday after the High Court lifted a ban on Tuesday. The second trade body in the port city was launched on Jan 6 on approval of the commerce ministry. But the High Court imposed an indefinite ban on the organisation in March after its legality was challenged by the city's oldest traders' body, the Chittagong Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The HC bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Kamrul Islam Siddique quashed the petition on Tuesday after eight months into the filing of the petition. But after relaunch of CMCCI, the 100-year old CCCI has been divided. CMCCI has announced a 38-strong governing body headed by Chittagong Development Authority chairman businessman Abdus Salam, with KDS Group chairman Khalilur Rahman Chowdhury as the first vice president. Most of them were earlier with the CCCI. Other directors of the newly formed body are Mohibul Hassan Noufel, son of city mayor Mohiuddin Chowdhury, elder brother of former advisor Hossain Zillur Rahman Mohsin Zillul Karim, editor of Dainik Azadi M A Malek and Taslim Uddin Chowdhury, editor of Dainik Purbokon. CCCI clarifies At a news conference on Wednesday, the CCCI sought to clear things up. "We didn't want the division. We need to be united for the sake of Chittagong's residents," M A Salam, the senior vice president, said. "Two separate chambers can not function in a district." This is the reason why the petition was filed challenging the legality of CMCCI's caming into being, he added. However, he welcomed the CMCCI and said: "A different chamber would not create divisions among us." Replying to a question as to whether they treated the new body as their rival, Salam said, "Not at all. The CCCI is a 102-year old organisation whereas the metropolitan chamber is like a newborn. They'd need 75 more years to reach our level." He termed CCCI as the organisation that represents businesses of Chittagong, one that has played vital roles in different national issues including the reforms to port and customs automation. Some five to seven chamber members control the imports and marketing of four to five consumer products. This is why CCCI is not wary of the new organisation, Salam added. He also questioned how the chairman of a government-run organisation could head a trade body, alluding to the CDA chief being the chairman of the CMCCI. bd
