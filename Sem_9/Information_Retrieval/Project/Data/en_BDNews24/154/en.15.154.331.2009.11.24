 Dhaka, Nov 24 (bdnews24.com)--ADP progress will not be affected by the World Bank's objections to the new public procurement law, planning minister A K Khandaker said on Tuesday. "Sixteen percent of the Tk 30,500 crore Annual Development Programme has been allocated in the first four months, July-September, of the fiscal year," the minister told reporters after attending the ECNEC meeting chaired by prime minister Sheikh Hasina. Overall implementation was 10 percent during the period. "The rate of implementation at the start of the fiscal year is satisfactory." End of the year implementation will be better than any past year, the minister said. "The government is trying its best to inject pace in the implementation process. The planning ministry is organising meetings regularly with all the ministries. "The prime minister herself is also monitoring the matter," he added. Regarding the objections by the Bank, he said, "We will complete our own funded projects under the new procurement law, while decisions on the projects funded by the World Bank or other donor agencies will be made after discussion with them." It will not hamper ADP's progress, he added. Parliament passed an amendment to the Public Procurement Act (PPA) on Nov 4, amid concerns that it could be open to abuse and corruption by government/party supporters and compromise the quality of public works. The Bank objected to four specific provisions in the new PPAa lottery system, no qualification/experience requirements, rejection of bids above or below 5 percent of estimate, and single stage two-envelope system for procurement of goods and works. "The government of Bangladesh may continue its local procurement under the World Bank-financed projects so long as [the specified] provisions of the PPA amendment are not used," WB in a statement said Nov 12. Finance minister AMA Muhith said earlier this month the government will not change its newly amended PPA, but would follow World Bank guidelines on procurements as far as Bank-funded projects go. He said the seeming dispute between the government and lending agency over public procurement rules was "not such a serious issue". The recent amendments to the Public Procurement Act were made after discussions with the World Bank and other donors, Muhith said. bdn
