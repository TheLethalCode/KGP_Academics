<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov25 (bdnews24.com)The Gulistan-Jatrabari flyover project, cancelled by the 2007-08 caretaker regime, will resume in December, an official says. Chief engineer of Dhaka City Corporation Abdur Kader told reporters on Tuesday that the flyover will now extend from Palashi to Demra. "The Gulistan-Jatrabari flyover will now extend from Palashi to Demra, covering eight kilometres with 12 ramps instead of seven kilometres," he said after a meeting on the implementation of Demra-Jatrabari flyover construction project at Secretariat on Wednesday. Kadir said Dubai-based construction firm Belhasa Accom JV ltd, which started the project during the BNP-led coalition government's rule, will be awarded the project. Formulation of a new design is under way for implementing the project to meet the demand of time, he added. Asked if the new design will see any change, Kader said, "The length of the proposed fly-over will increase as per the new design." The work will resume soon after the new design is available, he said. WASA and PDB will have to replace some of their installations and connection in the different parts of the city to facilitate the implementation of the project, according to him. They will submit a report on their estimated losses to the local government ministry by Dec 20, he said, adding a case is pending with the court over the complexities of project implementation. Asked if project will resume in December with the case pending, he said,"I hope that the case will be disposed of soon paving the way for the project to resume." The meeting chaired by local government minister minister Syed Ashraful Islam was among others attended by secretary to local government Monjur Hasan and project director Ashikur Rahman. bdne
