 Mumbai, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police arrested a political leader in Mumbai on Wednesday for inciting violence after his party's workers attacked north Indians who migrated to the financial capital. Extra police officers and paramilitary forces were posted around the city before Raj Thackeray, head of the local party Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), was arrested. Police also arrested Abu Azmi, a local leader of the Samajwadi Party, which is based in Uttar Pradesh in northern India. He was released on bail soon after. He is accused of encouraging north Indians in Mumbai to retaliate. Television news channels said shops closed in parts of the city, either as a precaution or because they were forced to by party workers. There were also reports of workers throwing stones and damaging buses in Nasik in Maharashtra state, of which Mumbai is the capital. Police had been under pressure to arrest Thackeray since Sunday, when party workers attacked cinemas screening films in the north Indian language of Bhojpuri and beat up dozens of north Indians, including some of the many north Indian taxi drivers. Television pictures showed Thackeray wearing a blue sleeveless jumper over a white shirt, walking calmly towards a Mumbai court, surrounded by policemen. For generations, poor Indians have left behind rural poverty to try and make a living in Mumbai and other big cities. Millions hail from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, two of India's poorest states. Less than 50 percent of Mumbai's 17 million residents are Maharashtrians. MNS says it wants more jobs for what it calls the "sons of the soil" and greater respect from Mumbaikers whose roots lie elsewhere. The party said the recent violence was not ordered by the party, but was rather a spontaneous outburst of injured Maharashtrian pride. Thackeray formed the MNS in 2005 after splitting from a Hindu-nationalist party called Shiv Sena, which has recently moderated its earlier anti-immigrant stance.
