<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court has adjourned to March 9 the hearing on a government appeal against the High Court's cancellation of the ACC wealth statement notice on former prime minister Sheikh Hasina. A seven-member full bench of the Appellate Division headed by chief justice Md Ruhul Amin suspended the hearing Thursday after Hasina's counsel barrister Rafiq-ul Haque petitioned the court for more time. On the third day of proceedings, attorney general barrister Fida M Kamal said on behalf of the ACC that the High Court verdict declaring the ACC notice illegal was not a valid decision as the Anticorruption Commission asked Hasina to submit her wealth statement in accordance with the rules and regulations. However, Barrister Rafiq-ul, submitting the dictionary meanings of the terms 'investigation', 'enquiry', 'firm conviction' and 'satisfaction' to the court, argued that as per ACC rules the commission is required to investigate a suspect's wealth and means of earning before serving any notice on him/her only if any allegation is found to be substantive. Hasina's lawyer further said that the allegation against his client of "amassing ill-gotten wealth" could only be pressed against a government official. The ACC served the wealth statement notice on Hasina the day after her July 16 arrest and detention last year. The former prime minister filed a writ petition with the High Court on Aug 5 challenging the validity of the notice. The High Court stayed the efficacy of the notice two days later, asking the ACC to explain why the notice should not be declared illegal. On Nov 21, the High Court annulled the ACC notice declaring it illegal. The ACC filed a leave to appeal on Nov 25 with the Supreme Court challenging the verdict. The Appellate Division stayed the High Court verdict on Dec 3, and on Jan 10 accepted the ACC appeal. The Appellate Division, however, ordered the ACC not to move against Hasina on the basis of the wealth notice. bdnews24.
