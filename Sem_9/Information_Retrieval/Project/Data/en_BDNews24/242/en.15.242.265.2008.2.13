 Huston, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A pair of space shuttle astronauts left the International Space Station on Wednesday for a six-hour spacewalk to work on the outpost's cooling system, having already successfully brought Europe's first permanent space laboratory on line. It was the debut spacewalk for Germany's Hans Schlegel, 56, who was pulled from the mission's first outing due to an undisclosed medical condition, and the fourth for NASA's Rex Walheim, 45. The men floated outside the station's airlock at around 9:30 a.m. EST (1430 GMT). The spacewalkers are among the seven astronauts who flew aboard shuttle Atlantis last week to the space station to deliver Europe's first orbital research laboratory. The $1.9-billion Columbus module was installed during a spacewalk by Walheim and substitute Stanley Love, 42, on Monday and brought to life on Tuesday. Schlegel told reporters on Tuesday he agreed with the decision that canceled his spacewalk, saying "the bigger scheme is what's important." He declined to provide additional details about his condition, which prompted NASA to delay the first spacewalk from Sunday to Monday and extend Atlantis' stay at the outpost a day. "Medical issues are private," Schlegel told reporters during an inflight interview. "I feel really great now." Earlier in the week, Volker Sobick, the European Space Agency's deputy head of manned missions at the German Space Center, denied Schlegel had been ill. He said activities in space were like "a high performance sport" or a marathon, and that spacewalkers had to feel 100 percent fit. During Wednesday's spacewalk, Schlegel and Walheim plan to install a fresh tank of nitrogen which is needed to pump ammonia through the space station's cooling system. The spare 550 pound (250 kg) tank is in Atlantis' cargo bay. The astronauts will need to hook up electrical cables and hoses on the new tank, then anchor the spent container back in the shuttle for its return to Earth. With shuttle missions coming to an end in 2010, the new nitrogen tank will be refillable, as opposed to disposable. One more spacewalk is planned during Atlantis' visit. On Friday, Walheim and Love are scheduled to install two science experiments to the outside of the Columbus module. While Wednesday's spacewalk is under way, shuttle and space station crew members will resume working inside the new laboratory to set up experiment racks and equipment. "We are very pleased indeed to see crew finally inside the laboratory," said Alan Thirkettle, the European Space Agency's station program manager.
