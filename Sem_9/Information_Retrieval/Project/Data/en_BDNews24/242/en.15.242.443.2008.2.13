 Rome, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Italian soldier serving in Afghanistan was killed and another was wounded on Wednesday when gunmen opened fire on them, the Defence Ministry said. A ministry statement said the shooting took place some 60 km (40 miles) from the Afghan capital Kabul. It said the Italian soldiers returned the fire. Italy has some 2,200 Italian troops in Afghanistan as part of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). Italy is among several NATO nations that have been hesitant to send soldiers to the restive southern and eastern areas where the insurgents are most active and clash regularly with foreign troops under NATO and U.S. military command. More than 330 foreign soldiers have been killed in the past two years, the bloodiest period since U.S.-led troops overthrew the Taliban government in 2001. The United States, which forms the bulk of the foreign force in Afghanistan, has been pushing alliance members to take more responsibility in the war against the al Qaeda-backed Taliban.
