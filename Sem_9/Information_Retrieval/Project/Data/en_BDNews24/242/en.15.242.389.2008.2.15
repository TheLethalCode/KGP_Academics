Anderson also called on fashion designers and consumers to boycott pelts and seal products, which Canada defend as a traditional source of trade that helps balance the ecosystem. "The hunt was dead for 20 years, and has been revived not to honor local customs or conserve cod stocks but because new markets for fur have opened up in Russia and China," she said.
