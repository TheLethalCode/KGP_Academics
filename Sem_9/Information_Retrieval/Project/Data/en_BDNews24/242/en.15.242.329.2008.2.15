<TEXT>
 SYDNEY, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Adam Gilchrist hit a century in his final hometown appearance in Perth to lead Australia to a 63-run victory over Sri Lanka in Friday's tri-series match. Gilchrist bowed out at the WACA with 118, scoring half of Australia's all-out total of 236. It was his first one-day hundred since he made a breathtaking ton against Sri Lanka in last year's World Cup final in Barbados. Sri Lanka replied with 173 despite a defiant 80 from their own wicketkeeper-batsman Kumar Sangakkara, handing the hosts a bonus point for their big winning margin. The victory lifted Australia to the top of the table with 12 points from four games. India are second with eight points while Sri Lanka have six at the halfway stage of the competition. Gilchrist, who retires from international cricket after the tri-series, was determined to make an impression in his last match at the WACA. With his family among a full-house in attendance, Gilchrist tore into the bowling to smash nine fours and three sixes. "It turned out to be the perfect day," he told reporters. "I must admit today was where it really hit me that it is all finishing. "Today was always going to be a big day. I am glad it is done and thrilled with the way it has gone." SCORING RATE He brought up his 16th one-day international hundred off 117 balls before falling to Lasith Malinga while trying to increase the scoring rate. Gilchrist's departure triggered a collapse as Australia lost their last six wickets for 30 runs. Michael Clarke made 43 and Ricky Ponting and Mike Hussey chipped in with 25 apiece. Paceman Malinga took four for 47 while Nuwan Kulasekera claimed two wickets. Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene said Gilchrist's century proved decisive. "That was the wicket we wanted early but we could not get it," he said. "He is not taking many risks up front and he is being very patient. "He did the same in Sydney as well and the way he batted today was brilliant." Sri Lanka made a flying start to their reply, piling up 71 runs in 11 overs but also losing openers Sanath Jayasuriya (12) and Tillakaratne Dilshan (11) and Jayawardene (21). Sangakkara played a lone hand as he steadily ran out of partners before he was the last man out. The teams travel to Adelaide next to play India, with Australia in action on Sunday and Sri Lanka playing two days late
