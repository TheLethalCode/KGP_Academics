<TITLE> Bangladeshi American is first Muslim chaplain in US Marine Corps </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com) A Bangladeshi-born American has become the first Muslim chaplain in the US Marine Corps, said the US embassy in Dhaka Wednesday. He will counsel military personnel of all faiths, said a statement released by the embassy. Abuhena Saifulislam went to the US in 1989 and received residency rights through the governmental immigration lottery. The 45 year-old now counsels fellow marines before going to battle and attempts to foster understanding between Muslims and non-Muslims. When he counsels soldiers who are torn between their religious convictions, on the one hand, and going to war and possibly killing people, on the other, it does not matter whether they are Muslim, according to the chaplain. "I counsel service members before they go to battle, and the majority of them are non-Muslims. I counsel equally, in the same fashion," he said. Abuhena joined the US Navy in September 1992 after receiving a master's degree in business administration from the University of New Hampshire. He embarked on his quest to become a Muslim military chaplain, after gaining US citizenship in 1995. "When I found out they were looking for Muslim chaplains, I wanted to become one," he said. "I was already involved in religious activities inside the Pentagon, establishing Friday services and other such things." "Ninety-nine percent of the people who come to see me for counselling are not Muslim," he said. The US intention in Iraq and Afghanistan is to rebuild those countries, he tells service people. "If they are Muslim, I give them the perspective that they can be part of the rebuilding or they can help their comrades understand Muslim culture and Islam," Abuhena said. "I ask them, 'Do you think that you can contribute?' Then they make the decision." Abuhena also tries to teach Muslims and non-Muslims to understand one another better: "It's a two-way process. One is to let one group know that although there are some extremist Muslims, who happen to be criminals in my opinion, that is not Islam." The chaplain said that in his efforts to teach in the opposite direction, he responds to questions from Muslims about the actions of the US military. "In the Muslim community, there are some groups that associate me with Abu Ghraib," he said of the US military prison in Iraq where US troops abused and humiliated Iraqi prisoners. I tell them that it is an isolated incident. I know how we train our troops.  There are isolated incidents, but they are not policy," he said. The chaplain said the same applies to acts of discrimination against Muslims that take place within the US military: "There is prejudice as part of human nature, but it is not condoned or accepted. If it is known, we take action." Speaking of other areas of counselling, Abuhena said: "When it comes to personal relationships, marriage, drugs, alcohol, stress or financial problems religion doesn't play a role." "We provide support." Abuhena was the first student enrolled in a programme set up in 1996 to train Muslim military chaplains by the Defense Department and the Graduate School of Islamic and Social Sciences in Leesburg, Virginia. bdnews
