 Mustak Ahmed bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com)  The University Grants Commission in its annual report came down hard on private universities, saying students were being enrolled beyond their accommodation capacity and the qualification of students was not verified, as tuition fees were the main source of income. Contacted by bdnews24.com, UGC chairman Prof Md Nazrul Islam said most of the private universities do not care for qualification of students or enrollment capacity resulting in deteriorating quality of education. Islam said there were some exceptions, adding that the commission would monitor the situation. In its report, submitted to the president recently, UGC highlighted the widely varying tuition fees and salaries in the universities. It also alleged that private universities enroll additional students without considering their merit, as their main source of income was tuition fees. Referring to the huge differences in salaries and tuition fees of private universities, Islam said there would be provisions in a proposed private university act featuring rules and regulations on the matter. Abul Quashem Haider, president of the Association of Private Universities, told bdnews24.com that they would welcome any move to identify those universities that did not abide by the rules for enrolling students and take action against them. He also supported any move towards a regulatory law for private universities. But, Haider stressed, the UGC had to stop its stereotyped allegations against private universities. The UGC report recommended formulating clear rules and regulations for admission, tuition fees and salaries, proposing that fees and charges be kept at such a level that private university education be affordable and open for poor but meritorious students. bdnews
