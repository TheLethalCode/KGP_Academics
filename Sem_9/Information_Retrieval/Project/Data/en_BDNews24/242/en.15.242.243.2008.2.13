 Manila, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A former political ally of Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo said on Wednesday he was working with opposition leaders to field a common candidate for the 2010 presidential election. Jose de Venecia, who was removed as speaker of the lower house of Congress last week, said he had held talks with deposed president Joseph Estrada to find a strong leader like Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew to rid the country of widespread corruption. De Venecia blamed Arroyo's two sons for his ouster after his own son named Arroyo's husband in a Senate inquiry late last year into corruption allegations in a state deal with Chinese telecoms firm ZTE Corp. Arroyo later scrapped the broadband network deal but the scandal resurfaced last week when a new witness surfaced to corroborate allegations that the deal was overpriced by $130 million to fund kickbacks. The government has denied the graft allegations. "We discussed how we will fight corruption in government," de Venecia told a radio interview on Thursday, adding he had lengthy talks with Estrada on how to pick a candidate for 2010. Estrada, who was ousted from office in 2001, was convicted last year of plunder and sentenced to life in prison. Arroyo, who was propelled into power by his ouster, later pardoned him and freed him from detention. Interviewed hours before he was expected to deliver a speech in Congress, De Venecia said the Philippines needed a strong moral leader, like Singapore's Lee, who could end corruption in government, judiciary, the legislature and the election system. "Votes are being bought all over the Philippines," de Venecia said, but stop short of repeating the opposition's claim that Arroyo rigged the 2004 election to remain in power until 2010. Arroyo has denied any wrongdoing in the poll but most Filipinos continue to distrust her. Vice President Noli de Castro and three of Arroyo's hardest critics in the Senate are the early front-runners in the 2010 presidential election, a survey by independent pollster Social Weather Stations said on Wednesday. De Castro led the pack with 30 percent followed by Senate President Manuel Villar with 27 percent and Senators Loren Legarda and Manuel Roxas with 23 percent and 20 percent, respectively. Arroyo is not eligible to run again after term ends in 2010.
