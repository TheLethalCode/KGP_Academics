 LONDON, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares rose 0.7 percent in early trade on Thursday, tracking economic data-driven gains in the United States and Asia, as investors digested broadly stronger results from Europe's top companies. At 0917 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of European bluechips was up 0.7 percent at 1,343.79 points, with commodity stocks among the top weighted gainers. Oil shares also rose, tracking higher crude prices. Platinum specialist Lonmin jumped 3.2 percent as prices of the metal hit a new record, and Anglo American gained 2.2 percent on a newspaper report suggesting that Rio Tinto could bid for the group. Rio declined comment. French computer consultancy Cap Gemini and Sweden's Swedbank jumped more than 7 percent, and French cement maker Lafarge and food group Danone both gained around 4 percent, all on strong results. "The results from Europe have been good, but like 2003, we are in an inflection year, and in an inflection year, one needs to look forward and trailing earnings are meaningless," said Ad van Tiggelen, senior strategist at ING Investment Management in Amsterdam. "We are in a bear market and this is a bear market rally." Swiss bank UBS fell 6 percent after it said it expected 2008 to be a tough year and unveiled $26.6 billion in new exposure to risky U.S. mortgages. German automaker Daimler gave up gains to trade lower after an initial sharp rise on a higher proposed dividend and bullish outlook. U.S. stocks rose overnight on a surprise gain in January retail sales, while Japanese shares were up 4.3 percent after data showed the economy grew twice as fast as expected in the final quarter of 2007. U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson were due to testify on the state of the U.S. economy and financial markets before the Senate Banking Committee at 1500 GMT. Paulson is expected to tell Congress that the United States is experiencing a "significant" housing market downturn but the economy is fundamentally sound and should avoid recession. MINI-RALLY European shares have rallied 10 percent since hitting a low for the year on Jan. 22, helped by two U.S. rate cuts that lopped 125 basis points off the Fed funds rate. At its lowest point this year, the FTSEurofirst 300 was 25 percent off a multi-year peak hit in July 2007. Analysts consider a fall of 20 percent from such a peak as signalling a bear market. Banks were worst hit by a credit crisis stemming from a meltdown in the U.S. subprime mortgage sector last year, and have been among the top losers again this year. The DJ Stoxx European banking index has lost 15.5 percent so far in 2008, matching losses in autos and insurers. Van Tiggelen said that he expected financials to lead the markets higher as the months passed. "The first thing to be buying is the financials," he said. "On cyclicals, the bad news is yet to start," he added, saying that he expected European company earnings to decline 5-10 percent this ye
