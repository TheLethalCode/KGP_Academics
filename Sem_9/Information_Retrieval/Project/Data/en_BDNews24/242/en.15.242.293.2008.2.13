 Beijing, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China will seek to head off any riots or protests that could mar its showcase Olympics Game year through secret investigations and punishment of errant officials, state media reported on Wednesday. China's Communist Party leaders have been alarmed by growing petitions, protests and mass petitions in past years, worries that have intensified in the run-up to the Beijing Olympics, which open in August. The Party's Central Committee for Comprehensive Management of Public Security has announced steps to stifle sources of unrest. Hotspots of instability would attract secret probes, surveys and joint investigations, the China Police Daily reported. "Intensify the focus on areas where there have been major problems with grave threats to social stability, enforce the investigation responsible leaders," it urged, adding that officials could be punished for even one outbreak of unrest. The rules urge officials from different -- and sometimes rival -- agencies to share more information and efforts to combat unrest. Promotions, bonuses and fines would be linked to performance in ensuring public security, the paper said. Even as China's economy has boomed, protests by disgruntled citizens have also grown. Official figures show the number of "mass incidents" reached 23,000 in 2006, compared to 10,000 in 1994, largely driven by farmers' complaints about lost land and corruption. Officials have not released more recent numbers but have said such protests have been falling as the government diverts more spending to poor areas and cracks down on crooked land deals
