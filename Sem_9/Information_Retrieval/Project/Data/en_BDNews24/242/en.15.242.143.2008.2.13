 GENEVA, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia welcomed on Wednesday the release of a World Trade Organisation (WTO) text on negotiations in services, saying it provided a solid foundation for a full proposal on the sector. Trade Minister Simon Crean said Australia could not support a deal in the Doha round to open up world trade without an ambitious result in services, such as banking and telecoms. "Our starting point must be locking in most of the market openness that is currently available to Australian services exporters, but we also need to build new market access in international markets and sectors," he said in a statement distributed by Australia's WTO mission. Australia, along with other countries such as the United States, European Union, Japan, Switzerland, Hong Kong and India, has been keen to ensure that the current Doha negotiations did not focus on the core areas of agriculture and industry to the exclusion of services. Crean said he had contacted EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and US Trade Representative Susan Schwab in the past 24 hours to discuss how to get a result in negotiations in services that would match outcomes in farming and industry. The services text, issued on Tuesday, and revised drafts on agriculture and industry released last week, are intended to pave the way for a meeting of trade ministers in March or April to agree an outline deal on opening up world trade. While the farm and industry negotiations will come down largely to agreeing cuts in subsidies and tariffs, and the exceptions to them, the talks on services are more complicated and cannot be reduced to a simple formula. Around 30 countries interested in liberalising services will make offers to each other on a bilateral basis, and then in small groups. This requires detailed preparation, and led some countries and trade officials to argue that the ministerial meeting in March or April should not be overloaded with negotiations on services. But the countries seeking more liberalisation in services believe they cannot sell a deal back home entailing cuts in tariffs or subsidies if they cannot point at the same time to big gains for their services sectors. Crean said he was working to have an early "signalling exercise" where ministers would signal their readiness to open up services in different areas, even if the specific measures came only later. Trade diplomats said that would probably take place at the same time as the proposed ministerial meeti
