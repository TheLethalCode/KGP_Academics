 WAGAH, Pakistan, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani labourers on the border with India unloaded tomatoes on Wednesday, the fruit of a tentative peace process between the old rivals that looks set to be sustained no matter who wins Pakistan's elections. Nuclear-armed Pakistan and India have fought three wars since 1947 and nearly went to war again in 2002 but a peace process launched in early 2004 ushered in a period of calm. But after months of political turmoil in Pakistan that began when President Pervez Musharraf tried to dismiss the country's top judge last March, relations with India have hardly figured in the campaign for parliamentary elections on Feb 18. In Wagah, the main crossing point on the border, dozens of porters in red shirts unloaded crates of tomatoes from Indian trucks that crossed over into a dusty staging area just inside Pakistan. Trade between the old rivals is still restricted, and while it is a trickle of what it could be it still represents a marked improvement in ties. "Just 30 to 35 trucks come a day and not everyone gets work. Some of us go home empty handed in the evening," said labourer Mohammad Arshad. "We pray for better relations. That would mean more work." The elections for a new parliament and assemblies in Pakistan's provinces is seen as a three-way race between the pro-Musharraf Pakistan Muslim League, which has ruled under him, and the opposition parties of former prime ministers Nawaz Sharif and the assassinated Benazir Bhutto. All the major parties say they want to sustain the peace process that has brought better transport links and an improvement in diplomatic, cultural and sporting ties, as well as the modest increase in trade. But the peace process has brought no progress on the core dispute over the divided Muslim-majority Himalayan region of Kashmir. "DEMOCRACY A MUST" Kashmir has been a highly emotive issue in Pakistan since independence. Pakistan has for years supported separatist rebels in Indian Kashmir, where Pakistan says the Muslim population is being oppressed by the Indian army. But even Kashmir has hardly been mentioned in the election campaign. "Relations with India were a very important factor in politics but after the crisis over the dismissal of the chief justice all the attention of policy makers, the government, the public turned towards internal problems," said Umbreen Javaid, a political science professor at Punjab University in Lahore. "It's not a discussion point," she said. "All parties believe Pakistan should have better relations with India. Any of the three major parties that could come into power would like to pursue the peace process." Punjab University South Asia studies professor Jahangir Tamimi said relations with India had traditionally been the domain of Pakistan's military-bureaucratic establishment. "It's basically an establishment problem. The political parties have very little option to move forward," Tamimi said. Greater democracy and more representative government was essential for improving ties with India in line with the wishes of most of the people, he said. "The democratic process is a must. If public opinion is there it will provide the opportunity to create an atmosphere to deal with the chronic issues such as Kashmir." Back at Wagah, Khalil Ahmad, who runs a book stall in a small market metres from the border, said he had no interest in the election but he too longed for peace with India. "If there's war, both countries will be finished," he sa
