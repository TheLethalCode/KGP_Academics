<TEXT>
 LONDON, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British insurer Standard Life has reinsured 6.7 billion pounds ($13.1 billion) of its annuity liabilities, it said on Thursday, slashing its exposure to the risk of Britons living longer and boosting 2008 profit. Shares in the Edinburgh-based life insurer, previously the UK insurer with the largest exposure to longevity risk, were up 3.1 percent at 213.75 pence at 0900 GMT, having earlier touched 216p. The deal with Canada Life International Re, a unit of Great-West Lifeco, is the biggest of its kind in Britain to date and covers more than half Standard Life's total annuity liabilities of around 12 billion pounds. The move, which will see Standard Life transfer both the liabilities and the corresponding assets to Canada Life, is expected to boost the insurer's embedded value operating profit by at least 100 million pounds this year. It should also allow Standard Life to release cash from its reserves in 2008 -- which it said would be around the same "order of magnitude" as the 100 million pound increase to profit -- and to reduce the amount of capital regulators require it to hold. "The announcement that Standard Life is to reinsure more than half of its annuity book to Canada Life Re is extremely good news, in our view," Panmure analysts said in a morning note. "It significantly reduces the mortality risk and sensitivity to mortality assumption changes going forward." At the end of 2006, the sensitivity of Standard Life's embedded value -- a measure of worth for insurers -- to a 5 percent strengthening of mortality assumptions was 94 million pounds. After the deal, that drops to 55 million pounds. Standard Life said it would use the capital freed up through the deal, effective from Thursday, to "take advantage of the profitable opportunities available to us." The deal relates to individual life annuities written just prior to the insurer's demutualisation in 2006. These policies left shareholders bearing the brunt of the longevity risk, but without a share in the investment upside. Newer annuity business, still mostly from existing pension policyholders taking out annuities, leaves shareholders with longevity risk but they also benefit from investment margins. A Standard Life spokesman said there were currently no plans to seek deals for the remainder and newer portion of its annuity book, but said the option could not be ruled out. Standard Life is due to report full-year results next mon
