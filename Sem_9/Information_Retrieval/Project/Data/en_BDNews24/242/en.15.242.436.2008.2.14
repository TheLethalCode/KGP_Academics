 Analysis Atul Prakash LONDON, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Anyone who thought platinum prices couldn't go higher after spiking 60 percent in six months got a rude shock on Thursday when the metal hit $2,025 an ounce. Analysts say that even at this record level -- up 32 percent in three weeks and double the price of two years ago -- platinum is a good opportunity as strong fundamentals and a power crisis in top producer South Africa will rule for months to come. "Right now the ball is in the bulls' court and they can run with it and that's what they are doing. They can continue driving prices until this whole move runs out of steam," David Holmes, director of metals sales at Dresdner Kleinwort, said. Spot platinum surged to a record high for the 11th straight day, rising as high as $2,025 an ounce on Thursday from its close of $1,985/1,995 in New York late on Wednesday. An acute power crisis in top producer South Africa, which accounts for 80 percent of platinum's global supply, has been hitting production, while nearly two-thirds of the metal demand is highly price inelastic and continuously growing. Strong prices also attracted investors into exchange traded funds (ETFs), taking away significant volumes from the supply chain and tightening a market that is already squeezed. The global market deficit is expected to widen to 400,000-to-500,000 ounces by the end of 2008, from 265,000 in 2007, mainly on account of output losses in South Africa. The forecast does not factor in mining disruptions that may occur the rest of the year due to accidents and safety-related mining halts in South Africa, hit by many this year and last. "This is a supply shock of mammoth proportions. We never saw anything like this before," said Stephen Briggs, economist at SG Corporate and Investment Banking. PERSISTENT POWER PROBLEMS In 2007 total global platinum demand of 6.925 million ounces surpassed supply of 6.660 million. The market had a surplus of 65,000 ounces in 2006 after seven successive years of deficits. South African power utility Eskom, which supplies almost all of the electricity to the country, cut power to mines last month. Households were left in the dark and shops were forced to close. Mines are now getting 90 percent of the normal supply. Eskom's Chief Executive Officer Jacob Maroga said on Thursday the company will consider buying back "significant" amounts of power from industrial customers. At the height of the power crisis, mines were shut for five days. Authorities say the crisis may last for four months, and supply troubles will linger for five years. "Electricity is a problem in South Africa and it's going to stay like that for years to come. The situation is going to get complicated further as we are going to go into the winter, which will definitely see more electricity consumption." Standard Bank precious metals analyst Walter De Wet said. Impala Platinum, the world's second biggest producer, said its output in the year to end-June would fall to just under 2 million ounces from 2.026 million in 2007. Anglo Platinum, the world's top producer, said power problem alone would cut output by 120,000 ounces in 2008, and had cost 30,000 ounces since January. Last month's flooding at its second-largest mine would cut a further 60,000 ounces. Last year, Angloplat launched a safety campaign, which shut its operations temporarily. Authorities also ordered temporary shutdowns every time a worker was killed at South African mines, in a year when a total of 25 workers died at Angloplat's mines. Production at Northam fell 16.5 percent to 150,755 ounces in the first half to December due to accident-related stoppages which led to production losses for 23 days. "You know that platinum demand is increasing on the back of emission controls and you know that supplies are going to be squeezed. So it just makes sense to be long in this market," Standard Bank's De Wet said. DEMAND SURGE Platinum use in autocatalysts has soared 135 percent in nearly a decade to 4.24 million ounces in 2007, mainly due to stringent emission norms and growing vehicle production. Platinum held by ETF Securities doubled to 270,000 ounces this week from the end of 2007. But global jewelry demand fell 1.5 percent to 1.595 million ounces in 2007 from a year earlier. "In the end, what you need is higher supply and you need that urgently. But that just doesn't seem to be coming through at the moment," said Michael Widmer, analyst at Lehman Brothers. "Relying purely on lower demand is not the way to go. You need the producers to produce more to rebalance the market."
