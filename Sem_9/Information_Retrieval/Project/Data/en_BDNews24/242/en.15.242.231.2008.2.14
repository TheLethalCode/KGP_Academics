<TITLE> Rights group: no amnesty for Kenya crisis culprits </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NAIROBI, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A truth, justice and reconciliation commission planned to help heal wounds left by Kenya's crisis should not grant amnesty to those behind the worst killings, a local rights group said on Thursday. Former UN chief Kofi Annan is leading talks to end turmoil triggered by President Mwai Kibaki's disputed Dec. 27 re-election that has killed at least 1,000 people and uprooted 300,000 more, shattering the country's peaceful image. Opposition leader Raila Odinga accuses Kibaki's team of rigging the vote. Both sides have agreed in principle to some form of power-sharing and are now focusing on the details behind closed doors at a safari lodge, sources close to the discussions say. They may also set up a South African-style truth commission to investigate widespread rights abuses including ethnic attacks and the killing of protesters by police. Applauding moves to investigate the bloodshed, the government-funded Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR) said ringleaders should not be forgiven. "The worst perpetrators and planners of the types of violations that have taken place over the recent weeks must never be exempted," KNCHR commissioner Hassan Omar Hassan told a news conference. "To do so would be a travesty of justice." The group's call added to international pressure for the perpetrators of violence to be held accountable. Various Western nations have threatened travel bans or freezing of assets against guilty parties, and have also said that anyone derailing the Annan talks will face "consequences". Kenya's crisis has shocked locals, neighbouring states and world powers alike, crippling its tourism industry and denting one of Africa's most promising economies. Any truth commission must study past crimes, Hassan said, including grand corruption and bad governance. He accused authorities of ignoring signs of growing inter-ethnic tensions. "We have lived in collective denial that there were serious structural fault lines in Kenya's make-up," he said. "This facade of national unity has regrettably been laid bare resulting in gross violations of human rights." The trouble has exposed deep rifts over land, power and wealth that date from the British colonial era and have been stoked by some Kenyan politicians ever since. The talks are supposed to address those longer-standing issues in the next year, but Annan has said he hopes for an immediate political solution within days. Both sides say that will take the form of a power-sharing deal, but the details are far from clear. Government officials have said they will only share power in the form of cabinet appointments to be made by Kibaki himse
