 Dhaka, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com)Shakib Al Hasan will captain the Bangladesh Cricket Board XI in a three-day warm up match against a visiting South African team. The match will start Sunday at the Narayanganj Osmani Stadium, ahead of two Tests between the nations, beginning on Feb 22 at the Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Opener Tamim Iqbal was drafted into the warm up squad at the last moment, although his appearance is subject to a fitness test, said a BCB press release Friday. BCB media manager Rabeed Imam said Tamim was withheld from Friday's practice in accordance with his doctor's advice. The left-handed opener sustained an injury to his left thumb during Bangladesh's tour of New Zealand two months ago. Tamim's bandages were removed Thursday, after which he practiced for a short time. National coach Jamie Siddons will guide the warm-up squad. The warm-up squad includes Shakib Al Hasan (captain), Tamim Iqbal, Zunaed Siddique, Shahriar Nafees, Nazim Uddin, Rajin Salah, Aftab Ahmed, Mushfiqur Rahim (vice captain), Enamul Haque Jr, Sajedul Islam, Talha Jubaer, Farhad Reza, Syed Rasel, Roqibul Hassan and Habibul Bashar. bd
