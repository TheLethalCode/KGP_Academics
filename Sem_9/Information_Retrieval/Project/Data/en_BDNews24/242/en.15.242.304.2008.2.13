<TITLE> Myanmar gives top dissident another year in jail </TITLE>

 Yangon, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Myanmar's junta gave prominent opposition politician Tin Oo another year in jail on Wednesday, dashing hopes of a relaxation of restrictions on dissidents before May's referendum, a home ministry source said. Tin Oo, number two to detained opposition leader and Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, has been under house since May 2003, when their convoy was attacked by pro-junta militiamen in a provincial town. The extension of his detention was read out to Tin Oo by a junta official who visited his house, the government source said. Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) won an election landslide in 1990, only to be denied power by the former Burma's ruling military. She has spent most of the interim in prison or under house arrest. The junta surprised the NLD this week, announcing a referendum on a new, as yet unfinished, constitution in May to be followed by a general election in 2010. Major dissident groups have already said they will campaign to reject the military-drafted constitution. The NLD, by contrast, has failed to come up with a response. Since September's brutally crushed democracy protests, Suu Kyi has been allowed occasional meetings with members of the NLD leadership, although Tin Oo has not been allowed to attend. Myanmar has been under military rule of one form or another since 1962.
