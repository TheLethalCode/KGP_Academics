<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com)  Holders Mohammedan SC continued their shaky performance while Abahani stretched their winning streak in the Premier Division Twenty20 League Friday. After going down against newcomers Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan (BKSP) Thursday, Mohammedan lost to lowly Kalabagan KC by four wickets in their second match to raise fears of quitting from the preliminary round. Riding on two knocks from Arif Reza (43) and Robiul Islam (32 not out), Kalabagan raced to 127 for six in 18.4 overs in reply to Mohammedan's 125 for nine in 20 overs at the BKSP-1 ground. Abahani handed a two-wicket defeat to Biman Bangladesh, who set Abahani to chase 143 to win at the BKSP-2 ground. Javed Omar played a 48-ball 60 while Alok Kapali struck 39 off 24 balls, but the total was not safe for Biman as the Dhanmondi-based outfit lost eight wickets to reach the target with seven balls to spare. Opener Jahirul Islam gave a fine start with 26 off just 13 balls hitting four fours and one six. Later, Nadif Chowdhury (36) and Ziaur Rahman (28) played key roles in the middle before Arafat Sunny (15) and Nazmul Hossain (0) remained unbeaten to take Abahani home. Last year's runners-up Old DOHS bounced back in the second match to beat Sonargaon Cricketers by a nerve-wracking three runs after Thursday losing to promoted Surjo Torun, who Friday tasted their second triumph with a convincing eight-wicket win over Partex SC. DOHS restricted Sonargaon to 117 for seven in 20 overs after putting on 120 all out in 19.3 overs at the BKSP-1 ground. Mahbub Alam struck 56 off 34 balls to help DOHS cross the triple figures. At the BKSP-2 ground, Surjo Torun easily reached the target of 94 with two overs to go losing two wickets chasing a paltry total of 93 for eight in 20 overs set by Partex. Gazi Salahuddin hammered 54 as title contenders Victoria SC (115/4) registered their second win defeating Young Pegasus (113/6) by six wickets at the DCS. A blazing 50 runs from Golam Mabud powered City Club (152/6) to a fine 36-run win over BKSP (116/5) at the same venue.
