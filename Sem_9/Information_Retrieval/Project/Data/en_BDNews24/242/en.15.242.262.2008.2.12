<TITLE> Russia aims to close WTO entry talks by May </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Moscow, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia, the last major world economy outside the World Trade Organisation, hopes to complete entry talks with the Geneva-based body in May, a senior Russian trade official said on Tuesday. "We hope to close talks by May and, taking into account the organisational, legal and technical problems, around January 1 (2009) the obligations will become binding," said Andrei Kushnirenko, deputy head of the economy ministry's trade negotiations department. "I am giving an approximate date, but technically, if the negotiations are wrapped up by May, it could happen even earlier," he told journalists. He said there were three or four unresolved issues at a multilateral level, including allowable levels of support for the agricultural sector. Russia has been negotiating its entry into the WTO since 1993 and officials have often revised their timeline for joining the organisation. Moscow reached a bilateral access deal with the United States in 2006. This time, however, Russia has a reason to hurry, as it wants to avoid new bilateral conditions from Ukraine, which was accepted into the group this month. If Ukraine formalises its accession before Russia, its president, Viktor Yushchenko, has threatened to push Russia into a fresh round of "interesting negotiations", which may delay the process further.
