 Dili, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - East Timor's slain rebel leader Alfredo Reinado might have wanted to kidnap the president and kill the prime minister in a bid to oust foreign troops and force a snap election, a confidant told Reuters on Thursday. Fugitive army major Reinado and one of his followers died during an attack on President Jose Ramos-Horta's house in Dili on Monday. Ramos-Horta, 58, and a government soldier were critically wounded in the gunfight. Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao escaped a separate attack on his convoy, which is also believed to have been carried out by Reinado's followers. "If the prime minister was dead, there would be immediate elections. It is stated in our constitution," said Leandro Isaac, a legislator in the previous government who joined Reinado in the jungle briefly last year but who split from the rebels because he did not agree with their plans to conduct an armed rebellion. Isaac said he believed Reinado had planned to hold Ramos-Horta as a bargaining chip to press his demand for the withdrawal of foreign troops as well as foreign judges and prosecutors from the country. "He believed that the presence of these people is the source of injustice in Timor Leste," he said, referring to the tiny Southeast Asian nation. Reinado deserted the army in May 2006 to join about 600 former soldiers who had been sacked earlier that year. The soldiers complained that they had been discriminated against because they were from the western part of East Timor. The soldiers' dismissal sparked protests that degenerated into a wave of violence, in which 37 people died and about 150,000 people fled from their homes. In August 2006, Reinado escaped from Dili's prison where he was being held on murder charges related to the unrest earlier in the year. Later, he raided a police post and made off with dozens of weapons. A military campaign by Australian troops, backed by helicopters and military planes, failed to capture him at his jungle hideout. After the government called off the hunt, Reinado held several meetings with the country's leaders to negotiate a peaceful surrender. "The president was not the number one enemy of Alfredo because the president had agreed to meet almost all Alfredo's demands. It was incomprehensible that Alfredo had come to kill him" on Monday, Isaac said. Ramos-Horta had agreed to Alfredo's demand that he be tried in a military tribunal and that he be allowed to form a battalion consisting of troops from the western part of East Timor, where Reinado was from, Isaac said. Reinado enjoyed wide support among East Timorese youths, especially those from the western part of the country, who saw him as a hero defending their rights, and also among some politicians in parliament. But Isaac said Reinado had only a few army followers, and that they had been weakened militarily after his death, while the attacks on the country's popular leaders, Ramos-Horta and Gusmao, meant that support for his cause had evaporated. "They have no strength, let alone militarily. They are very few and are not at all comparable to FDTL (East Timor's military) or international troops," he said. He said Reinado's supporters were also those who backed Gusmao and Ramos-Horta in last year's elections. "That is why over the past several days there had been no reactions among young people and other members of the public," he said. "They are sad and confused. They supported Alfredo but Alfredo tried to kill their beloved leaders."
