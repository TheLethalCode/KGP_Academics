 DUBLIN/LONDON, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Irish crystal and fine china maker Waterford Wedgwood Plc said on Friday it would make a loss and cut 311 jobs in Germany after a delayed cash injection disrupted production in the key Christmas period. Shares in the company, best known for its Waterford glass and Wedgwood and Royal Doulton dining services, fell 14 percent after it predicted a core loss for the year to the end of March that would be "substantially" worse than broker expectations. The firm said a slowdown in consumption in its key markets in Britain and the United States meant sales for the year were set to be 4 percent lower than last year and that at constant exchange rates they would total about 700 million euros ($1 billion). Analysts said that after repeated profit warnings and attempts to raise funds, the outlook for the firm was uncertain at best. "The group has made substantial efforts to rejuvenate its product base over recent years but the weak like for like sales trends and challenges of fragile consumer sentiment lead us to retain our cautious stance," NCB analyst John Sheehan said in a research note. Davy analyst Mark Healy said the company's expectations of revenue in the region of 700 million euros and negative earnings before interest, debt and amortisation (EBITDA) compared with Davy's previous forecasts of 718 million euros revenue and 14 million euros EBITDA. The firm said 311 jobs would go at its German factories making Rosenthal china as part of a restructuring programme that will cost 12.5 million euros and should result in savings of 12.8 million euros a year. In November it cut almost 500 jobs at its Irish Crystal plant. Waterford Wedgwood, whose products were once a mainstay of wedding-gift lists worldwide, has been struggling for years to reverse a slump in demand by modernising its ranges. The company said the delayed receipt of funds from the issue of preference shares had impeded its ability to make and supply products to meet demand in the run-up to Christmas, leading to a 3 percent drop in sales in the three-month period to Dec. 31. Top shareholders, including company chairman Anthony O'Reilly who is one of Ireland's richest men, have repeatedly pumped extra funds into Waterford by subscribing to issues of new shares as it seeks to modernise and outsource production. Its thinly traded shares were down 14.7 percent in London at 1.63 euro cents at 1222 GMT and 10.5 percent weaker in Dublin where the broader Irish market was down 0.8 percent
