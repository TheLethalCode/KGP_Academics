 SARAJEVO, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Plans to teach Islamic religion classes as early as kindergarten in Sarajevo have divided the city between parents who slam the idea as segregation and those who see it as a basic religious right. The Bosnian capital, a symbol of multi-ethnic co-existence before and even during its 1992-95 siege by Bosnian Serb forces, is now predominantly Muslim. But it remains Bosnia's most tolerant and secular city, and a magnet for mixed families. Islamic religion classes are already offered on a voluntary basis from first grade onwards in Sarajevo. The new plans, proposed by 400 parents, would extend the voluntary lessons to nursery school as well. Sarajevo's schools do not offer classes in any other religions due to insufficient numbers of students. "I do not want to explain to my three-year-old son Sven, who is in love with (his Muslim classmate) Esma, why they suddenly have to sit in different rooms," said Vedrana Pinjo-Neuschul, a Bosnian Muslim married to a Jew, who is raising her son Jewish. "Nobody has the right to separate them." Pinjo-Neuschul objected to the religion classes so much, she launched a petition on the Internet to quash the plan. Nearly 5,000 people have signed the petition, which runs under the slogan "Stop Religious Segregation in Kindergarten". Children of Sarajevo -- the government office that runs the city's 24 public nursery schools -- says religion classes are a matter of choice by the parents, just like gym or foreign languages. Arzija Mahmutovic, who heads the office, said she was awaiting the approval from the city government to introduce the religious instruction in nursery schools. Sarajevo's Islamic community said in a news release that the classes were a religious right, and called the parents' petition "a culmination of an anti-Islamic campaign". The row has triggered widespread debate in the media, academia and across the city. "The idea to introduce religion classes in kindergarten is a stupid attempt at clericalisation ... and could lead to a triumph of religious banality," said university professor Enver Kazaz. The parents behind the petition say they have a right to be heard because their taxes partly finance the kindergartens. They also say the move would breach the constitutional definition of Bosnia as a secular state. The war between Bosnia's Muslims, Orthodox Serbs and Catholic Croats left deep scars on the country's psyche, and turned religion into a highly political issue. "In a multi-ethnic and multi-religious country this could pose a threat to basic freedoms granted by the constitution," said Meliha Causevic-Podzic, the spokeswoman for the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Europe's human rights and security watchd
