 Dhaka, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com)  The government has invited international bids for exploration of oil and gas in the Bay of Bengal, the energy secretary said Thursday. Secretary Mohammad Mohsin told bdnews24.com that advertisements would be posted soon and foreign missions informed. He expected enthusiastic responses from foreign firms, he said adding that interested firms would have to submit tenders in 10 weeks. Bangladesh Oil, Gas & Mineral Corporation (Petrobangla) invited the bids and will run advertisments in four newspapers Friday. Petrobangla director Muktadir Ali told bdnews24.com that Petrobangla would decide Sunday on posting advertisements in the international media. Details of the tender will be available on the Petrobangla website. The Bay will be divided into 28 blocks, for which tenders have been invited. The cabinet on Feb 5 approved a model PSC (production sharing contract) for the offshore exploration. Bangladesh invited international bids for exploring oil and gas in 23 blocks in fiscal 1993-94 for the first time. The international bids were invited in fiscal 1997-98 for a second time. A third attempt was made in 2005, but did not get through. bdnews
