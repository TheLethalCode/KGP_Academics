 NAIROBI, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kenya's feuding parties have agreed to an independent review of the country's disputed Dec. 27 election, but have yet to agree terms for power-sharing, chief mediator Kofi Annan said on Friday. Reporting on what he called "considerable" progress during this week's talks at a luxury safari lodge, the former U.N. boss also said it was essential for the parties to form a "broad coalition" to push through constitution and electoral reforms. Annan is trying to bring an immediate end to a post-election crisis which plunged the east African nation into one of its darkest moments since 1963 independence, with at least 1,000 killed and 300,000 displaced in politically-tinged violence. "The momentum is with us," Annan said. "I will stay as long as it takes to get the process to an irreversible point." Annan said he would meet President Mwai Kibaki and opposition leader Raila Odinga on Monday before talks resume on Tuesday between their parties. "If they do not come together for the interests of the country ... I think it is going to be very difficult for Kenya." Annan had taken negotiators from both sides to a luxury game resort for three days in the hope of striking a deal to end the immediate political crisis by the end of this week. But they flew back to the capital Nairobi on Thursday without agreeing on power-sharing, a sticking point seen by diplomats as essential to averting any more bloodshed. Annan tried to put a brave face on that. "It's not unusual for negotiations not to move at the speed you would want. There are very vital interests involved for all concerned," he said. U.S. PRESSURE Odinga accuses Kibaki of stealing the vote, but Kibaki says he won fairly and accuses the opposition of stoking violence instead of following Kenya's laws to challenge the result. The negotiators had agreed that an independent committee would review "all aspects" of the election, Annan said. It should start its work within a month, he added, and then report its findings within 3-6 months. The opposition wants to draft a new constitution, share power in the government and hold a new election within two years. The government wants constitutional and electoral law changes, but only applicable to the next election, due in 2012. The violence in Kenya has laid bare disputes over power, wealth and land. Ethnic bloodshed, violent protests and images of forlorn refugees have dented Kenya's reputation as one of the continent's most stable, prosperous democracies and hurt its booming economy. U.S. President George W. Bush, due to start a five-nation Africa tour on Saturday, has dispatched Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to throw her diplomatic weight behind the Annan initiative. Bush himself will not come to Kenya. Rice was due to meet Kibaki, Annan, Odinga and others in Kenya on Monday. Odinga's Orange Democratic Movement said in a statement Rice's visit was "a sign of the growing U.S. and international awareness that this grave crisis is far from over and that international pressure is essential to ensure" Annan succeeds
