<TITLE> Georgian businessman fought feud with president </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Moscow, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Badri Patarkatsishvili, who has died suddenly in Britain, was a rich and colourful Georgian businessman who fled his homeland after a feud with its president and was accused by the government of plotting a coup. Patarkatsishvili made his fortune in Russia during the mass privatisations of the 1990s and challenged President Mikhail Saakashvili in an election on Jan. 5, but lost after failing to return home to campaign for fear of arrest. A smoker with a cynical smile and a trademark silver moustache, he died late on Tuesday at his home in the town of Leatherhead, south of London. He was 52. Patarkatsishvili initially supported Saakashvili when he came to power in 2003 after street protests in the turbulent Caucasus state. They later fell out and began a political battle that lasted until his death. He told Reuters last November he hoped "outrageous legal violations and terror in our country are ended for ever, so that the principles of democracy can finally be victorious" in the former Soviet republic. Saakashvili's government accused him of plotting a coup after it closed down the television station Patarkatsishvili partly owned, used riot police to crush protests in the capital Tbilisi and imposed a state of emergency. Before the television station was stormed, Patarkatsishvili had addressed an opposition rally. He later said he feared that a plot had been hatched in Georgia to kill him and that Saakashvili had become a dictator who crushed dissent. Neither the coup allegation nor the charge of a murder plot was independently substantiated. Patarkatsishvili fled Georgia in November, and moved between homes in Britain and Israel. Despite pledging $1 billion of his own money to improve living standards, he won just 7.1 percent of the vote in last month's presidential election. Saakashvili won 53.4 percent, though the opposition said the election was rigged. In one of his final statements last month, he said the president was trying to "destroy the opposition and his political opponents, and enforce his falsified election." Georgian authorities deny the vote was rigged. Arkady (Badri) Shalvovich Patarkatsishvili was born on Oct. 31, 1955, in Tbilisi and went on to study in a technical institute and rise through a local fabric factory. A successful businessman undaunted by the chaos and crime of post-Soviet Russia, he became the business partner of Boris Berezovsky, once one of Russia's most influential businessmen. Together they ran one of Russia's biggest car firms, Logovaz, before moving into television, newspapers and commodities trading. They played a big role in the privatisation of oil firm Sibneft, earning fortunes and political clout. After Berezovsky fell foul of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Patarkatsishvili said Putin told him to side with the Kremlin or leave Moscow. He returned to Tbilisi and bought a soccer and basketball club and a local circus before going into opposition.
