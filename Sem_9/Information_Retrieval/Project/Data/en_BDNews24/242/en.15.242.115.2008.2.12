 Dhaka, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com)  Mohammad Ashraful will lead Mohammedan Sporting Club in the Premier Division Cricket League while national discard Manjurul Islam will be his deputy this season. The announcement came at an introductory programme of the cricketers and the members of the newly- formed cricket committee on the club premises Tuesday. The Motijheel-based outfit also announced a 17-member cricket committee with Golam M Alamgir and Hanif Bhuiya acting as chairman and secretary. A four-member committee comprising Mahbub Anam, Enayet Hossain Siraj, Khandakar Jamiluddin and MA Matin will be acting advisory members to the committee. Former Bangladesh skipper Minhajul Abedin Nannu will coach Mohammedan while Saim Hossain will be his assistant. The Premier Cricket Twenty20 League will start on Feb 14 with Mohammedan taking on Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan in the inaugural match at Dhanmondi Cricket Stadium. The Premier Cricket League is scheduled to start on March 3. Ashraful thanked the officials for appointing him captain and hoped to bring better results this season compared to those in the last edition. "My dream of playing for Mohammedan has come true as I am a supporter of this club from my childhood, and it is some different feeling to guide the favourite team," said Ashraful. "I was inspired to come to cricket seeing the performance of the then Mohammedan cricketer Aminul Islam Bulbul, who is also my idol," said Ashraful, who is also captain of the Bangladesh national cricket team. "Mohammedan emerged champions in Twenty20 League and finished second in Premier Cricket League last year and we will like to see our side finish top in both leagues," said Ashraful. The national cricketers will not be available in the Twenty20 league and the first portion of the premier league due to their national engagement. They are likely to play six to seven matches during the later part of the league. Golam M Alamgir, chairman of the cricket committee, said that they had formed a better side compared to that in the last edition and hoped that Ashraful would lead the team to the championship. Alamgir said that they would pay hundred percent to the players in line with agreements they had in the last edition.
