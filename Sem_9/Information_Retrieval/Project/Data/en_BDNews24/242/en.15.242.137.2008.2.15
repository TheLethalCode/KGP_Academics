 Dhaka, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com)Sheikh Hasina's doctor has said that the Awami League chief should be transferred to Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University hospital for immediate medical attention. Prof ABM Abdullah told bdnews24.com Friday that he had advised the authorities to transfer the former prime minister to hospital following an examination. Hasina's physician spent one and a half hours at the special jail on the Sangsad Bhaban complex where the party chief is currently detained. "I advised that Sheikh Hasina should be shifted to BSMMU in the presence of the IG and DIG of prisons," Abdullah told bdnews24.com. "They seemed quite concerned about her treatment. They assured me that she would be treated wherever she would like to," he said. Prof Abdullah said the AL chief was "very sick", although her blood pressure appeared normal. "She was feeling less nauseous this morning, although she appeared weak. She suffers from allergies and has got an eye problem among other things," he said. "However, her left ear seems to be the worst-affected area. She suffered a hearing loss in her left ear after the 2004 grenade attack," he said. Hasina has been using a hearing aid since the attack. "I noticed that the hearing aid is not working properly at the moment. She should actually to go abroad to have all those complications treated properly," he said. Inspector general of prisons Zakir Hasan and deputy inspector general of prisons Shamsul Haider Siddiqui were present during the examination. Siddiqui told bdnews24.com that the doctor had examined Hasina in the morning and advised her relocation to BSMMU. "We will do that as soon as she agrees to be transferred," Siddiqui said. "Her relatives also said she was not satisfied with the government's arrangements for her treatment. Now it's up to her, she'll be treated wherever she wants, and by whomever she wants," the DIG said. bdnews
