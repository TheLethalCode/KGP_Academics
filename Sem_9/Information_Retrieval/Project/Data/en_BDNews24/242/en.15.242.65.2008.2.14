 SYDNEY, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - International cricket is in danger of losing its top players to India's lucrative Twenty20 competitions unless their countries agreed to let them play, Australia captain Ricky Ponting said. Ponting, who is among a group of Australians currently negotiating to play in the Indian Premier League (IPL), fears players may turn their backs on their national teams if they were prevented from joining the IPL. "I think there are some dangers there to tell you the truth," Ponting told a news conference in Perth on Thursday. "If a guy is approaching the end of his international career anyway, being able to play 44 days and stay in one form of the game, I'm sure is very attractive. "Particularly if they have families and they are getting a bit sick and tired of the travel you do with international cricket, I am sure that is appealing to some." The IPL has been officially endorsed by the International Cricket Council (ICC) but players cannot compete in the tournament if it clashes with their national duties. Cricket Australia officials have indicated they would support a proposal to create a separate time slot for the tournament so there would be no clashes. Ponting agrees. "There are some programming issues the ICC and the boards are going to have to look at, maybe carving out a window each year where this tournament can sit in," he said. "The danger for me is the IPL one, when unless some time is given up then we might start losing the 33, 34-year-old players from international cricket." REBEL LEAGUE International cricket has already been hit by a series of high-profile retirements in the past month involving players who have signed with the IPL or the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL). Australia have warned their players not to sign with the ICL, saying it would threaten their chances of re-selection for the national side. "Selectors will treat players who take part only in ICC-approved matches (the IPL) more favourably than those who do not," Cricket Australia said in a statement. CA are also refusing to agree to let their players join the IPL because of a contractual row over sponsorship but chief executive James Sutherland said there was still some chance of a resolution before Sunday's deadline. "We have always said we want to see IPL succeed, but on the basis that it does not compromise ICC Future Tours Program or ICC Events cricket," he said. "There is a lot of detail involved in aligning existing contractual obligations with those of this new Indian domestic competition. "But we are approaching this with an open mind on trying to resolve the issue in a manner which allows IPL to go ahead with Australian player participation, when available.
