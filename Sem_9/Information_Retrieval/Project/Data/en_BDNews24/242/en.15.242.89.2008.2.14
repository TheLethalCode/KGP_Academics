 Khulna, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com)Khulna University vice-chancellor Dr Md Mahbubur Rahman, who found his stint tainted by allegations of corruption, has resigned 13 months before his tenure completes. Dr Mahbub, who has been staying in Canada for about two months, faxed his resignation letter to the education ministry Wednesday, KU treasurer Prof Sheikh Abdul Hasib told bdnews24.com. Prof Hasib, also acting vice chancellor, said: "The ministry's deputy secretary Md Rais Uddin has informed me about the matter." The teacher would not explain the reason for the vice chancellor's resignation. Prof Mahbub, once Dhaka University teacher, was appointed vice-chancellor to KU in March 2005, only to run into allegations of corruption and irregularities in appointment of teachers and officials. His tenure at the KU was smeared by two instances of fraud involving enrolment of students. Amid allegations of irregularity and corruption against him last December, the education ministry barred all appointments. Besides, the University Grants Commission on Jan 17 formed a committee to probe the accusations against Prof Mahbub, with the commission's member Prof Md Abdul Hakim as the convenor of the committee. Prof Mahbub went to Canada on Dec 14 on a one-month leave. bdnews2
