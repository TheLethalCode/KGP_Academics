"In agreeing Lee's request I have also made the extremely difficult decision that ... Lee Jasper will be suspended pending the outcome of the police investigation," he added. Liberal Democrat Mayoral candidate Brian Paddick said the suspension cast doubt on Livingstone's judgement in selecting advisors. "Because of the complexity of the allegations that have been made, it's unlikely that any of these investigations will be concluded by 1 May," said Paddick, a former senior London police officer.
