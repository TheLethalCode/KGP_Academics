<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com)Jahangirnagar University has erected the country's tallest Shaheed Minar on its campus to commemorate Language Movement martyrs. Vice-chancellor of the university, Prof Khondoker Mustahidur Rahman, inaugurated the 71-foot high memorial Wednesday, although the structure was completed a year ago. No permanent memorial to the Language Movement martyrs previously existed on the university grounds. The new Shaheed Minar, designed by architect Robiul Hossain, is sited in front of the university's newly constructed Arts Building. Three 71-foot tall pillars form a triangle on top of a 52-foot long brick-built base. The length of the base signifies the importance of the year 1952 in the Language Movement. The three pillars represent eight other important landmarks leading to Bangladesh's liberation: 1947, 1952, 1958, 1962, 1966, 1969, 1970 and 1971. The first pillar represents the Bangla language, arts and culture; the second speaks of history, tradition and people, while the third symbolises sovereignty, the Liberation War and freedom. The university, famous for its leafy beauty, is often referred to as the 'campus of culture' or 'campus of nature'. bdnews
