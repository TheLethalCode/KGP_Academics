 BEIRUT, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Lebanon's central bank governor said on Friday inflation for 2008 should not exceed the five percent of last year and forecast stable interest rates which may fall if the country's political crisis eases. Riad Salameh said in an interview he did not expect a repeat of steep inflation that was driven by a climb in the prices of oil, commodities and the euro in the last quarter of 2007. "We don't think that inflation should be over 5 percent this year," Salameh said. "We think the adjustment has been made." Interest rates would remain stable or fall if there was a resolution to Lebanon's political crisis, which has paralysed much of government for 15 months, left the country without a president since November and led to street violence. "We see interest rates remaining stable in Lebanon and (they) could decline if there's a political improvement," Salameh said. Banks currently offer around 5 percent on dollar deposits and 8 percent for deposits in Lebanese pounds. The political crisis led Standard & Poor's in January to cut its long-term sovereign foreign currency rating on Lebanon by one notch to "CCC+" from "B-". Moody's on Feb. 7 affirmed its low "B3" rating for Lebanon government bonds but, citing high foreign currency reserves, said a downgrade was not imminent despite the crisis and weak economy. The political conflict, the worst crisis since the 1975-90 civil war, pits the Western-backed governing coalition against an opposition alliance led by the Syria-backed Hezbollah. HEAVY BURDEN Lebanon has the highest debt burden of any country rated by Moody's, with a gross public debt of some $42.06 billion -- equivalent to 171 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). The public debt, much of it held by Lebanese banks, was mostly accumulated from the costs of reconstruction after the 1975-90 civil war. Responding to the S&P report, Salameh said: "The track record of Lebanon, its ability to refinance its debt, has been verified by the resilience of the financial sector during the past three years." "The banks are capitalised enough to keep playing their role as financial providers for the private and the public sector." The government this year will seek to refinance some $2.1 billion of maturing bonds, the first of which mature in March, Salameh said. He did not expect S&P's new rating to affect the operation. "We have conducted a similar operation on central bank certificates of deposit. We had $1.8 billion of certificates of deposit maturing in March and we have already exchanged that for five years, prior to maturity," Salameh said. "We saw good demand and a good response on this operation." Most of the $2.1 billion in maturing government bonds would be rolled over domestically, he said. "It will be mainly local, because the bonds are mainly held locally," Salameh said. The spread between Lebanese government-issued Eurobonds and U.S. treasury bonds is around 550 to 600 basis points, having increased from 350 to 400 in October, Salameh added. "The worldwide markets are seeing lower interest rates, so the spread between Lebanon and the United States ... has increased instead of remaining stable. This is the real consequence of this kind of report or of political or security crises," said Salameh, in reference to the S&P rating. "To see lower interest rates ... we need more stability on the political side, and of course on the security side.
