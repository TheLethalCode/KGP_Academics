 Kuala Lumpur, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi called on Wednesday for early general elections, at a date to be fixed by electoral authorities. Abdullah said he had advised the king to dissolve federal parliament about a year before its five-year term was due to end. He gave no reason, but analysts have said the ruling coalition wants a fresh mandate before the economy slows and inflation picks up steam. The ruling coalition hopes to retain a two-thirds majority of the 222 seats up for grabs at the polls, Abdullah added. The Election Commission will meet soon to fix the election date, though political analysts expect it to be held during the first ten days of March. Elections were not due to be held until May 16, 2009
