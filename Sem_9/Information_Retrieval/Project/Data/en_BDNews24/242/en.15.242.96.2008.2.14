 MOSCOW, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin, playing down recent hawkish statements from Moscow, said on Thursday Russia did not plan a conflict with the West and would not point its missiles at any state unless it had to. "We are not going to retarget anything at anyone without extreme necessity," Putin told journalists at his annual Kremlin news conference. "We plan no conflicts (with the West) and we hope this will not happen in the foreseeable future." Putin said earlier this week Russia might target Ukraine if its former Soviet neighbour joined NATO and deployed elements of a U.S. missile defence shield. He has made similar threats about missile shield deployment against Poland and the Czech Republic. The news conference in the Kremlin's Round Hall, which was televised live, was Putin's seventh and was expected to be the last before his second term in office ends in May. Russia holds presidential elections next month which are widely expected to be won by Putin's chosen successor, First Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. Asked whether he had considered staying in power longer, Putin said it was "absolutely unacceptable" for him to cling to power for life. "I had no intention to stay for a third term, never," Putin told journalists. "From the first day I assumed office as the president of the Russian Federation, I have always said I will follow the law." Russia's constitution limits presidents to two consecutive terms, although Putin's domestic popularity has led to calls from supporters for him to change the constitution and stay on. Speaking on a raised platform in front of a background decorated with Russia's national colours and flanked either side by two giant television screens, Putin said it was "not shameful or frightening" for him to plan to hand over to Medvedev. He began the news conference by reeling off statistics describing Russia's economic boom, which has lasted throughout his presidency. Real incomes, pensions and living standards had all risen, he said, though close attention needed to be paid to inflation, now running at around 12 percent. "I do not see any serious failures," Putin told a questioner. "All the tasks we set ourselves have been achieved". Putin, a youthful 55, intends to remain active in politics after his presidential term ends and has said he will become Medvedev's prime minister. Officials said that a record 1,364 journalists were accredited for the news conference, an annual marathon carried live on state television across Russia. Last year's news conference lasted three hours 32 minutes and Putin fielded more than 60 questions on subjects ranging from the presidential succession to the idea of setting up an OPEC-style gas producers' group with Iran and other natio
