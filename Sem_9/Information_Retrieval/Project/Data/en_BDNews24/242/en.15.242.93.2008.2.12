<TITLE> EU to seek common stand on US air marshals move </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Ljuljana, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - EU president Slovenia said on Tuesday it hoped the European Union would agree a common stance on a US push for the union to allow armed air marshals aboard US air carriers flying to or from the bloc. The United States is also pushing for more information on passengers flying to or from the 27-nation grouping in a memorandum of understanding sent to several European countries. Washington has annoyed the EU Commission and a number of European capitals by making direct contacts with only some EU countries, as talks on air security have so far been conducted at a global EU-U.S. level. Slovenia's Interior Minister Dragutin Mate said the document must first be examined by the European Commission and Slovenia -- the latter in its capacity as the current holder of the EU's rotating presidency. "Because of the nature of the document we need to study it very closely. Even a comma could make a difference," Mate told Reuters, adding he received the document late on Monday. "I hope that we will be able to reach an agreement at the level of the European Union," he added. Diplomats say ambassadors from EU member states would on Wednesday discuss how to react to what some have seen as an attempt by Washington to bypass the European Union and get more out of separate deals with individual countries.
