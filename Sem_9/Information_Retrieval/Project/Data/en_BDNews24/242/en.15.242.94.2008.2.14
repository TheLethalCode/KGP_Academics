<TITLE> Hezbollah to bury slain commander, Israel on alert </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIRUT, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Lebanon's Hezbollah holds a mass funeral for its assassinated commander Imad Moughniyah, one of the United States' most wanted men, in Beirut on Thursday amid calls for revenge against its sworn enemy Israel. The Jewish state put its embassies and other interests abroad on high alert and boosted troop deployments on the Lebanese border for fear of reprisal. Hezbollah and its main backer Iran accused Israel of killing Moughniyah in a bomb blast in Syria on Tuesday. The Israeli government rejected the charge, though its Mossad spy service had long sought to kill him. Big crowds are expected in Beirut's Shia Muslim southern suburb to bid farewell to Moughniyah, a guerrilla seen as a legend by Hezbollah but on the U.S. most wanted list accused of killing hundreds in attacks on Israeli and Western targets. Iran's Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki is expected to attend the funeral. Reflecting deep divisions in Lebanon, Moughniyah's funeral will take place shortly after a rally by the anti-Syrian ruling coalition to mark the third anniversary of the killing of former Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri. Tens of thousands, many waving red, white and green Lebanese flags, began gathering in pouring rain at Martyrs' Square in the centre of Beirut to listen to speeches by anti-Syrian leaders, including Hariri's son and political heir, Saad. The anti-Syrian coalition is locked in a 15-month power struggle with the Hezbollah-led opposition that has left Lebanon without a president since November. Hariri's assassination on Feb. 14, 2005, plunged Lebanon into its worst crisis since the 1975-90 civil war and led to the withdrawal of Syrian forces from the country. Anti-Syrian politicians blame Damascus for Hariri's death. Syria denies any links. The standoff between the ruling coalition and opposition has spilled over into several clashes over the last year. MAJOR BLOW Moughniyah was the most senior member of Hezbollah to be killed since its previous secretary-general, Abbas Mussawi, died in a 1992 Israeli helicopter ambush in southern Lebanon. Moughniyah, 45, had long been on a list of foreigners Israel wanted to kill or capture and had been top of Washington's wanted list before al Qaeda's Osama bin Laden emerged as an enemy of the United States. He was implicated in the 1983 bombings of the U.S. embassy and U.S. Marine and French peacekeeping barracks in Beirut, which killed over 350 people, as well as the kidnapping of Westerners in Lebanon in the 1980s. Israel accuses Moughniyah of planning the 1994 bombing of a Jewish centre in Buenos Aires that killed 85 people and of involvement in a 1992 bombing of the Israeli embassy in the Argentine capital that killed 28. The United States indicted him for his role in planning and participating in the 1985 hijacking of a U.S. TWA airliner and the killing of an American passenger. Washington welcomed Moughniyah's death. Several Palestinian and Lebanese allies of Hezbollah called on the group to avenge Moughniyah's death. Hezbollah has only said its conflict with Israel was "a very long one". Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the group that has a strong political and military force in Lebanon, will address the crowd at the funeral via a video link. Moughniyah's coffin, draped in a Hezbollah flag and flanked by four men in uniform, was laid in a hall where his family and the group's leaders received condolences for a second day. Moughniyah is thought to have been commander of Islamic Jihad, a shadowy pro-Iranian group which emerged in Lebanon in the early 1980s and was believed to be linked to Hezbollah. The group claimed many kidnappings and bombings but disappeared after the release of the last Western hostages in Lebanon shortly after the end of the civil war in 19
