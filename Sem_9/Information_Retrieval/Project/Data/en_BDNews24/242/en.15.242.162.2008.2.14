 Dhaka, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com)Lawyers and engineers, adherent to the Awami League, Thursday demanded immediate release of the party's detained president Sheikh Hasina. In a joint statement, as many as 201 Supreme Court lawyers urged the government to withdraw the cases against the former prime minister terming them "false and tools of harassment". In another statement, 101 engineers urged the government to free the AL president from prison "as soon as possible". "It is unfair and inhuman to keep Sheikh Hasina confined as the so-called extortion case has proved to be false and void. Let Sheikh Hasina come out of the jail for the sake of people," said the engineers' joint statement. Meanwhile, former leaders of AL student wing, Bangladesh Chhatra League, Boloram Poddar, Marufa Akter Popi and Rafiqul Islam also demanded release of Hasina. They also urged the government to make sure that Hasina, who was arrested on July 16 last year, received proper treatment from doctors of choice. They warned that the government would have to shoulder the responsibility if Hasina faced any mishap. bdnews2
