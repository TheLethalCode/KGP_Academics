<TITLE> Mugabe set for landmark election against former ally </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 HARARE, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe registered on Friday as a candidate in a March 29 election, facing a challenge from a former ally who has vowed to make the crumbling economy the campaign's focus. Mugabe is seeking another five-year term to extend his 28-year rule of the once-prosperous southern African country. Rivals say his re-election would be a disaster for Zimbabweans who are suffering from an economic meltdown, highlighted on Thursday when Zimbabwe said annualised inflation topped 66,000 percent in December -- a new record. Millions of Zimbabweans are expected to vote in presidential, parliamentary and municipal polls. Mugabe and his opponents have described the event as a landmark election in the country's post-independence period. "We're very confident of victory, 99.9 percent confident," Emerson Mnangagwa, a cabinet minister and official with the ruling ZANU-PF party, told reporters after presenting Mugabe's election registration papers to a court in Harare. The opposition is concerned the elections will not be free. Mugabe has been widely accused of rigging the last three major elections and of using security forces to quell dissent. Earlier this week Mugabe, who turns 84 next week, told state media that he was "raring to go" into the election. But Mugabe, who was described as a "discredited dictator" on Thursday by U.S. President George W. Bush, must contend with Simba Makoni, a renegade former finance minister who is running for president as an independent. EXPELLED The ZANU-PF expelled Makoni, 58, earlier this week after he announced what many observers consider the most serious challenge to the veteran Zimbabwean leader, who has been in power since independence from Britain in 1980. Makoni, accompanied by his wife, filed his registration papers at the court in Harare on Friday. Morgan Tsvangirai, the leader of the main faction of the Movement for Democratic Change, the country's largest opposition party, also filed on Friday to contest the presidential election, although he did not do so in person. The leader of a smaller faction of the MDC, who has pulled out of the race, backed Makoni. "I am here today to announce to Zimbabweans that our political party has decided that, in pursuit of national interests, we are endorsing the presidential bid by Simba Makoni," Arthur Mutambara, leader of the group that split from Tsvangirai's main faction in 2005, told reporters. "Makoni has shown courage by standing up to Mugabe." Analysts had previously said that Makoni's entry could split the opposition and spur Mugabe's re-election. Critics say government mismanagement has plunged the country into a crisis that is marked by soaring poverty, widespread malnutrition and chronic food and fuel shortages. Mugabe says the problems are the result of sabotage by Western powers who are opposed to his policy of seizing white-owned farms and redistributing the land to blacks. Despite accusations of widespread human rights violations, Mugabe is regarded in much of Africa as an anti-colonial champion and hero of the liberation era of the 1960s and 1970s
