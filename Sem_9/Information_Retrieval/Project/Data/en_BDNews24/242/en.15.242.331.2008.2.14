<TITLE> Police probe Deutsche Post CEO, stage dawn raid </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 COLOGNE, Germany, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police raided the home and offices of Klaus Zumwinkel, the chief executive of Deutsche Post AG and a pillar of Germany's corporate establishment, as part of what one source close to the investigation said was a probe into suspected tax evasion. A company spokesman confirmed the dawn raid at the group's office tower in the western German city of Bonn and that 64-year-old Zumwinkel was the focus of the inquiry, but declined to say what he was being investigated for. German media reported earlier on Thursday that Zumwinkel, the longest-serving chief executive in the DAX index of top German companies, was suspected of having transferred millions of euros to Liechtenstein to evade German taxes. Zumwinkel's large, three-storey private villa in a leafy suburb of the nearby city of Cologne was raided in the early hours of Thursday, the source said. Hours later, Zumwinkel, dressed smartly and wearing a dark overcoat, was taken from his home in an unmarked police limousine. His destination was not immediately known. Highlighting the seriousness of the case, a source close to the investigation told Reuters that prosecutors had obtained an arrest warrant for Zumwinkel but said it was highly unlikely that Zumwinkel would actually be arrested at this point. A spokesman for the prosecutors confirmed that "several persons" were being investigated for tax evasion, but declined to say who was under investigation. "At the moment, investigations are taking place in Cologne and Bonn," the spokesman said. Prosecutors said an official statement would be released later on Thursday. "MANAGER OF THE YEAR" One of Germany's most prominent executives and named by Manager Magazin as its 2003 "Manager of the Year", multi-millionaire Zumwinkel transformed Deutsche Post from a sleepy state monopoly to a global mail, logistics and finance group. The former McKinsey partner has led the group since 1990. He presided over its flotation in 2000 and took the helm of Deutsche Telekom's supervisory board in 2003. Zumwinkel said late last year he would decide on his future with Post in the summer of 2008 as his contract runs out in November. The probe may now force Zumwinkel out sooner and helped boost Deutsche Post's stock on Thursday. The shares were the top gainers in the DAX, up 2.4 percent at 1229 GMT. Zumwinkel has sought to reduce Post's dependence on its domestic mail business by expanding its DHL express and logistics divisions and through acquisitions. But he has struggled to reverse losses at DHL Express' business in the United States, and recently signalled the company could sell retail bank Deutsche Postbank, in which Post owns the majority. Post's finance chief John Allan, who took over the role last year tasked with restoring investor confidence and who has pledged to improve performance in the United States, could now find his position at the firm bolstered, leading to faster change, analysts said. "We believe that this investigation will weaken Zumwinkel's strength on the board and, in turn, strengthen Allan's," Bear Stearns analyst Andrew Beh wrote. "The stronger Allan is, the more likely Postbank gets sold to the highest bidder sooner and the US business is restructured thoroughly." Meanwhile, Deutsche Post board member Frank Appel, who has been lined up as a successor to Zumwinkel, took over the running of the company, the Financial Times Deutschland report
