 LONDON, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The body of Georgian opposition leader Badri Patarkatsishvili will be taken home for burial once British investigators have released their final report on the cause of his death, his family said on Friday. Patarkatsishvili, Georgia's richest man, dropped dead on Tuesday evening at his mansion in southern England. He had frequently spoken of his fears of assassination. British police have said they have no reason yet to believe the 52-year-old was killed, but that toxicology tests to determine the cause of his death could take up to ten weeks. His body cannot be released for burial until police have completed tests to rule out foul play. "We have lost our son, father, husband, and our most beloved person," his family said in a statement on Friday, their first public comment since Patarkatsishvili's death. "We completely trust the professionalism of the British police and criminal experts. As soon as the final forensic report is released on the causes of his death, we will transfer Badri's body to Georgia and commit it to his native land." Patarkatsishvili had lived in Britain since late last year, after Georgian authorities issued an arrest warrant against him, accusing him of plotting a coup against the president. He ran as a candidate in Georgia's presidential election on Jan.5, winning about 7 percent of the vote, but did not campaign in his homeland for fear of detention
