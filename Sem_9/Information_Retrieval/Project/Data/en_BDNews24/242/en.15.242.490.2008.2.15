<TITLE> Serbian president Tadic vows to preserve Kosovo </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BELGRADE, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Boris Tadic was sworn in as president of Serbia on Friday, two days before Kosovo declares independence in Serbia's most traumatic moment since it was bombed by NATO in 1999 to end ethnic cleansing in the province. "I will never give up fighting for our Kosovo and I will, with all my might, fight for Serbia to join the European Union," Tadic said after taking the oath of office. Kosovo, a mountain-ringed province, is steeped in Serb myth but now home to 2 million Albanians, a 90 percent majority. Nationalist Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, who has eclipsed pro-Western Tadic to become undisputed champion of Serbia's unity, has told Serbs that Kosovo's breakaway is "about to become a reality" that he cannot stop but will never accept. Most EU members plus the United States plan to recognise Kosovo. They say Serbia relinquished the moral right to rule its people because of the brutality it used against them in 1998-99 under the late Slobodan Milosevic, and because there is no hope of compromise. Tadic and Kostunica are at odds over Serbia continuing to pursue EU membership if EU states approve Kosovo's secession. Serbia and its ally Russia insist the legal rights of sovereignty and territorial integrity are more important than an ethnic minority's demands for self-determination. Serbia has offered autonomy to Kosovo Albanians within Serb borders, but no role as full citizens. The West believes this formula is unsustainable in the long term. Kosovo has already been under United Nations administration and NATO protection for nearly nine years. Its leader Hashim Thaci says he can count on recognition by 100 countries. "OURS TO THE END" Prime ministers of both Kosovo and Serbia called for calm in the countdown to Kosovo's proclamation. Kostunica urged Kosovo's 120,000 Serbs to stay in the province and Kosovo's Hashim Thaci urged Serb refugees to return. "I invite all those who want to, to return to their homes and their property, including displaced Serbs living outside Kosovo," he told a news conference. "In Kosovo, there will be security for all citizens. The government is committed to looking forward to the future and overcoming the sad past." Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic told the United Nations on Thursday Serbia would not use military force, but "all diplomatic, political, and economic measures ... to impede and reverse this direct and unprovoked attack on our sovereignty". Kosovo, he said, would be "ours to the end". Hardline nationalism is still a powerful force in Serbia. No mainstream politician has taken the risk of conceding that Kosovo may have been effectively lost nine years ago when thousands of Albanian civilians were killed by Serb forces. Nationalists have called for protests in Belgrade next week against the United States and European Union. Tens of thousands are expected to participate. Ambassadors are preparing to withdraw from EU embassies for consultations at home. Russia says the West is letting a dangerous genie out of the bottle by backing secession without U.N. approval. The move would influence its policy towards Georgia's breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Moscow said. The West says Kosovo sets no precedent but is a unique case, caused by the savagery of a regime towards an ethnic minority. Ethnic Albanians in the borderlands of Macedonia, Montenegro and south Serbia discount concern they too will attempt to secede to create a "Greater Albania" in the Balkans. But the shockwaves of Yugoslavia's long and bloody collapse could rumble on. In Bosnia, Serbs who won an autonomous half of the country in the peace deal that ended the 1992-95 war say they too will demand to secede if Kosovo gets its way
