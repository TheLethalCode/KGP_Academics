 Dhaka, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com)Khaleda Zia's adviser ASM Hannan Shah considers himself "a victor and an optimist" after being released from jail, he said Wednesday. He was speaking publicly for the first time, after a meeting at the NAM residence of Khaleda-appointed BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, since being released on bail Tuesday night. Nazrul Islam Khan, joint secretary general of the party, told bdnews24.com: "The meeting between Hannan Shah and Delwar Hossain was held behind closed doors." "We stayed outside and I don't know the topic of the meeting." Hannan Shah told the reporters that they discussed party organisation and the political situation. "I will speak again to reporters after further discussion with party leaders," he said. Over a hundred BNP leaders and workers greeted him as he arrived earlier at Delwar's home. The High Court granted three months' interim bail Sunday to the BNP leader who was detained for violating emergency powers rules. Hannan Shah had earlier been arrested on Nov 7 in connection with an incidence of violence near the late president Ziaur Rahman's grave at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar as BNP leaders marked National Revolution and Solidarity Day. On Jan 30, the High Court declared his detention in this connection illegal and granted him bail. Fatullah police re-arrested Hannan Shah on Feb 7 at the gate of Narayanganj jail in connection with a separate case. A police sub inspector had filed a general diary against him with Fatullah Police Station on allegations that Hannan Shah led a rally at nearby Link Road. The High Court bench of justices Khademul Islam Chowdhury and Md Abdul Hye issued the bail order after Hannan Shah appealed for cancellation of the case. bdnew
