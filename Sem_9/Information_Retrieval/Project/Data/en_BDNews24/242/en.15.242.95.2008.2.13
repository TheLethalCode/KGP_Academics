<TEXT>
 DURBAN, South Africa, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Left-arm spinner Robin Peterson will replace Paul Harris in the South African squad to tour Bangladesh, Cricket South Africa (CSA) said on Wednesday. A CSA statement said Harris would miss the tour because of an abscess that required surgery. "Robbie has shown excellent form in the (first-class) Supersport Series," selection chief Joubert Strydom said in the statement. "He was the leading wicket-taker among South African spin bowlers with 24 wickets." Peterson's call-up brings the number of black players in the 14-man squad to five. The naming of the squad was delayed after the selectors and CSA president Norman Arendse became embroiled in a dispute over the number of black players who were chosen. CSA's transformation policy sets a target of seven black players in squads of 15, and six in a squad of 14. South Africa will play two tests and three one-day internationals in Bangladesh
