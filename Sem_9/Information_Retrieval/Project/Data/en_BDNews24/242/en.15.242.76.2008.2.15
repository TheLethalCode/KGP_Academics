<TEXT>
 Noakhali, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com)Army chief General Moeen U Ahmed said Friday that he would like to see Bangladesh become a middle-income country by 2020. "The army wants to ensure that Bangladesh is no longer known as a poor country," Moeen said at the inauguration of a small milk farm project at the Sharifpur Union Parishad complex in Begumganj upazila. Moeen said the army had implemented the small milk farm project to alleviate poverty in the country. He said only 19 percent of milk products consumed in the country are produced domestically. "Our neighbours in India used to import milk products until recently, and now they are exporting," Moeen said. The army chief urged the interim government to supply necessary fertiliser, seeds and insecticides to the farmers. "No land can be kept uncultivated." "By using new seeds and technology we can surely meet the food requirements of the country, and export as well," he said. The army chief said the amount of bio-gas produced by cow dung from one small milk farm can provide enough fuel for the need of 10 families. The army chief also advised related agencies to spread the system of manufacturing granular fertiliser, locally known as guti, using bio-gas throughout the country. Later, the army chief distributed agricultural equipment to the members of Alipur Youth Cooperative and released fish fry in a pond cultivated by the cooperative. bdnews2
