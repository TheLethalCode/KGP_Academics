<TEXT>
 Khulna, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com)  The Khulna divisional speedy trial tribunal Wednesday acquitted all seven accused of the charges of killing journalist Humayun Kabir Balu. The court of judge Abdus Salam Sikder in his rule, however, said the police report and the subsequent investigation were flawed. The judge mentioned that the accused were not identified clearly in the documents. Balu was killed in a bomb attack in front of his daily Janmabhumi office in the southwestern town on June 27, 2004. Five accused were in the dock Wednesday when the judge handed down the verdict while two remained fugitive. They are Zahidur Rahman, Nazrul Islam, Iqbal Hossain Shwadhin, Masum known as Jahangir and Sheikh Nazimuddin. Abdur Rashid Malitha, known to be the chief of outlawed Purba Banglar Communist Party (ML-Janajuddha), was among the fugitives. Malitha is popularly known as Dada Tapan. Another man on the run is Sheikh Sadikur Rahman. Khulna journalists were not happy with the verdict while Balu's family had previously rejected the chragesheet, saying they were not properly framed. His family members had refused to appear in court as witnesses. Asir Kabir, son of Balu and the current editor of his father's daily, said the verdict was the ultimate outcome of a flawed police report and improper investigation. Khulna Press Club president Wadudur Rahman Panna said the killers would be inspired, as they had not been punished. He said it would put journalists' lives at further stake. bdnews2
