 Dhaka, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com) An effective information society can "bridge the digital divide" and "connect the unconnected", chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed said Thursday. Addressing the inauguration of the `BASIS SOFTEXPO 2008' as chief guest Thursday morning Fakhruddin said: "Our government is committed to building an effective information society in the country." "The task of building the information society is not about technology alone, it is about end results of technology. BASIS SOFTEXPO has become the biggest showcase for software, IT enabled services and ICT system solutions in the country. This year the theme of the event is "Get. Gain. Grow". Information technology is about people, the chief adviser said. "And it is about achieving their social, cultural and economic aspiration. Eradicating poverty and improving livelihoods, conserving the environment, improving health care and increasing food supply" he added. "Our government has taken a number of initiatives for e-governance in different ministries, divisions, departments and corporations," Fakhruddin said. "The government is also looking forward to newer public-private initiatives, particularly in the areas of e-Governance implementation, human resources and infrastructure development in the IT sector for facilitating its further growth." "I would like to call BASIS and other relevant stakeholders in the sector to come forward with specific suggestions and action plans for rapid development of our IT-enabled service sector industry" he said. Addressing the foreign delegates and entrepreneurs of the exposition Fakhruddin asked them to consider direct investment in the form of joint ventures or 100 percent owned offshore centres. Bangladesh offers unlimited opportunities for the growth of the ICT industry, he added. Printing out some limitations for adaptation of ICTs, Fakhruddin listed a number of the key the caretaker government's measures over the past one year to overcome these weaknesses. They included: a.Formulation of International Long Distance policy in under implementation. b.Formulation of National Broadband policy, which will be approved soon. c.Reduction of bandwidth price.
