<TITLE> Malaysia sets for general election on March 8 </TITLE>

 Kuala Lumpur, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Malaysia will hold a general election on March 8, the Election Commission said on Thursday, with the premier taking the country to the polls early despite growing discord over race and religious issues. The next election was not due until May 2009. Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, in power since 2003, secured the dissolution of parliament on Wednesday and is viewed as certain to win the poll, but with a reduced majority. He faces a likely swing against the ruling coalition, with minority ethnic Chinese and Indians particularly unhappy with his government, which is dominated by ethnic Malay politicians. Analysts say he is calling a poll now because the electoral mood is unlikely to improve through the rest of his current term and that the economy, his main selling point, is slowing down. The election schedule leaves only 13 days of campaigning between the day for nominating candidates, Feb. 24, and polling day. Under Malaysian electoral rules, parties can only start active campaigning after nomination day. Commission Chairman Abdul Rashid Abdul Rahman defended the campaign period, which is traditionally short in Malaysia after a lengthy and racially divisive campaign almost 40 years ago led to race riots in which hundreds of people were killed. "It's more than sufficient," he said. Opposition parties say the short campaigning period suits the ruling Barisan Nasional (United Front) coalition, which has governed in various forms since independence in 1957. With the mainstream media all pro-government, the opposition complains it has too little time to reach voters through campaign rallies and house calls, the main means available to them.
