<TITLE> Boy's family files malpractice complaint against doctors </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com)The family of a six-year-old boy filed a complaint with police Wednesday alleging he had been a victim of malpractice in a Mirpur hospital. Naimur Rahman Nahin was operated on by two doctors at Mirpur General Hospital a week ago after he complained of abdominal pain, his uncle Md Samaur Rahman said. Dr Atiar Rahman and Dr Rifat operated on him at the hospital, saying that he was suffering from appendicitis, Samaur said. But his condition deteriorated fast after the surgery. Nahin ended up at the Intensive Care Unit of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Medical University Hospital. Samaur said Nahin's family filed a general diary (GD) complaint with Kafrul Police Station accusing the two doctors of administering wrong treatment to the boy. Nahin was taken to Mirpur General Hospital on Feb 6 where the doctors removed the appendix. They advised the family to take Nahin to Millennium Heart and General Hospital after his condition deteriorated. After five days there, he was shifted to the BSMMU for better treatment. Samaur wrote in his GD complaint filed with the police: "I think the doctors while treating Nahin at Mirpur General Hospital dealt with the patient negligently, or made some mistakes in giving anesthesia to Nahin before the operation, which led to worsening the patient's condition after the operation." "The doctors mishandled the operation," Samaur claimed. "When we contacted the surgeons to tell them about the patient's deteriorating condition, they did not pay proper heed to our concerns," the boy's uncle wrote. "To me, it's the surgeons' failure or negligence that has led to the child's sufferings. We'll not, however, file a case now in this regard." Nahin's cousin AKM Faisal said that Nahin's mother heard her son cry in pain in the middle of the operation. "My aunt saw a person cover Nahin's mouth to muffle the sound of cries from the OT, and three others grab his hands and legs to stop him moving." Faisal claimed that the "whole thing" unfolded before Nahin's mother when she was standing at the door of the operating theatre. "The doctors asked my aunt to go away. They then operated on Nahin for about three hours. The doctors didn't say a word after they came out of the OT," he said. After some hours, they advised Nahin's family to shift him to another hospital with ICU facilities, Faisal said. About the complaint of medical malpractice, Dr Atiar told bdnews24.com: "Nahin is now at the BSMMU. I visit him at least twice a day." "Other doctors are also seeing him; a medical board has been formed for him." "Every procedure has its hazards. We are not responsible for that," said Dr Atiar, an assistant professor at BSMMU. "You better talk to the ICU chairman, Prof Shafiqur Rahman," he suggested. Dr Rifat, who practices at BIRDEM as well as Mirpur General, told bdnews24.com: "The ICU chairman has asked me for a written explanation for what happened during Nahin's operation." "I will file my explanation tomorrow (Thursday). You better wait for that." bdnews24.com
