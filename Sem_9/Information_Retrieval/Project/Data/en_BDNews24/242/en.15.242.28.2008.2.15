 DUBLIN, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ireland plans to hold its referendum on the European Union's reform treaty on May 29, senior government officials said on Friday. A "no" vote in Ireland, the only one of the EU's 27 member states planning a referendum on the treaty, could topple the whole project designed to end years of wrangling over reform of the bloc's institutions. Two recent opinion polls have shown that between 62 and 72 percent of Irish voters are undecided on how they will vote on the treaty, which replaces the EU constitution rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005. The officials, who asked not to be named, said the date was provisionally agreed upon at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday. Last week Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said voters would go to the polls at the end of May or towards the middle of June. "It's very much full steam ahead after Tuesday's meeting with May 29 now the likely, or certainly the preferred date," one official told Reuters. The date would be finalised following discussions between Ireland's Europe Minister Dick Roche and the main, pro-treaty opposition parties, Fine Gael and Labour, the official added. "It looks like we can get agreement on the final wording of the bill and have it approved by cabinet within the next ten days. Both the Labour Party and Fine Gael have been very constructive so far," another official said. The Irish Times newspaper reported on Thursday that the vote would probably take place on either May 29 or June 5 but a third government source said the earlier date looked most likely. "There's no formal date set but our understanding internally is that it will be May 29th," the source said. "The smart money is certainly on that date." A number of senior Fine Gael members of parliament have also indicated their preference to hold the vote on May 29. The final draft of the referendum bill would probably be approved by the cabinet towards the end of this month, the source added. It will then be debated soon after by the lower house of parliament, known as the Dail. The EU treaty will give the bloc a long-term president, a more powerful foreign policy chief, more democratic decision making and more say for European and national parliaments. In 2001, Irish voters rejected the Nice Treaty designed to enable EU enlargement, forcing the government to hold a second referendum that was widely criticised as undemocratic. A second vote is unlikely to be an option in 2008
