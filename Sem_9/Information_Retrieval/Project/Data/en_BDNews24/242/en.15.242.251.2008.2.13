<TITLE> Iraq lawmakers pass key budget and amnesty laws </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Baghdad, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraqi lawmakers achieved a major breakthrough on Wednesday, passing the 2008 budget after weeks of delays and an amnesty law that could lead to the release of thousands of prisoners from the country's jails. MPs also passed a law on provincial powers that will define the relationship between Baghdad and local authorities. Iraqi officials say it is needed to allow provincial polls to be held, possibly in late 2008. Scores of lawmakers stormed out of the legislature on Tuesday, blocking a vote on the bills in a sign of the distrust between the country's Shi'ite, Sunni Arab and Kurdish politicians. Some MPs said parliament should be disbanded and new elections held. "We have proven today that Iraqis are just one bloc," parliament speaker Mahmoud Mashhadani told a news conference to announce the laws had been passed. Lawmakers spent weeks wrangling bitterly over the level of spending on the largely autonomous Kurdish region. Some Shi'ite and Sunni Arab lawmakers had said Kurdistan should get less money based on current population estimates. Officials had said the prolonged delay in approving the budget was holding up vital spending at a time when the United States is urging the government to jumpstart the economy to take advantage of falls in violence. The amnesty law could free thousands of prisoners in Iraqi custody, a move that might secure the return of the main Sunni Arab bloc to the Shi'ite-led government. The Accordance Front has long demanded the release of security detainees. U.S. forces and Iraqi authorities each hold more than 23,000 prisoners, many from the minority Sunni Arab community behind an insurgency against the American-backed government that erupted after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003. The number of inmates soared last year during major military offensives. The Accordance Front quit the cabinet in August in protest at the policies of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. The government has said prisoners under investigation, on trial or convicted could be eligible to be freed. The pardon would exclude those sentenced to death or convicted of killings, terrorism, kidnapping, drugs offenses or corruption, and would cover prisoners held by Iraq but not detainees in U.S. custody.
