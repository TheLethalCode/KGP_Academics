 KHAR, Pakistan, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A roadside bomb blast ripped through a paramilitary vehicle in a northwestern Pakistani tribal region on Thursday, killing three soldiers and wounding one, the military said. The troops were returning in a convoy from a checkpost when the improvised device exploded near Khar, the main town in the Bajaur region on the Afghan border, which is regarded as a safe haven for al Qaeda-linked militants. The attack comes days ahead of a Feb. 18 general election and follows a litany of similar attacks blamed on al Qaeda and Taliban insurgents. More than 400 people have been killed in clashes between troops and militants in bomb and suicide attacks so far this year. One official said the bomb used in Thursday's attack was detonated by remote control. At least 24 people have been killed and more than 30 wounded in bomb attacks on political workers in the past week alone, including two who died in an attack on an election campaign convoy in northwestern Swat valley on Wednesday. Many al Qaeda and Taliban members took refuge on the Pakistani side of the Afghan border after a U.S.-led military invasion toppled the Taliban government in late 2001. Bajaur and South and North Waziristan, the two regions that lie at the southern end of the tribal belt, are regarded as militant safehavens among Pakistan's seven semi-autonomous Federally Administered Tribal Areas. Violence has escalated in Pakistan in the run-up to the election, which was originally due to be held on Jan. 8 but was delayed after the assassination of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto in a gun and suicide bomb attack on Dec. 27. The United States said on Wednesday it was concerned about intensifying violence in the run-up to Monday's poll, which is meant to complete a transition to civilian rule in its ally in its 'war on terror'.
