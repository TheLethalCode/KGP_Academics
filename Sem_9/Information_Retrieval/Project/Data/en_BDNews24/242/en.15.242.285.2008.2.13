 London, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -Better-than-expected US retail sales data set Wall Street on track for a strong open and wiped out stocks losses in Europe on Wednesday, easing some investor concerns about the US economy falling into recession. The dollar strengthened and demand for US and euro zone government bonds eased as the data lowered the chances of US interest rate cuts. The Commerce Department said sales at U.S. retailers rose 0.3 percent in January following a 0.4 percent decline in December. Analysts had forecast a 0.2 percent decline. Investors have been concerned about a weakening consumer sector, which accounts for more than two thirds of the U.S. economy. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares, was up 0.1 percent after spending most of the session in negative territory.
