 JAKARTA, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indonesia's central bank governor, named by the country's anti-graft body as a suspect in a corruption case, said on Friday he would let the investigation take its course and hoped for a quick and fair result. The Corruption Eradication Commission said last month that three senior central bank officials, including the governor, Burhanuddin Abdullah, were suspects in a case where a foundation linked to Bank Indonesia illegally paid members of parliament and funded legal assistance for top central bank officials. Two of the central bank officials, but not Abdullah, were detained by the anti-corruption agency on Thursday evening following questioning. A spokesman for the agency said it expects to question Abdullah next week. Abdullah, who appeared weary and subdued in an interview with Reuters on Friday, said he would follow the procedures and planned to prove his innocence. "It's very human if you are worried," he said. "Let the process be followed. I'll follow the process and we'll see the end of the game." He said the investigation had taken its toll on him personally and on the central bank. "The level of comfort of working has been reduced because of this issue, for me as a person, for me as head of (a) family, for me as governor, and also for Bank Indonesia as an institution." Abdullah, 50, has spent almost his entire career at Bank Indonesia and is nearing the end of his five-year term as governor. Earlier this week, he said he would not stand for a second term, but he told Reuters he plans to prove his innocence. "Yes, I mentioned that I was shocked. I was surprised. I was kind of sad," he said, adding: "I have to get back to common sense so that I can prove... in due time that I am not guilty." Abdullah declined to talk specifically about the investigation. "I don't want to influence the course" of the investigation, he said. "I'll try to follow and to be a law-abiding citizen." During his term, he said, he and his colleagues had helped to restore macroeconomic stability in Indonesia, as shown by the fact the currency had stabilised, interest rates were favourable, and foreign exchange reserves had doubled. COLLAPSE Indonesia's banking and corporate sectors collapsed during the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis, as many banks had ignored the most basic lending regulations and firms borrowed heavily in foreign currencies only to see the value of those debts soar when the rupiah currency plunged. Anwar Nasution, an economist, once famously referred to Bank Indonesia as a "den of thieves", although he later joined the central bank, which underwent various reforms following the 1997-98 financial crisis. Nasution now heads the Supreme Audit Agency that initially investigated the payments by the central bank foundation to members of parliament. Some have speculated he might be asked to return to the bank. Over the past decade, various institutions in Indonesia have investigated the central bank, mainly focusing on its controversial role in a massive bail-out of the banking sector during and after the 1997-98 crisis. The previous central bank governor, Sjahril Sabirin, was sentenced to three years in jail over a banking scandal by a lower Jakarta court in 2002. A higher court overturned the conviction. The scandal erupted in 1999 over a 546 billion rupiah (then $70 million) fee PT Bank Bali paid to a firm which had links to the Golkar party to recover interbank claims extended during the economic crisis. The two officials detained in the current investigation of the central bank are Rusli Simanjuntak, head of the central bank's office in Surabaya, and Oey Hoey Tiong, Bank Indonesia's director for legal affairs. Experts consistently rate Indonesia as among the world's most corrupt nations and foreign executives cite graft as a key factor hurting attempts to attract badly needed investment. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono won the first direct presidential vote in October 2004 on a pledge to end corruption. Since Yudhoyono's anti-graft campaign started, officials ranging from governors and former ministers have been jailed on corruption charges. But critics argue the anti-graft campaign has not taken on some powerful vested interests
