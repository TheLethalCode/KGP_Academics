 Dhaka, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com)DCC ward commissioners continue to press for a formal judicial enquiry into the circumstances surrounding the death of fellow commissioner Qayyum Khan. At the 12th general meeting of Dhaka City Corporation, held at Nagar Bhaban Thursday, Dhaka mayor Sadeque Hossain Khoka termed the arrest of Qayyum "surprising". Mayor Khoka said: "Qayyum was an honest and dedicated social worker." "Qayyum's arrest was a surprise to me from the very beginning." "We'll urge the government through the local government ministry to form a comprehensive probe committee with members both from the judiciary and the administration," he said. The city's ward commissioners expressing concern about the controversial circumstances surrounding Qayyum's death, have since been demanding a judicial probe into the incident. Detained Kafrul ward commissioner Md Qayyum Khan died on Feb 8. Prison authorities said he suffered a stroke at Dhaka Central Jail where he had been detained for over a year. He was taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital where the duty doctors at the emergency room declared him dead. Deputy inspector general of prisons Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui said that the ward commissioner had been ailing for some time. "He fell to the floor unconscious as he went to the bathroom in the morning," Siddiqui said . Prison authorities formed a three-member probe committee the day after Qayyum's death. Members of Qayyum's family said the circumstances which led to Qayyum's death, "without proper medical treatment while in detention, must be investigated thoroughly". Police arrested Qayyum on Jan 13, 2007, on charges of breaching emergency powers rules. The commissioner was freed on bail on Jan 10, 2008, only to be re-arrested the following day for breaching EPR in a case filed against him with Kafrul police station. Mentioning the latter circumstances, Khoka said: "People should know who or which organisation had ordered his detention and in what circumstances he died." Earlier in the meeting, several ward commissioners said they could not accept Qayyum's death as a natural one. They objected to a probe committee "comprising his killers", they said of the three-member committee formed by prison authorities. "The mystery behind the killing must be unearthed and the persons responsible punished," ward commissioner Ferdous Ahmed said. AFM Abdul Alim Muki said: "We feel Qayyum Khan was killed." "This kind of excesses in the name of democracy and development will not be tolerated." In his concluding speech Khoka said: "Now there is no scope for politics in the local government body. There is no approval." He assured the commissioners that he would discuss the matter with the Election Commission and the local government ministry. "We are not accountable to any bureaucrat, any adviser. We are accountable to the people of the area," he said. Mentioning that many commissioners are in detention and many are facing problems, the mayor said: "These problems will be solved through the law. We cannot accept death without any cause or death for lack of treatment in detention." About 100 from among 120 ward commissioners of 90 DCC wards participated in Thursday's meeting. Ward commissioner AFM Abdul Alim Muki told bdnews24.com that 20 ward commissioners were either in detention or on the run. bdnews24.
