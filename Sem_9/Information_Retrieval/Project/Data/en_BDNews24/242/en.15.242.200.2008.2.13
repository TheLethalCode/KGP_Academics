 Dhaka, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com) - The former footballers Wednesday demanded immediate election of the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) in line with the FIFA guideline. The demand came at a press conference, organised by a section of former booters, at the National Sports Council conference room. "A dispute over forming the Football Associations (FAs) at district and divisional levels among the members of the BFF, few organisers and former footballers has made the situation worse and Bangladesh are under threat of the FIFA suspension," said Swadhin Bangla Football Team captain Jakaria Pintu. "To get out of this situation, there is no alternative to election in line with the FIFA guideline," said Pintu adding that if Bangladesh faced the FIFA suspension, then no party could avoid the responsibility. "We don't care who runs the federation. We, however, want to see football in field for 10 months in a calendar year," said Kazi Salahuddin. "There was no football in last 10 months, and who is responsible for this," questioned Salahuddin. In April last, the FIFA directed the BFF to form FAs without the government officials before holding the BFF election by April 2008. The government along with some ogranisers and former players is apparently against the exclusion of the government officials in the FAs. "We also want the government officials in FAs, but we believe a new committee can bring the changes in the FA statutes after discussing the matter with the government, FIFA and AFC," said Ashrafuddin Ahmed Chunnu. Protap Sangkar Hazra, Jahirul Islam, M Ajmot, Shafiqul Islam Manik, Kaiser Hamid, Rummon Bin Sabbir, Jakir Hossain, Imtiaz Ahmed Nakib, Ponir, Atik, Masud Rana, Iqbal Hossain and Titu were among others present on the occasion.
