<TITLE> Chad president appoints ally as defence minister </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 N'DJAMENA, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chad's president, Idriss Deby, appointed a close ally as defence minister on Friday, hours after declaring a state of emergency following a rebel attack on the capital N'Djamena this month. Deby appointed Mahamat Ali Abdallah Nassour, previously mines and energy minister, as his new defence minister, according to a decree read on state radio. Nassour effectively took joint control of military operations in Chad with Deby after armed forces chief of staff Gen. Daoud Soumaine Khalil was killed in fighting outside N'Djamena on Feb. 1 as the rebels advanced on the capital. Nassour, a member of Deby's Zaghawa ethnic group, also acted as the visible head of government in the tense hours when the president was holed up in his palace during two days of fighting in the city during the Feb. 2-3 assault. Chad had been without an official defence minister since the sacking in December of Mahamat Nour Abdelkerim, a former anti-Deby rebel chief who made peace with the government. He was dismissed over doubts that his men were loyal to Deby. The lighting assault on N'Djamena by a convoy of 3,000 rebel fighters this month was repelled in street fighting that killed more than 160 people. The rebels have since withdrawn to the remote eastern border region with Sudan's Darfur region. Deby decreed a state of emergency late on Thursday across the central African state, giving the government exceptional powers for 15 days that include travel restrictions, a midnight-to-dusk curfew and media censorship
