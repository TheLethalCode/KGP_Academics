 Dhaka, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com)--Sheikh Hasina did not appear Wednesday as scheduled before the Special Judges' Court set up on the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban premises. Updates with changes The former prime minister reportedly remained unwell after falling sick Monday. Judge Md Firoz Alam arrived in the court room around 10.30 am Wednesday to resume proceedings of a corruption case against Hasina involving illegally awarded contracts to set up barge mounted power plants. Referring to the Feb 6 High Court verdict that quashed a separate extortion case against Hasina after ruling illegal its transfer under emergency powers rules, Hasina's lawyers said the present case should be dismissed since it had also been transferred under EPR. The defence further asked the court to release Hasina "She is suffering from a number of medical complications including headaches, eye ailments and high blood pressure. She should be freed," they said. The prosecution lawyers argued against such a course of action. The court will continue hearing of the case on Feb 19. On Feb 7 the special judge's court had deferred the hearing after the prosecution lawyers appealed for more time. On Tuesday, the Appellate Division upheld the High Court's earlier bail order for former power secretary Toufique-e-Elahi Chowdhury who was also accused in the case. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case with Tejgaon Police Station on Sept 2 last year. Other accused alongside Hasina and Toufique are: former chairman of the Power Development Board Nuruddin Mahmud Kamal, Summit Group directors Md Aziz Khan and Farid Khan, United Group directors Hasan Mahmud Raja and Abul Kalam Azad and curator of the Bangabandhu Memorial Trust Syed Siddikur Rahman. According to case details, the accused accepted bribes of around Tk 3 crore in exchange for awarding contracts to two companies to set up three barge-mounted power plants at Haripur, Shikalbaha and Khulna. The case alleged that the former prime minister purchased 19 kathas of land, including a two-storey building on Road No 32, Dhanmondi, in the name of the Bangabandhu Memorial Trust in 1997. The owners of Summit Group and United Group were involved in the land deal payment. The police pressed charges on Jan 10, adding the curator of the Bangabandhu Memorial Trust to the list of accused in the charge-sheet. On Nov 4, the High Court stayed all proceedings of the case after Hasina had challenged the legality of bringing the case under emergency powers rules. The Supreme Court overturned the High Court order on Nov 26, clearing the way for the proceedings to continue to trial. bdnews24.co
