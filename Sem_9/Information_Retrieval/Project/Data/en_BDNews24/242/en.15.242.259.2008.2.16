<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 16 (bdnews245.com)  Awami League acting president Zillur Rahman has seriously questioned law adviser AF Hassan Ariff's recent comment that the next polls could be held amid the state of emergency. Zillur said Saturday that the adviser's comment was "unexpected". "We are shocked and astonished by the comment by the law adviser when the chief adviser favours lifting the state of emergency for elections," Zillur told reporters after the party's presidium members met at his Gulshan home. "We did not expect such a comment from him." The law adviser at a news briefing on Thursday said that there was no obstacle to holding the polls amid the state of emergency. But, the adviser said, the emergency should be relaxed since it does not allow the holding of processions or any political gathering. Presidium members Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, Amir Hossain Amu, Tofail Ahmed, Motia Chowdhury, Kazi Zafrullah, and acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam attended the meeting with the acting party president. Zillur, however, would not say anything about the meeting details. "There's no formal meeting actually. They just came to see me," he said. About Hasina's reported illness, he said: "Her condition is very bad. America is the best place for her treatment. We will take our steps if the government allows her to go to America." About the authorities' explanation that a detainee cannot be allowed overseas for treatment, Zillur said: "Rab (ASM Abdur Rab, leader of a Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal faction) had been sent abroad for treatment during his detention." He would not elaborate. Meanwhile, Tofail Ahmed said AL decided on Saturday that the presidium would hold a meeting on Feb 22 while the party's central working committee would sit on Feb 24. On the second spell of dialogues with the Election Commission that is set to begin on Feb 24, Tofail said he appreciated the move by the commission. "It's a good decision by the commission to sit with the political parties for a second time." He said they would discuss matters that remained unsolved during the party's previous dialogue with the commission. On whether the Awami League would place a common agenda after discussion with its allies, Tofail said: "We will place common proposals to the Election Commission." He said they would ask the commission not to create any uncertainty over the next electins by wasting time. "We will say it will not be right to waste time. The commission has said that it has prepared a draft proposal (for electoral reforms). We have also prepared one." Later, a delegation of the party's Australia branch met Zillur and handed over Australian dollars equivalent to Tk 1.5 lakh in party funds. bd
