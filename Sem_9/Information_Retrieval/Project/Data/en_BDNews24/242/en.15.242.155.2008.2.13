 Islamabad, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan successfully test fired a short-range nuclear-capable missile on Wednesday as part of its efforts to boost its defence capabilities, the military said. Pakistan also tested long and medium range ballistic missiles in the past month. Prime Minister Mohammadmian Soomro watched the test firing of the Ghaznavi (Hatf III) ballistic missile, which can travel up to 300 km (185 miles), at an undisclosed location. Soomro, whose caretaker premiership will come to an end after an election set for Feb. 18, said Pakistan stood for peace but could not overlook its defence needs. "Peace comes from strength whereas weakness invites aggression," a military statement quoted him as saying. Pakistan carried out nuclear tests in May 1998, days after its old rival India conducted tests. The two South Asian neighbours, which have fought three wars since their independence from British rule 60 years ago, regularly carry out missile tests despite a peace process they launched in early 2004
