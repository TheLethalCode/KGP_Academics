<TITLE> SA looks for a successful series against Bangladesh: Smith </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com)  South Africa are looking forward to another successful series against hosts Bangladesh, said Proteas captain Graeme Smith. "We had a good tour in Bangladesh before and we are looking forward to another laurel this time," Smith told reporters on arrival at Zia International Airport Thursday. The Proteas will play three ODIs and two Tests in their second full series in Bangladesh, who first hosted them in 2003. "We have come rounding off a very successful home series against the West Indies. We made this trip to Bangladesh amid a lot of rushed activities, but it's very important for all of us too," said the opener. South Africa whitewashed the West Indies in five-ODI series a few days back and clinched the three Tests series 2-1 after going down against the West Indies in the first Test at home. Bangladesh thrashed South Africa once in an ODI they had played against them, but conceded innings defeat in all four Tests. The 27-year old skipper also promised to showcase good cricket that would draw the admiration of the Bangladeshis. "We got some wonderful players and I hope we play a brand of cricket that Bangladeshi people will enjoy watching." South Africa will open their month-long tour with a warm-up three-dayer, scheduled for Feb 17-19 at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium before taking on hosts in the first Test at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium (SBNS) from Feb 22. Smith, however, seemed serious about fixing some acclimatisation issues first. "We surely have to sort out and work on a few things here like getting used to the climate and playing conditions here." Smith, however, warned that they are used to playing cricket under all conditions against any team. Asked whether they are expecting the same sort of challenge from the Tigers as had happened in the ICC World Cup in the West Indies, Smith said, "We always respect our opponents. Obviously, they will get more respect in their home condition." The left-handed batsman, however, reminded reporters that their confidence level was high after having played some series of late. "The confidence is good as we played a couple of good series in Pakistan, New Zealand and the West Indies at home," said Smith. The South Africa captain didn't consider Bangladesh easy opponents in Test series despite Bangladesh's poor Test statistics. Asked whether the dispute over selecting the South African squad for Bangladesh tour would affect their performance, Smith said, "We are really concentrating on cricket and once we get together, we'll concentrate only on cricket." "There are some pressure on individuals to perform here, but the issue will not knuckle us down," said the Proteas captain. The second and final Test will be held on Feb 29-March 4 at Birshreshtha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium in Chittagong, which will also host the first one-dayer on March 9. The second and third one-dayers are slotted for March 12 and 14 at the SBNS in Dhaka. bdnew
