 ANKARA, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israel does not consider Turkey a potential springboard for any future attack on neighbouring Syria or Iran, a senior Israeli defence official said on Wednesday during a visit to Ankara. Muslim but secular Turkey is the Jewish state's most important regional ally and the two carry out regular joint air force and other military drills. But ties were tested last year after Turkey complained at Israel's violation of its airspace during a mysterious bombing run in northern Syria.

"We have been playing the role of facilitator between Syria and Israel and are willing to do all we can in order to ease the problem," he said. Israel, which is believed to have the Middle East's only atomic arsenal, has vowed to prevent its enemies from acquiring the capability to threaten its existence. Iran says that its nuclear programme has no hostile designs but its president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has stoked regional war fears by calling for Israel to be "wiped off the ma
