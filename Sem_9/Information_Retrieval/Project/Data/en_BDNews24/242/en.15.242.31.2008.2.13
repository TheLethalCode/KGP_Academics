 Dhaka, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com)The University Grants Commission's annual report has called for universities to kit their libraries with digital systems and ensure well-equipped laboratories are available to students. The report, which was recently submitted to the president, has also recommended making a UGC website with links to all university websites in the country. "Bangladesh will have to implement these initiatives if we are to survive in the fast-paced age of science and technology," the report said. Prof Nazrul Islam, the UGC chairman, told bdnews24.com Wednesday: "We have already started working on some of the report's recommendations." "Some universities already have links to our website, although I hope more will follow," he said. The report said a comprehensive network of universities should be established, with the UGC maintaining a coordinating role. bdnews2
