<TITLE> Good EU trade terms no panacea for West Africa </TITLE>

 ABUJA, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - West Africa should approach trade talks with Europe as a way to boost its industry rather than focusing on preferential trade terms for raw materials, a top negotiator for the region said on Wednesday. The West African bloc is one of six regional groupings of mainly poor former colonies around the world that benefited from preferential trade terms with Europe that expired at the end of last year. The European Union had hoped to sign an economic partnership agreement (EPA) with the bloc before the deadline but this failed to happen, with each side blaming the other. The bloc has set itself a new target to reach an EPA by mid-2009. Cocoa and banana growers Ivory Coast and Ghana broke ranks with their partners from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and made last-minute bilateral deals to safeguard advantageous terms for their key exports. Ablasse Ouedraogo, special adviser to ECOWAS Commission President Mohamed Ibn Chambas, said West Africa's long-term interest did not rest in preferential trade terms for raw materials but in improving its infrastructure and industry. "Europe must help exporters of raw materials to start transforming their goods or Africa will forever remain a provider of raw materials and a market for imported consumer goods," he told Reuters in an interview in Abuja, where ECOWAS is based. "An EPA is not only about trade, it is also about real development. West Africa should be looking to Europe for financial and technical support for improving its productive capacity," he said. INTEGRATION Ouedraogo also said West African countries, which include some of the poorest in the world such as Sierra Leone, Liberia and Niger, had more to gain in the long term from trading with each other than with Europe. He argued that in the age of cheap Chinese goods, West African countries struggling with major infrastructure problems such as a dearth of electricity had little prospects of ever being competitive exporters of finished goods to Europe. However, there was a future in smaller scale industries in goods such as plastics or clothing that would find markets within the sub-region, he said, citing Ivory Coast and Nigeria as examples of countries already exporting to their neighbours. "What Africa needs from Europe is support for real development and that will come through regional integration," he said. "The strategy of pushing Ghana and Ivory Coast to break their regional commitments to take on new ones towards Europe is damaging to West Africa's efforts to integrate." However, Ouedraogo said the damage was not irreparable. He said experts and ministers from Ghana and Ivory Coast were due to take part in talks with the other members of the West African bloc on the EPA issue in Mauritania from Feb. 18 to 21. Ouedraogo said the expiry of the preferential trade terms would not have significant consequences for most bloc members. All but four of the West African countries are so poor that they benefit from the Everything But Arms initiative which means they still enjoy preferential export terms. The other four are Ghana and Ivory Coast, which have protected themselves for now, Cape Verde which only just emerged from the poorest bracket on Jan. 1 this year and has a three-year grace period, and Nigeria, a major oil export
