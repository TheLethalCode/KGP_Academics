 Dhaka, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com)India must feed own people first, said the country's high commissioner to Bangladesh Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty Thursday. "Against the backdrop of rising rice prices on the global market, India decided to ban exports of rice priced below $500 per tonne," Chakravarty told reporters after his meeting with home affairs adviser MA Matin. "But India will export five lakh tonnes of rice to Bangladesh aloneto honour its past commitments." Asked if friendly ties between Bangladesh and India would be strained because of the recent ban on exports of low-priced rice, the envoy said: "The Indian government took the decision to ensure food security for its people. That should not spoil the relationship between the two neighbours." "Do you think we should export rice without catering to our own people?" Chakravarty said. Talking about his meeting with the home affairs adviser, he said, "We also discussed rice exports and relevant political and economic issues among other things." "We want Bangladesh to hold a free and fair election and the present government is working towards it. We expect the government to hold the polls as forecast in the election roadmap and revive democratic governance," he said. The envoy also responded to questions on the Indian government's alleged failure to implement its commitments to assist Bangladesh in post-disaster situations through 2004-2008. "We've started implementing our commitments. All committed aid will reach Bangladesh in phases, depending on our budget allocations and stocks of commodities at home." Earlier in the day, Chakravarty paid a courtesy visit to cultural affairs adviser Rasheda K Choudhury in her office before meeting Matin. bdnews24
