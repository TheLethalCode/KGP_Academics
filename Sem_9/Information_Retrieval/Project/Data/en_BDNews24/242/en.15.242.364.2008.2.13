 Aasa Christine Stoltz and Camilla Bergsli Oslo, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Telenor posted a bigger-than-expected 11.6 percent drop in fourth-quarter core earnings Wednesday, partly due to its Norwegian operations, sending its shares down more than 6 percent. The Nordic region's second-largest phone operator said 2008 revenue would grow by about 6 percent, including its deconsolidated but majority-owned Ukrainian unit Kyivstar, down from about 15 percent growth in 2007 from 2006. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) fell to 7.25 billion crowns ($1.32 billion) in the October to December period from 8.19 billion a year earlier. The fall was sharper than the average forecast for a 9 percent fall to 7.44 billion crowns in a Reuters poll of 16 analysts whose estimates ranged from 7.23 billion to 7.86 billion crowns. "The new guidance is a bit below what the market had hoped for, but I think it is a realistic guidance," DnB NOR analyst Frank Maaoe said. Shares in Telenor fell 4.8 percent to 104 crowns by 1024 GMT, underperforming a 0.6 percent drop in the benchmark index , valuing the company at about $31.5 billion. The European telecom sector fell 1.1 percent. Telenor's sub-par results come after Sweden's TeliaSonera, the Nordics's biggest telephone group, missed fourth quarter forecasts and announced staff cuts. Telenor expects an EBITDA margin before other income and expenses above 31 percent and capital expenditure at about 20 percent of revenues in 2008, driven by high subscription growth in mobile operations in emerging markets. Mobile telephony is Telenor's main growth driver, which has mobile operations in 13 countries in Europe and Asia. "We feel that we have capacity to look at other areas, and Asia and Africa is a part of that," Chief Executive Jon Fredrik Baksaas said when asked about possible new markets. Telenor said it saw continued high customer growth in Asia, particularly in Pakistan where it added 2 million subscribers in the quarter and has a market share of 19 percent. COST CUTS Telenor said it would implement efficiency measures in its Norway mobile unit after the EBITDA margin fell 10 percentage points to 31.1 percent in the fourth quarter, due mainly to a loss in wholesale revenues, price reductions and increased costs. "We will cut costs by 500 million crowns during 2008," Baksaas told a news conference, adding that it aims to stabilise the unit's EBITDA margin in the mid-30 percent range. Telenor's market share in Norway remained unchanged at 53 percent. The group's total mobile subscriptions grew by 30 million in 2007 to a total of 143 million, "ranking Telenor as the world's 7th largest mobile operator", Baksaas said in a statement, behind China Mobile, China Unicom, Britain's Vodafone, Spain's Telefonica and Sintel and America Movil. The results were hit partly by the deconsolidation of Telenor's Ukrainian unit Kyivstar from early 2007 due to a battle for control with Russian co-owner Alfa Group. Telenor deconsolidated Kyivstar due to insufficient control over the group after numerous courtroom battles with Alfa. It regained access to unaudited financial results of the 56.5 percent-owned unit in December but has not reconsolidated it. Pretax profit, including Kyivstar, rose to 7.24 billion crowns, against an average forecast of 7.69 billion crowns and up from 5.90 billion in the same period a year ago. Telenor also said it would most likely hold an initial public offering for its Bangladeshi unit Grameenphone over the course of 2008, in which it has 62 percent.
