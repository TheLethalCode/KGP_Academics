<TEXT>
 Feb 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police raided the home and offices of Klaus Zumwinkel, Chief Executive of German postal and logistics group Deutsche Post, on Thursday and a source told Reuters he was being investigated for tax evasion. The image of corporate Germany has taken a beating in the past few years due to a series of scandals, ranging from corruption and bribery allegations to controversies over large executive payouts and golden handshakes. Following are a few examples: Top managers and labour bosses from VW, Europe's biggest carmaker, have been accused of conspiring to bilk the firm of funds to pay for sex trips as part of an institutionalised system of bribery put in place under VW's former personnel boss, Peter Hartz. Last year, a court handed Hartz -- who advised former chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on labour market reforms -- a two-year suspended sentence and a fine of 576,000 euros. Former VW works council head Klaus Volkert is charged with incitement to breach of trust. Once a powerful VW figure who stepped down when the affair came to light, he is accused of soliciting nearly 2 million euros in company funds for personal gain. He denies he put his employer up to the payments. A court is due to reach a verdict in March. DEUTSCHE BANK CHIEF EXECUTIVE JOSEF ACKERMANN Germany's best-known banker, Josef Ackermann faced trial for agreeing windfall bonuses to departing managers of telecoms firm Mannesmann. In 2006, a court approved a settlement under which he would make a 3.2 million euros payment to charity but not admit to any wrongdoing. Ackermann and five co-defendants, who sat on Mannesmann's non-executive board, had approved large bonuses for departing managers of the firm after it was bought by Britain's Vodafone. During a first trial, Ackermann had told Germany to "wake up" to the reality of bonuses, such as those paid to Mannesmann executives. He sparked much public criticism after he was pictured smiling and showing the V-for-victory sign. FORMER MANNESMANN CHIEF EXECUTIVE KLAUS ESSER Klaus Esser and others received golden handshakes that Ackermann approved. Under the settlement, Esser had to pay 1.5 million euros, part of which would go to charity. DAIMLER'S FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE JUERGEN SCHREMPP Juergen Schrempp sparked fierce media criticism when he walked away with millions in a pay-off and stock options in 2005 as his merger with U.S. automaker Chrysler unravelled. Daimler ditched Chrysler after a nine-year marriage that never lived up to its billing as the perfect automotive match. SIEMENS The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Siemens are investigating whether employees of Siemens, Germany's biggest corporate employer and one of the world's largest electrical and engineering groups, paid hundreds of millions of euros in bribes for contracts. The scandal has led to the resignation of Klaus Kleinfeld, who was chief executive, and Heinrich von Pierer, who was chairman. Neither has been accused of wrongdoing. TUI German prosecutors have charged TUI Chief Financial Officer Rainer Feuerhake with breach of trust relating to the collapse of engineering firm Babcock Borsig. Travel and shipping group TUI has said Feuerhake has not committed any cri
