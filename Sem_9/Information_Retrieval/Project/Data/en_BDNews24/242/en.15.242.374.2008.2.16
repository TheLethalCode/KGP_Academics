 Dhaka, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com)  Former national footballer Monwar Hossain Nannu died Saturday morning, at the age of 59, and was buried at Mirpur Martyred Intellectuals' Graveyard just before maghrib prayers. Relatives said he died at about 8.30am on the way to Apollo Hospital in the city. Nannu, a member of Bangladesh's first national football team, was suffering from cancer. The renowned footballer played for reputed clubs including Abahani Limited and Mohammedan Sporting Club. He was known as 'Abahoni's Nannu' to his fans for his long service to the club from 1974 through to 1982. Although Nannu started his career as a centre forward he discovered his true potential in defence, becoming a star for his glamour, performance and leadership on the pitch. Nannu's younger brother Monju played for perennial rivals Mohammedan Sporting Club. Both brothers led their own teams in defensive roles. According to many, the Abahani-Mohammedan derby gave life to domestic football during its heyday in the 1980s. Nannu joined Rahmatganj Muslim Friends Society in 1983, which proved to be the veteran player's last year on the pitch. The following year he returned to his beloved Abahani, although not as a player, recalled former club official and ex-lawmaker Harunur Rashid Saturday. The footballing veteran usually proved to be a pivotal player for Abahani and was often involved in match winning plays, Harunur said. Nannu was also a key player in many important international matches both at home and abroad including the Aga Khan Gold Cup and Mardeka Cup. His first namaj-e-janaza was held Saturday afternoon at Bangabandhu National Stadium. The coffin was then taken to Sonali Otit for about half an hour for people to pay their last respects. The second janaza was held at the grounds of Abahani Limited. The coffin was taken to Mirpur Martyred Intellectuals' Graveyard, where the late footballing hero was buried just before maghrib prayers. bdnews24.com/s
