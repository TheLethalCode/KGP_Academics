"The grenades we recovered Friday night are identical with the grenades of August 21," RAB director general Hasan Mahmud Khandaker told the press briefing at the battalion's headquarters in Uttara. However, the Satkhira grenades were of recent manufacture, he said. Two peopleMufti Mainuddin Sheikh, alias Abu Jandal, and accomplice Nazrul Islam Ghoramiwere earlier arrested with alleged links to the recovered grenades, police and RAB officials said. Both are senior figures of banned Islamist outfit Harkatul Jihad. The militant group has been accused of carrying out the Aug 21 grenade attack targeting Sheikh Hasina during an AL rally in 2004. Party secretary Ivy Rahman was among those who died in the attack. Based on information from Jandal, who was arrested on Feb 14 from Gazipur, RAB seized 41 grenades Friday at Shimulia village in Debhata, Satkhira.
