 GENEVA, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fifteen governments have put up candidates to take over the leadership of the United Nations' patent agency WIPO later this year from its outgoing Sudanese chief Kamal Idris, WIPO said.

Outsiders include Jorge Amigo, director of the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, Pakistan's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Masood Khan, and Enrique Manlo of the Philippines, a former chair of the WIPO General Assembly. The other countries to put up candidates are Poland, Bangladesh, Brazil, Macedonia, Italy, Kenya, Slovenia, Russia -- which proposed its intellectual property service chief Boris Simonov -- Japan and Hondur
