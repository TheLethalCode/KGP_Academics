 Dhaka, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com)Law and justice adviser AF Hassan Ariff has said some emergency powers rules have to be relaxed in the buildup to elections. "Whether the state of emergency will be completely withdrawn during elections is quite a different decision," the adviser said in a weekly news briefing Thursday. Replying to a question from the reporters, Hassan Ariff said the emergency powers rules do not bar voting, but ban electioneering, processions and rallies, for which the rules must relax. The adviser said a committee was working on finalising the Right to Information Act. A law ministry representative has been included in the committee. Hassan Ariff said he had seen some sections of the law. The former law adviser was pressed for comment on a reported amendment to a section of the CrPC which empowered the police to arrested suspects using FIR. "I haven't received anything like that," Hassan Ariff said. He said there is no relation between the state of emergency and the army. "The army is assisting the civil administration." On the formation of Human Rights Commission, Hassan Ariff there was no deadline set for that. But he said the caretaker government would form it. bdnews
