 CANBERRA, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka beat India by eight wickets in a rain-shortened one-day international at Manuka Oval on Tuesday to record their first win of the tri-series tournament. Sri Lanka were set a revised target of 154 off 21 overs to win under the Duckworth-Lewis method after India had made 195 for five from their 29 overs. Sri Lanka reached their target with two overs to spare, Tillakaratne Dilshan finishing unbeaten on 62 and captain Mahela Jayawardene not out 36. Both teams were forced to chase quick runs after the start of the match was delayed for more than three and a half hours because of heavy showers. Rohit Sharma smashed a career-best 70 not out from just 64 balls as India's batsmen went on the rampage when the match finally got underway. Sachin Tendulkar (32), captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (31) and the in-form Gautam Gambhir (35) also scored at better than a run-a ball rate in a frantic attempt to make up for lost time. Dhoni and Gambhir were both run out trying to keep the scoreboard ticking along while Lasith Malinga, Nuwan Kulasekera and Farveez Maharoof each took a wicket for Sri Lanka. But spinner Muttiah Muralitharan missed out in his 300th one-day international. Sri Lanka lost opener Sanath Jayasuriya for 27 and wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara for 10 but regained their composure and cruised to victory on the back of an unbroken partnership of 85 between Dilshan and Jayawardene. Australia's east coast has been drenched by torrential downpours over the past two weeks and the first two matches of the triangular series were washed out in Brisbane last week. Only two of the previous matches produced results -- Australia beating Sri Lanka by 128 runs in Sydney last Friday then India upsetting the Australians by five wickets in Melbourne two days late
