<TITLE> No wicket worry for Proteas </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh's intent to restrict South Africa on the low and slow wicket might come to nothing as the Proteas captain said they are much more tranquil in playing spins especially in longer version matches. "I think we are much more comfortable in getting spins, especially in the longer format of the game; players having some experience have done well against spin. I am looking forward to seeing them bowl on this turf," South Africa captain Graeme Smith told reporters at a press conference at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium (SBNS) in Mirpur Friday. "Look, spinners in this condition are always going to be a factor. It's something when you come to a subcontinent, you know like coming to South Africa, Bangladesh have to face the first ball. "It's just a thing to find out a way to play. We have just won a series in Pakistan; you know third team in 27 years to have done so," reminded the 27-year-old captain." Keeping in mind that South Africa faced trouble on a slow and low wicket, Bangladesh seems to be making turning wickets for the visitors in the two- Test series. The Proteas had first net sessions at the SBNS Friday after arriving here Thursday morning and considered conditions to be slightly different from those at home. "I am already in our first net practice and notice things are pretty dry. Looking at the Test wickets, it looks pretty dry. So I think the condition for us is going to be slightly different from what we are used to back in South Africa," said the left-handed opener. "Just going to make some work up front, I think the condition will make the series a lot more neutral," added he. South Africa will open their month-long tour with a warm-up three-dayer, scheduled Feb 17-19 at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium before taking on hosts in the first Test at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium (SBNS) from Feb 22. Despite the absence of explosive Herschelle Gibbs and all-rounder Shaun Pollock, Smith believes they have brought their strongest side. "Every Test series is important for us as we have brought up a wonderful record this season. We won in Pakistan, two wins at home against New Zealand and the West Indies. "You know, on the road it's just show the respect we have for playing in the subcontinent, we know how difficult it can be, especially in the test format. "I think in the one-day format we might probably use a lot of young guys, give them a chance to gain experience, But in the Test format, we really believe that we have got to put in work and do well," said Smith. Asked whether they felt the absence of retired Pollock, Smith said, "It feels different not having Shaun (Pollock) on tour. We used have a man on tour, a face on tour, it obviously we don't have him around. We lost a man with a lot of experience." He also said that it was an opportunity for another young player to find his place on the team. "You can't replace a man with that experience overnight. But, there are wonderful talents in this team and I am sure in time we will get it," hoped the South African captain. Asked about the selection dispute, Smith said, "It's our job to concentrate on cricket and that's what we are doing here. We really want to get away from it." "At the end of the day, our job is to play cricket and we want to do well for South Africa. I mean a lot to represent our country and that's what we really want to show in the next couple of weeks."
