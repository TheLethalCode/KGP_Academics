<TITLE> Dutch up airport security after fake bomb on plane </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Amsterdam, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Dutch government announced plans on Tuesday to tighten security at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport after a journalist smuggled a fake bomb and drugs into planes at Europe's fourth-busiest air travel hub. Three staff entrances will be closed immediately and body searches introduced for all personnel and their belongings within days, Justice Minister Ernst Hirsch Ballin said in a letter to parliament, which had demanded answers after the breach. Investigative journalist Alberto Stegeman managed to smuggle a fake bomb and drugs onto planes using the uniform and identity badge of an associate who secured a job as a baggage handler. He said gate personnel always let uniformed workers into planes. The minister said iris scans would be introduced to staff entrances to the secure parts of the airport by July 1 and two security guards instead of one would conduct identity checks until then. The number of random checks on personnel leaving the airport will also be increased. The minister said he took the breach very seriously but said security at Schiphol airport met European rules and was generally good, adding that it was impossible to rule out that staff with an airport pass could commit crimes.
