 LONDON, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil held below $93 a barrel on Wednesday, as concerns over Venezuela's move to halt shipments to US major Exxon Mobil were offset by an expected build in crude inventories in the world's largest consumer. US crude traded 15 cents lower at $92.63 a barrel by 0925 GMT, while London Brent crude eased 3 cents to $92.83. President Hugo Chavez's decision to cut oil exports to Exxon Mobil on Tuesday came after the largest company in the United States won a court decision freezing $12 billion of Venezuela's overseas assets in a fight for compensation after Chavez seized a heavy oil project last year. "I think these prices reflect some short-covering in the market, but I don't see these conditions as something that will continue long term," said Kaname Gokon, deputy general manager at Okato Shoji Co's research section. Top global oil producers have assured the United States they can make up for a major supply disruption should Venezuela cut exports, a U.S. government official told Reuters on Tuesday. But even if supplies did fall, oil inventories in the United States look healthy. An expanded Reuters poll ahead of Wednesday's U.S. government data showed forecasts for an average 2.7 million barrel build in crude stocks, the fifth consecutive rise. Analysts also forecast a 1.8 million barrel increase in gasoline stocks, while distillates are expected to drop 1.4 million barrels. "If the (EIA) statistics can not bring a break of recent highs, then we should move back to a range trading pattern between $85 and $95," said Olivier Jakob of Petromatrix. After surging to a record high of $100.09 on Jan. 3, oil has traded in a narrow range near $90 a barrel as fears of a US recession weighed on prices. The International Energy Agency cut its world oil demand growth forecast this year due to the economic slowdown in the world's top energy consumer. The IEA, adviser to 27 industrialised countries, forecast in its monthly Oil Market report that global oil demand growth would average 1.67 million barrels per day, down 310,000 bpd from its previous estima
