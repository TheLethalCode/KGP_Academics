<TITLE> At end-2007, Japan quickens, EU flags, US fades </TITLE>

 PARIS/TOKYO, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Economic growth accelerated in Japan and lost half of its previous speed in Europe over the last three months of 2007, when the US economy came close to standstill, official data showed on Thursday. That gave Europe the best growth rate for 2007, followed by the United States, even if Japan finished the strongest out of three major industrialised regions which now have to confront the spectre of US stagnation or recession. Japan's GDP grew 0.9 percent in the three months to the end of December, twice what economists had forecast and three times as much as the previous quarter, leaving GDP growth for 2007 as a whole at 2.1 percent, versus 2.4 percent in 2006. The spurt in late 2007, which analysts said might be a lot better than what is coming next, was driven mostly by corporate investment and exports, primarily of cars and software. It put Japan's growth in 2007 a tenth of a percentage point behind the United States, where GDP is estimated at 2.2 percent, with the difference that Japan put in a sprint finish. US fourth-quarter growth was announced at 0.6 percent by the U.S. Commerce Department. That actually translates to about 0.15 percent quarter-on-quarter when divided by four to make it comparable with the Japanese and European figures. In Europe, GDP growth for the fourth quarter dropped to 0.4 percent in the euro zone from 0.8 in the third quarter, while the rate dropped to 0.5 percent from 0.8 percent for the wider 27-nation European Union, which includes Britain, Sweden and many of the formerly Communist countries of eastern Europe, according to EU statistics office Eurostat. EUROPE LOST STEAM In Europe, largest economy Germany's GDP growth slowed to 0.3 percent compared to the third quarter, when it was 0.7 percent. French GDP growth slowed to 0.3 percent too, from 0.8 in the third quarter. Germany's economy grew 2.5 percent in 2007, short of the 2.9 percent it scored in 2006, a bumper year for the world's top exporting nation, while French GDP growth for 2007 slipped to 1.9 percent from 2.2 in 2006, short of the government's target. "Euro zone growth is in trouble," said David Brown, chief European economist at Bear Stearns International. "Germany and France have suffered a major loss of forward momentum ... Investment growth and exports may be giving growth some short term respite, but this will not last for long if domestic demand begins to fade in a bigger way and the prospect of global slowdown begins to loom larger." Germany and France account for more than 50 percent of the total GDP of the 15-country euro currency zone. Spain, which economists fear is heading for a hiding as a housing and construction boom ends, fared relatively well in the fourth quarter with GDP growth of 0.8 percent, after 0.7 in the third quarter. WHAT NOW? As always, financial markets are more focused on what is about to happen rather than on GDP estimates that see the light of day a month or two after the period concerned. Regarding Japan, some analysts took the good fourth-quarter GDP data as a sign that the export-driven economy has less to fear from weaker US demand than others, but that did not prevent others viewing the future negatively. "If Japanese industrial production falls as expected in January-February, the Japanese economy will surely fall into a recession," said Naoki Murakami, economist at Goldman Sachs. Others said recession fears were overblown however. "Today's data showed the Japanese economy grew even as the US economy slowed down," said Mitsuru Saito, chief economist at Tokai Tokyo Securities. "The US economy may stagnate this year but that is unlikely to have much additional impact on Japan." Japanese exports have so far held up despite the US slowdown, thanks to strong demand from elsewhere in Asia and other emerging economies -- the data showed net exports accounted for almost half of fourth-quarter growth. In Europe, the weaker fourth-quarter performance had been expected. Germany's statistics office provides details only in a few days' time but summarized things as follows: "Growth in the fourth quarter was powered by a further strong increase in equipment investment and by net trade. There were negative impulses from consumption, characterised by falling household spending." In France, the biggest drag on GDP was companies running down inventories but economists said growth in 2008 depended heavily on how well household consumption held up. Later on Thursday, US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson will testify before the US Senate Banking Committee. That comes on the heels of emergency interest rates cuts by the Fed in recent weeks and the approval of a $168 billion rescue package which President George W. Bush hopes will avert disaster, of which $152 billion in tax breaks will be applied this year, starting in May. The world's seven most industrialised economies said last weekend in Tokyo the outlook has deteriorated but that the U.S. economy should still grow in 2008, and that emerging market economies would continue to compensate for such weakness. By contrast with the long-industrialised economies, growth in Chinese GDP was official reported at 11.2 percent in the last quarter of 2007 and 11.4 percent for the year as a who
