<TITLE> Over 100 Bulgarian ministers were communist agents </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Sofia, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Over 100 Bulgarian ministers, who came to power since the fall of communism, had served as agents of the former secret police, a historical commission said on Wednesday. Bulgaria, a European Union newcomer, has been among the last former Soviet bloc countries to deal with its painful communist past and in late 2006 approved a law to unmask members of its Cold War spy agency, Darzhavna Sigurnost. Former agents will not have to quit their posts and will not be banned from running for political office. Last year the commission said President Georgi Parvanov and more than 100 deputies elected to Bulgaria's parliament since 1989 had also been agents. On Wednesday the commission published a list of 107 former agents. Some names, such as former prime minister Zhan Videnov, appear on both lists, since he was previously a deputy, before becoming a minister. Some 30 former ministers of the interior, foreign affairs, economy, defence, energy, agriculture and culture were among those cited in the latest list. A number of current deputy ministers in the ruling Socialist-led coalition government were also on the list. Bulgaria, once Moscow's most loyal Soviet satellite, had one of the most notorious spy networks, implicated in plots ranging from the failed assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II to the poison umbrella killing of an exiled dissident in London. "We see a tendency with every new government of decreasing numbers of ministers and deputy ministers who had been agents," said the commission's head Evtim Kostadinov. Some commentators and the country's spy chief have argued that naming KGB-trained agents would be a "lethal step" against the intelligence network because many of them are still active.
