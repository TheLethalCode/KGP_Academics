 Washington, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice admitted on Wednesday errors in the initial US approaches to rebuilding Iraq and Afghanistan, where she said international efforts were incoherent at first. At a congressional hearing where she was bluntly criticized by some Democratic senators over the US-led invasion of Iraq, Rice said the Pentagon did not have the capacity to conduct the reconstruction needed after the March 2003 U.S.-led invasion. She also said that in Afghanistan, where US-backed forces toppled the Taliban regime shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks, the international community had initially taken an "adopt a ministry" approach that did not serve the country well. "I was really quite unhappy that when it came to staffing major civilian reconstruction that we had not developed in the United States of America civilian institutions to do that," Rice told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. "The way we did it in Afghanistan ... I will label 'adopt a ministry' -- so one country took this ministry and another country took that ministry and, frankly, we are still paying for the incoherence of that effort," she said. "Then we got to Iraq, and it was given to the Defense Department but they would be the first to say that they weren't capable of mobilizing the full range of civilian capability for reconstruction," she added. Rice, who was national security adviser when U.S. President George W. Bush invaded Iraq and made the Pentagon responsible for its reconstruction and post-conflict governance, said it was only when civilian-military "provincial reconstruction teams" began operating "that we were able to do more." Rice testified to defend Bush's budget, which calls for hiring more than 1,000 new US diplomats and for creating a "civilian response corps" of people with expertise on such things as justice, health and education to support US reconstruction efforts abroad. SHARP CRITICISM Rice faced tough questions, chiefly from Democrats, about the course of the war in Iraq, where the United States has 158,000 troops nearly five years after it toppled former dictator Saddam Hussein. "We just can't keep this many troops in Iraq for a whole lot longer," said Sen. Joe Biden, the Delaware Democrat who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, saying he saw no US strategy for achieving political reconciliation in Iraq. "We are treading water. That's better than drowning, but we can't keep doing it," he added. "This (was) a disaster ... It is time to bring this war to a close." Sen. Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat who is one of Rice's sharpest critics on Capitol Hill, said during an exchange in which the two repeatedly interrupted each other. Rice and Boxer also tangled over Boxer's reference to the United States as an occupying force in Iraq. "I would never call them occupiers," declared Rice. Boxer said that to suggest that anyone in the room did not love and respect U.S. soldiers was "a low blow." Members of the Code Pink anti-war group attended the hearing, holding up signs with slogans like "Leave Iraq," "There is NO military solution" and "Security Thru Peace." As Rice left the hearing room, Code Pink protester Liz Hourican, 40, of Phoenix, Arizona, called Rice a "war criminal" and shouted "You should resign and take Bush with you."
