 Dhaka, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com) Police Wednesday arrested former prime minister Khaleda Zia's adviser ASM Hannan Shah at his Mohakhali DOHS home, hours after he was freed on bail. Tejgaon police arrested him shortly before 9.00pm and he was taken to Gazipur in connection with a case, Babul Ahmed, assistant to the BNP leader, told bdnews24.com by phone. Hannan Shah, who had earlier been detained under emergency powers rules, was freed Tuesday night from Narayanganj jail on the High Court's three-month bail. The bench of justices Khademul Islam Chowdhury and Md Abdul Hye issued the bail order after Hannan Shah appealed for cancellation of a general diary. Fatullah police arrested Hannan Shah on Feb 7 at the gate of Narayanganj jail shortly after he was released in connection with a separate case. A police sub-inspector filed the general diary against him with Fatullah Police Station on allegations that Hannan Shah had led a rally of about 200 party workers in the port city. Hannan Shah was earlier arrested on Nov 7 over an incident of violence near the late president Ziaur Rahman's grave at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar as BNP leaders marked National Revolution and Solidarity Day. bdnew
