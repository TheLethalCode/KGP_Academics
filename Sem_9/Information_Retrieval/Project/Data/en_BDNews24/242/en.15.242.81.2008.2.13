 FRANKFURT, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US stock index futures edged up before the start of Wall Street trading on Wednesday with all eyes on retail sales data for clues about the health of the US economy and the Federal Reserve's next monetary policy move. At 1020 GMT, Dow Jones futures were up 0.1 percent, S&P 500 futures rose 0.2 percent and Nasdaq futures traded 0.3 percent higher. The indicative Dow Jones index, which tracks how the Dow Jones stocks are traded in Frankfurt, was 0.04 percent higher. S&P 500 firms scheduled to report quarterly earnings include soft drinks group Coca Cola, agricultural machinery maker Deere & Co, Genzyme, which makes drugs to treat rare genetic illnesses, and data storage equipment maker Network Appliance.

In addition to the companies reporting results, the focus could also be on Applied Materials, whose shares rose 3.8 percent after the close on Tuesday after the chip-making equipment producer reported earnings that beat the consensus. Also after the bell, Genentech rose 3.7 percent after it reported that results of a second phase III trial supported the potential of Avastin in breast cancer patients. Cephalon rose 4.7 percent after the biotechnology company's quarterly earnings beat Wall Street estimates while Blue Nile fell after the online diamond jewellery retailer reported quarterly earnings and gave an outlook that was below Wall Street estimates. Overall on Tuesday, the Dow Jones rose 1.1 percent, the S&P 500 gained 0.7 percent and the Nasdaq closed fl
