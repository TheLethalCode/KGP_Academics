 Dhaka, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com) Students of Jagannath University continued their demonstration for the second day Wednesday to press a 10-point charter of demands. They besieged the VC's office, leaving the vice chancellor, proctor, treasurer and teachers stranded in the room. According to a protest programme announced the previous day, students boycotted classes and began demonstrations at 10.00 am, while a number of departments held examinations amid tight police security. Vice chancellor Dr SI Khan sat in a meeting with the protesters at 12:30 pm. The protesters announced Tuesday that they would boycott classes for two hours everyday. They also threatened to stay away from examinations until their demands are met. Students have been demanding improved facilities for one week, pressing a 10-point charter that included appointment of new teachers, better transportation facilities, freeing student dormitories from encroachers, and installing a medical centre and a gymnasium. They also said they needed a central library and a centre for teachers and students with a cafeteria. Political science student Imran Hossain, leader of the protesters said that they would withdraw their programmes following a successful discussion. bdnews24.c
