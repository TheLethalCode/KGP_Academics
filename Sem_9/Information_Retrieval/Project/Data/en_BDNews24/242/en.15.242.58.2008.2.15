 BRUSSELS, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union expects to reach agreement this weekend to take a key supervisory role in Kosovo even though half a dozen member states will not initially recognise the breakaway Serbian province's independence. "It is already more or less clear. The European Union will send a mission to Kosovo to replace the United Nations stabilisation one," Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel, whose country holds the EU presidency, told a Polish newspaper. "Kosovo has been under U.N. administration for 10 years. In practice, it's a kind of EU protectorate," he told the daily Dziennik in an interview published on Friday. The decision to launch the 2,000-strong police and justice mission with an EU civil administrator was to be approved at midnight on Saturday (2300 GMT on Friday) unless any of the 27 EU countries raised a last-minute objection, diplomats said. Kosovo's leaders are expected to declare independence on Sunday despite opposition from Serbia and Russia. EU foreign ministers will discuss their response on Monday. Diplomats said up to 20 EU countries including the major powers were likely to recognise the new state rapidly, but at least six -- Cyprus, Greece, Slovakia, Spain, Bulgaria and Romania -- have indicated they will not do so immediately. Cypriot Foreign Minister Erato Kozakou Marcoullis told Reuters: "Our position remains the same: we will not recognise a unilateral declaration of independence. Our position is based on principles of the U.N. charter, the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states and the role of the U.N. Security Council." ONE VOICE? Rupel sought to play down the differences over recognition, saying all member states agreed that the future of both Kosovo and Serbia lay in Europe -- code for eventual EU membership. "It is not the independence declaration that is most important," he said. "Of course, there have been doubts or negative feelings in some countries. But there are not that many after all. When the moment comes, I think the EU will speak with one voice." Diplomats said the EU ministers would discuss a declaration on Kosovo at their monthly meeting, while leaving recognition to individual member states. A presidency source said ministers would recall that EU leaders agreed with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in December that the status quo in Kosovo was unsustainable and stressed the need to move towards a settlement, essential for regional stability. They would call for a democratic multi-ethnic Kosovo committed to the rule of law and to the protection of minorities and of cultural and religious heritage. The declaration would underline the EU's readiness to play a leading role in strengthening stability in the region and in implementing a Kosovo settlement and pledge economic and political assistance "through a clear European perspective". A European Commission official said that U.N. Security Council resolution 1244, adopted in 1999 after NATO bombing drove Serb forces out of Kosovo, provided a legal basis for continuing EU aid after independence. Russia has argued that the EU would be in breach of that resolution if it sent a police mission to Kosovo or if its member states recognised the territory's independence without the Security Council's agreement. Rupel underlined that Kosovo faced huge economic and social challenges to build industry and overcome mass unemployment
