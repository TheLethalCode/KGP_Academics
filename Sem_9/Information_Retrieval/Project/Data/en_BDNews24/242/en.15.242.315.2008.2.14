But while the legal battle between Venezuela and Exxon Mobil escalates, analysts said the move to cut off oil shipments would have little impact on US supplies or the US energy giant. Major oil producers in the Middle East have assured the United States they could compensate for a supply disruption if Venezuela slows exports in its dispute with Exxon, a US official told Reuters on Wednesday.
