 Dhaka, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com) Jagannath University students halted their protest programme Wednesday after the vice chancellor confirmed that their demands would be met. Vice chancellor Dr SI Khan told reporters: "We agree with the demands of the students. We hope that we will be able to meet the demands in the next few months." After a midday meeting between the vice chancellor and students, protest leader Imran Hossain told reporters that they had halted their protest until March 31. Srabon Sarker, convener of the student protest committee, said the VC and the university treasurer had pledged that they would meet the demands by April. "If any demand remains unfulfilled we will re-launch rigorous protest programmes," he said. Students had earlier continued their demonstration for a second day Wednesday to press a 10-point charter of demands. They besieged the VC's office, leaving the vice chancellor, proctor, treasurer and teachers stranded in the room. According to a protest programme announced the previous day, students boycotted classes and began demonstrations at 10.00 am, while a number of departments held examinations amid tight police security. Students have been demanding improved facilities for one week, pressing a 10-point charter that included appointment of new teachers, better transportation facilities, freeing student dormitories from encroachers, and installing a medical centre, a central library, a cafeteria and a gymnasium. bdnews24.c
