 Dhaka, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com)  Arch-rivals Mohammedan Sporting Club and Abahani Limited were placed in Group A in the Twenty20 Premier Cricket League, beginning on February 14. Holders Mohammedan will take on the newcomer Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan in the inaugural match at Dhanmondi Cricket Stadium. Holders Mohammedan and runners-up Old DOHS were kept in two separate groups in the draw followed by last year's semifinalists Abahani and Victoria Sporting Club. Group A is considered a death group as title contenders Biman Bangladesh were also drawn in the same group along with Abahani and Mohammedan. The Cricket Committee of Dhaka Metropolis (CCDM) Monday completed the draw for the 12-team event, the curtain raiser for the upcoming Dhaka Premier Cricket League. Newcomers BKSP and Surjo Tarun were also drawn in the either side while the rest six teams were drawn in two groups through a lottery. The group phase and semifinals of the tournament will be completed on Feb 28, but the final and third-place decider are likely to be held on March 15 for international TV coverage. "The final and third-place decider will be telecast by Nimbus. So we have decided to wait for them until the end of the South Africa series," said MA Kabir, the acting member secretary of the CCDM.
