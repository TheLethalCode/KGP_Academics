 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com Telecoms Correspondent Dhaka, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com)The government is considering reducing BTTB call rates in the face of increasingly stiff competition from privately owned fixed-line telephone operators and falling clientele numbers. According to statistics from the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission, the number of customers signing up to privately owned fixed-line telephone operators almost doubled in 2007. By contrast, Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board lost approximately 5,000 of its customers in the same period. Post and telecommunication secretary Md Iqbal Mahmud told bdnews24.com Wednesday that the caretaker administration is considering a number of options to augment BTTB earnings, as well enhancing the quality of its services. In addition to cutting call rates, the BTTB is also planning to introduce attractive packages for rural customers, he said. On Nov 1 last year, the BTTB reduced its call rates to Tk 1.5 per unit for nation-wide-dialling, while local calls were fixed at Tk 1.5 per unit. For customers living in Dhaka or Chittagong, a peak-hour unit provides five minutes of talk time, while a unit lasts eight minutes in off-peak periods. A unit during peak-hours in the rest of the country is calculated at seven minutes of talk time, and during off-peak hours at 10 minutes a unit. BTRC said the total number of landline connections was 10.18 lakh in December 2006, which had risen to 11.87 lakh by December 2007. During the same period, BTTB customers fell from 8.77 lakh to 8.72 lakh. The number of clients the 12 privately owned fixed-line operators have dramatically climbed in the same period, from 1.41 lakh to 3.15 lakh, which represents an enormous 122 percent rise. Among the private companies, RanksTel, a public switched telephone network (PSTN) company, bagged the largest market share with the number of its clients increasing to 1.12 lakh from 0.45 lakh. Dhaka Phone followed with 0.24 lakh and Tele Barta managed 0.16 lakh. The government first issued zone-based business licences to private landline operators in 2004. In Sept 2007, five companies were permitted to market land phones in Dhaka. Mashroor Waiz, head of operations for RanksTel, told bdnews24.com that new customers were coming to the company in increasing numbers because of the higher quality of service. Former BTTB client Mizanur Rahman told bdnews24.com that customers with the government operator face countless problems in transferring connections and are often over-billed. bdnews24.
