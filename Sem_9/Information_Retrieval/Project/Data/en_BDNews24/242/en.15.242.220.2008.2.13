 Dinajpur, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com)A RAB member was released from the grab of suspected smugglers Wednesday, hours after he was "abducted" into the Indian territory, officials and witnesses said. Activities at the Hili Land Port came to a halt for an hour after the alleged smugglers dragged Havilder M Joynal Abedin into the other side of the border when he crossed the borderline unwittingly in a bid to chase the smugglers down. RAB DG Khandaker Hasan Mahmud told bdnews24.com: "An unsuspecting Joynal Abedin had crossed the borderline." The DG denied the news of "abduction". The RAB-5 Joypurhat outpost's commander, Major Shah Ali, said Joynal Abedin had been handed back to Bangladesh after talks between border guardsBDR and BSFof the two countries. Major Ali said Joynal was on duty at the Hili train station around 11.00am. Another RAB officer, asking not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue, said: "A gang of smugglers got down from a train coming from Parbatipur and Joynal and another on-duty officer tried to catch them." Locals said the smugglers had grabbed Joynal Abedin and took him into the Indian territory as the law-enforcers neared the border. Later, the smugglers turned Joynal in to BSF officers. The other RAB officer, a sub-inspector, managed to escape the abduction. bdnews2
