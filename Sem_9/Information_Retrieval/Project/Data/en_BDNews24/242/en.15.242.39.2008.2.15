 Dhaka, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com)  The chief adviser's special assistant, M Tamim, said Friday the coal policy would be finalised under the present government. Addressing the inaugural ceremony of a workshop of energy affairs reporters, Prof Tamim said that gas could be used for industrialisation if coal instead of gas were used to produce power. "It is not that we are running out of natural gas, but it is just that we have to extract coal in the interest of energy security," said Tamim, who oversees the Energy and Mineral Resources Division. Prof Tamim said that the coal policy would be finalised during the present government, and the method of extraction would be determined by experts taking into account social and economic issues. Production of power nowhere other than in Chittagong area was being disrupted due to the gas crisis. There was a daily deficit of 50 million cubic feet of gas against demand. It would take up to one year to resolve the problems, Tamim said. The CA's special assistant underlined the need for finding potential sources to ensure energy security. He said that no country, other than some in the Middle East had energy stocks for 50 years. "Local sources are not enough for us to ensure energy security, we have to sort out potential sources at the regional and global levels. We have to keep in mind that most expensive energy is no energy." Fifty-one reporters from eight upazilas in Dinajpur, Rangpur and Joypurhat attended the workshop, organised by Weekly Economic Times. bdnews
