 NAIROBI, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kofi Annan, the mediator trying to end Kenya's violent post-election crisis, prepared to reveal a deal on Friday struck between the feuding parties that looked set to shift the dispute towards a battle over the constitution. The Ghanaian mediator secreted the parties at a luxury lodge in southeast Kenya for three days in the hope of striking a deal to end the immediate political crisis by the week's end. But they flew back to the capital Nairobi on Thursday without agreeing on power-sharing, a sticking point seen by diplomats as essential to averting any more bloodshed. Opposition leader Raila Odinga accuses President Mwai Kibaki of stealing the Dec. 27 election, but the president says he won fairly and says the opposition has stoked violence instead of following Kenya's laws to challenge the result. Government officials said the four page agreement due to be revealed by Annan on Friday in Nairobi included a deal to rewrite the constitution within a year. The opposition wants to draft a new charter, share power in the government and hold a new election within two years. The government wants constitutional and electoral law changes, but only applicable to the next election, due in 2012. The only form of power-sharing being considered is giving opposition members ministries in Kibaki's half-filled cabinet, government officials have said. Annan is trying to bring an immediate end to a post-election crisis which plunged the east African nation into one of its darkest moments since 1963 independence, with at least 1,000 killed and 300,000 displaced in politically-tinged violence. The killings laid bare disputes over power, wealth and land that have festered in Kenya since the British colonial era, and have been manipulated by politicians ever since. Ethnic bloodshed, violent protests and images of forlorn refugees seen since the Dec. 27 poll have dented Kenya's reputation as one of the continent's most stable, prosperous democracies and hurt its booming economy. RICE TO WEIGH IN U.S. President George W. Bush, due to start a five-nation Africa tour on Saturday, has dispatched Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to throw her diplomatic weight behind the Annan initiative. Bush himself will not come to Kenya. Rice will underscore a U.S. commitment to help both sides agree "on a common way forward that will ... help the country regain its position as a democratic and economic leader in the region," the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi said in a statement. She was due to meet Kibaki, Annan, Odinga and others in Kenya on Monday, the embassy said. Odinga's Orange Democratic Movement said in a statement Rice's visit was "a sign of the growing U.S. and international awareness that this grave crisis is far from over and that international pressure is essential to ensure" Annan succeeds. With the talks' focus shifting to the constitution, an old, unresolved battle in Kenya is now back on the table. Calls for a new draft have existed since the early 1990s, to replace one dating back to just before independence. Critics say it fosters a winner-take-all system ripe for graft and tribal cronyism because of the president's immense powers of patronage and loopholes that let the executive trump the legislature and courts almost at will
