<TITLE> Danish newspapers republish Prophet cartoon </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Copenhagen, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Danish newspapers on Wednesday reprinted one of the 12 drawings of the Prophet Mohammad that caused global Muslim outrage two years ago, to protest against a plot to murder one of the cartoonists. The republication of the cartoon showing Mohammad holding a bomb drew criticism from Muslims, who said it would only stoke anger. A Danish citizen of Moroccan descent and two Tunisians were arrested on Tuesday for planning to murder 73-year-old Kurt Westergaard, a cartoonist at Jyllands-Posten, the Danish paper that originally published the drawings in September 2005. Five major daily newspapers, 10 smaller papers and a Swedish daily reprinted Westergaard's cartoon, the one that had caused the greatest controversy before. Most Muslims consider any depiction of the founder of Islam as offensive. "We believe this is very foolish and does not help building the bridges we need," said Imam Mostafa Chendid, a leading Danish Muslim cleric. Chendid, an imam at the Islamic Faith Community, a religious Muslim organisation at the centre of the first cartoon controversy, condemned all violence but said it would be difficult to absorb the anger young Danish Muslims might feel. "It will make our young people feel more isolated," he told Reuters. "The printing of the cartoon is an insult to our intellectual capacity. We are not against freedom of speech but we are opposed to continued discrimination of the Muslim minority in Denmark." Three Danish embassies were attacked and at least 50 people were killed in rioting in 2006 in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Several young Muslims have since been convicted in Denmark of planning bomb attacks, partly in protest at the cartoons. The Security and Intelligence Service said Tuesday's arrests near Aarhus in western Denmark were made after lengthy surveillance to prevent a murder that was in an early stage of planning. Danish media said the man of Moroccan descent had been released but faced preliminary charges while the two Tunisians would face deportation later this week. An editorial in left-leaning Politiken called the murder plot an attack on Denmark's democratic culture. "Regardless of whether Jyllands-Posten at the time used freedom of speech unwisely and with damaging consequences, the paper deserves unconditional solidarity when it is threatened with terror," it said.
