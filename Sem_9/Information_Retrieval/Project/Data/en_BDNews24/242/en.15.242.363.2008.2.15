 LONDON, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European equities fell by midday on Friday as the Federal Reserve's concerns about the U.S. economy and fears that banks faced further write-downs spooked investors. By 1200 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 was down 0.8 percent at 1,325.29 points. The index was on track to end the week with a gain of nearly 2 percent. UBS, hit by downbeat analyst notes a day after the bank unveiled new exposure to risky U.S. mortgages, leveraged finance and complex securities, slumped 5 percent. French investment bank Natixis tumbled 13.2 percent after it unveiled more than 1 billion euros ($1.5 billion) of write-downs linked to the credit crisis, making it the biggest loser on the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares. BNP Paribas was down 2.3 percent, Barclays lost 1 percent, and Credit Agricole shed 3.8 percent. Banks were the biggest weighted losers on the European benchmark. "We're worried about systemic risks, and mixed in with that we're worried about the fundamental deterioration of credit quality beyond subprime," said Bernard McAlinden, investment strategist at NCB Stockbrokers. "This feeds on itself in the form of a credit crunch and there's more weakness where there would not otherwise have been - that's what the markets are worried about and discounting at the moment," he said. Investors sought safety in defensive stocks, with drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline rising 1.5 percent after billionaire Warren Buffett's holding company Berkshire Hathaway picked up a small stake. Foods group Nestle and Danone also gained more than 1 percent. Elsewhere, German dialysis group Fresenius Medical Care gained 2.6 percent. French jet engine maker Safran jumped 4.6 percent to top percentage gainers in Europe and miner Vedanta gained 2.8 percent to top British gainers, both helped by brokerage upgrades. Around Europe, Germany's DAX index was down 0.5 percent, UK's FTSE 100 index down 0.4 percent and France's CAC 40 down 0.8 percent. OUTLOOK WORSENS, UBS SINKS In testimony before a congressional committee on Thursday, Bernanke acknowledged the outlook for the economy had worsened in recent months and said risks to growth had picked up, sending U.S. and Asian shares lower overnight. Investors were also fretting about more trouble in the credit market after Moody's Investors Service cut its rating on bond insurer FGIC Corp. The move could lead to even more write-downs at banks that own securities covered by the company. UBS fell sharply for the second day in a row, taking its losses for the week to more than 13 percent, and Citigroup said in a note that it expected more write-downs at the Swiss bank. "We estimate that the $80 billion remaining exposures could need 12-20 billion Swiss francs more markdowns in 2008," Citi said in a note, which was published on Thursday. "We continue to recommend an underweight stance on the European investment banks, with fears on revenue outlooks and balance sheet stretch as well as markdowns,"
