<TITLE> Algeria investors survive bombs, red tape </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Algiers, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Al Qaeda attacks in Algeria grab the headlines and the Soviet-style administration approves deals at a glacial pace, yet the north African nation remains a draw for investors lured by its multibillion dollar opportunities. That in itself is an achievement, given the enormous obstacles that businesses face. A big twin bombing in December, which killed 41 people at a court building and U.N. offices, dented investor confidence, prompted the departure of dozens of dependents of expatriate workers and probably led to delays in exploratory trips by foreign companies interested in investment possibilities. But in the two months since the blasts, Algeria has held a crowded pan-Arab business conference, launched an oil and gas licensing round, announced a $46 billion energy investment plan and seen its growing foreign exchange reserves top $110 billion. It also assumed the rotating presidency of OPEC, entered the final steps of negotiating a $20 billion deal with Dubai-based Emaar Properties and hosted economic visitors from near and far including New Zealand Trade Minister Phil Goff. "For us local investors, the bombings changed absolutely nothing," Abdelouahab Rahim, president of Algerian insurance, retailing and construction firm Arcofina, told Reuters. "We are positive in the long term. These temporary, irregular incidents won't brake investment in the country." AN INVESTMENT DRAW Speaking on the sidelines of a conference in Algiers packed with European and Arab tourism firms, he said Algeria's position would always make it an investment draw. "We're an hour's flight from Marseilles, an hour and something from Geneva." Brahim Bendjaber, President of the Algerian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, says extra hotel rooms had to be arranged at the last minute when it became clear that last month's Arab investment conference was oversubscribed. "Those people who visited Algiers had already seen the news (of the December bombs). But life goes on," said Bendjaber. Al Qaeda's North Africa wing said the Dec. 11 attacks, the second big bombing in a year in the capital, had targeted what it called "the slaves of America and France". The government quickly arrested or killed most of the group that planned the attack, but said it could not guarantee that other al Qaeda-aligned cells may not try a repeat performance. Foreigners agree. British ambassador Andrew Henderson told a conference in London last week that while he was upbeat about Algeria long-term, as far as attacks were concerned: "We have to face the prospect that there will be more to come." Trevor Witton, BP North Africa adviser, said Algeria had responded impressively to the attacks, but added: "Only time will tell whether this will fully restore investor confidence." High oil prices have helped Algeria, a developing north African country of 33 million, launch a $140 billion five-year development plan and repay a large part of its foreign debt. While no foreign firm has left since December, there may be some who have deferred investing, anxious that security costs may be too big a burden on top of the already onerous task of engaging with Algeria's complex and slow-moving administration. "Some investors considering coming to Algeria will have hesitated," said Wolfram Lacher of Control Risks consultancy. STATE SECRECY HARMFUL Oil and gas firms will always find a way of staying in a country with Africa's biggest gas reserves: They stayed put during a much worse period of political violence in the 1990s. But other firms able to provide the large numbers of service and industrial jobs needed by a population suffering deep levels of unemployment may have decided to wait and see. "I can't think of any firm that has written Algeria off," said Henry Wilkinson, an analyst at Janusian Security Risk Management. "But companies do wobble. There is a concern." The attacks have led to a tightening of security in Algiers. But protecting buildings inside the cramped capital is hard. The minimum 30-metre gap from curbside to wall sought by security consultants is rarely available in a city of winding narrow streets on a hillside overlooking the Mediterranean. Perhaps as potentially damaging to investment is Algeria's relative silence in the face of astute al Qaeda Web-based propaganda, consultants say. "Algeria news tends to be bombs. That's what people know, because they don't hear about anything else," said Wilkinson. With the notable exception of Energy and Mines Minister Chakib Khelil, Algerian officials can appear reluctant to pitch the case for trade and investment to the media and wider public. The habit stems from a long tradition of revolutionary secrecy dating back to the independence war against France. Even admirers of Algeria complain that leaves the field free for al Qaeda. Olga Maitland, President of the British Algerian Business Council, wants Algerian officials to speak up: "They have everything. The only thing is, no one knows about it."
