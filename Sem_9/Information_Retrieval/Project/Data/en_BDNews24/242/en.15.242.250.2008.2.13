 Islamabad, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A roadside bomb blast hit an election campaign convoy killing two people and wounding three on Wednesday in Pakistan's northwestern Swat valley, police said, as security fears deepen ahead of a Feb. 18 general election. Mufti Hussain Ahmed, an independent candidate contesting for a provincial assembly seat, was among the wounded in the blast in the restive valley where hundreds of pro-Taliban militants have been killed in clashes with troops in recent months. "Ahmed was going in a convoy of 8-10 vehicles on a campaign when the blast occurred, killing two people," said Swat's senior police official Waqif Khan. Violence has intensified in Pakistan in the run-up to an election that was due to be held on Jan. 8, but was delayed until Monday after the assassination of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto in a gun and bomb suicide attack on Dec. 27. Nine people, including four journalists, were wounded on Tuesday in southwestern Baluchistan in an explosion outside an election office of another independent candidate. Two suicide bomb attacks on election rallies in different parts of northwest Pakistan have killed at least 22 people and wounded more than 30 in the last week alone. The government has blamed Baitullah Mehsud, a Pakistani Taliban militant chief with al Qaeda links based on the Afghan border, for the attack on Bhutto and many others across the country. But Mehsud's spokesman, Maulvi Omar, told Reuters on Wednesday the Pakistani Taliban group have decided not to attack next week's general election and that their men would not be involved in any attack before or on election day.
