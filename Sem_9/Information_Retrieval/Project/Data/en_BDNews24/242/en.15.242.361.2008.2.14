 Dhaka, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has scheduled its second round of talks on electoral reforms with political parties beginning Feb 24, the chief election commissioner said Thursday. Speaking to the media in his office, CEC ATM Shamsul Huda said that the BNP would not be invited to the five-day talks. Discussions would be brief, and the EC's decision final, he said. Huda said: "We have recorded what political parties have said so far about electoral reforms. We assumed they were unanimous on issues regarding which they had no opinion. The laws will be finalised after discussing what can be accepted and what cannot from their opinions." The CEC also said that the commission had listened to the political parties, but that the EC would take the final decision. The issue of demarcating constituencies would not be mooted as only voters and representatives from concerned constituencies were entitled to give opinions on the issue, he added. On participation of the BNP, the CEC said: "We are ready. We will hold talks with the BNP as soon as the court gives a decision." Defending the EC's decision to invite the Saifur-led BNP faction, he said that he believed the EC would have had to face the same problems if the other faction had been invited. "The problems would be the same. It's the problem of split politics. If one faction is invited, the other faction accuses us of being partisan." The CEC said that they had asked both the BNP factions to settle their problems themselves. "You settle your contentions. Don't involve us in it. But they could not solve their problems. Four months have elapsed. We cannot wait for anybody. We have to go forward." Huda said that the political parties would be called to talks in reverse alphabetical order. According to the schedule, talks will be held with Bikalpadhara, LDP and Samyabadi Dal on Feb 24, Workers Party of Bangladesh, Communist Party of Bangladesh and Awami League on Feb 25, Jatiya Party, JSD (Inu) and NAP (Mozaffar) on Feb 26, Jamaat-e-Islami, JSD (Rab) and Jatiya Party (JP) on Feb 27 and Ganotantri Party, Krishak Janata League and Islami Oikya Jote on Feb 28. BNP could not take part in the first phase talks with the EC due to factional matters. According to the EC roadmap announced July 15 last year, the electoral laws are supposed to be finalised in March this year and talks ended by November. The EC ended talks with 15 political parties in the first phase. bdnew
