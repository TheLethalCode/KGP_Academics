The fertile Madhesh region is impoverished Nepal's food bowl where nearly half of its 26 million people live.

"Supply of essential goods has already gone down and the prices of commodities like potatoes and onions have shot up by more than 12 percent," Forum for Protection of the Consumer Rights official Jyoti Baniya said. Many Nepalis were furious. "What is the use of the government that cannot even give us oil," said Kumar Lama, a taxi driver who lined up outside a petrol station in the hill-ringed Kathmandu for more than eight hours and got ten litres of p
