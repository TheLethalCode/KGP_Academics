<TITLE> McCain winning Republican race slowly but surely </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Washington, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Slowly but surely US Republican presidential candidate John McCain is edging his way to his party's nomination, but upstart rival Mike Huckabee is making it as hard as possible. McCain easily won Maryland and Washington D.C. on Tuesday, and survived a strong challenge in Virginia from former Arkansas Gov. Huckabee, who drew valuable support from conservatives still uneasy about voting for McCain. The Arizona senator's narrow Virginia victory came at a time when he is considered the certain Republican nominee and should arguably have rolled to a big win in the state, where many elected Republicans had endorsed him. McCain, speaking to supporters gathered at a hotel in suburban Alexandria, Va., commended Huckabee for a spirited campaign. "He certainly keeps things interesting -- a little too interesting at times tonight, I must confess," McCain said. Huckabee's respectable showing in Virginia was proof that many conservatives -- distrustful of McCain's moderate positions on illegal immigration and original votes against tax cuts -- have turned to the ordained Baptist preacher as their candidate now that former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney is out of the race. "It's mainly a rebellion from the conservative base in the Republican Party," said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. Huckabee won a string of contests in southern states earlier this month, proving his strong appeal among social and religious conservatives. Sabato said McCain's unconvincing showing in Virginia signaled trouble for Republicans in their bid to hold on to control of the White House in the November election at a time when many Americans are weary of the Iraq war and worried about a possible recession. CLOSER TO NOMINATION Still, McCain emerged from the evening closer to clinching the Republican nomination and his aides believe that could happen on March 4, when Ohio, Rhode Island, Texas and Vermont hold their contests. Huckabee has not engaged in bitter attacks against McCain, leading some experts to believe he might want to be McCain's vice presidential nominee. But he did try to raise doubts about McCain at a breakfast meeting with reporters on Tuesday. "If (McCain) is the nominee, I think the party will eventually coalesce around him," Huckabee said, according to the Chicago Tribune. "I don't think he will be able to motivate" the base, "the footsoldiers." Republican strategist Scott Reed said Huckabee will eventually reach the end of his rope and give up. "I just think Republicans need to give Huckabee some space and let him recognize it's mathematically impossible for him to win the nomination. There aren't any miracles in national politics, and he'll come to his own conclusion," Reed said. With Democrats engaged in a closely fought battle between Illinois Sen. Barack Obama and New York Sen. Hillary Clinton, McCain is already turning his attention in part to a general election battle against either Democrat. In his speech, McCain drew some sharp differences with both of them, saying they would increase the size of the US government, raise taxes and weaken the war against Islamic extremism. He even questioned their campaign styles, compared to his own frequent encounters with reporters and town-hall meetings with voters. "They will promise to break with the failed politics of the past, but will campaign in ways that seek to minimize their exposure to questions from the press and challenges from voters who ask more from their candidates than an empty promise of 'trust me, I know better,'" McCain said
