 Washington, Feb 16 (bdnews24.comReuters) - US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will travel to Seoul for the inauguration of South Korean President-elect Lee Myung-bak on Feb. 25 and then on to China and Japan, the State Department said on Friday. Discussions in all three nations will cover the stalled effort to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons programs under a September 2005 agreement negotiated between the two Koreas, China, Japan, Russia and the United States. Rice's visit will be her first to the region since North Korea missed a Dec. 31 deadline to fully disclose its nuclear programs, which is regarded by other members of the six-party talks as a vital step toward ending its nuclear ambitions. She will not visit Pyongyang, said a senior US official who asked not to be named. North Korea, which conducted a nuclear test in October 2006, has taken some steps to meet its six-party agreement obligations, including proceeding with the disablement of its key nuclear facilities at Yongbyon. However, it is not clear whether Pyongyang is willing to fully carry out the agreement, which commits North Korea to "abandoning all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs." Under subsequent agreements, North Korea is slated to take steps including the dismantling of its nuclear facility at Yongbyon, in exchange for economic and diplomatic incentives from the United States and others. US officials have made clear they would drop North Korea from the US State Department's list of state sponsors of terrorism and end other sanctions once it has produced the nuclear declaration and completed disabling Yongbyon. Some analysts wonder if Pyongyang may have decided to slow down the six-party process and wait to resume negotiations with the next US president, who will take office in January 2009. Others question whether it has any real intention of giving up its nuclear programs. Assistant Secretary of State Chris Hill, the lead US negotiator with North Korea, will travel to China, South Korea and Japan ahead of Rice's trip, U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack told reporters. Hill will spend Monday and Tuesday in Beijing; Wednesday in Seoul and Thursday in Tokyo. A senior Us official ruled out the possibility of his traveling to Pyongyang on this trip. He then returns to the United States briefly before joining Rice in Seoul for the inauguration and accompanying her during her trip. After this, Hill travels on his own to Bangkok on Feb. 28-March 2; on Hanoi March 2-3, and Ho Chi Minh City March 3-4.
