<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com)Villagers in faraway areas will no longer have to travel long distances to receive the money sent by family members from abroad. The villagers will soon be able to draw money sent from abroad from the bank branch nearest their home. Private commercial National Credit and Commerce Bank and NGO Thengamara Mohila Sabuj Sangha are working jointly to introduce a foreign remittance project to provide the new services by April. Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed inaugurated the project at Dhaka Sheraton Hotel, saying the project would help cut the flow of inward remittances through illegal hundi . "The remittance sent by expatriates play a major role in the economy," the governor said, urging other banks to take similar schemes in conjunction with the NGO sector. NCC Bank's managing director Nurul Amin put the cost of the project at Tk 8 crore. The project is being part-financed through the Remittance and Payments Challenge Fund established by Bangladesh Bank with funding from DFID, with the aim of delivering remittance quickly and easily. Through the fund, the UK's Department for International Development will finance Tk 4 crore of the Foreign Remittance Projectwith the rest being provided by the NCC Bank. Under the new scheme, an electronic point of sale (POS) will be set up in all NCC branches and 250 branches of TMSS in remote areas, Nurul Amin said. Remittance recipients would be provided pre-paid cards free of cost to draw the money as required from the NCC Bank and TMSS branches or from designated automated teller machines (ATMs). The cards will make other services available through POS machines in designated shops. Nurul Amin told bdnews24.com the project work would be completed by March and recipients would be able to draw remittance money through the new system by April. DFID resident representative Chris Austin, NCC Bank chairman Tofazzal Hossain, TMSS director Fazlul Haque were among those present at the inauguration. bdnews2
