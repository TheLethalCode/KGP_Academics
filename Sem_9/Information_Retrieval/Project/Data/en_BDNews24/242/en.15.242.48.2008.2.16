<TITLE> As Berlin festival ends, US and UK films eye prize </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Berlin, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Berlin Film Festival ends on Saturday with a glitzy awards ceremony where a sweeping Hollywood epic and a low-budget British comedy are the critics' favourites for the main prize -- the coveted Golden Bear. With all 21 films in the main competition screened, and dozens more showcased in other sections of the annual celebration of cinema, "There Will Be Blood", which already has eight Oscar nominations, is the slight favourite. But the fact the film is already out in the United States and has won several top awards there may count against it in the eyes of the Berlin jury, which may favour Mike Leigh's "Happy-Go-Lucky", about an infectiously optimistic London teacher called Poppy. A win for Leigh would mean he completes the hat-trick of top prizes at the three big European cinema festivals, having won the Palme d'Or in Cannes and Golden Lion in Venice. Other popular entries included the emotionally-charged French film "I've Loved You So Long", starring Kristin Scott Thomas, Italy's "Quiet Chaos", about a grieving executive played by Nanni Moretti and Germany's "Cherry Blossoms - Hanami". Also in the running is "Lake Tahoe", a Mexican study of a teenager, "The Elite Squad", about corrupt policemen in Brazil fighting drug crime, and "Standard Operating Procedure", a US documentary about abuses at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. Rounding off the entries seen as possible winners are "In Love We Trust", in which a divorced couple in Beijing try to save their sick child, and "Elegy", starring Penelope Cruz and Ben Kingsley in a movie about ageing, insecurity and death. LIGHT RELIEF? It may be no coincidence that reviewers sitting through a typically dark selection of movies in Berlin -- the competition included films about death, prisoner abuse, war, massacre and corruption -- were taken with "Happy-Go-Lucky". "People are championing the film because it made us feel good, but is it prize-worthy?" asked Jay Weissberg, film critic for trade publication Variety. He, like many others, was disappointed by the general standard of the competition this year, although the Berlin festival's growing importance as a marketplace for buying and selling films keeps the big studios coming. Music was a major theme, with Martin Scorsese's "Shine a Light" getting its world premiere. The concert film of the Rolling Stones ensured the veteran British rockers and acclaimed US director were on the red carpet for a starry first night. Patti Smith was in town for a documentary about her life and Madonna presented her directorial debut "Filth & Wisdom", which several critics said was as poor as her worst performances in front of the camera.
