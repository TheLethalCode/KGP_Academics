<TEXT>
 Dar Es Salaam, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete on Tuesday named Mustafa Mkulo as finance minister in his new cabinet. The appointment, broadcast live on Tanzanian state radio, came after the previous cabinet was dissolved last Thursday following the resignation of Edward Lowassa. He quit as prime minister over a probe into a contract, and parliament endorsed his successor, Mizengo Pinda, on Friday. Until his appointment, Mkulo was a deputy minister in the finance ministry. He replaces Zakia Meghji, who lost his place in the cabinet. Bernard Membe has kept the foreign affairs and international cooperation portfolio.
