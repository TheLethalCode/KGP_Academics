 Dhaka, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com)A new deal signed between Bangladesh and Indian civil aviation authorities during a summit held in New Delhi on Feb 11-13 has cleared limits on the frequency of Bangladesh passenger flights to Indian destinations, an aviation official said Friday. The deal allows Bangladesh to increase the frequency of flights to Indian cities without exceeding the weekly ceiling of 61. "The Delhi memorandum of understanding removed the barriers to the frequency of Bangladesh flights to India," said Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh chairman Sakeb Iqbal Khan told bdnews24.com. Khan said Bangladesh Biman Airlines and GMG airlines are operating only 18 and 21 flights to Indian destinations. The reason is, both airlines run short of aircraft. On the other hand, Air India is operating six and Jet Airways 11 weekly flights to Bangladesh against the same flight ceiling of 61. Earlier on March 6, 2006, the Indian civil aviation authorities imposed an embargo saying that airlines from Bangladesh could operate a maximum of 26 flights to Kolkata and seven to New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Hyderabad each on weekly schedule. The Delhi summit was attended by civil aviation secretary Sheikh Altaf Ali, deputy secretary Abdul Hai and other top civil aviation officials. bdnew
