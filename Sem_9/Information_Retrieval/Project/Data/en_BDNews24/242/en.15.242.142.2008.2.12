 Washington,Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Below are some facts about Turkmenistan and its key natural gas projects. Central Asia's biggest exporter of natural gas, with production of 62.2 billion cubic metres in 2006, according to the latest BP Statistical Review of World Energy. Proven natural gas reserves total 2.86 trillion cubic metres, according to BP data, compared with top producer Russia with 47.65 trillion cubic metres and Iran with 28.13 trillion. Gas production rose 9 percent in 2007 and Ashgabat has pledged to triple output by 2030 to 250 billion cubic metres, Turkmenistan's Finance and Economy Ministry says. President Saparmurat Niyazov died in December 2006, and his successor, Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, has reassessed the country's international alliances. In November 2007 Turkmenistan hosted energy officials from the U.S. and EU and executives from BP, Chevron and Russian companies at a conference on the future of Turkmenistan's oil and gas export market. PIPELINE PROJECTS RUSSIA Dec. 20, 2007 Russia signed a deal with Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan to build a new pipeline allowing Moscow to keep Central Asian gas flows under its control. Analysts say the pipeline would have capacity of 10 to 20 billion cubic metres a year and rival an alternative route to Europe across the Caspian Sea which bypasses Russia. Most of Turkmenistan's gas is bought by Russian gas monopoly Gazprom , which agreed to raise the price it pays for Turkmen gas to $130 per 1,000 cubic metres from $100 in the first half of 2008. Berdymukhamedov also tentatively agreed to build a U.S.-backed trans-Caspian pipeline to ease Europe's dependence on Russian gas imports. CHINA In April 2006 Niyazov signed an agreement with Chinese President Hu Jintao who pledged to buy 30 billion cubic metres of gas a year from Turkmenistan through a new pipeline. The pipeline, in eastern Turkmenistan on the Amu Darya river, is expected to be on line by 2009. PetroChina gave the project a $2.2 billion injection in December 2007. In November 2007 Turkmen state media said China's Export-Import Bank pledged to lend Turkmenistan $300 million to develop its industrial base. EUROPEAN UNION The EU wants to persuade Turkmenistan to join the $7.4 billion Nabucco pipeline project, via Turkey and the Balkans to Austria, to help diversify gas supplies away from Russia. In November 2007 EU Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs met Berdymukhamedov to discuss formal energy accord that would reduce EU reliance on Russian exports. TURKEY Turkey relied on a gas pipeline from Turkmenistan via Iran until Iran's own supply was cut off, forcing Iran to halt exports to Turkey Jan. 7, forcing Turkey to halt supply to Greece. In December 2007 Turkey proposed building new gas pipeline from Turkmenistan via Iran with capacity of 16 billion cubic metres a year, after reaching agreement with Iran in July 2007.
