 Dhaka, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com)  Switzerland-based ICB Financial Group Holdings has clinched permission to buy troubled Oriental Bank, a central bank official said Thursday. In a letter, Bangladesh Bank gave the green light to ICB Financial Group, the highest bidder, to buy a 51.10 percent stake in Oriental. The central bank will sign a final agreement on Feb 28 with ICB, which will have to pay Tk 350.67 crore mentioned in the bid by the time, Bangladesh Bank deputy governor Murshid Kuli Khan told reporters. ICB, incorporated in Switzerland, is the holding company for several banks operating in Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia. The Group made its foray into Asia in 2003 by acquiring an indirect stake of 11.3 percent in Bank Internasional Indonesia, one of the largest banks in Indonesia, according to the company's website. ICB was listed on AIM (alternative investments market) of the London Stock Exchange in May 2007. "The tender (for Oriental) was opened on Feb 4. The deal will be signed on Feb 28," Murshid Kuli Khan said. On Sept 23, six companies had showed interest to buy the bank but only two of them took part in the bidding. Local market players BRAC Bank and Summit Industrial & Mercantile Corporation were among the four other candidates. The UK-based East Investment Private Equity and Sri Lanka's Hatton National Bank were the other contenders. On June 19 last year, the central bank took over Oriental Bank to protect depositors' interest in the wake of the bank's several financial irregularities and mismanagement. A central bank official was appointed as the bank's administrator to conduct emergency operations. The central bank removed Oriental's managing director and suspended the board of directors' activities on Aug 6, 2006. After intensive investigations, the bank's shares of its sponsors Obaidul Karim and Abul Khair Litu were confiscated as per the Banking Companies Act. They were found responsible for "pervasive irregularities". Later the central bank took a scheme to rebuild the bank, which increased its paid-up and approved capital. On Aug 2, 2007, the BB invited 'Expression of Interest' for Oriental's 50.1 percent stake with a minimum target price of Tk 350 crore. On Dec 12, 2007, the regulator floated tenders for a new management for Oriental, which was originally Al Baraka Bank when it started operations on May 20, 1987. In 2004, the individual ownerships of the ICB Banking Group were corporatised under the umbrella of ICB Financial Group Holdings AG, a Swiss based holding company. bdnews
