<TEXT>
 LAHORE, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan faces violence if political leaders fail to heed the people's demand for change, the widower of assassinated opposition leader Benazir Bhutto said on Tuesday. Asif Ali Zardari, who is leading Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party into a Feb. 18 general election, said the future of the people of Pakistan was at stake. The people were demanding genuine democracy and giving the establishment one last chance to deliver it, he said. "We are not listening to the people. We, all together, have to listen to the people and the people are looking for a change," Zardari told a news conference in Lahore. "The writing is on the wall. Either we stay together or the casualty rate is going to be exactly what it is, and has been, in other countries where great difficulties have come," he said. He did not name any specific countries, but in Kenya a disputed election in December unleashed a wave of violence in which more than 1,000 were killed. Zardari was on his first visit to the eastern city of Lahore since Bhutto was killed on Dec. 27. Riding a wave of sympathy, Bhutto's PPP could become the largest party in the National Assembly after the vote. The PPP's intentions will be key to U.S. ally President Pervez Musharraf's survival. While it is not a presidential election, a hostile parliament could seek to oust Musharraf. Lahore is Pakistan's political nerve centre and capital of Punjab, the country's biggest province which has about half of the seats in parliament. The PPP and the other main opposition party, led by former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, say Musharraf's allies are going all out to rig the election with government connivance. They say they will launch street protests if they are robbed of victory. Zardari said his party would go to "any extent" to protest a rigged result. He did not elaborate. Musharraf dismisses accusations of rigging, saying the electoral system has been refined to prevent cheating. "LAST CHANCE" Zardari said the establishment had to restore democracy to save the country. "I appeal to the establishment, this is the last chance Pakistanis are giving you," he said, referring to the military, which has ruled Pakistan for more than half its 61 years of history, and the civilian bureaucracy. The parliamentary elections are meant to complete a transition to civilian rule nine years after Musharraf overthrew Sharif in a coup. "It is my message that they must restore democracy if they want to save this country. They all have to go," he said. "Either they will stay, or Pakistan will survive," he said. Zardari later met Sharif and the two leaders told reporters they would fight together for democracy. They did not mention the possibility of forming a coalition after the election. Zardari also met Bushra Aitzaz, the wife of detained PPP lawyer Aitzaz Ahsan. Ahsan represented the country's chief justice, Iftikhar Chaudhry, after Musharraf tried to dismiss him in March. Ahsan was detained after Musharraf imposed emergency rule on Nov. 3 and dismissed Chaudhry and other judges seen as hostile to the president. Chaudhry, and several other judges, have also been under house arrest since Nov. 3 even though Musharraf lifted the emergency in mid-Decemb
