<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com)  Hundreds of trucks rumbled into Bangladesh Wednesday, carrying rice from across the border, after India eased restrictions on exports of non-basmati varieties. One condition remains: $500 in the minimum prices of a shipment per tonne. Some 300 tonnes of rice came through Hili border until 1:30pm, Kazi Mahmudul Hasan, assistant commissioner of Hili Customs Checkpoint, told bdnews24.com by phone. More trucks are awaiting customs clearance to enter Bangladesh, he said. The Indian authorities eased the ban on rice exports out of the country by approving only the $500 shipments against the L/Cs Bangladesh businessmen opened before Feb 7 when India imposed the export ban. Rice shipments also entered Bangladesh through Benapole land port, said Didarul Alam, superintendent of the cargo department at the port. On Feb 7, India imposed restrictions on the exports of rice through private channels. In another development, India agreed to export five lakh tonnes of rice to Bangladesh through the government channel. The prices of rice have been set at $399 per tonne on average. bdnews24.c
