 HARARE, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Anywhere else, news that inflation has topped 66,000 percent might have sparked street protests and sent nervous shudders through a government facing an election in just over a month. But Zimbabwe's economy has sunk so low for so long, that many appeared to have resigned themselves to their fate, largely shrugging off Thursday's announcement that year-on-year inflation had yet again shot to a record in December. Analysts say despite the decaying economy, President Robert Mugabe does not face much of a challenge to his 28-year rule during the March 29 election, given a deeply divided opposition and a political climate of fear. Zimbabwe's economy has been in recession for seven consecutive years, resulting in chronic shortages of food, fuel, water and electricity. Zimbabweans have long become used to finding their way around soaring prices, using barter to trade goods from magazines to cooking oil. "The reality is that we see the effects of high inflation each time we visit the supermarket, the (inflation) figure tells us what we know already," said Gabriel Makombe, a clerk at an insurance firm in central Harare. "The surprise, this time, is they actually released such a figure ahead of the elections," he added. The government statistics agency, often accused by analysts of understating price rises, said year-on-year inflation reached 66,212.3 percent from 26,470.8 percent in November. Zimbabwe has long had the world's highest inflation rate as it grapples with a recession blamed on Mugabe's policies, such as the seizure of white-owned farms to resettle landless blacks. The central bank was forced to issue high-value notes amid a bank note shortage between December and January. But the highest denomination 10 million Zimbabwe dollar bill -- worth $333 at the official exchange rate but only $1.25 on the black market -- will buy only two loaves of bread and is rapidly losing value. Apart from the chronic shortage of basics, frequent power cuts, broken sewers and bad roads mirror the economic decay in a country where only one in four adults is in formal employment. The government statistics agency has been increasingly reluctant to release the data, a tacit acknowledgement that authorities are losing the battle against inflation. The official inflation rate is nearly double that of the Weimar Republic in 1923. But it is still well below the worst modern-day hyperinflation, when inflation in Yugoslavia in 1994 peaked at 313 million percent. "REPRESSIVE ENVIRONMENT" Mugabe, 83 and in power since independence from Britain in 1980, is seeking re-election in the general election. He faces challenges from former ally Simba Makoni and old rival Morgan Tsvangirai of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change. While the rotting economy has piled pressure on Mugabe, political analysts say a divided opposition might be too weak to unseat him from power. "Despite glaring evidence of economic mismanagement, chances of Mugabe being voted out remain remote," political analyst Eldred Masunungure said. Mugabe denies ruining one of Africa's most promising economies and says it has been sabotaged by Western nations that have imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe as punishment for his land reforms. Last year Mugabe ordered a blanket price freeze in a desperate bid to stem inflation, but the move backfired as supermarket shelves were rapidly emptied of basic goods, worsening widespread shortages. Although the government has gradually relaxed price controls, many producers are yet to recover from the devastating price blitz and most shops are stocked with imported products that are beyond the reach of many. Supermarkets that were flooded by consumers at the height of the government crackdown on prices are now relatively well stocked but short of shoppers. "We simply cannot afford goods, like meat, a pint of milk and a loaf of bread, that we used to take for granted. Even the single meal most of us have grown used to is no longer guaranteed," said a government worker who declined to be named. Salaries for most government employees range from 200 million to 500 million Zimbabwe dollars and a union representing teachers making up the bulk of state workers is pushing for a wage hike to at least Z$1.7 billion to keep up with inflation. "My earnings are hardly enough for transport fares, let alone school fees and food," the government worker added
