<TITLE> Ghana growth to surpass 8 pct in 3 years:president </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ACCRA, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ghana's economy is growing at more than 6.5 percent and growth should exceed eight percent within three years as a major deepwater oil find comes on stream and yields revenue, President John Kufuor said on Thursday. "Ghana is now solvent and the economy is strong and resilient," Kufuor told parliament in his last state-of-the-nation speech before he steps down at the end of this year on completion of his second term in office. A 35 percent surge in gold exports and a successful $750 million debut international sovereign bond issue bolstered the economy of the West African state last year, helping to compensate for a slip in cocoa output and costly energy imports. The world's No. 2 cocoa producer was looking forward to receiving a major economic boost from oil finds last year in two deepwater offshore blocks, which Kufuor said held "commercial quantities estimated to be over 3 billion barrels so far". "Proceeds from the find will impact the economy within the next 2-3 years," said. "GDP (gross domestic product growth) has now moved beyond 6.5 percent and it is expected to pass 8 percent in the next three years," Kufuor said. He cited last year's debut bond issue, which he said was oversubscribed by $3 billion, as being a "litmus test" of the strength of the Ghanaian economy. Kufuor said he had set up a presidential committee to work on measures to ensure future oil income would be a "blessing", so Ghana could avoid the kinds of "curses" -- corruption, waste and conflict -- which bedevilled some African oil producers. "It is my belief that with proper management of revenue from this oil, Ghana's dependence on external donor support would be drastically reduced and the self confidence of our economy strengthened for the looming industrialisation," he added. Future industrialisation should include the development of an integrated aluminium industry, Kufuor said. MORE FROM COCOA Ghana's next development stage should also include the increased transformation of the country's raw materials to create more jobs, especially in the strategic cocoa sector. Kufuor reiterated the government's target to increase the annual cocoa harvest to one million tonnes by 2010 and said measures to achieve this were already bearing fruit. For example, the government was investing $100 million to tar roads leading to six major cocoa growing regions. Cocoa production for the 2007/2008 year is expected to be 650,000 tonnes. The crop reached a record 740,457 tonnes in 2005/2006 and was above 600,000 tonnes in 2006/2007. Kufuor said the government would vigorously pursue a target to increase the level of local processing of cocoa beans to 40 percent of the total harvest next year, up from the current level of 30 percent. While seeking more foreign investment in domestic cocoa processing, Kufuor said state cocoa industry regulator Cocobod was also negotiating with world agribusiness companies to process shea nuts, which like cocoa beans, can produce a butter used in the manufacture of chocolate, as well as cosmetics. Kufuor cited Archer Daniels Midland Co. as one of the companies that would be a partner for Ghana in shea nut harvesting and processi
