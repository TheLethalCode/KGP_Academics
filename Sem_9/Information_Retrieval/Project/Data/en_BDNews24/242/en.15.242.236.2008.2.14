<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com)  A Gazipur court has awarded bail to BNP leader ASM Hannan Shah Thursday, following his re-arrest the previous day. The hearing on the case filed against him began after he entered the courtroom of Gazipur additional chief judicial magistrate Md Saiful Islam at 12:30 pm. Police arrested Hannan Wednesday for a fourth time in less than nine months within 24 hours of his release from jail Tuesday. Tejgaon police arrested him at his Mohakhali DOHS home shortly before 9.00pm in connection with a case filed against him in Gazipur, Babul Ahmed, assistant to the BNP leader, told bdnews24.com. Hannan Shah, who is party chairperson Khaleda Zia's adviser, was freed Tuesday night from Narayanganj jail on three-months' interim bail. The High Court issued the bail order after Hannan Shah appealed for cancellation of a general diary filed against him with Fatullah Police Station. A police sub-inspector filed the general diary against him on allegations that Hannan Shah had led a rally of about 200 party workers in the port city. Fatullah police had arrested Hannan Shah on Feb 7 at the gate of Narayanganj jail shortly after he was released in connection with a separate case. Hannan Shah had earlier been arrested, on Nov 7, over an incident of violence near the late president Ziaur Rahman's grave at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar, as BNP leaders marked National Revolution and Solidarity Day. Hannan was first arrested on May 14, with his son Shah Rezaul Hannan, in a land grab case under the state of emergency. On the same day, a Gazipur court remanded the two for five days. They were freed on bail on July 22 from Kashimpur Jail in Gazipur after more than two months behind bars. On May 20, fisherman Haripada Barman filed a case with the same police station against the two for occupying a water body. bdnews24.com/c
