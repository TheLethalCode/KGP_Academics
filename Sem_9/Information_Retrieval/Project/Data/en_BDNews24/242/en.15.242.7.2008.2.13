 Tehran, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran blamed Israel on Wednesday for the killing of Hezbollah leader Imad Moughniyah in Damascus and condemned it as an act of "state terrorism", the official IRNA news agency said. "This measure is the result and another prominent example of organised state terrorism by the Zionist regime (Israel)," it quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini as saying. Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which does not recognise Israel.
