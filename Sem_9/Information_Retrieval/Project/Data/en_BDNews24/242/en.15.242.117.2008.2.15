 BRUSSELS, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union will push on Monday for the release of political prisoners in military-ruled Myanmar, saying sanctions could be toughened despite the generals' pledge to hold elections in 2010. At a regular meeting in Brussels, EU foreign ministers will warn of stepped up sanctions if human rights conditions do not improve, according to a draft statement seen by Reuters on Friday. The draft calls for the release of all political prisoners, including Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, and urges the junta to enter serious talks with political opponents.

The EU draft also calls on the generals to re-admit U.N. mediator Ibrahim Gambari and human rights expert Sergio Pinheiro.

"The EU stands ready to review, amend or reinforce the measures it has already agreed in the light of developments." The European Union tightened sanctions on Myanmar last year after the authorities staged a bloody crackdown in September on peaceful pro-democracy protests led by Buddhist monks. The measures targeted 1,207 firms and expanded visa bans and asset freezes on the country's military rulers. The junta made a surprise announcement last weekend of a referendum on a new, as yet unfinished, constitution in May to be a followed by a general election in 2010. Opposition figures and some Western countries have voiced scepticism that it will be willing to let the opposition compete in the vote or to relinquish power. On Wednesday, Gambari criticised Myanmar's extension of the house arrest of top Suu Kyi ally Tin Oo but said the generals might allow him to visit the country again sooner that a proposed mid-April date
