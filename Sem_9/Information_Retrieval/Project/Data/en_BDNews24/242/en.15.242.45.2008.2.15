 Dili, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia's Prime Minister Kevin Rudd made a lightning visit to East Timor's locked-down capital Dili on Friday in a show of strength after a double assassination attempt on the fledgling nation's leadership. With President Jose Ramos-Horta recovering from double gunshot wounds in an Australian hospital, Rudd shook hands with his East Timor counterpart Xanana Gusmao before meeting senior United Nations and Australian military officials. "An immediate response to Timor Leste (East Timor) during this time of insecurity is a sign that our neighbour has a great faith in democracy and that the protection of our democracy is central to establishing a climate of peace and security," Gusmao told a press conference after meeting with Rudd. "Our nation is a proud nation. We are ready to progress from volatility to stability, and from fear to confidence. Many people ask is this achievable in light of this week's events? Yes, it is achievable, because a bullet can wound a president but it never can penetrate the values of democracy," Gusmao added. Security was tight in Dili for Rudd's expected three-hour visit, with Canberra having sent more than 200 rapid-reaction troops and police to reinforce local and international security forces, including 800 Australian troops already on the ground. "The purpose of my visit today is to state in clear and loud terms that Australia will stand shoulder to shoulder into the future in the defence of East Timor's democratic system of government," Rudd said at the joint press conference. He said Australian troops would stay for as long as East Timor's government wanted them to be there. The two leaders also discussed further economic co-operation in areas such as infrastructure development, youth employment and rural development. STREETS CALM In Dili, the streets were calm and shops, offices and banks were open. Fears of violence in the wake of the double assassination attempt have so far proved unfounded. "I only hope there will be no more unrest and rebellion. Because of the rebellion, the government imposed the state of emergency and we can't do anything at night. We just stay at home. It is not good for us young people," said Adriano da Costa, a shopkeeper in central Dili. Ramos-Horta, 58, was shot at his home on Monday after rebel soldiers led by Alfredo Reinado launched a pre-dawn assault. Reinado was killed in the gunfight, while Gusmao escaped injury in a near-simultaneous attack on his motorcade. Rudd was expected to visit Ramos-Horta at Royal Darwin Hospital later on Friday ahead of another round of surgery for the Nobel Peace Prize winner. East Timor's parliament has imposed a state of emergency following the latest unrest in Asia's youngest nation. The country's prosecutor-general issued arrest warrants for 24 people suspected of involvement in the attacks. Rudd, a former diplomat, said he wanted to inspect security in East Timor for himself. "I am ... deeply concerned about the future security and stability of East Timor," Rudd said. "It's pretty murky to be honest. Another reason for going up is to see if I can have a clearer understanding of the facts ... because that shapes where it goes to from here," he said. Reinado was buried on Thursday as United Nations police kept close watch over supporters and mourners for signs of violence. Australian special forces soldiers are hunting rebel troops hiding in the hills outside Dili. Reinado led a revolt against the government and was charged with murder after factional violence in 2006. Later that year, he escaped jail with 50 other inmates, embarrassing security forces. East Timor gained full independence from Indonesia in 2002 after a U.N.-sponsored vote in 1999 that was marred by violence. Indonesian invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975. Many thousands of East Timorese died during the brutal occupation.
