 BOGOTA, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Colombian authorities on Thursday were investigating how a grenade, a handgun and thousands of dollars in cash were smuggled into a high-security prison holding demobilized paramilitary commanders. The militia bosses, who disarmed under a peace deal with President Alvaro Uribe in exchange for short jail terms, could lose benefits of the accord and face extradition to the United States if investigators link them to the arms stash. Itagui prison near Medellin holds some of the top paramilitary warlords accused of massacres and drug trafficking during their bloody war with Marxist guerrillas, who are still fighting in Latin America's oldest rebel insurgency. "We are waiting for results from the attorney general to find out who is involved in these illegal activities in the high-security prison," Deputy Justice Minister Guillermo Reyes told local radio.

Ex-paramiliary commander Carlos "Macaco" Jimenez in August was the first militia boss kicked out of the peace deal after authorities accused him of maintaining his criminal and drug trafficking activities from his prison cell. Begun in the 1980s by wealthy landowners to counter rebels, the paramilitaries soon controlled large swathes of land where state presence was weak. They carried out massacres and kidnappings sometimes in league with the armed forces. Under Uribe's government, more than 30,000 paramilitary fighters demobilized and the president credits the program in part for a drop in violence from the four-decade conflict. But rights groups say the government has been too lenient with the commanders, who they say have kept criminal gangs alive and failed to live up to the conditions of the peace deal to confess and compensate victims. Uribe, a key Washington ally, is also under pressure for a scandal linking some of his lawmaker allies to the paramilitary squads. Dozens of lawmakers and politicians are jailed and under investigation for ties to the militi
