 Dhaka, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com) - The government will sit with importers of edible oil every 15 days to review the market situation, commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said Wednesday. Zillur said the government would take measures so that no chaos could surface over the availability and the prices of edible oil. "All aspects including supply and demand will be reviewed fortnightly with importers," Zillur told bdnews24.com after a meeting on the matter at the ministry. "We need to see the interest of the businessmen along with need of consumers. The prices of oil are being determined in line with the global market," he said. "The government will look into the situation so that no chaos could brew in any part of the country." He said the stocks of edible oil were satisfactory. "There's nothing to worry about. We are doing everything possible to make sure supply is adequate. Anything can be solved through discussion," the adviser said. Business representative Abdur Rouf Chowdhury, who attended the meeting, told reporters: "It is difficult for us to control the retail prices of edible oil." He asked the consumers not to buy oil if there is no label of minimum retail price on the container. The commerce secretary, the director general of Bangladesh Rifles and NBR chairman also attended the meeting. bdnews24.c
