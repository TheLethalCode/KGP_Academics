<TITLE> Under-fire Greek PM says pension reform a must </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Athens, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Greece's prime minister on Friday brushed aside a wave of protests against his conservative government's pension reforms, saying an overhaul of the ailing system was imperative but he gave no concrete details. The government, re-elected in September, has pledged to fix the country's pension system which is expected to collapse within 15 years if nothing is done due to an ageing population, but it has run into stiff opposition and strikes. It is expected to submit its pension reform bill in the coming weeks. "The (pension system's) limits are being significantly stretched, we need to act immediately," Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis told parliament. "It won't be easy, but (reforms) are necessary." Protesters marched on parliament during the prime minister's speech, demanding that current benefits not be changed. More protests were planned for later in the day. The government has seen its popularity plummet in recent months to the lowest level since it came to power in 2004, largely as a result of a series of scandals and economic reforms. Greek private and public sector workers held a 24-hour strike earlier this week and have said they will call for further walk-outs if the government goes ahead with changes to the social security system. Experts say actuarial deficits for pension funds could balloon to 400 billion euros ($579.7 billion), almost twice the size of Greece's economy, without immediate changes. Unions argue that pension funds are victims of the state, which has dipped into their reserves for decades and refuses to pay its own contributions. Greece's economy minister has said about 1.5 billion euros owed to funds by the state will be paid this year. Details of the reform plan have yet to be presented by the government but Karamanlis gave a broad outline on Friday. Greece's fragmented social security system, which includes 155 main, auxiliary and health funds, will be the initial focus of the changes, Karamanlis said. "This (number of funds) constitutes a major problem. They are overly bureaucratic, a waste of resources and frustrate citizens with poor service," he said. Officials have said the government plans to merge the plethora of funds into about 4-6 main ones, raise the age limits in some job categories and provide incentives for workers to stay at work longer. Karamanlis has repeatedly promised not to raise the retirement age of 65 for men and 60 for women, but has said that hundreds of professions currently entitled to early retirement will have these privileges drastically cut. "Millions of citizens are demanding justice," Karamanlis said. "We can't sacrifice the good of the many for the benefit of the few."
