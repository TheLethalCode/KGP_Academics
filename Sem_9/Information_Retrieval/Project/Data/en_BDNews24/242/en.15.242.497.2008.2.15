 NICOSIA, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sunday's presidential election in Cyprus, which could revive peace talks and influence Turkey's EU accession hopes, looks set to go to a second round, with the three main candidates almost tied in polls as campaigning ends. Analysts say the vote is too close to call, with a runoff expected on Feb 24. Campaigning officially ends at midnight on Friday, with polls opening at 0500 GMT on Sunday. "Nothing is certain. It's a pollster's nightmare," said Pambos Papageorgiou at the European University in Nicosia. Incumbent Tassos Papadopoulos, Communist challenger Demetris Christofias and right-winger Ioannis Kassoulides are each seeking to win over half a million Greek Cypriot voters. Greek and Turkish Cypriots have lived for almost 35 years on opposing sides of a United Nations ceasefire line which splits the Mediterranean island. Stalled efforts to reconcile the two sides are hampering Turkey's chances of joining the European Union and the festering conflict has been a thorn in relations between NATO allies Greece and Turkey. Turkish Cypriots accepted a U.N. peace plan in 2004, but Greek Cypriot voters rejected the blueprint, urged on by current president Papadopoulos. He is battling for re-election against Kassoulides, a moderate who wants to build bridges with Europe, and Christofias, a nominal communist whose party has traditionally enjoyed close ties with Turkish Cypriots. International efforts to mend fences between the communities are expected to be revived by 2009, when Brussels is due to review Turkey's compliance with conditions laid down for its membership bid. Entry talks with Ankara have already been partly frozen over its refusal to open Turkish ports and airports to Greek Cypriot traffic. The island is represented in the EU by its internationally recognised Greek Cypriot government. Northern Cyprus is a breakaway Turkish Cypriot state recognised only by Ankara. "The effort we are making now is to encourage the U.N. to come here and take the pulse," a western diplomat said. "They are waiting for the results of the elections. They could be a lot more reticent in the event of a Papadopoulos victory." Papadopoulos, who rejects claims he is a hardliner, says efforts to break the deadlock will begin again after the election, but that any solution not taking Greek Cypriot demands into account will be resisted. RENEWED VIGOUR "With renewed vigour, and immediately after the elections, we will try to expedite movement on the Cyprus issue," he said. Papadopoulos says any settlement must be based on a United Nations framework advocating an incremental approach. The framework has been in place since 2006, but talks are stalled. Rivals Kassoulides and Christofias both say Papadopoulos is a poor negotiator whose tough stance has burned bridges with the international community, and warn the stalemate could lead to the island's partition. Greek and Turkish Cypriots have lived separately since a Turkish invasion in 1974 that was triggered by a brief Greek-inspired coup. "We have lost most of our friends and allies in the European Union ... There is a lack of movement, lack of contacts, and an inward-looking foreign policy," Kassoulides told Reuters. The party backing him for president supported the U.N. plan in 2004, but says it accepts the plan's rejection in a referendum by 76 percent of Greek Cypriots. "What exists now is a total rejection of the (U.N.) plan. Our responsibility now is to work together, to try get a better settlement acceptable to the people," Kassoulides said. The three candidates all support the Cypriot government's refusal to recognise a unilateral declaration of independence by Kosovo. The province's Albanian majority is expected to declare independence from Serbia on Sunday
