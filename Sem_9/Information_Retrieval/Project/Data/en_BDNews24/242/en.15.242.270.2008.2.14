 Dhaka, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com) - Both defending champions Mohammedan and runners-up Old DOHS, Thursday started their Premier Division Twenty20 Cricket League openers on the wrong foot suffering defeats to newcomers at Dhanmondi Cricket Stadium. Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan (BKSP) handed a 15-run defeat to Mohammedan while Surjo Torun inflicted a 34-run defeat on DOHS at the same venue. However, title contenders Abahani Limited, Biman Bangladesh and Victoria Sporting Club got off to fine starts thrashing their respective opponents at the BKSP ground. Abahani defeated Kalabagan KC by 6 wickets, Biman defeated City Club by two wickets and Victoria thumped Sonargaon Cricketers by six wickets. At Dhamondi, Raihan Anas struck unbeaten 53 off 42 balls and Saimon Ahmed made a 43-ball 41 as BKSP managed 141 for four in 20 overs despite a precarious 20 for three in 4.4 overs. Mohammedan, in reply, fell in trouble to lose four top batsmen for 58 before the fifth-wicket stand of Faisal Hossain and Anwar Hossain raised hope of seeing the target. Faisal (26) returned to the dressing room giving a catch behind the wickets with the team needing another 47 runs in 30 balls with five wickets intact. However, it was left arm spinner Tapash Ghosh, who dismissed four batsmen quickly to stop Mohammedan at 126 all out with four balls to spare. Old DOHS were bundled out for 101 in 19.5 overs in face of some tight bowling from Surjo Torun, who set DOHS to chase 136 to win the match. DOHS never recovered their damage after being reduced to 24 four as pacers Mohammad Sharif (3/5) and Monirul Islam (3/20) shared six wickets while Delwar Hossain, Monwar Hossain, Nayeem Islam and Nazmul Hossain took one wicket apiece. Anisur Rahman Sanchoy raised some hope of a stroke-filed 36 that studded three fours and two sixes before being caught by Shamsur off Monwar while Monir Hossain (11 not out), Maruf Reza (10), Rashedur Rahman (10) were other batsmen to cross the double digit. An all-round performance from Rajaul Karim helped Abahani reach 115 for four in 17.5 overs in reply to Kalabagan's paltry total of 114 for nine in 20 overs. Rajaul remained unbeaten on 27 off 22 balls after taking three wickets for 16. Victoria reached the target of 112 in 18 overs losing four wickets after restricting Sonargaon Cricketers to 111 for seven in 20 overs. Farhad Hossain (24), Nasiruddin Faruque (23), Dhiman Gosh (21 not out) and Gazi Salahuddin (14) were notable scorers for Victoria. Biman Bangladesh made 125 for eight in 19.4 overs after bowling City Club out for 124 in 19.4 overs. Two fine knocks from M Selim (43) and Monirul Haq (36) powered Partex SC to a two- wicket win over Young Pegasus, who set Partex to chase 116 to win.
