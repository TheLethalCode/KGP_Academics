<TEXT>
 Beijing, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - North Korea appears committed to going forward with an initial nuclear disarmament agreement, but big hurdles remain over energy aid and other concessions, US experts just returned from North Korea said on Saturday. Siegfried Hecker, a senior U.S. nuclear scientist, told reporters in Beijing that North Korea was moving ahead with disabling its key Yongbyon nuclear facility as part of a disarmament agreement reached at six-party talks. But Hecker said that North Korea officials had told him they had slowed down the disablement work and would not provide a full declaration of its nuclear programme until other countries in the agreement provided heavy fuel oil and other aid as agreed last year. "They are not prepared to give a full declaration until these issues are resolved," he said, after making a private visit to the North.
