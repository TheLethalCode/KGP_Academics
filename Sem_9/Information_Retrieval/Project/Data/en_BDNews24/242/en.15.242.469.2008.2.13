 Dhaka, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com) The Securities and Exchange Commission has made it mandatory for companies with Tk 50 core or more in paid-up capital to go public, in an effort to increase share supply to the capital market. SEC executive director Farhad Ahmed told reporters Tuesday that private limited companies who want to raise their paid-up capital to Tk 40 crore or more have to convert to public limited companies within six months of the publication of the amended securities rules. "Those who already have paid-up capital of more than Tk 40 crore will have 12 months to go public after the gazette notification of this decision by us," he added. In case of public limited companies, those who have a paid-up capital of at least Tk 50 core have to issue an IPO within 12 months after their operation, Farhad said. "However, public limited companies having no commercial operations at present will get three years' time to come up with an IPO after starting their operations," he added. The SEC director said that non-compliance with these regulations would result in financial penalties "up to any amount". Farhad told reporters that the regulatory body has approved Delta BRAC Finance's proposal to float zero-coupon bonds worth Tk 150 crore. A zero-coupon bond is a discount bond bought at a price lower than its face value, with the face value repaid at maturity. "The three-year bonds will be issued to banks and financial institutions which would not be listed on the public market," he added. The executive director also informed reporters of the regulators decision to stop investors opening beneficiary owner's accounts upon allotted primary shares. "We have seen that a certain number of BO accounts are found closed after the shares have been allotted and this is increasing at an alarming rate. There are 275 cases in Islami Bank alone," Farhad said. bdnews2
