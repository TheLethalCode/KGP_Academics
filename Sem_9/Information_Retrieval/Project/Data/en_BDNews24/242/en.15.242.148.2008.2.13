 Dhaka, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com)Raw jute should be officially declared an agricultural product as Bangladesh exports about Tk 300 crore worth of raw jute a year to Pakistan alone, industry experts said Wednesday. The demand came from a press conference co-organised by Bangladesh Jute Association (BJA) and Pakistan Jute Mills Association (PJMA). A six-member delegation of the PJMA is in Dhaka to accelerate jute import for Pakistan. PJMA chairman Abdul Khaliq in his maiden speech said that the quality of jute produced in Bangladesh was one of the best in the world. "With that in view, we and our Bangladeshi counterparts for the first time jointly presented the hindrances to the raw jute trade, to the Bangladesh government," he said. Khaliq, who has been associated with the industry for more than 50 years, said the two trade bodies discussed ways to improve trade between the countries as well as sat with government agencies on the industry's problems. He stressed the use of electronic equipment in measuring and maintaining the standards of raw jute, as practiced nowadays in the international arena. "We met the chief of the Bangladesh Jute Research Institute and requested him to do so and cooperate with the PJMA in skills development to produce diversified jute products," said Khaliq. "The bottleneck in the industry is shipping; only 3 vessels from Bangladesh have anchored at the Karachi port in the last 3 months," he added. Reazul Karim, chairman of BJA echoed him and added that for this reason about 30,000 tonnes of raw jute was trapped with Bangladeshi exporters. "At least one break-bulk vessel of the Bangladesh Shipping Corporation (BSC) should be used every month to regularise the exports out of Mongla port. Otherwise, both the countries would suffer a great loss," the BJA chairman said. He further said that the two trade bodies had met the BSC managing director and asked him to resolve the problems and that the BJA also demanded withdrawal of 'flag protection' clause. Karim pointed out that the government did not identify raw jute as an agricultural product. So, the industry was being deprived of the subsidies and facilities. Jute goods were, however, identified as agricultural products, he said. Karim urged the government to include raw jute under the category that would lead to increased export earnings from the sector. The delegation also met commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman and jute adviser Anwarul Iqbal to highlight the shipping problem and other trading complications, he added. Bangladesh is the lone supplier of raw jute to Pakistan. About seven lakh bales of raw jute worth Tk 300 core are exported every year accounting for a third of the total raw jute exports. The visiting PJMA delegates also had meetings with the secretary general of International Jute Study Group, Bangladesh Jute Mills Association and Export Promotion Bureau to exchange views and sought their cooperation for jute exports from Bangladesh. bdn
