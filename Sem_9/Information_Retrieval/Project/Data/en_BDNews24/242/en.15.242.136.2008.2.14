 LONDON, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Equity markets rose and riskier currency bets came back onto the table on Thursday as investors were cheered by an improvement in Japan's economic outlook and signs that the US slowdown might not be as severe as feared. Wall Street looked set for a positive start after three consecutive gains on the S&P 500's this year. European shares gained three-quarters of a percent while Japan's Nikkei average closed up 4.3 percent, its biggest one-day gain in six years. The catalysts for the rallies were Wednesday's US retail sales data, which were better than expected and eased fears of a consumer spending collapse, and much stronger-than-forecast fourth-quarter Japanese growth, reported earlier on Thursday. Japan's economy expanded by 0.9 percent in the fourth quarter, more than double forecasts. "We had come into the week after a series of disappointing data (and with) recession fears," said Audrey Childe-Freeman, senior European economist at CIBC World Markets. "The better economic information we have had in the past two days is producing come some welcome relief to equity markets." News was also relatively bullish on the corporate earnings front. French automaker Renault, for example, beat its 2007 profit margin target and said it expected to sell over 10 percent more vehicles in 2008 compared with 2007. The pan-European FTSEurofirst was up 0.7 percent. MSCI's main world stock index was up 1.1 percent. Emerging market equities, as measured by MSCI gained 2.5 percent. Euro zone economic prospects were something of a dampener, however, with fourth-quarter GDP growth being reported at half that of the third quarter, 0.4 percent versus 0.8 percent. But the data slightly beat expectations. U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, meanwhile, were due to testify on the state of the U.S. economy and financial markets before the Senate Banking Committee later in the day. Paulson was expected to tell Congress that the United States is experiencing a "significant" housing market downturn but the economy is fundamentally sound and should avoid recession. CURRENCY RISK The euro rose to a one-week high against the dollar while Japan's yen was generally weaker as risk appetite improved. "Currency markets generally will take their lead from the general risk appetite tone," said Paul Robson, currency strategist at RBS Global Banking. The euro was up 0.3 percent against the dollar at $1.4615 -- highs seen a week ago. The dollar was down 0.1 percent versus the Japanese currency at 108.18 yen, just off a one-month peak near 108.37 yen set a day earlier. The euro was 0.2 percent higher at 158.13 yen. The Japanese currency usually benefits from a risk averse mood as currency investors tend to exit risky carry trade bets funded by cheap borrowing in the yen, but falls when risk appetite improves. Euro zone government bond prices were generally lower, depressed by the better global economic prospects and the equity market gains. "We're at levels now where we need continuing bad news, and plenty of it, to rally further," said RBS rate strategist Andy Chaytor. Two-year euro zone government bond yields were at 3.17 percent, up 2 basis points, while 10-year yields were flat at 3.98 percent, having touched a high of 4.009 perce
