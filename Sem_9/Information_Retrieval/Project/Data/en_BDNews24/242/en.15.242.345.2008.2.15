 DEKALB, Ill., Feb 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A man who killed six students and then himself during a shooting spree at an Illinois college was an expert on prisons whose work had drawn notice in academic circles, one report said on Friday. The unidentified 27-year-old man grew up in the Chicago suburbs and was enrolled as a graduate student at another state school far removed from the site of Thursday's bloodbath at Northern Illinois University, the Chicago Tribune reported. Officials at Northern, a 25,000-student school 65 miles (104 km) west of Chicago, had confirmed earlier that the man who suddenly appeared at the front of a lecture hall and turned it into a shooting gallery had attended that school in 2007 as a graduate student in sociology. The newspaper said the man had helped write papers on self-injury in prison and on the role of religion in early U.S. prisons, work that earned him a dean's award. The Tribune said he had since enrolled in graduate studies at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the central part of the state. The shooter "by all accounts that we can tell right now was a very good student that the professors thoughts well of," school president John Peters said on Friday in an interview on ABC's "Good Morning America." "There is nothing in our system that he has had any counseling," he added. "Motive is the one thing that we're trying to pin down at this point. I really at this point have no sense of that. There is no note or threat that I know of." The DeKalb County coroner's office which confirmed six deaths in addition to the shooter said the students who died ranged in age from 19 to 32, though only four of their names had been released. In all 21 people were either killed or wounded by the shooter. Terrified and bleeding, students fled the hall before the gunman shot himself on the stage in the latest in a series of shootings at U.S. colleges and high schools. Virginia Tech, a university in Blacksburg, Virginia, became the site of the deadliest shooting rampage in modern U.S. history in April when a gunman killed 32 people and himself. Peters in a separate interview on CNN on Friday said the university had reviewed and improved its emergency response plans after the Virginia Tech shooting. While universities traditionally have been "some of the most open institutions," he said, "events like this and Virginia Tech and others are forcing us to reconsider how we do things. I think that is unfortunate but necessary." President George W Bush said he had spoken to Peters and told him "that a lot of folks today will be praying for the families of the victims and for the Northern Illinois University community. Obviously a tragic situation on that campus and I ask our citizens to offer their blessings, blessings of comfort and blessing of strength.
