<TEXT>
 Paris, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks pared losses and turned positive after data showing better-than-expected US monthly retail sales eased worries over the outlook for consumer spending in the world's biggest economy. According to a U.S. Commerce Department report, sales at U.S. retailers rose 0.3 percent in January, which was an unexpected pickup that partly reflected stronger sales of new cars and gasoline. January's sales increase followed a 0.4 percent decline in December and was contrary to Wall Street analysts' forecasts for a 0.2 percent decline. At 1340 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.1 percent at 1,335.40 points. The index has lost 11.5 percent so far in 2008, hit by fears of a U.S. economic downturn.
