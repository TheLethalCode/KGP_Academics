 GAZA, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hamas said on Friday it has told Egyptian officials it would consider a ceasfire with Israel if it lifted its blockade of the Gaza Strip and ceased military operations in all Palestinian territories. Hamas also discussed with Egyptian officials this week the possibility of a prisoner deal that could lead to the release of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, seized by Hamas in a 2006 raid, in exchange for Israel freeing several hundreds of Palestinians from its jails, Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said.

Hamas seized control of the Gaza Strip in June after routing the forces of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's secular Fatah forces. Israel, which is pursuing peace talks with Abbas, has since tightened sanctions on Gaza. Palestinian militants blasted open the Rafah border wall with Egypt last month allowing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to pour into Egyptian north Sinai to stock up on goods in short supply due to the Israeli-led blockade. The holes were closed several days later following Hamas-Egypt talks.

Abbas has won some international support for a proposal to handle security at the crossing, but he wields little control in Gaza and Hamas has demanded a key role
