<TITLE> Iftekhar spells out concern over 'illegal activities' of migrant workers </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com) Foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury said Wednesday the majority of Bangladeshi workers employed overseas could suffer because of a handful of colleagues involved with criminal activities. He said the matter was important since the labour importing countries were worried about the increasing illegal immigration as well as criminal offences. "Bangladeshis have a reputation as a disciplined and hard-working people abroad. But we have reports that a few Bangladeshis have become involved in illegal activities," Iftekhar told reporters in the ministry. The issue came to forefront amid media reports that some Bangladeshi workers got involved in illegal activities in Saudi Arabia, prompting stern action by police. The Saudi envoy to Dhaka last week had talks with the foreign adviser and discussed the matter. To avoid any tension, the adviser said he would visit the kingdom although it was not clear exactly when. Saudi Arabia is the largest market with employing some 17. 5 lakh Bangladeshi workers. The adviser said Wednesday it would be painful if the majority of works suffered because of a few, especially when a boom in manpower export is looming large. Iftekhar, who also oversees the Ministry of Expatriates Welfare and Overseas Employment, said Bangladesh had recently opened up a new horizon of overseas employment to many countries including some European ones. Romania is one of them where more than 100 workers have got job recently, he said, adding that more countries will join the list of lucrative destinations. But the effort could be hurt if a bad name haunts Bangladesh in this sensitive sector, he said. Exporting workers is vital for Bangladesh since a significant amount of remittance comes from the workers employed abroad. Some five million Bangladeshis currently work in 100 countries across the world, according to the official figure. Last year, they channeled some US $6.56 billion as remittances. The adviser said a record of 92,000 workers got clearance to go abroad in January alone. bdn
