 LONDON, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil jumped above $96 a barrel on Friday, surging to a one-month high as investors fixated on the possibility -- however slim -- of OPEC member Venezuela halting supplies to top consumer the United States. The South American country, one of the largest crude exporters to the United States, cut shipments to Exxon Mobil earlier this week after the U.S. oil major won court orders to freeze over $12 billion of Venezuela's assets. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, a critic of U.S. President George W. Bush, imposed the embargo on Exxon after threatening to cut off all shipments to the United States in the row over nationalisation of Exxon assets in Venezuela. U.S. crude was up $1.15 at $96.61 by 1418 GMT, while London Brent crude rose 54 cents to $95.68. "I can't believe the Venezuelans will actually go ahead and do that, but as long as there is this uncertainty it's going to continue to have a bullish impact," said Tony Machacek at Bache Commodities. U.S. Energy Secretary Sam Bodman said on Thursday he did not expect Exxon to have trouble replacing oil supplies from Venezuela, but said the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve would be available if needed. Major oil producers in the Middle East have already assured the United States they could compensate for a supply disruption if Venezuela slows exports. Separately, OPEC said its current oil output of some 32 million barrels per day should be enough to meet growing demand and boost global stocks, a possible sign that it may decide to keep supplies steady at its March 5 meeting. "If that is the way they see (the market), then it seems unlikely they will increase or decrease production. Steady is the most likely outcome," said Kevin Norrish, energy analyst at Barclays Capital. OPEC projected world demand would increase by 1.23 million bpd, down 70,000 bpd from its January forecast
