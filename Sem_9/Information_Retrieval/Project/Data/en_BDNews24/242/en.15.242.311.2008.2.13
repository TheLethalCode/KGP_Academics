<TITLE> Outcome of gas talks victory for Ukraine: Tymoshenko </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Kiev, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko on Wednesday described as a "great victory" a deal with Russia on gas supplies which avoided a threatened cut in shipments and eliminated intermediaries in trade. Tymoshenko, returned to office in December at the head of a team linked to the 2004 "Orange Revolution", said the agreement amounted to the beginning of the end of lonstanding murky dealings in gas that hurt Ukraine and its economy. "The gas talks were a great victory for the democratic team," Tymoshenko told a cabinet meeting after the agreement was clinched in Moscow on Tuesday, minutes before a Moscow-imposed deadline on Ukraine to pay arrears or face supply cuts. "This is another step towards establishing order in the gas market, another step towards eliminating corruption and shadow schemes in the energy sector." The deal was reached during talks between Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko and Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin. Tymoshenko, who remained in Kiev, has long denounced as unnecessary and costly the use of intermediaries, particularly RosUkrEnergo, the Swiss company which oversees gas shipments to Ukraine. She had called for a scheme to enable national energy company Naftogaz to become profitable. The row between the two ex-Soviet states had caused concern among European customers fearing a repeat of a 2006 pricing conflict, when shipments by Russian gas giant Gazprom were briefly halted and supplies to EU countries disrupted. TENSIONS EASE Alexander Burgansky, an analyst from Renaissance Capital in Moscow, welcomed the deal for easing tensions, though details were still to be clarified. "Interruptions of gas supply have been avoided, suggesting that the relationship has moved to a more civilised level with both parties acknowledging the importance of reliable gas supplies and the role both countries play within the broader European energy markets," he said. Tymoshenko had been charged by the president with finding solutions to the arrears problem in the run-up to the deal. Fired by Yushchenko in 2005 during her first term as premier, she reconciled with him last year, but new differences have emerged in recent weeks, especially over the gas industry. Yushchenko has been far less insistent in wanting to abandon the use of intermediaries in the gas trade. "We are ready to begin making payments for gas once we get the agreements and standard contracts and if no one manipulates the price," the prime minister told her cabinet. RosUkrEnergo will continue to supply gas to the Ukrainian border until the end of the year and a second intermediary Ukrgazenergo, will still distribute it to Ukrainian customers. The deal calls for the creation of two new intermediaries, set up in equal parts by Gazprom and Naftogaz to oversee shipments to Ukraine and distribution inside the country. Details on how they will function or when they will be established have yet to be made public. One prominent Ukrainian politician, Anatoly Hrytsenko, chairman of parliament's security and defence committee, was sceptical of the deal, saying the proposed new organisations changed little in terms of energy supply schemes. "This is the same thing, only seen from a different angle," Hrytsenko, a former defence minister and key figure from the "Orange Revolution", said in a statement. "But now Gazprom will become an even more powerful player with the chance to have even greater influence on our internal market and boost its capitalisation. This is clearly not in Ukraine's interest."
