<TITLE> EU says latest WTO negotiating texts lack balance </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Brussels, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New negotiating texts aiming to push forward global trade talks lack balance and could have offered more negotiating progress in services, an official at the European Union's executive branch said on Friday. Earlier this month, World Trade Organisation (WTO) mediators sought to advance long-running trade talks by issuing revised drafts for agriculture, industry and services. "The EU believes that the necessary balance between the NAMA (non-agricultural market access) and the Agri (farm) texts has not been found," a European Commission official said. "The Agri text reflects the work done by negotiators and defines a credible landing ground. The NAMA text, however, does not reflect much of the work done in Geneva and can only slow progress towards modalities," he said.
