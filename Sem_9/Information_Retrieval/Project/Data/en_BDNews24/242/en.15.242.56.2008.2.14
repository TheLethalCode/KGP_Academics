 KHARTOUM, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sudan has raised objections to the appointment of a British army officer as chief-of-staff to the joint UN/African Union peacekeeping force in Darfur, a UN official said on Thursday. The officer had been made military chief of staff to the force commander of the U.N./AU mission in Darfur (UNAMID) Martin Luther Agwai, who is Nigerian, a spokesman for the peacekeepers said. "At the moment we are aware that concerns have been raised by the government," he added, declining to go into the nature of the objections. "We are working to resolve these." The British officer has not been named but is understood to be a well-respected senior officer with experience of operating in Africa. Any rejection by Sudan would be seen as a major snub to the UK, a major donor of humanitarian aid to Africa's biggest country. Arabic language newspapers on Thursday quoted a senior Sudanese army officer saying Khartoum had already rejected the appointment of the British officer. The British officer would have provided an unwelcome "link" between UNAMID and European peacekeepers that are due to start work in neighbouring Chad, Major General Majdhub Rahama told a conference on Wednesday, according to Sudanese daily Al-Sahafah. Another reason for rejecting the British officer was the fact that the UK had no peacekeepers on the ground in Darfur, reported London-based newspaper Al-Hayat. But the UNAMID spokesman told Reuters that officials were still hoping to resolve the matter. Another diplomatic source said that Sudan had still not officially rejected the appointment. No one was immediately available for comment from the Sudanese armed forces. The spokesman for Sudan's foreign ministry Ali al-Sadig said he had not been briefed on the matter. Khartoum has been increasing sensitive about the involvement of non-African troops in the 26,000-strong peacekeeping force. In November, Sudan's president Omar Hassan al-Bashir said he would only accept Chinese and Pakistani technical units already committed and specifically rejected an offer of 400 army engineers from Sweden and Norway. Many analysts have accused Khartoum of using the nationality of incoming UNAMID peacekeepers as an excuse to stall on the full implementation of the force. So far, only 9,000 peacekeepers have been deployed. Khartoum has strongly denied the accusation and pointed to the delay caused by the failure of other countries to supply UNAMID with helicopters and other vital equipment. The force is supposed to bring peace to the western region, in which international experts estimate some 200,000 have died and 2.5 million been driven from their homes in fighting since early 2003, when mostly non-Arab rebels took up arms, accusing the government of neglect.
