<TEXT>
 Cotonou, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President George W. Bush arrived in Benin on Saturday to start a five-nation tour of Africa aimed at highlighting US support for health, education and democracy in the world's poorest continent. Air Force One, carrying Bush and his wife Laura, touched down at Benin's Cadjehoun international airport where the US leader was due to meet President Thomas Boni Yayi in a brief stopover before flying on to Tanzania. Bush is also due to visit Rwanda, Ghana and Liberia during his six-day trip to Africa, his second to the continent. Bush's African tour in the final year of his presidency takes him to five countries carefully chosen to try to show a different face from the poverty-plagued and conflict-stricken continent normally portrayed by the world's media. Benin, Tanzania, Rwanda, Ghana and Liberia are now relatively stable states whose presidents are viewed by Washington as a new generation of leaders, with democratic credentials, who can show the positive potential of Africa. They are also showcases for US aid projects backing hospitals, schools and anti-AIDs and anti-malaria initiatives considered a success in a Bush foreign policy scarred by controversy over his handling of Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan. NEW PARTNERSHIP Bush's visit also aims to stress Washington's desire to establish a new partnership based on trade and investment and not purely on aid handouts that have dominated the West's past relationship with post-colonial Africa. "The period of aid and paternalism has passed. A joint venture with Africa, that's what the future is all about," Bush said before he left for his Africa tour. Although his visit avoids African countries in crisis or turmoil, the conflicts in Kenya and Sudan's Darfur will loom large over his trip. Bush has announced he plans to send Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to Kenya to support efforts by former United Nations chief Kofi Annan to end a post-election conflict that has killed 1,000 people. He is also expected to forcefully reiterate US backing for more international peacekeepers to deploy in war-torn Darfur to try to end the killing of civilians in the Western Sudanese region which has been called "genocide" by Washington. Bush's visit follows the creation late last year of a US military command for Africa, Africom, aimed at increasing the US presence on the African continent, which provides a significant portion of America's oil needs. While it has ruled out the creation of any new military bases in Africa -- one exists in Djibouti -- Africom is looking for a site on the continent to locate its headquarters. The reaction from most African states has been mostly cool or hostile, with the exception of Liberia, Africa's first republic founded by freed American slaves in 1847, which has offered to host the Africom HQ. Bush said before leaving on his trip he would seriously consider Liberia's offer.
