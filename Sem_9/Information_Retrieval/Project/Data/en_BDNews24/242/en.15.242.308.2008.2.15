<TITLE> British unmanned Moon probe wins UK-NASA backing </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A plan for the first British-led mission to the Moon won the backing of an Anglo-American space committee on Friday. The Joint Working Group on lunar exploration named the proposed unmanned MoonLITE launch as its primary mission for collaboration. The 100 million pound launch would fire three or four darts carrying measuring instruments into the surface of the moon from an orbiting satellite. Scientific data recorded by the darts would be transmitted up to the satellite and relayed back to Earth. The working group brings together experts from America's NASA and Britain's space authority, the British National Space Centre (BNSC). The recommendation was contained in the group's first report since it its creation at a meeting in Washington last April. The group aims to foster collaboration in space exploration between Britain and the United States. "This joint report represents a milestone in our co-operation with NASA," said Professor Keith Mason, the chairman of the UK Space Board, the BNSC's governing body. "The proposed missions provide an opportunity to harness the UK's world-class expertise in small satellite, communication and robotic technologies focused on exploration of the Moon." MoonLITE, proposed for launch by 2012, would be largely built by British firms, with NASA assisting and providing navigation equipment. The mission has been devised by a British team including Surrey Satellite Technology (SSTL), an offshoot of the University of Surrey which has already sent 27 satellites into space. MoonLITE would be able to reach areas of the moon not accessed by the Apollo launches of the 1960s and 1970s, said SSTL System Engineer Andy Phipps, a member of the working group. "The Apollo landers all landed in equatorial regions on the near side, for safety. With this kind of mission you can attempt more scientifically interesting missions," he said. Potential targets for the MoonLITE probes include the Moon's permanently dark far side and its two shadowed polar regions. A peer review of the scientific research proposed by the mission will now be conducted, along with a technical study to examine the costs and infrastructure required for the launch
