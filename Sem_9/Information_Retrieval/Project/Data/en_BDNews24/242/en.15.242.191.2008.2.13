<TITLE> Buffett lifts stock market mood; worries linger </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Hong Kong, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Equity markets rose on Wednesday after billionaire investor Warren Buffett made an offer to take on $800 billion of US municipal bond risk, but worries about the health of the US economy continued to gnaw away. Buffett's plan eased fears for the health of the insurance sector and lifted US stocks on Tuesday, inspiring Asian investors in turn. "The news of Buffett and the perception that markets are hovering at a bottom are shoring up stocks," said Won Jong-hyuk, an analyst at SK Securities in Seoul. "While there's a consensus that the crisis is far from over, investors nevertheless seem to think at the current price levels stocks are worth buying." Global investors are focused on one big question: the chance of a US recession, which could infect the global economy and slow growth worldwide. For Asian companies, the risk counts double, as a weaker dollar also spells a tougher export market. Since the start of the year, Asian stocks have fared worse than US shares, with MSCI's index of Asian stocks outside Japan down about 13 percent against a fall of about 7 percent in the Dow Jones industrial average. The pan-Asian index was up 0.5 percent by 0244 GMT as modest gains across the region outweighed a 2 percent fall in Shanghai, which was catching up with global declines after the week-long Lunar New Year holiday. Japan's Nikkei average was up 1.4 percent. RECESSION RISK Buffett's offer eased fear of credit downgrades at US bond insurers forcing the sale of billions of dollars of municipal debt and curbed the risk aversion bid that has stoked a US government bond market rally for much of the past seven months. Japanese government bonds edged lower while insurers such as Japan's Millea Holdings Inc rose. The yen steadied after weakening to almost 107.5 to the dollar, helping blue-chip exporters such as Canon Inc "Basically, the market's worries have been just temporarily lifted," said Takashi Ushio, head of the investment strategy division at Marusan Securities in Tokyo. "This doesn't address the root cause of the crisis. The only thing that will really solve the situation is measures like a fund injection." GOLD TARNISHED Buffet's move also sapped enthusiasm for safe-haven assets such as gold which slipped back towards $900 an ounce. The metal was also tarnished by a top industry official in India saying high prices were killing off demand. However, returning Chinese traders powered Shanghai copper futures to the daily 4 percent limit at the market open as the metal raced to match gains in the London price Asian tech investors saw the brighter side of the US picture, despite a glum Nasdaq, which was dragged to a flat close by Apple Inc and Research In Motion But Asian stocks' gains were limited by uncertainty ahead of key Japanese and US economic indicators including Japan's gross domestic product data due on Thursday. Thursday's centrepiece will be US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's testimony to Congress about the state of the US economy, following a quarterly survey from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve on Tuesday, which said the economy would struggle to grow in the first quarter of this year
