 TOKYO, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japanese Defence Ministry officials may be assigned to chaperone U.S. troops on nights out during a drill on the northern island of Hokkaido this month after the arrest of a U.S. marine for the rape of a 14-year-old girl, Kyodo news agency said on Friday. The incident on Okinawa revived memories of the 1995 rape of a 12-year-old girl on the island in 1995, which sparked angry demonstrations. Politicians have called for effective measures to prevent such incidents. A small group of U.S. troops is set to take part in a four-day drill in Chitose on Hokkaido in late February. "We're considering regular patrols of the area when U.S. soldiers go out and in certain circumstances having bureau employees accompany them," Kyodo quoted Tomohiko Futamata of the Hokkaido Defence Bureau as saying. "We take seriously the unforgivable incident in Okinawa and will strongly request that U.S. soldiers maintain strict discipline," the report quoted Futamata as adding. On Monday Japanese police arrested 38-year-old Tyrone Hadnott on suspicion of raping a 14-year-old Japanese girl. Hadnott has denied raping the girl but acknowledged forcing her to kiss him, local police have said
