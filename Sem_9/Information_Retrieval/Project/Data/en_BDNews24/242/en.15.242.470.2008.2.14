 Dhaka, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com)  Thousands of young couples celebrate Valentine's Day Thursday with hearts, flowers and messages to their loved ones. The history of Valentine's Day is unclear but the most common tale is that the name Valentine originated from the 3rd century Catholic priest Valentine. During the period, Valentine defied the Roman emperor Claudius II, who had imposed a ban on marriage, and arranged nuptials for young lovers in secret. When his actions were discovered the emperor ordered that Valentine be put to death. It is said by some that Valentine fell in love with the jailer's daughter in confinement. Before his death the last words of a letter to his beloved were: "From your Valentine". Whether the latter be true or not, the sacrifice and devotion of the Roman priest has become the symbol of human love across the world today. Valentine's Day celebrations are relatively new in Bangladesh but media and commercial culture have made it a hugely popular one. For young lovers, particularly in the cities, the day is special for exchanging gifts, Valentine cards and flowers. Concerts have also become a favourite Valentine's Day event for young couples and bands performed in different venues of the capital. Shops were found to be offering an increasing variety of Valentine-themed sales on the day. Different cultural, social and business organisations hosted diverse events, with TV channels also broadcasting special Valentine programming.
