 NEW YORK , Feb 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters/Billboard) - Don't hold your breath waiting for the next Spice Girls reunion. Geri Halliwell, a.k.a. Ginger Spice, said a second outing "probably won't happen ever again." The quintet's Return of the Spice Girls World Tour wraps February 26 in Toronto. "This is the last time you will ever get to see this Girl Power, the five Spices on the stage as one," said Halliwell, who left the group in May 1998 but was a chief proponent of the current reunion. That said, Halliwell told Billboard.com that she would not entirely shut the door on a bit more Spice if fans really, really want it. "What this reunion taught me is you can never say never," she said. "If you had asked me 10 years ago whether there'd ever be a Spice Girls reunion concert, I'd have gone, 'No f---ing way!'" Halliwell said the reunion was "an experience of a lifetime," and denied reports that it was coming to a premature end because of infighting among the five Spices. "Actually it's gone on longer than planned," Halliwell said, "because we thought we were only going to go to the end of January. After February everybody had commitments -- kids had to go back to school and that. So we had to leave places out that we would have loved to have gone to." Halliwell has her own post-Spice plan in place. In May she'll roll out the first in a new children's book series featuring a character named Ugenia Lavender, whom she cryptically described as "a rebirth of girl power."
