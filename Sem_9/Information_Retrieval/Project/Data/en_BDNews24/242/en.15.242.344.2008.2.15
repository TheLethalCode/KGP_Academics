<TITLE> About 20,000 rally in Georgia against president </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TBILISI, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Around 20,000 people protested in central Tbilisi on Friday against Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili, the largest demonstration against the revolutionary leader since he was sworn in for a second term last month. Protesters wore their trademark white neck-scarves at the rally outside parliament where in November police fired teargas and rubber bullets to break up an anti-government demonstration. "Long live Georgia! Misha go!" they shouted, a reference to a widely used nickname for Saakashvili, who swept to power in a peaceful 2003 revolution. Georgia's main opposition parties have staged a series of demonstrations since a Jan. 5 presidential election which they say Saakashvili rigged. Western monitors said the vote was flawed but still reflected the will of the electorate. Alongside the usual banners and slogans were portraits of Georgian billionaire and opposition financier Badri Patarkatsishvili who died at his mansion in southern England on Tuesday. "Badri Patarkatsishvili's death in suspicious circumstances has given rise to suspicion that he has been killed," Koba Davitashvili, one of the opposition leaders, told the crowd. Former Soviet Georgia is at the heart of the volatile Caucasus region which hosts a major pipeline pumping oil from the Caspian Sea to Europe. British police have said that the 52-year-old Patarkatsishvili, who chain-smoked cigarettes, died of a heart attack, but that hasn't stopped the gossips on the streets of Georgia linking Saakashvili to the death of one of his most powerful enemies -- even indirectly. "I think that even if Badri died of a heart attack, it happened because of the accusations against him," Guram Kacharava, one of the demonstrators, told Reuters. Saakashvili accused Patarkatashvili, known simply as Badri, of plotting a coup and ordered his arrest. Patarkatsishvili made his fortune in Russia during the chaotic post-Soviet 1990s and was regarded with suspicion in his native Georgia. He campaigned for the Jan. 5 election without setting foot in his native Georgia and won around 7 percent of the vote by pledging to lavish millions of dollars on the poor. This compared to 53 percent for Saakashvili and 27 percent for the main opposition candidate Levan Gachechiladze. The opposition have threatened to set up a tent city outside parliament to protest against the election
