 LONDON, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Use of the drug Crystal meth is growing fast in Britain and could become as widespread as crack cocaine in just four years, according to leaks of report written by the country's police chiefs. Experts say that even occasional recreational use of the drug -- a form of amphetamine which is crystallised in order for it be smoked -- is dangerous. The internal report by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) found that despite its low use, current growth levels in Britain match those already experienced in Australia and the U.S., the BBC reported. An ACPO spokeswoman confirmed the report's existence but declined to elaborate, saying it was for internal use only. Later, in a statement, the chairman of the ACPO Drugs Committee, Humberside's Chief Constable Tim Hollis, said: "We are in no way complacent but we are very alert to the dangers and closely monitoring the problem within the UK. "Our prime concern is to protect the public and police staff who deal with those making and supplying drugs. Naturally, we are seeking to work closely with all other agencies to reduce the risk of the drug (becoming) more common here." Crystal meth, a stimulant sometimes used by clubbers and also known as ice, Nazi crank and yabba, was reclassified as a Class A drug last year, joining heroin on the list of the most dangerous illegal substances. The drug can quickly become addictive, leading to depression, paranoia, violence, kidney failure and internal bleeding. Last year, government medical advisors announced the sale of some cold remedies would be restricted to one small pack per customer in Britain to prevent gangs making the drug. Large packs of decongestants containing the chemicals ephedrine and pseudoephedrine would be withdrawn from sale and replaced with smaller packets. The move followed police concerns that criminals were using the ingredients to manufacture methylamphetamine -- crystal meth -- in illegal laboratories
