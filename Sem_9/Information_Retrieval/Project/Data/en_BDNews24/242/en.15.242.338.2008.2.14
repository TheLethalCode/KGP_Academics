 MOSCOW, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday he intended to become a powerful and long-serving prime minister after leaving the Kremlin but rejected suggestions he would dictate orders to his likely successor. Putin, giving his last annual news conference before his second term ends in May, said he fully trusted the Kremlin's candidate for president, First Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, and would have no problems working with him. Medvedev enjoys blanket coverage on state-controlled media and is widely expected to win a big poll victory next month. "Dmitry Anatolyevich (Medvedev) and I have worked together for 15 years and I would never have deigned to support a candidate for president if he needed coddling and advice on how to behave," Putin told hundreds of reporters at the Kremlin in a marathon event lasting a record 4 hours and 40 minutes. Political analysts have questioned how Medvedev would occupy Russia's all-powerful presidency and work effectively with his former boss as a subordinate. Putin will become prime minister because his United Russia party won a huge parliamentary majority in elections on Dec. 2 and controls the lower house of parliament. Russia's constitution assigns the prime minister a largely economic role, with all key security and power ministries reporting directly to the president. Putin, 55, said he and Medvedev would "divide our responsibilities and I can assure you that there will be no problem here". "The highest executive power in the country is the government of the Russian Federation headed by the Prime Minister," he added. Asked how long he would be premier, Putin said the post "cannot be transitional. As long as Medvedev was in the Kremlin and Putin was achieving his goals, "I would work as long as possible". Putin also addressed for the first time Western news reports that he had amassed a huge personal fortune while in power, dismissing the claims as "rubbish". Using typically colourful language, he said the reports were "just excavated from someone's nose and then spread on those bits of paper". On foreign policy, the Kremlin leader repeated warnings that Moscow would target Russian missiles at NATO countries which hosted parts of a planned U.S. missile defence shield and would strongly oppose independence for the Serb province of Kosovo. But overall, he struck a less aggressive tone than before, saying Moscow was more interested in dealing with social and economic problems at home than in pursuing a new Cold War arms race. "To suppose that we aspire to return to the times of the Cold War is just too bold a supposition," Putin said. Russia was willing to work "towards the construction of a positive dialogue" with whoever won the U.S. presidential election and did not intend to target any country with its nuclear missiles except in "extreme necessity", he said. ECONOMIC BOOM Speaking on a raised platform in front of a background decorated with Russia's national colours and flanked either side by two giant television screens, Putin began the news conference by reeling off statistics on Russia's economic boom, which has lasted throughout his eight years in the presidency. Real incomes, pensions and living standards had all risen dramatically, he said, though close attention needed to be paid to inflation, now running at around 12 percent a year. "I do not see any serious failures," Putin told a questioner. "All the tasks we set ourselves have been achieved". Officials said that a record 1,364 journalists were accredited for the news conference, which was carried live on state television across Russia. At four hours and 40 minutes, Thursday's news conference easily beat last year's three hours 32 minutes. Russian news agencies said Putin this year fielded 100 questio
