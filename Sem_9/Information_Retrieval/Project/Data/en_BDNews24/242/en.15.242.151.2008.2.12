 Dhaka, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com)Shipments of rice stranded for days on the other side of the border with India will start rolling into Bangladesh Wednesday, easing fears among people of a further rise in prices, an Indian business leader said. India has attached one condition: $500 in minimum prices per tonne. According to officials, Bangladesh businessmen opened L/Cs for more than two lakh tonnes of rice before India slapped restrictions on the exports of non-basmati varieties through private channels, effective from Feb 7. The ban stranded hundreds of trucks carrying shipments of 90,000 tonnes of rice on the other side of Benapole border, en route to Bangladesh. In an interview with BBC Radio, Tapan Chattapaddhay, director general of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations, said that the shipments with $500 in minimum prices per tonne would start moving into Bangladesh Wednesday. Tapan referred to a notice issued by the Indian finance ministry that gave clearance to the shipments. "There are no restrictions anymore on the exports of rice ($500 per tonne) to Bangladesh," he said. Tapan also said any shipment lower than the $500 minimum prices may run into snags. The leader of the business organisation said the L/Cs could be "amended" for releasing those shipments, without explaining how. Food adviser AMM Shawkat Ali told bdnews24.com that he was not officially informed about the latest developments in India. "But I got the news from BBC," he said. In an early development, five lakh tonnes of rice to be imported from India through the government channel will reach Bangladesh in 75 days from now, finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said Tuesday. The prices of rice to be imported through the government channel have been set at $399 per tonne on average. A proposal was approved at a meeting of the cabinet committee on public purchase Tuesday, chaired by the finance adviser at the secretariat. At a post-meeting news conference, the adviser said the government would use four routesroad, rail, river and seato bring in all the shipments, with 1.25 lakh tonnes of rice in each installment on each route. The shipment by sea will cost $414, and shipments carried by train and road will cost $388 per tonne. The shipment by river will be $400, the adviser said. "All the shipments will reach the country in 75 days from now," Azizul said. Replying to a question, the adviser said the foreign affairs ministry and the food ministry are jointly trying to talk the Indian government into withdrawing the ban on exports of non-Basmati rice through private channels. Indian high commissioner Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty said Monday that India was likely to approve shipments of rice against the L/Cs opened before Feb 7 by Bangladesh businessmen. In an interview with Voice of America, the Indian envoy said it seemed that there would be no problem about the L/Cs opened before Feb 7 when India imposed restrictions on the exports of non-basmati rice through private channels. bdnews
