 HONG KONG, June 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stock markets rose on Friday, with South Korea and Singapore setting records as worries about a slump in Chinese shares subsided, but the dollar held steady ahead of a key US payrolls report. European stocks were set to follow Asia's lead and financial bookmakers were calling for London's FTSE 100 index to open up 11 to 13 points. Higher risk-taking appetite weighed on safer assets such as Japanese government bonds, sending the benchmark 10-year yield to a seven-month high while the yen plumbed a fresh 15-year low against the higher-yielding Australian dollar. Gold extended its rebound to a 1-1/2-week high just above $663 an ounce while London Brent crude oil hovered above $68 a barrel after snapping a four-day losing streak when data showed US crude inventories fell last week. "Looking at the next two quarters, I'm still pretty bullish about Asian equities. Global growth continues to be pretty strong and we expect it to be better in the second half," said Mun Hon Tham, an analyst at ABN AMRO. Shanghai shares fell more than 3 percent in late trade but pared losses, remaining volatile after Wednesday's 6.5 percent slide triggered by a hike in a share trading tax -- the government's latest effort to cool a market that had nearly tripled in value since last May. Traders said the market was unnerved by rumours that the government planned to impose a stock capital gains tax. Many analysts, however, felt such a tax was unlikely as the market had been showing signs of cooling. Japan's Nikkei finished up 0.5 percent after briefly poking above 18,000 for the first time in three months as investors snapped up exporters such as Toyota Motor and Canon Inc following data pointing to a revival in US factory activity. Thailand's main stock index climbed 1.55 percent amid hopes that political tensions would ease after exiled former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra was banned from politics and his party dismantled for election fraud. South Korea's KOSPI ended 0.9 percent higher after earlier setting a new high as Samsung Electronics and Hynix Semiconductor jumped on hopes that prices for DRAM memory chips may have bottomed and following robust results from Dell Inc, the world's number two computer maker. The MSCI index of Asian stocks outside Japan advanced 1.1 percent by 0620 GMT, after also reaching an all-time high of 451.97. Among other major markets, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index added 0.3 percent thanks to gains in miners such as BHP Billiton and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index put on 0.8 percent. Singapore's Straits Times Index and the Philippine share market both touched new peaks. After having reached a three-month high near 122 yen, the dollar held just below that level as investors were reluctant to do much ahead of the influential non-farm payrolls data. "I think the jobs data itself is unlikely to provide a positive surprise to the market," said Osamu Takashima, chief analyst at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. The euro was also little changed at $1.3445 after clawing off a seven-week low of $1.3406 plumbed earlier this week. The US labour force report is expected to show an increase of 130,000 jobs in May, compared with 88,000 jobs created in April, while the jobless rate is seen unchanged at 4.5 percent. But the Australian dollar rose above 101 yen to fresh 15-year highs on yield-related buying as investors increased their appetite for riskier assets. Caution ahead of the jobs data saw US Treasuries ease in Asian trade, which in turn pressured Japanese government bonds. Lingering worries that the Bank of Japan could raise rates as early as August further helped drive the yield on the benchmark 10-year JGB up 3 basis points to a seven-month high of 1.775 percent
