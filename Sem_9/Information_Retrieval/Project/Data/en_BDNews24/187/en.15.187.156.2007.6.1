 SRINAGAR, India, June 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Separatist militants set off a bomb in Indian Kashmir's main city on Friday, wounding at least 10 soldiers in an army bus, the army said. (update) "They (militants) targeted an army convoy," Indian army spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel A K Mathur said. "The bus was damaged and most of them (soldiers) received minor injuries." Witnesses said the number of wounded was higher. No militant group has so far claimed responsibility for the blast, which occurred near a school in the heart of Srinagar, the summer capital of Kashmir. Earlier on Thursday three soldiers were wounded when their vehicle ran over a landmine near Sopore, north of Srinagar, police said. They said four suspected militants were killed in separate gun battles across the region in past 24 hours. Violence has flared up in Kashmir in recent weeks after the end of the winter, allowing easier movement of militants across the high mountain passes that divide Indian Kashmir and the Pakistani-controlled zone of the troubled region, officials say. However, overall violence levels remain significantly low compared to previous years, credited to a peace process between India and Pakistan, each of which claims the region in full but rules it only in parts. Indian officials say more than 42,000 people have been killed in Kashmir in the revolt against New Delhi's rule which erupted in 1989. Human rights groups put the toll at about 60,000 dead or missing
