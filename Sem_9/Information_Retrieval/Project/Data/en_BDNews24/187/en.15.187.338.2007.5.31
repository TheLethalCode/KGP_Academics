<TITLE> China blames media for food safety scaremongering </TITLE>

 BEIJING, May 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China blamed the media on Thursday for stoking fears about the safety of the nation's food and drugs, but senior officials acknowledged that it was not realistic to expect a 100 percent quality guarantee. They were reacting to a series of scandals that have plagued Chinese products, from poisoned cough syrup in Panama to tainted pet food in the United States, and shaken global confidence in the made-in-China label. "Recently, some media, actually quite a few, have wantonly reported on the so-called lack of safety of Chinese food products," said Li Yuanping, deputy head of the food safety import and export division of the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine. But more than 99 percent of Chinese food exports to the United States in the last three years had met quality standards, he told a news conference, slightly higher than the figure for US food exports to China in the past two years. "Looking at these statistics, you can see (media reports) have been whipped up," Li added. "One company's problems does not make it a China problem. If some food is below standard, you can't say all Chinese food is unsafe." Li spoke as the government announced the result of probes into how Chinese-made poisonous chemicals found their way into cough syrup and toothpaste in Central America. Panama says at least 100 people died after taking cough syrup which contained diethylene glycol -- an industrial solvent used in paint and antifreeze -- rather than the glycerine which was supposed to have been used. Wei Chuanzhong, deputy head of the quality and inspection bureau, said that two Chinese companies had mislabelled the chemical as a medical ingredient, but added that direct responsibility rested with Panamanian traders. A Chinese company shipped 11,349 kg of "TD" glycerine to Spain in 2003, where it was then sold on to Panama, said Wei. But that product actually contained 15 percent diethylene glycol, he added. Glycerine is a similar but more expensive compound frequently used as syrup in medicines and in toothpaste. Once in Panama, the product was renamed by Panamanian merchants as "pure glycerine". They also tweaked the expiry date to indicate that it would be valid for an extra three years, and sold it on, Wei added. "By the time the Panama drug manufacturer used the chemical, it had been expired for two years," he said. Nicaragua, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic and Panama have also pulled contaminated Chinese-made toothpaste from stores in recent weeks after tests showed high levels of diethylene glycol. The United States said last week it was checking all toothpaste shipments from China as a precautionary measure. Wei said that while the toothpaste in Central America did indeed contain the chemical, in small amounts it was harmless and nobody had been poisoned so far. "We hope that Panama and other countries take a scientific and pragmatic attitude, treat Chinese products properly and appropriately handle this incident," he said. China insists it has been responsible in dealing with the recent scandals, and does take food safety seriously. The reason it took so long for the government to hold a news conference and unveil the results of the investigation was because of the complexity of the case, and the fact it encompased three countries, Wei said. "The government pays a great deal of attention to food safety, and we will as always do our work well to protect global consumer safety," added Li. "But I must tell everyone, there is no 100 percent in food safety. An aeroplane may be the safest way to travel, but sometimes they can crash," he said
