 HELSINKI, May 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union will this week spell out to Serbia the exact steps needed for the country to clinch closer ties with the bloc, mainly by arresting war crimes fugitives, EU Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Thursday. Rehn told Reuters he would meet Serbian President Boris Tadic in Finland on Saturday to detail the EU's to-do list for Belgrade. "We will focus on the relationship between the EU and Serbia and what preconditions there are to restart the talks with Serbia and what the EU expects from Serbia once the talks resume," Rehn told Reuters. Talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement -- the first step on the long road to full EU membership -- were frozen a year ago after Belgrade failed to keep a promise to arrest former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic. The United Nations war crimes tribunal, which has indicted Mladic for genocide during the 1992-95 Bosnia war, says he is hiding in Serbia, aided by hardliners in the army and police. It has asked the EU to not give Serbia any leeway until Mladic is arrested. Rehn said the new government in Belgrade had committed itself to working with the war crimes body and "the talks can be resumed fairly soon." "We have calculated quite carefully that the negotiations would be finished within two to three months, once they have resumed," he said. "Within that timeframe, Serbia should reach full cooperation with The Hague War Tribunal, which would have to lead to the arrest of the war criminals." Rehn said he would discuss the matter with Germany, which holds the EU presidency, as well as with EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana and U.N. war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte. "After that I am sure we can move on quite swiftly," Rehn told reporters. Some EU countries remain strongly opposed to resuming talks with Serbia until it cooperates fully with the tribunal, while others are content to restart the talks, but condition the signing of the agreement on Mladic's arrest
