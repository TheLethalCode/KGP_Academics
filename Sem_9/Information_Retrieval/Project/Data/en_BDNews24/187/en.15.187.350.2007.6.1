<TEXT>
 LONDON, June 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's FTSE 100 share index edged higher on Friday, as M&A talk boosted Home Retail and Hammerson, dealers said, but economic concerns left some investors awaiting a raft of key US data due later in the session. Shares in British property firm Hammerson rose 2 percent as traders cited talk of bid interest from rival British Land. Hammerson, which declined to comment, has been dogged by bid speculation and said last month the company was not for sale. British Land was up 0.6 percent. Home Retail Group rose 2.4 percent, also helped by renewed bid talk, traders said. By 1058 GMT the FTSE 100 was up 10.6 points, or 0.16 percent at 6,632, extending the previous session's gains. "We've had a solid day today ... generally the upward trend is very much in place," said Peter Dixon, UK economist at Commerzbank. Investors hoping to gauge the health of the world's biggest economy eyed the US Labor Department's May employment report, and the Commerce Department's release of April personal income and consumption data, both due at 1230 GMT. The market also awaited the US Institute for Supply Management's May manufacturing index and the National Association of Realtors' Pending Home Sales Index for April, both at 1400 GMT. "There does appear to be a sense that the US economy is not going to crash land, and subsequently I think that's one of those factors that has been supporting equities over recent weeks," Commerzbank's Dixon said. "We have a situation where U.S markets clearly appear to be defying gravity, bringing the rest of the world with them," he added. PUNCH UP Punch Taverns added 2.5 percent after Goldman Sachs raised its price target. Cable & Wireless put on 1.6 percent after ABN AMRO raised its price target. ITV rose 1.1 percent after the Times newspaper said ITV1's advertising revenues are on track to increase in July -- the first time the commercial broadcaster has shown growth outside the World Cup since 2005. Utilities weighed, with Centrica leading the FTSE 100 losers with a 2 percent fall after one of the operators at the firm said an apparent gas leak caused the gas import terminals at Easington in England to shut down on Friday morning. Power station operator Drax shed 1.2 percent and United Utilities also fell. Oil major BP shed 0.6 percent as crude oil eased below $68 a barrel after the restart of a major Nigerian oil pipeline, offsetting an unexpected fall in US crude supplies
