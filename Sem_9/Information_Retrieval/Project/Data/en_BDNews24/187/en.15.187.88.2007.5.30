 LONDON, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Northern Foods, maker of Goodfella's pizzas and Fox's biscuits, said on Wednesday the rising costs of making biscuits and the iron grip of supermarkets on prices were weighing on the firm's profits. Northern Foods, which also makes sandwiches and ready meals for Marks and Spencer, posted an expected pretax profit of 40 million pounds ($79.5 million) on revenue of 888.5 million pounds. The firm, which has sold off 40 percent of its business over the past year, was expected to post pretax profit of 40 million pounds, according to the average forecast given by 12 analysts polled by Reuters Estimates. Including the sell-off costs Northern made a 22.5 million-pound loss, while the firm's operating margin dropped to 6.6 percent from 6.8 percent, hit by higher raw material costs and large supermarkets squeezing suppliers to keep down prices. The Leeds-based company said rising raw material costs were causing problems for its biscuits business. "You are looking at a 4 or 5 million pounds impact," Finance director Jez Maiden told reporters. Profits and margins from its frozen and bakery divisions also fell. Northern Foods parted company with Chief Executive Pat O'Driscoll in February after she failed to steer the firm out of the doldrums despite selling off its most troublesome businesses. Despite its recent preference to sell off difficult businesses, recently installed chief executive Stefan Barden told reporters that it would not to do the same with the biscuits unit. "We plan to keep the business. Clearly, if someone came in with an extremely high offer we would consider it but we see it as a profit opportunity for ourselves." Barden added that the firm expected to see some overall growth through the year. "We are looking for steady progression. Low single digits" The results got a mixed reception from analysts. "The results showed good progress in the problematic chilled division but falling profits and margins in the frozen and bakery divisions," said analysts at Goldman Sachs. "The outlook statement suggests that the company expects to make further progress in sales and profits but we are somewhat cautious given falling margins in two out of the three divisions and the reference to higher costs," they added. Shares in the firm which have risen almost 40 percent in the last year, opened little changed at 131-1/4 pence, valuing the business at around 650 million pounds
