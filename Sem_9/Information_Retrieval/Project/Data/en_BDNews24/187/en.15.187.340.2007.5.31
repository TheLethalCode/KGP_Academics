 Dhaka, May 31 (bdnews24.com) -- The Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) has been permitted to import lentil, edible oil and gram to keep prices stable. Food adviser Tapan Chowdhury told journalists at his office Thursday that the BDR would import these essential commodities. However, commodities, whose prices in the international market did not differ much from those in the local wholesale market, would be collected locally." Before Ramadan, the government is to purchase commodities from importers and sell them across the country thorough the OMS dealers. These commodities will include rice, lentil, oil and onion. The adviser said, "To keep the rice market stable, the government will start selling rice in the open market one month ahead of Ramadan. The government has decided to import rice alongside procuring the item from the local market." He said that one lakh tonnes of rice had already reached the country and that letters of credit for two lakh tonnes more had been opened. Besides, 12 lakh tonnes of rice would be procured from the local market. Food ministry sources said that the government had decided to release two to three lakh tonnes of rice through open market sales (OMS). Commerce ministry sources said that the restriction on weight regarding transportation of commodities by truck was being lifted in phases.
