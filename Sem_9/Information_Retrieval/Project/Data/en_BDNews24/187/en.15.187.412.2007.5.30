 HONG KONG, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hong Kong blue chips fell 0.9 percent on Wednesday, tracking a slide in mainland equities after Beijing hiked the stock trading tax, and sparking near-record volume amid a broad-based sell-off led by mainland financial plays. On a day that mood -- not any change in fundamentals -- drove investors to the door, Hong Kong-listed shares in mainland companies declined 2 percent. "H shares fell in sentiment with the A shares," said Khiem Do, head of Asia Multi-assets at Baring Asset Management. "We're still positive on China. But if China continues to rise strongly over the next few months, it's possible that the government would impose harsher measures, like the capital gains tax." The weak market conditions undercut the Hong Kong listing by Chinese book publisher and retailer Sichuan Xinhua Winshare Chainstore, which fizzled after pricing its US$275 million IPO at the top of a range. Shares in Hong Kong property developers also underperformed the broad market on worries that banks could raise their lending rates following higher interbank rates. China's main stock index closed down 6.5 percent after Beijing raised the stamp tax to 0.3 percent from 0.1 percent in a bid to to cool a speculative market. The benchmark Hang Seng Index finished down 175.83 points to end at 20,293.76, its lowest close in nearly two months. It hit a four-week intraday low. The China Enterprises index of H shares, or Hong Kong-listed shares in mainland companies, fell 212.01 points to 10,403.44, earlier having hit four-week lows. Turnover was the sixth highest-ever at HK$75.6 billion (US$9.7 billion). In the near-term, most analysts said there could be more downside for the H shares given the domestic A-share market may correct further. "A shares could be soft for a few weeks," said Erwin Sanft, research director at BNP Paribas. "This could be a good buying opportunity for both A and H shares." Mainland financial stocks were the biggest drag on the H shares. Shares in China Life, the day's most active, slid 3.3 percent to HK$23.70. Rival Ping An tumbled nearly 3 percent to HK$43.65. China Construction Bank slumped 2.1 percent to HK$4.58. Sichuan Xinhua Winshare Chainstore settled at HK$5.55 for a 4.3 percent loss over its IPO price of HK$5.80 per share, though it ended near the high end of the day's range, having traded as low as HK$5.07. Among Hong Kong developers, Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd fell 1.8 percent to HK$99.95 and Sun Hung Kai Properties dropped 1.4 percent to HK$90. Luks Industrial (Group) Ltd dived 6.1 percent to HK$13.50 after major shareholders sold 70.5 million shares at HK$12.80 each, raising HK$902.4 million (US$115.7 million), according to a term sheet obtained by Reuters on Wednesday.
