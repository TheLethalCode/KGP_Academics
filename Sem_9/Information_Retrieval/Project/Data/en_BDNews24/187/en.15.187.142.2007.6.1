<TITLE> No sign Iran to drop atom work after talks-Rice </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MADRID, June 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said on Friday she saw no evidence Iran was willing to freeze sensitive nuclear activity following talks between Tehran and the European Union. Arriving in Madrid, where the EU's Javier Solana and Iran's Ali Larijani met a day earlier, Rice said she had not yet been briefed on the substance of the exploratory meeting. "But I hope they were constructive. The only question is: are we getting to a point where the Iranians are prepared to suspend so that negotiations can begin?," she said. "I don't see any evidence of it but I frankly haven't had a chance to speak to Javier (Solana) since the talks concluded." The talks produced no breakthrough on the core dispute -- Iran's refusal to suspend uranium enrichment as a precondition for negotiations on trade benefits, despite the spectre of a third round of punitive UN sanctions against it. But Solana said Iran indicated more willingness to cooperate with UN watchdog inquiries into the nature its programme, which Tehran says is solely for electricity generation but which Western powers suspect is a front for building atom bombs.
