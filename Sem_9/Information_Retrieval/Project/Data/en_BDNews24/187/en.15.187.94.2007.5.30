 NEW DELHI, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's main communist party, which props up the ruling coalition, urged the government on Wednesday to establish a licensing system for organised retail business and prevent the entry of foreign players like Wal-Mart. It also reiterated that the government should abandon moves to permit foreign investment in the retail sector through what it said was the "backdoor". "The Communist Party of India (Marxist) proposes a system of licensing should be introduced for organised retail," the party said in a statement. "In addition the ... government should also abandon the move to permit foreign direct investment in retail trade through the back door as in the case of the joint venture between Wal-Mart and Bharti Enterprises." India's Bharti group and Wal-Mart aim to set up an equal joint venture for cash-and-carry business in India's fragmented $300 billion retail industry. The sector is dominated by small family-run stores and is forecast to more than double in size by 2015
