 SRINAGAR, India, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian soldiers shot dead three suspected militants overnight as they tried to sneak into Indian Kashmir from the Pakistani side, the latest in rising infiltration attempts, the army said on Wednesday. It was the fourth attempted incursion in the last eight days and indicated an increase in efforts by separatist guerrillas to take advantage of falling snow levels on the high mountain passes connecting the two Kashmirs, a spokesman said. The latest incident took place in the Poonch region of southern Kashmir, the army spokesman said. "The troops challenged the infiltrators leading to a gun battle near the LoC which lasted over two hours," he said, referring to the Line of Control as the military frontier separating the two Kashmirs is called. There has been a spurt in militant violence in Indian Kashmir in recent weeks with the end of winter, although overall violence levels remain significantly low compared to previous years, credited to a peace process between India and Pakistan. Both countries claim the region in full but rule it in parts. India says Pakistan has not done enough to curb Islamist militants operating from it soil, a charge Islamabad rejects. Indian officials say more than 42,000 people have been killed in Kashmir in the revolt against New Delhi's rule which erupted in 1989. Human rights groups put the toll at about 60,000 dead or missing. bd
