<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 2 (bdnews24.com)  A new political party, likely to be styled Bangladesh Democratic Party or BDP, is set to break into the political landscape in July amid widespread speculations that the military-backed government is helping a group of politicians float a new platform. Several leaders involved with the policy formulation have confirmed to bdnews24.com about the looming launch. The party would be formally floated into the political mainstream once the ban on parlour politics is lifted, at least two of the leaders said. These two mentioned the name BDP, but refused to acknowledge it on record. Political leaders of different hues have been holding a frenzy of meetings to put final touches to the make and vision of the new party with umbrella being its symbol. A party source said as many as eight meetings have been held in Dhaka in the last three weeks. Leaders from the Big Two the Awami League and BNPand other political parties including Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Jatiya Party (JP), Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (JSD) and National Awami Party (NAP) are set to join the party, sources said. Bigger chunks of the JP, except former president HM Ershad and Kazi Zafar, the LDP, leaving former president AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury and retired colonel Oli Ahmed, would join the party. Besides, a good number of former Awami League and BNP lawmakers would join the party, the sources said. Primarily, a 15-member nucleus committee has been formed as unlike others, the BDP, as it has been initially styled, would not have all powers with a single party chief. The committee includes former ministers Sheikh Shahidul Islam (JP-Monju), Kazi Firoz Rashid (JP) and Tajul Islam Chowdhury (JP), former whip Ashraf Hossain (BNP), former state minister Anwarul Kabir Talukder (LDP), former BNP state minister Alamgir Kabir (LDP), former JP state minister Noor Mohammad Khan (LDP), former state minister for foreign affairs Abul Hasan Chowdhury, who has resigned from Awami League, former BNP leader and JP state minister Kamrun Nahar Zafar, and former NAP leader Abdul Hai. Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Janata League general secretary Fazlur Rahman, former DUCSU vice president and president of East Pakistan Student League Ferdous Ahmed Quraishi and former lawmaker MM Shahin (BNP)are also on the committee. The committee is preparing a draft constitution and manifesto, the sources said. "The new party will pursue nationalistic politics. We are working to form the party uniting patriotic, progressive and democratic forces," Noor Mohammad Khan, a committee member, told bdnews24.com. "The aim of the party is to remove the barriers to make Bangladesh a developed country. The previous governments under the dynastic leadership established a reign of corruption and criminalisation. "As a result the fate of the common people did not change. Inefficient and dishonest people using dynastic rule made fabulous money illegally through sycophancy and corruption." Khan, a front ranking leader of the 11-point movement of 1969, sounded upbeat that the culture of criminalisation in the guise of politics would end forever. He said in the last 15 years the people who plundered state wealth and dived into pervasive corrupt dominated in the BNP and the Awami League. The Awami League cares little for the people and has moved far from its fundamental principles, he said. The influence of the rightist, reactionary groups has reduced the nationalist forces in the BNP, Khan said. He claimed the party, scheduled for a formal launch once indoor politics is allowed, would neither be pro-left nor right-leaning and would rather work as a centrist liberal nationalist party. "I will surely be in a party where muscle power and black money would not dominate and would have efficient and honest leadership," Kazi Firoz Rashid said. "I think people aspire for a new party in the current situation because of criminalisation and corruption of society." bdnews2
