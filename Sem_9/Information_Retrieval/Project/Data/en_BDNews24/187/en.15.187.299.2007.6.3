 SINGAPORE, June 03 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Defense Secretary Robert Gates urged Turkey on Sunday against using military force against Kurdish separatist forces in northern Iraq amid rising tensions in the border region. "We would prefer that we continue to work through this problem with them to try and safeguard Turkey, and hope that there would not be a unilateral military action across the border into Iraq," Gates told a news briefing at an Asian security conference in Singapore. Troop movements on Turkey's southeastern border have prompted speculation of a possible incursion into Iraq's largely autonomous northern Kurdistan region. Last week, Turkey moved tanks near to the Iraqi border after bomb attacks killed 12 Turks. Ankara swiftly blamed the Kurdistan Workers Party for the bombings and said its troop movement was routine. "The Turks have a genuine concern with Kurdish terrorism," Gates said. "We have been working with the Turks to try and help them get control of this problem on Turkish soil." Asked whether US pressure for a non-military response was being heeded in Ankara, Gates said he thought so. "We have had ongoing discussions with Turkish officials," he said. "General Ralston is our envoy to Turkey and he continues to be deeply engage." Joseph Ralston is a retired air force general and Washington's special envoy to deal with Kurdish separatism. Iraq's prime minister also urged Turkey over the weekend not to send its troops into northern Iraq, urging Ankara to tone down its threats of military intervention.
