<TEXT>
 LONDON, June 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England have named an unchanged team for the third test against the West Indies at Old Trafford, Manchester, starting on Thursday. Nottinghamshire left-armer Ryan Sidebottom retains his place following his eight-wicket haul against the West Indies at Headingley in the record innings victory that helped England to a 1-0 lead in the four-test series. Pacemen Matthew Hoggard and Sajid Mahmood as well as all-rounder Andrew Flintoff were all unavailable through injury, but batsmen Ian Bell has been passed fit. "Ian Bell has made excellent progress after suffering a back spasm that saw him sit out the last four days of the second test," chairman of selectors David Graveney said in a statement on Sunday. "Provided he gets through Warwickshire's Friends Provident Trophy match on Sunday, he's expected to be fully fit for Old Trafford. "James Anderson has not been named in the squad but will be the standby seam bowler, joining the team on Wednesday evening in case of late illness or injury." Commenting on Flintoff's injury, Graveney said: "Andrew successfully underwent surgery on Friday and following rehabilitation and strengthening work we are hopeful he can play a part for England at some stage later in the summer." England team: Michael Vaughan (captain), Ian Bell, Paul Collingwood, Alastair Cook, Stephen Harmison, Monty Panesar, Kevin Pietersen, Matthew Prior, Liam Plunkett, Ryan Sidebottom, Andrew Straus
