 Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com) -- A Dhaka court Wednesday sent Awami League presidium member Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim into three-day remand and ex-FBCCI president Abdul Awal Mintoo into four days of interrogation in police custody. The same court sent Barisal city mayor Majibar Rahman Sarwar into jail after he was arrested in Dhaka. He faces charges of corruption and abuse of power in a general diary filed with Gulshan Police Station. Selim, Mintoo and Sarwar were the latest to face orders from a Dhaka court after they were arrested with corruption links in the army-backed government's anticorruption crackdown. The arrestees were taken to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka at 3.35pm. A huge crowd gathered on the court premises to see the arrestees, bdnews24.com legal affairs correspondent Prakash Biswas reported from the scene. Joint forces arrested Selim and Mintoo early Tuesday. Selim faces allegations of spinning off huge wealth through the abuse of power as minister when the Awami League was in office. Mintoo faces similar charges of making a huge amount of money when he was the president of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Earlier in an hour's span Monday, the joint forces arrested AL general secretary Abdul Jalil, BNP leader and former state minister Lutfozzaman Babar and Partex Group chairman and former BNP lawmaker MA Hashem. bdnew
