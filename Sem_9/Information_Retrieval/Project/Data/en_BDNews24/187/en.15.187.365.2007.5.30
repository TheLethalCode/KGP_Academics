<TEXT>
 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com) -- Warid Telecom is planning sell minority stake of its mobile phone business in Pakistan, reported Reuters and Pakistan's the Daily Times last week. "Warid has been approached by several international telecom companies over the last six or eight months, including those from the Far East, the Middle East and Europe," said a Warid source. It said the company was talking to several offshore buyers including Singapore's SingTel, Britain's Vodafone Group and Kuwait's Mobile Telecommunications Co (MTC). "But no final decision has been taken as yet," he said. "The picture will become clear by July or August." Subsequently Warid's source also told Pakistan's the Daily Times, "The management is not willing to sell its controlling stake or brand name as Warid is standing on third position among its competitors (In Pakistan)." Quoting a Warid's spokeswoman Reuters said, "Anything which is going on is between the sponsors and the interested parties and the management of Warid is not involved. But there is nothing concrete to say at the moment." Value of this deal is unknown and it also remains unclear if Warid will sell part of its existing shares or issue fresh equity. Meanwhile, SingTel promptly denied its interest in buying minority stake in Warid Telecom. "We do not comment on market rumours," SingTel's senior corporate communication manager Andrienne Tho told the Daily Times of Pakistan. But neither British Vodafone nor Kuwaiti MTC has contested this report. bdn
