 PARIS, May 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former champion Anastasia Myskina's French Open challenge lasted just 38 forgettable minutes after she was embarrassed 6-1 6-0 in the first round by American Meghann Shaughnessy on Wednesday. Myskina, the first Russian woman to lift a grand slam title when she triumphed in 2004, almost skipped the tournament due to injuries and a wretched run of form. Making her comeback after undergoing foot surgery in January, the Russian probably wished she had not shown up after her painful experience on court 16. "I have to be a realist. I knew I was not going to win but I just wanted to see how my foot would feel," Myskina told reporters. "You can see I'm moving like a big cow now." Myskina, once ranked as high as second in the world, is now floundering at 51 and has not won a match since reaching the final in Stockholm last August. She stubbed her big toe during her run in Sweden and feared the injury could mean the end of her career. "The doctor basically told me that he's not sure if I would get back on court after the surgery, because it's the foot, it's difficult," said the Muscovite. "In my mind, I'm still scared to run... and this is a line I have to cross." Should the injury force her into premature retirement, the 25-year-old has already mapped out her future plans. "I had the great life these five months in Moscow, so I know how it's going to be after tennis," she said. "I was working on TV. I had a soccer show on TV. I have no idea about soccer but now I'm kind of into that. I was also commentating on tennis. I had a great life. I don't know why I'm here." Shaughnessy's reward for the win will be a second-round date with another Russian, third seed Svetlana Kuznetsov
