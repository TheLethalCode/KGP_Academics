 Dhaka, June 3 (bdnews24.com) -- The Dhaka Stock Exchange recorded Tk 2.06 billion in turnover Sunday, the highest in the history of the country's prime bourse. Increased participation of institutional investors and a surge in transactions of shares of banks and power companies spurred the turnover. "It's a milestone for us. The market also looked good as the prices of issues closed mixed amid investors' cautious response to the market," said Salahuddin Ahmed Khan, chief executive of the DSE. Sunday's position in turnover breached the previous benchmark at Tk 1.78 billion, recorded on May 27. Ahmed attributed the surge in turnover to the higher participation of institutional investors such as banks and financial institutions in trading. The DSE chief however pointed to the risks of price escalation due to excess demand created in the market recently. "If the supply of quality shares cannot increase in line with soaring demand, prices may go up. This is risky for the market," he said. Ahmed suggested an immediate offloading of shares of state-run enterprises. Power stocks gained after the government sanctioned a 16 percent of the total annual development programme for fiscal 2007-08. Bank stocks closed mixed. On Thursday, total turnover was Tk 1.70 billion on the DSE. Turnover on the Chittagong Stock Exchange stood at Tk 302.91 million. The DGEN or general index closed at 2007.04, up 3.46 points or 0.17 percent. The DSI or all-share price index advanced 1.43 points or 0.08 percent to 1659.79. The DSE-20 blue-chip index shed 10.36 points or 0.57 percent to 1784.30. All the indices on the CSE except for CSE-30 selected index advanced. "The market behaviour looks matured," said Ahmad Rashid Lali, vice-president of DSE. Rashid linked the recent upbeat mood in the market to stable and good indicators of the economy. "Economic indicators are stable and good enough to have a buoyant market," he said. Power Grid Company of Bangladesh, BRAC Bank, Prime Bank, Southeast Bank and Square Pharma led the turnover board. Power Grid recorded Tk 279.76 million in turnover and added 4.82 percent to Tk 619.25 on buying pressure. BRAC Bank dropped 5.71 percent to end at Tk 738.75. Prime Bank slumped 3.99 percent to Tk 799.25. Southeast Bank declined 4.62 percent to Tk 438. Expectations for attractive dividends drove Square Pharma 0.36 percent to Tk 3746.
