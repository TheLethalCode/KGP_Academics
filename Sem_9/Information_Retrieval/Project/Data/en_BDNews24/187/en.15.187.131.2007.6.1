 DUBAI, June 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - BBC Gaza correspondent Alan Johnston said in an Internet video issued by his captors on Friday that they had treated him well. The video, posted on an Islamist Web site, is the first tangible evidence that Johnston, who disappeared on March 12, was alive up to that point after being kidnapped. (update) "First of all, my captors have treated me very well," Johnston said on the video issued by the Army of Islam which last claimed responsibility for his kidnapping in March. The group repeated its demand on the video for Britain to free Muslim prisoners, particularly the Islamist cleric Abu Qatada. In London, a British Foreign Office spokesman said: "We are urgently trying to check out the reports." Abu Qatada, a radical Islamic cleric suspected of close links to al Qaeda, has been described by the British government as a "significant international terrorist". He is one of more than a dozen Arab men whom Britain has been holding under detention or house arrest as threats to national security, while acknowledging that it does not have sufficient evidence to put them on trial. The recording was posted on an Islamist Web site often used by al Qaeda and other militant groups, and was accompanied by what appeared to be a picture of Johnston's BBC staff card
