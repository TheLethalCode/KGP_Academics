The adviser is expected to sign a Memorandum of Understanding on manpower export to South Korea with that country's labour minister next week. Chowdhury leaves Dhaka Saturday for Seoul to attend the "Asia Co-operation Dialogue" June 4 to 6. Chowdhury said the MoU would help boost facilities for Bangladeshi workers in South Korea and relations between the countries would be stronger if the 12000 illegal workers collected necessary documents. These workers had worked in South Korea and acquired skills and proficiency in the Korean language and that was why they would get government priority to get back to South Korea, he said. Foreign ministers from 30 countries would share their experiences in development fields at the Asia Co-operation Dialogue. Bangladesh will discuss poverty alleviation, women empowerment and right to loan. The foreign adviser will hold meetings with foreign, commerce and labour ministers of South Korea and the foreign minister of Russia.
