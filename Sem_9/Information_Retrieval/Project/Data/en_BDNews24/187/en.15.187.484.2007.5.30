 BEIJING, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese shares slumped 6.5 percent on Wednesday even as the World Bank revised its growth forecasts sharply higher and Moody's Investors Service flagged an upgrade to the country's credit rating. The Shanghai Composite Index of A-shares ended at 4,053.088 points. It had fallen as much as 7.4 percent at one point on a wave of selling triggered by a tripling in the stamp tax to 0.3 percent. The announcement, made after midnight, was the latest in a series of official steps -- including increases in interest rates and banks' reserve requirements this month -- to cool a market that by Tuesday's close had climbed 62 percent this year to a record high. The index had already risen 130 percent in 2006, making Shanghai the best-performing major bourse in the world. With some 300,000 brokerage accounts being opened every day, policy makers are anxious to let some air out of the market because of concern that an army of novice investors could suffer heavy losses in the event of a meltdown. Analysts said that, by targeting the speculators who have accounted for the bulk of turnover in recent weeks, the tax increase could hurt prices in the short term. But they did not expect the market to crash or reverse a long-term uptrend. "The index will find a short-term floor at 3,900 to 4,000 points and resume rising after a correction of around three days," predicted Zhang Yanbing, an analyst at Kinghing Securities. Because shares account for a small share of household wealth, analysts do not expect a sharp correction to make much of a dent in the world's fourth-largest economy. "Even a 20 percent correction in the A shares should have very limited impact on the real economy," said Frank Gong, chief China economist at JPMorgan Securities in Hong Kong. The World Bank agreed. "The main impact could be damage to the new-found confidence in the Chinese capital market. The impact on the real economy via reduced consumption and investment is likely to remain limited," the bank said in its latest quarterly update on China's economy. In a generally favourable report card, the bank raised its forecast for 2007 gross domestic product growth to 10.4 percent from 9.6 percent in its February report. The upgrade followed strong annual growth of 11.1 percent in the first quarter, driven by net exports and investment. However, the report said that from the macroeconomic perspective, China's economy does not appear to be overheating. "Overall, demand and supply are now growing broadly in line with each other, which explains low core inflation and the absence of current account deficits and systemic bottlenecks in the real economy," the bank said. The key issue facing policy makers is that a fat chunk of demand is coming from abroad, which requires policies to rebalance the economy, including fiscal, labour market, pricing policies and a stronger exchange rate, the bank said. "This means there is no obvious need for macro policies to tighten demand in the real economy," the report said. Moody's Investors Service also gave China the thumb's-up, placing its A2 credit rating on review for a possible upgrade. "China's strong external payments position provides insulation from external shocks and allows the authorities time to expand and deepen structural reform," Tom Byrne, a vice president of Moody's, said in a statement. Structural reforms, notably removing a massive overhang of non-tradable state-owned shares, lie at the heart of the resurgence in the stock market over the past two years. But analysts say China has a lot to do to bring market regulation, supervision and governance up to international standards. In a step in that direction, the government said it would impose administrative penalties on a number of companies involved in the backdoor listing of GF Securities, a Guangzhou brokerage. "The government is sending out a clear message to the market. It wants to clamp down on stock speculation and insider trading," said a top fund manager at a Sino-foreign mutual fund house. In another policy shift that could speed up the introduction of best practice, China plans to open the securities sector wider to overseas investors before the end of 2007, state media reported. Newspapers quoted Tu Guangshao, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, as saying the ceilings on foreign stakes in domestic brokerages and joint ventures, now 20 percent and 33 percent respectively, would be gradually raised
