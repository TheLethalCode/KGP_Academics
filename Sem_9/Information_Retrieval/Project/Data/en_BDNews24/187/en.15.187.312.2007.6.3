 Dhaka, June 3 (bdnews24.com)The Commonwealth Parliamentary Association has said its executive committee meeting in New Delhi will decide the fate of Bangladesh that lost its membership of the association. "In accordance with the Article 6 (2) (a) of the CPA constitution, your (Speaker's) request will be presented to the executive committee at its meeting in Delhi," CPA secretary-general William F Shija said in a letter written to Speaker Jamiruddin Sircar on May 30. The date for the Delhi meeting is yet to be fixed, parliament sources said Sunday. On May 9, Sircar sent a letter to the CPA headquarters requesting a review of the association's decision of suspending Bangladesh from the body. In the first week of May, the CPA suspended the membership of Bangladesh, as there was no elected parliament in the country. bdn
