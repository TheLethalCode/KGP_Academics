 DUBLIN, May 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bank of Ireland posted a 22 percent rise in full-year earnings on Thursday and pledged to further reduce costs as it predicted a slower rate of profit growth this year. Underlying earnings per share (EPS) in the year to end March rose to 144.6 cents from 118.5 cents a year earlier, compared with the average forecast of 144.8 cents in a poll of 17 analysts conducted by Reuters Estimates. Ireland's third-biggest listed company, with a market value of 16.3 billion euros ($22.0 billion), had said in a March trading update that it was set to meet EPS market expectations. "We are guiding a low double-digit percentage growth in underlying EPS for the year to 31 March, 2008," the company said on Thursday. Goodbody analyst Eamonn Hughes said the results and outlook were both broadly in line with what he had been expecting, though a dividend increase of 15 percent was more than he had forecast. "Provisionally, our estimates showing 11 percent EPS growth from a forecast 1 cent higher than they produced remains unchanged," he wrote in a research note. Hughes said the potential for upgrades to earnings forecasts looked limited, given Ireland's cooling property market. While that meant Bank of Ireland shares should probably not trade at a premium to European rivals, they looked undervalued. "On provisional numbers, the stock is now trading on 9.5 times calendar 2008 earnings, putting it on a 10 percent discount to its UK and European peers," he said. Shares in Bank of Ireland, which had already fallen 12 percent from an all-time high of 18.83 euros in February amid jitters over Ireland's once booming property market, were down 1.6 percent at 16.25 euros by 0839 GMT in a rising Irish market . Bank of Ireland Chief Executive Brian Goggin said on Thursday that slowing house price growth in Ireland was "really good news", however, and its impact on the Bank of Ireland had been "totally and utterly misrepresented". Goggin told reporters commentators had not told a "rounded story" following a recent cooling in the property market, meaning some investors had not taken into account the bright outlook for Ireland's economy and its fast-growing population. "Headlines grab attention, people are busy; how prepared are they to drill into the numbers?" he said. "If you go back in time, it took external commentators many, many years to accept that the 'Celtic tiger' (economy) wasn't just a figment of somebody's imagination." Goggin said he expected the bank's mortgage loan book to grow 15 to 16 percent this year and into the medium term after 22 percent growth in the 12 months to the end of March 2007. On cost cutting, the bank said it had reduced its cost-to-income ratio by 3 percentage points to 54 percent last year and expected efficiency to improve still further to reach a percentage in the mid-40s over the medium term
