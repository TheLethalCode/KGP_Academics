 MUMBAI, June 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Indian court jailed a Bollywood producer for nine years on Friday for supplying actor Sanjay Dutt an illegal rifle he got from gangsters connected with India's worst bombings in 1993. Samir Hingora, who also ran a video tape company, gave an automatic rifle to the top Bollywood star after procuring it from the crime mafia blamed for the attacks in India's financial capital which killed 257 people. The court also fined Hingora 200,000 rupees ($5,000). Judge PD Kode also sentenced a man to life and three people to jail for between eight and 13 years for crimes such as planning and transporting the explosives used in the attacks. With Friday's convictions, 63 people have been sentenced to varying jail terms and fines after one of the world's longest trials ended last year. Dutt, 47, is the most high-profile of the 100 convicted in the bombings. He was found guilty of illegal possession of arms. No date has been set for his order. Those sentenced so far include smugglers, petty criminals and also policemen and customs officials who took bribes to let the explosives through. An 83-year-old man is among those jailed for life for planning the blasts. Police say the bomb attacks were ordered by India's most wanted crime boss, Dawood Ibrahim, a Muslim, who wanted to avenge the razing of a 16th century mosque by Hindu zealots in 1992.
