<TITLE> Barca angry at letting slip lead in title race says Messi </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MADRID, June 2 (bdnew24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona forward Lionel Messi has said he is disappointed and angry at the way the team has let slip their advantage in the Spanish title race. "The truth is it makes me really angry to see where we are now," the 19-year-old Argentine told the Barcelona-based daily Sport on Saturday. "We've given up a really important lead. Everything was in our hands and we weren't capable of consolidating the leadership." Barcelona enjoyed a handy four-point lead over Sevilla at the top of the table in mid-April, but defeat at Villarreal and a draw at home to Real Betis mean that they now lie in second spot behind Real Madrid with just two games to go. "The players are angry, but still determined. Our pride has been hurt and I just hope that our reaction hasn't come too late." The Argentina international said he was still holding out hope that Real would come unstuck in their next league match against fifth-placed Real Zaragoza. "I'm sure that Zaragoza will beat Real," he said. "I know from experience that La Romareda is a very difficult stadium to play at and they are still playing for a place in next season's UEFA Cup." Barca are at home to city rivals Espanyol in their next league match on June 10, but they will have to make do without the inspirational Ronaldinho who is suspended after being sent off in their 1-0 victory over Getafe last weeken
