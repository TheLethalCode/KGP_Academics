 LONDON, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese stocks tumbled more than 6 percent on Wednesday after China tripled a share-trading tax to cool its red-hot market, buffeting Asian and European markets but failing to trigger the broad rout some had feared. Currencies were relatively steady and demand for euro zone government bonds rose slightly. China's Ministry of Finance raised stamp duty on share transactions to 0.3 from 0.1 percent in what was seen as the strongest attempt yet to curb speculation in a market that had risen more than 60 percent so far this year. The move -- and accompanying 6.48 percent loss on the Shanghai main index -- depressed European stocks. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 0.6 percent. London's FTSE 100 index and Frankfurt's DAX dropped 0.8 percent and Paris' CAC 40 shed 0.7 percent. Investors have feared a sharp fall in China could ripple through financial markets as it did in late February. "This could trigger a correction, but we don't see a change in the overall trend," said Thomas Gruener, an analyst at Landesbank Berlin. "The environment for equities is still very good." Earlier, Tokyo's Nikkei closed down 0.5 percent, while MSCI's index of Asian regional shares outside Japan was down 1 percent. The Nikkei lost 84.30 points at 17,588.26, while the broader TOPIX index slipped 0.2 percent to 1,733.75. The low-yielding Japanese yen ticked slightly higher against the euro as the fall in Chinese stocks made investors nervous about risky carry trades. But the dollar held steady against the euro and yen ahead of the release of minutes of the Federal Reserve's last policy meeting. "The dollar is still rather well supported by a change we have seen in interest rate expectations. The minutes will show they have flexibility but are concerned about inflation. We still think they will not cut interest rates." said Marcus Hettinger, global FX strategist at Credit Suisse in Zurich. The euro was down around 0.2 percent at 163.42 yen having hit an all-time high around 164.30 on Tuesday. The euro was down less than 0.1 percent at $1.3436, inching back toward its six-week low of $1.3410 hit last week. The dollar was flat at 121.62 yen after hitting a three-month high around 121.90 yen last week. Demand for euro zone government debt rose. "A modest boost to bonds from weaker Chinese equities, but with volumes very thin, this is more about price mark-up for bonds than outright flight to safety," said a bond trader in London. The 10-year Bund yield was down 2.1 basis points to yield 4.378 percent, pulling away from a three-year high of 4.408 percent struck on Tuesday intraday
