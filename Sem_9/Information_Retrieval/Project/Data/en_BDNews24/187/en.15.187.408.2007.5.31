<TITLE> EU, US near deal on SWIFT data for security probes </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BRUSSELS, May 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States and the European Union are very close to a deal on how the US Treasury can consult international banking network SWIFT's data in its fight against terrorism, senior EU officials said on Thursday. EU and Belgian watchdogs said last year SWIFT broke privacy laws by allowing the US Treasury Department to secretly consult its records in terrorism probes after the Sept 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, a practice revealed by US media. US and European authorities have since sought to reach agreement on how the United States can consult Belgium-based SWIFT's data, amid concerns in Europe about US methods in the fight against terrorism and possible breaches of privacy. "It's almost done, we are in the final wording stage," one EU official told Reuters of the EU-US talks. EU officials hoped talks in the next few days could allow for a deal to be endorsed by EU Justice and Interior ministers at their next regular meeting on June 12-13. SWIFT, which handles global financial transfers, is a cooperative owned by roughly 7,800 financial institutions in more than 200 countries that use it. The Brussels-based company says it was bound to obey a US subpoena to transfer the data. The deal consists of a set of undertakings taken by the US Treasury Department on how it will use the data, how long it can keep it and with whom it can share it, EU officials said. SWIFT would also comply with US "safe harbour" rules, a voluntary scheme applied to transfer of personal data for companies who trade in the EU and the United States. US officials were not immediately available for comment. The EU and the United States are also in talks to replace temporary arrangements under which European airlines must pass on up to 34 data items on passengers, including addresses and credit card details, to be allowed to land at US airports. The interim deal expires at the end of July, after which the whole area would be in a legal limbo. "There we are further from an agreement ... it's more complicated," a senior EU official said. The United States want to keep the data longer and share it more freely among U.S. law enforcement agencies
