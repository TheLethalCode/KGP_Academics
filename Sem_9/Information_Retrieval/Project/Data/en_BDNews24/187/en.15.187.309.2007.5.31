 LONDON, May 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The dollar held near a seven-week high against the euro on Thursday as investors awaited US data that could further cool expectations for the Federal Reserve to trim interest rates later in the year. The market was relatively unfazed by robust comments from European Central Bank policymakers on euro zone growth and by a statement from China's deputy central bank governor that the euro's share in China's central bank reserves was set to grow. Revised US data on first-quarter growth at 1230 GMT is forecast to show a downward revision from the initial estimate, but the May non-farm payrolls report on Friday is expected to show a rise, while a snapshot of manufacturing activity, also due on Friday, is seen holding up well in May. The dollar has clawed its way back from a record low hit against the euro in April and a 26-year low against the pound as worries about the US economy's health have eased, reducing speculation of lower rates that would erode the greenback's yield appeal. "Earlier on in the week when we got a (euro) spike up to $1.3520 - there was a sense maybe that sentiment on the dollar was changing and this might be a good level to start buying euros again," Calyon senior currency strategist Daragh Maher said. "The dollar has now recovered that lost ground -- but it's not clear that we will extend to new territory on the downside for euro/dollar unlkess we get a moderate downward revision to GDP," he added. The euro was steady on the day at $1.3434 by 1019 GMT, after falling below $1.3410 on Wednesday to its weakest since mid-April. A break of $1.34 would probably trigger a deeper pull-back in the euro, traders said. The dollar was also steady against the yen at 121.65 yen, close to a 3-1/2-month high near 121.90 yen struck last week. The euro was unchanged against the yen at 163.38 yen, within one yen of recent record highs. France's consumer confidence index rose in May and producer prices were up in April, data showed on Thursday, shoring up expectations for a euro zone rate rise next week from the current 3.75 percent. However, in Germany, the May jobless total unexpectedly rose by 3,000 on a seasonally-adjusted basis, giving an unemployment rate of 9.2 percent, while a flash estimate of euro zone harmonisd consumer price inflation was well within expectations. European Central Bank Governing Council member Nout Wellink said that the euro zone's economic growth potential was rising as structural reforms were starting to pay off. Minutes from the Fed's May meeting released on Wednesday showed that policymakers felt inflation was their main worry and that growth should recover as the year drags on. "It (the minutes) leaves little doubt that monetary policy is on hold and indicates that the FOMC is likely to remain sidelined for a considerable period of time," Danske Bank said in a note to clients. The Fed has held rates steady for nearly a year at 5.25 percent, even as investors had expected the housing market troubles to lead to a rate cut, and with the European Central Bank and Bank of England seen raising rates further. Analysts said investors remained nervous about the outlook for equity markets and the potential for another rush out of risky assets that could prompt an unwinding of carry trades, in which low-yielding currencies such as the yen are used to fund purchases of higher-yielding currencies and assets. Japan's top financial diplomat Hiroshi Watanabe said on Thursday the size of the yen carry trade could be one tenth of $1.0 trillion, and that Japan had no intention to shift Japanese foreign exchange reserves into higher-yielding assets
