 PARIS, June 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World number two Maria Sharapova advanced to the third round of the French Open with a crushing 6-2 6-1 win over seasoned American Jill Craybas on Thursday. Sharapova, who had struggled to beat France's Emilie Loit in her first match here, needed just 64 minutes to brush aside her opponent. The 32-year-old Craybas is ranked a modest 73rd in the world but is remembered for stunning Serena Williams in the third round at Wimbledon two years ago. She was, however, never in contention against the 20-year-old Russian. The pair were tied 2-2 in the first set but Sharapova then won the next 10 games. After taking the first set with a service winner after 36 minutes, she opened up a 5-0 lead in the second set. Serving for the match, Sharapova was broken but then captured her opponent's serve, sealing victory with a forehand volley on the first match point. Sharapova prefers fast courts and has never gone beyond the quarter-finals on four previous visits to the French capital. The Russian, who held the number one spot earlier this year before suffering injury worries, goes on to meet Argentina's Gisela Dulko or Russia's Alla Kudryavtseva
