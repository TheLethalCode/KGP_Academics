<TITLE> Shoot on sight order in Rajasthan </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Narayan Bareth Jaipur, June 1 (BBC/bdnews24.com) -- A shoot-on-sight order is in force in two districts in India's Rajasthan state where tribal protesters have clashed with police for four days now. Thousands of soldiers are deployed across the state and in Bharatpur, the army has held a flag march. On Thursday, four more people were killed as the nomadic Gujjar tribals clashed with police in Sawai Madhopur. Altogether 18 people have been killed in the violence which has now spread to areas outside of Rajasthan. The Gujjars are demanding that they be included in an affirmative action quota for government jobs and other benefits. The trouble started on Tuesday in the state's Dausa district when police fired on Gujjar protesters who had blocked the main road connecting the city of Jaipur with the tourist destination of Agra where the Taj Mahal is located. UNREST SPREADING After day-long clashes between the protesters and police on Thursday in the districts of Sawai Madhopur and Bharatpur, authorities have issued a shoot-on-sight order. Gatherings of more than five people have been banned in Dausa where protesters are still refusing to cremate six of their dead killed in police firing. Trouble has now spilled out of Rajasthan into other states. In Faridabad town, on the outskirts of the Indian capital Delhi, police fired in the air to disperse a group of angry Gujjar protesters who were blocking traffic and burning effigies. Meanwhile, Rajasthan Governor Pratibha Patil has appealed to the people to remain calm and maintain peace. Over the last few days, properties and vehicles have been vandalised across the state and a strike call by protesters had shut several towns. Train services across the state have been disrupted, with protesters uprooting rail tracks in many places. Bus services to the state from the Indian capital, Delhi, have been cancelled. The first two round of talks between the state government, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and leaders of the Gujjars have failed to break the deadlock and the two sides are due to resume their dialogue again later on Friday. CATCH-22 Officials in the state capital, Jaipur, say the situation could become more complicated as a rival tribal group, the Meenas, has also taken to streets now. The Gujjars - a large and politically-influential nomadic tribe spread across north India - want to be categorised as an official tribe so that they may benefit from affirmative action quotas which will give them access to government jobs as well as places in state-supported schools and colleges. If the government accedes to their demand, it falls foul of the Meena tribe which is already in the official tribes list and at present corners most of the benefits meant for them. Meenas do not want to share the benefits with the Gujjars. The government is now in a catch-22 situation. If they accede to the Gujjars' demands, the Meenas threaten to launch protests. If they refuse the Gujjars' demands, the protesters threaten to escalate their action. The issue of affirmative action is a sensitive one in India, with many poor communities arguing that it is the only way millions of under-privileged people can benefit from India's economic boom. But those opposed to it say it is a cynical move by politicians to gain more votes from politically influential communities who make up a large percentage of the country's population.
