 Tangail, June 3 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Sunday fell sick apparently from sweltering heat when he was addressing the launch of a tree-plantation fair in Tangail. His press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim told bdnews24.com that he was out of danger. "Now he's doing well," Munaim told bdnews24.com at 12:30pm by phone. The district's deputy civil surgeon Feroz Khan told reporters that there was nothing to worry about. "He suffered from sweltering heat and dehydration," Khan said, adding he has been treated with IV fluid. He had liquid food, including soup, at Tangail General Hospital. Fakhruddin arrived in Tangail at 10:10am and began his address at 10:35am. But he collapsed on the podium at 11:41am when he was talking about the emergency government's programmes. Later he was taken to hospital. bdnews24.c
