The new policy has prioritised six itemsagro products and agro-processing, light engineering, shoe and leather products, pharmaceuticals, software and ICT and home textile products for exports. Pharmaceuticals are the new group added to the five priority areas of the previous policy. The latest policy has marked finished leather, frozen food, handicrafts, electrical goods, flower, jute goods, handloom, diamond and herbal medicine to add diversity to export products.
