 WASHINGTON, June 02 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US military launched a strike against a suspected al Qaeda target in northern Somalia on Friday, CNN reported. A US Navy destroyer targeted the suspect from off the coast of the African nation, the cable news network said, citing unidentified sources. There was no information about the results of the attack, it said. The target was a suspect in the 1998 bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed 240 people, CNN said. The destroyer's guns appeared to be targeting a single person, perhaps moving in a convoy, according to the report. A Pentagon spokesman would not comment on the details of the CNN report. "We recognize the importance of working closely with allies to seek out, identify, locate, capture, and if necessary, kill terrorist and those who would provide them safe haven," said spokesman Bryan Whitman. "The very nature of some of our operations, as well as the success of those operations is often predicated on our ability to work quietly with our partners and allies." The United States launched air strikes in Somalia in January targeting three top al Qaeda suspects but killing their allies instead, US officials have said. Those suspects also were wanted for the embassy bombings.
