 Dhaka, June 1 (bdnews24.com) -- Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina became "angry" with the government, as she did not get satisfactory answers from some advisers about the arrests of AL leaders, a senior leader said Friday. "The Awami League president yesterday (Thursday) talked to some advisers to know about the condition of the arrested leaders, but the advisers failed to answer her questions. It made her angry," AL leader Shahjahan Khan, a former lawmaker, told reporters after a meeting with Hasina at her Sudha Sadan home. She (Hasina) is worried about the condition of party general secretary Abdul Jalil and presidium member Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, who have been remanded after arrest. AL presidium member Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury and Barrister Rokanuddin Mahmud also went to Sudha Sadan to see the AL chief Friday. Joint forces arrested Jalil on May 28 and Selim on May 29. Jalil was taken into a four-day remand on May 29. Jalil stands accused of making inflammatory comments that threatened to unsettle the country, according to details in a case filed with Motijheel Police Station. Jalil's lawyer Mahbubey Alam told the court that the AL leader was seriously ill with cardiac and kidney ailments. He also urged the court to reject the remand prayer. But the court turned down the appeal. The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka sent Selim into three-day remand in police custody on May 30. Selim faces allegations of spinning off huge wealth through the abuse of power as minister when the Awami League was in office. Hasina had earlier condemned the arrests of leaders of her party and demanded their release. bdnews
