 Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com) -- The interim cabinet has cancelled the viva results of the 27th BCS exams, the government said in a statement Wednesday. According to the statement released by the Press Information Department, the cabinet made the move to restore trust of people in the Public Service Commission and establish transparency in the wake of several news reports questioning the BCS exams. Broader allegations of question leaks, politicisation, bribery and nepotism marred the transparency of the exams. The government will ask the PSC to arrange fresh oral exams for the candidates who had already passed written tests. The decision was made at a cabinet meeting, chaired by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed. The PSC posted an advertisement on June 28, 2005 for 27th BCS exams, seeking applications for 1,776 vacant posts. As many as 1,36,105 people filed applications and 1,18,339 took the exams. Of them, over 26,000 examinees passed written tests. The authorities called 16,418 candidates for viva. The PSC declared 3,567 candidates successful and asked the authorities to appoint them. Medical tests of many candidates were held, but were postponed later in line with a recommendation of the establishment ministry. bdnews24.c
