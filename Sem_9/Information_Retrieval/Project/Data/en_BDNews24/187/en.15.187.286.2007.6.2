 WASHINGTON, June 02 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Trade Representative Susan Schwab heads to Russia late next week for expected talks on Moscow's bid to join the World Trade Organization and other issues, a US trade official said on Friday. Schwab is scheduled to participate in a panel on June 10 at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. While in Russia, she will likely meet with Russian Trade Minister German Gref to discuss what additional steps Moscow needs to take to join the WTO, a spokesman for the US Trade Representative's office said. The United States and Russia struck a bilateral deal late last year covering agricultural, manufacturing and other market access provisions of Moscow's entry into the WTO. However, Russia still must reach a final entry agreement with all 150 members of the WTO. In those negotiations, Washington is pressing Moscow to take stronger steps to stop widespread piracy of American movies, music and software. Schwab will head to Russia after accompanying President George W. Bush to the annual Group of Eight summit meeting next week in Heilgendamm, Germany. Trade ministers from the eight leading countries are expected to discuss how to push world trade talks to a successful conclusions this year. A continued ban on US beef imports also may be an issue on the bilateral agenda. Karen Batra, a spokeswoman for the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, a trade group, said the US industry is anxious to see a resumption of beef exports to Russia, which have been on hold since mad cow disease surfaced in the United States in 2003. "What would be nice would be if they would open the market, which is what they've promised to do," Batra said. The industry has been waiting for months for Russian officials to arrive to inspect US beef plants -- a move they say is long overdue under last year's bilateral agreement. The US case for renewed trade, Batra said, may well be strengthened by a new "controlled risk" safety rating for US beef from the World Organization for Animal Health. "So (Schwab) is probably going with that in her back pocket as well," Batra said.
