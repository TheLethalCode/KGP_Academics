<TITLE> World No Tobacco Day Thursday </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com) - World No Tobacco Day is to be observed Thursday in Bangladesh as well as across the world. The theme of this year's World No Tobacco Day is a 'smoke-free environment worldwide'. Over 20 NGOs, including Bangladesh Anti-Tobacco Alliance (BATA), Bangladesh Cancer Foundation and Bangladesh Cancer Society, observe the day by bringing out rallies, holding awareness building meetings and various cultural programmes. The health ministry has also chalked out elaborate programmes to observe the day with state-sponsored media campaigns on awareness, discussions and rallies. In Bangladesh, an estimated half a million peoplemost unaware of the impacts of tobacco usedie from tobacco-related ailments. The majority of people sick from tobacco use suffer from lung cancer, followed by oral and windpipe cancers in Bangladesh. Despite approval of the anti-tobacco law passed in parliament, its implementation largely remains ineffective. Although there are provisions of fines and punishments in the law not only for smoking in public places but also for the display or sale of tobacco products in locations other than specified areas, monitoring is still weak. The World Health Organisation says the annual celebration focuses on the dangers of using tobacco, the business practices of tobacco companies. This year's theme promotes 100 percent smoke-free environments as the only effective means to protect people everywhere from exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke. Tobacco is the second major cause of death in the world. It is well known that half the people who smoke regularly todayabout 650 million peoplewill eventually be killed by tobacco. Equally alarming is the fact that hundreds of thousands of people who have never smoked die each year from diseases caused by breathing second-hand tobacco smoke. bd
