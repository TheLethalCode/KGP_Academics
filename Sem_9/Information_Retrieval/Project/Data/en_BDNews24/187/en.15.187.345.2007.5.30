<TITLE> Sierra Leone to give Britain's Blair a hero's welcome </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 FREETOWN, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sierra Leone's traditional rulers will crown British Prime Minister Tony Blair a "paramount chief" on Wednesday in recognition of Britain's help in ending the West African country's civil war. Blair, due to stand down as prime minister next month, will be given the honorary title for sending British soldiers to Sierra Leone in May 2000, as rebels notorious for hacking off civilians' limbs advanced on the capital, Freetown. On a farewell tour to Africa, Blair is flying to Sierra Leone from Libya, where he met its leader Muammar Gaddafi and witnessed the announcement of major energy and defence deals. Representatives of Sierra Leone's 149 paramount chiefs, local traditional rulers in the former British colony, will name Blair one of their own at a ceremony in the township of Mahera. "We have nothing, no money to give him but it is a way of recognising him as a chief of our nation," said Ibrahim Kamara, a local official in the village of tin-roofed shacks, spread among mango and coconut trees across the river from Freetown. "All the paramount chiefs together with the head of state agreed on the gesture. It's the highest traditional honour," he said, as schoolchildren practised a welcome dance behind him. While Blair's critics say history will judge him harshly for Britain's involvement in Iraq, Sierra Leone is popularly seen as a high point of his foreign policy: his government cites it as a model of what can be done to save a failing state. Britain sent around 900 troops to Sierra Leone after the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels, who carved their initials into the backs of child soldiers and injected them with drugs, flouted a peace deal and took UN peacekeepers hostage. After checking the rebel advance the shock troops pulled out, but British military experts stayed to train an army with a fearsome reputation for coup-plotting and disorganisation. "Tony Blair is a hero. He took a real risk. If the intervention had failed it could have been his downfall," said journalist Augustus Kamara, who named his son -- born a year after the British action -- Tony Blair Kamara. Yet five years after the war ended, Sierra Leone remains one of the poorest countries in the world. Much of Freetown, a sprawl of rust-coloured shacks spread over tropical rolling hills, is without mains electricity or piped water. Britain's military intervention may have restored security but despite aid of around 40 million pounds ($79 million) a year, many of the underlying causes of the war, such as rampant corruption and widespread unemployment, remain to be resolved. "Sierra Leone is potentially a very wealthy country ... but it is not building up its natural wealth and we have a half-done job to thank for it," said Major General Jonathon Riley, a former Commander of the British forces in West Africa. "The real danger is that, having fixed security and not the other essentials, we have simply created the conditions for the next military coup," he said in a speech last year. Some Sierra Leoneans regret Blair will only visit the area around Mahera and Lungi international airport during his lightning trip, across the broad mouth of the river Rokel from Freetown itself. But the location has been carefully chosen. Blair's father once taught in Freetown and was a friend of Mahera's late paramount chief, Baisheko Shaka Bailay Komkanda II, whom the prime minister met on his last visit. "Tony Blair promised he would be back before retiring," said Ibrahim Kamara. "He is here to accomplish that mission." bd
