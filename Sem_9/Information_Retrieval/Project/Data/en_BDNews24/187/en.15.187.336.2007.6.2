<TITLE> China Vice Premier Huang Ju dies: Xinhua </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIJING, June 02 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese Vice Premier Huang Ju, a protege of former leader Jiang Zemin, died early on Saturday after a long illness, the official Xinhua news agency reported. Xinhua did not specify his illness, but Huang was known to have had cancer. His death months before the 17th Party Congress, a five-yearly meeting that makes key personnel changes, could intensify jockeying between political factions associated with Jiang and those loyal to President Hu Jintao. Huang, 68, had been ranked sixth on the Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee, the all-powerful group of nine that rules China, where he had been responsible for the key economic and financial portfolios. But his death is unlikely to impact economic policy, with another vice premier, Wu Yi, having already taken over his roles. The Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets are closed on Saturday. An obituary issued by the central government called Huang a "long-tested and faithful Communist fighter and an outstanding leader of the Party and the state". An engineer by training, Huang emerged from Jiang's Shanghai powerbase, becoming mayor of the financial capital in 1991 and Communist Party boss there in 1994. Analysts say that the way in which Huang's replacement is handled -- or whether he is replaced at all before the Party Congress -- could be a barometer of Jiang's influence. Hu is still consolidating power more than four years after taking the top job, and the Congress is likely to identify a younger generation of leaders to take the helm after he and Premier Wen Jiabao retire in the next decade. A native of the eastern coastal province of Zhejiang, Huang was educated at Beijing's elite Tsinghua University, and spent more than four decades as a Party member. He was promoted in 2002 to the Politburo Standing Committee. His death comes two days before June 4, the anniversary of the 1989 military crackdown on pro-democracy protesters at Tiananmen Square, prompting speculation that the announcement was timed to distract attention from the sensitive date.
