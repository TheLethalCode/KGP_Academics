 SKOPJE, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Macedonia's largest ethnic Albanian party, created from a 2001 guerrilla army, ended a six-month boycott of parliament on Wednesday, winning praise from the West. The Democratic Union for Integration (DUI), now in opposition, reached agreement with Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski on Tuesday on a list of bills that would require a majority of Albanian votes in parliament to become law, the party's main demand over weeks of talks. The deal represents "an important step forward in the country's NATO and EU integration process", the European Union and United States ambassadors in Skopje said in a joint statement late on Tuesday, when the DUI's return to parliament appeared assured. The DUI is the main political bloc to emerge from an ethnic Albanian guerrilla army that fought government forces in 2001 for greater rights for the 25 percent Albanian minority. It found itself in opposition last year for the first time since the conflict when Gruevski formed a coalition with the DUI's smaller rivals following a general election in July. DUI leader Ali Ahmeti accused Gruevski of ignoring the will of Albanians, who had voted in greater numbers for the DUI, and pulled his deputies from parliament at the turn of the year. The European Union, which made the former Yugoslav republic a candidate for membership in late 2005, urged dialogue between the two sides, warning that the impasse was slowing reform and jeopardising the country's bid to begin accession talks. "It's a good step," a Western diplomat said of the DUI's return to parliament. "Finally both sides realised how important it is that state institutions function normally, especially if they hope for a future in NATO and the EU." Western diplomacy in 2001 ended months of fighting between Ahmeti's guerrillas and government forces, which had threatened to plunge the country of 2 million people into civil war. The so-called Ohrid Accord offered Albanians greater rights, but has been years in coming to fruition and tensions remain
