<TITLE> European powers with no more margin for error </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BERLIN, May 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Italy, Spain and Portugal have the chance to get back on course for Euro 2008 on Saturday, but England's situation could get a whole lot worse as they sit out the first of two qualifying dates in five days. Before players in the top leagues can think about their holidays, or in Spain's case the end of the title race, there are two rounds to get through, and little margin for error. World champions Italy, in fourth place in Group B, two points behind leaders Ukraine, Scotland and France, have Champions League final hero Filippo Inzaghi back for what should be an easy game away to the Faroe Islands on Saturday. With Scotland not in action until Wednesday and France and Ukraine playing each other at the Stade de France, a convincing win may even be enough to take Italy top. For France, the heavyweight clash with Ukraine will be a big test of resources, given that Patrick Vieira, Thierry Henry and Willy Sagnol are all injured. Coach Raymond Domenech has called in more newcomers including 21-year-old Stade Rennes striker Jimmy Briand. PAST MISTAKES Spain, who lie third in Group F, four points behind leaders Northern Ireland and three shy of Sweden, can also atone for earlier mistakes when they visit Latvia on Saturday. Northern Ireland do not have a game on either night, while Sweden face a potential banana skin away to fourth-placed Denmark on Saturday. The main task for Spain coach Luis Aragones will be to get his players focused on the task in hand, given that there are still two rounds of matches to go in a knife-edge title race. "It will be hard for people to change the chip," said recalled Valencia winger Joaquin. "We're on the closing straight in the league but we have to make sure we change the focus." Portugal are in an even tighter battle. They lie second in Group A, five points behind Poland, who have played a game more, and level with Serbia and Finland. While Finland host Serbia on Saturday, Portugal can look forward to an away game against Belgium, a team they beat 4-0 at home in March. Serbia have been hit by an injury to striker Nikola Zigic that will keep him out of the Finland game. NIGHT OFF Whatever happens, it is likely to be a frustrating night for England, who are struggling in fourth place in Group E. Croatia, the leaders on 13 points, are away to Estonia, while second-placed Israel (11) are away to Macedonia and third-placed Russia (11) are at home to Andorra. England have a friendly against Brazil on Friday but they are not in competitive action until Wednesday's game away to Estonia, by which time they could be five points off the lead. Germany lead Group D on goal difference from the Czech Republic and Ireland, with a game in hand on the former and two games in hand on the latter. Germany will almost certainly hold on to top spot when they play San Marino on Saturday. Second-placed Czech Republic face a tougher game away to Wales in Cardiff, where Ryan Giggs will be playing his last international. The Czechs could do with him going quietly if they are to get some breathing space over the Irish, who are not in action until September
