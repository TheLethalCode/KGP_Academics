 ISLAMABAD, June 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's military top brass reaffirmed its support for President Pervez Musharraf on Friday amid a deepening political crisis triggered by his move to dismiss the country's top judge. The suspension of Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry has turned into the most serious challenge so far to Musharraf's authority, sparking a campaign by lawyers and opposition parties for the restoration of full democracy in the country. The scale of the brewing crisis drew a strongly worded statement of support from the country's top generals, not only for Musharraf's presidency, but also for his dual role as Chief of Army Staff (COAS). "The participants reiterated support for the pivotal role of the President and COAS in the ongoing reform process," read the statement issued after Musharraf chaired a meeting of Corps Commanders at General Headquarters in Rawalpindi. The statement also alluded to the mounting dissent, describing it as a "malicious campaign against institutions of the state, launched by vested interests and opportunists". "Any attempt by a small minority to obstruct the aspirations of (the) vast majority would only derail the nation from its path of progress and prosperity," the military said in a statement, adding that the army was committed to helping Musharraf build a progressive, moderate Islamic state. Musharraf, who seized power in a bloodless military coup in 1999, will seek a second five-year term as president later this year. He aims to be re-elected by the current assemblies before they are dissolved in November ahead of general elections. Political analysts suspect he also wants to remain army chief, although he should give up the dual role by the end of this year. Analysts believe Musharraf's main motive for seeking to replace the chief justice stemmed from doubts whether Chaudhry would support him in the event of constitutional challenges to his re-election strategy. There is a degree of disarray in the political coalition that forms another prop for Musharraf, as some politicians have shrunk from supporting the president in his confrontation with the chief justice, fearing a voter backlash. American backing is also seen as crucial for Musharraf, and US officials have voiced continued support for him in the past month. "We are not pulling back from that relationship in any way," a US diplomat, who was not authorised to speak for the record, said last week. The United States has viewed the general as an key ally in fighting terrorism in a Muslim nation where anti-American sentiment is rife. Pakistan's support is also viewed as critical for Western efforts to quell a Taliban insurgency and stabilise Afghanist
