<TEXT>
 MADRID, June 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - David Beckham will not join his Real Madrid team mates to play an exhibition game against a combined Israeli and Palestinian side because of a dispute with the club, match organisers said on Friday. The Shimon Peres Centre for Peace, who have organised a number high-profile sports events to promote peaceful relations in the region, said in a statement that Beckham would not make the trip to Israel "because of differences with the management." The statement added that the rest of the team would come as planned for the game which will take place two days after the end of the Spanish season on June 19. Beckham, who is set to play for England against Brazil later on Friday, announced in January that he would be leaving Real Madrid at the end of the season after agreeing to sign a five-year deal for MLS side Los Angeles Galaxy worth $250 million. He was initially left out of the Madrid squad in the wake of his announcement but has been in impressive form since his return and has played an important part in helping Real overhaul Barcelona at the top of the table to challenge for their first league title since 2003. Although he is under contract to Real until June 30, Beckham will leave Madrid shortly after their final league match against Real Mallorca in order to take a holiday with his family before moving to Los Angeles
