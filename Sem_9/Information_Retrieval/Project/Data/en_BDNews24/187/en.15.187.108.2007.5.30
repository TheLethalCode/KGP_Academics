<TITLE> UK's Stansted expansion inquiry starts </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A public inquiry into expansion proposals for London's Stansted Airport begins on Wednesday when operator BAA will seek to overturn a local authority rejection of an increase in flights. Last November Uttlesford District Council rejected BAA's planning application to remove a cap of 25 million passengers using the airport's existing runway each year, because of environmental concerns. BAA, owned by Spain's Ferrovial, wants to increase the number of passengers using the airport, a major hub for low-cost airline Ryanair, to 35 million by 2014 and to increase the number of flights to 264,000 a year. A government-appointed planning inspector will hear BAA's appeal against Uttlesford Council's decision, which was based on concerns about noise pollution, air quality and climate change. The public inquiry is due to run until October 5. "No-one should be in any doubt that we remain very confident of the case we have made and that this will be fully recognised at the public inquiry," Terry Morgan, managing director BAA Stansted, said last year. Campaign groups, led by the Stop Stansted Expansion, say the proposals would have a devastating effect on the local environment as well as contributing to global warming. "Aviation is already the fastest growing source of carbon dioxide emissions in the UK," said Mary Edwards, Friends of the Earth's East of England Regional Campaigner. BAA also wants to build a second runway at the busy airport in Essex, northeast of London, but says that proposal is unrelated to the existing expansion plans. The government has backed moves for the second runway at the airport by 2013 as part of a 30-year strategy to cope with soaring demand for air travel, particularly in England's crowded south-east. BAA is due to submit a separate planning application this year
