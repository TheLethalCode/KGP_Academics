<TITLE> S Africa pay claims may prompt rate rise: economists </TITLE>

 JOHANNESBURG, June 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Above-inflation pay demands may push South Africa's Reserve Bank into raising interest rates, economists said on Friday, warning that resulting higher inflation could cancel out the benefit of wage increases. Disillusioned by widening wage gaps and miffed by possible double-digit increments for MPs and senior government officials, civil servants launched a nationwide strike on Friday. They are demanding a 12 percent pay hike, while some unions in the mining industry are bringing a 20 percent wage demand to the negotiating table, saying they are warranted as mining houses cash in on booming commodity prices. With data showing this week that CPIX inflation breached the upper end of the central bank's 3-6 target band in April at 6.3 percent -- the first time in nearly four years -- economists said the prospect of higher wages could be the final factor triggering an interest rate hike. A Reuters poll published on Thursday showed 13 of 17 economists already expect the central bank to raise the repo rate 50 basis points to 9.5 percent on June 7 after a sharp increase in inflation in April and faster than expected credit growth data. "We are sitting with a situation where we have to accept that wage increases -- whatever they will be -- are going to be far above inflation this year, and that will definitely put pressure on inflation," said Mike Schussler, economist at T-Sec. Producer price inflation also exceeded forecasts at 11.1 percent, according to data on Thursday -- a bad omen for consumer prices in the next few months. This comes at a time when South Africa's inflation outlook is grim on the back of higher food and fuel prices. Reserve Bank Governor Tito Mboweni said last week the bank was watching for the impact of the wage demands on inflation. Schussler said it takes about six months for wage increases to work their way down to consumers, so it may be a while before their impact is felt. But that is small comfort to the Reserve Bank, whose inflation target has already been breached. Any above-inflation settlements will be unwelcome. Nominal wage settlements averaged 6.5 percent last year, compared to 6.3 percent in 2005, according to Andrew Levy Employment Publications. If workers get their way in this round of talks, these numbers will shoot up, analysts said. "That number will definitely rise if they settle on what the workers are asking for, and unfortunately somebody's got to pay for it," said Chris Hart, senior strategist at ABSA Capital. He said the costs will be passed to consumers, and high wage settlements could even lead to higher taxes. "If you get a rise above inflation, you are effectively getting something for nothing, and unless productivity improves, the money has to come from somewhere," Hart said. "The irony is that the above-inflation wage demands could force the central bank to hike interest rates, destroying the value of the money through higher prices.
