<TITLE> Sony joins HD Radio push with car, home radios </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sony Corp on Tuesday said it would soon sell HD Digital Radios, making the Japanese electronics maker one of the largest manufacturers to back the broadcast radio industry's fledgling technology. Sony said it would start shipping in July a tabletop radio and a model for cars, kicking off what it calls a long-term commitment to offering a range of HD Radio-enabled products over the next several years. HD Radio lets traditional radio stations broadcast multiple new digital channels. The service is free, but consumers must buy a compatible radio. US radio operators are working to promote HD Radio at a time when consumers are already faced with many digital music options, such as Apple Inc's iPod, other MP3 players and satellite radio. The industry has pledged to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on marketing through the HD Digital Radio Alliance. Sony said its table top XDR-S3HD radio would be available in July for about $200, and its XT-100HD car tuner will be available that month for about $100.
