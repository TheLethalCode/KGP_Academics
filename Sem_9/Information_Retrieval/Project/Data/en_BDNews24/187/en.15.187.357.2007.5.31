<TEXT>
 RIGA, May 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Latvia's parliament chose a leading surgeon criticised for taking undeclared cash presents from patients as the country's new president on Thursday. Valdis Zatlers, 52, who had the backing of the four-party government coalition but is a political novice, will replace Vaira Vike-Freiberga. His supporters say under-the-counter payments from patients are common in Latvia and do not mean he was corrupt. But critics have said he is not suitable to lead the country, a European Union and NATO member since 2004. "God bless Latvia," Zatlers told parliament after winning 58 votes of 98 ballots cast in the 100-seat house, beating ex-constitutional court judge Aivars Endzins. Zatlers is expected to preserve the pro-Western stance of the small Baltic nation, which quit the former Soviet Union in 1991. He has criticised the government for not doing enough to dampen inflation, which has soared amid strong economic growth. The president in Latvia has limited but important legislative powers and is a key voice for the country abroad. At a news conference after the vote he was bombarded with questions about the appropriateness of Latvia having a leader who had taken such payments, without declaring them to the authorities. "This question has been discussed thoroughly over the last 10 days," he said. He said he planned to go to the tax authorities on Monday to sort out the issue and that corruption had to be combated at all levels. Latvia has the EU's highest economic growth rate of around 11 percent, but started from a low base, and Latvians are among its poorest people. The government has said he is the best candidate for the job and said he had been honest by admitting he took cash payments from patients. But some Latvian commentators have said the government backed Zatlers as it wanted a president sympathetic to it after clashing with Vike-Freiberga over controversial new laws that would have increased government influence over the security services. Her veto of the laws led to the calling of a referendum seen as a vote of confidence in the government. The bills were later scrapped. Vike-Freiberga was eastern Europe's first female president, a respected figure and once a dark horse candidate to succeed the last UN chief, Kofi Annan
