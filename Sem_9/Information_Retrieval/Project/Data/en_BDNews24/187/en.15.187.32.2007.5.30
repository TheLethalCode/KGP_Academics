 Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh has ratified the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism Wednesday to strengthen the legal framework to combat terrorism. With the approval of the convention, Bangladesh has signed a total of 12 anti-terrorism conventions of the United Nations out of 13. Bangladesh's accession into the convention has been approved at the council of advisers meeting with chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed in the chair Wednesday. The convention was the first counter-terrorism convention adopted by the UN General Assembly since the terrorist attacks of Sept 11, 2001 in the United States. The treaty opened for signature on Sept 14, 2005 and entered into force 30 days after it was signed and ratified by at least 22 states. "The adoption of the convention will help us to investigate alleged terrorist offences, arrest, prosecute, or extradite offenders through information sharing among the signatories," a senior home ministry official said. The Nuclear Terrorism Convention would also address, to a limited extent, the treatment of detainees, he said. The council of advisers' meeting also approved an amendment to The Pesticides Ordinance, 1971, and ratified a multilateral agreement on International Paddy Research Institute. bd
