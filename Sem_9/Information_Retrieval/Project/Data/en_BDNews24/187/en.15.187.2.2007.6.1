 SRINAGAR, India, June 01 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Separatist militants set off a bomb in Indian Kashmir's main city on Friday, wounding at least one soldier in an army bus, an official said. "They targeted an army convoy. Initial reports say one soldier was wounded and the bus was damaged," Lieutenant Colonel AK Mathur told Reuters. The blast occurred in the heart of Srinagar, the summer capital of Kashmir. Witnesses said the number of wounded was higher. Violence has flared up in Kashmir in recent weeks after the end of the winter, allowing easier movement of militants across the high mountain passes that divide Indian Kashmir and the Pakistani controlled zone of the troubled region.
