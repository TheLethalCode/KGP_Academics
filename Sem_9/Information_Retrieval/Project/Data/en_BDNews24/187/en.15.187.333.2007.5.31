 Dhaka, May 31 (bdnews24.com)  Controversial businessman Giasuddin Al Mamun rebuked his lawyers Thursday for failing to get newspaper editors and some reporters to stand as witnesses. Mamun told the court Tuesday that three newspapers had reported the joint forces detained him on Jan. 31 and kept him in a secret place for two months. He referred to the reports to argue that he had failed to respond to an Anticorruption Commission notice asking him to submit his wealth statements as he was in covert detention. After a day's recess, Mamun's lawyers told Judge Ashraf Hossain of the Special Judge's Court-6 that they could not bring the journalists to stand as witnesses. The court set June 4 for hearing arguments in the case filed by the Anticorruption Commission. Mamun's lawyers had appealed to the court to allow the editors and reporters to testify. The court agreed to hear them Thursday if the editors and reporters were ready to stand as witnesses. "Why did you fail to bring the editors and reporters? You could also have gathered evidence from those who were arrested along with me. Why did you fail to bring them?" Mamun thundered in the courtroom. Mamun's lawyers then asked the court to accept photocopies of the newspaper reports. The prosecution lawyers argued that no photocopy of newspapers was acceptable as evidence in the court. However, if any journalist appeared before the court, his deposition could be accepted, they said. The court agreed. Public prosecutors Syed Golam Fattah and Mosharraf Hossain Kajal represented the state. Assistants of Barrister Fakhrul Islam, Mamun's lawyer, stood in the court in his absence. Mamun was brought to the court from Narsingdi jail at 1:50pm. bdnews24
