 Dhaka, June 2 (bdnews24.com)  The interim cabinet Saturday approved a proposal to sign memorandum of understanding between the Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution and the Bureau of Indian Standards. A regular meeting of the Council of Advisers chaired by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed gave the go-ahead. It also approved the draft of an agreement on capital investment, development and preservation with Saudi Arabia, chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim told bdnews24.com Saturday evening. The Saudi government has already okayed the proposal. Munaim said Bangladesh and India would sign a memorandum that would allow the BSTI to test and certify Bangladeshi goods to be exported to India. Local exporters now require BIS certificates to sell products on the Indian marketa non-tariff barrier that local exporters have been demanding to be lifted. Senior officials of the BSTI and the BIS at a meeting in Dhaka recently finalised a list of products for export. Munaim said the council approved a ratification proposal on establishing the SAARC Food Bank, the deal on which was signed prior to the 14th SAARC summit. The cabinet also approved a proposal to appoint an expert of the International Organisation for Migration to introduce Machine Readable Passport (MRP) and Machine Readable Visa (MRV). The previous BNP-led government decided to introduce MRP and MRV, and floated an international tender. But the project fell through on allegations of gross irregularities by former state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar. bdnews24.c
