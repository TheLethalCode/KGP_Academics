Six people were jailed for between five and 10 years and fined for their role in India's worst bomb attacks, bringing to 51 the total number of those sentenced so far, including policemen and customs officials. The 51 have been punished with varying jail terms and fines for crimes including helping in the transport and concealment of arms and ammunition as well as conspiracy. The anti-terrorism court last year found 100 people guilty in the attacks that police blame on India's most wanted man, Dawood Ibrahim.
