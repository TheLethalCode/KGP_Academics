 PATNA, India, June 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An 8-year-old boy was being questioned in eastern India after he was accused of murdering his infant sister and two other babies over the past year, police said on Friday. The boy was detained on Tuesday after a woman accused him of strangling to death her 6-month-old daughter in Musahari village in Bihar state, police said. "It's really horrible," said Amit Lodha, the superintendent of police of Begusari district where Musahari is located. "It appears the boy is mentally deranged," he said, adding that the boy had confessed to police to the latest murder. Lodha said police were also investigating the deaths of the boy's 6-month-old sister and a cousin about the same age. The boy has been placed in a remand home in the nearby town of Munger. Under Indian law, a child cannot be sentenced to death or sent to prison, but he can be detained at a children's home until he turns 18. bdn
