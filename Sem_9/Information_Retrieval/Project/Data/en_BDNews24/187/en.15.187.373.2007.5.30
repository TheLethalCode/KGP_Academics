The Naples "garbage crisis" has dominated news in Italy for weeks as local and national authorities have tried to end a stalemate over mountains of trash rotting on the streets because of a lack of adequate landfill sites. Italian authorities are looking into temporary solutions, such as re-opening closed landfills and sending garbage to other areas.
