 MILAN, June 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Although several domestic seasons have already finished, Europe's top players will have to work their weary legs again later on Saturday when a host of Euro 2008 qualifiers take place. World champions Italy will be keen to make up for a shaky start in qualifying by scoring a hatful in the Faroe Islands while Group B rivals France and Ukraine face each other in Paris knowing the winners will take top spot outright. Captain Patrick Vieira and striker Thierry Henry are out injured for France but so is Ukraine's Andriy Shevchenko. Italy are without several key players including defender Alessandro Nesta, who chose to get married instead of play. Third-placed Spain need three points in Latvia to boost their Group F campaign as leaders Northern Ireland miss two rounds of matches and Sweden, in second, visit neighbours Denmark. The top three in Group A all have tricky away tests with leaders Poland playing in Azerbaijan, Portugal visiting Belgium and Serbia facing Finland. Germany coach Joachim Loew has banned talk of a record-breaking win against San Marino in Nuremberg. Loew's side, who lead Group D on goal difference from the Czech Republic and Ireland, battered San Marino 13-0 away in September but he would rather they also beat Slovakia on Wednesday than aiming to surpass the 16-0 they managed against Russia in 1912. Ireland do not play but the Czechs visit Wales in Ryan Giggs's last game before international retirement. Croatia, Israel and Russia could all put distance between themselves and stuttering England in Group E with Steve McClaren's side not playing in Estonia until Wednesday. Leaders Croatia visit Estonia first while Israel travel to improving Macedonia and Russia host Andorra. Group C pacesetters Turkey and Greece are also in action against Bosnia and Hungary respectively. Romania play in Slovenia and Bulgaria take on Belarus with the eastern European neighbours hoping to take advantage of a day off for Group G leaders the Netherlands
