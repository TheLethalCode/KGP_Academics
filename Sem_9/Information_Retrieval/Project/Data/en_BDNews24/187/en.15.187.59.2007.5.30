<TEXT>
 POTSDAM, Germany, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British officials are working with Iraqi authorities to find out how five Britons were abducted from a government building and to secure their swift release, Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett said on Wednesday. She declined to give any further details of Tuesday's kidnapping, other than to confirm that the five Britons were taken in an incident at the Finance Ministry in Baghdad. "It is not sensible at this stage to speculate about what might have happened," Beckett said on arrival at a meeting of Group of Eight foreign ministers in the eastern Germany city of Potsdam. "We are working closely with the Iraqi authorities to establish the facts and doing all we can to secure their swift and safe release." She said it was a very distressing time for all concerned and officials were offering assistance to the next of kin. The kidnapping took place in a daylight raid by dozens of gunmen despite a crackdown by US and Iraqi troops in Baghdad. A spokesman for the British foreign office said it was unclear who was responsible for the attack although Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari has said the Shia Mehdi Army militia was probably behind it. The British government's top-level emergency committee, known as COBRA, will convene again on Wednesday to discuss the kidnapping
