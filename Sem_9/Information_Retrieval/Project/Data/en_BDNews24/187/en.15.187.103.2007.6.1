 PARIS, June 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks gained ground for a second consecutive session on Friday, as a broad rally supported by upbeat analyst notes helped the market touch a new 6-1/2 year high before the release of US jobs data. Better-than-expected quarterly results from US computer maker Dell helped boost Europe's tech shares, with German chip maker Infineon up 1.7 percent. SAP gained 3 percent, also supported by market talk that US software firm and archrival Oracle had acquired a stake in the German firm. SAP declined to comment. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.35 percent to 1,1617.01. The benchmark index, up 9 percent so far this year, reached 1,619.51 earlier in the session, a level not seen since late 2000. The market was bracing for US non-farm payroll figures for May, due at 1230 GMT, expected to show that 130,000 jobs were added, compared with a 88,000 increase in April. "The numbers should be relatively good," said Jean-Luc Buchalet, strategist at Factset, in Paris. "The job market is still quite robust despite the tepid figures in April, and there is so much liquidity out there that the outlook for stocks remains positive," he said. Looking at Asia, global stock markets are relatively immune against a potential selloff in Chinese stocks, Templeton Asset Management's Mark Mobius said in a research note, but risks could be heightened if the impact of a market crash spills over to the Chinese economy. "There is a risk if the effects of a bursting of the A-share market were to spill over into the Chinese economy, especially as China has become an engine for growth in the rest of Asia -- and, indeed, for much of the world," he wrote. Around Europe, the FTSE 100 gained 0.1 percent, the DAX added 0.8 percent, while France's CAC 40 rose 0.4 percent. French carmaker Renault advanced 5.5 percent as investors hoped that the launch of new models will help the struggling automaker reverse slumping sales figures. France's car sales figures for the month of May released on Friday showed a 9.6-percent drop in Renault sales, but the weak data followed an even sharper drop in April. Renault's chief executive reaffirmed the company's 2007 operating margin goal during a meeting with investors, a spokeswoman said. Elsewhere in Europe, utilities Iberdrola and Union Fenosa again led the Spanish market, with gains of 5 and 3 percent respectively. Traders said the stocks were gaining on the back of continued takeover speculation but there was no fresh news to justify Friday's rises. Lafarge added 1.7 percent after UBS raised its rating and price target, citing strong quarterly results. Cable & Wireless climbed 1.9 percent after ABN AMRO lifted its price target on the telecommunications company. ASML rose 2.2 percent as analysts cited the company's potential to improve order levels and its cash return to shareholders, with Kempen & Co raising ASML's rating to "buy" from "hold". In a broader view, a combination of continued earnings growth and a modest re-rating should push global equity markets higher, but gains are likely to be lower than in recent years and volatility could be higher, Henderson Global Investors said. "Prospective returns to equities are reasonably good while corporate earnings grow and global economic growth is close to its trend rate," Henderson director of economics and strategy Tony Dolphin said
