 LONDON, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - GCap Media posted a 35 percent fall in full-year pretax profit to 14.4 million pounds ($28.6 million) on Wednesday due to a tough advertising market and fierce competition, driving its shares down 6 percent. But the group, Britain's biggest commercial radio broadcaster, said it had stabilised audience figures, seen less volatility in the ad market and was confident it had the correct strategy. "The market remains difficult to predict, but we have seen an improving trend in advertising revenue performance, and we outperformed the market in the last quarter of the financial year," GCap Chief Executive Ralph Bernard said. GCap said it had been affected by the difficult ad market, a reduction in the number of ads it plays on its Capital 95.8 radio station and a loss in revenue from the sale of two Century stations. It said it had identified a further 5.5 million pounds of operational cost savings that would be made over the next year but said this would be matched by a net investment of 5.6 million pounds. Numis analyst Lorna Tilbian said she was surprised with an investment programme of this nature and scale given GCap's "margins are half (or less) than those of its peers." GCap's shares were down 6 percent at 243 pence at 0730 GMT. The group, which owns the Capital, Classic and Xfm stations, said underlying revenue was down 9 percent year-on-year at 200.1 million pounds for the 12 months to end-March and that it would cut its total dividend to 4.6 pence from 9.25 pence a year ago. Excluding the results of the Century stations, which were sold in October 2006, revenue was down 7 percent. It said total revenues for April and May 2007 would be down 2 percent and 1 percent respectively year-on-year on a like-for-like basis. Bridgewell analyst Patrick Yau said GCap had suffered as Britain's biggest commercial radio group but said he would upgrade his recommendation from Overweight to Neutral as he thought the company's strategy was correct. GCap reduced the number of adverts it shows on its once London favourite Capital 95.8 station to win back listeners, but in the first quarter of the year data showed it had remained behind Emap's Magic 105.4 and Chrysalis's Heart 106.2 in popularity. Fru Hazlitt, GCap's managing director in London, said she thought the decision had given extra value to advertisers and had since launched other stations such as theJazz with the same system. Bernard said the group was in the best position it had been in since it formed from the merger in May 2005 of GWR Group plc and Capital Radio plc and said it would focus on investing in its successful brands and competing with the BBC for listeners. He said the group would look to raise its dividend as cover and earnings improve
