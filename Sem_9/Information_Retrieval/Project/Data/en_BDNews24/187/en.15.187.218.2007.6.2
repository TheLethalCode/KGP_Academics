<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 2 (bdnews24.com) Car dealers, politicians and members of the civil society Saturday asked for an end to the discriminatory policy in the import of reconditioned cars to ensure adequate transportation for people. Speakers pressed the demand at a round table titled "Reconditioned Vehicles: Import Policy and Reality," organised jointly by Channel i and Saptahik 2000 at the Jatiya Press Club Saturday. The participants asked the government to allow import of six-to-eight-year-old reconditioned vehicles, vehicles having over 1600 CC engines, vehicles more than 10 years old for the commercial transportation sector as well as a reduction of taxes on import of station wagons and smaller (up to 1300 CC) vehicles. They also demanded import of construction and agricultural equipment and vehicles facilitating public transportation. Md S Islam Nannu, the organising secretary of Bangladesh Business Forum in Japan, said Bangladesh had enacted a law prohibiting import of vehicles more than four years old. But Ireland and the Arab Emirates allowed import of vehicles up to 22 years old, Saudi Arabia 20 years, Thailand 18 years, Australia 14 years, England 12 years, and Russia and New Zealand up to 9-year-old Japanese vehicles. He said if import of six-to-eight-year-old vehicles were be permitted, Bangladeshi buyers would be able to purchase those vehicles for Tk 4.5 to Tk 5.5 lakh each instead of in the current range of Tk 8 lakh. President of Bangladesh Reconditioned Vehicles Importers and Dealers Association (BARVIDA) Abdul Haque said the age limit for reconditioned vehicles should not be four years. He said in case of cars and microbuses the limit could be extended to six to eight years and for big buses 10 years. Haque said if a six-year-old reconditioned vehicle could be imported, a buyer here could get it for Tk 5 lakh only. "Our main demand is an end to discrimination in case of import of reconditioned vehicles and a sustainable import policy for reconditioned vehicles." The four-party alliance government in 2002-03 banned import of reconditioned vehicles on the pretext of reducing environmental pollution and allowed import of only new vehicles. It eventually withdrew the ban realising that the Japanese reconditioned vehicles were relatively cheaper and durable. But a condition was imposed that no vehicle older than four years and over 1600 CC could be imported. As a result, the sales of reconditioned cars fell drastically. Prof Atiur Rahman of Dhaka University's Department of Development Studies said as the import of vehicles older than four years was banned, farmers were not being able to use station wagons to transport their commodities. He said as Dhaka was a disaster-prone area, industrial equipment would have to be imported. He said there should be a policy on how many vehicles could be imported and suggested the government give more attention to the road sector. Prof Khandkaker Md Muniruzzzaman of BUET urban and regional planning department said as the population was dense and space sparse, less costly and small vehicles should be imported. Politician Rashed Khan Menon said cars were changing moral values. He said reform has been done everywhere except in the economy. He stressed rural commodity transportation and transportation for the masses. Former army chief lt gen (retd) M Mahbubur Rahman said, "I would have been happy if this discussion was on the export of new cars." Prof AWM Mahbub of Dhaka University's Department of Geography and Environment, Dainik Bhorer Kagoj editor Shyamol Dutta, member secretary of Bangladesh Paribesh Andolon Sirajul Islam, and convener of Paribesh Banchao Andolon Abu Naser Khan as well as several car traders spoke. bdnews24.
