<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 2 (bdnews24.com)- Dr Kamal Hossain has said he will help and support a platform for a healthy brand of politics and believes politicians facing corruption charges should call time on their career. At the same time, political parties should conduct reforms or purge themselves of people thriving on black money and muscle, the veteran politician and jurist told bdnews24.com in an exclusive interview Saturday noon. On the formation of the new party, Dr Kamal said that he would extend all out cooperation to form a platform for a healthy brand of politics. The Gana Forum president said it was the time to take into political fold those who wanted to do healthy politics, the time to form a platform so that all could go forward together. On whether people had started expressing their no-confidence to those in government over the past 18 years, Dr Kamal said, "People are not bringing no-confidence against political parties. The parties against whom allegations of corruption have been raised should conduct reforms and purges. "When a disease afflicts society, political parties cannot remain free of it. No party can say corruption has not made inroads into it. "I have a small party. I will also have to see whether my party is showing symptoms of the disease. "It is natural that the symptoms of the disease will be found on a larger scale. And possibilities are there that the symptoms would be found the most in the immediate past ruling party or alliance. On whether any other new party was going to be launched, he said, "People want healthy politics instead of diseased politics. But the parties that are already in the field need to play a role for returning to healthy politics. "If the big parties return to the stream of healthy politics through reform, small parties like ours will welcome it. "At the same time, if any new party wants to join the fray, I will also welcome it. When Prof Yunus announced his joining politics, I welcomed him. Dr Kamal, one of the framers of the constitution, said those who became victim of unhealthy politics, who are facing allegations of corruption may step aside accepting the mistake. "In politics, if anybody makes a mistake, he steps down from politics. There are several such instances in different countries." "The citizens of the country will also have to be conscious about it. People have voted the same person time and again falling victim to ill politics. "When an election is controlled by black money people become helpless. People now want respite from such situation," he said. "If we work in unity, good work can be done. Ahead of the election, alliances can be made and what other options are there, can be seen later. "Now, I will call upon all to work unitedly for healthy politics. And I am interested about a platform for working in a coordinated way." Asked how far the work of the platform has advanced, Dr Kamal said, "I am getting response. People from different regions of the country are spontaneously telling me about their interest to see healthy politics." On whether those taking initiative for a platform were getting any kind of cooperation from the government, he said, "They can say that. We are getting help from you-the mass media. "If we get your help we don't need any other assistance. We want people's assistance. And we want the help of those who want a healthy political trend." He said terrorism, corruption, politicisation and militancy on one hand and a consensus among the common people for a meaningful change on the other had grown for for the last few years. People wanted to bring about the change through a fair election in a democratic environment. Different political parties, professional organisations and civil society also wanted election of honest and efficient people through proper election. "When it became clear that defying all sorts of protests the January 22 elections were being imposed, the incidents of January 11 reflecting the aspirations of the people took place, leading to the cancellation of the unwanted election. "People welcomed it. After that a process started. A non-party caretaker government was formed and they in a few days reformed the Election Commission, and the independent Anticorruption Commission started work." Dr Kamal said the government must provide legal help to the Election Commission and the ACC needs to take steps to do its job properly. He said some steps were essential for an election to be free from the influence of black money. Action must be taken against big corruption. "Action against big corruption must be taken by the deadline set for holding the election. The government will have to help the ACC with money and workforce for the purpose." Dr Kamal said from the steps the government has taken, he believes it is doing exactly that. bdnews
