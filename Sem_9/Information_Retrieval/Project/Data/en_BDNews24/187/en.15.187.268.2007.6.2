 BAGHDAD, June 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Three Iraqi children were killed when a US tank fired at insurgents planting roadside bombs on Friday near the Sunni town of Falluja, west of Baghdad, the US military said. The statement said one insurgent was wounded and three men fled the scene. It also quoted local people as saying the three dead children were 7, 9 and 11 years old. It said the incident was under investigation. "Three children were killed and one insurgent was wounded when a Coalition Force tank fired on three men emplacing an improvised explosive device (IED) outside Falluja," it said. "Due to dust and debris, the tank crew's view of the blast was obscured immediately after they fired. It is not clear at this time if there were secondary explosions at either site from IED material," it said. Statements by US-led forces admitting causing civilian casualties are rare but many Iraqis insist such incidents are more common.
