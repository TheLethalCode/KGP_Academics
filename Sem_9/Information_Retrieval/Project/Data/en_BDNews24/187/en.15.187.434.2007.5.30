 MUMBAI, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thousands of Indian jewellers shut their stores on Wednesday and held a noisy protest in the financial capital of Mumbai against a rise in burglaries and attacks on gold merchants. More than 30 break-ins have been reported over the past three months by jewellery stores in the western state of Maharashtra, and jewellery worth millions of dollars stolen. Mumbai is the capital of Maharashtra. Thieves have also killed three jewellers in the last two months when they tried to stop them from looting their shops. In some cases, thefts have involved burqa-clad customers whose identity could not be established even on closed-circuit television. "Security, where is security, we would like to know from police," said Haresh Kewalramani, a director at the Bombay Bullion Association. "Shop owners do business risking their lives, thinking when am I going to be attacked," he said. About 20,000 jewellery store owners and workers from across Maharashtra gathered in Mumbai, carrying placards and banners that urged police to provide security. They also carried pictures of a jeweller bludgeoned to death recently. "Victim, victim! Where is the police?" read one of the posters. The day-long shutdown affected bullion trade marginally, traders said. bd
