<TEXT>
 LONDON, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff is to undergo a third operation on his troublesome left ankle, the England and Wales Cricket Board said on Wednesday. Flintoff, who missed the first two tests of England's current four-test series against West Indies because of the problem, will have investigative surgery over the weekend. "Andrew Flintoff has undergone rigorous fitness testing over the past two days, most recently 30 minutes of net bowling on Tuesday, but has reacted to the testing with further discomfort in his left ankle," ECB chief medical officer Nick Peirce said in a statement. "Despite intense conservative treatment and rehabilitation with England and Lancashire's medical teams, Andrew's ankle has continued to cause him discomfort when bowling at full capacity. As a consequence he will undergo an exploratory arthroscopy on his left ankle over the weekend.
