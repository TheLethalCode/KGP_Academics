<TEXT>
 TOKYO, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Nikkei average fell 0.5 percent on Wednesday after China tripled its tax on stock trading, raising concern the Shanghai market was headed for a sharp downturn. Shares of Chugai Pharmaceutical Co Ltd tumbled more than 7 percent after a brokerage cut its rating on the stock, citing a lower-than-expected price for a cancer drug. Electronic components makers such as Kyocera Corp fell after data showed industrial output unexpectedly dropped in April, a possible sign that demand for Japanese exports is slowing. China's benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell more than 7 percent after the government lifted its tax on stock trading, its strongest effort yet to cool equity speculation. "The decline today is 100 percent influenced by China," said Soichiro Monji, chief strategist at the equity management department of Daiwa SB Investments. "In theory it shouldn't matter if Chinese stocks plunge, but markets are at high levels and investors are very aware of the downside risk." A sell-off in equities would hurt Chinese consumer demand, which has been a key component of that country's strong economic growth, Monji said. The Nikkei finished down 84.30 points at 17,588.26, while the broader TOPIX index slipped 0.2 percent to 1,733.75. The Tokyo exchange had its most active day of trade in a week, with 2 billion shares changing hands on the exchange's first section. Declining shares beat advancers, 898 to 706. Chugai slid 7.1 percent to 2,620 yen. Brokerage Nikko Citigroup cuts its rating on the drug maker to "2" from "1", citing a lower-than-expected price for Avastin, a drug for colorectal cancer. Japan's health ministry announced preliminary pricing for the drug at 50,291 yen for 100 milligrams. That was 28 percent lower than expected and a "negative surprise", Nikko Citigroup analyst Hidemaru Yamaguchi said in a note to clients. Chugai said after the market closed it expected Avastin sales of around 7 billion yen by the end of next March. Shares of Kyocera declined 1.8 percent to 11,620 yen, becoming the biggest contributor to the Nikkei's fall. Government data showed on Wednesday that industrial output fell 0.1 percent in April from March, well below the forecast for a 0.5 percent increase. "Clearly, production is weak at the moment," said Hideyuki Suzuki, investment information manager at SBI Securities. "However, there is a chance that this is just a short-term thing. Usually production is weak at this time of year. So the data for July and August is likely to be more closely watched." Concerns about China would likely remain in the Japanese market, at least over the short term, Daiwa SB's Monji said. "At the moment everyone is nervous about China," he said. "While there may be no impact on economic fundamentals, worldwide concern about the Chinese market will continue." Shares of Risa Partners Inc finished up 1.7 percent at 358,000 yen, climbing into positive territory after the president of the real estate investment firm told Reuters it will likely buy an asset management company or financial services company. The stock had fallen as low as 344,000 yen, down 2.3 percent, in early afternoon trade. Shares of Fast Retailing Co Ltd rose 2.8 percent to 9,260 yen after brokerage Goldman Sachs lifted its rating on the clothing retailer to "neutral" from "sell" and removed the stock from its Japan "sell" list. The outlook for the company's earnings has improved, Goldman said in a note to clients on Wednesday, due to increased product recognition and market share expansion
