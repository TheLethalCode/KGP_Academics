<TEXT>
 LONDON, May 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England players are determined to keep under-fire manager Steve McClaren in his job by beating Estonia in their Euro 2008 qualifier next week, captain John Terry said on Thursday. England face an uphill struggle to qualify for the finals after taking only 11 points from six games in Group E and McClaren knows his position could be under threat if they fail to pick up three points in Tallinn on Wednesday. McClaren still has painful memories of the boos he received from England fans during their last game, a laboured 3-0 win over Andorra in Barcelona in March. Terry said the players had every faith in McClaren and had no doubts he was the right man to lead them to the finals in Austria and Switzerland. "We are fully behind the manager and we are going to do our best to keep him in his job," Terry said. "I don't sense that (pressure on McClaren). He has been very relaxed. Training has been good and sharp and what the manager demands, he gets. "We are thinking positively. We need to go there and get a win. It is as simple as that." Before the Estonia game, England play Brazil in a friendly on Friday
