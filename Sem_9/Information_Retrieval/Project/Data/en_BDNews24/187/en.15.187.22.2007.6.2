 Dhaka, June 02 (bdnews24.com) - The World Bank (WB) Saturday said that it was ready to help Bangladesh recover stolen assets. "Stolen assets must be recovered. The WB stands ready to provide assistance in this regard," Praful C Patel, WB vice president, South Asia, told journalists at a briefing at Sonargaon Hotel. Patel said that Bangladeshi assets had either been stolen or smuggled outside the country for the last several years. Corruption generated those assets, he said. "If Bangladesh seeks assistance, we'll provide that," Patel pointed out. Independent think-tank, Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) Saturday disclosed that the present caretaker government had so far recovered some Tk 431 crore in stolen-money. "This will have a positive impact on the revenue collections," CPD executive director Debapriya Bhattacharya said, "We hope more money will be recovered." The WB Dhaka office organised the briefing to inform the media on Patel's three-day visit that concluded Saturday. Patel held meetings with chief adviser, finance adviser and some other government high officials during his visit. WB country director Xian Zhu and Jonathan Dunn of International Monetary Fund, Dhaka office were present at the briefing. Patel congratulated the Fakhruddin Ahmed-led caretaker government for its efforts at curbing corruption and improving governance and steps taken to improve the political and security situation. "Focusing on credible prosecutions of several big fishes instead of widening the net, will send the right signals and enhance the credibility of the anti-corruption commission," he said. He said: "It is also important to design checks and balances to minimise abuses of power in future." Patel admitted increase in prices of some food items, but said that it had happened mainly because of hike in international market prices. "Global factors are causing inflation in Bangladesh," he added. "We must watch this inflationary pressure very closely and understand the different causes of current inflation situation to help institute appropriate policy measures," the WB vice president said. Jonathan of the IMF said that supply side constraints were also pushing the inflation, which needed to be addressed. Patel hailed the caretaker government for its commitment to carry out major economic policy reforms, especially in addressing poor revenue collections, large energy sector losses, trade liberalisation and outstanding state-owned enterprise liabi
