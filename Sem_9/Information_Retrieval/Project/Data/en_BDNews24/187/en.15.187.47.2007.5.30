<TITLE> Christie's bullish on Asia amid flat global growth </TITLE>

 HONG KONG, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Christie's, the world's largest auction house, expects no let-up in demand for Chinese art this year, with Asian sales set to rise up to 20 percent, amid relatively flat global revenues, its chief executive says. "We believe that we can deliver 15 to 20 percent sales growth per annum from our business here in Asia, and we believe that's a relatively modest target, a sensible one," Chief Executive Officer Edward Dolman told Reuters. Hong Kong is considered the world's third-largest global auction centre, after New York and London, given red-hot demand for Chinese artwork, particularly contemporary Chinese paintings. Christie's ongoing spring sales in Hong Kong broke several auction records for individual Chinese artists like Yue Minjun, Zeng Fanzhi, Li Keran and Zao Wou-ki -- with some $35.6 million of Asian contemporary art sold in a marathon session last Sunday. "(The session) was phenomenal in terms of exceeding our expectations and it didn't actually finish till 00:50 in the morning ... because bidding was incredible, you couldn't stop it," Dolman said. "The percentage of mainland Chinese buying has just gone from strength to strength," he said of the country's growing ranks of newly minted millionaires buying art for profit and pleasure, and who make up 20 percent of Christie's buyers in Hong Kong. "I don't think art has been as central in people's thinking as it is now," he said. "There's a global shift toward modern and contemporary art ... in particular the work of living artists." But Dolman said Christie's, a private company owned by French billionaire Francois Pinault, would have difficulty surpassing its 2006 record global sales total of $4.67 billion -- that was given a shot in the arm by a blockbuster sale of five paintings by Austrian artist Gustav Klimt worth $327 million. "Our headline sales might actually fall because they were so strong last year," said Dolman. "We believe now that we will at least match our performance in 2006. We're driven ... by major collections that come on to the market, it's not a reliable source." But on Asia and China, Dolman remains bullish, expecting the region to contribute between 20 and 40 percent to its global sales tally in the next five years, up from 10 percent today. "We suspect it's going to outgrow other parts of the group," he said. Despite the hype surrounding Chinese art, recent demand has not been consistently strong across all categories. For Christie's Chinese ceramics and Works of Arts sale on Tuesday, only 63 percent of lots were sold, compared with 95 percent for contemporary and 20th century Chinese paintings. "In the Chinese works of art category, which is a much more mature market, we don't see those same selling rates. It is more selective and people are looking for great and rare and unusual objects," Dolman said "And by definition, these don't appear at auction very often.
