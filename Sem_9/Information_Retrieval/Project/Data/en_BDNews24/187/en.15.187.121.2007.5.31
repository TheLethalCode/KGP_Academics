 LONDON, May 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police have condemned a burglar who stole the engagement ring from the finger of a 103-year-old woman as a "coward". The thief snatched the ring worn by Florence Heyes for the past 57 years after entering her flat in Manchester early on Saturday pretending to be a police officer. He asked for money and jewellery before taking the ring. A spokeswoman for Manchester Police said: "This is one of the oldest victims of crime we have had to deal with. That a criminal could target a woman of this age is despicable." Detective Sergeant Gary Smith added: "Even the criminal community cannot think this sort of behaviour is acceptable. To target such a vulnerable member of the community in her own home is cowardly and completely unacceptable.
