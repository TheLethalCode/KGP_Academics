<TITLE> Minister's suicide evokes Japan's shady politics </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The suicide of a scandal-plagued cabinet minister this week has revived memories of the shady politics that long plagued Japan's ruling party until maverick Junichiro Koizumi changed the rules of the game five years ago. Any impression that incumbent Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is a throwback to his Liberal Democratic Party's darker past would damage the ruling coalition's chances in a key July election, the 52-year-old leader's first big test at the polls, analysts say. The popular Koizumi was widely credited in his term as premier with modernising the LDP by weakening its factions, bolstering the authority of the cabinet and party headquarters, reducing wasteful public works spending in rural districts and appealing to the mostly urban "floating" voters who stress image and policies over party ties. "I don't think people will vote for the old LDP, and Abe is looking more and more like the old LDP," said Steven Reed, a political science professor at Chuo University in Tokyo. Agriculture Minister Toshikatsu Matsuoka committed suicide on Monday, hours before he was to face questioning in parliament. Matsuoka, 62, had been linked to several scandals, including one in which he reported huge spending on utilities for a rent-free office and another in which he received donations from businessmen involved in bid-rigging scam. His suicide coincided with a slump in Abe's approval ratings due largely to the government's mishandling of millions of pension payment records that could short-change retirees. Scandals have plagued the LDP during much of its five decades in power and the party was losing support before Koizumi took over with his message of economic and political reform. Despite the air of deja vu, the days are gone when the LDP could count on wooing rural backers with pork-barrel spending, ignore the cities, and leave decisions to secretive party dons. Many of the changes so skilfully exploited by Koizumi were rooted in tight government finances, which turned off the public works taps, and the 1994 introduction of single-seat election districts that did away with battles among candidates from the same party and forced an appeal to broader groups of voters. "It's hard to go back to the old LDP," said Gerry Curtis, a political science professor at Columbia University in New York. "The structural changes are real. The factions can't be revived. The fund-raising system has become more transparent," Curtis added. "They've cut public works spending ... They don't have that kind of pork-barrel spending budget any more." Abe's real problem, analysts said, was an apparent inability to adapt to the changing political landscape, provide strong leadership and appeal to voters with the flair shown by Koizumi. "It's not the old LDP, but what you can say is it's not the Koizumi LDP, either," Curtis said. "It doesn't look like the LDP has its finger on the public pulse." The LDP elected the well-dressed, soft-spoken Abe as party chief in September in hopes his popularity -- based largely on his tough talk towards nearby North Korea -- would help win the July election for parliament's upper house. Abe quickly won kudos for improving ties with China. But he also came under fire for appointing cronies to his cabinet and for letting anti-reform rebels back into the party. He has also been dogged by a series of gaffes and missteps by appointees, including a political funds scandal that forced one cabinet minister to resign just three months after taking office. "The rules of the game have changed, but he doesn't have the personnel to play it," said Martin Schulz, a senior economist at Fujitsu Research Institute. Analysts said it was tough to predict whether Abe could regain credibility with voters ahead of the upper house election. But they said he would need to focus on issues closer to voters' hearts -- such as pensions and health care -- rather than pet projects such as revising the pacifist constitution and boosting Japan's global security role to succeed in doing so. A loss in the upper house polls would not automatically force Abe to resign but would likely spark calls for him to do so. "The impression that he is not on top of things is very damaging," Curtis said. "He has to stop talking about the constitution and patriotism and focus on what the public cares about.
