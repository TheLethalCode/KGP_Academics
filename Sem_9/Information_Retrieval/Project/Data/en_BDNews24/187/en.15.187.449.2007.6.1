 BELGRADE, June 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serbia was hoping on Friday for good news from the European Union on its frozen pre-membership talks, after arresting a fugitive army general wanted for war crimes and sending him to the Hague tribunal. Official sources in Belgrade said there were indications that the move has persuaded EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn that it is now time to lift the freeze on talks with Belgrade imposed a year ago over non-cooperation with The Hague. General Zdravko Tolimir, a Bosnian Serb Army aide to top fugitive Ratko Mladic, the wartime commander, was already on his way to the tribunal aboard a NATO military flight from Sarajevo. He is accused of the genocidal murder of Bosnian Muslims. "The current government wants to prove to the West they are really trying to arrest Mladic, while the previous cabinet did not have such enthusiasm, and at one point even ignored the Hague," said military analyst Ljubodrag Stojadinovic. He and other analysts believe the net may now be closing around Mladic himself, following formation of the new coalition government on May 15. "His entire staff is now in the Hague," said Stojadinovic. "His logistical support has been reduced to a few people, his sponsors are exhausted. But he still gets vital information from the centre of the security services and that is how he still manages to evade justice". Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, who retains the top post in the new coalition, says the EU should never have frozen talks over Mladic, but is likely to welcome a decision by Rehn to re-start the suspended process. The EU is eager not to alienate Serbia further at a critical time when the fate of its breakaway province of Kosovo is about to be decided. Kosovo's 90 percent Albanian majority demands independence and has the West's support. Tolimir is alleged to have helped Mladic plan and execute the massacre of 8,000 Bosnian Muslims at Srebrenica in 1995. He was the first war crimes fugitive to be handed over to the tribunal in more than a year. His arrest leaves five Serb suspects still on the run. "This arrest is a message to all of them," said Rasim Ljajic, head of Serbia's council of cooperation with The Hague. "Tolimir was the brains of Mladic's support network but he was unable to escape the law." Stojadinovic said he did not think Tolimir would betray Mladic, and might not even possess key information. The significance of the arrest was rather in that it signified a new sincerity by Belgrade about catching the top fugitive. Kostunica has flirted with nationalism. Now, his stronger partner in power is the Democratic Party of pro-Western President Boris Tadic, and together the new government must pull off a delicate balancing act between two rival visions. The stability of this government depended on whether Mladic will be arrested, Stojadinovic added, whereas in Kostunica's previous cabinet -- backed by the Socialists of late strongman Slobodan Milosevic -- it depended on him not being arrested
