 BELGRADE, June 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Bosnian Serb general accused of complicity in the murder of thousands in the 1992-95 Bosnia war was on his way to the Hague tribunal on Friday, a gesture that may improve Serbia's chances of joining the European Union. Zdravko Tolimir's arrest, on genocide charges, was the first in more than a year. Belgrade sent a dozen war crimes fugitives to The Hague in 2005, but the handovers dried up with six top suspects still at large, including former Bosnian Serb Army commander Ratko Mladic. "We are hoping to see Tolimir arrive at the detention centre in the course of today," said a spokeswoman for UN chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte. There were few details about the capture of the 58-year-old former general -- alleged to have helped Mladic plan and execute the massacre of 8,000 Bosnian Muslims at Srebrenica in 1995 -- but it is unlikely to have been some lucky accident. Analysts suggested it could be the first step to the capture of Mladic, on the run since 2001 when he lost the protection of toppled Serb strongman Slobodan Milosevic. "The whole action was the result of significant pressure from the outside," said Natasa Kandic, head of Serbia's Humanitarian Law Centre. "Nevertheless, it's a step forward, and we can expect to see the arrests of other fugitives." The arrest was also a confusing signal from Serbia, whose recent tilt towards Russia -- in hopes that it will prevent the independence of breakaway Kosovo province -- has led a prominent Western think-tank to suggest Belgrade is "turning away from Europe". The fate of Kosovo, to be decided by the UN Security Council, is now the most contentious issue in the Balkans. The West supports the independence demand of its 90 percent ethnic Albanian majority but Moscow, backing Belgrade, seems prepared to delay that indefinitely. EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, who holds the key to Serbia's hopes of EU membership, welcomed Tolimir's arrest as "an important step towards bringing to justice all remaining fugitives". Del Ponte's spokeswoman, while welcoming the news of Tolimir's arrest, stressed that Serbia was still under an obligation to arrest and transfer the remaining suspects. "There are still five remaining fugitives, most of whom we believe to be in reach of Serbia," she said. Del Ponte, who prompted the EU last May to freeze talks with Serbia on closer ties, is due to visit Serbia next week to make a fresh assessment. Fears that the biggest Balkan country might slide back into the anti-Western isolation of the 1990s over the possible loss of Kosovo have already convinced some EU states it would be best to resume the talks anyway, to show Serbia the door is still open. For them, Tolimir's arrest may be a sufficient gesture. During the Bosnia war, he was one of seven assistant commanders who answered directly to Mladic, and he is thought to have helped the commander avoid arrest in the years since 2001. Officials said the former general was ill, maybe with cancer. He was arrested on the border between Serbia and Bosnia's Serb Republic. There were rumors that he was simply dumped over the border, to reduce the political fallout among Serbia's many ultranationalists
