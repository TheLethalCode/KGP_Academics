 ABUJA, May 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The outgoing Nigerian House of Representatives has passed a fiscal responsibility bill designed to protect prudent macro-economic reforms carried out by the previous government, legislators said on Thursday. Investors see the bill, which has also been passed by the Senate, as an important step towards entrenching policies that have improved the public finances of Africa's top oil exporter in the past four years. The bill was passed on Wednesday during the last legislative session by the House after members were softened with a separate bill last week that improved their remuneration package. A newly elected National Assembly will take office next week after President Umaru Yar'Adua was sworn in on Tuesday. Legislators said there was a legal grey area over whether Yar'Adua could sign the bill into law, because it was passed by the legislature of a previous government. Investors welcomed the prospect of the new law. "There has been a lot of negative bias on news coming out of Nigeria, especially the elections, but this shows that there's a slow, positive grind towards better government in Nigeria even if there are hiccups along the way," said Stephen Bailey-Smith, emerging markets strategist at Standard Bank. The bill seeks to institutionalise better budgeting at federal level. It also seeks to improve control over savings from oil revenues above the price set in the budget, by giving the central bank powers to invest the savings in consultation with the federal, state and local tiers of government. It gives powers to the president, with National Assembly approval, to set borrowing limits for all three tiers of government and restricts borrowing to financing capital expenditure and development projects on concessionary terms. The original bill was delayed for years and then largely rewritten in the legislative process because many members feared it would undermine the autonomy of state governments to manage their own finances. Nigeria rid itself in 2005-2006 of $30 billion in debt to Paris Club sovereign lenders in a debt relief deal that involved using oil savings to pay $12 billion in exchange for an $18 billion write-off. The debt relief was one of the major achievements of an economic reform team brought in by former president Olusegun Obasanjo in 2003. Their policies have also enabled Nigeria to accumulate more than $40 billion in foreign reserves. But the fiscal responsibility bill faced opposition in the National Assembly for political reasons, said Farouk Lawan, chairman of the House committee on budget. He said many members had been reluctant to pass it because they were angry with Obasanjo over what they saw as interference during April's elections, in which many of them lost their seats. International observers said the polls were not credible. In the end, the pill was sweetened with a separate appropriation bill, passed last week, in which 12 billion naira ($94 million) was set aside to improve the remuneration package of National Assembly members. "We used it to encourage them to pass the fiscal responsibility bill," said Lawan
