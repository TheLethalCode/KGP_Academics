 Dhaka, May 31 (bdnews24.com)Joint forces Wednesday arrested Habiganj Sadar upazila nirbahi officer AKM Lutfar Rahman, a few hours after he was made an 'officer on special duty' on charges of bribery. Habiganj Sadar police sub-inspector Shah Muhammad Mubashshir told bdnews24.com that joint forces had caught the UNO in the act of taking Tk 12,000 in 'bribe' from Sona Miah, member of Ward No. 3 in Gopaya union. Sona Miah brought the UNO the money realised from the sale of two tonnes of rice allocated for the reconstruction of the walls of government quarters, he said. Lutfar was interrogated by the joint forces and handed over to the deputy commissioner who convened a probe committee with additional deputy commissioner Jyoti Lal Kuri as its head, Mubashshir said. The UNO then left for home. Officers of the Sadar police station arrested him again at his home at 11:00pm Wednesday. Habiganj deputy commissioner Ataur Rahman said: "What the UNO did was an irregular act. Departmental action will be taken against him." Lutfar Rahman said: "Sona Miah came to me just to deposit the rice sale proceeds. I don't know anything else." Sona Miah said, "I gave him the money as I was told by the UNO. I deposited another Tk 20,000 to him Tuesday." Mubashshir said a bribery case was filed with Habiganj Sadar Police Station. Nasir Uddin, Anticorruption Commission's deputy director for Sylhet division, said the ACC would investigate the case. "We have written to the head office for deploying an investigation officer for the purpose." Mubashshir further said the arrested UNO was sent to court Thursday. bdnews24
