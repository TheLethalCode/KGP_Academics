<TEXT>
 LONDON, May 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The FTSE 100 of Britain's leading shares was 0.5 percent higher on Thursday, led by mining stocks and after US Federal Reserve minutes had helped US and Asian markets recover from Wednesday's weakness sparked by a Chinese share trading tax move. The Nasdaq index notched its highest finish in more than six years after the minutes of the Fed's latest monetary policy meeting showed officials thought risks to US economic growth had diminished "slightly", boosting optimism about the outlook for corporate profits. At 1024 GMT the FTSE 100 was up 31.3 points at 6,633.4, as a survey showed that British consumer confidence shot up to a two year-high in May as people became more optimistic about their own finances and the economy in general despite interest rates going up. "It did seem that as soon as the Fed minutes came out it (American markets) did seem to rally, so I think we can put it down to that," said Mark Priest, a trader at Tradindex. "China are a bit concerned, they seem to want to slow everything down a bit, the boom-bust fear is creeping in, in their minds." In sectors, mining shares supported, accounting for over 13 index points on the upside as firm metal prices and consolidation hopes attracted investors, traders said. Xstrata added 3.5 percent, Anglo American tacked on 3.6 percent and Kazakhmys climbed 2.5 percent. BHP Billiton, which named insider Marius Kloppers as its new chief executive, replacing Chip Goodyear, gained 1.3 percent. "The FTSE seems to be quite mining sensitive," Priest added. "If you strip out the mining sector it's only up 10 points or so, which on the back of what we saw on the Dow yesterday, the FTSE is a little bit more wary of these massive rises and falls." Real estate companies also featured amongst gainers, as traders said optimism was feeding through from a deal in Australia in which Morgan Stanley's real estate unit agreed to buy Australia's Investa Properties for A$4.7 billion (US$3.9 billion) and after US real estate investment trust Archstone-Smith agreed to be acquired in a deal valued at $13.5 billion. Land Securities was up 2.3 percent, Hammerson gained 1.2 percent and British Land added 2 percent. But Johnson Matthey topped the FTSE 100 leaderboard, climbing 4.2 percent after Citigroup upgraded the British platinum specialist to "buy" from "hold" and lifted its price target to 1,800 pence from 1,400 pence. European stocks overall hit fresh 6-1/2-year highs, underlining a recovery from Wednesday's weakness. On the downside, GlaxoSmithKline, which has been hit by safety concerns over its diabetes drug Avandia, fell 0.7 percent. It rose late in the previous session after the company said it was too early for doctors or Wall Street to write off the medicine, but resumed its downbeat trend again on Thursday as JP Morgan cut its price target for the stock. The drug maker's new cervical cancer vaccine Cervarix will get a standard 10-month review from the US Food and Drug Administration, rather than a rapid one that could have been completed in just six months. In other stocks, Kingfisher, the owner of home improvements retailer B&Q, saw its sales exceed expectations in the first quarter. Group Chief Executive Gerry Murphy said the outlook for international markets was generally positive but he remained cautious on Britain with demand for bigger home improvement projects likely to be dented by this year's interest rate hikes. Kingfisher was down 3.4 percent. "The difficulty is judging what proportion of the profit-sales recovery is attributable to management and what is thanks to the luck of the good weather," said Keith Bowman, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers. "(Kingfisher) figures are supportive, although rising interest rates across Europe continue to cast a major shadow over the outlook." "The concern is that the first quarter proves to be as good as it gets, with the result that market consensus opinion remains no more than a hold." Further on the downside, British Airways dipped 0.5 percent after Citigroup cut its price target on the stock, to 580 pence from 600 pence and kept its "buy" rating. Vodafone lost 0.9 percent on profit-taking, traders said. Meanwhile US preliminary first-quarter US gross domestic product data is due at 1230 GMT
