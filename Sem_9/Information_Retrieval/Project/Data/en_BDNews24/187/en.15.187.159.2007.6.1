 Biplab Rahman Senior correspondent, bdnews24.com Dhaka, June 1 (bdnews24.com)The Election Commission is seriously contemplating using steel ballot boxes after considering the available options. The EC will finalise its decision after consulting the political parties though. The Election Commissioner Muhammad Sahul Hossain told bdnews24.com Friday, "If we can make the political parties understand that free and fair elections will be possible using steel ballot boxes, I don't think they should object to it." He said the Commission has, on principle, decided using the steel ballot boxes after considering the comparative costs and rationale for all the available optionstraditionally used opaque steel boxes, transparent boxes proposed by the political and the army proposed semi-transparent boxes parties. Sahul pointed out, "Since we have about 1,50,000 steel ballot boxes ready at the thana election offices countrywide and another 11,000 steel boxes made by the army machine and tools factory for the cancelled January 22 polls, using them in the next elections will be just sensible, or all the money spent for the boxes so far will go down the drains which we couldn't afford." "We inspected the army innovated semi-transparent box at Gazipur Machine Tools Factory. Transforming the steel boxes into semi-transparent ones will cost about Tk 30 crore. The fully transparent boxes will have to be manufactured abroad which will cost much more and take much longer time too." Transparent ballot boxes are made only in Canada and Denmark. The Canadian High Commission had intimated in October they'd take two years and five million dollars to make required quantities of transparent boxes for holding a 95 million voters polls, EC officials said. Three years back, the EC refused an European Union offer to supply transparent ballot boxes free of cost, the sources said. The sources said advocates for the transparent boxes argued that using such boxes would prevent fraudulent practices during the polls and of course, they'd be light-weight and easy to carry. The reorganised Election Commission has declared it will prepare digital voter lists with photos in 18 months and hold the next elections within 2008. The number of voters this time will not exceed 75 million, EC sources surmised.
