 ISLAMABAD, June 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Pakistani analyst launched her book on the military's penetration of the economy on Thursday after she and her publisher said they were forced to change venue at the last minute because of government pressure. The book by Ayesha Siddiqa, a political analyst and former director of research at the Pakistan navy, tackles the virtually taboo subject of the military's huge business empire, which she estimates is worth $10 billion. Siddiqa said she had to cancel the planned launch at the capital's top private club, the Islamabad Club, and had to scramble to find an alternative venue. She said that while writing the book, "Military Inc. Inside Pakistan's Military Economy", many of her friends had tried to warn her off the sensitive subject. "What has happened to the launch today bears witness to the fact that my friends' apprehensions were correct," she told the launch, held in a crowded office of a non-governmental group. "Not only was the Islamabad Club told to cancel the reservation but all hotels in Islamabad were yesterday told not to give their halls." She said the instructions to venues not to host the launch had been issued by the Ministry of Interior. Interior Minister Aftab Ahmed Khan Sherpao and Information Minister Mohammad Ali Durrani said they were not aware of any ban. The Pakistani military has ruled the country for more than half its history since it was carved out of British-ruled India as a home for Muslims in 1947. The book's publication comes at a sensitive time with a campaign for the restoration of full democracy gathering pace since President Pervez Musharraf, who is also army chief, tried to dismiss the country's top judge in March. Speaking before the launch, Siddiqa said the military owned hundreds of businesses across the country, many run by five big conglomerates. The business empire, much of which Siddiqa said was inefficient and run virtually without any transparency or accountability, underpinned the military's political power. But Siddiqa said her book was not intended as an attack on the military. "This is not about criticising the military, this is about bringing improvement to it," she said. Pakistan's main military spokesman was not immediately available for comment. The state-run APP news agency put out a report on Wednesday citing unidentified analysts as saying the book was "a plethora of misleading and concocted stories" aimed at giving the military a bad name and creating a rift with the civil sector. Asked about the news agency report, Siddiqa said: "I think they haven't even read the book.
