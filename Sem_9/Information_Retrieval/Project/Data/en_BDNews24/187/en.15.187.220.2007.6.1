<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jun 1 (bdnews24.com)  Drug manufacturers are frustrated over the delay in approving an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) park project worth Tk 4.5 billion. The project has been awaiting approval of the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC) since February 14. "We don't know actually why the government is delaying approval of the project," Nazmul Hassan, secretary general of Bangladesh Association of Pharmaceutical Industries(BAPI), told bdnews24.com Friday. He said that they would take up the issue with the government soon. On Feb 14, the Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC) and the BAPI signed an understanding deal to establish an API park in Munshiganj to produce pharmaceutical raw materials aimed at boosting exports. The BAPI says that the API park will help them exploit the benefit of exporting patented drugs to 49 least developed fellow countries of Bangladesh until 2016 under a WTO arrangement. According to the agreement, the government is supposed to bear the project cost, Tk 4.5 billion, from its own coffers and build necessary infrastructure by its agency-BSCIC. When asked, a senior BSCIC official, on condition of anonymity, said, "The government now wants to procure land for the park and expects the manufacturers to develop required infrastructure in the area." The official hoped that the problem would be solved soon as the adviser to the ministry of industries had recently written a letter in this regard to the adviser of the Ministry of Planning. "We hope to resolve the problem soon, the official said citing that a meeting on the issue would be held after the budget session. However, the BAPI secretary general, citing examples of other countries such as India, Pakistan and China said that governments in those countries had built infrastructure for the park. "It is not possible for us to develop infrastructure ourselves," he said. Hassan expected that government would positively consider approving the project as it had included the pharmaceutical sector in its export policy. "If we want to take advantage under WTO arrangement, we must develop an API park as soon as possible," the BAPI secretary general said. The BAPI says the park will reduce dependence of 231 drug makers in the country, now importing raw materials from countries such as India, China and Europe. The state-of-the-art API park is supposed to have a central effluent treatment plant, a waste dumping ground and incinerator. Entrepreneurs will get plots inside the park to set up small power plants. bd
