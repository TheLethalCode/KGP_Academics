 Dhaka, June 3 (bdnews24.com) - Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court, Dhaka Sunday sent Awami League presidium member Kazi Zafrullah into a four-day remand for quizzing in an extortion case. Metropolitan magistrate Abdur Rouf Khan approved four days for interrogation after sub-inspector Md Salahuddin of Gulshan Police Station appealed for a seven-day remand. Golam Dastagir Gazi, owner of Gazi Tank, sued the AL leader for extorting Tk 50 lakh. Zafrullah's lawyers Syed Rezaur Rahman, Abul Kalam Azad, Sahara Khatun and Ashraful Haque opposed the remand appeal in court. The court asked the law enforcers to take necessary steps if he fell sick during interrogation. Golam Dastgir Gazi, also an AL leader, filed the case with Gulshan Police Station on May 19. In the case, Gazi alleged that Zafrullah had threatened to harm his business and not to nominate him for parliamentary election if the money is not paid. He paid the money in two installments on April 13-30 at Zafrullah's Banani office. On April 18, joint forces arrested Jafrullah at his Gulshan home. bdnew
