 BRUSSELS, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Europe's food and drink industry must step up its fight against obesity over the next three years or face new regulations, a spokesman for the European Union's health chief said on Wednesday. EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou did not move to impose strict rules on food companies -- like those used to reduce smoking -- when he unveiled his plans to combat obesity. But he warned the industry against complacency. "We urge industry to step up their fight or face new rules," Kyprianou's spokesman Philip Tod said. "This remains a carrot-and-stick approach as we will review the situation in 2010 when we may introduce legislation if not enough action has been taken." Of the 300 million adults worldwide who are technically obese or overweight, over 15 million live in the 27-nation EU. EU figures show an estimated three million European schoolchildren are now obese, and some 85,000 more become so each year. It is forecast that obesity could affect one in 10 children in Europe and Central Asia by 2010. Some consumer groups and non-governmental organisations had sought greater action by Brussels in its strategy paper, released on Wednesday, such as tighter advertising regulations and more specific rules on food labelling. "It seems that the Commission has taken the easy way out by adopting a voluntary approach, combined with policy of wait-and-see," said Jim Murray, director of European Consumers' Organisation BEUC. "We were expecting a much more robust commitment from the Commission, taking a strong stance on nutritional labelling and introducing a binding approach to tackle the issue of advertising to children." The document upholds the model of an "obesity platform", set up by the executive Commission in 2005 following its first discussion paper on the issue. This approach brings industry, consumer groups and health experts together to find ways to combat obesity. But it emphasises self-regulation and pulls away from delivering legislation from Brussels. The paper said the Commission proposed a revision of nutrition labelling, programmes to promote healthy eating, and a study on sport, among other measures. "The Commission will monitor the progress and performance of all actors with a first report due in 2010 and will collaborate with the World Health Organization to improve surveillance of nutrition and physical activity actions and health status in the EU," the paper said
