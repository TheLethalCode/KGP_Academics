<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 2 (bdnews24.com)- Dr Kamal Hossain has said he will provide all cooperation for the formation of a platform for healthy politics. Politicians against whom allegations of corruption have been raised in the past should own up their mistakes and retire from politics. At the same time, considering the issue of corruption, political parties should conduct reforms or purges, he added. Noted politician and jurist Dr Kamal Hossain made these observations in an exclusive interview with bdnews24.com at his chamber in Motijheel commercial area Saturday noon. On the formation of the new party, Dr Kamal said that he would extend all out cooperation to form a platform for a healthy brand of politics. Gano Forum president Dr Kamal Hossain said that it was the time to draw those who wanted to do healthy politics, the time to form a platform so that all could go forward together. On whether people had started expressing their no confidence to those in government over the past 18 years, Dr Kamal said, "People are not bringing no-confidence against political parties. The parties against whom allegations of corruption have been raised should conduct reforms and purges. When a disease afflicts the society, political parties cannot remain free of it. No party can say corruption has not made inroads into it. I have a small party. I will also have to see whether my party is showing the symptoms of the disease. It is natural that the symptom of the disease will be found on a larger scale. And possibilities are there that the symptoms would be found the most in the immediate past ruling party or alliance. When asked whether any other new party was going to be launched he said, "People want healthy politics instead of diseased politics. But the parties that are already in the field need to play a role for returning to healthy politics. If the big parties return to the stream of healthy politics through reform small parties like ours will welcome it. At the same time if any new party wants to join the fray, I will also welcome it. When Prof Yunus announced his joining politics, I welcomed him. Dr Kamal Hossain said, those who became victim of ill politics, against whom allegations of corruption have been raised, they can move away accepting the mistake. In politics, if anybody commits a mistake, he steps down from politics. There are several such instances in different countries. The citizens of the country will also have to be conscious about it. People have voted the same person time and again falling victim to ill politics. When an election is controlled by black money people become helpless. People now want relief from such a situation. In this regard he said, "If we work in unity, good work can be done. Ahead of the election, alliances can be made and what other options are there, can be seen later. Now, I will call upon all to work unitedly for healthy politics. And I am interested about a platform for working in a coordinated way." When asked how far the work of the platform has advanced, Dr Kamal said, "I am getting response. People from different regions of the country are spontaneously telling me about their interest in favour of healthy politics." On whether those taking initiative for a platform were getting any kind of cooperation from the government he said, "They can say this. We are getting help from you - the mass media. If we get your help we don't need any other assistance. We want people's assistance. And we want the help of those who want a healthy political trend." Evaluating the present government Dr Kamal Hossain said, a serious situation had built up in the country in the last several years. On the one hand, terrorism, corruption, politicization and militancy and, on the other, a consensus among the common people for a meaningful change had grown. People wanted to bring about the change through a fair election in a democratic environment. Besides, different political parties, professional organisations and civil society wanted election of honest and efficient people through proper election. When it was clear that defying all demands the January 22 election was being imposed, the incidents of January 11 reflecting the aspirations of the people took place, resulting in the unwanted election getting cancelled. The people welcomed it. After that a process started. A non-party caretaker government was formed and they in a few days reformed the election commission, and the independent anticorruption commission started work. Dr Kamal said that the government must provide legal help to the election commission. The anticorruption commission will have to take steps to perform their responsibilities properly. Replying to another question, Dr Kamal said that some steps were essential for an election free from the influence of black money. Action must be taken against big corruption. Action against big corruption must be taken by the deadline set for holding the election. The government will have to help the ACC with money and workforce for the purpose. However, seeing the steps taken by the government, it now seems the government is active in this regard, he went on to
