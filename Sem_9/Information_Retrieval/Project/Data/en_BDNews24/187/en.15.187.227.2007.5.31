<TEXT>
 MADRID, May 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Uncapped striker Roberto Soldado is determined to grasp his opportunity with both hands in Spain's Group F Euro 2008 qualifier against Latvia on Saturday. With Fernando Torres withdrawing from the squad through injury, Soldado is strongly tipped to get a run-out in Riga and the 22-year-old Osasuna striker is in confident mood. "We all know what Fernando means to this team and he has been a key player in attack," Soldado told a news conference on Wednesday. "He was really unlucky to get injured but I'm here to step into his shoes and if I play I hope to do as well or even better than he has." Soldado, who has scored 11 league goals since joining Osasuna in a loan deal from Real Madrid at the start of the season, is likely to partner the live-wire David Villa up front. "It's going to be very easy to play with a player of his quality," he said. "We have different styles ... but we compliment each other very well and I hope we can help Spain get three important points on Saturday." Lying in third place in the group, three points behind Sweden and four behind leaders Northern Ireland, Spain have little room for error against Latvia if they are to continue their recovery after a poor start to qualification. NARROW WINS Back-to-back defeats by Northern Ireland and Sweden threatened to derail their campaign, but narrow wins over Denmark and Iceland mean qualification is now back in their own hands. Coach Luis Aragones has recalled Joaquin to the squad and is likely to give the talented but inconsistent midfielder a run out on the right wing as he looks for ways to break down the Latvia defence. Aragones's only other doubt is on the left side of midfield. The in-form David Silva has muscle problems and Barcelona's Andres Iniesta could take his place or even slot in behind Villa instead of Soldado. Latvia have won just one of their qualifiers, an emphatic 4-0 victory over Iceland, but they have lost their three others including an embarrassing 1-0 defeat away to Liechtenstein last time out. Aleksandrs Starkovs, who led Latvia to qualification for Euro 2004, returned to take charge of the team after the Liechtenstein defeat but has kept faith with the same core of players for the Spain match. Midfielder Imants Bleidelis will win his 100th cap if he plays on Saturday. Probable teams: Latvia: Aleksandrs Kolinko; Deniss Ivanovs, Dzintars Zirnis, Arturs Zakresevskis, Igors Stepanovs; Vitalijs Astafjevs, Juris Laizans, Imants Bleidelis, Andrejs Rubins; Maris Verpakovskis, Andrejs Prohorenkovs Spain: Iker Casillas; Sergio Ramos, Carles Puyol, Carlos Marchena, Joan Capdevila; Joaquin, Xavi, David Albelda, David Silva; Roberto Soldado or Andres Iniesta, David Vill
