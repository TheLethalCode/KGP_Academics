 KIEV, June 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Viktor Yushchenko on Friday offered Ukraine's parliament a second one-day extension to approve legislation needed for a September election intended to solve the ex-Soviet state's long-running political crisis. The assembly, hostile to the pro-Western president, was in session after missing deadlines two days in a row to pass the legislative package needed for the September 30 snap election to parliament to proceed. Three key measures must still be adopted. The date for the election was set under a deal the president struck last weekend with his rival from the 2004 "Orange Revolution", Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich. The two men held talks on Friday before Yushchenko granted the extension by decree. Yushchenko also met the leader of the opposition, former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who now backs him after a period of estrangement and is the most ardent advocate of an early election. The president had threatened on Thursday to call the election earlier -- within 60 days -- if parliament failed to pass all the required measures by the end of the day. More than 160 opposition deputies had signed declarations giving up their seats -- creating conditions for a formal dissolution of parliament and the immediate election call. Parliament on Thursday gave initial approval to budget changes, including election finance, and then passed 10 bills needed for Ukraine to join the World Trade Organisation, part of the legislative package. Yushchenko has promoted long-term European Union and NATO membership since defeating Yanukovich in the rerun of a rigged 2004 presidential poll. European leaders, who backed Yushchenko in his allegations of electoral fraud in the 2004 protests, have this time taken no sides and expressed dismay at the protracted crisis. Yushchenko dissolved parliament by decree in April and ordered the poll, but a date was set only after much wrangling
