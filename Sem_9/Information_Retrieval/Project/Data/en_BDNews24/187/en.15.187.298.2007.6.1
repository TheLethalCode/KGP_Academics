 LONDON, June 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares rose early on Friday, echoing gains in global equities, although investors were cautious ahead of a key read on the US labour market later in the session. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.3 percent to 1,616.72 points, having hit an early six-and-a-half year high of 1,616.98 points. "Ahead of the data in the US we will just stay on the sidelines, in part considering that we're close to the weekend," said Heino Ruland, an analyst at German brokerage Steubing in Frankfurt. "I assume that we will see some support, whether that is going to be M&A is a different question," he said. The US government employment report is expected to show 130,000 workers were added to non-farm payrolls in May, compared with April's 88,000 increase. One of the top gaining sectors were technology stocks, with Dutch chip equipment maker ASML up 1.8 percent, while Germany's Infineon rose nearly 2 percent after US computer maker Dell Inc on Thursday posted strong results. Elsewhere in Europe, London's FTSE 100 index rose 0.3 percent, while Frankfurt's DAX gained 0.4 percent and Paris' CAC 40 rose 0.3 percent
