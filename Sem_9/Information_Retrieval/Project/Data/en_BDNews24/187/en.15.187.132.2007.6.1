<TITLE> China promises clean-up after algae shuts city water </TITLE>

 BEIJING, June 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese officials promised swift steps on Friday to clean up a lake after an algae outbreak choked off water to an eastern city amid a public outcry about the nation's tainted water sources. Taihu Lake in Jiangsu province has been struck by a rapidly spreading canopy of blue-green algae that has left water supplies for nearby Wuxi putrid and undrinkable. Convoys of trucks have been taking bottled water for residents. The provincial Communist Party chief, Li Yuanchao, said the water was improving as officials drew flows from the Yangtze River and stopped pumping in waste, according to a report posted by the State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) (www.sepa.gov.cn). But he acknowledged that the scare exposed deeper failings. "In future development we must be determined to make stronger efforts to clean up Taihu Lake and ensure its water quality and safety," Li said. Small chemical plants around the lake must be closed and more waste water plants must be built, he ordered. A city official, Zhu Zhongxian, claimed that the water was now safe -- despite the nauseating stench. "Water quality on every indicator meets national standards and it's not toxic," the Nanjing Morning Post quoted him as saying. Zhu was also forced to deny Internet-fed rumours that Wuxi would blow up a dyke to allow an influx of water into the lake. But residents and media said the emergency steps, which include attempts to seed clouds and bring rain, exposed a long-term failure to protect lakes and rivers, battered by pollution and strained by population and economic growth. In 2005, millions of residents of Harbin in northeast China had their taps turned off for weeks after a toxic spill. "We've got a lot of complaints," one Wuxi resident, an engineer surnamed Xiang, told Reuters by phone. "The impact on our life has been very big. The government should be monitoring beforehand. Don't wait until something explodes and it's too late until you deal with it." The problem was a symptom of widespread environmental destruction threatening water sources, said one commentator. "Along with our country's rapid economic growth there's been a constant build-up of pollution and checks on it have lagged," said the commentary on the Web site of the People's Daily, the Communist Party's newspaper (www.people.com.cn). "Our country's environmental protection has reached a crisis point." Many of China's lakes and rivers are threatened by run-off from fertilisers, dumped industrial waste and untreated sewage. Algae blooms can burst out in water rich in nutrients from farm and domestic run-off, which Taihu Lake has in abundance. Pollution in the lake in April was at 5 on a scale from 1 to 5, meaning that untreated it was suitable only for irrigation and people should not touch it, according to SEPA data. It was the same one year ago, the data showed. China plans to provide safe drinking water for all by 2015, the China Daily citied Minister of Water Resources Chen Lei as saying. About 300 million people in the country of over 1.3 billion still do not have access to clean water, another official told the paper. Wuxi is a thriving industrial centre with an urban population of more than 2.3 million, surrounded by intensely cultivated farmland. Residents voiced frustration, but not outright panic. "I haven't washed for days. We can only rub down, and use bottled water for food, drink and washing," said Wang Chunye, a mining company worker. "The government has not taken the environment seriously enough. The whole effort is still not very effective. This has happened before, but it was especially bad this year.
