 KATHMANDU, May 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nepal will hold elections in November or December for a constituent assembly to decide the fate of its monarchy, capping a peace deal with former Maoist rebels after a decade-long insurgency, political officials said on Thursday. The election was once expected in June but officials had said they did not have enough time to organise the vote that soon. The agreement will help end political uncertainty sparked by the election delay and help seal the peace deal that ended a civil war which killed more than 13,000 people. On Thursday, Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala met with Maoist chief Prachanda and other leaders from the ruling coalition and agreed to reschedule the polls for the Nepali month that starts on Nov 17. "The cabinet will formally decide the exact date for the elections soon," said Prakash Sharan Mahat, senior leader of the Nepali Congress (Democratic) party, a key member of the ruling coalition. "The timing was suggested by the prime minister and other leaders agreed," he said. Maoist politicians also said the election would be held in that period. The assembly, a key demand of the Maoists, is meant to draft a new constitution for Nepal and decide the future of a monarchy that Maoists want abolished. The former guerrillas, who also joined an interim parliament in January, say Nepal should be turned into a republic through parliament
