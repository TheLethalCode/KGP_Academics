<TITLE> Ashraful new captain, Mashrafee his deputy </TITLE>

 Dhaka, June 02 (bdnews24.com) Bangladesh Cricket Board Saturday named Mohammad Ashraful captain and Mashrafee Bin Mortaza his deputy for both Test and ODI matches until the Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa in September. Ashraful's first mission will be to lead the Tigers against the World Cup runners-up Sri Lanka in three Tests and as many ODIs. The board also picked Shaun Williams for Bangladesh's tour of Sri Lanka, with Sarwar Imran his deputy. Ali Asif Khan will be the manager. The 22-year-old Ashraful, who has played 35 tests and 101 ODIs, made his debut in the ODIs in April 2001 against Zimbabwe. He shot into fame that very year, top-scoring in both innings of his debut Test and hit a brilliant ton in the second innings against the mighty Lankan spinners on a square turner at Colombo. He turned a terrible mismatch into a slice of history by becoming the youngest-ever Test centurion. But such an early achievement proved hard to live up to and after a prolonged loss of form, Ashraful was dropped in 2003 when England visited Bangladesh for the first time. However, the flamboyant right-hander was in the side late in 2004 and hammered a glorious unbeaten 158 against India at Chittagong. He confirmed his status as the one for the future at Cardiff, when his brilliantly-paced century set Bangladesh up for a shock win over world champions Australia in the NatWest Series in 2005. Ashraful could not do justice to his potential on the following tour of Sri Lanka and made little impact against the Australians early in 2006. An extended run of poor form forced the management to drop Ashraful once more. The little genius staged yet another comeback to the national fold and soon proved his splendor by slamming 263 for Dhaka Division against Chittagong Division in the domestic four-day competition. In 2007 World Cup Ashraful once again fired Bangladesh to a famous win over top-ranked South Africa by 67 runs. He is the most natural choice to lead the Tigers after the resignation of Habibul Bashar. Mashrafee, who has played 22 Test matches and 66 ODIs, got the new responsibility as a reward for his consistent performance in the recent years depsite nagging injury problems. He snapped six for 26 against Kenya to snatch the best bowling figures by a Bangladeshi from Aftab Ahmed. No mug with the bat either, his batting form has been very good recently as he played two attacking innings of 79 and 70 against India in the Tests in Dhaka and won the man-of-the-match award in the first Test. The consistency has seen him make it to the Asian squad alongside veteran left-arm spinner Mohammad Rafique in place of Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar for the Afro-Asia Cup beginning next month in India. Mortaza is also part of the Asian Twenty20 international squad for the one-off match on June 5 in Bangalore. bdnews24
