 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, June 1 (bdnews24.com) An acute shortage of ice is making it difficult for traders to preserve fish resulting in the rotting of large quantities of fish and a supply shortfall. Ice factories cannot produce the required quantity of this most important material for fish preservation because of the prevalent chronic load shedding, fish and ice traders complain. Fish traders said that they were unwilling to bring in huge quantities of hilsa fish now being trawled in the Bay, mainly due to the shortage of ice in the market. The fish wholesalers at Karwan Bazaar said that the price of ice blocks had increased manifold. Ice worth Tk 50-60 was selling at Tk 200-300. Many wholesalers were buying ice from ice-cream factories at exorbitant prices. Huge quantities of fish were rotting due to scarcity of ice forcing traders to sell at very low prices, and incur losses, they said. Thursday morning, 80 hilsas were sold at Tk 8,000 whereas the same number of fish sold at Tk 12,000 only a few days ago. Retailer Harun Al Rashid said that they were buying ice at four times the actual price. The price of fish had also gone up while unsold fish was rotting due to ice shortage. Md Khokon, a Karwan Bazar ice seller said that production had fallen due to frequent and prolonged power cuts. On the other hand, though fish catches have been bountiful of late, preservation has not been possible due to acute shortage of ice in the market. The owner of Alo Ice of Lalbagh said that they could not produce quality ice due to erratic supply of electricity compounded with low voltage. Low quality ice melts quickly, resulting in decomposition of the merchandise preserved, he said. A Power Development Board source said that total load-shedding amounted to 1074 MW Thursday, which was 1131, 1212 and 1197 on May 30, 29 and 28. bdnews24.com/
