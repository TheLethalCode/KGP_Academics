<TITLE> Croatia to speed up EU membership talks: officials </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ZAGREB, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Croatia is expected to speed up the pace of its European Union membership talks by opening up to six more negotiating chapters next month, an EU official said on Wednesday. The former Yugoslav republic launched the talks on bringing its legislation in line with that of the wealthy bloc in October 2005. The small Adriatic country of 4.4 million people is almost certain to become the EU's 28th member. So far it has opened only six of the 35 negotiating points, or "chapters". Its slow progress has been in part due to wrangling between Brussels and fellow EU candidate Turkey, which started accession talks at the same time. "We hope that after the EU summit in June, Croatia will have 10 to 12 chapters open. That will be substantial progress," the EU Commission's envoy in Zagreb, Vincent Degert, told reporters. "We have already said 2007 was a decisive year, when we should see acceleration of the talks, first in June and then under the Portuguese presidency," he said. Portugal takes over the 6-month rotating EU chairmanship from Germany in July. A Croatian government source said Zagreb had handed in its negotiating positions for 14 chapters in all. "It is hard to say how many will be opened in June because we are now waiting for the EU to adopt its own position, agreed by all member states," the source said. Croatia tentatively hopes to conclude negotiations by 2009 and join a year or two later, although that may also depend on how quickly the EU agrees its future constitutional arrangement. "The plan is to open as many chapters this year as possible and close as many next year. The Portuguese have told us they want full speed, a success story for the region," the source said. Brussels has so far refrained from setting an entry date and has urged Croatia to speed up reforms of its inefficient judiciary and public administration, cut state subsidies and fight corruption. Of the six former Yugoslav republics, only Slovenia has joined the EU so far. Macedonia has been granted candidate status and Montenegro hopes to achieve the same next year. Serbia, the biggest of them, is likely to resume talks soon on an associate pact with the EU, after its new government indicated readiness to cooperate with the UN war crimes tribunal. Bosnia's association accord has been suspended because of its failure to unify its Serb and Muslim-Croat police forces
