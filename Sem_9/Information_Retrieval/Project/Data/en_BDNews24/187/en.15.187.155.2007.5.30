<TITLE> Jakarta governor fumes over Australian summons </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JAKARTA, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jakarta's governor said on Wednesday that he had cut short an official visit to Australia after police served him a summons to testify in an inquest into the 1975 killing of five Australian journalists in East Timor. Governor Sutiyoso, a former general who served in East Timor at the start of Indonesian occupation of the territory, said two officers barged into his hotel room in Sydney on Tuesday and asked him to sign the invitation to testify in the coronial inquest. "I refused to sign it. I told them I have nothing to do with the case," Sutiyoso told reporters in Jakarta, adding the officers had obtained a master key from the hotel. "I was angry because I was not supposed to be treated like that as a state official who came on an official invitation." He said that following the incident he immediately left Australia even though he was scheduled to visit Canberra on Wednesday. The Sydney inquest into the death of the five Australia-based journalists has heard they were deliberately gunned down by Indonesian soldiers. Official reports have blamed the deaths of the five newsmen on Oct. 16, 1975 on crossfire, as Indonesian forces entered East Timor in an incursion ahead of a full-scale invasion of the territory in December of the same year. Sutiyoso said he served in East Timor in 1975 but he and troops under his command had never been stationed in Balibo, where the journalists were killed. "I really feel insulted," he said. "I think this incident happened because NGOs (non-governmental organisations) there gave false information about me." Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda telephoned Australian Ambasador Bill Farmer to seek clarification, foreign ministry spokesman Kristiarto Legowo said. Legowo said Wirajuda was told the Australian Federal government had nothing to do with the inquest. Under Australia's foreign immunity act, visiting foreign visitors are protected from court orders related to domestic matters, he said. About 30 Indonesians rallied outside the Australian embassy on Wednesday to protest over the reported treatment of Sutiyoso. Some threw eggs at the embassy building. In March the court hearing the inquest issued a warrant for the arrest of former Indonesian general Yunus Yosfiah, who has been accused of ordering the execution of the newsmen. Yosfiah has repeatedly denied the accusations. The journalists' deaths prompted long-running allegations of a government cover-up in both Indonesia and Australia. Indonesia-Australia ties have been strained in the past over issues such as East Timor and refugees. Long-time colonial ruler Portugal had effectively withdrawn from East Timor in 1975 ahead of the Indonesian invasion. Decades of Indonesian rule were met with armed resistance and ended in an overwhelming vote for independence in 1999
