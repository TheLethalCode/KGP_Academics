 KABUL, May 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Taliban fire may have brought down a military helicopter in which seven NATO soldiers were killed, alliance officials said, while in a separate incident 16 policemen died in a Taliban ambush. The Taliban said 35 people died in the helicopter crash in Helmand province in southern Afghanistan. Hours after the helicopter went down, the Taliban ambushed a police convoy on a main road in southern Zabul province and killed 16 policemen, the interior ministry said. Since the traditional winter lull, the resurgent Taliban have stepped up actions in recent months with a series of suicide attacks, roadside bombs and ambushes against foreign and Afghan forces. In an apparent response to the Chinook crash, a joint NATO and Afghan raid supported by air power killed and wounded dozens of Taliban in Sangin district, close to Kajaki where the twin-rotor NATO helicopter went down on Wednesday night, the Afghan defence ministry said. NATO said the fighting was part of a broader offensive called "Operation Lastay Kulang," from the local Pashto language for "axe handle," meant to extend the Afghan government's control into the north of Helmand province. Officials said 2,000 foreign and Afghan troops, including 1,000 British soldiers and elements of the elite U.S. 82nd Airborne Division, were involved in a push to loosen the Taliban's grip on the Sangin Valley. Helmand, a long-time bastion of the Taliban, is the leading drug-producing region of Afghanistan, the world's main heroin supplier. It has been the scene of a series of bloody fights between Taliban and Western forces in recent months. "It was a hostile area where the helicopter went down," Major John Thomas, a spokesman for NATO in Afghanistan, told Reuters. "And initial indications are that enemy fire may have brought down the helicopter." Taliban spokesman Qari Mohammad Yousuf said the death toll of 35 came from secret sources in Helmand. Taliban claims on foreign deaths are often exaggerated. NATO said seven soldiers were killed in the crash and called the Taliban claim "absurd". Five of the soldiers were believed to be Americans. The other two were British and Canadian, military officials in London and Ottawa said. The Canadian was identified as Master Corporal Darrell Priede, a military cameraman serving with the army. A Chinook can carry 28 combat-equipped troops, a US military official said. At least 55 U.S. soldiers have been killed in five previous Chinook crashes in Afghanistan in the past two years. The Chinook went down in the Kajaki region where the Afghan government is seeking to tighten security in order to rebuild a dam and hydro-electric project. Taliban leaders have threatened in recent weeks to step up attacks on foreign troops and said they have trained hundreds of suicide bombers. Last year's fighting between Western forces and the militants was the bloodiest since the USled overthrow of the Taliban in 2001. The guerrillas are active largely in southern and eastern areas of Afghanistan, where more than 5,000 people have been killed in the past 16 months. The violence is rising despite the presence of nearly 50,000 foreign troops led by NATO and the U.S. military as well as about 100,000 Afghan security forc
