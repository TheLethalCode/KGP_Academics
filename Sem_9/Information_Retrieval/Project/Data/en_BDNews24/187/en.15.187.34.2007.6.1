 MUMBAI, June 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian shares rose 0.7 percent on Friday to within striking distance of an all-time high, led by gains in Infosys Technologies Ltd. and supported by firmer Asian markets. At 10:25 am, the 30-share BSE index was up 104.17 points at 14,648.63, with all but two components trading in the positive territory. The benchmark has risen 18 percent since April and is just 0.5 percent below its record high of 14,723.88 hit on Feb 9. "The market should be volatile in the short term. If the index is able to sustain these levels for two to three days, then we should touch 15,000 pretty soon," said Niraj Deewan, director at Quantum Securities. "The global markets have run up quite sharply in the past few weeks and a consolidation is expected to happen in the coming days. We should also correct when the global market gets into a consolidation mode." Infosys, India's second-largest software exporter, gained nearly 1 percent to 1,938.95 rupees after an overnight rally in technology stocks in the United States, traders said. Shares in Infosys have fallen about 9 percent since March on concerns that a strong rupee will eat into the earnings of export-driven software companies. The rupee , which has risen more than 9 percent this year, was trading at 40.53 per dollar. On Monday, it had hit 40.28 -- its strongest since May 1998. United Breweries (Holdings) was up 7 percent at 730.90 rupees, after rising 10 percent in early deals. The firm, which runs unlisted Kingfisher Airlines, said on Thursday it would buy 26 percent of budget carrier Deccan Aviation. Bangalore-based Deccan Aviation rose 4.3 percent to 152.50 rupees. In the broader market, there were 1,203 gainers against 472 losers on volume of about 36 million shares. The 50-issue NSE index, or Nifty, climbed to a record 4,321.90 in opening deals and was at 4,318.30, up 0.5 percent. Emkay Share & Stock Brokers said in a research note that it maintained its short-term target of 4,454 for Nifty. Elsewhere in the region, Colombo's All-Share index was up 0.33 percent to 2,516.46. Karachi's 100-share index gained 0.07 percent to 12,970.57, after hitting a record 13,036.60 in early deals. STOCKS ON THE MOVE Plastic products maker Sintex Industries Ltd Was up 3 percent at 233 rupees after its board approved acquiring 81 percent in US-based Wausaukee Composites Inc for an undisclosed sum. Tata Tea Ltd rose 3.2 percent to 950.15 rupees after a television channel said on Thursday the firm would buy 11 percent of an Indian mineral water maker. The company reports its quarterly earnings later in the day.
