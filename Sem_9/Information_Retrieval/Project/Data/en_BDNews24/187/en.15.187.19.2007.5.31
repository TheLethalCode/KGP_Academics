 MUMBAI, May 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Indian court sentenced two people to life in prison on Thursday for their role in the country's worst bombings, which killed 257 people in Mumbai in 1993. The court also sentenced five people to between five and 10 years in jail. The seven men, among 100 convicted, were found guilty of crimes such as planning the attacks, possessing illegal weapons and ferrying explosives. Thursday's rulings took the total number sentenced so far to 58 after one of the world's longest trials ended last year. Those sentenced to date include smugglers, petty criminals and also policemen and customs officials who took bribes to let the explosives through. An 83-year-old man was sent to jail for life for planning the blasts. Still to come is the high profile sentencing of Bollywood star Sanjay Dutt, convicted of buying illegal weapons from those involved in the blasts. No date has been set for his order. Police say the bombings were ordered by alleged mafia don Dawood Ibrahim -- a Muslim and India's most wanted man -- to avenge the 1992 destruction of an ancient mosque by Hindu zealots. Ibrahim is believed to be living in Pakistan
