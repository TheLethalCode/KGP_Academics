 MOSCOW, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia sees direct talks between Belgrade and Pristina as the only solution to the future of Serbia's Kosovo province, Russian news agencies quoted Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov as saying on Wednesday. "The fate of Kosovo, the fate of Serbia as a whole should be decided through their direct talks rather than in New York, Potsdam or in any other formats," Interfax news agency quoted Lavrov as saying in the German city of Potsdam. Russia, a long-time Serbian ally, opposes a plan proposed by by United Nations mediator Martti Ahtisaari offering the Albanian majority province independence under international supervision. Serbia rules out independence for Kosovo. Russia, a veto-wielding member of the U.N. Security Council, says it will not back any plan for Kosovo's future which is not acceptable to Belgrade. Kosovo, an irritant in relations between Russia and the West, is sure to be a topic at the summit of Group of Eight industrialised nations in Germany next week. Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President George W Bush, who will attend the summit and also hold a separate meeting on its fringes, discussed Kosovo by telephone on Tuesday
