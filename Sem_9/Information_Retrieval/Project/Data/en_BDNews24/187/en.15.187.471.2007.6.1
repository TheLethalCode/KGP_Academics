 Mokarram Hossain Shuvo bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, June 1 (bdnews24.com)University Grants Commission chairman Prof Nazrul Islam says the 1973 University Ordinance may be amended, if need be, to discipline four public universities. The UGC chief indicates that the ordinance makes teachers accountable only to their "conscience" but there were no clear job descriptions for them. But the former Dhaka University teacher says job descriptions should be laid down in consultation with teachers. "Imposing anything won't be right." In an exclusive interview with bdnews24.com, Prof Islam has talked about higher education, public and private universities, teacher and student politics and other related issues. On a question on the government's initiative to amend the university orders, the commission chairman said they might be amended in line with the need of the hour. However, the amendment should be done after consulting with teachers, he says. "The government should not rush into a decision. Work should be done carefully through discussions, upholding freethinking and democracy." In the country, the number of students at university level is 13 lakh now. By 2026, the number will rise to 35 lakh, the UGC said in a strategic plan that covers 20 years. "Given this background, a well-thought-out plan is necessary to meet the increased demand of higher education." "There should be a specific plan about how much burden the public universities would take and how private universities would be developed." "We have to take a decision on how many doors we will open to foreign universities in the open-market economy," the UGC chairman says. Prof Islam says the National University should be overhauled to meet the ever-increasing need of education. The state-run university needs to be given a new shape to meet ever-increasing demand and ensure the quality of education, he says. "Seventy-five percent of graduate students are studying in colleges under the National University. Quality education should be ensured in these institutions at comparatively low costs." The UGC chairman says the gap in the quality of education between public and private universities is also widening. A process is underway to shape up an accreditation council to solve the problem of rankings for universities. "It will give the students and their guardians indications about the quality of education of the universities," he says. "Meritorious students will get the chance to make up their minds on admission. As the students and their guardians would get an idea about the quality of private universities they would not be cheated or deprived." Prof Islam suggests that the government should bring some changes to the UGC structure, which is necessary to keep pace with time. "The powers of the UGC need to increase too," Prof Islam says. "Although the commission is largely independent, it has to compromise with the education ministry." Prof Islam says the autonomy of public universities is often compromised as they depend on the government for funds. "For the same reason, the universities should increase funds from their own resources." On recent UGC probes into public universities, Prof Islam says the commission lacks manpower and efficiency to deal with the huge work. The commission conducted the investigations at the directive of the education ministry. "Most irregularities detected in the probes could be solved. For bigger incidents, stern punishment should be given." Prof Islam says the commission got clear insights into indiscipline in the management of the universities thanks to the probes. "Preparations to make rules on appointment of teachers, officials and employees to the public universities are now at the final stage." "Recruitment rules with minimum conditions will be mandatory. However, if the universities want more, they can make a better framework themselves. On banning or reforming student politics, he says the negative trend of student politics cannot be supported. "But we should not forget its glorious past. The present trend of student politics can be reformed. Student organisations themselves can do it." bndenws
