<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Wednesday started hearing a fresh corruption case against former president and Jatiya Party chief HM Ershad. The dissolved Bureau of Anticorruption filed the case in 1991 charging Ershad and five others with links to a Bangladesh Shilpa Bank (BSB) loan write-off. Complainant and officer of the bureau Golam Mortuza testified to the court of Dhaka Divisional Special Judge Malik Abdullah Al Amin. Ershad's lawyer Sheikh Sirajul Islam cross-examined Mortuza after his testimony was recorded. The same court, however, did not record the statement of former Bangladesh Television chief engineer SD Khan in another corruption case against Ershad over electronic news gathering (ENG) as the prosecution failed to produce evidence before the court. Four witnesses earlier testified to the court. No witnesses were present on the day at the hearings for two more graft cases against the former military strongman involving radar purchase and land phone installation. The court set June 18 for hearing the witnesses involved in the BSB loan and ENG cases and June 25 for hearing the witnesses involved in the cases of radar purchase and land phone installation in 89 upazilas. Ershad was present when the court heard the BSB loan case. Another accused in the case, AKM Mosharraf Hossain, former energy minister and the then chairman of the BSB board of directors, was taken to the court from jail custody. The bureau filed a case with Motijheel Police Station on 22 April 1991 accusing Ershad, Mosharraf and four others of getting written off a Tk 35 lakh loan disbursed to Three Star Poultry Farm. The ENG corruption case was filed on 29 February 1992 with Tejgaon Police Station and the land phone installation case in early September 1992 with Ramna Police Station. The radar purchase corruption case was filed in May 1992 with Tejgaon Police Station. bdnews24
