 FRANKFURT, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares fell in early trade on Wednesday, following losses in Asian markets after China tripled a share-trading tax to cool its red-hot market, while banking stocks added to further losses. Banking stocks weighed the most with the DJ Stoxx European banking sector index down 0.6 percent and Royal Bank of Scotland down 1.6 percent, and Barclays and ABN AMRO down about 1 percent each. In the latest development in a battle to clinch the world's biggest bank takeover, the Dutch bank said its supervisory board will form a transaction committee to deal with matters related to the offers made by Barclays and the RBS consortium. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index fell 0.6 percent to 1,592.18 points at 0752 GMT, Earlier China's Ministry of Finance raised stamp duty on share transactions to 0.3 percent from 0.1 percent in what was seen as the strongest attempt yet to curb speculation in a market that had risen more than 60 percent so far this year. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index was down 6.5 percent, having fallen as much as 7.4 percent earlier. "This could trigger a correction, but we don't see a change in the overall trend," said Thomas Gruener, an analyst at Landesbank Berlin. "The environment for equities is still very good," he added. In other European markets, London's FTSE 100 index fell 0.7 percent, Frankfurt's DAX dropped 0.8 percent and Paris' CAC 40 shed 0.7 percent. GlaxoSmithKline shares fell 2.3 percent after Merrill Lynch cut its rating for Europe's biggest drug maker to "sell" from "neutral", traders said. The DJStoxx European healthcare index fell 0.8 percent. Norway's Statoil dipped 1.4 percent after it posted a bigger than expected 28 percent fall in its first-quarter operating profit due to lower oil and gas prices. Oil prices held at $68 a barrel ahead of US inventory data expected to show rising crude and fuel stocks. Other oil majors including BP, Total and Royal Dutch Shell were all down about 0.5 percent. Elsewhere, shares in BMW fell 1.1 percent after Ford Motor Co said it was not in discussions aimed at a sale of its Swedish unit Volvo. BMW shares had gained in the previous session after newspaper reports said the German car maker was a potential buyer of Volvo. Later in the session, at 1800 GMT, investors will focus on minutes of the Federal Reserve's last rate-setting meeting for clues on the future path of monetary policy. The employment report for May by Automatic Data Processing (ADP), due at 1215 GMT, is also likely to draw investors' attention to the monthly US payrolls figure due on Friday.
