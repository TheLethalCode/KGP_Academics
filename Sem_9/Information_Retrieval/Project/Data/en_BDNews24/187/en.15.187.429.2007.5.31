 TEHRAN, May 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran's government is coming under pressure from lawmakers to further postpone planned rationing of heavily-subsidised gasoline, Iranian media reported on Thursday. In a bid to rein in soaring consumption and imports, OPEC's no 2 oil producer raised the litre price by 25 percent to 1,000 rials (about 11 US cents) on May 22, but it delayed a scheme to also introduce rationing until around June 5. Iran imports about 40 percent of its gasoline needs because of a lack of refining capacity. Officials say the price hike and rationing would cut such dependency, at a time when Iran faces more UN sanctions over its disputed nuclear programme. But it is a sensitive issue in a country where many people see cheap and abundant fuel as a national right. The head of parliament's energy committee, Kamal Daneshyar, was quoted as saying about 100 MPs in the 290-member assembly have signed a plan calling for a three-month delay to give the government more time to prepare. Media reports have suggested technical hitches in the distribution of the electronic smart cards people will use to buy the rationed gasoline. The government also has yet to announce the amount of rationed gasoline motorists will be allowed to buy as well as the price of non-rationed fuel. "Although the cabinet has voiced its readiness to start rationing gasoline as of June 5 the promise will most likely be unfulfilled," Daneshyar said in comments on the Oil Ministry's web site Shana. Another member of the energy committee, Seyyed Emad Hosseini, criticised the government for failing to announce how much rationed gasoline motorists would be able to buy. " ... necessary arrangements have not yet been made and if the law takes effect people will face great problems," he said, according to the English-language Tehran Times. World powers have already imposed two sets of sanctions on Iran for refusing to halt its nuclear work, which they fear is aimed at making atom bombs. The United States has said Iran's dependency on fuel imports gave Washington "leverage." Iran says its nuclear work is only aimed at generating electricity so that it can export more of its gas and oil. Economists say the fuel subsidies encourage waste, hurt the environment and burden the budget. Iran last year spent $5 billion on gasoline imports. A top Iranian oil official this week said the country will gradually decrease its gasoline imports by about 10 million litres (63,000 barrels) per day, or 30 percent, once it starts rationing fuel
