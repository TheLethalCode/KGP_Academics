 JOHANNESBURG, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa's targeted CPIX inflation pierced the upper end of the central bank's band in April, rising 6.3 percent year-on-year, official data showed, and hardening the case for higher interest rates. Figures from Statistics South Africa showed that key measure jumped from 5.5 percent in March on higher food and fuel costs, while the all-items consumer price index increased by an annual rate of 7.0 percent, from 6.1 percent previously. A Reuters poll had predicted that CPIX would rise by 5.9 percent while CPI would grow by 6.5 percent. The data knocked government bonds and the rand currency, with the market further discounting an interest rate increase at the central bank's June 6-7 policy meeting. The rand weakened to 7.19 to the dollar from 7.1705 before the release, while yield on the short-dated R153 bond due 2010 jumped to its highest since December last year, a rise of 14 basis points to 8.32 percent on the day. Analysts said the data could push the Reserve Bank to raise interest rates again, despite the primary cause for the jump being external factors and outside the control of the central bank. "This is really terrible news for South Africa. The credibility that the Reserve Bank has built up for the last couple of years will take a huge knock because of this," said Dawie Roodt, economist at Efficient Research. The central bank left rates unchanged in February and April although it had based its most recent decision on a forecast of inflation peaking at 5.9 percent. "The chances have improved that the next move in interest rates should be higher, but I still question if that should happen," said Colen Garrow, economist at Brait. "The things (higher food and international oil prices) that are driving this are beyond everybody's control. To put rates up now would penalise the consumer and put the growth pattern at risk," Garrow said. Domestic fuel prices has risen sharply so far this year and another rise is expected in June, with international Brent crude oil prices remain close to $70 a barrell
