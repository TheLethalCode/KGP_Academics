 Sohel Parvez bdnews24.com Business Correspondent Dhaka, May 31 (bdnews24.com) - The main index on the Dhaka Stock Exchange crossed 2000 points Thursday, the highest in the history of the country's prime bourse. A month-long steady rally with occasional slips in the shares of banks, power companies and pharmaceuticals powered the DGEN or the general index that started its journey on Nov 27, 2001 with a base index of 817.62 points. The new high surpassed the previous benchmark at 1999.71 points, recorded on Jan 1, 2005. In November of the bubble year 1996, the DSE all-share price index touched 4847 points. Thanks to the portfolio investors who returned to the market in early May, the bourse shook off worries over a broader crackdown on corruption and tax-dodging. Good corporate fundamentals, mainly from banks, boosted investor confidence. An investor conference in Dhaka, attended mainly by global institutions and fixed income investors, also injected vigour into the market, experts said. The result was a steady increase in share prices and turnover amid increased participation of retail, local and foreign portfolio investors. Daily average turnover, which was Tk 72.74 million in early May, rose to Tk 1.44 billion on May 20-24. It stood at Tk 1.67 billion on average Thursday. "It's a big achievement. This might encourage big multinationals to go public," said Mohammed Nasir Uddin Chowdhury, chief of LankaBangla Securities, who saw the investor conference as a turning point for the market. "We have been able to showcase our opportunities and strengths to both local and foreign institutional investors at the conference. We had revealed the potential to many market players," he said. Market capitalisation on the DSE touched Tk 440.08 billion Thursday, which means it has increased by Tk 40 billion since early May. Power Grid Company of Bangladesh, BRAC Bank, Prime Bank, Southeast Bank, Square Pharma drove the market up, not only in terms of prices but also in terms of turnover. "Bank stocks have contributed to the rise. Higher capital bases of most banks and relatively higher prices of their shares have encouraged the index to rise," said Moin Al Kashem, a market analyst, said. "Institutional investors, especially banks and financial institutions, are investing in the market by extending loans to their clients under margin rule," Arif Khan, general manager of IDLC, has said recently. A margin loan facility extended by brokers and portfolio managersmainly banks and financial institutionsboosted turnover. Under the Margin Rules, brokers can sanction hundred percent of credit against their clients' investment. Portfolio managers are also extending loans. The ratio, in some cases, goes over five times the clients' actual investment. The DGEN closed at 2003, up 47.18 points or 2.41 percent Thursday. The DSI or all-share price index rallied 36.76 points or 2.26 percent to 1658.36. The DSE-20 blue chip index gained 50.95 points or 2.92 percent to 1794.67. "It's a result of a consistent gain in a few weeks. But investors should be aware of the ups and downs trend of a market," said Salahuddin Ahmed Khan, chief executive of DSE. Buying pressure pulled Square Pharma 6.48 percent up to Tk 3732.5. Square Pharma, the biggest drugs company by assets, finished as a top issue in turnover, recording Tk 236.13 million. Power Grid Company of Bangladesh fell 0.42 percent to Tk 590.75 due to profit taking. Expectations of good yields encouraged bank issues in turnover to gain. Southeast Bank ended at Tk 459.25, adding 2.28 percent. Prime Bank gained 1.95 percent to finish at Tk 832.5. EXIM Bank climbed 6.08 percent to Tk 413.75. Yawer Sayeed, chief of AIMS of Bangladesh, said the market has reached a reasonable level. "Investors, those are in a position to cash in profit, should make profit to help the market have a soft landing," he said. bd
