 BANGKOK, May 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least 2,000 anti-coup activists and supporters of ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra hit the streets of Bangkok on Thursday to protest the political banishment of his party and its leaders. They shouted slogans against coup leader General Sonthi Boonyaratglin and stopped public buses before they were pushed back by unarmed police near Government House. "Democracy Back, Thaksin Come Back," read one banner held by a protester wearing a "CNS Get Out" headband, referring to the name the coup leaders gave themselves, the Council for National Security. "Get out Sonthi," some activists shouted. The rally, the eighth since March organised by a satellite television station owned by Thaksin supporters, drew Thai Rak Thai backers upset by Wednesday's court ruling. "Although Thai Rak Thai has been banned, we still love Thaksin," Jatuporn Prompan, a rally organiser and former Thai Rak Thai spokesman, told the crowd from the stage. "The Constitutional Tribunal has ruled that Thai Rak Thai has committed a crime that was hostile to democracy. But who will make that ruling on the CNS which toppled a democratically elected government?," Jatuporn said. Earlier, Thaksin, living in London after he was ousted in a bloodless coup last September, issued a statement urging his supporters to accept the ruling by the court, which found his party guilty of breaking election laws in last year's inconclusive poll. The court absolved the rival Democrat Party, which had boycotted the poll later annulled by the courts, of any election wrongdoi
