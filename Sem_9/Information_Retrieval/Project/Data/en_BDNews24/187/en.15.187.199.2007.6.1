<TITLE> Canada to review Mohiuddin deportation case </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 OTTAWA, May 31 (bdnews24.com) Canadian immigration minister Diane Finley is not saying yet if Canada will offer asylum to Bangabandhu murder convict Mohiuddin Ahmed, who is facing deportation from the US and a death sentence back in Dhaka. The family of Mohiuddin took comfort from Finley's noncommittal answers in the Commons about his fate, Canadian daily Toronto Star reported Wednesday. Mohiuddin, sentenced in absentia for his role in the 1975 assassination of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman but who protests his innocence, ran up against a legal brick wall in his bid for asylum in the US last week. His hopes now rest on being granted asylum in Canada, where he has relatives and Liberal politicians taking up his case, as the Star reported. Liberal MP Irwin Cotler, who is also a human rights lawyer and is advising Mohiuddin, has written to Finley twice this week and asked in the Commons for her help. Finley would only say: "I can assure the member that Canada has one of the most welcoming and fair immigration systems in the world. Each case is reviewed, whether it is as a refugee immigrant or on a humanitarian basis. Each case is reviewed on its own merits and based on all the facts." Still, that was enough for Sabrina Ahmed, Mohiuddin's 30-year-old daughter, who is now in Ottawa to help plead her father's case. "I'm positive about the fact that she did not say a `no' to our question; no outright rejections and I'm thrilled about that," she said. At a news conference in Ottawa Wednesday, Sabrina said: "Please allow my father to come to your country." "You will be saving an innocent man's life," a news agency, Canadian Press, quoted her as saying. Mohiuddin's family and other supporters say he was nowhere near the scene when Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was murdered and say he is the victim of vengeful political enemies. The former army officer has been living in the United States since 1996, but his efforts to win asylum there have been fruitless. His daughter says he could be sent to Bangladesh by the end of the week. "There's virtually no time left," she said. Cotler said Canada should intervene and offer an alternative destination to Mohiuddin. Cotler said the man has family living in Nova Scotia and Toronto and Canada should step in because it opposes capital punishment. "Canada should not be a bystander in a situation where its intervention can save a life," he said. Cotler, too, said Mohiuddin is a victim of injustice. "He is in grave risk of being executed for a prior wrongful conviction in absentia." In Washington, Mohiuddin's son Rouben Ahmed, a 34-year-old Los Angeles architect, said his father is a "pawn" who's being persecuted by a government bent on revenge. "It's a nightmare," the son said. "My family has gone through hell. I'm very afraid. I don't want to lose my father. We can take care of him. He's not going to be a burden to the Canadian government. "We hope Canada does the right thing. They have in the past." He said affidavits from people familiar with the circumstances support his father's innocence, but will not be considered by the Bangladeshi courts, which have confirmed there is no chance to appeal the death sentence handed down in absentia. Rouben has seen his father several times since he was taken by US immigration authorities and speaks to him regularly by phone. "It's been tough. He's lost a lot of weight. He goes in and out. There are days he's strong." bdn
