 LISBON, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Many Portuguese workers stayed home on Wednesday in what unions hoped would be the first general strike against measures by the Socialist government to reduce the budget deficit by cutting workers' benefits. Lisbon's underground transport system and ferry boats that carry workers across the Tagus River to the capital were not operating and some workers at private companies failed to turn up to work, union representatives said. Unions hope public sector workers at health services, schools and government offices will shut down their facilities completely during the day. "We are against the policies the government is adopting, diminishing workers' rights," said Deolinda Machada, a member of the executive commission of the General Confederation of Portuguese Workers, the country's largest union. Union leaders said it was not clear what percentage of the workforce was on stike and this would only become apparent later in the day. Antonio Chora, a representative for the workers' commission at Volkswagen's Autoeuropa plant in Portugal, said about 15 percent of the factory's 2,700 workers had joined the strike. The factory represents about 8 percent of Portugal's exports. However, Paulo Campos, secretary of state for the public works ministry, told SIC television public services were "functioning within what could be expected on a day like today." In order to meet European Union budget deficit goals, the government has introduced far-reaching reforms, above all by reducing benefits for public sector workers. It has cut spending by reducing pensions, raising the retirement age and withdrawing civil service benefits such as freezing promotions. Unions say Wednesday's industrial action would be the first general strike in Portugal since 2002 although workers, mostly from the public sector, have held repeated protests against the government's reforms. The General Confederation of Portuguese Workers represents about 700,000 workers
