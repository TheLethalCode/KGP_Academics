 RAIPUR, India, June 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police shot dead four Maoist guerrillas in a gunbattle in the Chhattisgarh on Saturday, triggered by a raid on a rebel hideout, police said. A police official said several rebels had escaped into state's southern forests following the raid and a hunt was on. The Maoists started an armed movement in 1967 claiming to fight for the rights of poor peasants and landless labourers. The rebellion, which has killed thousands of people, has now spread to 13 states and Chhattisgarh is among the worst-hit. Official figures say the violence has killed at least 220 people, mostly policemen, in the first five months of this year in Chhattisgarh alone
