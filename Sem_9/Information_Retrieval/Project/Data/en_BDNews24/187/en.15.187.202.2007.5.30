 Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com) -- The World Bank has approved $200 million in a fourth installment of development support credit, a senior official with the Economic Relations Division said Wednesday. "I have been confirmed about the matter by the World Bank today (Wednesday). We'll sign an agreement in a few days," Shaheedul Haque, additional secretary of the ERD, told bdnews24.com. The approval came at a meeting of the WB board of executive directors meeting Tuesday, the multilateral lending agency said in a statement. According to the agreement, the WB was to have disbursed the fourth tranche of the DSC between July and December last year in budgetary support for the current fiscal year that ends on June 30. However, it delayed the release of the fund saying that Bangladesh would have to comply with all the terms and conditions agreed upon during the release of the third tranche. The WB board has now approved the installment considering reform efforts in Bangladesh, especially by the caretaker government. The main objective of the DSC is to address macroeconomic stability, trade liberalisation, better functioning of financial and power sectors, and reforms in core governance functions such as public financial management, the Anticorruption Commission and tax administration. "The DSC supports key aspects of the government's reform agenda aimed at strengthening prospects for stronger economic growth, improved governance, and faster poverty reduction in Bangladesh," said Xian Zhu, WB Country Director for Bangladesh. "The economic and social benefits associated with the reform programme supported by the DSC series are apparent. Poverty fell by 9 percent between 2000 and 2005, economic growth is at historically high levels, and most of the millennium development goals are on track," he added. Through the DSC credits, the WB has supported government reforms to increase competitive pressures on the Nationalised Commercial Banks (NCBs) and tighten prudential regulations and their enforcement. "Reforms have led to the percentage of non-performing loans of the banking sector falling from 25 percent in 2002 to 13 percent in 2007," the WB said. "One of the NCBs, Rupali Bank, is being divested to an international investor, while three other NCBs are being corporatised." DSC also supports trade liberalisation. Bangladesh has eliminated trade-related quantitative restrictions on imports, and reduced the average nominal rate of protection from 29 percent in fiscal year 2002 to 24 percent in fiscal year 2007. With the approval of DSC IV, the WB has provided $1.1 billion in policy-based credits since 2003, including $200 million credit in support of education sector reforms. The credit from the International Development Association, the WB's concessionary arm, has 40 years to maturity with a 10-year grace period. It carries a service charge of 0.75 percent. bd
