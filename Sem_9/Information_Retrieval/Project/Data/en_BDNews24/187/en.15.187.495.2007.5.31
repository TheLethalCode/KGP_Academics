<TITLE> Bank of Ireland says property slowdown 'good news' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 DUBLIN, May 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Slowing house price growth in Ireland is "really good news" and its impact on the Bank of Ireland has been "totally and utterly misrepresented," the bank's chief executive said on Thursday. "It was fundamentally unsustainable at both the rate of inflation we've seen for the past several years and the rate of growth in mortgage demand," Brian Goggin said of Ireland's once booming property market. Goggin told reporters that investors, worried by a recent cooling, had failed to take into account the bright outlook for Ireland's economy as a whole and its fast growing population. "What's happening in the housing market is very, very positive news from an overall economic perspective because it fundamentally underpins the soft-landing hypothesis that many of us have been talking about and the rest of the economy is flying," he added. Goggin said the slowdown had been misrepresented by commentators who were not telling a "rounded story" on the Irish economy, meaning some investors had misunderstood the likely impact on Bank of Ireland and its mortgage business. "Headlines grab attention, people are busy, how prepared are they to drill into the numbers?" he said. "If you go back in time it took external commentators many, many years to accept that the 'Celtic tiger' (economy) wasn't just a figment of somebody's imagination." Goggin said the bank's mortgage book had grown 22 percent in the 12 months to the end of March 2007. "Next year, ie the year to March 2008, we anticipate that it will grow by ... say 15, 16ish percent and it will sustain at that level for the medium term." Chief Financial Officer John O'Donovan said he had "no issue" in terms of the bank's asset quality. "Our mortgage book of 25 billion (euros) is as safe as houses if people hold their jobs and you don't have a significant spike in interest rates," he said. O'Donovan said the main reasons for slower earnings growth over the coming year would be factors such as the sale of broker Davy, the cost of investing in growth and a bigger proportion of earnings coming from the UK, where tax is higher. The bank was also coming out of what for Irish financial institutions had been "absolutely one of the sweetest spots that a bank could find itself", he added
