 LONDON, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British mortgage lender Kensington Plc said on Wednesday it had agreed to a takeover offer from South-African based investment bank Investec. Kensington said each shareholder would receive 0.7 Investec Plc shares and a special dividend of 26 pence from Kensington, equivalent to 519-1/2 pence per share based on Investec's London-listed share price on Tuesday. Shares in Investec were down 1.8 percent at 692p by 0713 GMT, valuing it at around 2.7 billion pounds ($5.4 billion). Kensington shares were flat at 490p, valuing it at around 257.7 million pounds. The new shares for Kensington shareholders will not qualify for the final dividend of 13p per share that Investec has proposed for the year to Mar 31, it said in a statement. Kensington said in a trading update issued on Wednesday that the first five months to Apr. 30 had been challenging and it expects 2007 revenue to be significantly below 2006. The company hopes the Investec deal will give it access to funds allowing it to grow. It has struggled to raise money at the same cost as its peers, Kensington said. Investec believes the deal will broaden its revenue base and it can give Kensington the funds, and access to capital markets, necessary for it to grow, its chief executive said. Investec said the acquisition would be earnings enhancing before synergies in the first full year after completion. "Kensington does not need a working capital injection in the short-term but it does in the long-term to grow," said Investec Chief Executive Stephen Koseff in a conference call. "We believe this is an attractive franchise play -- though Kensington have been under a fair amount of pressure we are pretty familiar with what is in their trading update and the price of the transaction took that fully into account," he said. Koseff said the integration of Kensington's 300 staff would be relatively simple and its senior management would stay in place, though the firm would de-list. He expects some job cuts but could not say where or how many
