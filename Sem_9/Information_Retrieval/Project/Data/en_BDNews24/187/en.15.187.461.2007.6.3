 Dhaka, June 3 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Sunday sent Awami League general secretary Abdul Jalil to jail, six days after he was arrested on allegations of breaching emergency rules. The same court sent former state minister for home and BNP leader Lutfozzaman Babar into a fresh four-day remand for questioning in an arms case, filed by sub-inspector Helaluddin of Gulshan Police Station Sunday. Sub-inspector Kabir Ahmed of the same police station appealed to the court for a seven-day remand for Babar but the court approved four days. AL presidium member Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim and Partex Group chairman MA Hashem were also sent to jail. Magistrate Abdur Rouf Khan issued the order on Jalil and magistrate Shafiq Anwar on others. According to a police report, Jalil stands accused of holding a secret meeting to sabotage state security. In the report, police alleged that Jalil supplied arms and funds to party activists. The police had appealed for detention of Jalil, a key player in AL chief Sheikh Hasina's ranks.
