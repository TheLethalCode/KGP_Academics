 JAKARTA/CANBERRA, May 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A diplomatic row between Indonesia and Australia appeared to cool on Thursday after the governor of Jakarta was reported to have forgiven Australia for what he had described as insulting treatment by Sydney police. Indonesia had lodged a formal diplomatic protest after the governor, ex-general Sutiyoso, was served with a New South Wales state police summons to attend a coroner's inquest into the 1975 deaths of five journalists in East Timor. Sutiyoso was quoted as saying Australia's ambassador to Indonesia, Bill Farmer, had expressed regret and promised to get a letter of apology from the NSW leader. "We are a big-hearted nation. We have to forgive," Sutiyoso was quoted as saying by online news service Detik.com. "Let's not make illogical demands. What's more, the Australian side has apologised and will work on an official apology," he added. Officials at his office could not immediately be reached to confirm the comments. Later on Thursday, Australian Associated Press reported NSW Premier Morris Iemma had written to Sutiyoso to apologise for any distress and inconvenience caused during his stay in Sydney. Iemma said the police action had not been sanctioned by the government and he was disappointed the governor's visit had been cut short. "The circumstances which led to the entry to your room will be thoroughly investigated," he wrote. Sutiyoso, who was in Sydney at the invitation of the state government, said two officers had barged into his hotel room on Tuesday while he was sleeping and had asked him to sign an invitation to testify in the inquest. Australian Prime Minister John Howard downplayed the row. "The relationship with Indonesia is very strong, it's very robust and it's very close. That does not alter the fact that this matter does need to be explained," he told reporters. About 50 demonstrators protested outside the Australian embassy in Jakarta on Thursday over the perceived snub, fewer than the several hundred a day earlier. Sutiyoso, who served as a captain in East Timor at the start of Indonesian occupation of the territory, said he was angry at his treatment and denied he had anything to do with the deaths of the journalists. The Sydney inquest into the death of the five Australia-based journalists heard they were deliberately gunned down by Indonesian soldiers. In final submissions to the inquest, Mark Tedeschi, the counsel assisting the coroner, said the journalists were killed in Balibo in East Timor to stop them reporting news of Indonesian military actions. Official Indonesian reports have blamed the deaths on Oct 16, 1975 on crossfire, as Indonesian forces entered East Timor in an incursion ahead of a full-scale invasion of the territory in December of the same year. Indonesia's Foreign Ministry has warned any adverse findings from the inquiry will be ignored and will only serve to damage the fragile bilateral relationship
