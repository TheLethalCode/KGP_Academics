<TEXT>
 LONDON, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A British soldier killed in Afghanistan had survived service in Iraq and was engaged to be married, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said on Wednesday. It paid tribute to the dead soldier, 31-year-old Corporal Darren Bonner of the 1st battalion of the Royal Anglian Regiment. The soldier, affectionately known as "Big Daz", died when an explosion hit a convoy in which he was travelling in the Gereshk region of Helmand province, southern Afghanistan, on Monday. Cpl Bonner -- the lead signaller with A (Norfolk) Company -- was engaged and looking forward to the prospect of marriage and buying a home in Great Yarmouth after his tour of duty in Afghanistan, the MoD said in a statement. Britain sent thousands of troops to Helmand province in southern Afghanistan a year ago with an expanding NATO peacekeeping force. Almost 600 foreign military personnel -- 10 percent of them Britons -- have died in Afghanistan since the Taliban government was toppled in 2001
