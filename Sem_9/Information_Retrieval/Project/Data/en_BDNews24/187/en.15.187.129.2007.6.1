 LONDON, June 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe should not return to the test arena until it shows it can perform at the required standard, an International Cricket Council committee said on Thursday. The Zimbabwe government withdrew the African country from test cricket last year although they still take part in one-day internationals and played in this year's World Cup in the Caribbean. "The committee did not support the return of Zimbabwe to test cricket until such time as the team demonstrates its ability to perform at a standard that does not risk undermining the integrity of test cricket," an ICC statement said. The ICC chief executives' committee will consider the recommendations of the committee, chaired by former India captain Sunil Gavaskar and containing several other distinguished former players. This month the Australian government ordered the world champions to cancel a planned tour of Zimbabwe in protest against the policies of President Robert Mugabe
