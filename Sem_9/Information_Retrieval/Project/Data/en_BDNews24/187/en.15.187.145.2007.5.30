 BEIJING, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese police have detained 32 potential illegal immigrants at a city bordering North Korea who were trying to get to South Korea, Xinhua news agency said on Wednesday. The 32 were from China's northeastern province of Heilongjiang and were detained along with two "snakeheads" -- the Chinese term for people smuggler -- at Dandong on Tuesday, the report said. "Recently there was a group of stowaways from Heilongjiang who were biding their time in Dandong preparing to sneak into South Korea," it quoted an unnamed police official as saying. There were 27 men and seven women, aged between 21 and 48, Xinhua added. It did not say how they were planning to get to South Korea, whose only land border is a heavily fortified frontier with North Korea, but added the investigation was continuing. Chinese people have a long history of leaving poverty, war and famine in their homeland to search for a better life overseas. Traditionally they came from southern coastal provinces and went mainly to Southeast Asia, though significant numbers also ended up in Europe, North America, Australia and Africa. South Korea and Japan are now also popular choices, especially for those from China's rustbelt northeastern provinces. But the government is trying to crack down on illegal immigration following the 2004 drownings of 21 Chinese as they gathered shellfish off the coast of northwest England
