<TITLE> Policymakers unaware of unemployment status: CPD </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 02 (bdnews24.com)  Independent think-tank the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) Saturday said government policymakers do not appear aware of the unemployment status in the country as there is no data available. "We did not get anything on unemployment. Decision makers of the country are completely in the dark about the unemployment situation," Dr Debapriya Bhattacharya, executive director of CPD, told journalists at a briefing at CIRDAP. "Even the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics has no data on the unemployment situation in the country." He made the remark while presenting the state of economy for the outgoing fiscal and an outlook for the upcoming fiscal. The CPD said unemployment increased recently due to the large-scale eviction drive and anticorruption drive. Economists and experts said the drives have dealt a blow to the informal economy that makes almost half the GDP. The CPD executive director criticised the interim government for over-estimated projection of GDP growth for the current fiscal at 6.51 percent. "We think the GDP growth would really be around 6 percent. It could not be 6.5 percent due to significant fall in agriculture, poultry and construction sectors," Bhattacharya said. The CPD in its outlook said the government would face a major challenge to spiral back the hiking prices of essentials in the upcoming 2007-08 fiscal. The other challenges would be addressing growing inequality, boosting investment and domestic savings, expanding tax base, improving quality of ADP implementation and removing infrastructure constraints. The government would also have to sustain export growth and press on with its structural reforms. The CPD said relentless price hike of essentials had been the main challenge for the government in the outgoing 2006-07. Poor revenue collection, higher revenue expenditure, low disbursement of foreign aid, fertiliser and power crisis, and stagnant food grain production also blighted the economy. The CPD said no decision on Tata and Asia Energy investment proposals has weakened the investment prospects. bdnew
