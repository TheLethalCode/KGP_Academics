 BEIJING, June 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rights groups and dissidents called on China on Saturday to lift a ban on reporting about the 1989 Tiananmen Square movement and stop persecuting those involved, days before the sensitive anniversary of the crackdown. China insists the military suppression of the student-led protests was necessary to put down a "counter-revolutionary rebellion", and the government stifles any calls to reassess the incident, in which rights groups say hundreds died. But Amnesty International, in a statement ahead of the June 4 anniversary, said an honest reckoning was necessary. "Global experience shows that long-term stability is best ensured by addressing injustices of the past," the group said. "As the 18th anniversary of the crackdown approaches, Amnesty International urges the Chinese authorities to ensure greater respect for freedom of expression and information by lifting the official ban on reporting about the tragic events of June 4 1989." Bao Tong was a top aide to then party chief Zhao Ziyang, ousted for his opposition to sending in the troops. Bao said China's failure to deal with the incident was blocking any movement toward reform. "Admitting that suppressing the people was a crime is the only possible way to realise constitutional government, allowing China to have long-term peace and good government on the basis of democracy," Bao said in a statement. New York-based Human Rights Watch said the government's failure to account for its handling of the demonstrations was spawning further abuses and casting a shadow over Beijing's hosting of the 2008 Olympics. "What kind of Olympic host marks the annual anniversary of a brutal massacre by persecuting victims' families and detaining dissidents," Sophie Richardson, the group's deputy Asia director, said in a statement. Survivors and victims' families are routinely harassed in the lead-up to the anniversary, with phones blocked, activities monitored and some being placed under house arrest. Bao, who has become an outspoken critic of China's human rights abuses since he was freed in 1996 after seven years in prison, said that even though ultimate responsibility for June 1989 lay with late leader Deng Xiaoping, current leaders still had an obligation to provide answers. "Deng Xiaoping is already dead. But the common people at least have the right to hear just words," Bao wrote in the statement released through his son, who lives in Hong Kong. "The present leaders, even if they lack the power to deal with the aftermath, should at least speak honestly and responsibly."
