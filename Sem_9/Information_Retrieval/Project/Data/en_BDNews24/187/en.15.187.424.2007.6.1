 Jessore, June 1 (bdnews24.com)  Unidentified criminals stabbed a businessman to death in Narayanpur in Jessore Friday, police said. The victim, Mostafa Kamal, was also the editor of the local weekly "Haq Protibad." Kotwali police chief MA Matin said that the miscreants killed Mostafa Kamal in his own fish and cattle farm sprawling over 170 bighas of land in Narayanpur near the district headquarters. Mostafa Kamal had received President and Prime Minister awards for his outstanding successes in farming and exporting fish. Kamal's relative advocate Akter Kamal told bdnews24.com that a vested quarter that had earlier threatened to kill him (Kamal) was responsible for the murder. Mahidul Islam Mantu, acting editor of the Haq Protibad, said that the incident was not linked to any report carried by the paper. "He might have been killed over matters related to his business, not journalism," Mantu said. bdnews2
