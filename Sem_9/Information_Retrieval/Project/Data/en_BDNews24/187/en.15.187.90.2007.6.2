<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, June 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thai Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont said on Saturday his government had no plan to propose early amnesties for ousted Premier Thaksin Shinawatra and his party leaders after they were banned from politics. Surayud's remarks, made on a TV programme scheduled to be aired later on Saturday, were in contrast with coup leader General Sonthi Boonyaratglin who said he supported the idea of giving amnesties to the exiled leader and his supporters. "The government will try to find the best solution, but I would like to say that we will not do it at this time," the army-appointed prime minister said. On Wednesday, the Constitutional Tribunal banned Thaksin from politics for five years and disbanded his Thai Rak Thai (Thais love Thais) party. Army chief Sonthi had told state-run Channel 11 television on Friday any amnesty bill would have to be initiated by Surayud and sent to parliament appointed by the military after the coup last September. "For the sake of national reconciliation, I support the idea of giving them amnesty," the general said. "The CNS as a whole agrees with the idea," he said, referring to the Council for National Security, as the coup leaders call themselves. On Thursday at least 2,000 Thaksin supporters and anti-coup activists shouted slogans against Sonthi and stopped public buses before they were pushed back by unarmed police near Government House. Thaksin's supporters were scheduled to hold another major rally in Bangkok on Saturday against the verdict of the tribunal, which left the opposition Democrat party intact. Surayud said the army chief's amnesty remarks were his personal opinion. He said politicians and ordinary Thais should take time studying the tribunal's views on the Thaksin case before considering the amnesty issue. "Everyone should take this period to clearly study the wording of its rulings, and only after that should we look at whether the amnesty is appropriate," he said. Although Thaksin said from his exile in London he accepted the verdicts and appealed to his supporters to remain calm, there are many flashpoints ahead. A referendum on a new draft constitution, widely criticised as aimed at reducing the power of politicians in favour of bureaucrats, is scheduled for September and a general election for December. Thaksin may also face trial on charges of corruption, one of the justifications Sonthi gave for the September coup
