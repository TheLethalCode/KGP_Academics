 Dhaka, May 31 (bdnews24.com) -- The World Bank Thursday approved a fund of $15 million to Bangladesh, designed to support the rickshawpullers who have been adversely affected by a ban on non-motorised transport on certain roads in Dhaka. The additional financing to the Second Poverty Alleviation Microfinance Project, which was approved by the World Bank in Jan 2001, will help the urban micro-credit component of the project reach an underserved segment of the urban poor"poor rickshaw-pullers". The fund will be passed by the government as a grant to the apex microfinance institution, Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation, the multilateral lending agency said in a statement. "This additional financing builds on a highly successful project. It has reached 3.5 million borrowers, including some 335,000 urban poor," said Shamsuddin Ahmad, World Bank senior financial sector specialist and project team leader. "With the help of the microfinance services offered to the rickshawpullers affected by the non-motorised transport ban, it is expected that they and their families would be able to restore their livelihoods." The WB expected that about 40,500 rickshaw owners, their family members and those pullers that would like to give up rickshaw-pulling for a new career will be provided with micro-credit and other services. bd
