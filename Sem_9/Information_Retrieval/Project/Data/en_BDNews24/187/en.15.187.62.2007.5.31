<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 31 (bdnews24.com) - Title contenders Muktijoddha Sangsad took a sweet revenge of their first-leg one-goal loss to Chittagong Mohammedan SC when the All-Red outfit handed a 2-1 defeat to the black and white outfit in the second leg opener of the B. League at the Bangabandhu National Stadium Thursday. The sixth triumph in the league put Muktijoddha Sangsad on the top of point table with 21 points from 11 matches, one point ahead of Dhaka Mohammedan Sporting Club, who played one match less than Muktijoddha Sangsad. Chittagong Mohammedan, on the other hand, remained on 17 points to stay in fourth position playing as many matches. The hosts, Muktijoddha, enjoyed a superior ball possession in the first and went ahead in the 12th minute as veteran striker Alfaz Ahmed struck with a gentle touch after capitalising a left-side cross from Firoj Mahmud Titu. Stopper Parvez Babu doubled the margin for the freedom fighters' team in the 25th minute as Parvez converted a rebounder inside the box after an Enamul Haq strike came back, hitting a fellow Mohammedan defender. After the breather, visitors Mohammedan regrouped to press hard and reduced a goal, but they had to remain satisfied with a lone goal. Muktijoddha defender Din Mohammad brought their striker Mololu down in the danger zone and the referee did not hesitate to award Mohammedan a penalty in the 13th minute. Asif converted the penalty to reduce Mohammedan margin 2-1. Muktijoddha Sangsad could have left the field with a big margin had striker Alfaz, one of three hat-trick men of the first leg, not squandered two easy sitters in the dying minutes.
