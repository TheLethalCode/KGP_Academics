<TITLE> Beckham makes stylish England comeback </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, June 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former captain David Beckham marked his England return with a stylish performance in a 1-1 friendly draw with Brazil on Friday, earning a standing ovation from an 88,000 crowd at the new Wembley Stadium. The midfielder, dropped when Steve McClaren replaced Sven-Goran Eriksson as coach after last year's World Cup finals in Germany, played a part in most of England's attacking moves including the goal. Beckham's accurate free-kick from the right after 68 minutes was powerfully headed home by John Terry, his successor as skipper. It was a fitting combination for England's opening goal in their first international at Wembley for nearly seven years. The 32-year-old Beckham, who last played for his country in the World Cup quarter-final defeat by Portugal last July, won his 95th cap on Friday and now looks certain to face Estonia in Wednesday's Euro 2008 qualifier. "Many people questioned the decision but since the New Year his performances for Real Madrid have been outstanding," said McClaren. "He has been fit and strong and deserved his place in the team. It was fitting Beckham and JT (Terry) combined for the goal," the coach told reporters. Asked whether he would like Beckham to commute from California and carry on playing for England after he moves to Los Angeles Galaxy next month, McClaren replied: "We are only focused on Wednesday's match, nothing further than that". Beckham played like he had never been away. He produced long raking passes, made intelligent use of space and was accurate on the ball. "David was different class today, his delivery superb," said Terry. "It was a great ball from Becks and it was about time I scored again.
