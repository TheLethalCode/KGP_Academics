<TITLE> Gilchrist may phase out one-dayers to extend test career </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SYDNEY, June 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia vice captain Adam Gilchrist says he is considering quitting one-day cricket to prolong his test career. Gilchrist plans to keep playing one-day cricket in the short term but said he would eventually stick to tests only, following the example of his recently retired team mate Shane Warne. "Up until the last 12 months, I had never been a guy to consider phasing out one form of the game and just focusing on one," Gilchrist told the Sydney Morning Herald. "But I am open to thinking about that now. I have been quite firm on playing both forms in the past, but I guess that things have changed a little." Gilchrist said that while his desire to play was still strong, the retirements of several of his team mates over the last year had made him take stock. "When a few of the guys started retiring last year, it made me stop and reflect on where I was at personally," he said. "And while the appetite is still very strong to keep playing, I've just noticed the hunger and the drive for test cricket that guys like Warney and Justin Langer had when they didn't have one-day cricket to consider." Gilchrist, 35, has been a key member of the Australian one-day team for a decade and is one of three players along with Ricky Ponting and Glenn McGrath to have played in three World Cup winning teams. The wicketkeeper batsman was named man of the match in this year's World Cup final victory over Sri Lanka after smashing a century that swung the match Australia's way. But he said the recent birth of his third child had caused him to reasses his priorities. "There is a lot of cricket coming up over the next three years, so there are things to consider," he said. "That's not to say that I am announcing right now that I am retiring from one-day cricket, but it's just that I am more open-minded about the issue these days.
