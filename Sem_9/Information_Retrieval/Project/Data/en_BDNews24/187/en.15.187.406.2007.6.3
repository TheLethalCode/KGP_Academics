 NAHR AL-BARED, Lebanon (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Lebanese troops, backed by artillery, tanks and gunships, tightened their grip on al Qaeda-inspired militants at a Palestinian refugee camp on Sunday, the third day of a military assault to crush the gunmen. Security sources said Fatah al-Islam militants, who have vowed to fight to the death, were putting up stiff resistance as soldiers pounded Nahr al-Bared camp and consolidated its newly seized positions at its entrances. Explosions rocked the camp as the crackle of machinegun fire echoed in the early hours of the morning on Sunday. Plumes of smoke rose from the camp as shelling set buildings on fire. But the fighting appeared to be of a lesser intensity than over the past two days, witnesses said. The shelling since Friday have devastated large parts of the camp, bringing down buildings used by the gunmen to fire at the troops but also destroying many civilian homes. "There is no square meter that has not been hit by a shell," one camp resident told Reuters by telephone. "We can't leave the building we are in, let alone the street, to find out the full extent of the devastation." Most of Nahr al-Bared's nearly 40,000 population had fled to other refugee camps in the past two weeks due to increasingly desperate humanitarian conditions. At least six soldiers have been killed in the fighting since Friday, while more than 16 people -- militants and civilians -- have died in the camp. Fatah al-Islam said it has lost three fighters. In what was seen as a direct threat against U.N. peacekeepers in south Lebanon, the militants' spokesman, Abu Salim Taha, told Reuters on Saturday night that a UNIFIL naval force joined the fighting, hitting a civilian shelter and inflicting casualties. A UNIFIL spokeswoman denied the peacekeepers played any role in the fighting and said the claim was "utterly unfounded". The fighting, which erupted on May 20, is Lebanon's worst internal violence since the 1975-1990 civil war. The government says militants triggered the siege by attacking army positions around the camp and Lebanon's second largest city, Tripoli. Lebanon's anti-Syrian cabinet says Fatah al-Islam is a Syrian tool, but Damascus denies any links to the group and says its leader, Shaker al-Abssi, is on Syria's wanted list. Abssi and his comrades say they are inspired by al Qaeda's ideology. Lebanon has been split by a deep seven-month-old political crisis over the opposition's demands for more say in government. The opposition includes Syria's allies, led by Hezbollah. The army began its push towards the camp on Friday with the aim of killing the militants or forcing them to surrender. Fatal al-Islam has vowed not to surrender or lay down its arms, saying it was ready to fight for a long time. Prime Minister Fouad Siniora said the militants have no choice but to surrender and give up their arms. "What they have committed against the Lebanese army and the Lebanese state, makes it impossible to find agreement, or accord or attempt at a truce or compromise," Siniora told Dubai-based Al Arabiya television in an interview on Saturday. The death toll in the two-week-old conflict stood at 106, of whom 41 are soldiers, and at least 34 are militants and 20 are civilians. While the army has not entered the camp's official boundaries, it has seized on the militants' positions on Nahr al-Bared's outskirts, confining them to about a third of the camp. A 1969 Arab agreement prevents the army from entering Lebanon's 12 Palestinian camps, home to 400,000 refuge
