 Dhaka, May 31 (bdnews24.com)  A heat wave that swept through the country worsened Thursday, as the highest temperature was recorded at 40.4 degrees Celsius in Bogra. Sweltering heat and frequent power cuts disrupted normal life in the city. The meteorological department said the heat wave spread to more areas of the country. A strong heat wave sweeps through Ishwardi and its neighbouring areas and a moderate heat wave prevails in Bogra, Syedpur, Dinajpur, Pabna, Sirajganj and parts of Rajshahi division. Dhanmondi is one of the worst-hit areas in the capital. A long spell of outage has slowed news updates on the bdnews24.com website. A mild heat wave has hit parts of Barisal and Khulna divisions. Severe power cuts added to the sufferings of people. An official of the Power Development Board Thursday said there were 1131 megawatts load-shedding in the country on May 30 when power plants had the capacity to generate 3113 megawatts electricity. Thursday's possible load shedding has been put on 1062 megawatts. The PDB expects 3293 megawatts to be generated in peak hours Thursday, the official said on condition of anonymity. Weather forecasters said the capital city of Dhaka Thursday recorded 37.1 degrees Celsius, which is 4.8 degrees Celsius above the normal temperature. Much of the country recorded 1 to 7 degrees Celsius above normal temperatures for summer. Jessore recorded 38.4 degrees Celsius, Syedpur 39.6 degrees Celsius, Rajshahi 40.2 degrees Celsius, Tangail 37.8 degrees Celsius, Chuadanga 39.1 degrees Celsius, Satkhira 38.4 degrees Celsius, Khulna 38 degrees Celsius, Patuakhali 36.6 degrees Celsius and Mongla baked in 39 degrees Celsius. There may be relief from the heat over a few days, as weathercasters expect monsoon winds that would help fall temperatures. Meteorologist Sadequl Alam told bdnews24.com that temperatures would fall once the monsoon wind begins. He said the monsoon wind usually reaches Teknaf coast towards the end of May. The weather remains unusual until the wind reaches the coast. Sadequl Islam said there might be sporadic rain in the country but there is no chance that temperature will fall for the time being. bdnews
