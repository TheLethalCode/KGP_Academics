<TITLE> Dow Jones must take Murdoch promise on faith </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, June 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A crucial factor in whether the Bancroft family decides to sell Dow Jones & Co Inc to Rupert Murdoch is his commitment to preserving the company's reputation for editorial independence. But even if the News Corp chief sets up an independent editorial board or agrees to any other measures, journalism experts said the problem the Bancrofts face is they would have no compelling way to bind him to his promises. "He may abide by some understandings for a period of time, but the essential point will be that he will own The Wall Street Journal," said Alex S Jones, director of the Joan Shorenstein Centre on the Press, Politics & Public Policy at Harvard University. Jones said it would be "crazy" to think that Murdoch would buy Dow Jones for $5 billion and leave the Journal, its star media property, unchanged. He described the family's insistence on Murdoch maintaining editorial independence for Dow Jones as a "fig leaf" to cover a decision he described as fundamentally financial. Murdoch is offering $60 a share for Dow Jones, a 65 percent premium to its trading price before the bid was disclosed a month ago. With no other bids in sight, the Bancrofts are under tremendous pressure from other shareholders to sell. History shows that publishers who treat editorial independence as paramount cannot always insist on it in the face of generous offers, said Geneva Overholser, a professor at the Missouri School of Journalism's Washington bureau and former editor at the Des Moines Register. "It seems that the family always has the first reaction that we hope they'd have, which is: 'No, this is our legacy, this company means too much to us, it's not for sale'," she said. "But depending on how badly somebody wants it... I think the centre just very rarely can hold." The Bancrofts said late on Thursday they would consider News Corp's bid, as well as other offers. Some experts said the only way for the family to preserve what it thinks the Journal should be is for it to find a like-minded buyer. "History would suggest that people who want a certain kind of environment to exist after they sell something should find a buyer whom they think reflects those principals," said Tom Rosenstiel, director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism in Washington, DC. Selling to News Corp troubles some Journal newsroom staff, who are not convinced that Murdoch's offer to set up a board, which would handle editorial decisions separately from business, would help. "I don't think there is anything he can say that will take away the danger down the road that he is going to ravage the brand name," said Steve Yount, president of the union that represents Dow Jones employees. But others say it is in Murdoch's financial, if not journalistic interest to maintain the Journal's reputation. "He would be scared to be perceived as interfering in the editorial product because that would undermine his investment something awful," said Philip Meyer, University of North Carolina professor and author of "The Vanishing Newspaper." "Fox News is right-wing not because Murdoch is a right-wing nut. He realises that the niche audience is key to success in media ... I think it was a sound business decision. He might keep The Wall Street Journal on the same independent course because that's a sound business decision.
