 GAZA, June 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh demanded the release of kidnapped BBC Gaza correspondent Alan Johnston after his abductors released a video of the journalist on Friday. "We are renewing our demands of the men, the abductors of the British journalist, to protect him and not to harm his life and to immediately release the journalist," Haniyeh said after Friday prayers in Gaza City. "This is an action that does not serve Islam, does not serve the Palestinian cause, and does not serve those who have abducted him."
