 JAIPUR, India, June 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Violent protests by ethnic Gujjars demanding special government treatment spread to the fringe of the capital New Delhi on Friday, as the death toll from four days of trouble rose to 18. Tens of thousands of bus and train passengers as well as truck drivers have been stranded for days on highways or at railway stations in the western state of Rajasthan, a popular destination for foreign tourists. Gujjars, a community traditionally known for being shepherds and agriculturalists, took their protests to New Delhi attacking police vehicles and throwing stones. Millions of Gujjars, who are spread across a large swathe of north and western India, want to be declared a Scheduled Tribe (ST) which entitles them to government affirmative action programmes. In the past two decades, more castes and communities under Hinduism's traditional caste system have been demanding they be marked downwards in the caste hierarchy in order to garner government jobs and college seats on affirmative action programmes. "The strident demand among Gujjars in Rajasthan for ST status is a reflection of the seeming paradox of the notion of caste in today's India," the Times of India said in an editorial. "The advent of reservations as an instrument to address economic and social inequities ... has promoted communities to go down the caste ladder to take advantages of assured quotas." In Rajasthan, a state of some 57 million and famous for the Thar desert, Gujjar protesters attacked government property in several districts, forcing authorities to put a shoot-at-sight order in Bayana town on Friday in the east of the state. Two rounds of talks between Gujjar representatives and state government officials this week have failed and a third round is planned later on Friday. "We will not lift our blockade unless we get reservation," a Gujjar protester, holding a big stick, told NDTV television, while he and other Gujjars blocked a major highway in Rajasthan. Media reports said tensions were rising between the Gujjars and the Meenas, a powerful community in Rajasthan. The Meenas have cornered a large slice of the existing tribal quota for government jobs and college seats in the state, and their representatives say they do not want the Gujjars to get reserved seats at their cost, and plan protests. In 1990, dozens of upper-caste Hindu students burnt themselves to death to protest against a government plan to widen the quota for lower castes in government jobs
