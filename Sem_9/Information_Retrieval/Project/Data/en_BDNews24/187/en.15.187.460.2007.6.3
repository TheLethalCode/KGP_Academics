<TITLE> Corruption cuts make a realistic goal: ACC boss </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 3 (bdnews24.com) -- Anticorruption Commission chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury Sunday said an idealistic goal was to make Bangladesh corruption-free. "But the realistic goal is to cut corruption to a limited scale to establish good governance," the ACC boss said in his address to the inauguration of a training programme on "Investigative journalism on prevention of corruption and governance". The programme was held at the National Institute of Mass Communication (NIMCO) under supervision of UNDP. "If Denmark can achieve a fourth place as a corruption-free country Bangladesh will someday surely secure a third position," Chowdhury said. "Only publishing lists of corrupt people won't bring benefit unless proper actions are taken against them. At the moment, our job is to take action against high-profile corrupt people." Chowdhury referred to British-era Official Secrets Act and said: "This law is an impediment to journalism. But it didn't bring our journalism to a halt. Two are working in parallel." Danish ambassador to Bangladesh Einar H Jensen, UN resident coordinator in Bangladesh Renata Lok Dessallien and NIMCO director general Syed Mahbubur Rahman were also present at the launch of the month-long training programme. bdnew
