 Dhaka, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com) -- Four Awami League presidium members rushed a meeting Wednesday to discuss the next course to dialogue with the government, hours after the High Court annulled an extortion case against party president Sheikh Hasina. One of the AL leaders who attended the meeting told bdnews24.com that it was one of the most "crucial meetings in the history of the party". None of the participants, except for AL presidium member Amir Hossain Amu, would reveal details about the outcome of the meeting that continued for two and a half hours from 5pm at acting AL president Zillur Rahman's home. "We have discussed the probability of dialogue with the caretaker government. We will sit with our allies to make a clear roadmap for dialogue," Amu told bdnews24.com by phone. The leader added that the AL would hold talks with 14-party allies on Feb 10. The three other presidium members are Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed and Suranjit Sengupta. Two other leaders who were also present at the meeting are the party's acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam and commerce and industry secretary Faruk Khan. bdne
