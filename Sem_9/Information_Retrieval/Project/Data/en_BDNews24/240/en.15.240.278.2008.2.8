 ISLAMABAD, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan on Friday launched a welfare scheme to provide millions of poor people with ration cards to buy food at subsidised rates from government stores. The move came 10 days ahead of a general election and amid mounting pressure on the government over rising inflation and hardship caused by power and gas shortages in recent weeks. "It is the obligation of the State to help those who do not have enough means," said President Pervez Musharraf, while launching a scheme at a government store in Islamabad. "We will ensure that everyone is able to get food at affordable rates," he was quoted as saying by the official Associated Press of Pakistan. The scheme has been launched in Islamabad but will ultimately benefit about 6.8 million household across the country by providing food items including flour, sugar, rice, ghee and cooking oil at almost 40 percent below the market price. The decision to issue ration cards came after sharp price increases in wheat, flour and edible oils, central components of the Pakistani diet. Officials blamed hoarders and smugglers for shortages of wheat and flour. (Reporting by Augustine Anthony; Editing by Simon-Cameron Moore)
