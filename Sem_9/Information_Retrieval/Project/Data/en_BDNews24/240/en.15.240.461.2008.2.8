 LONDON, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British waste collection company Biffa Plc agreed to a 1.2 billion pound ($2.34 billion) takeover from a consortium of private equity companies but its shares rose above the offer price on hopes of a counterbid. Biffa said on Friday a third party was looking at its books and might improve on the 350 pence per share it had accepted from Montagu Funds, Global Infrastructure Partners and UCIL. Biffa shares were up 10.7 percent at 363 pence by 0820 GMT, while rival Shanks Group Plc was up 4.6 percent. Seymour Pierce analyst Kevin Lapwood said the offer valued Biffa at 23.5 times his forecast for 2008 earnings per share. That "may appear generous, but we still maintain, it is not enough. There are still several infrastructure investors that would pay more and we still believe that a price closer to 400 pence is more realistic," Lapwood said. On Jan. 24, Biffa said it was prepared to recommend a 350 pence proposal from Montagu and Global Infrastructure Partners if the private equity companies made a firm offer at that price. At the time, Biffa also said HgCapital, which with Montagu had made a failed approach at 330 pence last autumn, had withdrawn from the bidding consortium to be replaced by U.S. conglomerate General Electric's Global Infrastructure Partners. Biffa, which was demerged from British water company Severn Trent Plc in October 2006, said the third party had approached it after that Jan. 24 announcement. Biffa also said it had continued to make good progress, and its profit would be weighted towards resource recovery and landfill and power generation rather than collection as in 2006/07. Montagu's Jason Gatenby said Biffa was "a market leading business with a great workforce in a sector we understand well and where we have a demonstrable track record of success". Biffa non-executive chairman Bob Davies said the buyers' "investment plans will help Biffa maximise the opportunities presented by changing legislation to deliver growth into the medium term". Biffa has hired Tricorn for advice alongside Citi and JPMorgan Cazenove, who are both also advising the unnamed third par
