<TITLE> Force of blast killed Benazir, not bullet: report </TITLE>

 WASHINGTON, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani opposition leader Benazir Bhutto was killed by the force of a suicide bomb and not by an assassin's bullet, The New York Times reported in its Friday editions, quoting officials briefed by Scotland Yard investigators. Benazir died on December 27 while campaigning in Rawalpindi. Controversy rages in Pakistan over whether the popular politician was struck down by a bullet or by a concussive injury caused by the bomb detonated after an assassin shot at her from close range. President Pervez Musharraf asked Britain's Scotland Yard to help in the investigation. A poll conducted by Gallup Pakistan found almost half of all Pakistanis believed government agencies or politicians allied to Musharraf were involved in the assassination. The report, which will be presented to the Pakistani government and Benazir's family on Friday, said Benazir died after the suicide blast detonated and she hit her head, the Times said. The newspaper also said the inquiry determined a single gunman caused the explosion. Government officials in Pakistan initially said there were two assailants, according to The Times. Investigators shared the findings with Musharraf's government on Thursday, the newspaper said, quoting officials who requested anonymity. After the assassination, government officials asserted that Benazir died after striking her head, but many Pakistanis did not accept that explanation. The Times said it was unclear how Scotland Yard reached its conclusions. Benazir was buried without an autopsy and the crime scene was cleaned immediately after the blast, potentially washing away vital clues. The report comes less than two weeks before Pakistan's parliamentary elections on February 18, which were delayed by Benazir's slaying. As thousands gathered to mark the end of a 40-day mourning period for Benazir, Pakistani authorities announced two "important arrests" in connection with her assassination. A senior police officer in Rawalpindi identified the suspects as Hasnain and Rifaqat, but gave no other details. Two others, including a 15-year-old who admitted being a backup suicide bomber, were arrested last month.
