 Dhaka, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com)The SEC sees stock market capitalisation and turnover double in 2008, the head of the regulatory commission said Thursday. Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Faruq Ahmad Siddiqi was optimistic about more government entities and telecoms debuting on the capital market this year. "I can't give you any deadline about mobile phone companies, but we have started informal talks with them," he told a press conference at the SEC office. He said 2007 had been an extraordinary year that saw record highs in indices, turnover and market capitalisation. "And for that, the SEC had to take a pro-active role to maintain discipline in the market," the chairman said. "We as the regulator definitely need to observe the market and its trends closely to make the year a successful one for the capital market," he told reporters, adding that the year ahead would be a challenging one for market participants. "I want to tell retail investors don't come to invest with all of your savings; invest only if you have excess savings," Siddiqi said when asked what advice the SEC had for small investors. He urged small investors to back scrips only after carefully evaluating the company fundamentals and share-related factors such as dividends and price to earning ratio. He also cautioned them to avoid investments on credit as much as possible as loan repayments would lead to increased risk. SEC executive director Farhad Ahmed also addressed the media, to explain some of the regulatory body's recent decisions. "Everyone thinks that the SEC makes arbitrary decisions all of a sudden, which is not true at all," he said. He cited the abnormal surges that the market has witnessed from the start of 2007: "On July 22, the index rose 58 points; as an instant reaction we ordered five major companies to go to spot trading to cool down the market." As excess liquidity led to an abnormal heating of the market, on July 30 the regulators slapped a restriction on financial adjustments, the SEC executive director further explained. "On Nov 15, the index crossed the 3000 mark for the first time in its history." "As a consequence we withdrew the margin loan facilities of merchant banks and fixed the ratio at 1 to 0.5." However, on Feb 3, the SEC took a U-turn and withdrew the restriction on financial adjustments, and reset the margin loan ratio for merchant banks at 1:1. Farhad explained the change in policy by saying: "The restrictions hampered the flow of funds into the market as it returned to normal." Also, the direct listing of state-owned Jamuna and Meghna oil companies caused a huge outflow of funds from the market, he said. bdn
