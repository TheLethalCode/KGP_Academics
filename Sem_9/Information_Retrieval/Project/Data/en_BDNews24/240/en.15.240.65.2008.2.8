 Chittagong, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com)  Indian high commissioner Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty Friday said he believed Bangladesh would soon return to democracy. Speaking to reporters after the inauguration of an exhibition of contemporary arts in the High Commission's Chittagong office, the Indian envoy hoped the government would work to hold elections in line with the Election Commission roadmap. "I believe the present government will hold polls by the given period and people will select their leader." On human rights in Bangladesh, he said every government under a democratic system should ensure human rights in line with the constitution. He said he did not know if the present government violated human rights but welcomed the formation of the human rights commission. Referring to India's move to export 5 lakh tonnes of rice in the wake of the devastation left by cyclone Sidr, the Indian envoy said relations between India and Bangladesh had been "very good". He said export of Bangladeshi goods to India had increased and the trade deficit between the countries narrowed. Chakravarty said the process of extradition of criminals had begun although there had been no treaty between the countries. He hoped cultural exchange programmes between the next-door neighbours would further strengthen the bilateral relationship. The envoy's wife Radha Rani Chakravarty inaugurated the 15-day exhibition by lighting candles. Forty works of 23 artists have been put on display. bdnews
