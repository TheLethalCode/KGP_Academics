<TEXT>
 SAITAMA, Japan, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan beat Thailand 4-1 in freezing conditions to win their opening 2010 World Cup qualifier on Wednesday. Thailand's players, normally accustomed to tropical heat, were given little chance with snow falling in Saitama but they made life difficult for Japan in the first half. Midfielder Yasuhito Endo gave Japan the lead in the 21st minute with a superb curling free kick from 30 metres. However, Thailand stunned the home side by equalising within a minute when forward Teerathep Winothai smashed a ferocious shot past Japan keeper Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi from the edge of the box. Japan, booed off at halftime by the crowd of 35,000, went back in front 10 minutes after the interval when striker Yoshito Okubo prodded home from close range after an attempted Thai clearance fortuitously ricocheted into his path. Thailand had acclimatised for the wintry Japanese weather with a training camp at Manchester City but Okubo's freak goal effectively ended the visitors' resistance. "It was a very lucky goal," Japan coach Takeshi Okada told reporters. "But the players began the second half pressing for a goal so maybe deserved that bit of luck." FLATTERING SCORE Things got worse for Thailand when Narongchai Vachiraban was sent off before Japan defender Yuji Nakazawa made the points safe by heading the home side's third in the 66th minute. Substitute Seiichiro Maki added a fourth in injury time, stooping to head in a corner at the back post and give the score line a slightly flattering look. "These games are never easy," added Okada. "But we may have underestimated them a bit. Scoring three goals from set pieces is nice but it's worrying we only scored one from open play." Thai coach Charnwit Polcheewin, informed by FIFA on Tuesday that two first-team players would be suspended for the match, acknowledged the bone-chilling conditions had done his side few favours. "The weather was a big factor," he said. "With the snow falling, the ball was slippery and difficult to control. It will be more fun playing Japan at home." Bahrain and Oman are the other two teams involved in Group Two in the third round of Asian qualifyin
