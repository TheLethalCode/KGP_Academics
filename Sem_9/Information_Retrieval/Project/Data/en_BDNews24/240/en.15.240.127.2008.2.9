 Dhaka, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com)Supreme Court Bar Association president barrister Amir-ul Islam Saturday recommended formation of a "judiciary reforms commission" to strengthen the country's judicial system. Speaking at a seminar on "The removal of controversial judges is urgent" aimed to attract the attention of the president, chief adviser and chief justice at the National Press Club, the senior lawyer said: "The country is now passing through a critical time. An independent and clean judiciary is essential for the success of democratisation." "It's time for implementation. A judiciary reforms commission has to be formed on an emergency basis to remove controversial and inefficient judges." "At the same time, transparency has to be ensured in the appointment of judges. It is not proper to appoint judges through a secret meeting of a few. Some criteria have to be fixed for judges' appointment, including advertisements, written tests and interviews." The discussion was organised by the Citizens Rights Movement, a nongovernmental organisation. A 10-point charter of demands was presented at the discussion with a suggestion to establish a welfare and ideal state. Citizens Rights Movement secretary general Tusar Rehman presented the keynote paper. On talk of forming a national government, Amir-ul Islam said: "It is risky to do anything beyond the constitution. We have to proceed towards democracy from our present situation. We have to get over the critical juncture." ASM Abdur Rab, president of Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal, said: "It's sad that as per the statement of the chief justice there is no one to redo the damage to the judiciary. The Supreme Judicial Council has to be made effective to remove spineless, corrupt judges." Former lawmaker Faruq Khan mentioned that there is a provision in the constitution to remove the controversial judges and said: "I don't think that it's necessity to form a new commission. However, there should be a commission for appointing efficient judges in future." Dr Zafarullah Chowdhury of Ganosasthya said: "There should be a provision for publishing the wealth statement of judges to the public." Writer Syed Abul Maqsud said: "Reforms to the judiciary are inevitable." bdnews
