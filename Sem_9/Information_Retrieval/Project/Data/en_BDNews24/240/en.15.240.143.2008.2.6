 Dhaka, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com)  Two fifties from Shakib Al Hasan and Javed Omar guided the Team C to a 23-run win over the Team B in the sixth and final practice match ahead of this month's home series against South Africa. Chasing a target of 201 in 45 overs, the Team C, led by Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, folded at 177 with five balls to spare in the face of some tight bowling from Mohammad Sharif (3/28) and Mohammad Rafique (2/26). Sharif wrecked the top order to reduce the opponents to 40 for four before middle order Mahmudullah Riad and Alok Kapali provided some resistance with 45 and 34. Mashrafee and Dhiman Ghosh contributed 28 and 16 before Mashrafee was the ninth batsman out, leaving the side at 174 for nine in 43.1 overs. Aftab Ahmed took last batsman Nazmul Hossain (6) to fold the innings of the Team B. Earlier, Shakib hammered a fine 80 and Javed struck 53 as the Team C touched the 200-mark after opting to bat first on the slow wicket. Shakib and Javed also put on 90 runs for the third wicket after the Team C lost Rajin Saleh (3) and Aftab Ahmed (12). Left-arm spinners Abdur Razzak and Tariqul Islam took three for 35 and two for 49 respectively.
