 Dhaka, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com)Implementation of the Tk 1,474 crore Hatirjheel-Begunbari integrated development project has begun, local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal said Thursday. Rajuk, WASA and LGED, assisted by the Army Engineering Corps, are implementing the project, scheduled for completion by June 2010. The adviser toured the project area, when M Haider Ali, the project director, professor Mujibur Rahman from BUET and Major Anwar Hossain from the Army Engineering Corps highlighted various aspects of project implementation. The project aims at reclaiming government lands from illegal possession, improving the environment and easing traffic gridlock. Once implemented, it will cut water logging faced by the citizens residing and working in Tejgaon, Karwan Bazaar, Maghbazaar, Gulshan and Rampura areas, Iqbal told reporters. The adviser said that they were eyeing 175 acres of government land for inclusion under the project, which, once completed, should be minimising the estimated land acquisition costs (Tk 1,010 crore) of the project. Asked if the BGMEA building erected on a government plot should be dismantled, the adviser said that all the 11 structuresfive on private property and six on government land, will be demolished, if and when considered necessary for implementation of the project. The Sonargaon Hotel authorities had been requested to dismantle the extended portion of hotel built on government land and the land allotted in favour of Hotel Hilton too had been cancelled, Iqbal said. The project director said that government agencies LGED, WASA and Rajuk would work in their respective sectors while implementing the project. Prof Mujibur Rahman, responsible for the project feasibility study and design, said that WASA would build facilities to take the city's waste through two pipelines for disposal across the Rampura Bridge and treat waste water in a plant to be installed there. The removal of the initially earmarked 400 installations was now limited to the above 11 major structures to minimise costs and save time, the adviser said. bdnew
