 LONDON, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain has chipped in 20 million pounds ($39 million) as part of an international effort to clear debt arrears owed by Liberia to multilateral lenders, the government said on Thursday. The money was repaid to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the African Development Bank. The move is part of a drive to enable Liberia to qualify for debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, a programme to assist the poorest and most indebted nations, Britain's Treasury and Department for International Development said in a statement. It will also let the country access much needed new development funding to help it recover after 14 years of civil war, it said. "The UK government's support will secure Liberia's rapid entry into the HIPC initiative, which we hope will support its reform efforts and provide much needed resources for poverty reduction," International Development Secretary Douglas Alexander said. Liberia has $4.5 billion of debt.
