 LONDON, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US stock futures pointed to a subdued start on Wall Street on Friday, after a rebound in the previous session halted a three-day downward run and global stock markets held largely steady. Relatively low share valuations lured investors back into the US stock market on Thursday after a prolonged losing streak pushed the Nasdaq into an official bear market. By 1058 GMT March Dow Jones, S&P and Nasdaq 100 futures were down between 0.3 and 0.4 percent. The indicative Dow Jones index was also broadly flat, up by 0.11 percent. European shares were up 0.9 percent, helped mainly by oil and gas producers and miners. Market participants said Asian trade had all but ground to a halt as most markets aside from Japan closed for the Lunar New Year holidays. Friday's calendar is light on earnings and data for US investors who are already dealing with another 4 percent drop this week in the Standard & Poor's 500 and a 5 percent fall in the Nasdaq Composite Index. "On the earnings front there will be no big impact as there is no news from larger companies before the opening. It'll be a very quiet session," Roland Hirschmueller, a broker at Baader Wertpapierhandelsbank said. U.S. stocks have been under pressure since the start of the year as negative economic data and patchy earnings have raised concern about the likelihood of recession and the outlook for corporate profitability. On Thursday the U.S. Congress passed a nearly $152 billion stimulus package to stave off an election-year recession by sending government rebate cheques to millions of Americans and providing business tax incentives to boost spending. On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average was up 46.90 points, or 0.38 percent, at 12,247.00. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up 10.46 points, or 0.79 percent, at 1,336.91. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 14.28 points, or 0.63 percent, at 2,293.03. S&P 500 companies set to report earnings on Friday were Apartment Investment & Management Co, Coventry Health Care Inc, Weyerhauser Co and Windstream Corp. On the data side, Friday was set to be relatively quiet with the main event of the day the release by the Commerce Department of U.S. wholesale inventories for December at 1500 GMT. Economists in a Reuters survey forecast inventories to rise 0.3 percent versus a rise in November of 0.6 percent. The market was also likely to keep an eye on Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Dennis Lockhart and Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Sandra Pianalto who are speaking at 1730 GMT and 1755 GMT respectively. Pianalto is scheduled to talk about the national mortgage marke
