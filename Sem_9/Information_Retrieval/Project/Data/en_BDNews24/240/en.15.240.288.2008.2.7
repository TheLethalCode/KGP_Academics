 Dhaka, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com)  The family of late artist Debdas Chakraborty donated his body to Ibrahim Memorial Medical College Thursday. "We have donated our father's body for the research of students of medical science according to his last wishes," Debdas's elder son Gautam Chakraborty said. The body was taken to the Institute of Fine Arts at 10:00 am, where director Abdur Shakur Shah and students of the institute paid their respects to the artist. The coffin was then taken to Central Shahid Minar for where the artist received a guard of honour and cultural adviser Rasheda K Choudhury led the offering of floral tributes. Debdas died at his Uttara residence Tuesday afternoon at the age of 75. The award winning painter had been suffering from a number of medical complications. The artist contributed to the liberation war by designing a poster that was a great inspiration to freedom fighters. He was an activist of left leaning politics during his student life and bore those ideals throughout his life in his works. Debdas entered Calcutta Art College as a young man in 1948, but could not complete his course for political reasons. He was later admitted to Dhaka Art College (the present Institute of Fine Arts). Here, Debdas had the opportunity to be close to the prominent artists of the institute at the time, including Zainul Abedin, Safiuddin Ahmed and Kamrul Hassan. Debdas graduated with a BFA in 1956. From1977 to 1979, he trained in the art of printmaking with a Polish government scholarship. He worked as a senior designer at Information Directorate under the ministry of Agriculture 1958 to 1970, and worked under the eminent artist Kamrul Hassan at the Information Directorate of the makeshift government of Bangladesh during the liberation war. Debdas was an assistant professor in the fine arts department at Chittagong University from 1970 to 1980, and has won art awards at home and abroad during his career. He was born in Shariatpur, and left two sons, relatives and many well wishers to mourn his death. Students and teachers of the Institute of Fine Arts, Jessore's SM Art College and Bengal Gallery of Fine Arts expressed grief at the death of the famous artist. bdnews24
