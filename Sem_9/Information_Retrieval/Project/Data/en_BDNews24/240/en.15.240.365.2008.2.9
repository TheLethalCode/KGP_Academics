 Kathmandu, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Three ethnic protest groups from Nepal's southern plains united on Saturday to threaten an indefinite blockade of the capital Kathmandu as they press for regional autonomy. Last year, protests organised by the Madheshi People's Rights Forum left at least 45 people dead in the Madhesh, or Terai region, where nearly half of Nepal's 26.4 million people live. The Forum has joined two other leading ethnic groups to form a "United Democratic Madheshi Front". Together they called for an indefinite closure of all trading points along the border with India and of all roads leading to the hills, including to Kathmandu, from Feb. 17. "The blockade will choke the capital and other hilly areas by blocking all supply lines from the Terai," said Rajendra Mahato, chairman of the Sadbhavana Party, a member of the Front. "We will peacefully sit on roads and stop all transport vehicles from running," he told a rooftop news conference. "If the government dares it can drive through our chests." Government officials could not be immediately reached for comment. Madhesh, a narrow strip of fertile land in the south, is impoverished Nepal's breadbasket. Nearly 90 percent of Nepal's foreign trade, including essential imports like oil, pass through the region. The Madheshis, who have ethnic, linguistic and cultural links with the people across the border in India, say they are ignored by the government in Kathmandu. They want more seats in parliament and government jobs in proportion with their population. Mahato appealed for all schools, factories, shops and transports in the Terai to close indefinitely four days before the blockade starts. They are also calling on people not to pay taxes. "This is our final battle. We want to ensure that the Madheshis don't have to struggle again for their rights," Mahato said
