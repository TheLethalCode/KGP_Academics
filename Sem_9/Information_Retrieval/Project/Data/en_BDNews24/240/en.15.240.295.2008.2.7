<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com)The caretaker government should make haste and hold elections by April-May, Sheikh Hasina said in special court Thursday. The Awami League president voiced the demand while speaking to lawyers and reporters at the Special Judge's Court-1 set up on the Sangsad Bhaban premises. Sheikh Hasina was produced before the special court Thursday morning for the hearing of a corruption case filed by the Anticorruption Commission accusing Sheikh Hasina of illegally awarding contracts for three barge-mounted power plants. The High Court Wednesday cancelled a separate extortion case against Hasina filed by businessman Azam J Chowdhury, and ruled that inclusion of the case for trial under emergency powers rules was illegal. Reacting to the HC's cancellation of the case, Hasina said: "The HC's verdict upheld the constitution and established the fact that bypassing the constitution is illegal." Khandaker Delwar Hossain said Wednesday that holding elections keeping two top political leaders behind bars will not be acceptable to anyone. He also demanded that all political leaders including Khaleda and Hasina should be freed immediately. Asked to reply to Delwar's comments, Sheikh Hasina said: "I want the polls to be held first, at any cost, as that is the most vital precondition to establishing democratic governance." "Holding the elections within April, May would be the most welcome move of the government," Hasina said. "Why should the EC take so long preparing the voter lists?" Hasina asked. "We need a government elected by the people right now. A government cannot function without public representatives." bdnews24.
