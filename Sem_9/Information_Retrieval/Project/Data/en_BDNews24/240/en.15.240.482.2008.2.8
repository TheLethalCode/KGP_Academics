 SYDNEY, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Adam Gilchrist and Michael Clarke made half-centuries to help Australia post a respectable total of 253 for six in their tri-series one-day international against Sri Lanka on Friday. Gilchrist got the Australians off to a solid start with 61 off 81 balls while Clarke kept the tail wagging with an unbeaten 77 from 86 deliveries at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Matthew Hayden, returning to the side after a hamstring injury, chipped in with a valuable 42 in an opening partnership of 65 with Gilchrist, but the only other batsmen to make a significant score was James Hopes, who blazed 34 off 29 balls. The Australians struggled to score quickly on a pitch and outfield slowed by a week of torrential rain while the Sri Lankans succeeded in getting wickets at important times in the first clash bewteen the teams since last year's World Cup final. Hayden made up his for absence from the last game with a typically aggressive display, belting five boundaries before holing out to Sri Lankan captain Mahela Jayawardene at mid-on off the bowling of Ishara Amersinghe. Ricky Ponting, who has been troubled by back pain in the past fortnight, opened his account with a straight drive four but departed for nine when he edged Chaminda Vaas to Jayawardene at a wide slip. Gilchrist, who is retiring from international cricket after the series, struck three fours and a six in a relatively subdued performance before he was trapped lbw by Chamara Kapugedera. Andrew Symonds (12) and Mike Hussey (10) were both dismissed cheaply as Australia slumped to 190-5 in the 42nd over before Clarke and Hopes put on 63 for the sixth wicket. Hopes departed in the last over, leaving Clarke stranded on 77 after a watchful innings that featured just two fours but was built on 45 single
