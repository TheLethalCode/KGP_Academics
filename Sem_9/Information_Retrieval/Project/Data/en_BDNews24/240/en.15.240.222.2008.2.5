 GAZA, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hamas's armed wing issued a statement on Tuesday claiming full responsibility for a Palestinian suicide bombing that killed a woman in Israel, identifying both attackers as residents of the West Bank. It was the first suicide bombing inside Israel claimed by Hamas since 2004. "The Izz el-Deen al-Qassam claims full responsibility for the martyrdom Dimona operation," Hamas's armed wing said the statement, referring to Monday's bombing in the southern Israeli town of Dimona. Hamas identified the two attackers as Mohammed el-Herbawi and Shadi Zoghbor, both from the West Bank city of Hebron. One of the attackers was killed when his explosives belt detonated. The other was shot dead by police. The last time Hamas's armed wing claimed responsibility for suicide bombings inside Israel was August 2004, when 16 people were killed and 100 wounded in explosions on two buses in the southern Israeli city of Beersheba.
