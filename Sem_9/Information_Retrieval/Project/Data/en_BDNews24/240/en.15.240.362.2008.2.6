 WASHINGTON, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Democrats Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton battled to a draw on "Super Tuesday" and John McCain took charge of the Republican race in coast-to-coast presidential nominating battles in 24 US states. In their hard-fought Democratic duel, Obama won 13 states and Clinton took eight, ensuring a long and difficult battle for the nomination. Clinton's wins included the key prizes of California and New York on the biggest day of US presidential voting before the Nov. 4 election. "There is one thing on this February night that we do not need the final results to know: Our time has come," Obama told cheering supporters in Chicago. "Our movement is real, and change is coming to America." McCain won nine contests, including victories in California and the Northeast, to take a daunting lead in the Republican race. He captured a huge haul of the convention delegates who select the party's presidential nominee, taking several big states where delegates are granted on a winner-take-all basis. Republican rivals Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee kept their hopes alive and vowed to fight on, but could face growing questions about the viability of their campaigns. Romney won seven states and Huckabee won five. "Tonight, I think we must get used to the idea that we are the Republican Party front-runner for the nomination," McCain told supporters in Scottsdale, Arizona. "And I don't really mind it one bit." RACE SET TO CONTINUE The mixed results, with all contenders in both parties scoring at least five wins, appeared certain to prolong the hard-fought nominating races. A new round of contests in a half-dozen states are scheduled within the next week. The Clinton and Obama camps said they expected the count of delegates for the night to wind up relatively even. "We think the delegates are going to be very close and we may end up with an edge there," Obama campaign manager David Plouffe said. McCain, who lost the Republican primary race in 2000 to George W. Bush, still faces a struggle to win over conservatives in the party, who have been unhappy with his views on immigration, tax cuts and campaign finance reform. "I am convinced Senator McCain is not a conservative, and in fact has gone out of his way to stick his thumb in the eyes of those who are," James Dobson, the founder of the conservative group Focus on the Family, said on Tuesday in a statement delivered to a talk show host. National exit polls showed more than half of Democratic voters ranked the ability to bring change as the top attribute for a candidate. Nearly one-quarter of Democrats voting in the party's 22 contests ranked experience, Clinton's selling card, as the most important attribute. About 44 percent of Republican voters preferred a candidate who shared their values, while one-quarter wanted a candidate with experience. More than half the total delegates to the Democratic convention in August and about 40 percent of the delegates to the Republican convention in September were up for grabs in Tuesday's voting. ECONOMY TOPS ISSUES Economic worries -- plunging housing values, rising energy and food prices, jittery financial markets and new data showing a big contraction in the service sector -- eclipsed the Iraq war as voters' top concern in both parties, exit polls showed. Obama scored victories in Alabama, Alaska, Colorado,Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, Utah and his home state of Illinois. Clinton won Arizona, Arkansas, California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Tennessee and her home state of New York. Clinton, a New York senator and former first lady, was battling a wave of momentum for Obama, an Illinois senator who would be the first black US president. Obama had surged in national polls on his message of change. "I look forward to continuing our campaign and our debate about how to leave this country better off for the next generation," Clinton told supporters in New York, congratulating Obama on his wins. Because Democrats distribute delegates in proportion to their vote statewide and in individual congressional districts, candidates can come away with large numbers of delegates even in states they lose. Aides for both campaigns predicted the contest would continue for weeks or months to come. Obama maintained his strong showing among black voters but also expanded support among whites, winning 40 percent in Georgia, exit polls said. Clinton, who would be the first female president, won heavy support from women and Hispanics, exit polls showed. McCain won in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Missouri, New Jersey, New York and Oklahoma. Huckabee, a Baptist preacher and former Arkansas governor, won in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee and West Virginia. Romney won in Alaska, Colorado, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota and Massachusetts, where he served as governor, and Utah, which has a heavy concentration of Mormons. Romney would be the first Mormon president. "It's not all done tonight. We're going to keep on battling," Romney said in Boston. Huckabee's wins were fueled by strong support from evangelical Christians, and he split votes with Romney among conservatives unhappy with McCain's stances on immigration, tax cuts and campaign finance reform. "A lot of people have been trying to say this is a two-man race," Huckabee told supporters in Little Rock, Arkansas. "Well, you know what, it is and we're in i
