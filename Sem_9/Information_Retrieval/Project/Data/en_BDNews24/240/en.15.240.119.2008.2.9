<TITLE> Sarkozy`s spox to drop out of mayoral race-report </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Paris, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A top aide to Nicolas Sarkozy could drop his bid to become mayor of the French president's former fiefdom after an informal poll suggested he could lose to an independent conservative, the Le Figaro daily said on Saturday. David Martinon, Sarkozy's official spokesman, trails local businessman Jean-Christophe Fromentin by five points in the race to run the posh suburb of Neuilly west of Paris, which Sarkozy represented as mayor and as a deputy in parliament. "Sarkozy, who could not accept the defeat of his spokesman in his own town, has few options than remove Martinon and replace him," Le Figaro said of the rightwing head of state. Contacted by Reuters, Martinon, 36, declined to comment on the report. France Info radio said Martinon had cancelled a news conference in Neuilly scheduled at 1330 GMT. Martinon was 20 points ahead of Fromentin at the start of the campaign but is now trailing with 40 percent of the vote to 45 percent for Fromentin, Le Figaro said. The first round of voting is due to take place on March 9 with a second scheduled a week later. Political observers say Martinon's bid has been dogged by his carpetbagger status and a failure to win over residents in the wealthy suburb. Should Martinon pull out of the race it would be a fresh blow to Sarkozy, whose ratings have plunged in recent months due to widespread public discontent over his handling of the economy and what many see as the over exposure of his private life
