<TITLE> Sarkozy meets taxi drivers as reform plans dropped </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PARIS, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy met cab drivers on Thursday, a day after a taxi strike prompted his government to back away from a proposal to open the profession to more competition. Taxi drivers blocked roads across France on Wednesday in protest against a report from a high-profile commission of economic experts appointed by Sarkozy to suggest new ways of spurring growth. The commission had suggested deregulating some sectors of the economy, including the taxi business, where drivers pay thousands of euros for a licence to operate a cab and where the number of licences is capped. The profession has long faced complaints that there are not enough taxis, especially in big cities like Paris or Marseille but France's 55,000 cab drivers feared that if the reform went through, the market would be flooded with new entrants. "We've been under pressure from big international groups that want to take away taxi drivers' livelihoods," Alain Estival, head of FNAT, an association representing owner drivers said after meeting Sarkozy. "Today the president has called time on that." With local elections looming next month, Sarkozy's UMP party has been anxious not to alienate support by pushing unpopular reforms but Sarkozy's spokesman said he still intended to make changes to improve service and create jobs in the sector. "It's not about deregulating the profession but rather about modernising regulation that is not working satisfactorily," spokesman David Martinon told a regular press briefing. The proposal to reform the taxi sector was one of the most visible elements in the report on growth by the expert commission headed by Jacques Attali, a former adviser to the late Socialist President Francois Mitterrand. Sarkozy initially suggested that he would adopt almost all the elements in the report and Martinon said he was still convinced there were not enough taxis. But Estival denied that increasing the number of taxis was the best solution. "There is a constant increase in the number of taxis. Taxis have created more jobs in five years than (aircraft maker) Airbus has lost," he said.
