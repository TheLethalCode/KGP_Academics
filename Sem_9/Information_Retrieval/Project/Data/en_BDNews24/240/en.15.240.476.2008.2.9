 Sirajganj, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com) UK secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs David Miliband visited a DFID-funded Chars Livelihoods Programme in the Jamuna River Saturday. The UK foreign minister told reporters after the tour that the British government had already contributed 120 million towards the development of Bangladesh. Part of the funding is being used to elevate houses situated on the vulnerable riverine sandbars in the Jamuna River, under the Chars Livelihoods Programme. Global warming is an issue the whole world is facing, and Bangladeshis are not alone in their concerns, said Miliband, who had worked as the environment secretary before he was appointed as foreign minister. Miliband spoke to reporters after touring Baliapara village, located on one of the many sandbars in Sirajganj district. Earlier, Miliband met with villagers who had benefited from the DFID project and discussed the unique problems faced by those living in the area. Local men and women told the visiting UK lawmaker about the problems they have during the annual floods, health issues and how they cultivate the sandy soil. British high commissioner to Bangladesh Anwar Choudhury accompanied the Miliband. bdnews2
