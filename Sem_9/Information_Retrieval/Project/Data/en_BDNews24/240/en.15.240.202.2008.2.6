<TITLE> India Bharti: KKR to invest $250 mln in tower unit </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MUMBAI, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's top mobile operator, Bharti Airtel, said on Wednesday private equity Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co (KKR) had agreed to invest $250 million in its tower unit. Bharti Infratel owns 20,000 mobile towers and 42 percent in a joint venture company, Indus Towers, along with Britain's Vodafone and No. 6 mobile firm Idea Cellular. In December, the New Delhi-based mobile operator had said it was selling a 9 percent stake in the tower unit for $1 billion to seven international investors, including Singapore's Temasek, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. India is the fastest growing mobile services market that has been adding about eight million subscribers a month. The outlook for growth is huge as rising incomes, cheap tariffs and expansion of networks to rural areas boost demand. With 233.6 million subscribers at end-December, only slightly over a fifth of India's population has access to a mobile phone now. On Monday, smaller rival Reliance Communications said it plans to sell 10 percent of its tower unit in an initial public offer that media reports say may raise about $1.5 billion. Firms like Bharti and Reliance that have a nationwide presence are set to gain as other operators expanding to smaller towns and hinterlands are looking to share mobile towers to keep costs down and boost profits amid intense price competition and a surge in low-income subscribers. Shares in Bharti ended down 3.8 percent at 900.40 rupees in a weak Mumbai market that fell 2.8
