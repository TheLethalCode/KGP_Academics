 KOLKATA, India, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A strike over the killing of protesters by police in eastern India shut schools, offices, and businesses on Wednesday, bringing another political headache for a troubled communist-led state government. Protesters stopped trains and buses in West Bengal's state capital, Kolkata, as the strike took hold, witnesses and police said. The strike was called by the Forward Bloc, an ally of the state government, after police opened fire on their supporters in a northern district on Tuesday, killing at least six people. The rally, by villagers wanting work under a rural employment guarantee scheme and demanding the cancellation of plans to set up industry on farmland, turned ugly as protestors tried to force their way into a government building in Cooch Behar district. The violence has become an embarrassment for West Bengal's government, a key supporter of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, which has lost support and credibility over the last year as a series of protests against its plan to industrialise the state. Strike supporters waving red flags hurled banana leaves on overhead electric wires to stop local trains. Dozens of protestors were arrested by police throughout the state as they tried to block roads and stop buses in the streets. The world's longest-serving democratically elected communist government returned to power for a seventh term in West Bengal last year, pushing a reformist programme of industrial expansion after decades of land reform. But analysts say regular strikes and continuing violence could hurt their effort to woo industry. Last year, they were forced to abort a so-called special economic zone (SEZ) in the state's Nandigram area last year, as villagers refused to give up their farmland. Although the project has been shelved, political hostilities have not abated and at least 35 villagers have been killed in clashes over the last year. Strike supporters were chanting anti-government slogans on Wednesday as Forward Bloc supporters joined hands with the Congress party and Trinamul Congress, two opposition groups, to enforce the 24-hour strike. The Forward Bloc has been an ally of the Communist-led government for several years, but strains have recently surfaced between the two parties, especially over the setting up of SEZs. The government has put all SEZs on hold in the state. But they are still inviting companies to invest in SEZ projects. "The government has to come clean on its motives or face more protests," Mamata Banerjee, leader of the Trinamul Congress, the main opposition party sa
