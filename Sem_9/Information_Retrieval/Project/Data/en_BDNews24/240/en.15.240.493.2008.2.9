<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 09 (bdnews24.com)  British foreign secretary David Miliband Saturday said he saw a strong commitment from the caretaker government to hold the general elections by year-end. "He [army chief Moeen U Ahmed] was very committed to the idea that the army should stand above and separate from politics," Miliband told reporters at a press briefing at the British high commissioner's home. The caretaker administration has not given the UK any specific date for lifting the state of emergency, said Miliband, adding that he was told the emergency would be withdrawn as soon as it was "practical". "I was struck by the sincerity which both he [the army chief] and the chief adviser and others stated their commitment to a transitional democracy," said the UK's secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs. Miliband met chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed and Moeen U Ahmed Saturday to discus progress in holding the general elections and the overall role of the caretaker government and army. The UK lawmaker declined to comment on specific political issues such as former prime minister Sheikh Hasina's trial, saying these issues were for the people of Bangladesh to decide. The secretary said the caretaker administration should hold positive and constructive dialogue with the political parties. "Our policy is all along consistent. The UK supports the steps to elections in Bangladesh before the end of the year," said Miliband, who concludes his two day visit today. bdn
