 New York, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters/Billboard) - Missy Elliot is giving her fans the opportunity to name her upcoming album. Listeners can offer their suggestions at the rapper/producer's Web site, www.missy-elliot.com, until the contest closes on February 20. The winner, who will be announced on March 2, will receive credit on the album -- due in late spring 2008 via Goldmind/Atlantic -- and a $500 "Respect Me" Adidas gift card.
