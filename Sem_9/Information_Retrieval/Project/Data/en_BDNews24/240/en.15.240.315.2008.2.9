 CANBERRA, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Australian man was convicted on Saturday of killing his wife and then hiding her body in a metal drum in his garage for 23 years. A Supreme Court jury in the southern Victoria state found Frederick Boyle, 58, killed his 30-year-old wife Edwina Boyle in October 1983, and then hid her body in the large metal drum. The trial heard the murder came to light when Boyle's son-in-law opened the drum and found a bag of women's clothing during a clean-up of the family home in 2006. Two weeks later he found human remains in a garbage bin in the garage. Boyle had pleaded not guilty to the murder and said he hid the body after finding his wife dead in bed. He told their children his wife had left him and run off with a truck driver. But prosecutors said Boyle shot his wife in the head. Boyle remains in custody and will be sentenced later this month.
