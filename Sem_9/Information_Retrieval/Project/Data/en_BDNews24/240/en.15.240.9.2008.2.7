 Manila, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Philippine government on Thursday denied abducting a key witness in a Senate inquiry into alleged kickbacks in a telecoms deal with a Chinese firm in which the husband of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo has been named. Rodolfo Lozada, the head of state-run Philippine Forest Corp, was ordered to appear before the Senate to testify on the deal with ZTE Corp, but first left for Hong Kong and then was picked up by armed men at the airport when he returned on Tuesday night. "There was no kidnapping. There was no abduction," said Lito Atienza, the Philippines' environment secretary, in a hastily-arranged news conference in the presidential palace. "What I did was call General Razon (national police chief) and I told him Lozada needs security upon his return." Police admitted they had picked him up at the airport, although his family alleged that he had been abducted and petitioned the Supreme Court for his release. Newspapers splashed details of the incident and accused the government of trying to block his testimony. Arroyo has overcome three attempts to impeach her since she took over as president in 2001, on charges of cheating in elections and corruption. Lozada dramatically resurfaced in the early hours of Thursday morning at a news conference held in a gymnasium at a Catholic high school in Manila, but was not clear where he had been since he was taken by police at the airport and how he was freed. Lozada backed up allegations, previously aired by other witnesses in a Senate inquiry, implicating the former election commission chief, Benjamin Abalos, in a multi-million dollar kickbacks scandal over the deal with ZTE to supply a broadband network to link government agencies. The name of Mike Arroyo, the president's husband and a golfing buddy of Abalos, has also cropped up in the inquiry. Arroyo and Abalos have denied any wrongdoing. ZTE won the $330 million contract last year but the government scrapped it due to the allegations. Abalos was forced to resign as head of the election commission. Lozada, surrounded by nuns and priests in his 2:30 a.m. (1830 GMT) press conference, said the police who picked him up from the airport drove him to a province south of Manila. "I guess there was some miscommunication because I did not know I was to be taken," he said, looking haggard and in tears. "I was not prepared for that." Lozada, who was hired to assess the technical aspects of the ZTE deal, said he was resigning as head of the Philippine Forest Corp. He said he had received death threats after being called by the Senate to testify. Senators said they would let Lozada rest and resume their public hearings into the kickbacks scandal probably on Friday when he was ready to testify. The public hearings had ended in October after the deal was cancelled. "It was clear he was abducted. So our investigation is now two-fold. One will focus on the deal, the other on his abduction," said Senator Alan Peter Cayetano, chairman of the upper house's anti-graft committee
