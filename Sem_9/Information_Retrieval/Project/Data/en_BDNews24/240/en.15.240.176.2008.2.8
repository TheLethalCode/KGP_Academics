<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com)  UK foreign secretary David Miliband Friday said Bangladesh must lift emergency to let democracy work. Updates 2 with more quotes "It obviously requires the lifting of the state of emergency as well because a fully functioning democracy doesn't function under a state of emergency," the UK secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs told a programme in Dhaka. He also hoped that Bangladesh would soon turn into a fully functioning democracy, which, among others, needed an independent judicial system and vibrant media. "I look forward to the commitments of the government being fulfilled and a free and fair election being held, at the latest, by December 2008," he said. The UK minister extended support to the caretaker government and hoped it would fulfil its commitment to hold the ninth parliamentary polls by Dec. "We welcome the signs of a movement towards the democratic elections even before December 2008." "We have obviously touched domestic situation here in Bangladesh. We are impressed by the steps forward, welcome steps forward, that have been taken over the last difficult year by the caretaker government," said the UK foreign secretary. Miliband sought help from Bangladesh to curb political extremism and maintain regional stability. "Political extremism does not respect national boundaries. It is a threat to the nations all over the world. We want to work together to tackle extremism and terrorism wherever they are." Miliband arrived in Dhaka Friday afternoon on a two-day visit by an Emirates flight. Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury received his British counterpart at the airport. The British minister said his visit to Bangladesh ahead of general elections was being viewed by the diplomatic community as significant as he was expected to spell out the British government's position on the state of democracy, economic development and human rights in the country. He is to have separate meetings Saturday with chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed and army chief General Moeen U Ahmed. Miliband said he would raise the issue of lifting the emergency in talks with Fakhruddin . The UK minister spoke to the media after his meeting with three election commissioners, including chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda. "I had a very positive discussion with three electoral officials. I'm impressed by the professionalism with which they are approaching their task." Miliband referred to the 36 million voters so far registered with photographs under the present Election Commission, which he said shows "real commitment and high level of competence". "We had discussed the election timetable set by the caretaker government. We had also discussed the importance of local elections," he said. "I look forward to the completion of compiling the electoral roll," he said. Miliband will travel to the northeastern districts of Sylhet and Sunamganj to visit projects financed by the UK Department for International Development, Britain's development arm. bdnews24.com/kr
