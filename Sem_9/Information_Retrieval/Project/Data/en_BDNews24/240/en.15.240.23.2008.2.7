 Gaza, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli forces backed by tanks and warplanes launched a raid into the northern Gaza Strip on Thursday, killing five Palestinian Hamas militants, Hamas and medical officials said. Local residents said Israeli tanks and heavy bulldozers penetrated the border fence near the town of Jabalya in the coastal territory. An Israeli army spokeswoman said she was checking the report. A Hamas official said the militants belonged to the Islamist group, which seized control of the Gaza Strip in June when it routed secular Fatah forces loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Israeli forces frequently carry out raids in the Gaza Strip to try and stop militants from firing rockets at southern parts of the Jewish state. Hamas said it was responsible for a suicide bombing that killed a woman in Israel on Monday, the first such claim from the group since 2004
