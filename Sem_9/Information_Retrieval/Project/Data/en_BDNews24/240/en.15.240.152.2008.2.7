<TITLE> Romanian court rejects justice minister nominee </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BUCHAREST, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Romania's centrist government will have to find a new candidate for justice minister after the constitutional court said on Thursday that President Traian Basescu had the right to reject nominations. Senator Norica Nicolai was picked by the ruling Liberal Party to replace Tudor Chiuariu, who resigned late last year ahead of a criminal inquiry into corruption allegations. Basescu asked Prime Minister Calin Tariceanu to withdraw the appointment, saying it would undermine the credibility of the judicial system, which is under close scrutiny by the European Union. The watchdog Transparency International ranks the relatively poor Black Sea state, which joined the EU last year, as the EU's most graft-prone member. "The prime minister is obliged to propose another person. The court's decision is final and mandatory," the court said in a statement. The government was not immediately available to comment. The president's office had said documents from the prosecutor's general office showed Nicolai had broken the law when handling cases as a prosecutor under communist rule, some 20 years ago. She denies the allegations. The dispute between Tariceanu and Basescu, Romania's most popular politician, has left Romania without a justice minister for around two months, although an interim minister was appointed on Jan. 15.
