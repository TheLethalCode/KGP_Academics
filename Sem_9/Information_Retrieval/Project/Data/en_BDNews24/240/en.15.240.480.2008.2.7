<TEXT>
 GARHI KHUDA BAKSH, Pakistan, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The husband of murdered Pakistani opposition leader Benazir Bhutto used the climax of a 40-day Muslim mourning period to vow that he would risk assassination to win a posthumous election victory for his late wife. "If I am martyred before completing the mission of Benazir Bhutto, then I should also be buried here," Asif Ali Zardari said in a speech on Thursday to thousands of mourners gathered outside a white marble mausoleum in his wife's ancestral village. Pakistan votes for a new parliament and provincial assembly in an election that was delayed until Feb. 18 after Bhutto's assassination in the garrison town of Rawalpindi on Dec. 27. While not a presidential election, the outcome could have serious consequences for U.S. ally President Pervez Musharraf, who came to power as a general in a coup in 1999 and is now going through his most unpopular period. Zardari, who a day earlier scotched talk that he wanted to become prime minister, has not said whether he favoured working with or against Musharraf should the Pakistan People's Party ride a wave of sympathy to victory in the vote later this month. The PPP's likely choice for the premiership is its deputy chairman, Makhdoom Amin Fahim. LAST GOODBYE About 20,000 people gathered in the village of Garhi Khuda Baksh to pay their last respects to the most charismatic Pakistani politician of the past 20 years. Chants of Koranic verses and sombre hymns filled the chilly morning air in the dusty village set amid paddy fields in a rural backwater of southern Sindh province. Before Zardari could enter the tomb, hordes of people forced their way inside chanting "Long Live Bhutto", some weeping and beating their heads in grief. "This is the fight between establishment and the people," Zardari said in a speech imploring Pakistanis to vote for PPP. Moments earlier he had prayed at the rose petal strewn grave in the mausoleum where Bhutto lies alongside her father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Pakistan's first popularly elected prime minister. Her father was toppled and hanged by the military in the late 1970s, but the PPP still draws on his populist appeal. "Zulfikar Ali Bhutto laid down his life for his mission and so did his daughter. I myself and the party will take forward this mission," said Zardari, who spent eight years in jail but was never convicted of corruption charges he says were politically motivated. Conspiracy theories still swirl over who was behind the gun and suicide bomb attack that killed Bhutto. Controversy even rages over whether Bhutto was killed by a bullet or by a concussive head injury caused by the bomb detonated after an assassin shot at her from close range. Police have arrested two more suspects in connection with her death, the interior minister said on Thursday. "Right now, I can only say that two suspects have been apprehended in this connection," Hamid Nawaz told Reuters. Two others, including a 15-year-old youth who admitted being a back-up suicide bomber, were arrested last month. The government and the Central Intelligence Agency suspect the involvement of a Pakistani Taliban commander with links to al Qaeda, which they say is trying to destabilise nuclear-armed Pakistan. But, a poll conducted by Gallup Pakistan found that almost half of all Pakistanis believe government agencies or politicians allied to Musharraf were involved in Bhutto's assassination. A British police team that the government invited to investigate is expected to submit its report on Friday, according to Pakistani media. LEGACY The PPP named Bhutto's 19-year-old son, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari as party chairman and Zardari as co-chairman, in accordance with a will Bhutto wrote just before she returned to Pakistan in October, eight years after being hounded out. Oxford University student, Bilawal, has said he planned to pursue his mother's legacy after completing his studies, and neither he or his two sisters were at the graveside on Thursday. Huge portraits of Bhutto hung alongside the red, green and black tricolour of the PPP in and around the tomb. "The entire Bhutto family has rendered sacrifices for this country. It's our responsibility that we should support and pay tribute to this great family," said Majid Soomro, a farmer in his late 40s, who had come from a nearby villa
