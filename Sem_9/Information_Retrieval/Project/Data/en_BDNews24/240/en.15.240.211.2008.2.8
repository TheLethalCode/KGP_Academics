<TITLE> DU struggles to house residential students </TITLE>

 Jannatul Ferdous Dhaka University correspondent Dhaka, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com) Dhaka University residential students face an increasingly hard time finding space in halls as university authorities are struggling to accommodate all those looking for dormitory placements. DU vice chancellor Prof SMA Faiz acknowledged the problems faced by students: "We are currently housing just one third of the student population in halls. We are unable to accommodate everyone at this point." Provost of Bangabandhu Hall Prof Mahfuzul Islam said that there is insufficient residential space for an expanding student body. "Students for the academic year of 2007 to 2008 are being admitted before the previous students have graduated. This is escalating the existing housing problem," he told bdnews24.com. Prof Mahfuzul added: "After the August protests, the students who were living in the halls without official placement had to be given special residence cards in order to avoid further complications." Dhaka University has a student population of around 33,000, of which 15,120 are residential students. Most residential halls are presently forced to house more students than they can accommodate leading to severe overcrowding. Provost of Surya Sen Hall Prof Sirajul Islam admitted that even though there are 1,050 places in his hall, about 450 additional students reside there. Vice chancellor Faiz highlighted the especially difficult plight of female students from outside the capital who did not get university housing, as relatives in Dhaka were often wary of hosting young women due to prevailing social attitudes. Fatema Begum, DU's principal assistant proctor (female), illustrates the problems faced by a female student who was staying with her uncle until her cousin's offensive behaviour forced her return to her home-town of Jessore. She missed a month of classes. The student made a desperate plea to the proctor's office about her housing issue two weeks prior to her first year final examinations. Fatema Begum made efforts to place her at Rokeya Hall. The student finally received a placement just one week before the exams. There are four women-only residential halls, which face some of the worst overcrowding. Another student of political science, Sabrina Tasnim, was able to find a place with a relative in Dhaka, but even so had difficulty attending classes during her first year as she was staying at her aunt's house in Savar on the outskirts of Dhaka. She is still trying to find a placement in Bangladesh-Kuwait Moitree Hall. Prof Faiz pointed out that many universities abroad have student dormitories off campus, for which university authorities provide support and security as required. Students in other countries are also able to rent private lodgings for themselves. Prof Faiz said that such solutions might ease the current student housing problems at DU, but only partially. "We need additional halls but we lack the space," said the VC, adding that the ideal solution would be a second campus to house additional halls. bdnews24
