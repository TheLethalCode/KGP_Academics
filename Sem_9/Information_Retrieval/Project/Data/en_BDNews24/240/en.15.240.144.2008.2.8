 Chittagong, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com)  Experts estimate up to 75 percent of the global cases of blindness and visual impairment live in Southeast Asia, while 90 percent of cases are found in the developing world. Members of the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness (IAPB) gave the figure while briefed reporters at the conclusion of a four-day conference in Chittagong Friday. The experts also said if proper steps were taken visual impairment could be prevented at a relatively low cost. "An adult goes blind somewhere in the world every five seconds, and a child loses his eyesight every minute," said Dr NGN Rao, IAPB trustee board chairman and Indian eye specialist. "At present there are 45 million blind people in the world and more than 300 million people with impaired vision. Seventy five percent of them live in Southeast Asia," he said. The conference was held at the Chittagong Eye Hospital and Training Centre. Dr Rabiul Hossain, IAPB chairman for the South Asia region and founder of the Chittagong Eye Hospital, also spoke at the press conference. Rabiul said this was the first international conference on blindness and visual impairment in Bangladesh. About 50 experts and policymakers from various countries participated in the seminar. The IAPB has stated it wishes to see new cases of preventable visual impairment halted by 2020. "Different countries and international agencies expressed their solidarity with our Vision 2020 programme," said Rabiul. "A meeting of the IAPB's board of trustees is held in seven regions of the world in phases," he added. bdnews24.
