 LONDON, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's leading share index, the FTSE 100, edged higher by midday on Wednesday as fears of a US recession prompted investors to pursue defensive stocks, which offset weakness in banks and miners. At 1146 GMT, the FTSE 100 was up 17.8 points, or 0.3 percent at 5,885.8, well off its day's low of 5,827.4. The index tumbled 2.6 percent on Tuesday, after a surprising fall in a key gauge of US service sector activity, bringing its loss for the year so far to 8.9 percent. "The ISM numbers basically confirm along with the numbers out on Friday that the US is in recession. The market has certainly not priced in a U.S. recession at this stage," said David Scott, a senior stockbroker at Redmayne-Bentley. "The Fed is not going to meet until March. It is unlikely that they will come out with another shock interest rate cut before that," he said. "The Bank of England may surprise us with a half point cut but I don't think they can do that with the inflation level. We are looking at a very negative outlook for the next week or so." The BoE is widely expected to cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 5.25 percent on Thursday. European shares also rose by mid-session. U.S. stocks suffered their biggest drop in nearly a year on Tuesday after the drop in the Institute for Supply Management's index of non-manufacturing activity, while Japan's Nikkei average slid 4.7 percent on Wednesday. Pay-TV firm BSkyB rose 5.1 percent after it said it was making more money per user, increasing customer loyalty and operating in line with targets. Defensive shares gained as investors decided to play it safe. Index heavyweight Vodafone advanced 0.3 percent, Imperial Tobacco added 2.5 percent, United Utilities put on 1.5 percent, British Energy rose 3.2 percent and Cadbury tacked on 2.1 percent. Banks, however, were the worst hit, taking nearly 10 points off the index. Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, Lloyds TSB, HBOS and Standard Chartered lost between 0.9 and 2.3 percent. A survey showed consumer confidence in Britain fell to its lowest level in nearly four years in January as uncertainty over the economic outlook was compounded by market gyrations and inflation. OILS GAIN BP rose 0.9 percent after Credit Suisse lifted its price target and as crude prices ticked higher. Other oil shares were also firmer. BHP Billiton shed 4.5 percent after the world's biggest mining group launched a hostile $147.4 billion bid for rival Rio Tinto in a move that could trigger a Chinese-led counterbid in the world's second biggest corporate takeover. (For the latest stories on the Rio bid, double click on) Rio dropped 0.2 percent, while the rest of the mining sector also eased as base metal prices dipped. Anglo-Swiss miner Xstrata, however, advanced 1.9 percent as traders cited market talk of a bid from Brazil's Vale. Xstrata declined to comment. AstraZeneca and Sage fell after trading without the rights of dividend. "We are starting to get indications right now that there are signs of weakness beginning to creep into the economy, but nothing at this stage is terribly serious. The Bank of England will give a 25-basis point (cut) tomorrow," said Peter Dixon, UK economist at Commerzbank. "It will remain in a wait-and-see mode but it's going to cut by at least 75 basis points this year and obviously if the economy tanks, it will go by more. It has got more scope to do so than the Fed has no
