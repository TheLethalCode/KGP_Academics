<TITLE> Lower house of French parliament approves EU treaty </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PARIS, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The National Assembly, the lower house of the French parliament, on Thursday easily approved an EU reform treaty to overhaul the bloc's institutions, nearly 3 years after France rejected the EU constitution in a referendum. The Senate, the upper house, must also vote on the treaty and is expected to do so before parliament breaks on Friday for six weeks campaigning for municipal elections in March. The treaty replaces the EU constitution that French and Dutch voters rejected in referendums in 2005, in France's case with 54.68 percent of the vote. Its expected ratification by both parliamentary chambers will make France the fifth country to ratify the treaty after Hungary, Malta, Romania and Slovenia. Only Ireland will hold a referendum on the treaty, as required by its constitution. The Treaty of Lisbon, which must win the approval of all 27 members to take effect, gives the bloc a long-term president, a more powerful foreign policy chief, more democratic decision making and more say for European and national parliaments. It drops contentious symbols of statehood such as the flag and anthem, which were among elements voters disliked in 2005. The national assembly, where President Nicolas Sarkozy's conservative UMP party has a comfortable majority, voted 336 to 52 in favour of the treaty. Many opposition Socialists voted for the charter, but the party has been divided on how to reform the EU institutions since some of its most prominent members campaigned against the constitution in 2005.
