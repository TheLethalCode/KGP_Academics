<TEXT>
 Tokyo, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks edged lower on Thursday, taking their lead from US share markets, with investors also fretting over Japanese firms such as electronics giant Sony cutting their profit forecasts as US consumers spend less. Supply problems in South Africa kept platinum prices near their record of $1,819 an ounce earlier this week, but oil dipped below $87 a barrel to near their lowest since last October on signs of weaker demand in the United States, the world's top consumer. Japan's benchmark Nikkei stock index slipped 0.8 percent as banks such as Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, down 3.9 percent, struggled. Losses in BHP Billiton Ltd led a near-2 percent slide in Australian shares Lunar New Year holidays brought trading in much of Asia to a halt, with markets in China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia closed until next week. Tokyo shares took a cue from Wall Street's 65 point drop on Wednesday, but were also weighed down as investors shed stocks on concerns over reduced earnings forecasts. "Japanese shares are very cheap in terms of valuation and other measures, but the market doesn't see it that way unless it is convinced of a good corporate earnings outlook," said Kenichi Hirano, operating officer at Tachibana Securities. "And corporate earnings are getting weak." The dollar held steady against the yen at around 106.40 yen, and was supported versus the euro at around $1.4625 ahead of a policy announcement by the European Central Bank later on Thursday. The ECB is widely expected to hold interest rates at 4 percent, and investor focus is likely to be on whether the ECB would keep its vigilance on inflation risks even as signs show that economic growth in the region may be slowing. In Australia, top miner BHP Billiton eased 0.8 percent, while its hostile takeover target Rio Tinto Ltd was off 1.5 percent at 0200 GMT. Rio has rejected BHP's $147 billion bid, the second biggest in corporate history. While Japanese investors worried about lower earnings forecasts from the likes of Sony, financial group Orix and electronic parts maker Taiyo Yuden Co Ltc, shares in video game maker Capcom Co jumped nearly 15 percent after it raised its full-year operating profit guidance. Japan's broader TOPIX index fell 1.3 percent, and has dropped more than 13 percent so far in 2008. US Federal Reserve officials warned on Wednesday that the central bank could not drop its guard on fighting inflation, while also expressing concern about a possible U.S. recession. Japanese government bonds slipped in early trade, pushing up the benchmark 10-year yield 1.5 basis points to 1.420 percent. Losses were limited as concerns about a possible US recession and problems in the bond insurer sector meant there was still good demand for safe-haven government debt. US crude oil for March delivery was down 31 cents at $86.81 a barrel on the Globex electronic trading platform, though trade was thin with much of Asia closed. Oil prices have tumbled from a January record high above $100 on fears that the US economy is slipping into recession. Gold slipped below $900 an ounce
