<TITLE> Jan 11 was an accident: Sultana Kamal </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com)  Former caretaker government Sultana Kamal Thursday said she believed Jan 11 was an accident in the democratic process and none could duck the responsibility for it. She made the remark at a roundtable organised by Bangladesher Samyabadi Dal (M-L) titled "The prevailing political crisis and ways to overcome it," at the Jatiya Press Club. "I have seen much politics. I won't accept the members of the last parliament as politicians. We have travelled from stadium to stadium with boys half our age. How much of an honest role have we played? "I don't expect much from this government. Election has to be fair and held earlier. Those who work for the people's welfare are politicians. Such people must come to power through elections. Otherwise, the election will not be fair." Workers Party president Rashed Khan Menon, Communist Party of Bangladesh (CPB) general secretary Mujahidul Islam Selim, former army chief Harun-or-Rashid, Ganoforum presidium member Pankaj Bhattacharya BNP chairperson's adviser Mofazzal Karim and Mozaffar Hossain Paltu also spoke. Samyabadi Dal general secretary Dilip Barua read out the keynote paper. Menon said, "We should return to the point of free and neutral election. The question of returning to the sick pre-Jan 11 politics does not arise at all. In that case, people will not accept any step bypassing elections." Selim said, "The prevailing situation is the result of deviation from the spirit of the independence war. Politics has now become more of an investment." Criticising the Awami League and the BNP, he said, "They skipped a national function because Jamaat elements would be there. We unanimously boycotted the national function. But barely after one month, they went to (US charge d'affaires) Geeta Pasi's residence for dinner with the Jamaat leaders." Harun-or-Rashid said, "There was no participation of people in January 11 incidents. However, the people supported it." "Reform will not come if some people at the top are removed and replaced with some new people. Change of policy, rather than change of individuals, is more important. I don't think the country will benefit from the politics of 'breaking and making'. The only way to overcome this situation is election." Bhattacharya was critical of the caretaker government. "Seventy percent officials of the administration are yet those who served the four-party alliance government. There are instances that an [superintendent of police] is a staunch supporter of Jamaat-e-Islami or BNP. The administration is adopting a lethargic policy." "Reform is for administration, not for politics. A meaningful change is for politics. The local government has to be saved to save politics." The former left-leaning leader said, "Those who violated the guidelines of the three alliances are people's enemy. We have failed to get rid of sick politics." Bhattacharya demanded public apology from those who violated the 23- point charter of the 14-party grand alliance. bdnews24.
