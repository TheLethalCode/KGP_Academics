 Dhaka, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Wednesday scrapped an extortion case against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina after ruling illegal its trial under emergency powers rules. The verdict is deemed crucial as it is expected to determine the fate of other similar cases marked for trial under emergency powers rules in a controversial move denying the accused the right to seek bail. But the legal battle is far from over as the government moved just as quickly to file an appeal urging the Appellate Division to halt the High Court verdict. A two-member bench of Justice Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Justice Shahidul Islam handed down the judgement after starting delivering the verdict Tuesday on an writ appeal by Hasina. After the judgment, defence lawyer barrister Rafiq-ul Haque told reporters, "The law has prevailed. The High Court has cancelled the extortion case against Sheikh Hasina." The defence argued that the incident that allegedly had taken place years before the state of emergency had been declared could not be brought under the emergency rules. A case taken under the cover of emergency rules means the accused lose the right to seek bail. The case filed on June 13 charges the former prime minister with taking Tk 3 crore in extorted money from businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury to let him build a power plant during her 1996-2001 term. The verdict is set to seal the fate of other cases pressed under similar circumstances. The court on July 30 ordered the government to explain why the case should not be declared illegal after the writ petition had been filed. On Tuesday, Hasina's lawyers said the trial court they no longer had confidence in the judge conducting trial of the same case and wanted a new court to run the proceedings. The defence lawyers said they doubted metropolitan sessions judge Md Azizul Haque would give a fair trial. They also accused him of bias and circumventing proper legal procedures at the trial and were preparing to petition the High Court to shift the case from the Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court set up on the parliament complex. The defence said they were not convinced that the court was in a position to deliver justice. "We have decided to file an appeal with the High Court for transfer of the case to any other court," defence lawyer Syed Rezaur Rahman told the court. "We have submitted the application notifying our intention," he said. His colleague Kamrul Islam accused the court of going by the diktat of the prosecution. The defence appealed to the court to adjourn the proceedings for two weeks to allow them to file the appeal with the High Court. Judge Haque heard the arguments by both sides and adjourned the trial until Feb 11. The defence's doubts about a fair trial brewed Monday after the court turned down a request to delete the deposition of plaintiff Azam J Chowdhury from the records. Judge Azizul Haque suspended the proceedings and abruptly left the courtroom amid a brawl between the defence and the prosecution. The defence argued that Azam's deposition had been completed on Jan 30 and that recording the plaintiff's deposition afresh Monday had been illegal. They also argued that the government had skipped filing an appeal in writing for recording Azam's testimony afresh. Hasina was arrested on July 16. The next day the case was taken under emergency rules and she was shown arrested. On July 24, a chargesheet was submitted to the court accusing Hasina, her sister Sheikh Rehana and Sheikh Selim. bdnews24.co
