 Dhaka, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com)  Mohammedan will look to resurrect their dented image Friday when they clash with arch-rival Abahani Limited in the second semifinal of the Proteeti Pharma Victory Day Football Tournament. Both Mohammedan and Arambagh have been fined Tk 50,000 each by the organisers on charges of 'unsporting play' as both sides tried to lose the match in desperation to avoid Abahani in the semifinals. Mohammedan, however, came from behind to beat Arambagh 3-1 in that match to set up the semifinal clash against their old foes. ATN Bangla will telecast the match live from Bangabandhu National Stadium at 4:15pm. "I don't think the dispute surrounding Tuesday's match will influence the boys much in Friday's match. They don't want to look back to whatever had happened in the past. They want to focus only on the semifinals," Mohammedan coach Shafiqul Islam Manik told bdnews24.com Thursday. Manik, however, said his side had been lacking in understanding among the players who had inadequate preparation leading up to the tournament. "If the players can apply common sense in the match, it is possible to get better Abahani, who are in a better position than we are with superb understanding," said the former national defender. The black-and-whites, however, will be boosted by the return of defenders Jewel Rana and Kamal, midfielder Sharif and striker Figo who missed the group's final match Tuesday. Manik said they rested six regulars against Arambagh with Jewel and Sharif having sat out the Arambagh match because of booking while Figo and Kamal with injury problems. Abahani coach Amalesh Sen thinks the Mohammedan-Arambagh match have affected his boys and dented the spirit of the tournament. "The tournament committee should have thrown out both teams or deducted their points, but they just fined them. It has upset the boys," he said. The coach, however, sounded confident of reaching the final despite the disappointment. Abahani would sorely miss Abul Hossain, who will have to watch the match from the sidelines having been booked twice. Amalesh claimed that Abul was booked only once, in the first match against Badda Jagaroni. The sky-blues, who are banking on team spirit, will also miss the service of striker Jahid Hasan Emili, the man who has taken them this far with two goals in the last two matches, because of bookings. The Dhanmondi-based outfit's coach thinks regular striker Shahajuddin Tipu will pair with either Robin or Tapu upfront. Abahani were stunned by Badda 1-0 in the first match but bounced back to confirm the semis by thrashing Dhaka Wanderers Club and giant Muktijoddha Sangsad. Abahani will look to settle score having lost the best-of-three fundraiser for the Sidr survivors 2-1 against Mohammedan in December. That should set up a classic clash between the titans of Bangladesh's football. bd
