 Dhaka, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com) A Dhaka court Friday remanded former BNP MP Moazzem Hossain Alal for two days, hours after the police arrested him at his Lalmatia home on charges of breaching emergency rules. Police arrested Alal, former MP from Barisal-2 constituency, around 8:30am and took him to the court of Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Emran Hossain Chowdhury with an appeal for a three-day remand. The magistrate approved two days. Sub-inspector Siddiqur Rahman of Mohammadpur Police Station appealed for the remand. Alal's private assistant Jahangir told bdnews24.com, "Plainclothes police arrested my boss from his home this morning." Mohammadpur police chief Shibli Noman said that Alal, also general secretary of Jatiyatabadi Jubo Dal, a front organisation of BNP, was facing charges of breaching the emergency powers rules. Alal had earlier been charged with breaching emergency powers rules in another case filed on Nov 7, 2007 after he was accused of having a role in harassing former army chief Mahbubur Rahman on National Revolution and Solidarity Day. bdnews24
