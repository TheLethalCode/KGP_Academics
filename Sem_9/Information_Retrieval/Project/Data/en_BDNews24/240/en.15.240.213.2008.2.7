<TITLE> US bans 10 over violence in Kenya </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NAIROBI, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States has barred 10 Kenyans suspected of being behind ethnic violence that has convulsed the country since President Mwai Kibaki's disputed re-election, officials said on Thursday. The move came as pressure mounted on Kenya's feuding parties to resolve a crisis triggered by the Dec. 27 polls that has killed more than 1,000 people and uprooted some 300,000 others. The violence has shattered Kenya's image of stability, horrifying locals, neighbouring states and world powers alike. US Embassy officials in Nairobi said letters had been sent to all involved and five of those banned from the United States were politicians while the rest were prominent businesspeople. They refused to give further details. Western nations have used such sanctions in the past against African corruption suspects, including high-level politicians. They tend to laugh them off or ignore them, viewing them as a form of neo-colonialism. "I have not received any letter and even if I received it, I would write back 'Heaven is not in your country, it is right here in my country," Justice and Constitutional Affairs Minister Martha Karua, one of Kibaki's toughest backers, told reporters. Canada has threatened to ban politicians guilty of stoking tribal violence, and diplomats say Britain may do likewise. "There is a precedent for even a head of state and their families to face bans," one Western diplomat said, referring to a European ban on Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe. Kenya has taken its own steps against a former British envoy to Nairobi, Edward Clay, declaring him persona non grata after his tenure ended. Clay is vocal critic of corruption in Kenya. TALKS Former UN boss Kofi Annan is leading international mediation efforts at a hotel in Nairobi where officials from both parties met on Thursday for more talks, and a string of outside diplomats came through. European Union aid chief Louis Michel was among those in Nairobi on Thursday, where he met with Annan, Kibaki and opposition leader Raila Odinga. Having agreed on principles to stem violence and help refugees, negotiators at the Annan talks are now stuck on the original bone of contention -- who won the December vote. But Odinga told reporters his stand that Kibaki should step down had changed: "We are not static on that point. We are willing to move so that an acceptable solution can be found." Annan denied media reports on Thursday that his hotel suite had been bugged. "That's news to me," he said. Foreign ministers of the regional bloc IGAD were also in town to meet Annan and among themselves, while leaders of another regional bloc, the East African Community, were due to arrive on Friday. The opposition had threatened to hold more banned street protests if IGAD's heads of states came. They say Kibaki is seeking to legitimise his position "through the back door" by playing host. Kibaki last week was recognised as a head of state at an African Union summit, a meeting which the opposition tried to get into but failed. Kibaki's aides say their man won the vote fairly, and the election board declared him winner on Dec. 30. Beyond the ballot, the crisis has laid bare divisions over land, wealth and power that date from colonial rule and have since been stoked by politicians, particularly at election time. Information Minister Samuel Poghisio said the images beamed around the world had given a false picture of what he called an "isolated case of some politically motivated violence". "Knowing Kenya's history, and the way that Kenya has been gradually climbing and not declining, sometimes a small valley is a prelude to a very good, steep climb ahead," he told Reuters. On Thursday police said they would charge one of their officers with murder after he was filmed shooting dead two young protesters in Kisumu last month in what rights groups and the opposition slammed as extrajudicial killings.
