<TEXT>
 SYDNEY, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gautam Gambhir and Mahendra Singh Dhoni shared a 184-run partnership to save India from a top-order batting collapse and make 267 for four in their tri-series clash with Sri Lanka on Tuesday. Gambir made the most of an early let off to smash an unbeaten 102 while Dhoni finished on 88 not out after the pair guided India to an impressive total at the Gabba in Brisbane. India, whose opening match against Australia was washed out on Sunday, looked to be in early trouble when they lost four wickets for 15 runs to slump to 83-4 in the 21st over. Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag had given the Indians a flying start when they piled on 68 runs in the first 14 overs before Sri Lanka hit back. Lasith Malinga bowled Tendulkar for 35 before Sehwag fell for 33, caught behind by Kumar Sangakkara off Ishara Amerasinghe. Muttiah Muralitharan then captured two wickets in his first over, Yuvraj Singh for two and Rohit Sharma for a duck, leaving India in disarray. Gambhir and Dhoni made a slow start as they steadily rebuilt the innings before a late flurry saw them pile on 105 runs from the last 10 overs. Gambhir, who survived a dropped catch from Sangakkara when he was on 11, hit 10 boundaries and a six and reached his third one-day international hundred in the last over, off 99 balls. Dhoni, who completed his 18th one-day half-century, struck five fours and one six in his 95-ball inning
