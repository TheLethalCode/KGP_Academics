<TITLE> 115 Titas staffers hand land documents to graft busters </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com)  More than 100 Titas Gas officials and trade union leaders Tuesday turned in documents on controversially-amassed land to an anticorruption taskforce, an official said. Lt Col ATM Hasan Ahmed, chief of the taskforce deployed at Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company, said that three of the trade union leaders sought refuge in hospital faking illness apparently to avoid any action by the government. They are Titas metre reader Mahbub and former CBA leaders Habibur Rahman and Abul Kashem. Ahmed told bdnews24.com that the government would complete all formalities of transferring the wealth of 60 officials out of the 115 to the government in a couple of days. The taskforce thinks the documents of 60 people are genuine and complete. On Jan 28, the Titas officials and trade union leaders pledged in writing to the taskforce that they would return their illegally acquired wealth to the government. The taskforce had earlier marked 1,000 people of the state-run company for amassing wealth by illegal means. Many of them have already been transferred to other destinations from Dhaka while many others are awaiting an order for relocation out of the capital. In October last year, the taskforce set up a camp at the building of Titas in Karwan Bazar. About the value of the property, Ahmed said it was not possible for graft busters to estimate total value. He said most officials recorded a less-than-real value of their property in the statements. bdnews24.com/ans/
