<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Party presidium member HM Golam Reza Wednesday sued former president HM Ershad's estranged wife Bidisha for not paying him back the money he had lent her. Metropolitan magistrate Md Emran Hossain Chowdhury heard the case and summoned Bidisha to appear in court. Reza in the case filed with the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka said Bidisha had taken Tk 2.13 crore in loans from him between 2002 and 2004 when she was the managing director of Cold Storage Ltd and AM Corporation. Reza was earlier issued a cheque on First Security Bank, but it was bounced. Reza on August 2, 2005 filed a case against Bidisha in this connection with the CMM's court. On May 22, 2006, Bidisha told Reza that she would take back the cheque to pay him back in cash. Reza withdrew the case in line with Bidisha's pledge in court. Bidisha allegedly broke her promise. She neither took back the cheque nor paid back Reza his money, it was alleged. bdnew
