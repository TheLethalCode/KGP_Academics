<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com)  A steady 50 from Habibul Bashar propelled the Team A Tuesday to a slim three-wicket win over the Team C in low-scoring fifth practice match ahead of this month's home series against South Africa. The Team A, led by Mohammad Ashraful, reached 137 for seven in 42.4 overs with 14 balls to spare, chasing Team C's poor total of 134 all out in 42.5 overs at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. After losing opener Junaed Siddique (1), makeshift opener Bashar repaired the initial damage along with Mushfiqur Rahim taking their side to 65 for two. Mushfiqur was trapped by spinner Enamul Haq Junior for 24, triggering a mini collapse and the Team A were reduced to 67 for four with Mohammad Ashraful (0) and Ehsanul Haque (1) returning cheaply. Bashar was the fifth batsman out for 50 off 80 balls with a four while Mehrab Hossain Junior and Mosharraf Hossain Rubel remained unbeaten on 28 and 13 to steer their side home. Earlier, the Team B, led by Shakib Al Hasan, could cross the triple figure after opting to bat first. Khaled Mashud played a patient 38 off 82 balls while opener Rajin Saleh made a 53-ball 29. Seven batsmen failed to cross the double digits in the face of superb bowling from spinners Musharraf and Ashraful, who shared seven wickets. Musharraf (4/24) and medium pacer Farhad Reza (2/11) wrecked the top and middle orders while Ashraful cleaned up tail with three for 26. Javed Omar (9), Aftab Ahmed (5), Tushar Imran (0), Mohammad Rafique (1) failed to live up their reputation once again.
