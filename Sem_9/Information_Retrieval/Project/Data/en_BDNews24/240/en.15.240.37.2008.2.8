 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com Energy Correspondent Dhaka, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com)The national grid may receive another thousand megawatts of power in 2008 from public and private projects, ministry officials say. Following a recent ministry meeting reviewing the state of power projects, power secretary M Fawzul Kabir Khan told bdnews24.com that 1,000 MW is likely to be added to the national power grid through the year "if everything goes well". "Contracts for new power projects have been finalised and some of them are already being implemented," he said. All concerned have been asked to complete ongoing projects as scheduled. Due to gas supply glitches, the secretary said, the current average shortfall amounts to about 500 MW. "A shortfall of 520 megawatts was recorded Thursday. The shortfall will be less when the gas supply improves." Ministry officials said an estimated 339 MW of power is expected to come from the plants established through government initiatives. Of these, Fenchuganj combined cycle power plant may start generating 66 MW as soon as March. Another 33 MW plant will is expected to be commissioned in June. Two units of 240 MW of production capacity will be commissioned at Siddhirganj in November. Implementation work of another plant with Indian collaboration signed on Jan 31, 2007, is also ongoing. A total of 610 MW of power is expected from private sector plants. A rental power plant (RPP) at Bogra may start producing 20 MW from March. Six RPPs under three-year tenures will start producing a total of 250 MW in different parts of the country from May. Another countrywide batch of RRPs under 15-year tenures are expected to start generating 140 MW of power from December, while another 200 MW will be added to the national grid in December. Taking all into account, the power sector estimates a total production boost of 949 MW for the national grid before the year is out. Due to gas flow disruptions, according to Power Development Board estimates Raujan power plant is currently producing only 90 MW against a production capacity of 360 MW. The 750 MW capacity Ghorasal plant is yielding only 610 MW, while Mymensingh RPCL plant with a 210 MW production capacity is supllying only 147 MW. Shikalbaha, which has a 50 MW capacity, failed to produce any power Thursday. bdnews2
