 Dhaka, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com)British Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs David Miliband arrived in Dhaka Friday afternoon on a two-day visit. He was received at Zia International Airport by foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury and British high commissioner Anwar Choudhury. Miliband's visit to Bangladesh ahead of general elections here is seen by the diplomatic community as a significant trip as he is expected to spell out the British government's position on the state of democracy, economic development and human rights in Bangladesh. The British foreign secretary has a packed programme on his two-day visit. He is scheduled to meet with chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda Friday, and to attend a seminar on 'Bangladesh's Future' at The British Council. He will have separate meetings Saturday with chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed and army chief Moeen U Ahmed. Miliband will also travel to the northeastern districts of Sylhet and Sunamganj to visit projects financed by the UK Department for International Development. He will attend a press briefing at the residence of the British high commissioner Anwar Choudhury, before leaving Dhaka Saturday night. Miliband is the youngest person to hold the office of British foreign secretary. He joined the cabinet of prime minister Gordon Brown in June last year. The visit by a British foreign secretary to Bangladesh is the first since Jack Straw accompanied British PM Tony Blair to Dhaka in 2002. bdnews24.com/
