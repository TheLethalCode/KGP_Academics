<TITLE> Philippine govt deals overpriced by 20 pct: witness </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MANILA, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Contracts with the Philippine government are usually overpriced by least 20 percent to facilitate kickbacks, a former senior state official told a Senate inquiry into corruption on Friday. In an emotional testimony, Rodolfo Lozada reiterated previous allegations that the Philippines' top election official had demanded $130 million as his cut for an eventual $329 million telecoms deal with China's ZTE, double the usual kickback. "The whole problem started when Chairman Abalos wanted $130 million for the project," said Lozada, the former head of the state-run Philippine Forest Corp. "I told him the $130 million was too much and too difficult to cover. Maybe, if it was only $65 million (that would be acceptable)." Lozada described that a 20 percent overprice in a contract of such magnitude would usually be acceptable. "It looks like that's the norm in government," said Lozada, citing as an example the $1.3 billion Southrail project to improve railway links to and from the capital. Some of the funding has come from China. Lozada said the cost of linking government departments in a broadband network, which is what ZTE had been contracted to do, should only have cost around $132 million. President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo tried to end the controversy over the ZTE agreement last year by cancelling the contract, but the scandal has resurfaced with Lozada's dramatic appearance before Senate. Arroyo's husband has been named in the controversy and Benjamin Abalos was forced to resign as election commission chief. Although deeply unpopular due to a steady stream of corruption allegations, Arroyo's position is not expected to be threatened from the latest revelations. The Philippine middle-class, instrumental in the overthrow of two former presidents, is fed up with political turbulence and wants stability, political analysts say. Arroyo, whose final term ends in 2010, has already survived three impeachment bids and would-be opponents are more concerned with preparing themselves for elections in 2010. Only around 100 protesters gathered outside the Senate on Friday chanting "oust Gloria" and carrying placards. A motorocade of cars driving around the city carried black balloons and posters of a picture of the president and her family labelled "The Arroyos", in a mock-up of "The Sopranos", a popular US television show about a mobster and his family. NUNS Police officers picked up Lozada when he disembarked from a plane at Manila's international airport on Tuesday evening and drove him for several hours to a province south of Manila, sparking fears that he was abducted. He was later dropped off at a Catholic high school in Manila and a group of nuns from the school has stayed with him throughout his public appearances. In sometimes tearful testimony on Friday, Lozada said Abalos had threatened to kill him if he went public with his allegations. The former elections chief has denied any wrongdoing. The government has denied that Lozada was abducted from the airpo
