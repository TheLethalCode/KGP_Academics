 Dhaka, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh national Under-19 cricket team leave the capital Saturday night for Malaysia to play the ICC U/19 World Cup with an eye on the coveted trophy. The tournament is scheduled to be played out from Feb 17 to March 2 in Kuala Lumpur, Penang and Johor in the southeast Asian state. "We want to return home having done 'something'," said skipper Suhrawardi Shuvo at a press conference at Hotel Sheraton Friday. Asked to explain 'something' meant, the left-arm spinner said, "You have certainly understood what I am trying to say, to return home with the trophy." "We first want to beat all three teams in the group phase and then want to go step by step on way to our goal," said Shuvo, whose team are in great shape, having recently played a number of series. They clinched a four-match warm-up series 2-1 against West Indies this month. They also crushed Sri Lanka and Nepal at home before defeating Pakistan 3-2 in the five-match series despite going 2-0 down in December. The junior team also outplayed South Africa, but went down to India in the tri-nation series final in South Africa. The team management wants to avert India in the quarterfinals, assuming that they will emerge Group D champions and that the Indians will top Group B, dubbed the "Group of Death" which also features West Indies, South Africa and Papua New Guinea. Bangladesh will be pitted against England, Ireland and Bermuda, and the Group D runners-up set to face Group B champions in the quarterfinals. "We want to become group champions beating England in a bid to avoid facing India in the quarterfinals as they are a very strong side," said coach Nazmul Abedin Fahim. Shuvo echoed Fahim but said they have gained more confidence from the way they had been playing for last three months. Bangladesh had quit from the quarterfinals in the last edition losing to England, who were whitewashed by the junior Tigers in a five-match pre-tournament series at home. Bangladesh finished fifth in ICC U/19 World Cup in Sri Lanka in 2006. Pace spearhead Shubhashis Roy thinks the inconsistent batting is their main worry, but adds that the batsmen have been practising hard this time around. Bangladesh have superb bowling combination with pacers Roy, Dollar Mahmud, Rubel Hossain and Gulam Kibria leading from the front and spinners Shuvo, KM Shakil and Nasir Hossain backing up. "The team has a plus point in that any one of them can turn a match in their favour," said special batting coach Minhajul Abedin Nannu. Squad: Suhrawardi Shuvo (cap), Dollar Mahmud, Rubel Hossain, Gulam Kibria, Rony Talukdar, Mahmudul Hasan (vice-cap), Nasir Hossain, KM Shakil, Mohammad Nadimuddin Mintu, Mithun Ali (wicketkeeper), Saikat Ali, Amit Majumder, Ashiqul Islam, Shubhashis Roy and Ashraful Hossain. bdnew
