<TEXT>
 OTTAWA, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Canada said on Friday it planned to keep its 2,500-strong military mission in Afghanistan until some time in 2011, two years longer than initially scheduled, and wanted shift the focus toward training Afghan forces. The plan is dependent on NATO sending more forces to southern Afghanistan, where the mission is currently based. It will be put to a Parliament for a vote in March and defeat would bring down the minority Conservative government. The main Liberal opposition party backs the idea of keeping the troops in Afghanistan for longer, but only if the soldiers avoid combat missions. The plan will be debated in Parliament, and government minister Peter Van Loan said Ottawa was open to amendments.
