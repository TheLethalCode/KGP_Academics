<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com)The government will shortly send a high-level delegation to Saudi Arabia to verify reports of a Saudi decision to cease issuing visas to Bangladeshi workers, foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury said Tuesday. Iftekhar, who is also in charge of the expatriates' welfare and overseas employment ministry, said the government had decided on sending the delegation after newspapers had published speculative stories that Bangladeshi workers were being banned by the kingdom. A number of Bangladeshi and Saudi newspapers have reported that Bangladeshis engaged in criminal activities in the kingdom were tarnishing the image of Bangladeshi workers there. The Saudi government has not sent any official notice to Bangladesh in this regard, according to the foreign ministry. The delegation led by expatriates' welfare and overseas employment secretary Abdul Matin Chowdhury will also report to the adviser on the conditions faced by Bangladeshis working in the kingdom. "I have instructed the delegation to submit recommendations on the condition of the Bangladeshis living in Saudi Arabia," Iftekhar told reporters at the foreign ministry. He added that he had instructed the Bangladeshi ambassador to Saudi Arabia to maintain contact with the kingdom's authorities so that no Bangladeshi workers were harassed. "We have excellent relations with Saudi Arabia. We are able to solve any bilateral problems through discussion," the foreign adviser said. There are two million Bangladeshis working in Saudi Arabia. bdne
