 DAMASCUS, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Syria on Thursday rejected as interference Western condemnation of a series of arrests of opposition figures. Responding to a request by Austria for "immediate and unconditional" release of 12 prominent dissidents arrested in the last few weeks, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said: "I consider this interference in Syrian affairs." Austrian Foreign Minister Ursula Plassnik raised the issue of the crackdown, one of the biggest in the eight-year rule of President Bashar al-Assad, with Assad and Moualem during a visit to Damascus. The detainees include opposition leader Riad Seif, who is sick with cancer. They face long jail sentences after leading a large meeting of the Damascus Declaration umbrella group of democracy activists to galvanise opposition against Assad. Assad also heads the Baath Party, which has ruled Syria since 1963, when it took power in a coup, imposed emergency law and banned all opposition. The United States, France and Germany have strongly condemned the arrests, especially that of Seif. "Such attention regarding Riad Seif has encouraged him to violate Syrian law," Moualem told reporters. Seif has been charged with undermining the state. Similar charges have been levelled against other dissidents, many of whom have already spent years in jail as political prisoners. Plassnik said the European Union "expects that Syria respects its international human rights commitments", and demanded a moratorium on capital punishment.
