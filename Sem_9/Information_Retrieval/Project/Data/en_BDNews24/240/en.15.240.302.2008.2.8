 Fahmida Wadud Chaity bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com)Research in the field of nanotechnology could bring new hope for sufferers of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, said visiting researcher Taher Saif at a BRAC University seminar Thursday. Professor Taher Saif of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign illustrated parts of his current research, which is supported by the National Science Foundation of USA. Both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's involve progressive degeneration of brain cells (neurons) causing loss of memory and brain function, as well as impaired signals to the muscles of the body leading to the severe shakes and tremors that characterise these diseases. Taher's research, which includes the mechano-sensitivity of single living cells, addresses the damage to neuron function that creates such overwhelmingly distressing symptoms for patients and their families. Cellular mechano-sensitivity, the latest field of research in biomechanical engineering or nanotechnology, can also usefully target the diseased cells of malaria sufferers. Red blood cells infected by the malaria parasite become up to five times harder than normal red blood cells, before shattering or breaking apart. Losing their normal flexibility they cannot pass through small capillaries and hence the circulation of oxygen through the body is hampered, the cross-discipline scientist explained. The study of mechanics has previously been the preserve of physics. But with cross-discipline sciences becoming more prolific, the integrated study of biology and physics is producing a new level of productive and creative research. The past decade of research in this modern field has found that not only biochemical stimuli but also physical environment has a vital role in cell function, Taher said. Over the last two years, for example, it has been found that physical or mechanical effects can allow stem cells to grow into a neuron cell or a muscle cell, he added. The mechano-sensitivity of living cells, in all animal species, from primitive to modern, has developed through the evolutionarily process. Prof Taher highlighted how mechanical processes in the brain allow the transmission and storage of data that creates memory and learning and sustains human thought. Research on the common fruit fly (Drosophila) using nano-scale force sensors illustrates that mechanical tension in axons, or the connecting cells in the brain, allows neurons to transmit signals or networks of neurons to store data. Prof Taher's research suggests that delving further into the mechano-sensitivity of the cells of the brain may give new clues and new approaches to the treatment of Alzheimer's and Parkinson'sas well as unlock the deeper mysteries of the human mind. bdn
