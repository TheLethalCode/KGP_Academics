 LONDON, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks erased early gains and Wall Street was set for a weaker start on Friday as the absence of key corporate earnings reports shifted the focus back to concerns over the health of the US economy. The six-month-old credit crisis has hit balance sheets of major investment banks exposed to the US subprime mortgage sector, threatening to hit corporate profits and drag down the real economy. Such concerns briefly pushed some sectors of Wall Street this week into a bear market -- a cycle that starts when an index falls 20 percent from a recent market peak. While this presents good buying opportunities from a valuation point of view, investor sentiment remains fragile, putting the focus firmly on a weekend meeting of Group of Seven finance chiefs in Tokyo which will discuss policy responses to the deteriorating economic climate. "There's still a bit of nervousness," said Neil Parker, strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland. "But ultimately I do think that the message is beginning to filter through that the central banks have acted swiftly enough to avoid the worst effects of the recent financial market crisis feeding through into slower growth." The FTSEurofirst 300 index was down slightly on the day, having earlier rallied 1.3 percent. The MSCI main world equity index was down 0.15 percent, having hit its weakest since mid-January on Thursday. U.S. stock futures were down around 0.5 percent. Earlier this week, the Nasdaq composite index briefly slid to a level 20 percent below the 52-week closing high set in October. Emerging stocks fell 0.2 percent while emerging sovereign spreads widened 4 basis points. ECB TO JOIN EASING CAMPAIGN? The euro was on track for its biggest weekly fall against the dollar in 1-1/2 years after European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet paved the way on Thursday for lower interest rates this year by stressing downside risks to euro zone growth prospects. The euro held near Thursday's two-week low at $1.4469, before rising briefly to $1.4516. The dollar ticked down to 107.34 yen. Trichet's dovish rhetoric has fanned speculation the ECB has adopted an easing bias. Lower interest rates are negative for the euro as they would shave the yield premium the euro offers against other currencies. Among G7 nations, central banks in the United States, Britain and Canada have cut interest rates to boost the economy, while the Bank of Japan and the ECB have held steady. "The general mood was that only the U.S. policymakers were doing something, yet the slowdown is global. Thus, at a minimum, European policymakers needed to start focusing on growth before investors became less pessimistic," Credit Suisse said in a note, summing up sentiment of its equity clients. G7 finance ministers and central bankers are expected to focus more on downside economy risks than currency issues. "Rising recession probabilities in the US and Japan are more imminent threats for the global economy together with continued financial market stress due to broader deleveraging, subprime and credit crisis," Goldman Sachs said in a note. The March Bund future was down 11 ticks. US light crude oil rose 0.5 percent to $88.56 a barrel. Gold ticked higher to $913.45 an ounce while platinum held below Thursday's all-time highs. Palladium hit a six-year high of $431 an oun
