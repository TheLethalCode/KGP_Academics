 COLOMBO, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lankan troops have killed at least 30 Tamil Tiger rebels including an area leader in fresh fighting in the island's north, the military said on Friday. Thursday's clashes along a "border" that separates government from rebel territory in the far north was the latest violence in a 25-year civil war analysts say neither side is winning.

Bus bombings and suicide attacks blamed on the Tigers are increasingly focused on civilians, as in earlier stages of the war. Experts say are targeted because they are less well protected and so easier prey. Thousands of people have been reported killed in recent months. The conflict that has killed an estimated 70,000 people since 1983. The bulk of fighting has been in the far north in recent months, well off the tourist track. But attacks are increasingly scattered, prompting some foreign governments to issue travel advisories. Officials say tourist arrivals, which fell 11.7 percent in 2007 from a year earlier with revenues down even more, could suffer further if attacks continue to spre
