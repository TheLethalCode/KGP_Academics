 Dhaka, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com)The driver of a car was killed at Banani level crossing Wednesday evening after a train ran into the vehicle trapped on the rail line, police said. The deceased could not be immediately identified. Railway police said the accident was caused by the deceased driving onto the wrong side to bypass cars crossing the rail line, and getting trapped on the level crossing. The train was the intercity Brahmaputra Express bound for Myemensingh and Jamalpur, railway police sub-inspector Sirajul Islam said. "We know that one person died in the accident," Sirajul said. He could not give further details. Deputy police commissioner of traffic (north) Morshed Alam said the private car was struggling to make it over the level crossing from the Airport Road side as the train was approaching. But the train reached the spot before he crossed. The driver died at the scene. The accident caused serious congestion during peak rush-hours on Gulshan, Banani and Mohakhali roads, leaving thousands of homebound people gridlocked in traffic for hours. bdnew
