<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com)  Sheikh Rehana has said the law and the truth had triumphed in an instant reaction to Wednesday's High Court verdict on the extortion case's legality. Rehana told bdnews24.com by phone from London: "God has shown mercy on us." "The law has triumphed; the truth has triumphed." A co-accused in the case, she welcomed the verdict that scrapped an extortion case against her elder sister Sheikh Hasina after ruling illegal its trial under emergency powers rules. Rehana said the verdict had proved the detention of Hasina was illegal. Rehana also thanked all the conscientious people of the nation for their support. The case filed on June 13 charges the former prime minister with accepting Tk 3 crore in bribes from the businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury in exchange for allowing him to build a power plant during her 1996-2001 term. Their cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim is the other accused in the case. A two-member bench of Justice Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Justice Shahidul Islam handed down the verdict Wednesday on a writ petition filed by Hasina challenging the legality of bringing the case proceedings under emergency powers rules. After the judgment, defence lawyer barrister Rafiq-ul Haque told reporters, "The law has prevailed. The High Court has cancelled the extortion case against Sheikh Hasina." The verdict is deemed crucial as it is expected to determine the fate of other similar cases marked for trial under emergency powers rules in a controversial move denying the accused the right to seek bail. But the legal battle is far from over as the government moved just as quickly to file an appeal urging the Appellate Division to overturn the High Court verdict. bdnews24.com/at/r
