 MOSCOW, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters ) - Europe's main security and human rights watchdog said on Thursday it had cancelled plans to monitor Russia's presidential election next month, citing unacceptable restrictions imposed by Moscow. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe's (OSCE) election body ODIHR said it would not send a monitoring mission for the March 2 election, which President Vladimir Putin's protege Dmitry Medvedev is expected to win easily.

Shortly before the OSCE announced its pullout, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov declared that Moscow would not bow to ultimatums and said the organisation needed reform to stop it from "inventing instructions". The dispute echoed a similar row last year, when the ODIHR pulled out of monitoring Russia's parliamentary election over similar issues, though the OSCE's parliamentary assembly did send a team. Putin's United Russia party went on to win a landslide victory. A spokesman for the Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly declined to comment on whether it would go ahead with its mission next month after the two OSCE bodies had pulled out. He said the head of an advance delegation currently in Moscow, Andreas Gross, would deal with the issue at a scheduled news conference on Frid
