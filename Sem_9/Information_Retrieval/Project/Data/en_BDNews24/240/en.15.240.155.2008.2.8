 NAIROBI, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Officials from Kenya's government and opposition said on Friday that talks to resolve their dispute over President Mwai Kibaki's re-election had moved forward but not reached a final deal. "I don't think it's really going to be a breakthrough, but rather an agreement of principles," a senior government official told Reuters. An opposition leader, William Ruto, said: "There is positive news, but no final solution yet."
