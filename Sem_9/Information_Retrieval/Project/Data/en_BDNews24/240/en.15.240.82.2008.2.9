<TITLE> EU Chad force commander vows neutral, robust action </TITLE>

 N`Djamena, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European Union troops heading to eastern Chad will keep their distance from French forces and avoid taking sides in the country's rebellion, but will attack anyone endangering civilians, the EU force commander said. Some 3,700 European troops are due in the oil-producing central African country, where rebels attacked the capital a week ago in two days of heavy fighting that killed at least 160 people and sent civilians fleeing to neighbouring Cameroon. The EU force (Eufor) will also deploy in northeast Central African Republic. It is meant to complement a much larger joint UN-African Union force over Chad's eastern border in Sudan's Darfur region, where civil conflict has fuelled a spiral of violence that has engulfed the two neighbouring countries. The EU, UN and African Union troops have a mandate to protect civilians and aid workers hit by the Darfur conflict. French General Jean-Philippe Ganascia, who plans to resume the force's interrupted deployment next week and be operational by the end of March, told Reuters on Friday he would not hesitate to attack anyone threatening civilians in the east. "If I have all the intelligence needed to know that those people I am now facing are going to attack somebody else, I will attack them too. I won't wait for them to attack if I can attack first," Ganascia said in an interview. But he said his troops would not block any rebel advance, such as the one that crossed the arid country last week from the east to N'Djamena in the west, unless civilians were in danger. "As long as they had not been attacking any civilians, NGOs or (UN mission) MINURCAT members ... they would have passed through and arrived in N'Djamena," said Ganascia, adding his task was to ensure security rather than peacekeeping as such. Nevertheless, the EU force would step up security plans for the road linking its eastern headquarters in Abeche to N'Djamena, where it is assembling mobile offices at a compound once intended to be the capital's new prison. Chad President Idriss Deby accuses Sudan of backing the rebels and called on Thursday for the EU force to deploy soon. DISTANCE FROM FRENCH FORCE The European mission will be made up largely of French troops, with smaller contributions from other European states. France already has troops and war planes stationed in Chad under a bilateral accord, and has vowed robust support for the government in its former colony since last weekend's attack. Analysts say France's position compromises the neutrality of the European mission, and some rebel leaders threatened last year to attack European troops if they stood in their way. But Ganascia, who reports to Irish General Patrick Nash at the force's strategic headquarters in France, insisted there would be no confusion with the French force, known as Epervier (Hawk). "I don't have any secret report to the French government," Ganascia said, adding he had deliberately avoided official contact with Epervier during last week's fighting. "There is not a single common point between their mission and ours." "On the TV during the events, two rebel groups' leaders made statements saying they had nothing against the Eufor arrival." The fighting, which damaged many public and private buildings in N'Djamena and triggered widespread looting, meant his force would not be able to start operations in the east until the end of March, three weeks later than planned. Deployment was delayed by several months, partly due to difficulties securing commitments of the necessary forces and equipment, such as helicopters, from EU member states. Ganascia said his force was tasked with securing an area 26 times the size of Kosovo, scene of a much bigger EU mission, and its 3,700-troop mandate was 1,000 fewer than first planned. "If I could get more, I would get more," he said
