 RUBOVC, Serbia, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci, a former guerrilla fighter, made a rare visit to a Serb family on Tuesday to urge Serbs to stay on after the Albanian majority declares independence from Serbia. "My message to Serbs in Kosovo is: stay in Kosovo," Thaci said over plum brandy and coffee in a rural farm kitchen. "Kosovo is going to make some big decisions. Status (independence) will be good for all citizens," the 39-year-old premier told his hosts, a Serb farming family in the ethnically mixed village of Rubovc. Kosovo is expected to declare independence this month with the backing of the major Western powers who see no prospect of returning the territory to Serb rule after its almost nine years under U.N. stewardship. Russia and Serbia strongly oppose the breakaway. Many of Kosovo's 120,000 remaining Serbs -- especially those living in isolated enclaves -- fear for the future and continue to take political direction from Belgrade. Some Serbs say they will leave. "We must turn to the future, not the past," Thaci said in Albanian, his entourage jostling for space with reporters around the dining-room table at the Slavkovic family home. Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo have led largely separate lives since 1999, when NATO bombs drove out Serb forces to halt the killing and ethnic cleansing of Albanians in a two-year war against the guerrilla army in which Thaci was a commander. Up to 200,000 Serbs and other ethnic minorities fled with the end of the war, and only a few thousand have returned. At the weekend Serbia re-elected President Boris Tadic, a moderate who wants Serbs to pursue a future in the European Union rather than turn their backs on Europe in revenge for it recognising Kosovo. Slavisa Slavkovic said he felt more secure after the visit but complained his tractor was older than Thaci, and he needed a new one. Pressed on the prospect of an independent Kosovo, he said: "I don't think about it. The world powers will decide that." There was a spattering of applause from a handful of local Albanians as Thaci climbed back into his black Mercedes. An elderly Serb, his face brown and wrinkled, stood by his gate watching the journalists. Asked about the prime minister's visit, he said: "Which prime minister? What does he want here?"
