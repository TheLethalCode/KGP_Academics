 LONDON, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European and Asian shares fell while the yen ticked higher on Thursday after warnings from major technology firms added to concerns that a slowing US economy might hurt corporate earnings globally. Tech shares suffered in particular after network equipment maker Cisco Systems late on Wednesday forecast disappointing third-quarter revenue growth, citing economic concerns. German chipmaker Infineon also warned of further losses at its phone chips unit. The six-month-old credit crunch, stemming from mass defaults on US subprime mortgages, has hit corporate profits and threatens to kick the world's largest economy into recession. Monetary policy decisions from Britain and the euro zone also prompted investors to cut back on risky positions. The Bank of England is expected to cut interest rates, while investors are eyeing any hints from the European Central Bank that it might ease policy later in the year. "It is reporting season that is dominating today ... Cisco gave negative comments reporting their forecast so there is a negative mood spreading to the tech area in Europe," said Achim Matzke, European stock indexes analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. The FTSEurofirst 300 index was down half a percent on the day, while MSCI main world equity index dropped a quarter percent to hit 1-1/2 week lows. The MSCI index is down nearly 16 percent from all-time highs in November. The iTraxx Crossover index, a key indicator for European credit market sentiment, widened to 519 basis points -- close to record levels set in late January. ECB LANGUAGE Cross market volatility pushed investment bank UBS's Risk Index higher to indicate increasing risk aversion, which tends to benefit low-yielding currencies such as the yen. The yen rose around 0.15 percent to 155.90 per euro although it was relatively steady elsewhere. The euro was also steady at $1.4619 before the policy decision by the ECB. The central bank is set to leave rates on hold at 4 percent in the face of above-target inflation and strong wage growth. "Our focus will be on whether (ECB President Jean-Claude) Trichet concedes that the outlook for slower global growth will reduce upside CPI risks and/or if he states that the Council considered all options, including an easing, which would shift the bias toward neutral," Calyon said in a note to clients. "The latter in particular would hint at a rate cut before the June move ... and prompt a sell off in euro/dollar." In safe-haven bond markets, the March Bund future was up 10 ticks. Platinum raced to set fresh record highs again as supply problems in South Africa attracted strong demand from investors. Platinum rose as high as $1,833.00 an ounce, gaining more than 20 percent since the start of the year. Gold was slightly higher at $904.10. US light crude extended losses, falling to $87.09 a barrel as concerns about the US economy and data showing higher weekly US crude and fuel stoc
