 Dhaka, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com)  Left-arm spinner Mohammad Rafique returned to the national cricket team's fold for Bangladesh's home series against South Africa. The Bangladesh Cricket Board Wednesday announced a 17-member squad for a two Tests and three-ODI series against the Proteas in Feb-March. Rafique was dropped from the Bangladesh squad during the recent three-ODI and two Tests series against the Black Caps in New Zealand in Dec-Jan. Except opener Javed Omar, middle order batsman Tushar Imran and pacer Nazmul Hossain, the selection committee led by Rafiqul Alam has pinned their hopes on the same line-up that travelled to New Zealand. The committee also has kept seven players, including Khaled Mashud, in reserve for the series. The exact make-up of the Test team would be announced later, said a BCB press release Wednesday. South Africa are scheduled to arrive here on Feb 14 and the first Test will take place at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium from Feb 22. The BCB also named a 14-member squad for the lone warm-up match against South Africa keeping 11 national players on the side. The three-day match (Feb 17-19) will be held at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. Squad for home series: Mohammad Ashraful (captain), Habibul Bashar, Aftab Ahmed, Zunaed Siddique, Tamim Iqbal, Shahriar Nafees, Mashrafee Bin Mortaza (vice-captain), Shahadat Hossain, Mushfiqur Rahim, Sajedul Islam, Shakib Al Hasan, Rajin Salah, Farhad Reza, Abdur Razzak, Enamul Haque Jr, Mohammed Rafique and Syed Rasel.
