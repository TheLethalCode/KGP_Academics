<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com)US Charg d'Affaires Geeta Pasi Tuesday said Bangladesh needed to allow trade unionism and protect the rights of workers in the readymade garment industry to get duty-free access to the US market. She also said that the US government was examining the request to review Bangladesh's eligibility for generalised system of preferences facilities. "Throughout the world, in all of our free-trade agreements, the US government position is consistent: the condition for special trade benefits (duty-free access) is the protection of worker rights and the freedom of association," Pasi said while speaking at the Cotton Council International Licence Award Ceremony at a hotel in Gulshan. She awarded Square Spinnings and Malek Spinning Mills for doing good business with the United States. "While it is true that Bangladesh is in a state of emergency, fundamental human rights should not be ignored. These rights include the rights of workers," Pasi said. "It is important that workers have the ability to constructively voice their views -- otherwise there is the real danger of worker dissatisfaction spilling into the streets." She said labour groups and apparel industry representatives in the United States sought to assist Bangladesh in protecting worker rights. "Labour rights are a key component of international trade today. The US government is studying a request made by a US labour organisation to review Bangladesh's eligibility for the generalised system of preferences, also known as the GSP," she said. "The GSP gives preferential tariffs to certain goods Bangladesh exports to the United States." The US government has been asking Bangladesh to allow trade unions in the readymade garment industry. The US trade representative (USTR) office had several hearings on violation of labour rights in the RMG sector. bdn
