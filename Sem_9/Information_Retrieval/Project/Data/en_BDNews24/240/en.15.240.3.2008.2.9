 ACCRA, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Factbox on Cameroon ahead of the African Nations Cup final against Egypt on Sunday: PAST RECORD Winners: 1984, 1988, 2000, 2002 Runners-up: 1986 Cameroon have missed just one of the last 13 Nations Cup finals tournament and seek to equal the record of five title wins set by Egypt last edition. FORM Cameroon suffered an embarrassing 4-2 defeat by Egypt at the start of Group C in Kumasi and were immediately written off but bounced back to score eight goals in their next two games against Zambia and Sudan.
