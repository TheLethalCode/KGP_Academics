<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com)  Arambagh KS Thursday moved into the final of the Proteeti Pharma Victory Day Football Tournament with a 2-0 win over Badda Jagaroni at Bangabandhu National Stadium. Liton and Iddi struck for Arambagh, who take on the winners between semifinalists Abahani and Mohammedan Sunday. Badda, who stunned Abahani 1-0 in tournament opener, were not up to the mark against Arambagh though they had better ball possession in the first half. Arambagh, who were fined after playing an unsporting match against Mohammedan, made the first move in the 21st minute, but Badda defender Rasel frustrated them clearing a goal-bound header of Akram. Badda's Nasir missed the day's easiest chance sending the ball over the crossbar in the 43rd minute despite getting Arambagh goalkeeper Nehal alone. Four minutes into the second half, Nehal foiled a Monu header for a corner, but Liton gave Arambagh a lead in the 80th minute with a header after capitalising on an Iddi cross. Iddi then sealed the match in the dying minute driving a Dominic pass home to throw Arambagh into the final. bdnew
