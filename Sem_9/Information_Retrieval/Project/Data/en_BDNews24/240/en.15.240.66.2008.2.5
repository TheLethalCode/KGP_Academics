 MOSCOW, Feb 5 (Reuters) - A Russian 'Progress' supply space ship was launched successfully from its platform in Kazakhstan on Tuesday, Russian news agencies reported. News agency TASS, citing Russia's mission control outside Moscow, said the cargo ship separated from its 'Soyuz-U' rocket 200km above Earth on a trajectory to meet with the International Space Station (ISS). Mission control said fresh food, including honey, fruit and vegetables, along with water and technical supplies for the ISS crew, was on board. US astronauts Peggy Whitson and Daniel Tani and Russian cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko are now on board the ISS.
