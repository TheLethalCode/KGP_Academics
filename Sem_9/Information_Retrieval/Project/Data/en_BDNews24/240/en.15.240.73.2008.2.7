 LONDON, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares fell early on Thursday, led by a decline in technology stocks after top network equipment maker Cisco issued a grim outlook and Infineon warned of continued losses at its phone chips unit.

Infineon shares fell by 7.5 percent following Cisco's warning of a rapid slowdown in U.S. and European orders after Wednesday's closing bell. Cisco shares fell by nearly 10.5 percent from their last close in Frankfurt to 14.54 euros.

"Cisco gave negative comments reporting their forecast so there is a negative mood spreading to the tech area in Europe.

By 0813 GMT the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.7 percent at 1,312.25 points. Declining issues outnumbered advancers by eight to one. Deutsche Bank shares were up 2.2 percent. Around Europe, London's FTSE 100 index fell 1 percent, while Frankfurt's DAX lost 0.6 percent and Paris' CAC 40 fell 0.9 perce
