 PARIS, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chad's President Idriss Deby urged the European Union on Thursday to send a peacekeeping force to his country as quickly as possible. The 27-nation EU suspended deployment of a 3,700-strong EUFOR mission to eastern Chad, meant to protect civilians from a spillover of violence from Darfur, when a column of rebels stormed the capital on Saturday and tried to overthrow Deby.

Deby said France had provided the Chadian army with training but had not directly intervened in the fighting. He said he was ready to pardon six French aid workers jailed for eight years for abducting children if France requested it. The incident, involving the aid group "Zoe's Ark" which said it had gone to Chad to help children orphaned in the conflict-torn Darfur region, aroused strong feelings last year but Deby said the situation had settled down. "I am ready to pardon them," he said, but only "if the government ask
