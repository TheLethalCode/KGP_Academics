 BANGALORE, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India is likely to import wheat for the third straight year in 2008, despite government estimates of a good crop, and volumes could be slightly higher than last year, a senior U.S. industry official said on Saturday. "In my opinion, they would need to import a little -- about two to three million tonnes," Mark Samson, vice president for South Asia of the U.S. Wheat Associates told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference in Bangalore. In 2006, India imported wheat for the first time in six years, buying about 5.5 million tonnes. It also imported 1.8 million tonnes last year to control prices and build up stocks. The Indian government has estimated that wheat output this year would be about 75 million tones, while the buffer stocks in April would be 5.3 million tonnes, against a targeted 4 million tonnes. "I think that the estimate of 75 million tones is at the very upper end. I think the potential is down, not up, for increased production," Samson said. Indian traders and government officials attending the conference have dismissed the possibility of plentiful imports this year, saying the new crop and the buffer stocks would be adequate for meeting local demand. Wheat in the domestic Indian market was currently quoted around 12 rupees a kg, while the landed cost of imports are expected to cost between 18 to 20 rupees a kg, as world prices have hit record highs, traders said.
