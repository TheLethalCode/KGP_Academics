<TITLE> Pakistan Taliban declare ceasefire: spokesman </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ISLAMABAD, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani Taliban fighters announced a ceasefire on Wednesday after months of clashes with security forces and suicide attacks across the northwest of the country. Military spokesmen were not immediately available for comment but security officials in South Waziristan said there have been contacts with militants in tribal strongholds of the Pakistani Taliban. "The government has shown leniency over the past four or five days," Maulvi Omar, a spokesman for Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or the Taliban Movement of Pakistan, told Reuters by telephone. "That's why we are declaring a ceasefire." Omar said the decision to call a ceasefire was taken at a shura, or council meeting, chaired by Baitullah Mehsud, the leader of the Pakistani Taliban and a prime suspect in the assassination of pro-Western opposition leader Benazir Bhutto in late December. Nearly 300 people have died in militant-related violence since the start of the year, including six killed on Monday when a suicide bomber rammed his motorcycle into a military bus near army headquarters in Rawalpindi, the garrison town next door to the capital, Islamabad. Growing insecurity has raised fears about nuclear-armed Pakistan's stability as it heads towards an election on Feb. 18 that was delayed after Bhutto's assassination. The Waziristan region is regarded as a sanctuary for al Qaeda and Taliban militants who fled there after US-led forces ousted them from Afghanistan in late 2001. Pakistani troops have been trying for years, with varying degrees of success, to clear these areas of militants, who also attack Western and Afghan government troops across the border.
