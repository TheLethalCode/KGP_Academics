 KOUSSERI, Cameroon, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Like thousands of people who fled a weekend rebel assault on the Chadian capital, Fatima Abdelrahim is hungry and thirsty but too scared to go home. Abdelrahim still bears the long, roughly-stitched scar where shrapnel tore through her arm when a mortar fell on her house the last time the rebels attacked N'Djamena in April 2006. This time she was luckier: her only injury a sprained ankle as she emerged from a wooden boat when she crossed the river. But with the remnants of the rebel force still inside Chad, some 600 km (375 miles) from the capital, she will not go back. "I can't go to N'Djamena," Abdelrahim told Reuters in the Cameroonian border town of Kousseri. Aid agencies reckon up to 60,000 Chadians crossed the river border after the weekend attack on N'Djamena. A few hundred crossed back into the capital at the urging of Chadian police on Wednesday, but most of them do not dare. Many thousands are living in school rooms, makeshift shelters or sleeping rough in Kousseri, where supplies are running short and refugees say they can ill-afford rocketing prices for food and drinking water. Many refugees are waiting for word from loved ones left behind in N'Djamena, where burnt-out pickups litter the streets and authorities are still collecting dead bodies. "We're waiting for peace. We have no information here, nothing," said Amina Agoni, sitting with her family in the dusty square in front of Kousseri's town hall. Two of her sons were badly burned when a mortar or rocket exploded in their house, but they have yet to receive treatment. Ten-year-old Abaka Abayah sat listlessly on the ground, congealed butter smeared over the exposed flesh of his knees where the blast burned his skin away. HELP Nearby, Nara Moustapha peered through her Muslim head dress and patted her large belly. Her baby is due in 10 days, she said in Arabic through an interpreter, and she wants help. Aid agencies have struggled to help refugees in Kousseri. Cameroon's main port, Douala, is over 1,700 km (1,050 miles) away. Many agencies have offices in N'Djamena but much of the city was damaged or looted, and some staff have left. Alfred Dono, a worker with medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) Spain who crossed from N'Djamena to assess humanitarian needs in Kousseri, said the main requirements were food, drinking water, mosquito nets and help for pregnant women. UN refugee agency UNHCR plans to send two plane loads of supplies for 14,000 people, spokesman Ron Redmond said. Prices for basic foods have shot up, with the cost of rice doubling since the crisis began, people in Kousseri said. To add to their problems, many Chadian workers did not get their January salary before they left. Huddled around a crackly transistor radio in the mud-built house they have borrowed from a Cameroonian resident, a group of Chadian men shook their heads as they listened to their prime minister telling them the rebels had been routed. Reassurances from France, which has forces in Chad, were not enough for Ousmane Adda, who wanted to see a delayed European peacekeeping force deploy in Chad before returning home. "There are no guarantees," said a relative, Hissene Adda.
