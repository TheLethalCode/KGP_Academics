 NAIROBI, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kenya's tourism sector could be close to a complete shutdown by year-end if the country's political impasse is not resolved soon, officials at the industry's regulatory body warned on Wednesday. The Kenya Tourist Board said the pace at which a team led by former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan resolves the deadlock would determine the survival of the industry, the country's leading foreign exchange earner. "Suppose nothing works out and we continue the way we were two weeks ago, the industry will be down by the end of December by almost 100 percent," Kennedy Manyalla, the board's director of research and development, told a news conference. So far at least 1,000 people have been killed and 304,000 displaced in the violence that flared after President Mwai Kibaki was sworn in on Dec. 30. Potential tourists have been put off by television images of killing and rioting in the East African country, and the tourist board has said that up to half of the 250,000 people it employs could be laid off as a result. The board said tourism earned about 65.4 billion Kenya shillings ($917.9 million) in 2007, up from 56.2 billion shillings in 2006. Industry officials say the impact of the latest violence is greater than after 1998 and 2002 bomb attacks and previous bouts of political unrest. The board had earlier forecast a total of 314,995 visitors in the first quarter, but now says it expects less than a tenth of that number, or around 27,000 visitors in that period. "Based on the projections, the expected loss will be 5.5 billion shillings on average per month in the first quarter," the board's managing director Ongong'a Achieng said. In the first quarter of 2007, Kenya received 501,817 visitors and earned 17.5 billion shillings. The board gave two scenarios for the sector if a political answer is quickly found. If the government maintains its present marketing budget -- around 700 million shillings in the 2007/08 fiscal year -- the industry would recover next year, Achieng said. But if the political stalemate is solved promptly and the government spends 1.5 billion shillings to help the sector, it would to start recovering in around October, KTB said. Visitor arrivals in 2007 stood at 2.0 million, up from 1.8 million in 2006, led by tourists from Britain, United States and Scandinavia.
