 BANGKOK, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thailand's new cabinet, packed with supporters of ousted prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, was sworn in by King Bhumibol Adulyadej on Wednesday, marking the return of elected government after a 2006 coup. Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej, who admitted before the Dec. 23 poll he was a proxy for Thaksin, doubled as defence minister -- a slap in the face for the generals who led the coup and an indicator of how low their political star has fallen. Other important posts went to top officials of the People Power Party (PPP), the successor to Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai (Thais Love Thais) party, banned after the coup for electoral fraud.

His comments raised the prospect of a revival of the protest movement that brought more than 100,000 people to the streets of Bangkok at its height to accuse Thaksin of being corrupt, abusive and disrespectful to the monarchy. Analysts say the protests and subsequent coup were also the Bangkok-based royalist and military elite reacting to the unprecedented power of Thaksin, an ethnic Chinese provincial billionaire whose popularity was built on lavish rural handouts. Thaksin has been cleared of any insult to the crown, but is facing one corruption charge relating to his wife's purchase of a prime piece of Bangkok real estate while in offi
