<TITLE> Rare voice of dissent sounds in Kazakhstan media </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ALMATY, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A leading Kazakh newspaper criticised this week's state of the nation address by President Nursultan Nazarbayev on Friday, a rare voice of dissent in the Central Asian state's tightly controlled media. Western media groups have accused Kazakhstan of silencing independent media in a country where television and newspapers almost never portray Nazarbayev in negative light. But in an unusually open critique of the veteran leader, who has ruled his ex-Soviet nation with an iron fist since 1989, the Delovaya Nedelya weekly attacked his speech as hypocritical. "The speech offered no answers to key questions," the privately owned paper wrote in a front-page story headlined 'Silence about the crucial". Its author was not identified. The weekly, which usually focuses on business news, said the 67-year-old leader largely ignored bread-and-butter issues such as crumbling Soviet-era infrastructure, safety at coal mines and problems in the banking sector stemming from global credit woes. In his speech on Wednesday, Nazarbayev ordered his government to cut spending to tame inflation, raise its weight in the oil sector and urged his people to save electricity. The paper reported that as Nazarbayev spoke, a queue of 4,000 people outside a government building in the financial capital Almaty turned into a mass stampede as people raced to sign up to a state housing programme in subzero temperatures. "With those pictures in the background, the president would have looked very different compared to when he is surrounded by well-fed and happy deputies, senators and ministers," it said. Nazarbayev tightened his grip on power last year by seizing the right to remain in office for life and holding a snap parliamentary election which handed his political party all the seats. Western monitors criticised that election as flawed. The opposition is weak and fragmented. Two opposition leaders have been killed in Kazakhstan since 2005, the year Nazarbayev was re-elected with 91 percent of the vote. More loyal media, however, praised Nazarbayev's speech. "The loudest standing ovation was given when the president said that stability, peace and accord were needed to further strengthen the state, its security, economic growth and rising living standards," wrote the Liter newspap
