 Dhaka, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com)UK foreign secretary David Miliband Friday spoke to a group of young professionals and politicians who shared thoughts on the political situation in the shadows of emergency rule in Bangladesh. Attending a discussion meeting on "Future of Bangladesh" with the UK minister at the British Council auditorium, one of the participants said "de-politicisation" was going on in the name of political reforms and that such an imposition might have adverse effects. Some of them said the once-popular anticorruption crackdown morphed into an "anti-politics" move. But all of them, precisely 10, agreed that Bangladesh did not want to go back to confrontational politics and wanted to exploit the full potential of being an important country in Asia. The UK foreign secretary told the media that the future of Bangladesh was bright and that the existing relations between Bangladesh and the UK would be cemented further. Miliband was appointed as the youngest foreign secretary for the UK at the age of 41 since David Owen was appointed in 1977 at 38. "De-politicisation is now going on in the name reforms," Zayed Almer Khan, managing editor of New Age, said while expressing his views on the existing political situation in the country. "Democracy is extremely important. Institutional development is necessary instead of imposition," he said. Miliband's meeting with young civil society members came a day before his scheduled meeting with chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Saturday. Miliband is set to hold a wrap-up press conference at the British high commissioner's home, starting at 5.30 pm Saturday. "People welcomed the anticorruption drive, but that move has turned into an anti-politics move," Dr Dipu Moni, women affairs secretary of the Awami League, said at the discussion meeting. "Replacing some person is no democracy," she said. Mahi B Chowdhury of Bikalpa Dhara Bangladesh said that 90 percent of the voters wanted general elections, but none of them wanted to return to the politics of confrontation. Zahir Uddin Swapan, former MP from the BNP, said the political system grew without checks and balances during the last 15 years of parliamentary democracy. Ifty Islam, founder and managing partner of Asian Tiger Capital Partners, a private equity and venture capital institution, told the meeting that Bangladesh had all potential to be one of the "emerging tigers" in Asia. He underlined the need for more foreign direct investment in Bangladesh for further growth. bdn
