 LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Feb 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tornadoes and thunderstorms ravaged several states in the American South overnight, killing at least 26 people, injuring dozens and causing widespread damage, emergency services and local media said. The violent storms swept across Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky and Mississippi, overturning trucks, trapping people, ripping up houses, smashing cars, and uprooting trees. By early Wednesday morning, the city of New Orleans and the states of Alabama and Georgia were also under tornado warning. Two of the states hit by the tornadoes -- Arkansas and Tennessee -- were involved in "Super Tuesday" as a total of 24 states across the country held nominating contests ahead of November's presidential election. Several candidates expressed condolences to the victims as they addressed supporters and there were media reports that at least four polling stations in western Tennessee were closed because of the storm. At least 12 people were killed in Tennessee, according to the Nashville Tennessean newspaper's online edition. The roof of a warehouse collapsed in Memphis, killing at least three, while northeast of Nashville, a massive fire erupted at a gas station with flames shooting up 500 feet (152 meters) in the air, the paper said on its Web site. In Arkansas, emergency services reported 11 dead after tornadoes hit as many as eight counties. "It's a pretty rough night in the scope of it.

CNN reported as many as 86 injuries and an unknown number of fatalities from the storm system, which swept through Arkansas before moving into Tennessee.

The Jackson Sun reported that a nursing home had been seriously damaged but the 114 residents were evacuated with no injuries reported. The Nashville Tennessean newspaper, citing the Fayette County Sheriff's Department, said one man had been found dead north of Somerville, Tennessee.
