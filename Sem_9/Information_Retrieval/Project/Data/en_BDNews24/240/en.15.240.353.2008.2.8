<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court Thursday deferred to Feb 10 the hearing on government appeal against Wednesday's High Court verdict cancelling the Azam J Chowdhury extortion case against Hasina. A six-member Appellate Division bench headed by acting chief justice Md Fazlul Karim deferred the hearing after Hasina's lawyer requested more time. Hasina's advocate on record Moulvi Wahidullah asked for a day's adjournment as barrister Rafiq Ul Haque, the accused's senior lawyer, was not present. Attorney general barrister Fida M Kamal said the plaintiff had no objection to the court adjourning the hearing. The court ordered the case proceedings adjourned until Sunday. Additional attorney general Salahuddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com that the government made no objection to the defendant's request for time because it did not want any issues to emerge. He added that though the chamber judge had set Thursday for hearing the appeal, the case was somehow excluded from the regular daily list of hearings for the day. The court still included the case for hearing Thursday and Hasina's lawyers were notified of the development, Salahuddin said. On Feb 6, the High Court cancelled the extortion case against Hasina after ruling illegal the transfer of the case for trial under the emergency powers rules. The case filed on June 13 charges the former prime minister and her cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim with extorting Tk 3 crore from businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury during Hasina's 1996-2001 term in exchange for a contract to build a power plant. Hasina was arrested on July 16. The case was brought under emergency rules the following day when she was shown arrested in the case. On July 24, a charge sheet was submitted to the court that included Hasina's sister Sheikh Rehana as co-accused. bdnews24.
