 Sylhet, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission Thursday filed a case against Sylhet City mayor Badar Uddin Ahmed Kamran and wife Asma Kamran for amassing wealth illegally. Nasir Uddin, deputy director of the ACC, filed the case with Kotwali Police Station against the two, Kotwali police chief Khandaker Nawroz Ahmed told bdnews24.com. According to case details, the mayor acquired wealth worth Tk 2.16 crore illegally by misusing his power. He concealed the information from the ACC in his wealth statement submitted to the graft watchdog, the case alleges. Kamran submitted accounts of his moveable and immovable property around Tk 2.45 crore on Sept 11 last year to the ACC as it had sent him notice seeking his wealth statement. Earlier the ACC filed a case against the mayor on charges of corruption in leasing out kitchen markets. On April 5 last year, an arrest warrant was issued against him and he was arrested the next day. Kamran, however, got bail in that case. On May 28, joint forces rearrested him. The High Court on Jan 31 ruled that his detention order was illegal. He is now in Comilla jail, facing another case filed under the Narcotics Act. bdnews24.com/c
