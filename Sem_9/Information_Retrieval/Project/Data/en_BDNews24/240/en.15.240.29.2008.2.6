 Brussels, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Commission said on Tuesday it was concerned violence in Chad's capital could disrupt aid deliveries in the east of the country, saying deploying a delayed EU force was vital to keep aid flowing. The 27-nation bloc had planned to start deploying the 3,700-strong EUFOR mission to eastern Chad last Friday to protect civilians from a spillover of violence from Darfur and ensure that aid groups could work there.

EU diplomats say the suspension of the mission is temporary and the bloc aims at launching it as soon as possible. They give no date, saying this depends on the situation on the ground. The EU executive announced on Tuesday 2 million euros ($2.96 million) of emergency aid to provide food and clean water to Chadians who have taken refuge in Cameroon to flee the violence. "Chad faces being hemmed in by humanitarian crises both in the east and in the west as many civilians flee N'Djamena into neighbouring Cameroon," Clancy said.
