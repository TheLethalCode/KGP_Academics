<TITLE> Armed forces pay to rise 2.6 percent </TITLE>

 LONDON, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Members of the armed forces are to receive a 2.6 percent pay rise from April, Defence Secretary Des Browne announced on Thursday. He said the government had accepted the recommendations of the independent Armed Forces' Pay Review Body and would implement them in full. Browne said the rise was consistent with the government's 2 percent Consumer Prices Index inflation target. It follows a 2.45 percent rise to be paid to teachers from September but comes after the government prompted a dispute with police after refusing to pay in full last year a recommended 2.5 percent pay deal. Both the armed services and the police are unable to strike and have their pay determined by an independent tribunal. Police have won permission to launch a High Court challenge to the government's decision to stage their award, effectively reducing it to a 1.9 percent rise. Prime Minster Gordon Brown's spokesman said "difficult decisions" had to be made last year over public sector pay to keep inflation under control. "The government continues to believe the need to be disciplined in relation to public sector pay," he added. The pay offers are all below the Retail Price Index -- at present 4 percent -- on which most private sector pay deals are based. As well as its acrimonious dispute with police over pay, the government also faces a possible battle with some teachers. The National Union of Teachers is balloting members for what would be the first national walkout over pay for two decades. The Department of Work and Pensions, Transport, Home Office and the Crown Prosecution Service are also all in varying degrees of industrial action or negotiations over pay and conditions.
