Dhaka, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court Thursday deferred till Feb 13 the hearing of a corruption case filed by the Anticorruption Commission accusing Sheikh Hasina of illegally awarding contracts for three barge-mounted power plants. Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina was produced in the court set up in the Sangsad Bhaban premises at 9:50 am. Co-accused Toufique-e-Elahi Chowdhury was brought in soon after. Judge Md Feroz Alam of Special Judge's Court-1 deferred the hearing till Feb 13 after the prosecution lawyers appealed for more time. The proceedings were transferred on Jan 28 to the Special Judges' Court-1 set up on the Sangsad Bhaban premises. According to case details, the accused took bribes of around Tk 3 crore in exchange for awarding contracts to two companies to set up three power plants at Haripur, Shikalbaha and Khulna. ACC deputy director SM Shabbir Khan filed the case with Tejgaon Police Station on Sept 2. The other accused persons are former power secretary, Toufique-e-Elahi Chowdhury, former chairman of the Power Development Board Nuruddin Mahmud Kamal, Summit Group directors Md Aziz Khan and Farid Khan, United Group directors Hasan Mahmud Raja and Abul Kalam Azad and curator of the Bangabandhu Memorial Museum Syed Siddikur Rahman. All of the accused have been shown fugitives except Hasina and Elahi. Hasina was shown arrested on Sep 19 last year while Elahi turned himself in to the court on Jan 16. The ACC accused Hasina of receiving Tk 3 crore in bribes between Oct 24, 1996 and Nov 24, 1997, through eight cheques and pay orders, during her 1996-2001 term in office. The case alleged that the former prime minister purchased 19 kathas of land, including a two-storey building on Road No 32, Dhanmondi, in the name of the Bangabandhu Memorial Trust in 1997. The owners of Summit Group and United Group were involved in the land deal payment. The police pressed charges on Jan 10, adding the curator of the Bangabandhu Memorial Trust to the list of accused in the charge-sheet. On Nov 4, the High Court cleared the former prime minister of the charge and stayed all proceedings of the case, after Hasina had challenged the legality of bringing the case under emergency powers rules. The Supreme Court on Nov 26 overturned the High Court order, clearing way for the case proceedings to continue to trial. bd
