 PARIS (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - Societe Generale (SocGen) was braced for fresh criticism from France's top central banker on Tuesday as the man the bank blames for its record trading losses spoke out against his former employer. Bank of France governor Christian Noyer, who last week said he warned SocGen less than a year ago to improve its market control systems, prepared to address parliament on the trading scandal that has humbled the French bank. On January 24, SocGen unveiled 4.9 billion euros ($7.3 billion) of losses which it said were caused by rogue deals executed by Jerome Kerviel, a 31-year old junior trader at the French bank. Kerviel is under police investigation and on Tuesday he told French news agency Agence France Presse (AFP) that he would not be turned into a "scapegoat". "I take my share of the responsibility but I will not be turned into a scapegoat of Societe Generale," he was quoted as saying. Kerviel was questioned again by magistrates for eight hours on Monday, a judicial source told Reuters, and he faces possible criminal charges. French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said on Monday the trading debacle highlighted major failings in SocGen's systems. She said France would seek stricter risk controls for financial institutions and impose far tougher penalties on banks that failed to police them effectively. BID TALK LINGERS SocGen shares were down 1.3 percent at 82.50 euros in mid-afternoon trade, giving it a stock market value of around 38 billion euros. As a result of the trading losses, the bank plans a 5.5 billion euro capital increase that has been fully underwritten by JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley. Analysts expect SocGen to detail a rights issue later this week. The trading losses, which will cause a slump in SocGen's annual profits, have turned SocGen into a likely takeover target. U.S. investment bank Merrill Lynch said in a research report on Tuesday that it saw a 70 percent chance of a takeover of SocGen. Merrill raised its price target on SocGen to 116 euros from 90 euros and reiterated a "buy" rating on SocGen shares. The Merrill Lynch research report also said a takeover of SocGen could come in the form of a break-up consortium, involving French banks BNP Paribas and Credit Agricole with Italy's Intesa Sanpaolo. BNP Paribas narrowly failed to buy SocGen in 1999. France's top politicians have repeatedly expressed their determination to ensure that SocGen avoids falling prey to a hostile takeover bid by a foreign ban
