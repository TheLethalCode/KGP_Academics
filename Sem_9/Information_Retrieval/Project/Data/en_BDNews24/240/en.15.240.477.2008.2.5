<TITLE> Bosnia's internal quarrels block path to EU </TITLE>

 SARAJEVO, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bosnia will be unable to sign its first formal accord with the European Union in the near future because rival ethnic leaders continue to block reforms, diplomats and analysts said. Muslim, Serb and Croat politicians were expected this month to make good on last year's promise to reform Bosnia's ethnically separate police forces, a pledge which led the EU to initial a Stabilisation and Association Agreement. But a weekend meeting revealed that deep divisions remain. Sulejman Tihic, head of the main Muslim party, withdrew his support for the police reform deal and the Bosnian Serbs opposed strengthening the central government because that would weaken the authority of their own autonomous region. International peace envoy Miroslav Lajcak said ethnic bickering and narrow party agendas were threatening Bosnia's European course. "I think the chance the SAA may be signed by the end of the Slovenian (EU) presidency has now definitely failed," Lajcak said this week, referring to the end of June. "If local authorities continue with such behaviour, the international community will have to take action." Under the Dayton peace accords that ended the 1992-95 war, Bosnia is made up of two autonomous regions, the Serb Republic and the Muslim-Croat federation. Lajcak accused the main Bosnian Serb and Muslim parties of putting their interests above the interests of their citizens. Analyst Ivan Barbalic said the latest developments showed there was no real will among politicians for reforms or compromise. "Tihic was only the first to take off the mask," Barbalic told Reuters. "It is now clear that there is no consensus on important issues in the ruling coalition." The two region's coexistence in a unitary state has been marred by mutual suspicion, accusations and a resistance to reforms that are regarded by each as favouring the other side. Resentments boiled over in November when the ethnic Serb prime minister of the central government quit in protest at a proposal he viewed as attacking the autonomy of the Serbs. Worried by the prospect of ethnic tensions paralysing Bosnia after 12 years of international supervision and billions of dollars in aid, the West piled on the pressure. Bosnian leaders reached a conciliatory deal after a month of recriminations and were rewarded with the initialling of the SAA. Signing was conditional on them actually implementing the long-delayed reforms. "It is unacceptable that politicians who had signed something and gave assurances to the commissioner (Olli Rehn) are no longer doing it," Doris Pack of the European Parliament told reporters on Tuesday in Sarajevo. Bosnia, along with neighbouring Serbia, are the only countries in the region that have not signed an SAA, the first rung on the ladder to eventual membership of the EU.
