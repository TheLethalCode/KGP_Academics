 Dhaka, Feb 06 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court Wednesday sentenced Md Shamsul Karim Talukdar, a postal department official, to six months in jail and fined him Tk 20,000 for misappropriating Tk 2 lakh. Failure to pay the fine would result in his spending another month in jail. Justice Shamsunnahar Begum of the Special Judge's Court-4 set up on the Sangsad Bhaban premises handed down the verdict. The verdict said that the court showed leniency while awarding punishment to the convict, an official posted at the Bangladesh Secretariat post office, as he had refunded the misappropriated amount. Simultaneously, the court also ordered the Anticorruption Commission to take punitive action against its assistant director Sheikh Abdus Salam and investigation officer Md Shamsul Alam for mishandling their investigative roles in the case. On Nov 18, 2007, the convicted postal official surrendered in the court and hence his detention tenure would be adjusted with the jail term to shorten it. On Jan 31, the judge after hearing the arguments of both the state and the defence set the verdict date. On April 17, 2007, ACC assistant director Sheikh Abdus Salam filed the graft case with Ramna police station. The case details said that Talukdar had misappropriated Tk 1.37 lakh collected in car tax from Oct 21, 2003 to Oct 12, 2004. At the same time, he embezzled another Tk 91,000 by delivering 20 fake tax tokens. Charges in the case were framed on Nov 14 and witnesses' depositions were recorded starting Nov 18. A total of eight government witnesses testified in the case. bdnews24
