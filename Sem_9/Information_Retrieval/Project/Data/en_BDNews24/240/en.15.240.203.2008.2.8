 TOKYO, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japanese shares fell 1.4 percent on Friday after surprisingly weak machinery orders data stirred worries over the economy's health, while Australian equities pushed higher as investors were lured back into battered bank stocks. European stocks were poised to track overnight gains on Wall Street, with bookmakers seeing Britain's FTSE 100 up 35 to 46 points at the open and Germany's DAX rising 56 to 70 points. Trading activity in Asia was subdued due to the Lunar New Year holidays in most of the region. Markets in China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia were all closed until next week. Japanese government bonds (JGBs) got a boost from the drop in domestic stocks, while US Treasuries clawed back from a sell-off the day before when a poor auction of 30-year bonds drove long-term yields up by the most in four years. The dollar was steady against the euro, holding gains from the previous day after European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet acknowledged risks to the growth outlook, stoking expectations for interest rate cuts later in the year. Investors now see the ECB following the Federal Reserve and Bank of England in cutting rates after having kept them steady the previous day at 4.0 percent, with the threat of a global economic slowdown rising. "The ECB will probably trim interest rates by the end of March," said Akira Takei, a portfolio manager who oversees about 250 billion yen ($2.3 billion) of foreign bonds at Mizuho Asset Management in Tokyo. Takei said he is favouring European bonds over Treasuries in the near-term on expectations for a ECB rate cut, while betting for the dollar to rise more against the euro. Despite weaker stocks and worries about the economic outlook, commodity prices were higher. Platinum prices hovered near their record of $1,850 an ounce hit the previous day, while U.S. crude oil rose 75 cents to $88.86 a barrel on forecasts for colder weather in the northeastern United States. Japan's benchmark Nikkei stock index fell as investors sold firms such as industrial robot maker Fanuc Ltd following the machinery orders drop. For the week, the Nikkei lost 3.6 percent and has yet to post a weekly rise since the start of the year. Japan's broader TOPIX index also fell 1.4 percent. Japanese financial markets will be closed on Monday for a national holiday. Australian shares rose 1.1 percent as investors returned to banks such as Commonwealth Bank of Australia following overnight gains in U.S. stocks. On Thursday, the S&P 500 rose 0.8 percent. G7 IN TOKYO The dollar dipped a touch against the yen to 107.35 yen from around 107.50 yen in late U.S. trade. The euro was steady at around $1.4470 and is poised to post its biggest one-week drop in 1- years. Investors are now awaiting comments from Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers arriving in Tokyo for their meeting on Saturday. No major change is expected in the G7's stance on exchange rates, calling for more flexibility from China. Instead, the focus is on policy solutions to any global economic slowdown as the U.S. economy appears to teeter on the edge of a recession. Bank of Japan Governor Toshihiko Fukui told parliament on Friday that the risks of a global economic slowdown are rising. "Ministers have more serious issues to talk about than currency markets this time," said Haruhisa Takagi, head of forex spot trading at Sumitomo Mitsui Bank. "Meanwhile, the market remains concerned about further fallout from the credit market crisis and the euro is becoming a new victim as euro zone economies seem to be slowly being dragged down by the US economic downturn." In bonds, the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond yield dipped 1 basis point to 1.415 percent. Ten-year Treasuries rose 11/32 in price to yield 3.730 percent, down 4 basis points from US trade. Gold was little changed at $909.25 an ounce after Thursday's news that producers were reducing their hedge books. Other commodities posted strong gains. Chicago wheat futures hit a record high on tight supplies and strong demand, while corn and soy prices climbed. Crude oil prices rose 75 cents to $88.87 a barrel on expectations that colder US weather would boost fuel demand and after prices failed to break below the $86 watermark this we
