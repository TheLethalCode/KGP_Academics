 DURBAN, South Africa, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Disagreement between South Africa's selectors and administrators has delayed naming the squad to tour Bangladesh this month. The list of players was due to be decided in a teleconference on Tuesday but the announcement was deferred after Cricket South Africa (CSA) president Norman Arendse refused to approve the selectors' decision. "If two of the players selected for Bangladesh are not fit and will undergo fitness tests on Monday, why don't we wait until Monday before we announce the squad?" Arendse told Reuters on Wednesday. Arendse said he was referring to batsman Neil McKenzie, who tore a calf muscle in the second test against West Indies in Cape Town last month, and fast bowler Andre Nel, who has been struggling with a sore neck. Arendse denied reports that he wanted two players who were apparently not in the squad, opening batsman Herschelle Gibbs and fast bowler Monde Zondeki, to be included. "At no stage did I say I'm insisting on Gibbs and Zondeki," Arendse said. "I did not mention their names." TRUE BLUE Gibbs and Zondeki are black while McKenzie and Nel are white but Arendse said race was not an issue in the disagreement. "I'm a true blue cricket person," Arendse said. "I hate losing as much as anyone else, and I'm not going to insist on a player's inclusion on the grounds of colour." However, he also said that he had a mandate to ensure that South Africa's racially based selection policies were upheld. "My role is to ensure that the CSA transformation policy is complied with," Arendse said. "That may seem controversial to some people, but it remains the policy of CSA." South Africa coach Mickey Arthur, who is on the selection panel, said he wanted his strongest team on the field in Bangladesh as preparation for the tour of India that follows. "As a coach and a selector I share Norman's determination to push the transformation agenda but, at the same time, I want to be able to look every player in the eye and tell him: 'I believe you're the best player for this position'," Arthur told Reuter
