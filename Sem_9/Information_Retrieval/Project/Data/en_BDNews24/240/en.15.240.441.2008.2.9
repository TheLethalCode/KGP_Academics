<TEXT>
 BAGHDAD, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The head of Iraq's main Sunni Arab bloc said on Saturday the bloc had agreed to rejoin the Shia-led government, but other senior officials said no final decision had been made. "The Accordance Front has decided to return to the government. The results of the negotiations with the government have been positive," Adnan al-Dulaimi, the head of the bloc, told Reuters. But Salim al-Jubouri, spokesman for the Front and a senior lawmaker, said: "This is not true information. Negotiations are still going on. We have made good progress but we are still waiting for some things to be settled." Another senior bloc official also said no final decision had been made. The Front pulled its six ministers out of the cabinet of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in August, plunging the government into crisis. The bloc has been demanding greater Sunni Arab representation in government and the military, and a greater say in security matters.
