 PARIS, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Nicolas Sarkozy promised an extra 4,000 police to fight a "merciless war" against gangs and drug traffickers in France's poor suburbs, many of which have faced sporadic violence since riots in 2005. Sarkozy's plan to regenerate the ethnically diverse neighbourhoods of high-rise housing blocks is a response to the weeks of youth violence and scenes of burning cars that made headlines three years ago and have occasionally flared up since. "We will put an end to the law of gangs, silence and trafficking," Sarkozy told local leaders as he unveiled the plan, which follows on proposals by urban policy minister Fadela Amara, a civil rights activist and one of several left-wing figures in the government. He promised 500 million euros ($724.6 million) to improve transport links with difficult areas to allow the "rapid deghettoization of particularly isolated neighbourhoods", which are often cut off from city centres even though they are geographically close. He also promised more job opportunities and special training contracts to help young people find employment, and plans to send children to schools in different areas to ensure a good social mix. Sarkozy unveiled his plan just ahead of municipal elections on March 9 and 16. His popularity has plummeted since the beginning of the year and his party fears it will pay for this in the polls. Voters' main concern is a feeling of lost spending power, and they say he has concentrated more on his private life with new wife Carla Bruni, rather than helping them out. Sarkozy stood beside Amara, the daughter of poor Algerian immigrants and founder of the group "Ni Putes, Ni Soumises" (Neither Whores, Nor Submissives"), as he revealed his plan. He said he would not stand for discrimination and urged the country's elite institutions, such as the Henri IV high school or the ENA civil servant training school, to be more diverse. But Sarkozy, who was a hardline interior minister at the time of the 2005 riots, also said the state could not help those living in poverty who were not willing to help themselves. "Those who don't want to do anything, the state will not do anything for them," he said. Sarkozy's uncompromising position with the mostly young rioters when he was interior minister and his pledge to clean them out with a steamblaster generated deep hostility among many in the suburbs and he has rarely returned. In January, he made his first visit to an impoverished suburb since he was elected last May and met and talked to several young people. Sarkozy on Friday continued to take a tough line with those refusing to respect French culture and way of life. "There is no place in France for polygamy, genital mutilation, arranged marriages, veils in school and hatred of France," he sa
