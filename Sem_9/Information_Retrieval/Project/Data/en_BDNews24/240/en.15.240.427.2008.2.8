 ISMAILIYA, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Egypt has detained hundreds of Egyptians suspected of attempting to join the Islamist movement Hamas in Gaza after the coastal strip's border with Egypt was opened last month, security sources said on Friday. Egyptian authorities were holding about 600 Egyptians in a school in the border town of Rafah pending investigations of their activities in Gaza. Egypt allowed hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to cross into the Sinai peninsula last month after Hamas militants blew holes in the border to defy an Israeli-led blockade of the Palestinian territory. Egypt re-sealed the border on Sunday. Egypt is wary of too much contact with Gaza because of the close ties between Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's largest opposition group. Some Egyptians had crossed into Gaza and sought to join Hamas but had returned to Egypt after the group turned down their help, the security sources said. They said a total of about 20,000 Egyptians had crossed into Gaza after the border was opened, most of them to buy or sell goods or to visit relatives. Egypt had closed its border crossing with Gaza after Hamas seized control of the strip in June. The government warned Palestinians on Thursday against trying to break through the border. "Whoever breaks the border line will have his foot broken," Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit said in comments carried by the state-run Middle East News Agency.
