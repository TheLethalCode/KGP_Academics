<TITLE> Tigers ready to take advantage of wicket against SA </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh are looking forward to doing better against South Africa taking the home advantage of a slow and turning wicket. South Africa, scheduled to arrive here on Feb 14, will play a two Test and three-ODI series against hosts Bangladesh in February-March. "We hope the boys will do better if we can provide our usual wicket (slow and turning)," chief selector Rafiqul Alam told reporters during the sixth and last practice match at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium Wednesday. "We saw that they faced problem on a turning wicket during the ICC World Cup in the West Indies, and I believe our players will do better against them on such a wicket at home," said Alam. The chief selector believes playing on low and slow wicket can lessen the difference between two Test nations. "They are number two at both one-dayer and Test ranking and we are at the bottom in Test, and I believe the difference between us with regard to performance will lessen if the boys can take the match to the fourth or the fifth day on such wicket." Alam expressed satisfaction over the practice matches the national cricketers performance in the last six days. "It is good for the boys, whatever they practised. Batsmen Junaed (Siddique), (Mohammad) Ashraful, Shakib (Al Hasan) and (Habibul) Bashar did well in the practice match as did the bowlers." "However, the batsmen should have stayed in the middle as long as they could, but I can say the overall practice was good for the boys," said Alam. Some 39 players, split into three groups, played six practice matches and the scores hardly crossed the 200-mark. Bangladesh captain Ashraful also echoed the chief selector and supported play on a slow and turning wicket against South Africa. "South Africa fell into trouble against us on slow wicket in Guyana and I think we can put them in trouble again playing on such a wicket at home," said Ashraful. Ashraful hopes they will be able to fight against South Africa neck-and-neck if some runs come from the middle order batsmen, shaky during the New Zealand tour. The Bangladesh captain believes 240 to 250 runs are enough to defend the total on the slow wicket. The reality is that the middle order batsmen, except Shakib, continued their shaky performances also in practice matches. "It is tough to play strokes and get runs on such a wicket, but we would have benefited had we played the practice matches a bit well," said Ashraful. Australian coach Jamie Siddons, however, wants to see the players getting better whatever the wicket. He also said that the players should take the Test to the fifth day playing better cricket. The Tigers will rest for the next two days and return to the nets from Saturday.
