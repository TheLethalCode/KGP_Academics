<TITLE> Fourth subsea cable break sparks conspiracy theories </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Martyn Warwick London, Feb 7 (telecomtv.com/bdnews24.com)  Goldfinger, the villain in the James Bond thriller of the same name, had a maxim. It was: Once is happenstance, twice is coincidence, the third time is enemy action. Now after four breakages in just five days on different cables close by and serving the Middle East have caused severe disruption, a flurry of conspiracy theories are being expounded on the web and even in the more traditional media. SEA-ME-WE 4 and FLAG Europe-Asia were severed last Wednesday off the Egyptian port of Alexandria while the FALCON system was cut in the Persian Gulf between the United Arab Emirates and Oman. A fourth incident was reported late on Sunday. It involves a (so-far) unnamed submarine link but reputable sources tell me it is the FALCON cable that has been hit for a second time. In this incident communications between Qatar and the United Arab Emirates has been affected. The peculiar series of cuts caused either serious service degradation or complete outage for Internet users across the Middle East and also in India, although traffic was gradually, but moderately quickly, restored on alternative cable systems and routes. The Indian operator VSNL said it managed to get the majority of its customers' IP traffic back online within 24 hours of the Wednesday cuts. The close proximity of the cut cables and the obvious and immediate impact they had on key economies of the Middle East has led to fevered speculation on the just how so many could happen so quickly and so close together. Adding to the mystery are the online news reports saying the Egyptian transport ministry has retracted its earlier explanation  that a slipping ship's anchor caused the damage to the two cables off Alexandria  after reviewing onshore video footage of the area at the time the outages happened. Meanwhile, the official statement says, "The Ministry's Maritime Transport Committee reviewed footage covering the period of 12 hours before and 12 hours after the cables were cut and no ships sailed the area. The area is also marked on maps as a no-go zone and it is therefore ruled out that the damage to the cables was caused by shipping." As might be expected, in online postings on sites such as Slashdot blame for the outages is being laid at the feet of both the US Secret Service and Islamic fundamentalists. Some say that the breakages were caused as mysterious agencies attempted to install wiretaps on the cable systems and several of the more exercised bloggers claim the cuts are a prelude to US military action in the area. Meanwhile, others say the events are either in retribution for or are a warning about the inauguration of the Iranian Oil Bourse that is due to open before 11 February. The Iranian Oil Bourse will allow oil to be traded in currencies other than the US dollar, and according to some experts, could significantly undermine the value and utility of the ubiquitous greenback. Yet others claim the cuts were part of experiments in information warfare designed to gauge the effects of such disruptions  again as a prelude to military actions. However, exciting as these speculative imaginings are, they fail to note is that the US military is among the largest consumers of bandwidth in the region, and, despite its undoubted access to sophisticated satellite communication technology, would surely have felt the impact of the outages along with the hundreds of millions of corporate and consumer users. A spokesperson for FLAG, the organisation that owns of two of the three named cables that were cut, says the company is still trying to determine the causes of the disruptions but adds that he does not believe FLAG cables were specifically targeted. Flag is owned by India's Reliance Group. However, Colonel R.S. Parihar, the Secretary of the Internet Service Providers Association of India, commented, "This has been an eye-opener for us, and everyone in the telecom industry worldwide. Today, the cause of the problem might perhaps have been an anchor but what if it is sabotage tomorrow?. These are owned by private operators, and there are no governments or armies protecting these cables." The main problem is that in their current configuration, subsea systems run through so-called "choke points"  areas where several cables are located very close together such as off Singapore and the coast of Egypt. Indeed, the industry got an earlier wake-up call back in 2006 when an earthquake off Taiwan caused massive disruption to cable-based broadband and telecoms services to many parts of Asia, in some cases for several months, Operators have since been looking at ways to diversify the routes of next generation cables. Submarine cables carry about 95 per cent of global telephone and Internet traffic and data passed over them travels considerably faster and more cheaply than it does over satellite.
