 Dhaka, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com)The government claims that the bird-flu situation is under control although the virus has rampaged through 37 districts. The chief adviser's special assistant Manik Lal Samaddar, who is in charge of the fisheries and livestock ministry, told reporters Wednesday that the government had total control over the situation. "There is nothing to panic. The government has taken all necessary measures to tackle the situation," he said. Samaddar said the avian virus (H5N1) had been detected in 116 farms in 37 districts as well as in the capital from March last year through the first week of February. "About 4.61 lakh birds and 4.48 lakh eggs of 179 poultry farms have been destroyed so far," he said. Samaddar said the virus was detected in 68 farms in 20 districts from March to December last year. In January alone, the virus attacked 32 farms in 12 districts, the CA's special aide said explaining the trend of infections. The discovery of the virus led to the culling of about 71,000 poultry birds in January alone. "And in the first five days of February, it spread to 16 farms in seven other districts, including two eastern districts," he added. Asked if the situation was severe, Samaddar said: "It did not happen in a day, the virus had spread over time." He elaborated the measures the government had taken to stop the spread of the virus. "Antiviral drugs are being sprayed at 12 points throughout the country and at entry points to the districts," he said. Samaddar asked everybody to cook chicken and eggs wellbefore eatingto avoid being infected. Samaddar also spoke about an increase in compensations to farm owners for every bird culled.
