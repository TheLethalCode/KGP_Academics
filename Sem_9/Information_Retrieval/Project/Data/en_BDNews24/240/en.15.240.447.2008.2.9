<TITLE> Germany to boost Afghan troop contingent </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Berlin, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The German government is planning to expand the number of soldiers it can send to Afghanistan by 1,000 to 4,500 and broaden their base of operation from the north to the west, Der Spiegel weekly reported on Saturday. Without citing its sources, Der Spiegel said German Chancellor Angela Merkel planned to make the proposal at a NATO summit in April. The magazine said the measure was designed to deflect pressure from the United States to send German forces to the more dangerous south. Asked about the report, a spokesman for the German Defence Ministry noted that a parliamentary mandate, which puts an upper limit of German forces at 3,500, was valid until mid-October. "Everything else is speculation," spokesman Thomas Raabe said. Germany is coming under increasing pressure from Washington to shift troops from the north to the south of Afghanistan to help a fierce battle against Taliban insurgents. Der Spiegel said Merkel's government aimed to extend the German parliamentary mandate by 15 to 18 months instead of the usual one-year period in order to keep the issue out of the next federal election due in the autumn of 2009. Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) and the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), partners in an uneasy "grand coalition", have so far resisted pressure to relocate troops to the south -- a move that polls show a solid majority of Germans oppose. The German troops are part of the 40,000-strong NATO International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan
