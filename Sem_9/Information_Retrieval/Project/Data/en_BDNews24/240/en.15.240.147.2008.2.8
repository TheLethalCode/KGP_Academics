<TITLE> "Tsar" Putin uses Kremlin's power to define future </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - He is often likened to a Tsar so perhaps it wasn't surprising that Vladimir Putin deployed the full imperial power of the Kremlin to present his political testament on Friday. The top echelon of Russian society were summoned to the Kremlin's vast and magnificent St. George Hall -- originally part of the Tsars' Moscow residence -- to hear the presidential vision of how Russia should look in 12 years' time. The occasion aroused special interest because Putin, after eight years concentrating power in his hands, is about to move aside and install a chosen successor after an election next month. Generals rubbed shoulders with oligarchs, muftis mingled with cabinet ministers, regional governors greeted editors and spy chiefs arrived alone to take their seats beneath six vast chandeliers. Roman Abramovich, Russia's wealthiest billionaire, was just one of the crowd, lost in a sea of faces near the back. Even opposition candidates in the presidential election showed up. In a chessboard of black suits and white shirts, broken by a general's cap or a mufti's turban, a mid-grey jacket and trousers was the height of informality. Although the Kremlin sent out invitations by telegram to "take part in the expanded session of the State Council of the Russian Federation", participants were left in no doubt that their opinions were not required. A small lectern stood on a red-carpeted dais in front of a giant white marble slab in the centre of the hall, which bears the names of more than 10,000 Russian members of the military awarded the Order of St. George for their heroism. Shortly before the appointed starting time, murmurs rippled across the audience as Dmitry Medvedev, the man Putin has anointed to succeed him, entered the hall with the man regarded as his closest rival for the job, Sergei Ivanov. Suddenly the crowd fell silent. To the blare of ceremonial music, an announcer uttered the president's name, the huge gilt double doors swung open and Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin walked briskly into the hall, up the red carpet and on to the dais. Putin gripped the side of the lectern and began reading animatedly from his speech. The audience listened intently, none more so than the figure in the centre of the front row. Medvedev sat bolt upright without any discernible expression on his face as his mentor outlined how Russia should be run for the whole of his future term -- and the two following terms. Oddly, Putin made no reference to Medvedev, or to a successor, or even to a "next government", speaking only of what needed to be done and what would be done. What did the president intend? Would he really hand over power when his term ends in May? There was no chance to ask -- no sooner was his 50-minute speech over than Putin was off the dais and back out through the double doors. The VIP audience poured out of the Grand Kremlin Palace into a courtyard to board their black, chauffeur-driven Mercedes and BMW limousines. A couple of bemused British tourists looked on. "It's all about power here, isn't it ?" said one to the other.
