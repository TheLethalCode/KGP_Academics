 ACCRA, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Stephane Mbia scored a double as Cameroon saw off Tunisia 3-2 after extra time on Monday to set up an African Nations Cup semi-final against hosts Ghana. The Indomitable Lions and Ghana, who beat Nigeria 2-1 on Sunday, will meet at Accra's Ohene Djan stadium in Thursday's first semi-final (1700 GMT). In the other semi-final at Kumasi's Baba Yara stadium (2030), Ivory Coast face 2006 champions Egypt, who beat Angola 2-1 in the earlier quarter-final on Monday. The game in Kumasi will bring together the teams that met in the 2006 final in Cairo, which Egypt won on penalties.

However, Cameroon had the last word when Mbia shot home from 12 metres after Joel Epalle headed on Geremi's thrown-in in the second minute of extra time. In Kumasi, a fortunate bounce off the body of striker Amr Zaki was enough to give Egypt a 2-1 win to retain hopes of a successful title defence. "We are looking forward to playing the Ivorians and all our players are fighting to keep the title," Egypt's assistant coach Shawky Gharib told reporters. Egypt opened the scoring in the 23rd minute when Angola captain Andre jumped up to block a free kick on the edge of the penalty area and the ball hit his hand, giving away a penalty. Hosni Abd Rabou converted for his fourth goal of the tournament. The lead lasted all of four minutes before Manucho thundered home a cracking left-footed shot from outside the are
