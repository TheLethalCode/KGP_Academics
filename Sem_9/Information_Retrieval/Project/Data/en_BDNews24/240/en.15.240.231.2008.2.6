<TITLE> Britain's Brown backs use of wiretap evidence in court </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Gordon Brown gave the green light on Wednesday for some wiretap evidence to be used in British court cases, but only if strict conditions designed to protect national security could be met. The move would end an unusual culture of secrecy surrounding telephone taps in Britain, one of the only countries in the world where secret tapings are not used to secure convictions. Both main opposition parties, as well as rights groups, have long urged the government to lift the restrictions to make it easier to prosecute terrorism suspects and reduce the need for harsh measures like lengthy detention without charge. The security services are against wire tap evidence, fearing exposure to public scrutiny will undermine their tactics. Brown told parliament he accepted the conclusions of a cross-party committee that "it should be possible to find a way to use some intercept material as evidence". He also agreed with the committee, led by former civil servant John Chilcot, that safeguards to ensure security and cooperation between intelligence agencies must be respected. "We will do nothing to put the security of our country at risk and we'll do nothing to put in jeopardy the work of our security agencies," Brown said. The conditions, which include giving the intercepting agencies the right to veto the use of their material in prosecutions, mean it could be a while before intercept evidence is used in court and, even then, it would be on a limited basis. "We will proceed to develop a detailed implementation plan under which material might be made available to be used in criminal cases in England and Wales -- subject, and strictly subject, to meeting all the Chilcot conditions," Brown added. Opposition Conservative Party leader David Cameron said new laws should come quickly: "We must not put off endlessly what needs to be done," he said. British police say wiretaps have helped them stop terrorist plots, but they use other evidence to win convictions in court. Rights groups say allowing wiretap evidence could reduce the need for harsh anti-terrorism measures like long pre-trial detention and "control orders" imposing movement restrictions on people the government says are dangerous but cannot be charged. But Brown said the review had found no evidence to suggest allowing intercept evidence would reduce the need for control orders, nor would his government stop a push to extend the time terrorism suspects can be held without charge beyond 28 days. The issue of bugging has also come into the fore in recent days after it emerged that police bugged a member of parliament from Brown's Labour Party during a meeting in prison with a terrorism suspect from his constituency.
