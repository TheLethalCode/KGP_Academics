 Biplob Rahman bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com) The Election Commission has decided to use transparent ballot boxes to be made at home for the next elections, CEC ATM Shamsul Huda said Wednesday. "We've decided to go for making transparent ballot boxes here in a joint investment venture at a minimal cost," the chief election commissioner told bdnews24.com. "There won't be any further need of importing ballot boxes incurring huge foreign currency expenditure." "An international tender will be floated soon in this respect," Huda said. Transparent boxes are more fragile than steel ones, the CEC said, adding that once the joint venture works out Bangladesh will not have to import ballot boxes prior to elections in future. EC officials said local concerns such as Machine Tools Factory, Bengal Plastics Industries and others have expressed interest in manufacturing clear plastic ballot boxesin addition to foreign interests from Canada and Denmark. Machine Tools Factory offered to procure or lease equipment from abroad and make the boxes locally. The Canadian embassy notified the Election Commission in 2006 that Canada would need about two years to manufacture enough transparent ballot boxes to cover 9.5 crore voters, at a cost of around Tk 35 crore. Three years ago, the EC during the previous BNP-led coalition government had rejected a European Union offer of free transparent ballot boxes. Transparent boxes rule out vote rigging by means such as stuffing boxes with fake ballots. They are also lightweight and easily portable. EC officials have said the 11,000 steel ballot boxes made by Machine Tools Factory prior to the 2007 elections will be used in the upcoming city corporation elections in April. Beginning on Sep 12, the EC has so far held dialogue with 16 political parties to discuss electoral reforms, during which the Awami League and its allies demanded the use of transparent ballot boxes in the upcoming elections. bdnews24.c
