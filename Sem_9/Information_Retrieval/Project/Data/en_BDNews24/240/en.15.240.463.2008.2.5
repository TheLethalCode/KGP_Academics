 Dhaka, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com)  The interim cabinet Tuesday focused on preventive measures and public awareness to arrest the spread of the avian influenza virus, a spokesman said. The deadly H5N1 strain has already spread to 113 farms in 37 districts, as the ongoing drive against the virus resulted in the culling of about half a million birds, said the chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim at a news briefing. Manik Lal Samaddar, special assistant to the chief adviser, presented a report at a cabinet meeting at the Chief Adviser's Office on the current situation of the menace, Munaim said. Samaddar, assigned to oversee the ministry of fisheries and livestock, explained to the cabinet the preventive measures to check the virus, as experts say any massive outbreak of it could be deadly as the country is overcrowded and people lack awareness. bdnews24.c
