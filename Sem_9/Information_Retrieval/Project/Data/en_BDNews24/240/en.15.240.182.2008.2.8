 LONDON, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - International mediators cannot afford to fail in Kenya, former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, who has been leading efforts to end violence in the East African country, said on Friday. "I'm not ready to contemplate failure. I'm not ready to give up now, and the team working with me are of the same spirit," Annan told Britain's BBC radio. "We cannot afford to fail."
