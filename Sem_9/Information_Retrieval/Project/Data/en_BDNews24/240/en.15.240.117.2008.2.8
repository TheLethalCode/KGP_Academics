 Dhaka, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com)  Acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman Friday said his party would start talks Sunday to forge a 'grand alliance with all pro-liberation forces' apart from tying up with like-minded parties ahead of the national polls. "We want to expand the boundary of our association. We have talked with our 14-party alliance partners (on the issue)," Zillur said. "We will hold talks with them from next Sunday. We will try to form a grand alliance with all pro-liberation forces," said the acting president. He talked to reporters after a meeting with the Bangladesh Krishak League and party representatives from Faridpur district at his Gulshan home. Zillur said he told the Krishak League and Faridpur district activists to quietly prepare for the elections. "There is no alternative to the transfer of power except through elections," he said. The acting chief said he was hopeful that the Appellate Division would uphold the constitution and the High Court's verdict that scrapped Azam Jahangir Chowdhury's extortion case against Sheikh Hasina after ruling it illegal. Referring to the Election Commission, Zillur said: "Forget the idea of announcing the election schedule in September. Hold the national elections by March or April." Zillur added that he felt there might be a 'crisis' if the general elections were not held sometime in March or April. Earlier, the Krishak League and Faridpur district chapter of the party contributed Tk 100,000 to Hasina's legal aid fund. bdnews24.
