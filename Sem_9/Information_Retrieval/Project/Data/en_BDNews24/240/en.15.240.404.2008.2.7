<TITLE> McCain reaches out to conservatives but only so far </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Washington, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Republican front-runner John McCain is trying to gain his party's presidential nomination by convincing conservatives he is one of them, without hurting support from moderate voters who have propelled his candidacy. The Arizona senator who scored major Super Tuesday victories is making clear that a key goal will be to energize the Republican base, but that he will never be able to placate all of his critics on the right. "I think my record indicates that I'm a solid conservative," McCain said, while noting that with some in his party, "we've got disagreements on specific issues from time to time." McCain is now the odds-on favorite to win the Republican nomination. His senior adviser, Charlie Black, said he believes it is "virtually impossible" for former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney or former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee to catch him in the remaining state contests. But he still faces some tough going against Romney, who has been riding a wave of conservative dissatisfaction with McCain. McCain has always been viewed with deep skepticism by the right wing of his party and, having become the front-runner, the conservative wing has unleashed its fury at him. Conservative talk show radio hosts who feel McCain is too moderate on illegal immigration and voted against tax cuts have been loudly rallying the troops against McCain, accusing him of being a liberal masquerading as a Republican. The persistent attacks have had some impact. While the Arizona senator has won some conservative support in the nominating contests so far, Romney and Huckabee have done better with the party's rank-and-file. McCain has an opportunity to reach out to conservatives on Thursday when he addresses the Conservative Political Action Committee, a group that was incensed a year ago when he refused to address the annual gathering. His goal, he told reporters: "We will unite the party behind our conservative principles and move forward and win the general election in November." He said he would "emphasize areas of conservative philosophy in which we are in agreement" -- such as facing down challenge of Islamic extremism and reducing what he calls out-of-control government spending. APPEALING TO MODERATES But, recognizing that his greatest appeal is attracting support from independent and moderate voters, he is in no way apologizing to conservatives for past votes and actions that have upset them, and he has made clear he will never satisfy all of them. McCain has an appealing resume as a former Vietnam prisoner of war, but to the chagrin of conservatives, he lacks detailed plans on how to turn around the faltering US economy. He told reporters on his plane on Wednesday he would gather his economic advisers soon to talk about what to do, calling it a "very, very important issue and I have to stay up with it." "McCain needs to consolidate the Republican conservative base," said pollster John Zogby. "While he offers the Republicans a unique opportunity to grab the center of the political spectrum in the general election -- moderates and independents -- his real problem is obtaining support among that core of conservatives who neither like him nor trust him." McCain wants to style himself in the mode of the late Ronald Reagan, who won the support of not only Republicans but conservative Democrats as well. He argues that he stands the best chance of defeating whomever the Democrats choose as their nominee to face off in the Nov. 4 election. He points to nominating victories in areas where Democrats traditionally do well, like New York and California, and polls that show him matching up well against Democrats Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama. "He will showcase conservatism that is not threatening, and will be attractive to independents and Reagan Democrats," said South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a key supporter. McCain, he said, will be "solid with conservatives but above anything else he'll always put his country in front.
