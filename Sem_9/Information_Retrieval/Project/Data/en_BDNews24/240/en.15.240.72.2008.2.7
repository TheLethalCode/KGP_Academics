 Dhaka, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com)Private TV station NTV's managing director Enayetur Rahman Bappi Thursday was freed on bail from Dhaka Central Jail. "The documents on his bail reached the jail authorities from the High Court Wednesday afternoon. After completion of all formalities he was released at 11am Thursday," deputy inspector general (DIG), prisons, major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui said. RAB arrested Bappi on March 6 last year on charges of illegally possessing a car imported under tax-free quota set for lawmakers. They seized the Hummer car from a building at Karwan Bazar in the city on March 5. Bappi told RAB that he had taken the car from former MP Harun-or Rashid. RAB asked Rashid and him to go to RAB-2's Satmasjid camp with the documents of the car on March 6. Rashid was arrested when he had gone to the RAB-2 office at Maghbazar with the documents. Bappi was also detained when he had turned up at the RAB office the same day. Rashid imported the car in tax-free quota in 2005 and handed it over to Bappi although the law prohibits vehicles brought under tax-free quota changing hands before three years of purchase. Rashid is still in jail. bdnews24.
