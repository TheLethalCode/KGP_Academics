<TEXT>
 Los Angeles, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - No one will get inside one of Hollywood's most exclusive Oscar night parties this year: Vanity Fair magazine said on Tuesday it was scrapping its famous fete in support of Hollywood's writers in their three-month-old strike. "After much consideration, and in support of the writers and everyone else affected by this strike, we have decided that this is not the appropriate year to hold our annual Oscar party," the magazine said in a statement on its Web site. The announcement came just as the Writers Guild of America and the movie and television studios sent strong signals that they were on the verge of an agreement that could end the strike this week. With the strike looming over the Feb. 24 Academy Awards, Sid Ganis, president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, said on Monday that the Oscars would take place with or without resolution of the labor conflict. The party, hosted by Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter, is one of the most coveted invitations in Hollywood on Oscar night, drawing A-list stars and top Oscar winners. And the magazine said it would resume its annual bash next year. "We want to congratulate all of this year's nominees and we look forward to hosting our 15th Oscar party next year," the magazine said.
