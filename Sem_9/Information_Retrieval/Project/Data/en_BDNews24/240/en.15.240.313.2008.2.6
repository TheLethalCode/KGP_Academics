<TEXT>
 Benapole, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com) Benapole land port was forced to close Wednesday, as all customs activities ground to a halt due to the Indian state-wide strike in West Bengal, a port official said. "All export and import activities have been stopped since morning," said Didarul Alam, cargo supervisor at the Benapole border crossing. Cargo trucks headed through West Bengal were prevented from reaching the Indian land port of Petrapole, while trucks waiting for customs clearance were unable to enter Bnapole from India, Didarul said. "Several hundreds of trucks have been stranded in the port with the halting of all export-import." A strike over the killing of protesters by police in eastern India shut schools, offices, and businesses in West Bengal Wednesday, bringing another political headache for a troubled communist-led state government. Protesters stopped trains and buses in the state capital, Kolkata, as the strike took hold, witnesses and police said. The strike was called by the Forward Bloc, an ally of the state government, after police opened fire on their supporters in a northern district on Tuesday, killing at least six people. bdnews24.c
