 LONDON, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's leading share index extended losses and was down 1.8 percent at midsession on Thursday after an expected Bank of England interest rate cut and after GlaxoSmithKline gave a weak outlook. GlaxoSmithKline slumped 7.9 percent after the drugmaker missed forecasts with a 1 percent fall in 2007 earnings and said they would fall further in 2008 due to declining sales of diabetes drug Avandia and increased generic competition. Elsewhere in the sector, AstraZeneca dropped 3 percent after Indian drugmaker Ranbaxy Laboratories said it had received tentative US approval to sell a generic form of Astra's blockbuster heartburn and ulcer pill Nexium. At 1221 GMT, the FTSE 100 was down 105.8 points at 5,769.6. "It's really a choice between two evils and I would avoid a recession whenever possible," said Edward Menashy, an economist at Charles Stanley, of the Bank of England cut. "So therefore I would say quite honestly that they've done the right thing, they've got lower interest rates and more to follow through. "I think they will cut rates further without any doubt whatsoever ... 4.5 percent by the end of 2008 would not surprise me." The Bank of England cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points to 5.25 percent to help shore up the economy in the face of weakening demand and continued financial market turmoil. However, it warned inflation risks remained a concern and some slowing in economic growth was required in any case to get inflation back to target in the medium term. European shares were also weaker by midsession. The European Central Bank was expected to leave euro zone rates at 4 percent at 1245 GMT. Banks were standout losers apart from drugmakers. Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, HBOS and Lloyds TSB lost between 1.2 and 3.4 percent. Alliance & Leicester fell 7 percent after Spanish bank Santander said it has no acquisition plans at the moment in general and is not considering bidding for the British lender in particular. Directories business Yell Group topped losers, down nearly 15 percent after it said a weakening UK economy had forced it to cut revenue guidance for its domestic business and crimped its ability to exploit more flexible pricing regulations. Rolls-Royce shed 8.9 percent on disappointment the British engine maker only raised its dividend by a third, below expectations. Among other companies announcing results, BT Group lost 8 percent after the company, the biggest UK fixed-line telecoms provider, missed third-quarter revenue targets as competition in broadband and a drop in quiz show phone-ins took its toll. Cable & Wireless was down 1.7 percent. Gas producer BG Group, however, climbed 4.5 percent to top the gainers' list after it reported a 25 percent rise in fourth-quarter net profit. Miners were also generally weaker despite the current merger and acquisition activity within the sector. BHP Billiton lost 2.8 percent after its sweetened $147.4 billion bid for rival Rio Tinto was rejected late on Wednesday. Rio was down 2.6 perce
