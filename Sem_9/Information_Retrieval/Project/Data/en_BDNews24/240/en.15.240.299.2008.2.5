<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com)  The interim cabinet Tuesday approved a newly drafted production sharing contract meant to guide a new phase of exploration for oil and gas in the Bay of Bengal. In a meeting at the Chief Adviser's Office, the council of advisers gave the thumbs-up to the updated version of the contract titled, "Model Production Sharing Contract". The approval means some vital changes are imminent to the previous practices in awarding contracts for exploring and managing oil and gas fields. Energy secretary Mohammad Mohsin said by phone that they would immediately invite proposals for what would be the third round bidding for exploration in Bangladesh's waters. Under the new PSC, a company that would win the bid for any deep sea field would initially strike a deal for five years while for field in the shallow part the initial term would be of four years. The new document also abolishes a previous practice under which official oil and gas agency Petrobangla used to pay corporate taxes to the government on behalf of the exploration firm. From now the company intending to explore and manage a field will pay the taxes. The updated contract ensures that an international oil company (IOC) is no more able to sell more than 50 percent stakes in any field to any second company without prior approval from the government. Earlier, an IOC could sell their stakes at a high rate without prior permission from the government. Petrobangla used to get no benefits from such any new deal. Previously, IOCs just needed to notify the government about the sale to the stakes. The updated regulations stipulate that no expenditure can be made on any work without approval of a joint review committee. The budget for the work has to be pre-approved by the committee. If the approval is not taken the expenditure would not be covered in cost recovery. According to the model PSC, firms have to inform Petrobangla of any emergency work in 72 hours and a detailed report has to be submitted in 30 days. The PSC included a separate article for use of local manpower. The model PSC proposed building up a fund for removal of abandoned installations. The fund is to be floated by collecting money from the income of the firm involved. However, if any company removes the abandoned installations at its own initiative the money would be refunded. The procedures for the third round bidding were initiated in 2005 but the effort did not get through. Bangladesh's waters have been divided into 28 blocks, of which eight gas blocks are in the shallow sea while 22 are in the deep sea. The area of each block ranges from 2000 square kilometres to 7,000 square kilometres. Tenders will be floated this time for exploration in 28 blocks. With these 28 blocks the total blocks in the country stands at 54. The first round of international bidding for oil and gas exploration in 23 blocks in land and sea areas was invited in 1993-94. The second round of tender was invited in 1997-98. bdnews24.
