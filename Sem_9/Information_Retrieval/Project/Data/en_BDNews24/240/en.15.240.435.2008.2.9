 Islamabad, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suspected suicide bomber killed 14 people and wounded 24 at an election rally in northwest Pakistan on Saturday, an Interior Ministry spokesman said. "We've been told 14 people were killed and 24 wounded. Apparently it was a suicide attack," said the spokesman, Javed Iqbal Cheema. The leader of the Awami National Party, Afrasiab Khattak, who was addressing the rally in the town of Charsadda in North West Frontier Province, told Dawn Television he was safe. "There was an explosion at my meeting, there was a big bang and I saw some people getting hit. I'm fine," he said. The ANP is a secular party and is competing with religious parties in the legislative elections on Feb. 18. The elections were postponed from Jan. 8 after opposition leader Benazir Bhutto was killed in a suicide attack on Dec. 27
