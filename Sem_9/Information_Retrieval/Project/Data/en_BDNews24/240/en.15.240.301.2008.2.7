 NEW DELHI, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thomas Bjorn shot a fluent 68 to move into a share of the early lead in the first round of the inaugural Indian Masters on Thursday, the Dane's solid play contrasting sharply with that of favourite Ernie Els. The South African world number four struggled around the tight Delhi Golf Club course and carded a three-over 75, including a quadruple-bogey on the par-five 18th (his ninth), to sit well off the pace set by the morning frontrunners.
