<TITLE> Ukraine leader wants EU free trade deal in a year </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KIEV, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Viktor Yushchenko said on Wednesday, a day after his ex-Soviet state was accepted into the World Trade Organisation, that he wanted free trade talks with the European Union to be concluded within a year. The EU set Ukraine's WTO membership as a condition for a free trade agreement, which would further integrate Ukraine into the rich 27-member bloc. Kiev has said it would like to join the EU, although there is no target date. "We have exchanged documents with the European Commission about what is needed to harmonise the free trade regimes," Yushchenko said in an address to students. "I think we need 10-12 months for this. It is possible that to reach compromises on this or that position would take more time. This is labour-intensive work." Deputy Prime Minister Hryhory Nemyrya said in mid-January that talks with the EU to abolish trade barriers would be a "Herculean task" that could take five years to complete. The EU is Ukraine's largest trading partner, buying a quarter of its exports. The country of 47 million is a leading global exporter of steel, grains and chemicals.
