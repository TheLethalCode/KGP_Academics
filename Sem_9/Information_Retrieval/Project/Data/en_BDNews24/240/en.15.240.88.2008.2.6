 Rangpur, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com)Demonstrating students of Carmichael University College in Rangpur clashed with police Wednesday, as their demands to turn the college into a full-fledged university turned violent. Over a thousand students were involved in a showdown with riot police near Lalbagh Road in Rangpur. Initially, a smaller number of students had formed a human chain and partially blocked a nearby road around 10 am. Police arrested a handful of the students, but witnesses and a bdnews24.com correspondent reported from the scene that around ten were injured as police made the arrests. Later over a thousand students took to the streets in protest. Police intercepted the angry crowd as it was approaching Rangpur's Lalbagh Road. The law enforcers threw teargas and charged with batons to disperse the demonstrators, who in the course of their protests vandalised the college's administrative building, power substation and the post office on campus. A meeting of the council of advisers on Feb 2 proposed the establishment of a university in Rangpur. The chief adviser approved a note Tuesday related to the proposal. bdnews24.c
