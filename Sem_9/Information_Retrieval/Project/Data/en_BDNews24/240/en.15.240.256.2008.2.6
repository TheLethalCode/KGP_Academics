 NEW YORK, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil fell to a nearly two-week low on Tuesday after a report showed the vast US services sector contracted to recessionary levels in January, reinforcing fears energy demand will slow. The Institute for Supply Management said its services index plunged to 41.9 in January from 54.4 in December, the lowest since the mild U.S. recession in 2001 after the Sept. 11 attacks destroyed the World Trade Center in New York. "The (crude) market is obviously affected by worries about recession," said Andy Lebow, energy analyst at MF Global in New York.

Worries about the outlook for global energy demand growth in the fallout of a U.S. housing crisis and credit crunch have pulled oil back from a record high above $100 a barrel hit in early January. Oil briefly struck the triple-digit region amid declining inventory levels and robust demand growth from developing economies like China and India -- leading major oil consumer nations to demand more crude from OPEC. But the recent slump has changed the equation for the cartel, leading some member nations -- Iran and Venezuela -- to argue for reduced output when they next meet in March. OPEC decided last week to maintain current output limits despite calls from consumer nations for more oil to bring energy prices down and take pressure off the economy. Tuesday's losses in oil prices were tempered by disruptions to oil imports in Texas due to dense sea fog and rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East after attacks by Turkey on northern Iraq. Data from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), due on Wednesday, is expected to show a 2.2 million-barrel build in crude stocks, a 2.1 million-barrel decline in distillates and a 1.9 million-barrel increase in gasoline inventories, a Reuters preliminary poll of analysts show
