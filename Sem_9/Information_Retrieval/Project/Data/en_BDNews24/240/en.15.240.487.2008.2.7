 Washington, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States said on Wednesday it lifted restrictions on aid to Thailand after the new Thai Cabinet was sworn in, marking the return of elected government after a September 2006 coup. President George W Bush suspended about $35 million in assistance to Thailand, including funds designed to promote military professionalism, after former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra was deposed by a military coup. "We congratulate Thailand's new cabinet on its inauguration, and the Thai people on their success in re-establishing an elected government," State Department spokesman Tom Casey said in a statement. Political veteran Samak Sundaravej, 72, was elected prime minister in December after Thailand's first parliamentary elections since the coup. Samak's Cabinet was sworn in by King Bhumibol Adulyadej on Wednesday. "Deputy Secretary (John) Negroponte has determined and certified to Congress that a democratically elected government has taken office in Thailand, removing legal restrictions on assistance to the government of Thailand," Casey said. "We look forward to engaging across a range of issues with Prime Minister Samak's government," Casey added
