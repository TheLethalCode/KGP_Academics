 Jakarta, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A landslide triggered by heavy rain has killed seven people in Indonesia's Central Java province, a health official said on Wednesday. A torrent of mud slammed into houses in Sindangwangi village on the northern coast of Java island on Tuesday evening, burying seven people, said Rustam Pakaya, head of the health ministry's crisis centre. Rescuers managed to unearth their bodies early on Wednesday, he said. One person was injured. Indonesia suffers heavy flooding and landslides every rainy season. Five people have died and 100,000 been displaced in the capital Jakarta since Friday because of rain and floods, Pakaya said. The flooding in Jakarta also brought the city to a standstill and forced the closure of the main airport for several hours.
