 Dhaka, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com)  Law adviser AF Hassan Ariff Thursday brushed off reports of plans to form a national government and said the constitution did not allow such arrangement. "No," the adviser said in reply to the question on whether a national government could be formed in line with the constitution. "I don't know if there has been any such initiative. Rumour is endless. This rumour has no base. So there is no need to give an explanation on it." Ariff said the emergency rules might be amended and it would depend on the fate of the government's appeal against the High Court verdict that scrapped the extortion case against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina. The High Court Wednesday also ruled illegal the extortion case filed by businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury against the former prime minister. Ariff had no comment on the judgement. Asked if bringing such cases under emergency rules was unlawful, he said: "Only court has the right to say it, not the ministry." The adviser stressed a congenial atmosphere to start the process of holding polls. "The obstacles have to be removed amid the state of emergency. The chief election commissioner briefed the chief adviser on the matters." Ariff, also in charge of the religious affairs ministry, discussed the reported irregularities in hajj management and shared his experience with reporters. He said the taskforce's help would be sought to stop corruption and irregularities in hajj management, if necessary. "Thousands of people go to Saudi Arabia to perform hajj every year. People at the hajj mission misbehave with the pilgrims. They face miseries there. They don't get the cooperation they want from the mission." The matter was being examined, Ariff said. "I went to perform hajj in 1998. I saw the problems first-hand," he said. bdnews24.c
