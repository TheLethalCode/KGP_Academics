 PARIS (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jerome Kerviel, the trader blamed by French bank Societe Generale for huge losses, was jailed while police questioned a broker on whether he knew about Kerviel's illicit deals. Kerviel was taken to La Sante prison, close to the centre of Paris, where high-profile suspects such as business leaders and politicians are often held while under investigation. His lawyer, Elisabeth Meyer, was seen by reporters at the scene leaving the hearing in tears. She said she would appeal the decision of the Paris appeals court. The court ruled that Kerviel, a junior staffer blamed by SocGen for a $7 billion trading loss, should be held in custody during the investigation because he might try to run or act in concert with any accomplices he may have had. Meanwhile, police questioned a second person, identified by two sources familiar with the matter as Moussa Bakir. Bakir works at Newedge, a brokerage formerly known as Fimat that carried out orders on behalf of Kerviel. Newedge's offices were raided by police on Thursday. Bakir's initial 24-hour detention period had been extended by another day, a legal source said. If the investigation finds that others had a hand in Kerviel's illicit trades, prosecutors may have new grounds to press fraud charges. SocGen has maintained that Kerviel acted on his own and SocGen lawyer Jean Veil said it was "premature" to comment on the developments in the probe. Kerviel, for his part, has told police that it was impossible that his supervisors could have been entirely in the dark about his activities. The latest twist comes at a time when Societe General is working on a rights issue to raise 5.5 billion euros to repair its balance sheet after the trading losses and write-downs linked to the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis. SocGen's board plans to meet this weekend to finalize details of the issue, which is expected to be launched next week, a source close to the matter said. Jean-David Scemama, a lawyer for the Newedge broker, was quoted by French news agency Agence France Presse as saying Kerviel was one of a number of people his client had business dealings with but that he was "relaxed" about the fact he was being questioned. Scemama did not return calls seeking comment. Kerviel has been placed under formal investigation for breach of trust, computer abuse and falsification, but had been freed under judicial supervision on January 28 after investigating magistrates dropped fraud accusations from the charge sheet. Kerviel told AFP in an interview on Tuesday that he accepted his share of responsibility for the losses but did not want to be made a scapegoat. He said he conducted the trades to make money for the bank but was not seeking to enrich himself.
