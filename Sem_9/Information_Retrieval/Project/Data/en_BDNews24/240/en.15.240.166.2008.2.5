 OSLO, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Norway said on Tuesday it would boost its civilian aid to Afghanistan by 50 percent this year and called on the United Nations to play a stronger coordinating role in the international reconstruction effort there. NATO-member Norway has about 500 soldiers serving in Afghanistan and contributed about 500 million crowns ($90.50 million) in development aid in 2007. Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere announced in parliament Norway would raise civilian aid to Afghanistan to 750 million crowns in 2008. He said Norway remained committed to supporting the NATO-led mission and the Western alliance should stay in charge of the military operation, but urged a bigger and better coordinated effort on the civilian side. "The international community's effort has long been too fragmented," Stoere said. "The UN must strengthen its efforts as a coordinating body." The reconstruction of Afghanistan, where Taliban rulers were toppled by a US-led invasion in 2001, has suffered underfunding, turf battles between rival agencies, corruption among officials and a resurgence of Taliban-led violence. Norway, which has resisted calls from the United States and other allies to send more soldiers to southern Afghanistan, has long said a higher priority must be put on reconstruction and institution-building in Afghanistan. Local media has said senior Norwegian diplomat Kai Eide is a candidate to become the next UN special envoy for Afghanistan. Participating in the NATO mission in Afghanistan has caused tensions within Norway's three-party coalition government. The Socialist Left (SV) Party has grave reservations about it and has sought to limit the Norwegian role. But an opinion poll published on Tuesday showed 57 percent of Norwegians support Norway's participation and 32 percent oppose, national broadcaster NRK reported.
