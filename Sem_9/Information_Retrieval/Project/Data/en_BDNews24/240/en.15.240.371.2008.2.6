<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com)  Khandaker Delwar Hossain, the Khaleda Zia-nominated BNP secretary general, Wednesday said any elections keeping her and Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina in jail would not be acceptable. "Both the leaders have been locked up to keep them away from elections. No polls will be accepted with them behind bars," Delwar said at a meeting with lawyers belonging to Dhaka District Lawyers Association. The BNP leader demanded immediate release of the two former prime ministers and all political leaders if the polls were to be peaceful. Delwar also asked the caretaker government to lift the state of emergency to create an election-friendly atmosphere. The view exchange meeting was held at the association's office in old part of the capital. bdnew
