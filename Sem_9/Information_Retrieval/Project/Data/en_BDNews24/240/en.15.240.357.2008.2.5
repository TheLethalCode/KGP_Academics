 Dhaka, Feb 5 (bdnews24.com) - The government starts a drive in a day or two to shut down illegally-operating CNG conversion workshops. Stern action is also being taken against the users of low-quality CNG cylinders. The decision was taken at a ministerial meeting at the power, energy and mineral resources ministry Tuesday, chaired by the chief adviser's special assistant Prof M Tamim. After the meeting, Tamim told reporters that a drive against the illegally set-up workshops would start in a couple of days. He said the cylinders of vehicles would be checked during refilling. "Gas would not be given to the users of low-grade cylinders," he said. Tamim said a decision had also been taken to review the procedure to set up CNG filling stations. "The process was being further scrutinised." Officials present at the meeting said approval of the Energy Regulatory Commission for establishing CNG stations had also come up for discussion. Stickers will be provided for approved cylinders and distributed through Rupantarito Prakritik Gas Company, filling stations and CNG vehicle owners associations. The energy ministry said that there were 210 CNG filling stations throughout the country including 96 in the capital. Another 58 stations will go into operation in the next six months. The number of CNG-run vehicles in the country is 1.27 lakh. bdnews
