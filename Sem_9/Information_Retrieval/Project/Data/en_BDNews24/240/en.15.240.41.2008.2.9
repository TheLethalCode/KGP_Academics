<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com)  The disputed secretary general of a BNP faction, Khandaker Delwar Hossain, Saturday ruled out the possibility of reconciliation with the reformist splinter of the troubled party. "It will not be possible on my part to reconcile with the reformist BNP faction in view of a decision made on Oct 29 by the standing committee," Delwar told reporters at his home. Acting BNP chief M Saifur Rahman said Thursday that he was ready to resign from his post in the interests of party unity. Delwar demanded the reformist faction overrule the decision taken on Oct 29 last year by the standing committee, which installed Saifur in the post of acting chief. "Withdraw the decision of the illegal meeting, and tell us what you will do. Do not confuse activists," Delwar said. The controversial Oct 29 reshuffle appointed Saifur acting chairperson in the absence of detained party chief Khaleda Zia and Hafizuddin Ahmed as secretary general. "The government is abusing the emergency powers rules by curbing basic human rights enshrined in the constitution. The emergency is being used as a tool of political torture," Delwar said. Delwar, appointed as secretary general by Khaleda, said the politicians had become victims. Delwar referred to the detention of Khaleda's adviser ASM Hannan Shah and Jubo Dal general secretary Syed Moazzem Hossain Alal. The former chief whip said: "The parliament's purpose is to formulate the law. The country cannot run by enacting ordinances outside parliament." Delwar pointed to the recent High Court ruling that declared it illegal to take any cases under the emergency powers rules. The BNP leader also reiterated his call for the release and medical treatment of BNP's senior joint secretary general Tarique Rahman, and brother Arafat Rahman Cocoboth in detention. "Tarique was tortured in remand. His medical report has proved that," Delwar alleged. The secretary general also demanded a probe into the death of Dhaka City Corporation commissioner Md Qayyum Khan, who died in Dhaka Central Jail Friday. bdnew
