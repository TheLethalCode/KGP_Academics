<TITLE> Hayden's return will solve catching woes, says Ponting </TITLE>

 SYDNEY, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The return of slips specialist Matthew Hayden should fix Australia's recent catching problems, captain Ricky Ponting said on Thursday. The Australians have been uncharacteristically sloppy in the field over the last few weeks, dropping a series of routine catches in the slips cordon. But Ponting believes the return from injury of Hayden, who normally fields at first slip, will solve the problem. "The sooner we can get Matty back into the side and give us a bit more structure back around our slips cordon the better," Ponting told reporters on Thursday. "The catching is a concern, no doubt about it. We put a few down in the test series (against India) and the other night was pretty poor as well, with two going down in the slips. "We've had guys moving all over the place in the cordon. Andrew Symonds coming in, Michael Clarke moving around first and second, me the other night being probably a specialist second-slipper finding myself at first slip and I put one down there." Ponting said Hayden, who has been troubled by a hamstring problem, had been cleared to play in Friday's one-dayer against Sri Lanka at the Sydney Cricket Ground, if the match goes ahead. The first two games in the triangular series were washed out in Brisbane and there is a danger Friday's match will also succumb to the foul weather after a week of torrential rain. The Australian players were forced to train indoors on Thursday with Ponting undergoing a longer than usual batting session to iron out any kinks in his injured back. The skipper missed last week's Twenty20 against India because of pain in his lower back but is confident of playing through the rest of the Australian summer. "My back has been better, I must admit, but it's just something that I have to get on top of," he said. "It has happened probably three times in the last couple of seasons. I have basically been immobile. "We've been pretty cautious with it over the past few days. I'll be right to get through the rest of this series
