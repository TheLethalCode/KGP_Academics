 BELGRADE, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Croatia's 3-0 friendly defeat by fellow Euro 2008 finalists Netherlands in Split came as a rude awakening for Slaven Bilic's men. Potential dark horses for the June 7-29 event in Austria and Switzerland, Croatia performed like also-rans against an inspired Dutch side.

"It was a painful defeat but there is no room for panic because it doesn't mean we have lost our quality overnight. "We will analyse what went wrong and come out stronger." Sublime passing and ball control by the Dutch, reminiscent of their 'total football' of the 1970s, tore Croatia apart in the first half as Ajax Amsterdam team mates John Heitinga and Klaas Jan Huntelaar gave the visitors a 2-0 lead. The home side improved after the interval but were undone by a clinical finish from Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink. "(Dutch coach) Marco van Basten has taught Bilic a lesson," said Zagreb daily Vecernje Novosti, adding: "Netherlands got the win they came for to show they have the mettle to win the European Championship
