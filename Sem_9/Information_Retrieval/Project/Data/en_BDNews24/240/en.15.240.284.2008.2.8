 Dhaka, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com)  A second-half strike from Mehdi Hasan Ujjal Friday took Abahani to the final of the Proteeti Pharma Victory Day Football Tournament at Bangabandhu National Stadium. The sky-blues beat arch-rival Mohammedan 1-0 in the second semifinal and take on Arambagh KS Sunday. Abahani, enjoyed better ball possession over a subdued Mohammedan in front of some 15,000-strong crowd at the big bowl. Mohammedan suffered a dented image from their previous match as they tried to avoid facing off Abahani by trying to lose the game. "Most of the Mohammedan players did not have the temperament needed in matches between two old foes," said Mohammedan coach Shafiqul Islam Manik. "Abahani deserved the triumph with their superb teamwork and won the match playing better football," admitted Manik. Ujjal, set by Jahid Parvez Chowdhuy from the right, send the ball over the head of Mohammedan's guest goalkeeper MN Shakil five minutes into the second half. "I feel happy to have scored the decisive goal after a long time," said striker-turned- medio Ujjal. "Abahani won the match with a great team spirit as there was enough understanding among the players," said Ujjal, who scored just once in the first-ever professional league in 2007. Ujjal along with Jahid kept Mohammedan defenders on their toes through some good plays down the wings. Playmakers Arif Khan Joy and Pranotosh fed them in the absence of Jahid Hasan Emili and Abul Hossain. Abahani's were unlucky not to have taken the lead in the first half when their guest striker Robin sent the ball wide in the 18th minute with only Shakil to beat. Ten minutes later, Mohammedan defender Biplob fended off a goal-bound Ujjal shot while Shahajuddin Tipu failed to connect a Robin cross from close. Ujjal finally broke the deadlock in the 50th minute, driving the ball home. Tipu and Ujjal missed the target in the 61st and 76th minute before Abahani went defensive. Mohammedan's Arafat Ronny took a powerful volley in the 67th minute, which went to the safe hands of Abahani goalkeeper Biplob. bd
