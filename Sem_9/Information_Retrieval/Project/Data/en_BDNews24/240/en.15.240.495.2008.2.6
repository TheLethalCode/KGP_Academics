 Dhaka, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com)  BNP leader Rizvi Ahmed said Wednesday that justice had been established with the High Court's verdict to cancel an extortion case against detained Awami League president Sheikh Hasina. "Justice has been established through the verdict. The High Court will judge if other cases under the emergency powers rules are correct," Ahmed said in reaction to the HC ruling. The High Court Wednesday scrapped the extortion case filed by businessman Azam J Chowdhury against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina after ruling its transfer under emergency powers rules illegal. BNP acting office secretary Rizvi also demanded the release of detained BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia and other political leaders from jail. bdne
