<TITLE> Berlusconi tries to unite Italy's right for vote </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ROME, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Silvio Berlusconi called on Italy's centre-right parties on Friday to run under a single banner in April's election, after the main centre-left party threw down the gauntlet and said it will compete alone, without its allies. Opinion polls suggest billionaire media tycoon Berlusconi will sweep back to power for the third time after the collapse last month of Romano Prodi's 20 month-old government. But the 71-year-old leader of Forza Italia and owner of AC Milan soccer club wants to avoid ruling with the kind of broad, bickering coalition that made Prodi's tenure such a misery. Ironically, Berlusconi now has to deal with an election law biased towards such coalitions that his last government left as a "poison pill" for Prodi just before losing the 2006 election. Nicknamed the "Cavaliere" (Knight), Berlusconi was the first prime minister in 50 years to serve a full term from 2001-2006. But he argued spectacularly with allies and last year dissolved their coalition, dismissing them all as "ectoplasm". As soon as Prodi's government fell, however, Berlusconi's main allies, the conservative National Alliance (AN) and the far-right Northern League, quickly rallied round him again. "There will no longer be the symbol of Forza Italia or AN, this is the People of Freedom and there will be a single group in parliament," Berlusconi said. The separatist League will keep its flag and run "in federation" with the new group, he said. "People of Freedom" was the name chosen by Berlusconi fans last November to replace the old House of Freedom alliance. A question mark hangs over the Union of Christian Democrats (UDC), once the third force party in Berlusconi's bloc, who have since withdrawn support and could even swap sides. Berlusconi, speaking to one of three TV channels owned by his Mediaset, said the single list was open to the UDC too, but its leader Pierferdinando Casini has ruled out such an option. DEADLY EMBRACE Berlusconi's adversary for the mid-April election is Rome's mayor Walter Veltroni, who is much younger at 52 and presents himself as a "new face" in politics compared to Berlusconi. Berlusconi's followers point out that Veltroni has actually been in politics far longer than Berlusconi, who burst onto the political scene in the early 1990s. Veltroni was a communist Rome councillor in the 1970s, member of parliament in the 1980s and a deputy prime minister in Prodi's 1996-98 government. He likens himself to U.S. Democratic hopeful Barack Obama, even using his "Yes we can!" slogan this week. Sensing the communist and Catholic allies who destabilised Prodi would be a liability, Veltroni wants the Democratic Party that he founded with Prodi last year to run alone in April. Berlusconi denied that his was a "countermove" to Veltroni's solo strategy which was "not down to courage but necessity, as they had to escape from the deadly embrace of the hard left". With just a couple of partners, Berlusconi would be less vulnerable to infighting than Prodi with his nine allies. But his age -- while dapper and dynamic for 71, Berlusconi has a pacemaker -- makes potential rivals out of allies like AN leader Gianfranco Fini, who occasionally reminds people he is 15 years younger. Hubert Zimmermann, associate politics professor at Cornell University in the United States, said that having an alliance made up of fewer parties was "an inherent advantage". "But the conflicts which have emerged within the coalition and the fact that his partners might consider Berlusconi increasingly a force of the past -- and themselves the obvious heirs -- won't make life easy for him," Zimmermann told Reuters. "The UDC might be easily tempted to switch sides if Veltroni does reasonably well in the elections -- as I expect," he sa
