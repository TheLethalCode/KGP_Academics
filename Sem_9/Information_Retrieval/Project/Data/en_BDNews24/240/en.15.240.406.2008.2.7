<TITLE> Nepal party slams Maoists on `parallel government' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Kathmandu, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nepal's biggest political party criticised the Maoists on Thursday for reviving a controversial "parallel government" council set up during their war against the monarchy, and said it violated a landmark peace deal. The former rebels have reactivated a "United Revolutionary People's Council", saying it would solve "problems faced by the people". The council, dissolved under the 2006 peace pact when the former rebels joined the political mainstream, acted as a parallel government in the war against the monarchy, collecting "taxes" in areas under their control. The setting up of the council will likely raise tensions with mainstream political parties ahead of constituent assembly elections due on Apr. 10, the centrepiece of the peace deal which will prepare a new constitution and formally declare an end to the monarchy. "This is a blatant violation of the comprehensive peace agreement," Ram Chandra Poudel, vice-president of the Nepali Congress party, the oldest and biggest political group, said. "This shows that the Maoists have not fully integrated themselves into the mainstream and want to keep their war time body alive," said Poudel, who is also the peace and reconstruction minister in the interim cabinet. "It will hurt the peace process and the constituent assembly elections." The Maoists say the panel will help implement development activities in the countryside and will not work as "parallel government". But they have not clarified its role. More than 13,000 people were killed in the Maoist conflict that hit the impoverished economy heavily dependent on aid and tourism. In a separate sign of rising tension with Maoists, the Nepali Congress said some of its workers including a former junior minister were injured after former rebels assaulted them during a tour of a village in west Nepal, a charge the Maoists deny
