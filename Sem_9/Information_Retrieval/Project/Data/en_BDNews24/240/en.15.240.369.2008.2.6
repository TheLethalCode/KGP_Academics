<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com)  The cabinet committee on public purchase Wednesday approved a tender for an inland container river terminal to be set up in Keraniganj, an adviser said. A total of Tk 154 crore has been allocated for the construction of the terminal, a project first of its kind to be implemented by the shipping ministry. The approval came from a meeting at the planning ministry, chaired by finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam. The terminal will be built on 90 acres of land in Pangaon area under Kunda union in Keraniganj. Former prime minister Khaleda Zia laid the foundation stone for the terminal in 1995, but the Awami League government cancelled it. After the Awami League tenure, the BNP-led alliance government revived the project but failed to complete it. bdnews
