 Jannatul Ferdous Dhaka University Correspondent Dhaka, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com)A new women-only residence hall at Dhaka University soon to be under construction will house 1,000 students, university authorities say. Dhaka University chief engineer Amir Hossain told bdnews24.com: "The residence will have twin halls to house 1,000 female students. The halls will eventually comprise two ten-storey buildings." Initially, however, one six-storey and one four-storey building will be constructed with an accumulated capacity for housing 512 students. The twin halls will be designed after Curzon Hall. Bangladesh Railway authorities handed over 2.59 acres of land allotted for the new halls to university authorities in 2006. Construction firm 'Masud & Company' were given the go-ahead on Jan 18 this year, to start building the residences. The cost of the construction will be Tk 16 crore. Tk 13 crore has been allotted so far. Amir Hossain said that it will cost an additional Tk 25 crore to complete the construction of all 20 storeys. A budget for the bungalow of the provost, bungalows for the residential teachers, and furniture for the residences has not yet been settled. University authorities had initially decided to name the hall after Khaleda Zia. Following various objections, the decision was reversed. When asked about the new name for the residence hall, DU vice chancellor Prof SMA Faiz said: "We will discuss the naming of the residence with the university senate later." "At the moment it is more important to concentrate on housing our female students." He also informed bdnews24.com that a proposal was recently sent to the education ministry regarding the construction of a new all-male student residence. bdnews24
