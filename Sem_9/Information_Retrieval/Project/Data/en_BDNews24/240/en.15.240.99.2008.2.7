 NAIROBI, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - It's a long, thick stroke. The white paint is still wet. Solomon Muhandi dips his brush again into a small cup, his hands dotted with irregular white spots. Finishing, Muhandi takes a step back: "Peace Wanted Alive" the sign reads, like hundreds of others the 31-year old has painted all over Kenya's largest slum.

The opposition says the government rigged the election -- a charge Kibaki's administration dismisses. Former U.N. chief Kofi Annan, who is mediating between the foes, has called for a truth and reconciliation committee to look into the killings. Surrounded by canvas paintings in his small studio, Muhandi says Kenya must first have peace before it tackles its deep social wounds and inequalities.
