 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com) -- With spring officially starting in four days warmer winds from the south have replaced the relatively mild wintry conditions that prevailed this year. Officials at the meteorological department said western low and cloudy conditions have raised the temperature, while humidity levels have also risen. The Met office said the temperature may dip if it rains, although not as much as was experienced previously. On Friday, the lowest temperature in the country was registered in Sreemongal, at 15.4 degrees Celsius, while in the capital the lowest temperature was recorded at 18.9 degrees Celsius. "Winter is about to take its leave. Besides, the temperature has increased due to the presence of clouds," director of Bangladesh Meteorological Department Samarendra Karmakar told bdnews24.com. "If the clouds disperse the temperature may slide slightly. However, there will be no more biting cold this year," Karmakar said. The director added that Bangladesh had experienced a fairly typical winter season this year, with temperatures occasionally being higher than normal. "The wind is currently blowing from the south, but as it is approaching in a roundabout way it is not raining. If the wind starts coming more directly some rain will fall," he said. The Met office also said this winter had been comparatively less cold, while the duration of the cold spells had also been shorter. The beginning of the winter season this year saw relatively mild conditions, and it was not until mid-January that the cold snap was felt. By the end of January temperatures were on the rise again. Executive director of Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies Dr Atiq Rahman told bdnews24.com: "This year's winter was comparatively warm, although a number of cold waves were experienced." "Overall it was warm, unless it rained. It is slightly abnormal, but not a major exception," said Atiq, an environment and climate change expert. According to the Met office, three cold waves hit the country this winter, being less than average, while their duration was also shorter than usual. On average five to six cold waves are experienced in a season. This winter's lowest temperature was 5.6 degrees Celsius, recorded in Sreemongal. The average lowest temperature was between 10 to 12 degrees Celsius. bdnews
