 Dhaka, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com)  Acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman Wednesday said the High Court verdict proved that party chief Sheikh Hasina was innocent. He also demanded that the former prime minister be released immediately from jail. In instant reaction to the verdict that cancelled the extortion case against the former prime minister, filed by businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury, Zillur said: "It has been unanimously recognised that our leader is innocent." "The verdict has made it clear that we are going to take part in the polls together with Sheikh Hasina." Speaking to the media at his Gulshan home, the AL leader said the verdict was constitutional. "It has been proved again that justice wins over injustice," he said. On the government's appeal against the verdict with the Appellate Division, Zillur said: "I firmly believe we would get justice in the Appellate Division as well." bdnews
