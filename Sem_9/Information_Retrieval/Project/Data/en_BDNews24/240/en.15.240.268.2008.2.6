<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Russian court on Wednesday refused to release on bail a jailed oil industry executive with HIV-AIDS who says he needs urgent medical treatment at a specialist hospital. Vasily Alexanian, a former executive at the Yukos oil firm, says he is going blind and needs urgent treatment that he cannot get inside the prison. He is awaiting trial for embezzlement, tax evasion and money laundering. The case has drawn international interest because Yukos was bankrupted by the Russian authorities and its founder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, jailed in what was widely seen as a Kremlin campaign to punish Khodorkovsky for his political ambitions. The European Court of Human Rights has made repeated requests to move Alexanian, who denies the charges, to a specialist hospital. But the Moscow court said the trial should be suspended while he gets treatment in the prison. "They are not giving me any treatment in there," Alexanian said from the cage where he is held during court hearings. "There is no guarantee they will give me access to a specialist clinic. All they are doing is adjourning the trial. That is all. Nothing else." Alexanian says he is being used as a pawn to put further pressure on Khodorkovsky, who could face another trial this year on new charges of money laundering and embezzlement. Lawyers say Alexanian's testimony could be key to new charges that have been brought against Khodorkovsky, and which would keep the former tycoon in jail for years to come. Khodorkovsky last week announced he was starting a hunger strike in solidarity with his former colleague. The presiding judge at the hearing said Alexanian would get the treatment he needed inside prison and that he might interfere with the trial if he was released on bail. "The court finds that the defence's request to grant bail to Alexanian should be rejected because if he is freed he could interfere with the progress of the trial," she said. "Alexanian has the opportunity in the conditions of pre-trial detention to receive all the treatment that he needs ... He will be given the treatment that doctors have recommended and that does not require that he be released from detention." Alexanian's family said he needed urgent treatment. "I think this is a very harsh decision," Alexanian's elder brother, Garnik, told Reuters. "I do not understand what it will take. Maybe they need him to collapse, to loose consciousness before they realise he should be released from there." Another of Alexanian's brothers works as a translator at Reuters' Moscow offi
