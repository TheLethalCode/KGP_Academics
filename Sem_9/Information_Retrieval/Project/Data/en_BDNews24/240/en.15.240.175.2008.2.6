<TEXT>
 Washington, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Democrats Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton split victories on "Super Tuesday" and Republican John McCain rolled to a string of big wins as 24 US states held contests to help select their parties' nominees for November's presidential election. Here are some quotes from the candidates: SEN. HILLARY CLINTON, NEW YORK DEMOCRAT "After seven years of a president who listens only to the special interests, you're ready for a president who brings your voice, your values and your dreams to your White House. And tonight, in record numbers, you voted not just to make history, but to remake America." REPUBLICAN MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR "Over the past few days a lot of people have been trying to say that this is a two-man race. Well, you know what? it is, and we're in it." SEN. JOHN MCCAIN, ARIZONA REPUBLICAN "Tonight, I think we must get used to the idea that we are the Republican Party front-runner for the nomination. And I don't really mind it one bit." SEN. BARACK OBAMA, ILLINOIS DEMOCRAT "There is one thing on this February night that we do not need the final results to know: Our time has come." REPUBLICAN MITT ROMNEY, FORMER MASSACHUSETTS GOVERNOR "I think there are some people who thought it was all going be done tonight, but it's not all done tonight. We're going to keep on battling. We're going to go all the way to the convention, we're going to win this thing, and we're going to get in to the White House."
