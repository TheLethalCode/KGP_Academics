 MOSCOW, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia said on Friday the Council of Europe would send observers to monitor a March presidential election that Europe's main vote watchdog has already declined to attend, accusing Moscow of unreasonable restrictions. President Vladimir Putin's protege, Dmitry Medvedev, is expected to easily win the election. But opponents complain Kremlin dominance over the airwaves and the use of government resources to help Medvedev make the campaign one-sided. Medvedev's campaign chief Sergei Sobyanin said Russia had received confirmation that the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) would monitor the vote. "I am happy that yesterday Duma chairman (Boris) Gryzlov received a letter from PACE saying that it would send a fully-fledged mission to Moscow to monitor the Russian presidential election," Sobyanin, Putin's chief of staff, told Andreas Gross, who leads PACE observers. "It's very important to note that Russian elections will be held in full accordance with the constitution and Russian law. We are happy to see anyone who wishes to help us in this process." The Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) said on Thursday it would not monitor the vote, citing what it termed unacceptable restrictions imposed by Moscow on the number of observers and the duration of their mission.
