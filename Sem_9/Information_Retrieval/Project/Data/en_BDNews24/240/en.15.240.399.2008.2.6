 LONDON, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's FTSE 100 was flat early on Wednesday after the previous session's steep losses on fears of a US recession, as investors sold banks and miners and switched into defensive plays like Vodafone. At 0854 GMT, the FTSE 100 was down 0.4 points at 5,867.6, after losing 2.6 percent on Tuesday. The UK benchmark index has lost 9 percent so far this year. European shares also fell in early trade. US stocks suffered their biggest drop in nearly a year on Tuesday after a dismal reading of services sector activity, while Japan's Nikkei average slid 4.7 percent on Wednesday. In the UK, banks, which have been hammered by global credit market turmoil in past several months, were standout losers. Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, Lloyds TSB, HBOS and Standard Chartered dropped between 0.4 and 1.8 percent. A survey showed consumer confidence in Britain fell to its lowest level in nearly four years in January as uncertainty over the economic outlook was compounded by market gyrations and inflation. "We are starting to get indications right now that there are signs of weakness beginning to creep into the economy, but nothing at this stage is terribly serious. The Bank of England will give a 25-basis point (cut) tomorrow," said Peter Dixon, UK economist at Commerzbank. "It will remain in a wait-and-see mode but it's going to cut by at least 75 basis points this year and obviously if the economy tanks, it will go by more. It has got more scope to do so than the Fed has now." The Bank of England is widely expected to cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 5.25 percent on Thursday. BHP Billiton shed 5.8 percent after the world's biggest mining group launched a hostile $174.4 billion bid for rival Rio Tinto in a move that could trigger a Chinese-led counterbid in the world's second biggest corporate takeover. Rio dipped 0.5 percent, while the rest of the mining sector also fell as base metal prices eased. But Xstrata gained 1.6 percent on market talk of a bid from Brazilian mining giant Vale, traders said. Xstrata declined to comment. Oil major Royal Dutch Shell lost 0.9 percent after going ex-dividend, while Cairn Energy dipped 0.9 percent and Tullow Oil eased 0.3 percent. But BP headed in the opposite direction, up 0.9 percent after Credit Suisse lifted its price target. Index heavyweight Vodafone added 0.6 percent, while Imperial Tobacco, which is also regarded as defensive, put on 0.9 percent. Pay-TV firm BSkyB rose 1.6 percent after it said it expected its profit performance for the full year to be in line with forecasts. Insurer Aviva slipped 1.7 percent after it posted an above-forecast increase in 2007 life and pensions sales, but said the higher-than-expected cost of summer floods in Britain meant it would miss a key general insurance target. AstraZeneca and Sage also fell after trading without the rights of divide
