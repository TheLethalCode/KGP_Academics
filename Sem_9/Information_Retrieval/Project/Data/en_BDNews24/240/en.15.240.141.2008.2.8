 KUMASI, Ghana, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Defending champions Egypt have reached their second successive African Nations Cup final by playing a stylish, passing game in a tournament where most other teams have favoured raw physical power. The Egyptians trounced hot favourites Ivory Coast 4-1 in Thursday's semi-final, a rematch of the 2006 final, which they won on penalties after a goalless draw. On that occasion, Egypt's fifth Nations Cup title was largely attributed to the advantage of playing on home soil in a tournament marred by controversial refereeing. This time, their slick football has been one of the highlights of the tournament and there is little argument that they deserve their place in Sunday's final against Cameroon. Eleven of the 16 coaches who began the Nations Cup are European and their influence has been clear with most teams playing a fast and furious game. The Ghana-Cameroon semi-final played earlier on Thursday in Accra was fairly typical as the midfield was often bypassed and the tackles flew in. In contrast, Egypt bore more resemblance to a South American side, stroking the ball around in midfield and patiently trying to work an opening. At one stage they strung more than 40 passes together. MIND GAMES Midfielders Hosni Abd Rabou and Ahmed Hassan were always looking to open up the Ivorian defence with cleverly weighted passes rather than simply hoofing upfield for the forwards to chase. "All the Egyptian players like South American football, we like Argentina, we like Brazil, we like this style of football," assistant coach Shawky Gharib told Reuters. "But the most important thing is that we play with our minds. First of all, we think about what we are going to do on the pitch," said Gharib, who routinely acts as spokesman for senior coach Hassan Shehata. Clinical efficiency in attack is another Egyptian attribute and the team have averaged just under three goals a game for the tournament. Egypt remain something of an enigma with nearly all their players still plying their trade at home. Only one of the players who started on Thursday is based abroad, yet they still managed to upstage an Ivorian team replete with well known players from the English and French leagues. On Sunday, they will find themselves in a similar situation when they take on a powerful Cameroon side headed by Barcelona's Samuel Eto'o. Egypt have already outfoxed Cameroon in the group stage, winning 4-2 and are confident of repeating their feat. "Now, we will win the final," said Ghari
