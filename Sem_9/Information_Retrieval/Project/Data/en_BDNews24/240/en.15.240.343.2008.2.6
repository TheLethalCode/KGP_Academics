 LONDON, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares traded lower early on Wednesday, tracking falls in the United States and Asia on growing recession fears, and hit by losses in BHP Billiton and banks. At 0958 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.5 percent at 1,307.93 points, led lower by banks. The index slipped 3.1 percent on Tuesday after shockingly poor US services data. Credit Suisse fell 4 percent, while BNP Paribas, UBS, Royal Bank of Scotland all slipped by 1.6 to 2.2 percent. But Societe Generale, the bank at the centre of a trader scandal, rose 2.3 percent as traders speculated about a bid ahead of its planned capital increase. Deutsche Postbank jumped 9.6 percent after a newspaper report said parent Deutsche Post was looking for a partner to Postbank to forge a leading German retail bank group. Deutsche Post said it had not made any decision about the future of Postbank. Miners were mainly negative though investors were torn between concern that BHP Billiton's monster $147 billion bid for rival Rio would succeed and hope that persistent talk of a bid for Xstrata from Brazil's Vale would lead to a deal. BHP lost 5.6 percent, Xstrata gained 2 percent and other miners such as Antofagasta and Vedanta were lower. Analysts said that in the current mood of uncertainty, markets were constantly on edge. "At the moment we have an asymmetric market, a market that is chasing bad news," said Alain Bokobza, head of strategy at Societe Generale in Paris. "The probability of the United States entering recession in Q1 is going through the 50 percent barrier, and the rise in the dollar shows that people are starting to play a fall in ECB rates quicker than market expectations," he added. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.6 percent, Germany's DAX slipped 0.4 percent and France's CAC lost 0.5 percent. SCURRY TO SAFE HAVEN While prices of the traditional safe-haven asset classes of gold and U.S. Treasuries edged up in tandem with a fall in global equities, investors also sought succour within the stock market, buying telcoms, utilities and food stocks. France Telecom gained 1.9 percent after it raised its cash flow outlook for 2008, and tobacco and food shares rose, with Imperial Tobacco gaining 0.9 percent, and foods group Danone advancing 1.6 percent. The FTSEurofirst 300 has fallen 13 percent so far this year, after a meagre 1.6 percent gain in the whole of last year as a bull market turned gradually bearish in the face of a global credit squeeze, poor economic data and earnings downgrad
