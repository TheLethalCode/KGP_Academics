 Dhaka, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com)  The police Thursday arrested former prime minister Khaleda Zia's adviser ASM Hannan Shah at the gate of Narayanganj jail, shortly after he was freed on bail. Fatullah police arrested him on charges of violating emergency rules and took him to the court of additional chief judicial magistrate Golam Mahbub. The court ordered him to jail. Sub-inspector Bhuiyan Mahbub Hasan, who filed a case against him with Fatullah Police Station Thursday, told the court that Hannan Shah had held a rally with about 200 party workers near the jail gate soon after his release from prison. The police alleged that the rally breached emergency rule. "The rally spread panic among people and halted traffic on the road past Narayanganj jail," the SI said. In court, Hannan Shah denied joining any rally and said the case filed against him was false. The BNP leader told the court: "I am a retired army officer and a former minister. I am a member of a political party. Up to eight plainclothes security officials took me to court by microbus shortly after I left the jail. I did not join any rally. I did not violate any emergency powers rule. If I had attended any rally, reporters would have known it." His lawyer Advocate Shakhawat Hossain Khan told bdnews24.com: "There was no rally and there was no traffic jam." Hannan Shah was earlier arrested on Nov 7 for his alleged links to violence near former president Ziaur Rahman's grave in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar on National Revolution and Solidarity Day. On Jan 30, the High Court declared illegal his detention and granted him bail. bdnews24.c
