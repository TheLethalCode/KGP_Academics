 Dhaka, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com)  US Charge d'Affaires Geeta Pasi Thursday said her country wanted Bangladesh to restore democracy as soon as possible. "It's important in our views that the country should return to democracy as soon as possible," Geeta Pasi told reporters after a meeting with law adviser AF Hassan Ariff. She stressed that elections would enable countrymen to choose their leaders and restore democracy. Pasi said the country would return to democracy as soon as the polls were held. The job of the government was to bring democracy to the country through a free and fair election, she added. Pasi reiterated that the present government has US support in implementing the election roadmap and the US government welcomed the pledge of the chief adviser on the issue. The US envoy asked the government to ensure a free, fair and credible election by preparing the election-related agencies for the polls. Pasi did not make any direct comment on the High Court ruling of canceling and declaring illegal the Azam J Chowdhury case against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina under the emergency powers rules. She said they wanted the cases be disposed of through a due process. bdnews24.co
