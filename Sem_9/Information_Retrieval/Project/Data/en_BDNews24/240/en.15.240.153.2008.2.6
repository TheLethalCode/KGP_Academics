 Dhaka, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Under-19 team Wednesday clinched the one-dayer series 2-1 against the West Indies counterparts when the hosts handed a 52-run defeat to the visitors in the fourth and final match at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. The four-match series was arranged for both sides ahead of this month's ICC U/19 World Cup in Malaysia. Bangladesh bundled the West Indies out for 180 in 47.4 overs after making a fighting total of 232 for seven in the stipulated 50 overs. After being put in to bat first, the home side crossed the 200-mark riding on three knocks from Nadimuddin Mintu (49) Saikat Ali (49) and Rony Talukdar (59 not out). The West Indies, in reply, were reduced to 34 for three before skipper Brooks rescued his side to contribute 52. But, it was not enough for the tourists to reach the target as Bangladesh skipper Suhrawardi Shuvo wrapped the tail with three for 26 after pacer Shubhashis Roy rattled the top order taking four for 27. Golam Kibriya chipped in with two for 31. Bangladesh, who lost the second match by 73 runs after the first match was abandoned due to wet outfield, bounced back in the series with a four-wicket win over the West Indies in the third match Monday.
