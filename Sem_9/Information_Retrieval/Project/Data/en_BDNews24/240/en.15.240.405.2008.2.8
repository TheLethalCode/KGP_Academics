 Kirkwood, Mo., Feb 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A gunman killed two police officers and three city officials on Thursday night when he stormed into a city council meeting in a suburb of St. Louis, police said. The gunman, who was later shot dead by police, killed one police officer in the parking lot outside City Hall in Kirkwood and another inside the building. He rushed into the council meeting and began shooting people, including council officials and Mayor Mike Swoboda, who suffered a gunshot wound to the head and was in critical condition, police said. "He shot three other people who were attending the council meeting. They also are deceased," the St. Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper quoted Officer Tracy Panus as saying. Two of the dead were council members and the other was an engineer, police said. Witnesses said the gunman was a middle-aged local contractor who had feuded with the city council in the past and had twice been arrested for disrupting meetings in 2006. Local television station KMOV-TV interviewed the brother of the suspected gunman, who was identified as 52-year-old Charles Thornton. "My brother went to war tonight with the people and government that were putting torment and strife into his life and he ended it," Gerald Thornton said. "I'm OK with it." Kirkwood is an upscale suburb around 15 miles (24 km) southwest of St Louis.
