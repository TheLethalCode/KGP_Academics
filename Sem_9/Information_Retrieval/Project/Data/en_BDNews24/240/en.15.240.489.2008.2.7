 LONDON, Feb 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England's 2-1 victory over Switzerland in Fabio Capello's first game in charge drew a guarded response from British newspapers on Thursday.

"Now Fabio Capello knows why he's earning six million pounds ($11.78 million) a year" said another headline, with a report suggesting there were periods of the game that looked worryingly like the 3-2 defeat by Croatia that ended Steve McClaren's reign as coac
