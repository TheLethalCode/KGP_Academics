 Dhaka, Feb 6 (bdnews24.com)  Artist Debdas Chakraborty died at his Uttara home Tuesday afternoon at the age of 75. The award-winning painter had been suffering from a number of medical complications. His body will be taken to the Institute of Fine Arts and then to Central Shahid Minar for public viewing, before his funeral on Thursday. Debdas contributed to the Independence War by designing a poster that was a great inspiration to freedom fighters. The artist entered Calcutta Art College in 1948, but could not complete his course for political reasons. He was later admitted to Dhaka Art College (the present Institute of Fine Arts). Here, Debdas had the opportunity to be close to the prominent artists of the institute at the time, including Zainul Abedin, Safiuddin Ahmed and Kamrul Hassan. Debdas graduated with a BFA in 1956. From 1977 to 1979, he trained in the art of printmaking with a Polish government scholarship. The artist was an activist of left-leaning politics during his student days and bore those ideals throughout his life in his work. He worked as a senior designer at Information Directorate under the Ministry of Agriculture 1958 to 1970, and worked under artist Kamrul Hassan at the Information Directorate of the makeshift government of Bangladesh during the liberation war. Debdas was an assistant professor in the fine arts department at Chittagong University from 1970 to 1980 and won art awards at home and abroad during his career. Born in Shariatpur, he left two sons, relatives and many well wishers to mourn him. Students and teachers of the Institute of Fine Arts, Jessore's SM Art College and Bengal Gallery of Fine Arts expressed grief at the death of the famous artist. bdnews24
