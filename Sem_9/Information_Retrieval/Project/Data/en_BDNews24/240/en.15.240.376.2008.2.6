<TITLE> Merkel's party treads thin ice ahead of state vote </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 HAMBURG, Germany, Feb 6 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU), shaken by heavy losses in a state election last week, face a further setback later this month when the prosperous port city of Hamburg votes. Polls show the CDU's Ole von Beust, in power since 2001, will lose his absolute majority in Hamburg but could hold power by tying up with the Greens, a first time combination at a state level which could serve as a model for the federal government. A drop in support for the CDU in the Feb. 24 vote in Hamburg would be a worry for Merkel in the run up to 2009's federal election, especially after the losses in Hesse, say analysts. "The Hamburg vote is important as a barometer of public sentiment," said political scientist Karl-Heinz Nassmacher at the University of Oldenburg. Von Beust, a 52-year-old trained lawyer, is adopting a softly-softly approach to distance himself from Roland Koch whose divisive campaign in the western state of Hesse, focusing on crime and immigration and backed by Merkel, backfired. The losses in Hesse, where it is still unclear which parties will form a coalition, unleashed a wave of recriminations in the CDU and support for the party nationwide has dived 4 percentage points to 35 percent, a Forsa poll showed on Wednesday. The Social Democrats (SPD), who share power in Merkel's awkward coalition, are down 2 percent at 25 percent. "The problem in Hesse was a polarizing election campaign and I don't want a polarizing election campaign here," von Beust told reporters in Hamburg's opulent town hall. In Hamburg, home to Europe's second biggest port and a big Airbus plant, candidates are focusing on the local economy with the CDU promising more jobs and the SPD vowing to distribute wealth more evenly. GREEN TIES The jobless rate in Hamburg, around 8 percent, is on par with the national average and all candidates are campaigning hard in the south of the city where boutiques and luxury hotels give way to boarded up shops and concrete housing blocks. Hamburg, an SPD stronghold until 2001, is also seeing a rise in support for the Left Party, a group of ex-communists and former SPD supporters, whose success in Hesse has thrown the coalition-building process into turmoil. The more inclusive tone of the Hamburg campaign is allowing candidates to keep their options open for after the election. Polls suggest the CDU's preferred partner, the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) are unlikely to enter the state parliament. A coalition with Social Democrat candidate Michael Naumann, second in the polls, also looks unlikely, leaving the unusual possibility of a partnership between the CDU and Greens. "This combination would break a taboo in German politics and would be very important for the CDU at a national level," said Dietmar Herz, political scientist at Erfurt University. Christa Goetsch, the Green candidate for state premier in Hamburg, says all options are open but a tie-up could be tricky as the Greens attack the CDU's environmental record and disagree on selection in schools. But analysts say the Hamburg CDU must look at a strategic partnership with the Greens given the more complex situation caused by the emergence of the Left party as a political force.
