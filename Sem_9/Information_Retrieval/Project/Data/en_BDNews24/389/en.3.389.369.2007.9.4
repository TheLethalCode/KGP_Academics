<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 4 (bdnews24.com)  Expelled BNP leader Ashraf Hossain Tuesday called for unity among leaders and activists in a bid to save BNP from a feared collapse. The call came a day after BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia expelled Ashraf, joint secretary general, and Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, secretary general, from BNP, deepening the crisis. On the other hand, newly installed secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain urged efforts to resolve "internal problems" through "joint endeavours". Delwar told bdnews24.com: "BNP is a major political party. The party has to cross many hurdles. We will resolve the problems through our collective efforts. I hope BNP will stay united." Ashraf spoke to reporters, coming out of Mannan Bhuiyan's house, and said he was still joint secretary general of BNP. "We have rejected the expulsion order by the chairperson. She has taken a decision against the constitution of the party in critical times. This cannot be accepted," he said. "Former lawmakers and other leaders of the remote areas supported our secretary general. Some 130 leaders, including some standing committee members, rejected the decision by the chairperson," Ashraf added. Terming the chairperson's decision undemocratic, Ashraf said, "The decision did not do any good to the party. I asked leaders and activists not to get confused by it." Hoping that BNP will be stronger in future he said: "If the ban on politics is lifted, we will work to bring changes to the party. The party leaders are in the favour of reforms." Asked to comment on the appointment of Delwar as acting secretary general, Ashraf said: "I don't want to comment. We are unique, they are our people." Earlier, Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan held a meeting at his home with leaders from Comilla, Pabna, Sirajganj, Chittagong, Faridpur and Sylhet. bdnew
