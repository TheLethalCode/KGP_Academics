<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com)Eighty-four of the 302 upazila election officials appointed during the last government have failed an efficiency test taken in May and will be dismissed, the chief election commissioner said Sunday. Following the controversy over a number of upazila election officials who were alleged to have gained their appointments for political reasons during the previous BNP-led government, 302 were made to sit an efficiency test by the current Election Commission on May 18. The 218 that passed the test will remain under observation for one year, CEC ATM Shamsul Huda told reporters at a press briefing at the EC Secretariat Sunday. The test, conducted by Dhaka University's Institute of Business Administration, is of international standards, Huda said. The CEC said he had sent a letter asking the Anticorruption Commission to investigate the allegations of corruption and misuse of power against a number of officials of the Election Commission itself. The CEC reiterated that his commission wanted to see an elected government as soon as possible. "We want to complete work on a voter list by October in line with the election roadmap," Huda told reporters. "And if the voter listing is done in time, we will hold the election by 2008," he said. The EC has already completed work on voter listing with photographs in Rajshahi and Khulna city corporations, and is starting work on preparation of voter listing in three other city corporations such as Chittagong, Sylhet and Barisal. "The work of voter listing in these areas will be completed in September, October and November. We want to keep the momentum we have achieved in this work." The army is offering technical assistance in preparing of the voter list with photographs and national ID cards, including the provision of transport. Mentioning again that the EC will begin discussions on electoral reform with the political parties from September 12, Huda said: "We hope that the ban on indoor politics will be lifted by that time." "If it is, a window will be opened. If not, we will talk with the government on this matter again." bdnews24.
