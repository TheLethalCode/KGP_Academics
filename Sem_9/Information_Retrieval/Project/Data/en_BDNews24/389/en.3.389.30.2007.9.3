<TEXT>
 BEIJING, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China has launched a campaign to improve police etiquette in Beijing and other Olympic co-host cities, including bans on smoking, eating and chatting for on-duty officers, state media reported on Monday. "Police inspectors, both uniformed and plainclothes, will monitor mostly community, traffic and patrol police, to see how they behave when people ask them for help," the China Daily quoted, Wu Heping, a police ministry spokesman, as saying. "If a member of the public sees a police officer smoking, eating or chatting on duty -- all of which are regarded as harmful to the image of the police -- they can report them by dialling 110," the paper quoted Jia Chunming, a Beijing police supervision official, as saying. The campaign had been launched across the six Olympic co-host cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Qingdao, Shenyang, Tianjin and Qinhuangdao and would be rolled out to major tourist centres at the start of 2008, the paper said. It follows a directive in June banning police from wearing scarfs, jewellery, beards and "strangely dyed hair". Beijing, keen to ensure nothing mars the city's image ahead of the Olympic Games, has launched a number of etiquette drives in recent months in a bid to improve the manners and hygiene of public servants, taxi drivers and common citizens. bd
