 WASHINGTON, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Democratic presidential hopeful John Edwards won trade union backing on Monday from steelworkers and mineworkers, putting him ahead of rivals in declared union support, his campaign said. The former senator from North Carolina, endorsed by the carpenters' union on Thursday, now has the support of unions representing more than 1.8 million members and retirees, more than any other candidate in the November 2008 White House race, Edwards' campaign said.
