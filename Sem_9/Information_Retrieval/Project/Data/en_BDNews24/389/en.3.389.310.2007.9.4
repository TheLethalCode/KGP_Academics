 Dhaka, Sept 4 (bdnews24.com)  The stock market remains upbeat although risks remain due to a reliance on equity-based securities and a lack of investor scope to diversify their portfolios in the event of market corrections. Experts termed the single-asset rise "risky" at a time when the debt market remains non-functional, as only one bond traded in the last 32 months. Debentures have not traded for a considerable time either. Only mutual funds and company shares did. Of the 331 securities listed on the Dhaka Stock Exchange, 260 are companies, 49 government bonds, eight debentures and 14 are mutual funds. "The market has gone uni-modal, which is risky," said Salahuddin Ahmed Khan, chief executive of the DSE. Ahmed added: "Primary dealers do not like to sell government bonds because of their high yield. If we could activate bond trading the investors will be able to diversify their portfolios' and risks. Market resilience will also increase." Ahmed also said he hoped the bond market would get a boost after the start of some private sector bond trading. He suggested good companies issue bonds, mutual funds and preference shares. A fund manager from a primary dealer bank, preferring anonymity, said transaction costs discouraged them to join the trading. He said: "Until the bourse authority reduces transaction costs, no bond will be traded." Arif Khan, general manager of IDLC Finance, said: "The market rise is based on banks, power and some pharmaceuticals sectors only. The only way to reduce investor risk to is to increase the supply of diversified securities." The DGEN or general index remains at an all-time high of 2528.48 points. In December 2006, the DGEN stood at 1609.51 points. "In the absence of diversified securities, all investors face losses whenever the market drops. Investors in developed markets can shift to the debt market if the equity market falls," said Yawer Sayeed, who helps manage about Tk 750 million in funds. Wali-ul-Maroof Matin, resident consultant for capital markets at the Bank of Sierra Leone and former chief executive of the Chittagong Stock Exchange recently pointed out the deficiency in an article published in the CSE quarterly 'Portfolio'. "Investors deserve to have avenues to diversify the risk and invest in calculative and confident manner...We need to act fast to draw in more good shares, professionally managed mutual funds and add more knowledge t exited investors before its is too late," he said. bd
