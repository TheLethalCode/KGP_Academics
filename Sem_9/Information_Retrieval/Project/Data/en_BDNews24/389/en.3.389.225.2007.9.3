 SYDNEY, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The 21 Asia-Pacific leaders gathering this week in Sydney, a city reknowned for its beach lifestyle, can stop pulling in their stomachs -- they will not be forced to wear swimming costumes for the official photograph. At the end of each Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) summit, leaders pose for a photograph in a costume that represents the host nation. In Vietnam in 2006 the leaders dressed in full-length traditional ao dai outfits. Discussion in Australia over what the leaders, who include US President George W. Bush and Chinese President Hu Jintao, may wear has prompted a number of humorous suggestions. As Australia does not have a definitive national dress, some have suggested the leaders could be wearing swimming costumes, nicknamed "budgie smugglers" for men, and thongs or flipflops -- traditional Aussie beach attire. Others have proposed the Aussie workman's uniform -- navy blue singlets, tight shorts and steel capped boots. The most likely outfit is not inspired by the Australian beach, despite the majority of the population living on the coast, but the country's iconic rugged outback. The classic bushman's outfit consists of a rabbit-skin hat, full-length leather rain coat and leather boots. Australian Prime Minister John Howard is aware the wrong outfit would be a fashion and diplomatic faux pas. Howard remained tight-lipped on Monday about what the leaders would wear for their photograph -- but ruled out one outfit. "The only Australian garb I'd rule out is Speedos (swimming costumes) and thongs (flip flops)," Howard told local television. "I don't think I'd do that, that wouldn't be very diplomatic." "It will be very Australian. Think Australian in a very positive way, one we all identify with," he said. bd
