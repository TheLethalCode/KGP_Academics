 Dhaka, Sept 1 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh made a flying start in the four-nation Twenty20 tournament with an emphatic five-wicket win over hosts Kenya in their first match at Gymkhana Club ground, Nairobi, Saturday. Bangladesh raced to 139 for five with 14 balls to spare in reply to Kenya's 138 for seven in the stipulated 20 overs. Debutant Nazimuddin led from the front to make 43 off 37 balls with the help of three fours and two sixes while skipper Mohammad Ashraful fired a blazing 20-ball 36 smashing four fours and one six. Alok Kapali (17 off 19 balls) and Mashrafee Bin Mortaza (7 off 6 balls) remained unbeaten to take their side home. Opener Tamim Iqbal (11), Aftab Ahmed (17) and Mahmudullah (2) were other scorers for the visitors. Pace spearhead Mashrafee justified his captain's decision to field first, sending both Kenyan openers back to reduce the hosts to 29 for two in five overs. Kenyan skipper Steve Tikolo pairing with Tanmay Mishra repaired the damage to put on 42 runs for the third wicket before Ashraful had Tikolo (24 off 21 balls) caught by Mahmudullah, leaving the hosts to 71 for three in 11.5 overs. Mishra and Thomas Odoyo took their side to 113 for 16.2 overs before Farhad Reza bowled Odoyo for 22 off 13 balls, and in his next over Farhad removed top-scorer Mishra (38 off 41 balls).
