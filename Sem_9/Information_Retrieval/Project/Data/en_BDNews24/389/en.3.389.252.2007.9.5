 SYDNEY, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President George W Bush said on Wednesday he saw signs of progress in Iraq on both the military and political fronts and again held out the possibility of a reduction in US troop levels. But Bush said no final decisions had been made on troop levels and said he would not follow "artificial timetables" to gauge whether it was time to make reductions. "I'm not interested in artificial timetables, or dates of withdrawal. I'm interested in achieving an objective," Bush said at a joint news conference in Sydney with Australian Prime Minister John Howard ahead of the Asia-Pacific leaders' summit. Bush arrived in Sydney on Tuesday night, after making a surprise trip to Iraq that comes a week before the top US general in Iraq, David Petraeus, and US ambassador to Iraq, Ryan Crocker, are to deliver crucial testimony to the US Congress on the progress there. He said the Petraeus-Crocker recommendations would be key to helping him formulate his strategy, but stopped short of saying whether a report he will submit to Congress after their testimony would contain further specifics on troop levels. Bush saw achievements in bringing down the levels of violence and on reconciling the country's warring factions, a view much more upbeat than that of a US Congressional report on Tuesday that found still-high levels of violence and little progress on the political front. "We are achieving our objectives," Bush said. "Reconciliation is taking place and it's important, in my judgment, for the security of America and for the security of Australia that we hang in there with the Iraqis and help them," Bush said. During the news conference, Howard, a staunch ally of the US president, gave a strong pledge of support for the Iraq mission, despite the unpopularity in Australia of the war. "Our commitment to Iraq remains and Australian forces will remain at their present levels in Iraq, not based on any calendar but based on conditions on the ground," Howard declared. "Until we are satisfied that a further contribution to ensuring that the Iraqis can look after themselves cannot usefully be made by the Australian forces they will not be reduced or withdrawn." Howard is facing an uphill battle for re-election against Australian opposition leader, Kevin Rudd, who has vowed to withdraw troops from Iraq if he wins. bd
