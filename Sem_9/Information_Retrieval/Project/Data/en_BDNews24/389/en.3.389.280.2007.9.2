 Adrian Croft and Kamran Haider LONDON/ISLAMABAD, Sept 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said on Saturday talks on a power sharing deal with President Pervez Musharraf had stalled but she would return to Pakistan within weeks even without agreement. "No understanding has been arrived at," she told a crowded news conference in London about her negotiations with Musharraf that would see him quit as army chief and stand for re-election as president, and Bhutto return to become prime minister. She said talks between her party and envoys sent by Musharraf had been 80 percent successful "but matters appear to have stalled following resistance by members of the ruling party." She said the Musharraf delegation had returned to Pakistan for consultations. Asked if talks on a deal could resume, she replied: "This is a question you need to put to them." Pakistan, a nuclear power on the front line of the West's fight against al Qaeda, is facing the risk of turmoil as Musharraf plots his course and former exiled prime ministers Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif prepare to return home. Bhutto, who has corruption charges hanging over her and could be detained upon her arrival back in Pakistan, said her party would announce the date of her return at press conferences in Pakistan on September 14. "I plan to return to Pakistan in the next few weeks to work for a moderate, democratic Pakistan that is free from the threat of terrorism and which can address the basic needs of its people," she told Reuters Television. "I feel the stage is set for the restoration of democracy and I hope to go back to play my part," she told reporters after meeting colleagues from her popular Pakistan People's Party. She told Reuters she expected to be a candidate in upcoming parliamentary elections. HARDLINERS Bhutto blamed hardliners in Musharraf's ruling party, who she said had also been promoting militant Islam, for trying to scupper the talks. Nevertheless, the two-week delay in announcing her return plans gives more time for negotiations. She said the stumbling blocks in the talks had been over the sovereignty of parliament and over the presidential and parliamentary elections. Bhutto told Sky News "the slide toward a failed state would be difficult to stop" if the political situation in Pakistan was not resolved. Musharraf was also weighing his options before a presidential election due between September 15 and October 15 that he hopes will win him another five-year term. A general election is due at the end of the year. With his popularity plummeting and challenges to his rule mounting, Musharraf must line up support and he has turned to Bhutto for help to broaden his base. Bhutto has insisted an agreement would hinge on Musharraf stepping down as chief of the army, which has ruled for more than half Pakistan's history since independence in 1947. Bhutto also wants immunity from prosecution for herself and others who served in the late 1980s and 1990s. But many members of Musharraf's ruling Pakistan Muslim League are alarmed at the prospect of their old rival Bhutto returning to take power from them. The party is rejecting parts of the proposed deal, including the lifting of a ban on a prime minister serving a third term -- which would exclude two-time prime minister Bhutto from power. The party also objects to another Bhutto demand -- that the president be stripped of the power to dismiss governments. With doubts growing about a deal with Bhutto, Musharraf is considering trying to secure the support of conservative Islamic parties. But the leader of an alliance of religious parties, Fazal-ur-Rehman, said on Saturday he would not back the president: "No democratic power will be ready to support President Musharraf in parliament." SHARIF Another looming problem for Musharraf, and Bhutto, is the return of exiled former Prime Minister Sharif, the leader Musharraf overthrew in a 1999 coup. He has said he would return on September 10 to challenge Musharraf. After he was overthrown, Sharif was sentenced to life in prison on graft and security charges. He was exiled in 2000 and could face arrest when he returns to Pakistan. Sharif's defiance of Musharraf has raised his standing among the public, some of whom have questioned Bhutto's motives for negotiating with the unpopular president. Some members of Bhutto's party also doubt the wisdom of striking a deal with Musharraf, which they say would prop up a failing dictator.
