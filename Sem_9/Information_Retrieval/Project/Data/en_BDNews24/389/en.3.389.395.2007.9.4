 BEIJING, Sept 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China on Tuesday rejected a report that hackers controlled by its military had successfully entered a Pentagon network, calling the claim a product of "Cold War" thinking. The Financial Times, citing former and serving US officials, said Chinese People's Liberation Army hackers broke into a US Defence Department network in June, taking data and prompting the shutdown of a system serving department secretary Robert Gates. The report came a week after German Chancellor Angela Merkel raised similar claims that Chinese hackers had infected German government ministries with spying programmes. China deflected the German reports, and now it has flatly rejected the US claims, as well as denying reports that Chinese-made weapons have been used by Taliban fighters in Afghanistan.

It said hackers from various locations in China had spent several months trying to tap into the system before breaching its cyber defences, forcing the Pentagon to shut down its network for more than a week. US President George W Bush is scheduled to meet Chinese President Hu Jintao in Sydney while the two leaders are there for the APEC regional summit. The FT quoted a former US official as saying the PLA was now able to disrupt and even disable the Pentagon's computer system. "The PLA has demonstrated the ability to conduct attacks that disable our system ... and the ability in a conflict situation to re-enter and disrupt on a very large scale," the former offical told the newspaper. The Financial Times reported that the Pentagon was investigating what data had been taken, and a source told the paper that most of it was probably unclassified. Spokeswoman Jiang also rejected a BBC report that Chinese-made weapons have been used by Taliban fighters in Afghanistan. London has complained to Beijing that the weapons were used in Taliban attacks on British and U.S. troops, the BBC reported, citing British officials. "This accusation is groundless," Jiang said. "The Chinese government has always been prudent and responsible in its military exports." China did not sell weapons to "non-state" entities, she sa
