<TEXT>
 LONDON, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A century from Owais Shah and some scintillating late hitting from Dimitri Mascarenhas rescued England as they set India a target of 317 to win the sixth one-day international at the Oval on Wednesday. India, trailing 3-2 in the series, seemed to be in the driving seat as England, missing injured all-rounders Andrew Flintoff and Ravi Bopara, tottered on 137 for five after Kevin Pietersen was ludicrously run out for 53. Shah was involved in Pietersen's dismissal, staying put when his partner charged back looking for a second run in the 31st over, but he shrugged off a glare from his team mate to set about launching a superb counter-attack. Shah, who finished unbeaten on 107 to register his maiden one-day century, shared a sixth wicket partnership of 106 with Sussex debutant Luke Wright who was run out after reaching his half century. With 300 a minimum requirement on a pitch perfect for run-making, England took 114 off the final 10 overs with Mascarenhas providing the fireworks. Five successive sixes in the 50th over off the hapless Yuvraj Singh left India facing a stern test to keep the series alive. Mascarenhas finished with 36 from just 15 balls. England's innings started poorly after they won the toss with both openers falling inside the first four overs. Alastair Cook edged the second ball of the day from the dangerous Zaheer Khan and Matt Prior (6) was trapped lbw by Ajit Agarkar. Ian Bell and Pietersen repaired some of the damage with a 50 partnership before Bell played across the line to young spinner Piyush Chawla and was bowled for a fluent 49 in the 15th over. Next to fall was England skipper Paul Collingwood in controversial circumstances. Pietersen called Collingwood for a risky single and the skipper was clearly in trouble as MS Dhoni whipped off the bails. Umpire Peter Hartley was unmoved until a replay of the incident showed that Collingwood was short of his crease. He then called for the third umpire and an angry Collingwood was sent packing after scoring just one run. A circumspect Pietersen looked set to get after the Indian attack when he too was run out after completing his half century. However, England recovered in stirring fashion with Wright, Shah and Mascarenhas ensuring a competitive target. India made one change to the side that won at Headingley with opener Dinesh Karthik replaced by Robin Uthap
