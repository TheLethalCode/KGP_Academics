 Rajshahi, Sept 1 (bdnews24.com) -- The three Rajshahi University teachers, ordered to jail after an eight-day remand, were rushed to the jail hospital on arrival Saturday. "The arrested teachers have fallen sick," said major Hafizur Rahman, DIG (prisons) for Rajshahi. He told bdnews24.com that the three teachers were "physically unwell". They were given first aid soon after their arrival at the jail. Later, they were taken to the jail hospital, Rahman said. Their family members visited them in the afternoon. The jail authorities asked the families to bring necessary medicines and clothes for the teachers. Rahman said, "The former VC Saidur Rahman Khan is a diabetic. Bringing a prescription from home would be better for him." All these arrangements were being made according to the jail code, Rahman said, adding that they would be provided with division in jail if the jail code permitted. Court inspector Mahbubul Quddus Siddiqui told bdnews24.com: "After interrogation, the three teachers were sent to jail by the metropolitan magistrate court (Rajshahi). I have heard that the charge-sheet against them is almost ready." Security forces arrested Saidur Rahman Khan, Progressive Teachers' Community convener Abdus Sobhan and associate professor of management Moloy Kumar Bhowmik on Aug 24 following protests on campus. The case against them was filed under the emergency powers rules on Aug 25, and they were given a 10-day remand. However, they were kept in custody for eight days. According to newspaper reports, during their remand, the three teachers were brought to the joint interrogation cell in Dhaka and interrogated. Motihar police sub-inspector Farukh Hossain, who filed the case, told bdnews24.com: "Preparations for submitting the charge-sheet are almost complete. They will be charged with violations of the emergency powers rules." The case in question accuses a total of 2,500 people in connection with the student protests at Rajshahi University. Apart from the three detained teachers, only 30 other individualsteachers and students of the universityhave reportedly been named in the charge-sheet. bdnews24.com/corr/
