 Rajshahi, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com) -- Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed said Sunday law and order has improved significantly in recent days because of a neutral role of the police administration. With the success in the police department, the government is now trying to instil the momentum into other government entities to improve their services, Fakhruddin said. The head of the government was speaking as chief guest at a parade of the newly recruited assistant superintendents of police, at Bangladesh Police Academy at Sardah in Rajshahi. "The people expect a prosperous Bangladesh free of terrorism and corruption. The main role of the government is to materialise people's aspirations. As the torchbearer, the police department have to live up to people's expectations for the welfare of the nation," he said. The chief adviser said citizen's charters, model police stations and one-stop service centres have been introduced to enhance the quality of the department's services. He said the government was also modernising the relevant laws to catch up with the time. "Sincere supervision and monitoring have been enhanced to check corruption by police. Various reform measures are underway to improve the department's quality," he said. Fakhruddin, a former central bank governor, promised to continue to improve the quality of training, ensure accountability and increase facilities for the police officials. He hoped that the planned reforms would change the department's mindset to serve people better. Home secretary Abdul Karim, IGP Noor Mohammad, Police Academy principal Mokhlesur Rahman and other top officials attended the ceremony. A total of 150 new recruits, including 25 women officers, took part in the parade. After the parade, three fresh police officers were given citations for their special merits. They are Abdullah Al Mamun, Md Qamaruzzaman and Mohiuddin Ahmed. bdnews24.c
