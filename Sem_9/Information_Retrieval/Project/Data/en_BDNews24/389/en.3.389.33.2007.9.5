<TITLE> Kazakhstan to make statement on key oilfield </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ASTANA, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kazakhstan's government will make a statement on the future of the Eni-led Kashagan oilfield on Thursday, its prime minister said as a deadline for the Italian company to make a proposal to pay compensation expired. The news came as foreign firms charged with developing the biggest oil find in over three decades hinted they would make concessions in a row over production delays and cost overruns. The Central Asian state suspended work at Kashagan in a shallow part of the Caspian Sea last week. "Tomorrow I will address the Kazenergy conference and will talk about Kashagan," Prime Minister Karim Masimov told reporters in the capital Astana on Wednesday. "You can say that the prime minister will make a statement on Kashagan tomorrow." Deputy Finance Minister Daulet Yergozhin told Reuters on Tuesday that the government was seeking more than $10 billion in compensation for the problems at Kashagan, one of the world's biggest oil finds in three decades. Eni has yet to comment on what it may offer. A source familiar with the matter told Reuters the consortium, which also includes Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil Corp, Total, ConocoPhillips and Japan's Inpex Holdings Inc, was likely to give ground. "The consortium will want to make some concessions," the source at a company in the group developing the field said. "But they are limited in what they can do." Total Chief Executive Christophe de Margerie said the firm accepted the "environment has changed" around the project. Kashagan lies at the heart of Kazakhstan's plans to join the world's top 10 oil producers and is set to double the former Soviet state's crude output over the next decade. Kazakhstan is seen by the European Union as a major source of non-OPEC, non-Russian supply. But Kashagan has been beset by problems. Production has been postponed to the second half of 2010 from 2005 originally and, according to the government, total costs have escalated from $57 billion to $136 billion. The consortium developing Kashagan also includes Kazakh state oil and gas company KazMunaiG
