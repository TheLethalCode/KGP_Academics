<TITLE> After 14 years, Myanmar agrees charter outline </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 YANGON Mon Sep 3, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Myanmar's military junta completed the first stage of drawing up a new constitution on Monday after 14 years working out the broad outline of what it terms "discipline-flourishing democracy", a delegate said. However, it remained totally unclear when the generals who have ruled the former Burma for the last 45 years will actually appoint a drafting committee to sit down and write the new charter.

The commander-in-chief of the army will be the most powerful man in the country, with the power to appoint the ministers of defense, interior and border affairs. He will also be able to assume power "in times of emergency". Opposition parties such as Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's National League of Democracy (NLD) have boycotted most of the convention's proceedings since it started in 1993. "The National Convention cannot be seen in any way to be promoting democracy or stability in a future Union of Myanmar," one Yangon-based diplomat said.
