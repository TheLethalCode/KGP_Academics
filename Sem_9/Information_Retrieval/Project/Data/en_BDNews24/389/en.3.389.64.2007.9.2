 KATHMANDU, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Three near-simultaneous blasts killed two women and wounded 21 people in Kathmandu on Sunday, Nepal's police said, the first since a peace process ended a Maoist revolt in the Himalayan nation in May last year. The attacks came less than three months before the impoverished nation, sandwiched between Asian giants India and China, votes to elect a new constituent assembly to decide the fate of the monarchy the Maoists want abolished. One of the blasts occurred outside a school and near the newly built United World Trade Centre business complex in the Tripureswor area in the centre of Nepal's capital. Another occurred less than a mile away in the central Sundhara area outside some shops, while the third took place in a mini-bus outside the gates of an industrial park in Balaju, a northwestern suburb. No group claimed responsibility for the attacks and police had no immediate suspects. "The two dead are women, and the number of injured now is 21," said a police officer, who did not want to be named as he is not authorised to speak to the media. A witness at the site of one of the city centre blasts said he saw many people falling to the ground. "I was cycling to work when I heard a big explosion ... Soon I saw people falling down," said Sunil Maharjan. "I put three students who were injured in a taxi and took them to the hospital." Padam Bahadur Magar, the driver of a city bus carrying 70 passengers in Tripureswor, said the blast took place just as he stopped the vehicle. "It was a big explosion, the windows of my bus were shattered and the bus was damaged. Some of my passengers were injured," he said. Another witness said he saw school text books and pens scattered on the bloodstained ground. Police stepped up security in the ancient, temple-studded city and the surrounding valley areas. The blasts shattered a long spell of peace in Kathmandu Valley, which began after the Maoists and the government reached a truce last year, ending a decade-long insurgency that killed about 13,000 people. During the conflict, the Maoists frequently targeted Kathmandu with small bombs, planting them at busy streets, in markets, shopping malls and government buildings. The Maoists have since surrendered their arms, which have been stored under U.N. supervision, and about 31,000 of their former fighters have been housed in 28 camps around the country under a peace deal with the interim, multi-party government. The Maoists have also joined an interim parliament and an interim cabinet in the run-up to the elections due on Nov. 22. The peace deal was reached after the Maoists and mainstream political parties joined hands to launch a pro-democracy movement, forcing King Gyanendra to step down and hand power back to the parties after weeks of violent protests. However, scores of people have died elsewhere across the country this year, particularly in the southern plains, in violence by small armed groups and by an ethnic group of Madhesi people who are demanding more government jobs, more seats in parliament and autonomy for their Terai region. Besides, some Maoists have also been angry with their commanders for what they say is the poor condition of their camps. About 1,000 unhappy former rebels had left one camp in the southwest of the country, a report said last mon
