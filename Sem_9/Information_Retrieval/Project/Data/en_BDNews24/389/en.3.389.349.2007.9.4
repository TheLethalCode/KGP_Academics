<TITLE> Iajuddin to continue as president: Mainul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 4 (bdnews24.com)  Law adviser Mainul Hosein Tuesday said Iajuddin Ahmed would continue as president in line with the constitution. "He (Iajuddin) will continue as before," Mainul told bdnews24.com by phone. The adviser referred to the constitution saying it spells out clearly that the president "shall continue to hold office until his successor enters upon his office". Iajuddin was installed as president on Sept 5, 2002, after the exit of president AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury. Since the term of office for the president runs for five years, Iajuddin's tenure would have expired Wednesday (if his term had not been extended). Iajuddin will have to continue until the next parliament session begins. Experts, giving their views on the issue, said that as per the constitution there was no scope for electing a new president without a parliament. Referring to the constitution, Dr Kamal Hossain said: "There is no time limit. The president shall continue until his successor takes over." Dr M Zahir told bdnews24.com: "There is no parliament now. So, amending the constitution is not possible. Electing someone else by amending the constitution is not possible either." Barrister Shafiq Ahmed expressed similar views. bdne
