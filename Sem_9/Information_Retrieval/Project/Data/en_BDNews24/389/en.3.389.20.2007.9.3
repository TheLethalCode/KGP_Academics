 Dhaka, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh returned to the winning form with a 3-2 win over Sri Lanka in their third match of Pool B of Asia Cup Hockey at the Radhakrishnan Memorial Stadium in Chennai Monday. With the second win in three matches, Bangladesh took a sweet revenge of their 1-0 SA Games loss to the same rivals, and take on holders India on Tuesday. Bangladesh, who Saturday failed to convert their penalty corners against China that caused them to go down 6-0, utilised the penalty corners and stroke to leave the field with smiling faces. Striker Russel Mahmud Jimy, who was later adjudged man of the match, gave Bangladesh a four-minute lead converting the penalty corners, and Sri Lanka restored the parity four minutes from breather through a Hettiarachchi field goal. With a 1-1 lock in the first half, Bangladesh reorganised mounting pressure on the emerald islands and defender M Mamun put Bangladesh ahead in the 46th minute converting a penalty stroke. Three minutes later, Zahidul Islam Rajon converted another penalty corner to make the Bangladesh margin 3-1 before Panditharathne reduced the margin in the 58th minute.
