<TITLE> Arab League's Moussa warns on planned peace meeting </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CAIRO, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa said on Wednesday that a planned Palestinian-Israeli peace conference that fails would pose a threat to Arab interests and regional stability. Speaking at the opening of a meeting of Arab League foreign ministers in Cairo, Moussa echoed comments made by Egypt a day earlier, warning of the negative repercussions that would follow from a failure of the meeting. "A meeting convened as a political demonstration, devoid of real substance, will not just be useless, but will be profoundly harmful to Arab interests and the regional situation," he said. Since US President George W. Bush announced the conference idea, the United States has done little to bridge the gap between the Israelis and Palestinians, diplomats say. Moussa said that Israel appeared to want to make the meeting, slated for November, devoid of substance, and that Arabs had to forcefully resist any attempt to lower the ceiling of expectations to avoid further deterioration in the issue. He said a serious meeting required the attendance of all Arab states directly concerned -- an apparent reference to Syria, thus far uninvited -- and that the meeting be based upon the peace initiative adopted by Arab countries in 2002 and relevant United Nations resolutions. The meeting should address substantive issues, such as an Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab land, the dismantling of Jewish settlements, the establishment of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital and culminating in Arab recognition of Israel and normal relations with Israel, he said. "We support President Bush's proposal for a world conference on the Middle East peace process, as long as the objective requirements for convening it and its success are available," Moussa said.
