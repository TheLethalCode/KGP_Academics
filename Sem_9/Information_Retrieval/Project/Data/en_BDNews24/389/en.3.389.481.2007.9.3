<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com)Acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman Monday refrained from making any detailed comment over the arrest of former prime minister Khaleda Zia but said she had a right to justice. Speaking to reporters at his Gulshan home in the afternoon, he faced a barrage of questions but the veteran leader only commented: "As a citizen of the country Khaleda Zia has the right to justice." He refused however to compare Sheikh Hasina's case with that of Khaleda's. "I don't want to make any more comment on this matter," he said, after Khaleda was arrested and ordered to special jail pending trial. Nevertheless, he did express his dissatisfaction over the government's action, saying many corrupt leaders of the BNP were still enjoying amnesty. "I want those people who indulged in massive corruption over last five years to be held accountable," he said. He was also not happy with what the fact that there was no visible action against Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh. "No case is being filed against Jamaat. It is a matter of regret for us that they are moving around freely," he said. On whether Khaleda was arrested to maintain political balance Zillur said: "It would be ridiculous to compare the two." Zillur, a former LGRD minister during Awami League's five-year term in 1996-2001, claimed Hasina had ensured "good governance" during her days in office. "On the other hand, the people in power in the past five years have just ruined the country. They gave nothing but pervasive corruption." About the latest bribery charges against Hasina, Zillur said the charges were "ridiculous". "People won't believe these allegations," he said. The Anticorruption Commission filed a fourth case against Hasina Sunday, accusing her of taking Tk 3 crore in bribes from a power company. Hasina has also been facing three other cases on charges on extortion. bdnews24.com/sum/m
