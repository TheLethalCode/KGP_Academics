 GENEVA, Sept 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The World Health Organisation said on Tuesday thousands of people had fallen ill with cholera in northern Iraq, but the cause of the outbreak had not been identified.

Polluted well water was also cited as a possible infection source. In Kirkuk, cracked water pipes allowing contamination by sewage were blamed for the outbreak. According to the WHO Web site, sudden large outbreaks of cholera are usually caused by a contaminated water supply. The diarrhoeal disease, which also causes severe vomiting, is rarely transmitted by direct person-to-person contact. Chaignat said it appeared that the number of cases in Sulaimaniya may have been decreasing over the past week, but stressed it was possible that cholera would continue to spread. She said health workers in the region "so far" have had the resources they need to confront the outbreak.
