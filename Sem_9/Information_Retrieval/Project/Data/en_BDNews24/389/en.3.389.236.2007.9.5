 Dhaka, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com)  About 150,000 Urdu-speaking people, who are often called stranded Pakistanis, will get the voting right and national identity cards, a home ministry spokesman said Wednesday. It means once they would get the voting rights and ID cards they will automatically become the citizens of the country, according to the constitution. A final decision may come in 15 days from now, spokesman Shahinoor Miah told reporters after a high-profile meeting. A file on Wednesday's approval will go to the law ministry for scrutiny, Miah said. According to the official statistics, currently about 300,000 such peoplemost of them originally came from the Indian state of Bihar during the split of India and Pakistan with the fall of British colonial rule in 1947. The decision came after chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda had sent a proposal to chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed to settle the issue of the "stranded Pakistanis". The so-called stranded Pakistanis have never seen or visited Pakistan. In his letter to the chief adviser, the CEC said two streams of Urdu-speaking people were found in Bangladesh immediately after the independence of Bangladesh. One group, known as "stranded Pakistanis", had sworn their allegiance to Pakistan and wanted to go back there at any cost. Others swore their allegiance to Bangladesh and blended in with the mainstream society. Of the 300,000 Urdu-speaking people living in Bangladesh, some 160,000 live in 116 camps set up by the International Committee of Red Cross in different parts of the country. Miah said Wednesday the Urdu-speaking people, who still want to go to Pakistan, will not get the voting right and the national identity cards. He explained that those who were born in Bangladesh or expressed their allegiance to Bangladesh would get the citizenship. The government will take its final decision soon since time is running out to prepare the electoral roll and the national identity card. According to Article 122 of the Bangladesh constitution a person shall be entitled to be enrolled on the electoral roll for a constituency delimited for the purpose of election to the parliament, if he is mainly a citizen of Bangladesh, is not less than 18 years of age. The group, which campaigns for repatriation to Pakistan, declined to comment on the new decision immediately. "We'll sit to review the decision and then we'll give our official statement," Abdul Jabbar Khan, president of the Stranded Pakistanis General Repatriation Committee, told bdnews24.com by phone. bdnews24
