 MONTE CARLO, Sep 01 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - AC Milan midfielder Andrea Pirlo said after his side's 3-1 Super Cup victory over Sevilla on Friday that it had been difficult to play football following the death of Antonio Puerta this week. The versatile left-sided Sevilla midfielder died at the age of 22 in a Seville hospital three days after collapsing during his team's first league match of the season against Getafe. "We all had Puerta in mind, it was difficult to play this match," Pirlo, who won the man-of-the-match award, told a news conference. "But we did our best despite the tragic circumstances." AC Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti said: "We deserved to win. It was an intense game. Sevilla played better in the first half but we prevailed after the interval. "Of course, all of this was overshadowed by Puerta's death." His Sevilla counterpart Juande Ramos said that following the death of Puerta his team had had no time to gear up for the match. "Obviously, given the circumstances, we did not have time to prepare," he said. "During the first half, we made a lot of effort to be at Milan's level but their second goal eventually put the result beyond doubt. "After such a hard week, it is clear that we had some difficulties playing football.
