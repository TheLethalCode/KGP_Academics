<TEXT>
 VENICE, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - "Help Me Eros", a new film from Taiwan, explores loneliness, suicide and our obsession with money and sex, all through a haze of marijuana smoke. Lee Kang-Sheng wrote, directed and starred in the drama, in which he plays Ah Jie, a young Taiwanese man who loses his fortune gambling on the stock exchange and seeks solace in acrobatic sex with provocatively dressed young women working in a nearby betel-nut stall. Depressed and contemplating taking his own life, he calls a helpline and becomes obsessed by the girl who comforts him. In his apartment above a busy street, Ah nurtures his own marijuana plants in a cupboard and encourages them to grow by reciting verses from the Bible over them. Smoking joint after joint, Ah is determined to block out the real world around him. Lee said the film was partially based on his own life. "It is about the darkest period of my life so far," he said in production notes for the film, which is in competition at the Venice film festival. "I had put all my money that I'd earned from acting into the stock market and lost everything. The thought of suicide occurred to me. I tried calling the helpline many times, but could never get through -- luckily I didn't kill myself." Lee said that without money people felt worthless in a society obsessed about making the first million or 10 million. "That's why we feel such a great sense of failure when we are unable to achieve that." At a news conference after a screening of the film, Lee said he struggled both to raise funds for the movie and to find actresses willing to perform the daring sex scenes on camera. In one, the helpline employee seeks sexual pleasure by taking a bath full of eels. "My world is the East, and sex is something which is very difficult to talk about," Lee explained. "Many young people, because of their image, could not in fact accept these rules and didn't want to uncover themselves," he said, speaking through a translator." In the end he hired actress Yin Shin and a group of girls known as the "female F4" who are popular on Taiwanese television. "Every one of the F4 girls cried after shooting their lovemaking scenes," he said. Lee teams up with long-term professional partner Tsai Ming-Liang, executive producer of "Help Me Eros" ("Bang Bang Wo Aishen"). Tsai has directed Lee in a series of films over the last 15 or so years. Tsai said he saw the stall girls as reflecting how people today give little thought to where their fuel and food comes from. "They ... believe that the earth has an endless supply of fuel, endless forests for us to cut down and endless food for us to consume," he said. "The sensitivity of this film lies in its extreme tragedy. We are all on a path of no return. What can we d
