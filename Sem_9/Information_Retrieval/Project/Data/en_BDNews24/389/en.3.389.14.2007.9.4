 PARIS, Sept 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cecilia Sarkozy, wife of French President Nicolas Sarkozy, has rejected calls to appear before a parliamentary commission to explain her role in securing the release of six foreign medics from a Libyan jail.

"Colonel Gaddafi had in front of him a woman devoting herself exclusively to the children at Benghazi hospital, which I visited, to the families of the victims, whom I met, to the imprisoned nurses and doctor," she said. She went to Libya to save lives and had not focused too much on the complexities of international diplomacy, she said, adding: "I won't be prevented from trying to help or to relieve misery in the world, wherever it may b
