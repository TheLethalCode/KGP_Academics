<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com)  Tarique Rahman, son of former prime minister Khaleda Zia, appealed to the High Court Sunday to include his undisclosed income as taxable by the National Board of Revenue. A bench of Justice Md Abdur Rashid and Justice Miftah Uddin Chowdhury is likely to hear Monday the writ petition, filed by Tarique's lawyer Advocate Ahmed Azam Khan. Barrister Mahbubuddin Khokon will attend the hearing on behalf of Tarique, also BNP's senior joint secretary general. The appeal says Tarique asked the NBR on July 29 to accept Tk 5 lakh as income tax on his undisclosed income of Tk 21 lakh. But the NBR refused. He made several attempts through courier services and jail authorities to send his application to the NBR, but the tax authority would not accept it. Joint forces arrested him at his Shaheed Mainul Road home in Dhaka cantonment on March 7. bdnews
