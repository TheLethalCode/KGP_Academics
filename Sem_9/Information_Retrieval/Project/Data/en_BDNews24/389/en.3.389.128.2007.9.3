<TEXT>
 MELBOURNE, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Captain Ricky Ponting was absent from the Australia squad that headed to South Africa for the Twenty20 World Cup on Monday, with Cricket Australia citing 'family reasons' for his absence. CA Chief Executive James Sutherland said "a private family issue" had arisen at the weekend for the 32-year-old skipper, and a decision on his participation in the inaugural ICC tournament would be taken by the end of the week. "The situation is expected to be clearer later in the week, at which time Ponting's availability would be re-assessed," Sutherland said in a statement on Monday. "Any decision on whether or not a squad replacement is needed will be assessed at that time as well." Sutherland said Adam Gilchrist would head the squad in Ponting's absence. "Our captain is obviously disappointed not to be with the team for the start of the tour and has asked if his privacy could be respected in the meantime." All-rounder Shane Watson was also missing from the Sydney flight after developing hamstring soreness during training over the weekend. "He will remain in Brisbane and will be monitored over the next two to three days with the view of him joining the squad later in the week, if he improves sufficiently," team physiotherapist Alex Kountouris said. Seam bowler Stuart Clark is remaining in Australia to care for his ill son but is expected to join the squad later in the week, the CA statement said.
