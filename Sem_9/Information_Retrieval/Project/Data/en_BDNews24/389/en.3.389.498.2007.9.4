 Dhaka, Sep 4 (bdnews24.com)  BNP's new secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain Tuesday said his party would not join dialogue with the Election Commission on reforms until Khaleda Zia was released. "It's not possible for us to sit with the Election Commission until she is freed," Delwar told reporters, a day after the former prime minister was arrested in a corruption case filed by the Anticorruption Commission. The arrest of Khaleda brought to the forefront a broader divide in the BNP, taking it into a far deeper crisis. Expelled BNP leader Ashraf Hossain called for unity among leaders and activists in a bid to save the party from a feared collapse. The call came a day after Khaleda expelled Ashraf, joint secretary general, and Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, secretary general, from the BNP. On the other hand, Delwar urged efforts to resolve "internal problems" through "joint endeavours". "BNP is a major political party. The party has to cross many hurdles. We will resolve the problems through our collective efforts. I hope BNP will stay united," he told bdnews24.com. Delwar told reporters at his NAM flat residence: "Those expelled cannot claim to be in the BNP. The question of any BNP member siding with them doesn't arise. Mannan Bhuiyan knows the party constitution well. There is no scope for rejecting the decision of expulsion." Bhuiyan Wednesday starts meeting BNP executive committee members and former lawmakers and district leaders in Dhaka in phases to explain the overall situation. Tuesday morning, the leaders from Madaripur, Sylhet, Chittagong, Pabna, Comilla and Rajshahi including senior leaders met Bhuiyan at his Gulshan home. They expressed support to the leadership of Bhuiyan. The leaders rejected the chairperson's decision on expulsion. One of the leaders told bdnews24.com: "BNP is not a private company. The chief of the party cannot do whatever she wants. For this, we want reform to BNP." Ashraf also spoke to reporters, coming out of Bhuiyan's home, and said he was still joint secretary general of BNP. "We have rejected the expulsion order by the chairperson. She has taken a decision against the constitution of the party in critical times. This cannot be accepted," he said. "Former lawmakers and other leaders of the remote areas supported our secretary general. Some 130 leaders, including some standing committee members, rejected the decision by the chairperson," Ashraf added. Terming the chairperson's decision undemocratic, Ashraf said, "The decision did not do any good to the party. I asked leaders and activists not to get confused by it." Hoping that BNP will be stronger in future he said: "If the ban on politics is lifted, we will work to bring changes to the party. The party leaders are in the favour of reforms." Asked to comment on the appointment of Delwar as secretary general, Ashraf said: "I don't want to comment. We are unique, they are our people." BNP chairperson's adviser ASM Hannan Shah told reporters at his Mohakhali DOHS home: "Madam's decision on expulsion is right. Those expelled were creating divisions within the party. They were like cancer in the party." "The party constitution has given the chairperson the power to expel anybody at her own discretion." He said, "Khaleda Zia will be freed through a legal process. The way Begum Zia was arrested was motivated. No process was followed. We are respectful to law. We will get justice." Both Hannan Shah and Delwar claimed that Bhuiyan did not have 130 executive committee members on his side. They claimed that many had telephoned them to say they were not with Bhuiyan. bdnews24
