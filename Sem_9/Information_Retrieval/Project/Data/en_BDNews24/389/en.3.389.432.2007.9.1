<TITLE> Thai penalty may wipe Huawei's profits: Reports </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com)  The Chinese telecoms gear maker Huawei Technologies may have to forego its net profit of 2007 if Communications Authority of Thailand (CAT) slams an unprecedented fine of up to 20 billion baht (US$610 million), London-based telecomtv.com said Friday. "The potential fine is for a sum almost three times that of the project's value and could wipe out Huawei's entire profit for 2007. In recent years the company has been reporting yearly profits in the $500 million - $700 million range," the report said. State-owned CAT has been accusing Huawei of late delivery in a provincial CDMA mobile network contract. It demands compensation for the "lost business opportunities" as well as the "lost commercial revenues" due to Huawei's delay. According to the Bangkok Post, the decision on the actual amount of the fine will be made on September 11. But the newspaper said citing sources "close to CAT" that Huawei's penalty could well exceed $600 million. Apparently CAT-Huawei contract has provisioned fines of 90 million baht ($2.7 million) per day. The paper, quoting "impeccable sources" further adds that CAT will also set a deadline for payment and will sue Huawei if the fine is not paid timely. The CAT network in question is designed to cover about 50 northern, north-eastern and southern provinces of Thailand and to complement an existing joint venture with Hutchison that provides service in Bangkok and around 25 central provinces of the country. According to the Bangkok Post, the fine covers two separate issues  delays in the installation of some 800 base stations that should have been operational in January this year and the late delivery of software as a result of chipset delays. "The normally secretive Huawei went public on Monday and issued a statement saying it believed the two issues are entirely separate and that the company should not be held to be liable for the delay in base station deployment as that has been dues in the main to bad weather," the telecomtv.com report said. In a swift riposte, CAT director Air Vice-Marshal Piriya Siriboon said the amount of the fine will be based on lost business opportunities and lost commercial revenues as the result of late delivery. "We have finally agreed that Huawei was in breach of contract for delivery of work that is incomplete." Air Vice-Marshal Piriya also said the CAT board has set up two working committees to study technical problems, legal issues and penalties based on daily fines. He added, ''An official amount of the fine will be settled on September 11 based on all terms of the original contracts.'' Huawei has argued that it installed all the base stations on time, but CAT says that whilst they may have been physically in place they weren't operational but were defective. "The link function is just now properly working more than seven months after the deadline, whilst the delay in data software installation has a significant impact on our ability to promote television on mobiles and high-speed application downloads," the Air-Vice Marshal told the Thai media. bdn
