 LONDON, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hundreds of people attended a vigil on Sunday in memory of Rhys Jones, the 11-year-old Liverpool schoolboy gunned down on his way home from playing football. His parents, Stephen and Melanie, and his older brother lit a candle in the pouring rain at the service at Croxteth Country Park. Dignitaries, religious figures and the police repeated appeals for anyone with information to come forward. Sixteen people have been arrested over the murder, but no charges have been brought. Twelve have been bailed, including four people arrested last Friday, and four others have been released without charge, police said. Rhys died when he was shot in the neck in a pub car park in the Croxteth area of the city on August 22. Police are searching for a youth seen on a BMX bicycle in the area at the time. A friend of Rhys, Louis Ainscough, read a short prayer at the vigil. "Help us to remember the good and happy things about him and please comfort all who are unhappy," he said. The vigil also remembered all victims of gun crime, in particular children. Rhys's funeral will take place on Thursday.
