<TITLE> Trescothick talks of 'stress-related illness' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former England opening batsman Marcus Trescothick has spoken openly about the stress-related illness that has stalled his international career. The 31-year-old has not played for England since withdrawing from the tours to India and Australia last year. "It's always branded as a stress-related illness. I'm not mentally ill, that's for sure," he told the Scotland on Sunday newspaper. "It all came from the build-up of playing and training, practising and being away from home. It's a combination of different things and the constant grind of being away from home all the time." Trescothick has been playing for his county side Somerset this season but acknowledged his condition could affect him while at the crease. "You're stuck in the middle, a ground somewhere, (thinking) I'm not sure if I want to do this, I'm not happy about doing this. It's a constant fear." Trescothick said he would only return to international duty if he was completely ready. "I'm not going to put myself through it because I know what it's like to be there (on the pitch) and I know what it's like to be playing for England, and as much as I want to do that I'm not going to sacrifice my health. "I haven't got anything to prove. I watch it on TV now and think: 'Just give me that chance again', but I'm not going to do it until in my mind I am 100 percent and I have to be certain." Trescothick averages almost 44 in 76 tests and more than 37 in 123 one-day internationals
