<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 3 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia Monday said false cases had been filed against her to split the party and destroy her family. Khaleda alleged that she was a victim of conspiracy and asked the people to pray for her. "Pray for me so that I can work for you in future as I did in the past." Standing for 20 minutes in the courtroom, she told the court, "I was asked to leave the country, but I did not. I love the country. If I had gone, I would not have faced cases." Terming her late husband and slain president Ziaur Rahman the proclaimer of independence, Khaleda said: "I am the wife of the declarer of the liberation war. "The Zia family has no greed. I do not need money. The same holds true for my sons. We love the country." The BNP chief protested her innocence and said, "These cases have been filed to harass me. They are totally false and baseless." "Today, they are conspiring not only against me, but also against the country. They are engaged in plotting against the BNP," she said to the court of metropolitan magistrate ABM Abdul Fattah "BNP is the party of the people of the country. If elections are held now, BNP will undoubtedly win." She pleaded to the court for justice. "The court is the last shelter for people. I want justice, so does my son. You will see to it that not only me, but also no man is harassed in such way. Many are being harassed after being charged in false cases." Her son Arafat Rahman Coco stood beside her. bdnews24.co
