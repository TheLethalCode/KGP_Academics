 MINSK, Sept 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Four Belarussian army officers went on trial behind closed doors in the ex-Soviet state on Tuesday charged with spying for Poland, a European Union member viewed with suspicion by President Alexander Lukashenko. The accused could, in theory, face the death penalty under Belarussian law if convicted of espionage and treason, though there are no known instances of the penalty having been applied. A fifth Russian officer is to face charges in his home country. "Four people are to appear before the court and each is charged with gathering and transferring to a foreign state data sought by foreign intelligence," a court representative said before the hearing opened. "One of the accused is also accused of organising spying activity by a foreign national."

Belarus and Poland, a close US ally, have long had uneasy relations over Lukashenko's allegations that the 400,000-strong Polish minority foments unrest in the country of 10 million. In 2005, Belarussian riot police seized the Polish community's offices in the western city of Grodno, ousted its leaders and forced the election of more compliant executives. That incident prompted each country to expel the other's diplomats. Other incidents of alleged spying or interference have boosted tension, with Belarussian officials periodically barring entry to Polish officials. Lukashenko, popular at home, is accused in the West of crushing fundamental rights, closing down independent media and systematically rigging elections, including his own re-election last year to a third term. The United States and EU have barred entry to him and dozens of top officia
