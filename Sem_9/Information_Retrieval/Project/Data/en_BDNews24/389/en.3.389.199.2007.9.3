<TITLE> Conditions key for bowlers at Twenty20 Cup - Smith </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JOHANNESBURG, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South African captain Graeme Smith believes bowlers could play as big a role as batsmen at the inaugural Twenty20 World Cup his nation is hosting from Sept. 11. "I'm unsure whether batsmen are going to totally dominate. No one really knows what conditions are going to be like at this time of year," Smith told reporters in Johannesburg on Monday. "If they are good, then batsmen could have a field day because the ball travels far up here on the Highveld and our stadiums are smaller than elsewhere in the world. "But bowlers's skills are improving all the time and with slower balls and bouncers coming into play, I think they could have a big say as well," South Africa will open the tournament with a match against the West Indies in Johannesburg and Smith said his team was excited about launching a new format of the game on an international scale. "We're very excited, especially since we're hosting this inaugural tournament which is an awesome opportunity," he added. "From when one-day cricket started until now, it has developed a lot and it's a far different game now than when it began. "Twenty20 is just starting now and everything will be different. Tactics will obviously be important and teams are going to have to show some imagination, players who are unorthodox and can think on their feet will be crucial. "Captains will need to trust their players and allow them to go out and play." INTENSIVE WEEK South African coach Mickey Arthur said the tournament offered a great opportunity for his team to win a major International Cricket Council (ICC) event for the first time and they would limber up for the championship with an intensive week of preparation. "Graeme and I have a pretty good idea of what we want for the tournament and hopefully we will confirm that during this week. We have a pretty intensive programme lined up to assess exactly where we are," Arthur said. "We haven't won a major ICC event... and this is a huge opportunity for us to get the country behind us and to win a substantial event. It is attainable if we play to our full potential." Top-order batsman Loots Bosman, a leading performer in South African domestic Twenty20, is a doubtful starter for the tournament due to a back problem he picked up during a three-match, one-day international series in Zimbabwe 10 days ago. Arthur said a decision on Bosman was likely to come through on Monday
