 LONDON, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India beat England by two wickets to level their one-day series at the Oval on Wednesday, reaching a daunting target of 317 with two balls to spare. In a nailbiting finale India edged home when the inspired Robin Uthappa scored the 10 runs required off the last over, striking the winning boundary off Stuart Broad to finish on 47 not out. The teams now go into the seventh match at Lord's on Saturday locked at 3-3. England won the toss and elected to bat and recovered from a poor start to smash 114 off the last 10 overs of their innings, Owais Shah scoring an unbeaten 107 and Dimitri Mascarenhas belting five consecutive sixes in the last over. India made a great start to their replay with Sachin Tendulkar and Saurav Ganguly putting on 150 for the first wicket. Tendulkar fell six runs short of his century
