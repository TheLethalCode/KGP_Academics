 LONDON, Sept 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said on Saturday she had not yet reached a power-sharing deal with President Pervez Musharraf but will return to Pakistan "very soon". "I will be going back to Pakistan very soon," she said, adding the date of her return will be announced in Pakistan. Musharraf has been negotiating a pact with Bhutto that would see him quit as army chief and Bhutto return to become prime minister.
