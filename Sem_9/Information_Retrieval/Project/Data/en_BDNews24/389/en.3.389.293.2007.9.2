 Dhaka, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com) -- Acting foreign secretary Md Touhid Hossain Sunday said he was not aware of the Indian allegation of the involvement of militant organisation Harkat-ul-Jihad in any bomb blast in Hyderabad, India. "I don't know anything about it (the Indian allegation of Harkat-ul-Jihad's involvement). For the first time I heard about it. I have to crosscheck," Touhid told bdnews24.com. Hyderabad's police commissioner Balwinder Singh told Reuters: "We have registered a case against 15 people...four have been arrested for transporting RDX explosives, from Bangladesh to India, which were used in the Makkah Masjid blasts." The four arrested in connection with the bombing in May of Makkah Mosque in Hyderabad could be part of the same group involved in last week's twin bombings in the same city, Reuters quoted police as saying. "RDX was not used in last week's bombings but there is a possibility that the 15 people we have filed a case against could be part of the same outfit involved in the twin bombings," Singh said. Two blasts occurred minutes apart on Aug 25 in two crowded parts of the city, an emerging information technology hub, killing 40 people and wounding about 80 others. Soon after the incident, Bangladesh condemned the attacks in Hyderabad. On May 18, 11 people were killed when a bomb exploded during Friday prayers at the historic Makkah Mosque in Hyderabad. Indian authorities alleged that Islamist militant groups based in Pakistan and Bangladesh are behind the attacks. Both Islamabad and Dhaka have rejected the idea, saying Indian officials are jumping to conclusions. Singh alleged that the main suspect was Shahid Bilal of Harkat-ul Jihad Islami, a Bangladeshi group. bdnews
