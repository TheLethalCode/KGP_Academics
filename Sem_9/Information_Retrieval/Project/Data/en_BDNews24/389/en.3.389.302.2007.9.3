Security had also been beefed up at the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban premises before Khaleda Zia was brought to the special jail. Additional members of RAB, police and riot police have been deployed there. Deputy Inspector General (prisons) major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told reporters outside the special jail at the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban premises: "Khaleda Zia will get all the facilities due to a first class detainee. She will be allowed to watch TV and read books and newspapers. A chair and table has been provided in her room for reading."

The two buildings are situated about 60 to 70 yards apart."
