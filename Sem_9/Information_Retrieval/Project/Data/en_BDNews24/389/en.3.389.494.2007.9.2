<TITLE> Ericsson eyes higher China margin in 2007 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Jerker Hellstrom STOCKHOLM, Sept 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Telecoms equipment maker Ericsson is aiming to improve margins in China this year and expects to take GSM mobile networks market share from foreign rivals in the Asian nation, the company's China chief said Friday. "China is neutral for the group in regard to margins. There is of course fierce price pressure in China, but there are also huge benefits of scale," Mats Olsson, head of operations for Ericsson's biggest market, told Reuters in an interview. "Our ambition is to marginally improve the margin this year from the previous year," he said. Ericsson's overall group operating margin in 2006 contracted to 20 percent from 21.8 percent in 2005. China accounted for 8 percent of group net sales of a total 89.8 billion Swedish crowns ($13 billion) in the second quarter. "Subscriber and traffic growth for our main business in China -- to sell GSM systems -- is higher than ever," Olsson said. "In the first seven months of this year, China has added an average 6.7 million subscribers per month." Ericsson shares were trading 2.81 percent higher at $37.35 on Nasdaq as of 1748 GMT after closing 1.59 percent higher at 25.60 crowns in Stockholm. MARKET SHARE The company will also increase its market share in China at the expense of its foreign rivals, including Nokia Siemens Networks and Alcatel-Lucent, the 52-year-old executive predicted. "We expect to have a market share this year that is at the same level or marginally higher than the previous year for GSM," Olsson said. "We are the only foreign supplier that will keep or marginally increase its market share." Olsson cited the company's latest public disclosure on market share, which said Ericsson had 35 percent of the GSM market in the nation of 1.3 billion people. Products and services for GSM account for more than 80 percent of Ericsson's business in China, Olsson said. GSM is the dominant second-generation mobile phone standard for most of the world. The other is CDMA. Ericsson also competes for GSM contracts in China with fast-growing homegrown telecoms gear makers Huawei Technologies and ZTE. The Stockholm-based company is equally keen to break into the 3G market in China, although the timing is uncertain. China Mobile, the world's largest wireless operator, expects to launch a trial network of the home grown third-generation TD-SCDMA standard by end-October. Ericsson, which is cooperating with ZTE Corp in the TD-SCDMA trial, has not seen any signals from authorities about the timing of the wider launch of 3G, but has said it expects Beijing to offer 3G licences in the first half of 2008. "I don't think one should count on 3G licences in the near term," Olsson said. "It is not 100 percent certain that they will come even next year, but they will be released by the middle of next year at the earliest."
