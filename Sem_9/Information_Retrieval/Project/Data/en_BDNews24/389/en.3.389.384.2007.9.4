 MUMBAI, Sept 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fast bowler Shanthakumaran Sreesanth hopes his performance at this month's Twenty20 World Cup will earn him a call back to the Indian one-day team for the home series against Australia and Pakistan. The 24-year-old was dropped for the ODI series against England after a patchy performance in the tests, where he proved expensive and struggled for accuracy. "I'm hoping to have good games in South Africa. I've been working on my bowling," Sreesanth told Reuters on Tuesday. "I haven't done greatly in one-dayers but I'll try and come back hard. Hopefully I'll do well in the Twenty20 and get back into the one-day team." Sreesanth is aiming to make an impact in South Africa, where the Twenty20 tournament begins next Tuesday, with his slower ball. "I've basically been working on my slower ball. Twenty20 is about four overs per bowler and if I get my slower balls in the right areas, you end up getting a lot of wickets." The inaugural Twenty20 event will run from Sept. 11-24. Sreesanth took nine wickets in three tests in what was India's first series victory in England in 21 years, but also made news by bowling a beamer at Kevin Pietersen and barging his way past England captain Michael Vaughan for which he was fined. "I'm hoping to stay relaxed (in South Africa) because things happen quickly in Twenty20 and as a bowler one has to think and try it at the right time for results," said Sreesanth, who is expected to lead the attack with Rudra Pratap Singh in the absence of Zaheer Khan, who has been rested. Australia travel to India later this month for a seven-match ODI series and Pakistan begin their tour in Novembe
