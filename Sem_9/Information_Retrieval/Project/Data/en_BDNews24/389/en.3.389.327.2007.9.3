 AL ASAD AIR FORCE BASE, Iraq, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President George W Bush made a surprise visit to Iraq on Monday, just a week before his top officials in Baghdad present pivotal testimony to Congress that could influence future policy on the war. The White House said Bush had arrived at the al-Asad Air Force base, west of Baghdad in Anbar province.

Earlier, British troops quit the Iraqi city of Basra on Monday, leaving the southern oil hub without British forces for the first time since the US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003.
