 Dhaka, Sep 5 (bdnews24.com)  A special court dealing with high-profile corruption cases Wednesday convicted the son of former BNP minister Shajahan Siraj of tax fraud and jailed him for 32 years together in four cases. Judge Shamsunnahar Begum handed down the prison sentence in absence of Rajib Siraj Apu who has been a fugitive from law. The court slapped Tk 24 lakh in fine on Apu who faces another four years in prison should he not pay the sum. The judge said Rajib was to serve out the term simultaneously, meaning he will spend eight years in jail, the highest term which a convict has to face in such cases. Earlier, Rajib and his father were sentenced to the highest eight years in jail in another tax fraud case. The sentence will be in force from the day the convict is arrested. In one of the cases, Rajib got five years in jail Wednesday for concealing amount of wealth in his income tax returns. The court also fined him Tk 3 lakh in the same case. He has to pass another six months if he fails to pay the amount, the judge said. In a second case filed for giving false information on wealth, the court jailed him for three years and fined him Tk 3 lakh. In another verdict on three cases Apu got a total of 24 years in jail. The court fined him Tk 18 lakh and said he would have to stay in jail for three more years in case he failed to pay. On July 16, the National Board of Revenue filed 11 cases against Shahjahan Siraj, wife Rabeya Siraj and son Rajib, accusing them of evading tax and suppressing information on their wealth. NBR deputy tax commissioner Abul Kalam Azad filed five cases against Rajib. Of the cases, the court gave verdict on four cases. According to case details, Rajib, the director of Precast Concrete Industries Ltd, dodged Tk 4.32 lakh in tax year 2004-05, Tk 5.15 lakh in 2005-06, Tk 12 lakh in 2002-03 and Tk 4.80 lakh in 2006-07. On August 8, charges in the case were framed after it was transferred to the Special Judge's Court. The deposition started on August 9 and ended on August 22. On August 28, the judge set the verdict date after closing the hearing. Earlier, Rabeya got 40 years in jail in five cases for tax fraud and concealing wealth information. The court had earlier sentenced Shahjahan and Apu to eight years in jail in two other cases. On August 15, Farzana Khan, daughter-in-law of Shahjahan, was handed down six years in prison. All of them have been escaping arrest. bdnews24.co
