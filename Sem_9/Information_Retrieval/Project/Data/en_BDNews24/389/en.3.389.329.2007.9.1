 RADOM, Poland, Sept 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two pilots were killed performing aerial acrobatics at an air show in Poland on Saturday when their aircraft collided head-on in front of thousands of spectators. A Reuters photographer at the scene said the collision occurred after a three-plane formation fanned out and two of the aircraft slammed into each other as they attempted to re-converge. The stricken planes plummeted towards a wooded area at the edge of the airfield near the south-central town of Radom. Pilots from 15 different countries were taking part in the air show which was cancelled after the crash.
