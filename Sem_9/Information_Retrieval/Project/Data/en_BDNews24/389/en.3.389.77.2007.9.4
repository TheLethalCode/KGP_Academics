 Dhaka, Sept 4 (bdnews24.com) -- A Dhaka court Tuesday ordered Dhaka University professors Anwar Hossain and Harun-or-Rashid into jail after eight days' remand in two phases. They were produced before the Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court at 4pm Tuesday. The investigating officer of the case did not seek further remand for them and appealed to court to send them to jail. Metropolitan magistrate Md Hasan Sarwar did not consider bail petitions for them, as the case was under emergency powers rules. A separate appeal was made for proper medical treatment and division for the teachers in jail. The magistrate ordered the jail authorities to take steps in line with the jail code. Their lawyer Advocate Syed Rezaur Rahman in the hearing on the appeal for treatment and jail division said both teachers were suffering from diabetes and high-blood pressure. After a 20-minute hearing, the magistrate read out his order. When the lawyers wanted to know whether there was any appeal for showing the accused persons arrested in any other case, the magistrate said he does not know anything about it. On the same issue, court inspector MA Haque said he did not know anything about it. In the remand return report, it was said that important information was extracted from the two teachers, which has been kept secret for the interest of the investigation. Later, with the court's permission, lawyers Syed Rezaur Rahman, Shahara Khatun, Abul Kalam Azad, Ferozur Rahman Montu, Abdullah Abu, Ruhul Quddus Babu and the teachers' wives Ayesha Anwar and Nargis Akter spoke to the accused on the case in the courtroom. The two teachers were arrested at their homes on the Dhaka University campus on Aug 23. bdnew
