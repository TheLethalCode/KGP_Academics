 RABAT, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Morocco's Islamist opposition, tipped to do well in parliamentary polls on Friday, would double a levy on stock market deals and tax some consumer goods to fund anti-poverty campaigns if it came to power, its officials say. The likelihood of the Justice and Development Party's (PJD) being able to impose such policies is small, since reform-minded King Mohammed, the north African country's top decision-maker, is unlikely to ask it to lead a government, analysts said. But if, as some expect, the party becomes the largest single group in parliament it would have the clout to lobby loudly for its ideas, honed by years of campaigning against the failings of a liberal elite seen by many as corrupt and ineffective. "The main problem of Morocco's economy is the gap between rich and poor," said Mohamed Nejib Boulif, a PJD parliament member and economist who played a key role in drafting the group's election programme. "Our programme aims at plugging that gap ... and expanding the middle class to increase domestic demand as part of economic levers to achieve 7 percent growth," he told Reuters. That annual growth goal would be an average over 2008-2012, he said, up from 5 percent in the previous five years. PJD also plans specific taxes in the name of social solidarity and wealth distribution, hoping to undermine support for socialists who it says have failed to narrow a glaring wealth gap during almost 10 years in power. Income tax for the lower middle class would be trimmed by between 2.0 and 5.0 percentage points from between 15 percent and 42 percent now and those earning 3,000 Moroccan Dirhams ($383) or less per month would be freed from paying income tax. But the PJD also proposes an Islamic charity tax known as Zakat of 2.5 percent per year and says taxable assets worth 300 billion dirhams could be targeted under the scheme. It foresees so-called solidarity taxes for some consumer goods, also to finance anti-poverty schemes. Pious Moroccan Muslims already pay Zakat tax voluntarily to the poor but the PJD wants to set up a fund to collect Zakat money and spend it on anti-poverty projects. "Giving the Zakat money to poor people you meet at mosque doors or elsewhere would not be effective to cut poverty. That is why we propose the fund to spend the money more efficiently," Boulif said. Boulif also gave the example of tap water, saying that biggest consumers, often rich people, would pay 100 dirhams on top of their 1,000-dirham monthly water bills. "This 100 dirhams will go to finance drilling for water and building roads for poor rural areas," he said. A tax on stock market transactions would rise to 20 percent from 10 percent, boosting government income by 1.5 billion dirhams by 2012 to spend on poverty reduction and public works. Moroccan markets have not taken fright at the PJD's ideas, in part because business people know that the electoral system makes it hard for any one party to win an outright majority and force through a programme without consultation. "I don't think they'll be able to come and add another tax," said a senior market trader in Casablanca. "We expect them to have 25-30 percent of Parliament, but we don't see them getting 51 percent." The exchange's benchmark index has risen 41 percent this year on optimism for the economy and falling bond yields. But the prospect of a heftier stock trade tax dismays some. "This would put a sudden brake on bourse activity," said Abdelmounaim Dilami, director of daily newspaper L'Economiste. On Morocco's vital tourism sector, the PJD has pronounced itself a firm supporter of plans for a big increase in visitors and says it will not ban alcohol or bikinis. It will, however, seek to persuade Moroccans to live a more pious li
