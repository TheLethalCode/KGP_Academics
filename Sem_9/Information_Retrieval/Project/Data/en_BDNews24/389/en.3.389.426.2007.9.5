 LONDON, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com/lqReuters) - Britain's service sector unexpectedly acclerated in August and house price inflation picked up, surveys showed on Wednesday, in a sign five interest rate hikes have failed to take the steam out of the UK economy. But the Bank of England is still expected to keep interest rates on hold this week as turbulence in global financial markets has already sent the cost of money rocketing. All 61 analysts polled by Reuters expect the central bank to keep borrrowing costs at 5.75 percent when their monthly meeting ends at 1100 GMT on Thursday, but a sizeable minority still think it will raise rates to 6 percent before the year's end. Wednesday's data seemed to reinforce the minority view, although the market reaction was muted as investors focused instead on continuing gyrations in money markets where three-month interbank rates hit an 8-1/2 year high. The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply/NTC service sector activity index rose to 57.6 last month from 57.0 in July. Analysts had forecast a pullback to 56.5. Separately, HBOS Plc said its Halifax house price index rose 0.4 percent in August, taking the annual 3-month rate of house price inflation up to 11.4 percent from 11.2 percent. "Plenty here to suggest that the Monetary Policy Committee might yet have to hike again to cool demand and contain price pressures," said Vicky Redwood of Capital Economics. Other recent data have also rekindled talk that borrowing costs may need to rise again. A CIPS survey earlier this week showed manufacturing activity grew at its fastest pace in 3 years, despite higher rates and the strong pound, while other recent housing data have also pointed to resilience in the property market. But some analysts noted as lending rates on the short-term money market are already more than one percentage point above the BoE's benchmark rate, there was little urgency for policymakers to act. "The financial market turbulence will result in a tightening of credit conditions just sufficient to negate the need for a rise to 6 percent," said Simon Hayes of Barclays Capital. The central bank on Wednesday finally broke its silence on the liquidity squeeze that has gripped markets in the last month, announcing an increase in banks' reserves target for the coming month in a step to bring overnight interest rates down. Commercial banks' reserves target for the month ahead will be 6 percent higher at 17.630 billion pounds -- giving them greater scope to borrow at the BoE's main lending rate. Moreover, the BoE will allow them to raise their reserve targets by a further 25 percent next week, a total of some 4.4 billion pounds, without being penalised. Analysts it would take some time for calm to return to the market despite the BoE's measures. It was therefore still too early to conclude that official rates could rise again. "It would seem unlikely the MPC would raise rates given the current degree of financial market turbulence," said Philip Shaw, economist at Investec. "But there is still a degree of robustness in the economy and some upside risks remain to interest rate prospect
