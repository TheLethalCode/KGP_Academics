 Dhaka, Sept 4 (bdnews24.com)  Allrounder Mashrafee Bin Mortaza spared Bangladesh's blues Tuesday with some blistering strokeplays to power his side to a slim 21-run win over ICC associate member Uganda in the Twenty20 quadrangular tournament. Bangladesh stymied Uganda to 124 for nine in 20 overs after scoring 145 for five in the Gymkhana Club Ground in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi. Vice-captain Mashrafee, batting at number six, remained unbeaten on 40 off just 20 balls and later accounted for two middle-order batsmen to halt the Ugandan march for an upset. Skipper Mohammad Ashraful chose to bat first for the first time in the tournament after winning the toss. His openers backed up the decision with Pakistan match's star Nazimuddin sending the first ball he faced to the point boundary. Tamim Iqbal had a lucky escape from an inside edge off Kenneth Kamyuka and followed that up with two identical drives through mid-off for four. However, both openers perished in quick succession with first-change Ugandan bowler Emmanuel Isaneez removing Nazimuddin (16 off 13 balls) in his fourth delivery. He then trapped Tamim (27 off 21) lbw to reduce Bangladesh to 44 for two in 6.1 overs. Bangladesh attempted to accelerate the run-rate, but Ashraful was run out for 13 off 23 balls and Aftab Ahmed caught by Kamyuka off Olwenyi for a 22-ball 23, with the side reeling at 91 for four in 14.2 overs. Mashrafee paired with Alok Kapali (12 off 14 balls), who returned shortly, caught by Sematimba off Olwenyi, and the vice-captain took charge to take his side to a modest total. Mashrafee pulled a short ball by Olwenyi over deep-midwicket before hitting a four and six off Kamyuka as Bangladesh creamed 29 runs in the last two overs. Pacer Syed Rasel dismissed Ugandan opener Roger Mukasa (6) in the first over and one-down Lawrence Sematimba (4) in his second to reduce the east African nation to 12 for two in 2.5 overs. Farhad Reza ran opener Arthur Kyobe (5) out to leave the Ugandans 31 for three in 5.4 overs. However, skipper Joel Olwenyi brought life to the game with an attacking 36-ball 46, featuring three fours and two sixes. The Ugandans were in the hunt for an upset until Ashraful had Olwenyi caught by Nadif Chowdhury to reduce them to 96 for five in 14.2 overs. Mashrafee then took two quick wickets in one over to bring Bangladesh back in the match. Spinner Abdur Razzak removed another two batsmen in the last over to kill the Uganda's chances. Brief score: Bangladesh145/5 in 20 overs (Tamim 27, Nazimuddin 16, Aftab 23, Ashraful 13, Alok 12, Mashrafee 40 not out, Nadif 8 not out, Isaneez 2/21 and Olwenyi 2/29). Uganda124/9 in 20 overs (Mukasa 6, Kyobe 5, Sematimba 4, Olwenyi 46, Nandi Patel 21, Kamyuka 15, Ondeko 19 not out, Kibukamusoke 0, Isaneez 0, Arinaitwe 0, Rasel 2/19, Razzak 2/19, Ashraful 2/27 and Mashrafee 2/29). bd
