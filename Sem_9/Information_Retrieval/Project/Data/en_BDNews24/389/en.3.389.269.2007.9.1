 Dhaka, Sept 1 (bdnews24.com)The garment industry will face stiff competition when the bar on exports of Chinese readymade garments to the US and European markets goes after 2008, business leaders and bankers said Saturday. There is no alternative to diversification of exports and create new markets to cope with the competition, they told a daylong workshop on "Incoterms 2000: Interpretation and Correct Selection of Delivery Terms" at Bangladesh China Friendship Conference Centre. Mahbubur Rahman, president of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Bangladesh, said: "It's feared that China will export garments at comparatively low prices like other commodities. For that they have already taken massive preparations." "In that case, US and European importers will buy cheaper garments. So our exporters should increase the list of exportable commodities and look for new markets," he said. For Bangladesh, 75 percent of export earnings come from readymade garments, with most exports going to the US and European markets. When the bar on the exports of Chinese garments to the two big markets goes, the readymade garment industry of Bangladesh will face a serious challenge, Rahman said. "Exporters have to export garments to those two markets competing with China. Whether Bangladesh can survive it is of serious concern," he said. "Foreign direct investment in the country has decreased. A good number of investment proposals have long been hanging in the balance. The government or the Board of Investment should take quick decisions about good investment proposals," Rahman said Anwar-ul-Alam Chowdhury, president of Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said: "The terms of trade are quickly changing on the international market. The government, different trade bodies, banks and all concerned should come forward to assist the exports in keeping pace with the change." Mamun Rashid, managing director of Citibank NA, Bangladesh, said: "If the terms of international trade in imports and exports are properly used, the cost of business will come down and waste of time be prevented." A total of 161 people involved in readymade garment exports joined the workshop, organised by ICC in cooperation with GTZ, a German agency for technical cooperation. International trade consultant Pavel Andrle also spoke. bdnews
