 LONDON, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's top share index fell 1.7 percent and broke a five-day winning streak as tightness in money markets underlined fears of a worsening credit squeeze and weak US data raised concerns over the health of the economy. The FTSE 100 closed down 106.1 points, or 1.66 percent at 6,270.7, only the second down day since Aug. 17 when the U.S. Federal Reserve cut its discount rate to calm jumpy investors. European shares also finished lower on Wednesday. Data showed an index of US pending home sales hit its lowest level in six years in July and US private employers likely added fewer jobs in August than analysts had expected. They raised further concerns about the outlook of the US economy against the backdrop of a crisis in the risky subprime mortgage sector. "We are going to go through a long erratic period. There is absolutely no certainty that this crisis is anywhere near over," said Howard Wheeldon, senior strategist at BGC Partners. "Until the markets have confidence that the credit markets can return to some form of normalcy, the amount of business that can be done is going to be extremely limited," he said, adding that a US interest rate cut would alleviate the problem. US short-term interest rate futures rose strongly to suggest aggressive Fed action on rates this month after weak employment and housing data suggested economic growth could be slowing. Mortgage lenders were among the top losers on the FTSE 100 on concerns of their funding costs as money markets in Europe remained tight, and three-month sterling rates rose for a sixth straight day to a new 8-1/2 year peak. Northern Rock shed 5.3 percent and Bradford & Bingley fell 5.6 percent. They also struggled from rating downgrades by Lehman Brothers. Alliance & Leicester dropped 4.4 percent after going ex-dividend and after Lehman cut its price target on the stock. Banks accounted for 26 percent of the index's fall, with Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays, HBOS, HSBC, Standard Chartered and Lloyds TSB all down. Investors will keep a keen watch on the Fed's Beige book for anecdotal evidence of current economic conditions in each of the central bank's 12 districts after the European market close. They are also bracing for the interest rate decisions by the Bank of England and the European Central Bank on Thursday. FINANCIALS, COMMODITIES ALSO DRAG Hedge fund group Man Group slipped 3.7 percent and fund manager INVESCO dipped 2.8 percent. Insurers also suffered, with Prudential down 2 percent. Commodity shares were among the standout losers, with index heavyweight Royal Dutch Shell down 1.3 percent and rival BP easing 0.4 percent. In the mining sector, Anglo American, BHP Billiton, Xstrata and Kazakhmys all fell. But Vedanta Resources rose 3.1 percent, one of the three gainers on the index, after traders said Merrill Lynch had added the stock to its "Europe 1" list, while Lonmin gained 0.4 percent.
