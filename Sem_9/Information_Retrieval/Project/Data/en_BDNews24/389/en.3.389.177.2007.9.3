 BANGKOK, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian Cup champions Iraq are considering Norwegian Egil Olsen as national team coach but have not given up hope former boss Jorvan Vieira will return to the post, the country's soccer chief said on Monday. Iraqi Football Federation President Hussein Saeed told Reuters that former Norway coach Olsen previously turned down the job but had recently expressed interest in leading Iraq to the 2010 World Cup finals. However, Hussein said he was hopeful that Brazilian Vieira, who quit after steering the unfancied Iraqis to a fairytale Asian Cup victory in July, would reconsider his decision to quit. "Right now, we have made no decision," he said by telephone from Amman. "Mr Olsen has said he is interested in the position but we intend to speak to Jorvan Vieira again also." Vieira has been linked with a number of national and club positions but has yet to find a job since he quit Iraq, complaining of chronic disorganisation in the war-ravaged country's soccer federation. Despite pleas to reconsider from fans and even Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, the 54-year-old has repeatedly ruled out a return. Olsen led Norway to the World Cup finals in 1994 and 1998, taking them to number two in the FIFA rankings at one point. The 65-year-old had an unsuccessful stint in England as boss of Wimbledon in 1999 but was sacked before the club were relegated. Vieira has coached 26 clubs and five national teams and was assistant coach of Morocco when they finished top of their group ahead of England, Portugal and Poland in the 1986 World Cup. Iraq are keen to have a new coach installed ahead of their opening World Cup qualifier, away to Pakistan on Oct 8
