 Dhaka, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com) - The DGEN or general index on the Dhaka Stock Exchange crossed the 2500-point mark for the first time on Sunday, triggered by a rally in the shares of banks. An amendment to the Banking Companies Act 1991 approved by the government last week, which allowed banks to raise capital requirements up to Tk 2 billion from Tk 1 billion, continues to shore up bank stocks. Banks with low capital bases moved up the most with prices of some banks touching a new level. BRAC Bank, City Bank and AB Bank led the rally. "If the index is sustained at this point during the current week, it will be the new support base. And in that case, the market will fluctuate over the 2500 point-mark," said Yawer Sayeed, chief of AIMS of Bangladesh that manages about Tk 750 million in funds. IT stocks also moved up on reports that Internet protocol (IP) telephony licences are being reserved for solely for ISPs in the approved International Long Distance Telecommunication Service (ILDTS) policy for 2007 Power, pharmaceuticals and cement stocks fell. Mutual funds closed mixed. The DGEN or general index ended at 2516.72, up 61 points or 2.51 percent. The DSI or all-share price index rallied 52.16 points or 2.523 percent to 2111.87.
