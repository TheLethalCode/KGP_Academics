 Dhaka, Sept 04 (bdnews24.com)The foreign ministry Tuesday rubbished Indian media reports that have linked some Bangladeshi citizens from an extremist Islamic organisation to the recent twin bomb blasts in Hyderabad. "Such reports are disturbing and clearly motivated," the ministry said in a statement. The statement alleged that Indian media outlets were trying to portray Bangladesh as a "hotbed of terrorism" through news reports in the print and electronic media. The statement said: "Bangladesh abhors terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and is committed to cooperation with the international community in the global fight against terrorism." "Bangladesh urges the Indian media to refrain from such sensationalism as this is neither helpful in the fight against terrorism nor in fostering better relations between the two close and friendly neighbours," it said. Some Indian media reports have alleged that the illegal Islamic organisaton, Harkat-ul-Jihad al Islam, which is based in Bangladeshi, was involved in the Hyderabad bomb blasts on Aug 24. Some newspapers also reported that the type of explosive used in the blast came from Bangladesh. Further reports circulated in India claimed the Bangladesh police had arrested one Abu Hamza in connection with the bombing, which claimed over 40 lives. Local police have denied arresting anyone named Abu Hamza in connection with the incident. bdn
