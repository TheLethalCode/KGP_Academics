 LONDON, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India, put in to bat, hammered England for 324-6 in a rain-interrupted 50 overs in the fifth one-day international at Headingley in Leeds on Sunday. England, without the injured Andrew Flintoff, restricted the Indians to seven runs in the first five overs but then the floodgates opened. Sourav Ganguly (59) and Sachin Tendulkar (71) put on 116 in 118 balls for the opening partnership and Yuvraj Singh made 72 off 58 balls before being caught on the long-on boundary. Gautam Gambhir weighed in with 51. Rain forced the teams off with the score on 286-4 with three overs left and India made the most of them on their return, hitting another 38. Stuart Broad, man of the match after a fine all-round performance in the fourth one-dayer which England won by three-wickets, fared less well on Sunday, ending with figures of one for 84 from 10 overs. England lead the seven-match series 3-1
