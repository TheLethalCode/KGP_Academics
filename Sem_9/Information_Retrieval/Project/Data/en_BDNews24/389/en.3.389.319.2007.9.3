<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com)A Chittagong court ordered the six-year imprisonment of local BNP leader and former deputy mayor Dastagir Chowdhury Monday, on charges of extortion and looting. Dastagir was a former general secretary of BNP for the Chittagong city unit. Metropolitan session judge La Mong also issued the same prison term to Dastagir's aid Md Shahjahan. The court's verdict was based on a case filed by auto-parts trader Jalal Miah ,who alleged that a group of unscrupulous people led by Dastagir tried to extort Tk 20,000 from him on December 5, 2006. They also vandalised and looted the shop when Jalal refused to pay the money, according to the case record. "We expected justice. We will appeal to the higher court after this verdict," said Dastagir's lawyer Rana Dashgupta. The lawyer claimed that it was not possible that a leader of one of the main political parties and a former deputy mayor would possibly attack a shop for only Tk 20,000. Security forces arrested Dastagir on January 16. The case was filed on February 19. bdnews24
