 PARIS, Sept 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Suez and Gaz de France resumed talks on Saturday to try to reach a deal on a delayed 90-billion-euro ($122.9 billion) merger, with an announcement possible on Monday. Suez has, according to sources close to the situation, bowed to pressure from French President Nicolas Sarkozy to split its business and shed part of its historic water assets to salvage a merger agreement. The sale of Suez's environment unit, which is valued at nearly 20 billion euros, has been dragged into talks with the French state and would solve a financial impasse that has threatened the deal. The merger was drawn up as one of equals but since the plan first saw the light of day, at the start of 2006, Suez's market capitalisation has risen faster than that of GDF. Analysts have said that for the deal to remain a merger of equals, Suez must slim down by shedding assets and distribute the receipts of such sales to its shareholders through a special dividend. French radio reported that a joint board meeting could be held on Sunday afternoon and the firms will announce themselves whether or not they will merge on Monday, according to AFP newswire which cited an aide to Sarkozy. GDF and Sarkozy's office both declined to comment and could not confirm the remarks made by the aide. Suez was not immediately available for comment.
