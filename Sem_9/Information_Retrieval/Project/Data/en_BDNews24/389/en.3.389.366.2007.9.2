 BEIJING, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China said on Sunday its military would participate in UN programmes on spending and conventional weapons inventories, a bid to address international concern about the rapid build-up of its opaque armed services. "These are two important decisions of the Chinese government in the field of military transparency," spokeswoman Jiang Yu said in a statement on the Foreign Ministry Web site, fmprc.gov.cn. China this year would begin submitting basic data on military expenditures from the latest year to the United Nations, and resume submitting yearly import and export information on seven categories of conventional weapons, Jiang said. China had dropped out of the UN register of conventional arms after a "certain country" in 1996 contradicted the spirit of UN resolutions on the issue through its weapons sales to Taiwan, the statement said. It did not specify the country. The push for transparency comes amid international concern about China's military spending, which has seen double-digit growth nearly every year since the 1990s. In March China boosted its military budget by 17.8 percent to about $45 billion in 2007. A Pentagon report in May estimated spending could be two to three times that figure and said China's rapid military expansion appeared to be partly aimed at increasing its ability to handle regional crises, such as conflicts over resources or territory. Washington has said Beijing is trying to project its growing military might, while Beijing maintains its armed forces are geared for self-defence. Other countries have raised concerns as well. Australia said in a defence paper in July that China's rapid expansion risked creating misunderstandings and instability in the region. And on Friday Japan's Defence Minister Masahiko Komura said he would continue to press China for details on its military spending, despite agreement with his visiting Chinese counterpart Cao Gangchuan to allow a Chinese warship to visit Japan for the first time and try to set up a crisis hotline. China has made other efforts to increase military transparency, inviting Western military observers to exercises, increasing exchanges between high level personnel, and, in July, even inviting foreign journalists to a camp to observe drills. In August, U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Mike Mullen said he was reassured and encouraged after meetings with top Chinese military officials in Beijing but uncertainty over China's long- term objectives remained. Jiang said on Sunday that joining the UN programmes demonstrated that "China pursues the new security concept featuring mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality and cooperation..." "China is willing to make joint efforts with the international community in promoting international peace and security," she sa
