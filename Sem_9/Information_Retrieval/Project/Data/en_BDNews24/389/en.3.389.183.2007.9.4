 STOCKHOLM, Sep 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Film stars, top politicians and members of Sweden's royal family were among those who celebrated the life and work of directing legend Ingmar Bergman on Monday in a ceremony at Stockholm's Royal Dramatic Theatre. Bergman died in his sleep on July 30 at age 89. Considered by some to be the greatest film maker ever, he produced 54 movies, 126 theatre productions and 39 radio plays during a career spanning 60 years. Sweden's most famous son influenced a generation of directors and artists with often somber works that dealt with sexual torment and the search for meaning in life.

Earlier on Monday, the Swedish government pledged 20 million Swedish crowns ($3 million) to ensure Bergman's films and scripts are preserved. "The rich output of films and television drama contributed by Ingmar Bergman make up an important part of our cultural heritage," Reinfeldt and Liljeroth wrote in Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter. The ministers said the Swedish master's movies were in high demand from festivals but there were too few copies of certain works and the quality in some cases was poor. The money will also go towards the purchase of copyrights and putting Bergman's scripts in digital form. A vast store of Bergman's scripts, notes, sketches and photographs -- ranked as one of history's great archives by UNESCO -- is managed by the Ingmar Bergman Foundation, but the ministers said the foundation lacks the resources to turn the works into digital fo
