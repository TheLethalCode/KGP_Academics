 Sept 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Clerics picked Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani on Tuesday to lead a powerful Iranian body, the Assembly of Experts, in a boost for the former president who wants better ties with the West and a blow to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Following are some facts about Rafsanjani: RISE AND FALL -- AND RISE AGAIN -- Born in 1934 to a prosperous farmer, he was one of nine children. His name comes from the town of Rafsanjan. -- He left home at 14 to study in Qom under Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who was to become the Islamic Republic's founder. Before the Islamic revolution Rafsanjani was tortured under the Shah and jailed in 1975, charged with links to left-wing groups. -- At the centre of power since the 1979 revolution to topple the U.S.-backed Shah, he had a key role in policy in the 1980-88 war and in covert arms-for-hostages deals with Washington in the 1980s. -- Rafsanjani was president from 1989 to 1997 and has also served as parliamentary speaker and armed forces commander. His lowest ebb was in the 2000 parliamentary election when he scraped in after a controversial recount and then withdrew. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad then beat him in the 2005 presidential race. -- He has become a vocal critic of the president, even if his attacks are often veiled. Marking his comeback, he was top of the vote count in Tehran in the December election to the Assembly of Experts, a body with the power -- never exercised -- to unseat the supreme leader, Iran's top authority. WHO IS RAFSANJANI? -- A pragmatic dealmaker, Rafsanjani has favoured economic liberalisation and detente with the West, while keeping Khomeini's system of clerical rule. -- Hardliners and liberals alike have, in turn, been equally distrustful of him for his flexible political style. He has faced accusations of opportunism, corruption and human rights abuses -- charges he denies. Meanwhile, he has proved skilful in spanning more than one political faction. -- Since former President Mohammad Khatami replaced him in 1997, Rafsanjani has headed the Expediency Council -- a powerful arbitration body between parliament and the constitutional watchdog Guardian Council -- with legislative powers, and influence on policies on the economy and nuclear negotiations with the West. -- His nickname, "Kuseh", which in Persian means both "beardless" and "shark", neatly captures his physical appearance and political acumen.
