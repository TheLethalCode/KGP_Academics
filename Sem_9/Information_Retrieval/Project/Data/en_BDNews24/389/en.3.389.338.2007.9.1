 Dhaka, Sep 1 (bdnews24.com)Security forces in plainclothes assaulted six staff members of Dhaka University's Kabi Jasimuddin Hall Saturday, dormitory staffers alleged. A staff member of the dormitory, not wanting to be named, told bdnews24.com that a group of plainclothes security officials came to Jasimuddin Hall at 12noon. "One of them introduced himself as a 'major'. They asked staff members of the hall for information about four students," he said. The staffer explained that they could not provide the information, despite an hour of questioning, as the names of the students were not their official names. "As a result the law enforcers started behaving roughly with the staff, saying, 'They need some beating'." The victims are administrative officer Abu Taher, supervisor Shah Alam, plumber Rafiq and guards Mujibor Rahman, Yusuf Ali and Abdur Rashid. Hearing of the incident acting provost Nasiruddin Munshi and university security officer Kamrul Ahsan arrived on the scene. Munshi said: "It may be a case of misunderstanding. I have informed the VC and others." Proctor AK Firoz said: "I wasn't present there. The hall provost and security officer went to the spot. I spoke to the head of the security agents by mobile phone. I asked them to contact the provost for information they require." bdnews24.c
