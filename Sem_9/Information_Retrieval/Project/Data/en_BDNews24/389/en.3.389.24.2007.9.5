 WASHINGTON, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An earthquake hit Mexico's Gulf of California on Tuesday, not far from the site of a stronger quake recorded on Saturday, but there were no immediate reports of damage. The magnitude 5 quake hit about 100 miles (163 km) north of the resort of Los Cabos on the tip of Baja California, at a depth of 6.2 miles (10 km), the US Geological Survey reported. It hit at 9:07 pm local time (11:07 EDT /0307 GMT Wednesday), the USGS said on its Web site. No injuries were reported in the wake of Saturday's 6.3 magnitude quake, which was slightly further north. Earthquakes in the Gulf of California, also known as the Sea of Cortez, do not normally generate tsunamis. The gulf separates the sparsely populated Baja California peninsula from mainland Mexico. In April, a strong magnitude 6 earthquake shook Mexico, sending thousands of tourists in the resort city of Acapulco fleeing into the streets in panic and knocking out electricity 250 miles (410 km) away in Mexico City. bd
