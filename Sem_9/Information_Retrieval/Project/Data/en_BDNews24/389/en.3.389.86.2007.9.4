<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com) - The Securities and Exchange Commission Monday withdrew its restriction on the trading of shares of five companies on the normal public market, an official said. "We think the volatility in the prices of these issues has narrowed. We directed the trading of these shares to the spot market following volatile movements in their prices," SEC member Mansur Alam told bdnews24.com. The restriction was placed more than one month ago when the regulator directed the bourses to put the trading of the shares of the five issues on the spot market, where deals take place through cash or pay order instead of cheque. The five companies are: Power Grid Company of Bangladesh, DESCO, Summit Power, BRAC Bank and AB Bank. "These shares are now free of the restriction. They will be traded on the normal public market in their respective categories," Alam said. Shares of all the issues will begin trading again on the normal public market from September 5, said the Securities and Exchange Commission directive Monday. bdnews
