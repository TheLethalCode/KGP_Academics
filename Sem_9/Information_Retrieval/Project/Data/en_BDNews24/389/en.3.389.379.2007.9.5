<TITLE> CA's request to Intel stirs confusion </TITLE>

 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com) -- Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Tuesday created some confusion in the technology world following his request to Intel chief Craig Barrett to "assist Bangladesh to achieve worldwide connectivity through WiMAX". Intel Corporation's chairman met the chief adviser in a whirlwind half-day visit to Bangladesh in his capacity as chairman of the Global Alliance for Information Technologies. The world's biggest chipmaker's chairman has positively responded to the chief adviser's request. But the request seems to be running counter to the government's "anti-broadband policy". Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission had prohibited the internet service providers deploying WiMAX in June. The embargo remains effective until BTRC enacts a "policy" regarding this broadband technology. But it is yet to be announced despite elapsing of 90 days. Once it is born, the caretaker government will make history by enacting the very first technology-depended policy. Even the "corrupt" political governments in the past recognised the fact that policy is always independent of technology. Interestingly, the immediate past four-party alliance government had left the office leaving a nearly final broadband policy. It says broadband is "An 'always on' data/Internet connection that ensures a minimum bandwidth of 128 kbps." The draft broadband policy also recognises WiMAX being "A newer standard of wireless networking designed to provide Metropolitan Area Access, to homes and businesses as the last mile of high speed internet access to the end user." It further says, "WiMAX is designed for building a network infrastructure when the environment or distance is not favourable to a wired network." BTRC may have undisclosed good reasons behind its tirelessly secretive effort to reinvent the wheel of WiMAX policy. Yet the regulator should have shared it with the CA before he solicited the Intel chairman's assistance on this technology. Because, it is politically incorrect to seek foreign assistance on an issue that has been banned by the host government in the first place. The embargo on WiMAX is the biggest regulatory hurdle the country's broadband industry has ever faced. But its logic and sustainability are equally questionable. BTRC seems to be confused with the mobile version of WiMAX that operates in 2.3 GHz and 2.5 GHz bands. But it is yet to issue any frequency in either of these spectrums. BTRC has rather allocated frequency in 3.5 GHz band which runs only the fixed version of WiMAX. Therefore, it should not stall the initiatives to provide wireless broadband using 3.5 GHz solutions. Craig Barrett's company is working to fast come up with standard WiMAX chipsets in all bands for laptops and other portable devices. Once it is done, all laptops will become WiMAX devices, as they are by default Wi-Fi gadget today. Users will exchange data and certainly voice, bypassing the telecoms networks. And all restrictions will become ineffective. Until then Intel's chairman Crag Barrett as well as the WiMAX technology will remain offside in Bangladesh. bdnews
