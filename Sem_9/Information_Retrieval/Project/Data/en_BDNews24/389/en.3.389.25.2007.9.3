 ISLAMABAD, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Pakistani government is expected to resume power-sharing talks with former prime minister Benazir Bhutto but ruling-party opponents have to be won over if a deal is to be struck, a government official said on Monday. President and army chief Pervez Musharraf is expected to seek election for another term some time between Sept. 15 and Oct. 15 but after eight years in power he is facing sliding popularity and mounting legal and political opposition. A pact with Bhutto, who has been in self exile for eight years, would bolster his support and help him overcome constitutional challenges, while helping her skirt corruption charges and return to politics. But Bhutto said on the weekend talks with the government on a package of proposals had stalled after opposition from members of Musharraf's ruling party, who fear being sidelined by a deal that could clear the way for Bhutto's return to power. "We expect that the dialogue will resume soon," said Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azim Khan. But he and a spokesmen for Musharraf said they had no information about a specific meeting. bdnews24.com/lq/1817hrs With Musharraf's term as president and army chief coming to an end, and his opponents vowing to end his rule, Pakistan -- a nuclear-armed U.S. ally on the front line of the West's fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban -- faces months of uncertainty. A spokesman for two-time prime minister Bhutto said she was travelling from London to Dubai on Monday. She has lived in both places over the past eight years. But the spokesman said he had no information about any talks. DEMANDS Bhutto has insisted that Musharraf step down as army chief. She also wants immunity from prosecution for herself and others who served in the late 1980s and 1990s. She is also demanding the lifting of a ban on a prime minister serving a third term, and that the president be stripped of the power to dismiss governments. In return, Musharraf would get the support of Bhutto's party for a constitutional amendment clearing the way for him to continue as a civilian president. But fierce opposition to the deal from Musharraf's ruling Pakistan Muslim League (PML), as well as from some members of Bhutto's party, could scupper it. "It's going to be harder day by day because of hardliners from both sides," Railways Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed told Dawn Television. Deputy Information Minister Khan said the ruling party -- Musharraf's power base -- had to sign off on any pact: "Perhaps the ground realities have dawned on people that matters are not as simple as they seem. "A simple understanding with the People's Party will not do, that will not be sufficient," he said, referring to Bhutto's party. "That is something that has been overlooked." Information Minister Mohammad Ali Durrani said on Sunday some of Bhutto's demands were "undemocratic". Khan said the corruption cases Bhutto faces were a major sticking point. "It's all very nice to talk about democracy and sending the army back to the barracks but there are other issues such as her corruption cases," he said. Bhutto has said she will announce plans to return home on Sept. 14 -- with or without a deal. Another former exiled prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, is vowing to return on Sept. 10 to launch a campaign to unseat Musharraf. Lawyers, outraged when Musharraf tried to sack the chief justice in March, are due to begin an agitation campaign against him on Sept. 6 while several cases against the president's bid for another term have been lodged in the Supreme Court. The government is sounding out Islamist parties for their support but they appear lukewarm after Musharraf broke a promise to them to step
