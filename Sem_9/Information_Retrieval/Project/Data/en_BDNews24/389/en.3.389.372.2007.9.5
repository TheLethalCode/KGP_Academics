 DOUAR ESCUELA, Morocco, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Qadi Youssef turns his radio down to make himself heard above the sermon being beamed into his shop in this fly-infested Moroccan slum. Hopelessness has the Casablanca shanty of Douar Escuela in its grip, the bearded grocer said, and Friday's parliamentary election will do nothing to bring the jobs it desperately needs. "The people have totally lost confidence because it is the same scenario in every election," said Youssef, accusing politicians of not keeping fine-sounding promises. Things have worsened since suicide bombings in March by young men from Douar Escuela, the same slum that was home to some of the Islamist militants who attacked Casablanca in 2003. "Unemployment is everywhere, especially after the explosions," he said. "People refuse to employ the young people of the district. They accuse everyone of being a terrorist. Anyone who has a beard gets called fanatic and backward." Such opinions are widespread in Douar Escuela, a warren of hut-sized concrete homes topped by corrugated iron roofs baking in the summer sun. Children play barefoot amid mounds of foul-smelling garbage and festering open sewers. Many in this slum, part of the impoverished Sidi Moumen neighbourhood of the five million-strong city of Casablanca, fear the polls will be an exercise in futility. Melodia Sade, 54, a divorced mother of four daughters, said she cannot stand listening to politicians' promises. "I'm living from hand to mouth. We only see pretty promises at election time," she said. "I don't see hope in the future. In summer we live in heat and in winter there is the problem of leaks, and the rats." Such comments can be heard across Morocco. Douar Escuela's unhappy distinction, according to resident El Haj Mohammed, 66, is that its link to the suicide bombers means it suffers the stigma of being seen as a breeding ground for terrorists. "We have lost confidence and our sons have lost confidence, because they are unemployed," said Mohammed, walking slowly with the aid of a stick. "No one wants to employ them. They are accused of being terrorists." At the root of the malaise, commentators say, is a belief that parliament is a toothless institution made up of politicians who fail to keep promises they make to get elected. "I've lost my faith in elections," said Khaled Drdak, 32, unemployed with a wife and two children who rely on his meagre income from hiring out his donkey and cart at a nearby market. "I don't even have a home of my own to sleep in." Some of the shacks have been destroyed under government plans to eradicate slum housing but most remain, bereft of running water or proper drains. Some residents say their situation got even worse during the election campaign. Queues at a standpipe have lengthened because the flow of water has slowed to a trickle. "We spend six hours here filling our jugs. They do this on purpose to pressure us to vote and in exchange someone will come and correct the problem," said Bouchra Messbah, 19, who works in a shoe factory. Comments from the people of Douar Escuela suggest few Moroccan slum dwellers will turn out to vote on Friday but activists say many will, if only in exchange for a few dirhams handed out by corrupt election agents. "People live in deep poverty and do not think the elections will change their lives for the better -- this is enough to tempt them to take money," said Azdin Akesbi, general secretary of anti-corruption association Transparency Mar
