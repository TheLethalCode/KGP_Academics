 Dhaka, Sep 5 (bdnews24.com) -- A Dhaka court Wednesday sent former BNP lawmaker Fazlul Haque Milon to jail on multiple charges of involvement in criminal activities and embezzling relief. The chief metropolitan magistrate's court of ABM Abdul Fattah sentenced Milon under the emergency powers rules. He was accused of disrupting public security and destroying the national economy through looting. Sub-inspector Golam Mahfiz, plaintiff and investigating officer, filed a general diary against Milon with Ramna Police Station, and basing on it, the police report was submitted to court. "The accused person (Milon) patronises crimes in his area. He is a threat to public security. He has earned a lot of wealth through corruption. People were afraid of him and nobody dared to complain against him." He said, "The accused should be in jail until the investigation is completed." Police did not pray for remand to quiz him. Milon's lawyers Sanaullah Miah, Mohammed Shahjada and Mohammed Ali appealed for providing him with division in jail. They also appealed for his treatment. They said that he was a popular local leader, and that the case against him was false. Earlier, Rapid Action Battalion members Tuesday arrested the former BNP lawmaker in Gulshan, accusing him of embezzling relief. RAB additional director general Gulzar Uddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com: "Milon was arrested when he was travelling in a car." bdnews24.c
