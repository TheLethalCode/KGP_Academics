 KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip, Sept 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Men keep watch from windows, others guard the street as members of Fatah gather discreetly at a comrade's home in the Gaza Strip to discuss the movement's fate since Hamas seized control of the enclave. They dominated Palestinian politics for decades under Yasser Arafat and are led by his successor as president, Mahmoud Abbas. But in Gaza, away from their West Bank power base, Fatah members feel like a clandestine opposition after the rout of Abbas's forces in June by the Islamists of Hamas. Of the 10 men meeting last week, most said they had been detained by Hamas this summer. None would be identified. Three said they had already been tortured -- a feature of mutual recriminations between the factions over the past three months. Yet there are signs, including public shows of defiance in the past two weeks, that Fatah is regrouping to challenge the new status quo in Gaza. It is a challenge Hamas leaders say they will resist if it resorts to force. With anger running deep on both sides, the potential for renewed bloodletting is clear. Though talk at the clandestine meeting dwelt on the reverses Fatah has suffered, Fatah leaders talk publicly of a comeback. "Fatah will rise again, stronger than ever," said Adel al-Najar from Khan Younis. "Fatah was born to be victorious." Saying that he himself had been among some 100 Fatah members detained since Hamas seized Gaza in several days of fighting, Najar said: "Fatah has become a de facto banned organisation. "You're not allowed to raise a flag. You're not allowed to play nationalist songs," he added, though in fact, yellow Fatah flags have become increasingly commonplace in Gaza, including at open-air weekly prayer meetings held on the past two Fridays. Sami Abu Zuhri, a Hamas official, accused Fatah leaders in the West Bank of planning to destabilise and "uproot" the Islamist party which won last year's parliamentary election: "We have concrete information about orders and money given to people in order to form armed cells in Gaza with the aim of reestablishing chaos and anarchy," he said, while stressing that Fatah members who eschewed violence were free to operate. Explaining the detention of Fatah activists, he added: "We summoned some of those involved who provided information and they were later released after they pledged not to act on any such orders they had received." But, he warned: "Anyone proven to have been involved in provoking chaos will naturally pay the price." Another Fatah official, Hazem Abu Shanab, said however that in Gaza the group had no intention to go underground or use force. "We are operating out in the open and are very proud of our membership of Fatah," he said. There has been occasional violence since June -- scuffles, shootings and blasts targeting property. But the most notable Fatah defiance has been in the outdoor prayers, and weddings. At one recent ceremony, the groom, a son of a senior Fatah leader in Gaza, fired an assault rifle in the air despite a Hamas ban on such traditional celebratory shooting while friends and relatives danced amid a sea of yellow Fatah banners. Fatah has been buoyed by the large turnout at such events. "This kind of wedding is also a stage to demonstrate that Fatah still exists in the Gaza Strip," Fatah's Abu Shanab said. By contrast, political rallies need two days' notice and the approval of Hamas-run authorities. No significant demonstrations have been permitted and Hamas leaders were this week considering whether to ban open-air prayers on the grounds they are rallies. The groups trade accusations of torture -- discomfort, sleep deprivation, and beatings -- in jails in Gaza and the West Bank. "They beat me for a long time. I could hardly breathe," one Fatah security officer told Reuters in Gaza, asking not to be identified. "They aim to humiliate Fatah and break our spirit." In the West Bank, where Hamas says some 500 people have been detained, one member said he was held for 34 days. His jailers threatened to throw him from a rooftop -- a reference to the fate of one Fatah fighter during the fighting in Gaza in June. "I have tasted unbelieveable torture. I saw death several times," said the 30-year-old, who also asked not to be named. Perhaps the best illustration of Fatah's slow resurgence is the growing street popularity in Gaza of one of the few senior leaders of the faction to stand and fight in June. Along with yellow party flags, banners showing Samih al-Madhoun, a Fatah militant captured and killed by Hamas gunmen during the battles, are selling well, shopkeepers say. Cassettes of songs hailing him as "The Earthquake" play in homes and cars. Nor is grassroots sentiment limited to fighting men. Sabrin, wearing a locket showing Madhoun round her neck, said: "I love Samih and hope all Fatah men will be like him." As Fatah looks for ways to come back from the disaster of June, the song in its Gaza strongholds runs: "Samih al-Madhoun is the warrior for whom Fatah will rise like ocean wave
