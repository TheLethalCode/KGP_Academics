 MADRID, Sept 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French and Spanish police arrested four suspected members of the Basque separatist guerilla group in Cahors, south-west France, early on Saturday, Spain's Interior Ministry said in a statement. Amongst those detained is one of the most knowledgeable explosive experts in ETA, who has returned to the armed rebel group after several years in Latin America, newspaper El Pais reported, citing Interior Ministry sources. No-one at the Ministry was immediately available to confirm these details. Basque rebels ETA said on June 5 they were calling off a 15-month-old ceasefire, which it had already effectively broken by bombing Madrid airport in December. Spain's socialist government had attempted peace talks with ETA last year but called them off after the airport bomb, which killed two people. ETA has waged an armed campaign for independence for Basque territories in northern Spain and southern France for over 40 years, killing more than 800 people. Polls show most inhabitants of the Basque Country, which already enjoys considerable autonomy, do not want full separation from Spain. bd
