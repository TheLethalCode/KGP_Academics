 Dhaka, Sept 1 (bdnews24.com)  The police Saturday sought residents' cooperation in exposing the people behind the recent campus protests that spilled out of Dhaka University into the streets. In a statement, the Dhaka Metropolitan Police said a number of "rowdy elements" rampaged through the capital after the initial violence broke out at Dhaka University on Aug 20. It said the disturbing elements set fire to vehicles and damaged public property in parts of Dhaka that followed through Aug 21-22 in violation of the emergency powers rules. Also, the "unruly section" attacked security officials and obstructed their jobs during the most tumultuous days since the state of emergency had been imposed in mid-January, according to the statement. An investigation was underway to unmask the people behind the incident, and for this any information furnished by the public would be treated in the highest confidence, it said. Three days of violence on the campuses and the streets across the country left one people dead and about 300 others injured as the protesters clashed with the security officials. The government later imposed a curfew to quell the unrest, and it seems the military-backed administration has been successful to do so. Scores of arrests that also involve five university teachers followed the curfew. A number of cases have been filed with Mirpur, Dhanmondi, Kotwali, Sutrapur, Shahbagh, New Market, Gulshan, Ramna, Mohammadpur, Lalbagh and Motijheel police stations involving the violence. Any street protest and public show of political gathering are barred when a state of emergency is in place in the country since it curbs many basic rights. bdnews24.
