 MOSCOW, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin and First Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov toured a navy base and played ten-pin bowling together on Wednesday, underlining a closeness analysts say marks out Ivanov as the likely successor. The question of who will take over from Putin next year at the end of his final term is dominating Russian politics. Whoever the hugely popular Putin endorses to replace him is expected to win the March 2008 presidential election. Over the last few months, the normally austere Putin has often been seen in public smiling and joking with Ivanov and calling him Seryozha -- the more informal version of Sergei.

"Amongst political experts there is a growing consensus on Sergei Ivanov's chances of taking the presidential post," Lipman said. Like Putin, the 54-year-old Ivanov is a former Soviet spy and also comes from St Petersburg. Opinion polls place him as the favourite for the presidency, followed by fellow First Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. Last week, a Kremlin spokesman said Putin would favour a well-known public figure to succeed him. But Ivanov, like all other pro-Kremlin front runners, has always denied he has presidential ambitions. Analysts have also spoken of a third option where Putin favours a person not in the public eye.
