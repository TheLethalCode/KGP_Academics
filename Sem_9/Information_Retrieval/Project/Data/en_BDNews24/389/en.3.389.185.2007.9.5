 Rajshahi, Sep 5 (bdnews24.com)  A court Wednesday sent three more teachers of Rajshahi University to jail after their surrender. The three RU teachers who turned themselves in to Rajshahi Metropolitan Speedy Trial Tribunal are mass communication and journalism department associate professors Dulal Chandra Biswas, Selim Reza Newton and Abdullah Al Mamun. They join three of their colleagues Saidur Rahman, Abdus Sobhan and Moloy Kumar Bhowmik, now in jail at the end of their remand. The six teachers have been accused in a charge sheet linked to a case filed under emergency powers rules of inciting student violence. At around 12:15pm, Dulal, Newton and Mamun appeared before court with their counsels Monsur Rahman, Ehsan Ahmed and Mohan Kumar Saha appealing for their bail. The court, however, refused bails as the charges were pressed under the emergency powers rules. The lawyers then appealed for division to the three teachers in jail on the grounds that they are respectful persons and there were no warrants of arrest against them. Opposing the appeal, court sub-inspector (SI) Shamsul Islam said the three had breached law and emergency powers rules. Judge Fazlul Karim ordered jail authorities to make arrangements for their division. On August 22, students of Rajshahi University clashed with the police in the aftermath of violence in Dhaka University, leaving a rickshaw puller dead. Security forces detained former vice-chancellor Saidur Rahman, convener of RU Progressive Teachers' Society Abdus Sobhan, and management teacher Moloy Kumar Bhowmik. Later, the police filed two cases against some 1,500 people under emergency powers rules. On Aug. 25, the three teachers were taken into remand and on Sept. 1 police pressed charges in the two cases. Investigation officer SI Nasir Uddin pressed charges against the three teachers in the cases for provoking vandalism and provocation filed by SI Faruk Hossain. In another case filed on charge of arson of a DGFI vehicle, investigation officer Mukter Hossain submitted charge sheet against teacher of geology and mine studies Golam Shabbir Sattar Tapu, Sarwar Jahan Sajal and public relations officer Sadikul Islam. Bangladesh Chhatra League's RU chapter general secretary Ayen Uddin and Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal's ex-organising secretary Anwar Hossain Ujjal were also accused in the case filed by DGFI director Shawkat Ali. bdnews24.com/
