 Dhaka, Sep 1 (bdnews24.com) -- The Bangladesh Nationalist Party Saturday marked its 29th founding anniversary in a low-key fashion. BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan placed a wreath at the grave of the late president Ziaur Rahman, founder of the BNP. But BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia could not make it to the wreath-laying ceremony in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar. "Madam (Khaleda) couldn't come here. It's unfortunate," Bhuiyan told reporters after placing the wreath amid tight security. Law enforcers allowed no more than 20 leaders and workers in a group to place wreaths for security reasons as the country is passing through a state of emergency. The site was heavily guarded by police and RAB officers and intelligence agents. bdn
