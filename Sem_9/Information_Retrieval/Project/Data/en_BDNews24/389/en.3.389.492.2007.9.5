<TITLE> Sony Ericsson president to resign </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Stockholm, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mobile handset maker Sony Ericsson said on Tuesday its president, Miles Flint, would step down and would be succeeded by Sony Electronics USA Chairman Hideki "Dick" Komiyama as of November 1. Flint's resignation came as a surprise to analysts, who applauded his performance but highlighted the challenge his successor will face as the firm tries to stay profitable while stealing market share from entrenched rivals. "He has done a very good job because of the market share gains and the profitability that Sony Ericsson has achieved," said Kulbinder Garcha, analyst at Credit Suisse in London. Analysts said Flint had in no sense had been forced out, as the company's owners were pleased with what he had achieved. Komiyama, Flint's successor, is also executive vice president of electronics marketing and sales strategies for Sony Corp, the Swedish-Japanese 50-50 venture said. Flint said in a statement he wanted to develop new personal and business opportunities after nearly 17 years at Sony and Sony Ericsson. "I believe that, together, we have in place very firm foundations for the next phase of Sony Ericsson's growth, and I wish Dick Komiyama every success in his new role," Flint said. Ericsson shares were down 0.2 percent at 25.54 crowns at 0813 GMT, less than the Swedish bourse overall. DAUNTING CHALLENGES "It's surprising. He has been doing a great job the last couple of years," Greger Johansson, analyst at Redeye in Stockholm, said of Flint. Johansson said that after working hard to get Sony Ericsson to where it is, Flint may have simply wanted a break and that the task of taking the company further looked daunting. "I think Sony Ericsson has reached a level where it's kind of hard to take the next step," Johansson said. Credit Suisse's Garcha said Sony Ericsson would have a tough time targeting new areas since the company was predominantly a mid- to high-end phone maker. "If they're going to the low end it's going to be margin-dilutive but probably for the long term it's going to be necessary," he said. Flint joined Sony Ericsson from Sony Europe in June 2004. Under his leadership, the company rose to number four in the global mobile handset industry, Sony Ericsson said. Nokia, Motorola and Samsung are all still ahead of Sony Ericsson in terms of market share. In the second quarter, the firm reported a 55 percent jump in quarterly profits to 327 million euros ($446 million), although that missed market expectations. Average selling prices for Sony Ericsson phones fell to 125 euros from 145 euros in the year-earlier period, underlining a shift to lower-cost phones. The average selling price is a key indicator for the industry as it is seen as a major factor for profitability. Komiyama said the global mobile handset industry faced exciting developments, with the convergence of audio and video technologies in mobile communications. "New services and applications are becoming increasingly important to both operators and consumers, and I look forward to bringing to Sony Ericsson my experience in consumer marketing with a deep understanding of customer relationships," he said. bdn
