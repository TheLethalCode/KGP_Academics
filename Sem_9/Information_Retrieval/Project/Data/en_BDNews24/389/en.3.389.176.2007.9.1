 BERLIN, Sept 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A cooperation deal struck last month between Iran and the UN nuclear watchdog offers Tehran what may be its last chance to come clean about its atomic programme, the agency's head Mohamed Elbaradei said. Under the deal, the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Tehran agreed on a rough timetable for addressing lingering concerns about Iran's nuclear activities. "There are hopeful, positive signs. For the first time we've agreed with the Iranians on a sort of roadmap, on a timetable to resolve outstanding questions," Elbaradei told German weekly Der Spiegel. "By November, or December at the latest, we should be able to see whether the Iranians are sticking to their promises. If they fail to do this, Tehran would be missing a great chance -- perhaps its last," he added. Elbaradei did not say what should happen if Iran failed to cooperate under the new deal. Iran says its nuclear programme is for peaceful civilian energy purposes, but the United States and its European allies believe Tehran is pursuing atomic weapons. The UN Security Council has imposed two sets of sanctions on Tehran since December and Washington has not ruled out the use of military force to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear bomb. Elbaradei said he expected Iran to provide information over the coming months on the extent and nature of its nuclear enrichment activities and to address studies in the IAEA's possession that raise questions about Tehran's intentions. "What will be decisive to our assessment is whether Iran fully and actively cooperates with us," he told Der Spiegel.
