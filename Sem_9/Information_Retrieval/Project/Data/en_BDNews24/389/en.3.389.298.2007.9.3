<TEXT>
 BRIDGETOWN, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Captain Ramnaresh Sarwan said he has no problem with the West Indies being considered underdogs in the inaugural Twenty20 World Cup. "We are always listed as underdogs but that is no problem for us," Sarwan told reporters before the team's departure for South Africa on Sunday. "We know our ability and we know what we have to do. We have a very good team and I'm pleased with the players assembled for the tournament. "It's just 20 overs so you have to hit the ground running." Sarwan said West Indies boasted a powerful bowling line-up for the Sept 11-24 tournament. "We have some quality fast bowlers and we have Pedro (Collins) returning to the team. Fidel (Edwards) is bowling really well and really fast so we have some penetration up front. We are confident." Sarwan, 27, missed the two Twenty20 internationals and the one-day series in England, which West Indies won 2-1, because of a shoulder injury but is confident of holding his place. "We played well in England with Chris (Gayle) as captain and I am just hoping to fit back into the side and continue the momentum." The West Indies open the tournament against South Africa at the Wanderers in Johannesburg on Sept 11 and play in the same city against Bangladesh two days later. "It could be anybody's tournament. You can't predict a winner. South Africa will have some momentum as they will be at home and Bangladesh will be a plucky team as well.
