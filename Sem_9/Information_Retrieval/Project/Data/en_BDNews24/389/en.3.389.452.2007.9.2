 Dhaka, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com)A special court Sunday sentenced former minister Mirza Abbas's wife to a total of 16 years in two cases of tax evasion and concealing information about tax. Judge Amar Kumar Roy of the Special Judge's Court-2 handed Afroza Abbas four separate jail terms amounting to 16 years. In one case, involving two counts of charges, Afroza was given three years for tax evasion under the Income Tax Act, and another five years for concealing information under the same law. The court also fined her Tk 12 lakh or another six months behind bars on failure to pay the fine. In the second case, the same judge sentenced Afroza to another two terms of three and five years on two counts of charges, and fined her a massive Tk 4.7 crore, or a further one-year's jail on failure to pay the fine. In his verdict, the judge said the four jail terms would come into effect simultaneously, meaning the prisoner would have to serve only the maximum five-year prison term. Afroza however is currently still evading arrest. The punishment will come into effect from the day she is arrested or surrenders. bdnews24.
