 Dhaka, Sept 1 (bdnews24.com) - After a flying start in the 7th Asia Cup Hockey, Bangladesh suffered a 6-0 defeat to China in their Pool B second match at the Radhakrishnan Memorial Stadium in Chennai Saturday. Bangladesh, who thrashed Thailand 13-0 in their opening match Friday, went three goals down in 14 minutes in the first half against new giants China, who lost to India 1-0 in their first match. China converted three goals out of four penalty corners and scored remaining goals from field. "We played well against China, but they went ahead converting the penalty corners as they hit the board thrice out of four penalty corners," manager Mohammad Yousuf Ali told bdnews24.com by phone from the south Indian city soon after the match. "We got three penalty corners, but could not convert any of them," added Ali. Bangladesh, whose target is to finish sixth in the 11-nation tournament, will take on Sri Lank on Monday at the same venue.
