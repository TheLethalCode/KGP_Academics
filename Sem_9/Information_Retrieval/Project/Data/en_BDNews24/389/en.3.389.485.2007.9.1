<TEXT>
 Sept 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said in London on Saturday she had not yet reached a power-sharing deal with President Pervez Musharraf but will return to Pakistan "very soon" after eight years of self-exile. Here are five facts on Bhutto. Born into a prominent political family in Karachi on June 21, 1953, Benazir Bhutto is the daughter of Pakistan's first popularly elected leader, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. After gaining degrees in politics at both Harvard and Oxford universities, she returned to Pakistan in 1977, just before the military seized power from her father. She inherited leadership of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) after her father's controversial execution in 1979. First voted in as prime minister in 1988, Bhutto was sacked by the then-president on corruption charges in 1990. She took power again in 1993 after her successor, Nawaz Sharif, was forced to resign in a row with the then-president. Bhutto was no more successful on her second try as prime minister and Sharif was back in power by 1996. In 1999, both Bhutto and her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, were sentenced to five years in jail and fined $8.6 million on charges of taking kickbacks from a Swiss company hired to fight customs fraud. But a higher court later overturned the conviction as biased. Bhutto, who had made her husband investment minister during her 1993-1996 rule, was abroad at the time of her conviction and chose to remain in exile. In 2006 she joined an Alliance for the Restoration of Democracy with arch rival Sharif, but the two disagreed over strategy for dealing with military leader Pervez Musharraf. Bhutto decided it was better to negotiate with Musharraf, while Sharif has refused to have any dealings with the general.
