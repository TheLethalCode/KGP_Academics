<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com) Dhaka stocks climbed to a new high in midday trade Monday, on anticipation of rights or bonus shares to be issued by banks after the government raised their minimum capital to Tk 2.0 billion from Tk 1.0 billion. It was the sixth day of gains on the bourse. Limited investment avenues elsewhere also brought investors to the market as banks now sit idle with Tk 142.79 billion of excess funds. "It appears that the market will continue to be buoyant as thousands of crore taka remain idle in the banks," said Moin Al Kashem, a market expert. An amendment in the Banking Companies Act 1991 raising banks' capital requirements to Tk 2.0 billion from Tk 1.0 billion is maintaining the uptick in bank stocks. The government approved the revision last week. The DGEN or general index gained 30.38 points or 1.20 percent to 2547.11 at 11.48 am. The DSI or all-share price advanced 24.46 points or 1.15 percent to 2136.34. A total of 3,507,313 shares worth Tk 1.15 billion were traded. Some 97 issues gained, 49 fell and eight held steady. Market major Power Grid Company of Bangladesh led the gains followed by BRAC Bank. Power Grid rose to Tk 623, up from Tk 612.75 on Sunday. BRAC Bank touched a new high of Tk 1130 from Tk 1122. Prime Bank rose to Tk 768 from Tk 739 after clarifying its position against reports of its share scam. AB Bank hit a new high of Tk 2415 from Tk 2387.25. National Bank however dropped to Tk 1296 from Tk 1323.3. DESCO moved up, Summit Power and Square Pharma slipped, while the City Bank held steady. bdn
