<TITLE> Clooney tackles corruption in new film </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 VENICE, Sep 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - George Clooney plays a burned out 'fixer' for a New York law firm in his latest movie, which tackles corporate corruption, personal greed and the moral dilemmas people face at the workplace every day. Tony Gilroy makes his directorial debut with 'Michael Clayton', in competition at the Venice film festival where it has its world premiere on Friday. Clooney, 46, who has a home in Italy and is a favorite in Venice, said he was not paid for playing the title role, underlining his habit of mixing Hollywood blockbusters with smaller-budget films tackling topical issues. Clayton is called at all hours to iron out clients' and employees' legal problems, and also has to deal with a gambling habit, personal debts and a complicated family life that leave him depressed and morally adrift.

"He's a man at the end of his rope, basically, he's used up all his options and everything is closing in on him," Clooney told reporters after the film was screened to the press. Early reviews of the movie and his performance have been good. Gilroy said he wanted to explore not only corporate culture and corruption, but more importantly the individuals inside companies and why they do what they do. "All these corporations that you're talking about, they're all inhabited by people," he said. "It's all decisions, people in rooms, people decide. "And people go home and they love their children and they see their kids, but every day they go back and they make little small paper cuts on their morality." MORALLY BANKRUPT Perhaps the most morally bankrupt of all the characters in the film is in-house counsel Karen Crowder, played by British actress Tilda Swinton. Determined to settle a lawsuit worth millions of dollars to her employer, she stops at nothing to push the deal through. "I've all my life wondered (what) it takes people to do inhuman things," she said. "(The film) takes each inhuman decision and looks for the human point of decision in it." Clayton gets sucked into a dangerous cover-up when a colleague and friend threatens to expose the swindle. Clooney was visibly irritated when asked if his endorsement of products for big companies clashed in any way with his performance in a film about corporate greed and corruption. "I'm not going to apologize to you for trying to make a living once in a while," he said. "I don't really have an answer for you on that. It's sort of an irritating question." After switching off his microphone, he continued to mutter angrily, although it was inaudible to the audien
