<TEXT>
 MADRID, Sep 01 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona's Cameroon striker Samuel Eto'o is to undergo surgery on the thigh injury he picked up during the week. The operation will take place on Saturday morning, the club said on their Web site (www.fcbarcelona.com). Eto'o suffered a partial tear of a tendon in his right thigh two minutes after coming on as a substitute in Wednesday's 5-0 victory over Inter Milan in the Gamper Trophy. On Thursday, the club said they expected Eto'o to be sidelined for at least two months. The three-times African Player of the Year missed a large chunk of last season after injuring his right knee during a Champions League match against Werder Bremen in September 2006. Having signed Thierry Henry in the close season and with youth team players Giovani dos Santos and Bojan Krkic pushing for places in the senior squad alongside Lionel Messi, Ronaldinho and Eidur Gudjohnsen, Barcelona have no shortage of attacking players.
