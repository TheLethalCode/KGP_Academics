<TEXT>
 ISLAMABAD, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's Supreme Court began hearing legal challenges to President Pervez Musharraf's rule on Wednesday, adding to the woes the embattled US ally faces as he prepares to secure another term. Musharraf, who is also army chief, hopes to get re-elected by the national and provincial assemblies some time between Sept. 15 and Oct. 15. A general election is due around the year-end. But Musharraf, who seized power in a 1999 coup, has seen his popularity slide since he tried to dismiss the chief of the Supreme Court in March. At the same time, the government is under attack by militants who are believed to have engineered Tuesday's suicide bombings near the army headquarters in the city of Rawalpindi that killed 25 people, including staff of the main intelligence agency. Musharraf has turned for help with his political plans to former prime minister Benazir Bhutto in the hope that a power-sharing deal would boost his legitimacy and support and help him overcome constitutional hurdles to remaining in power. The United States and other Western allies hope a pact between the old rivals would bring stability and help sustain Pakistan's efforts in the war on terrorism. The Supreme Court, presided over by the chief justice Musharraf tried to fire in March, began hearing three petitions against the president filed by his opponents, who include lawyers and Islamist politicians. The challenges centre on Musharraf's holding of the posts of president and army chief at the same time and his seeking another term as president, which opponents say is unconstitutional. "Our battle, our struggle, is against the system," A.K. Dogar, a lawyer for the Pakistan Lawyers' Forum which filed one of the petitions, told the court in a reference to military rule. The legal threat to Musharraf's presidency has added urgency to efforts to strike a political deal with two-time prime minister Bhutto. Both sides reported progress after talks in Dubai on Tuesday. Bhutto wants Musharraf to step down as army chief. She is seeking immunity from prosecution for herself and others who ruled in the late 1980s and 1990s and the lifting of a third term for prime ministers. She also wants presidents stripped of the power to dissolve the National Assembly and dismiss governments. In return, her party would help clear the way for him to run for re-election after he quits as army chief by backing an amendment waiving a bar on state servants running for office. But many members of Musharraf's ruling party oppose a deal that could clear the way for their old rival, Bhutto, to return to power and sideline them. Bhutto faces opposition from within her party for negotiating with the unpopular president. Another looming problem for Musharraf is the prime minister he ousted in 1999, Nawaz Sharif, who has vowed to return from exile on Sept. 10 to try to end Musharraf's rule. The government says he was allowed to leave in 2000 under an agreement, guaranteed by Saudi leaders, to 10 years exile. A Saudi official urged Sharif on Tuesday to honour his commitment not to go back, a Saudi Press Agency report said. But a spokesman for Sharif said he was sticking to his plan, and added that up to 250 party activists had been detained by authorities in an attempt to harass his supporters. "They're really in a panic because of Mr Nawaz Sharif's return," said spokesman Ahsan Iqbal. Police denied any round-up. As a last resort, Musharraf could impose emergency rule or declare martial law, although he has ruled that out. But Tuesday's bomb attacks have only added pressure. "The failure of the government's anti-terror policy is no more in doubt," the Dawn newspaper said. "If the government does not move towards the establishment of a broad-based civilian government our army will remain bogged down in an unwinnable guerrilla wa
