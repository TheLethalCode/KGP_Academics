 ATHENS Sun Sep 2,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Greece's first autumn rains on Sunday raised hopes of dousing forest fires that have killed 63 people while a grieving village buried a mother and her four children who perished in the flames. Firefighters were still battling blazes, mainly in the southern Peloponnese region, but rains in northern Greece were heading south and could help, the fire brigade said. "We are expecting some rains in the Peloponnese but we are not certain they will be intense enough to put out the fires," said fire brigade spokeswoman Sofia Mendi. "Today is a critical day because we have strong winds." In the village of Artemida, perched on a charred Peloponnese mountain, locals held the funeral of the mother found dead still clutching her children, the most tragic image of the inferno's trail of destruction. "Our only hope is that they did not suffer too much, that they died from the smoke," said a distraught relative who declined to be named. The fires have raged for 10 days, forcing thousands to flee their homes, burning villages and large swathes of forest. The conservative government has come under criticism for its handling of the crisis ahead of parliamentary elections on September 16. Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis, who has blamed arsonists for the fires, has called for national unity. His administration has doled out at least 107 million euros ($146.2 million) in compensation. "It can't be a coincidence," he told the Kathimerini paper on Sunday, vowing again to punish the culprits. "Facts, eyewitnesses and police findings indicate intent." The opposition socialist PASOK party has criticized the government but seems unable to capitalize on its woes. Opinion polls show the ruling New Democracy party holding a 2 percentage point lead over PASOK but support for both parties has waned since the fires began. The fires nearly destroyed ancient Olympia, the birthplace of the Olympics, and their damage to the economy is estimated at 1.2 billion to 4 billion euros. The European Commission said it could provide up to 200 million euros from a 'solidarity fund'. Many Greeks believe rogue land developers set fires to make way for new construction. The World Conservation Union (IUCN), a Geneva-based global network of state and non-governmental groups, said inadequate rural planning had made the fires almost inevitable. "Greece... will continue to face these crises year after year until legal and institutional issues pertaining to land development, changes in rural demographics and the collapse of traditional farming practices are addressed," said IUCN's Bill Jacks
