 LONDON, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Liverpool thrashed Derby County 6-0 at Anfield on Saturday to go top of the Premier League for the first time since November 2002. Liverpool's stay might last for only 24 hours until overnight leaders Chelsea visit Aston Villa on Sunday. Two goals from Xabi Alonso and Fernando Torres and one apiece by Ryan Babel and substitute Andriy Voronin helped the Merseysiders crush bottom team Derby who have one point from their opening five matches and are the only team without a win. "I am really pleased with my team and we are playing well, scoring goals and keeping clean sheets," enthused Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez on the club's Web site (www.liverpoolfc.tv) afterwards. "It's good for our supporters to see us top of the league but we now have to keep it going and keep working hard in every game we play. "We scored six good goals and it's good to see Torres and Voronin scoring. Kuyt worked so hard and was unlucky not to score and I really liked Babel's goal." DEBUT GOAL Everton went second with a 2-1 victory at Bolton Wanderers thanks to a last-minute winner from Joleon Lescott after Ayegbeni Yakubu, who moved to Everton from Middlesbrough for a club record fee of 11.25 million pounds ($22.72 million) this week, scored 11 minutes into his debut. Nicolas Anelka scored for Bolton. Liverpool have 10 points, the same as Everton and Chelsea with Manchester City, who play at Blackburn Rovers on Sunday, next on nine. Champions Manchester United, who failed to win their opening three games, won 1-0 for the second successive week to continue their climb up the table. They welcomed old midfield warhorse Roy Keane back to Old Trafford for the first time as Sunderland manager and then had to work hard to beat his resilient side. The breakthrough came after 71 minutes when Louis Saha, on as a halftime substitute to end a six-month injury layoff, headed home from a corner taken by Nani. OWEN SCORES Michael Owen, also regaining full fitness, scored in the 87th minute to give Newcastle United a 1-0 win over Wigan Athletic, who had Kevin Kilbane sent off. Owen dashed between two defenders to pounce three minutes from time to add to the goal he scored in mid-week -- his first for Newcastle after 20 injury-hit months. Fulham stormed back from 2-0 and 3-1 down to force a 3-3 draw with Tottenham Hotspur at Craven Cottage while Middlesbrough beat Birmingham City 2-0. West Ham United avenged last season's 6-0 defeat at Reading by winning 3-0 at the Madejski Stadium. The home team also missed a penalty. On Sunday Arsenal host Portsmouth, Chelsea travel to Aston Villa and Blackburn Rovers play Manchester City
