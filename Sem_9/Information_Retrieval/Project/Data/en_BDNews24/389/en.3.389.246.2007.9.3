<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission Sunday night sued Khaleda Zia and her son Arafat Rahman Coco for their links to corruption. A deputy director of the ACC, Golam Shahriar Chowdhury, filed the case against 13 people, including the two, with Tejgaon Police Station. The former prime minister is accused of appointing Global Agro Trade Company (GATCO) as a contractor for both the Inland Container Depot in Kamalapur and the Chittagong port on March 1, 2003 without following a proper bidding procedure. GATCO, a private handling company, is often blamed for inefficiency in handling containers. The shady recruitment of GATCO and subsequent problems arising from it cost the state coffers Tk 1,000 crore, according to case details. Khaleda is facing allegations of abusing power as prime minister. The case was filed at 11:15pm. According to case details, Khaleda connived with the late shipping minister Akbar Hossain in corruption. The case alleges that the Chittagong Port Authority invited tenders for the handling containers at the Kamalapur ICD and Chittagong Port Container Terminal with conditions that the bidders have to have container "handling experience". But Akbar Hossain and his family members intervened in the process and won favours from Khaleda to hand the work order to GATCO, a company which was described as inefficient and inexperienced. The plaintiff appealed for including the case under the cover of the emergency powers rules. Following are the 13 people listed in the case: Khaleda Zia Retired Commodore Julfiker Ali, former chairman of Chittagong Port Authority (CPA) AM Shahdat Hossain, former chairman of CPA AM Sanwar Hossain, former director of CPA Ahmed Abul Kashem, chief accounts officer of CPA Lutful Kabir, former member of CPA Ismail Hossain Saimon, son of the late shipping minister Akbar Hossain Arafat Rahman Coco, son of Khaleda Syed Galib Ahmed, director of Global Agro Trade Private Limited Company Syed Tanvir Ahmed, director of Global Agro Trade AKM Musa Kazal, director of Global Agro Trade Jahanara Ansar, resident of new DOHS Ehsan Yusuf, director of Global Agro Trade bdnews24.
