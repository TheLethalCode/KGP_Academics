<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 1 (bdnews24.com) - In his desire to become the Bangladesh cricket coach, John Harmer passed about two hours with some national cricketers after being requested by the coach selection panel to visit the training session at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium Saturday. The 65-year old Australian, who delivered a five-hour presentation Friday before the selection panel, worked with former captain Habibul Bashar, Shahriar Nafees, Javed Omar, Tushar Imran, Tapash Kumar Baishya and Shahadat Hossain, indoor and outdoors in Mirpur. Of five-member selection panel, Gazi Ashraf Hossain Lipu, Jalal Ahmed Chowdhury and Lt Col (retd) MA Latif Khan observed Harmer's activities with the players. "Our aim is to find a coach for the national side, and there is no doubt Harmer is technically sound and has a good coaching ability," said Jalal Ahmed Chowdhury. "He presented himself as per our expectation, but it is not possible to measure the degree of his ability at the moment as we also have to see how he directs the team and players," Chowdhury said, "He has the ability to be the Bangladesh coach, but we will have to see whether we get a more skilled coach for the national side." The selection panel had provided video footage of the cricketers to Harmer to rectify players' mistakes that occurred almost every time. "It is a good sign that the batsmen have agreed with Harmer's notion of their common mistakes and we will talk to Harmer about his observations during the short-term training," said Chowdhury. "He have seen video footage and the net session, and have rectified a few minor mistakes we made during the batting session," said Bashar adding that it was not possible to comment on Harmer after having passed just 10 minutes with him. Harmer, a senior coach of the Australian Commonwealth Bank Cricket Academy, has to wait for some time for results, as the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) would decide the matter after interviewing some more candidates. Two other short-listed candidates, Jimmie Siddons and David Houghton, are yet to be interviewed. The board also may consider some others as well.
