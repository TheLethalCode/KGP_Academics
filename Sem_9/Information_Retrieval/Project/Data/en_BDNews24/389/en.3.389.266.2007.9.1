<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 1 (bdnews24.com) - Pricewaterhouse Coopers (PwC), despite being refused earlier, has decided to pursue the government into extending a contract on the Agrani Bank management as its consultant, which expires on Sept 30. "We'll push for the extension again," Syed Abu Naser Bukhtear Ahmed, managing director and chief executive officer of Agrani Bank, hired by PwC, told bdnews24.com Saturday. Ahmed admitted that the government had earlier rejected an extension proposal. The World Bank approved $250 million in soft loan to Bangladesh for the enterprise growth and bank modernisation project (EGBMP). Under the EGBMP, the government in 2004 appointed PwC of Hong Kong to Agrani Bank for Tk 36 crore, to prepare Agrani for privatisation. PwC, an international consulting firm, took the management charge of the bank in 2004. "The government is unwilling to extend the agreement with PwC because of hefty charges for its consultants," a senior finance ministry official, asking not to be named, told bdnews24.com. He said the salary of Agrani Bank's managing director was a whopping Tk 12 lakh a month, which contradicted the government policy strategy. "The government is also looking for two MDs for state-run Sonali and Janata banks at Tk 5 lakh each," the official said. "An MD of a bank (Agrani), which is smaller in size, can't get a far higher salary than MDs in bigger banks (Sonali and Janata). The fees and costs incurred for hiring these consultants are often unjustified." A director of the seven-member board of Agrani Bank told bdnews24.com that a few consultants in the bank took about Tk 40 lakh a month as charges. "As the MD of the bank, I'll send the extension proposal, decision on which depends solely on the ministry of finance," Bukhtear Ahmed said. Under the EGBMP, the government has put up all the four NCBs for privatisation. Of them, Rupali Bank is in the process of sale to a private owner. A couple of months ago, the Registrar of the Joint Stock Companies and Firms issued licences to the three NCBs as public limited companies, but they were still to get vendor licences. bd
