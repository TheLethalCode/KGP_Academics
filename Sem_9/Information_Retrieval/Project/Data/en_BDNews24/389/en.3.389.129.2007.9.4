<TITLE> Split sinks BNP into deeper crisis </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com)  The arrest of Khaleda Zia has brought out in the open a deep crisis her party was mired in: a broader split in the BNP. The divide became formal when the former prime minister expelled Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan from the party and installed Khandaker Delwar Hossain as acting secretary general. Some 130 leaders including such stalwarts as ZA Khan, Mahbubur Rahman, Chowdhury Kamal Ibne Yusuf, Hafiz Uddin Ahmed, AHM Mofazzal Karim rallied behind Bhuiyan and took a swipe at Khaleda. In sharp contrast, Delwar had only ASM Hannan Shah, to speak of, on his side Monday. A defiant Bhuiyan said he would not bow out and insisted party leaders and workers would not listen to Khaleda. The 62-year-old former prime minister who presided over the administration for 10 years in two terms landed in special prisona house controversially built for the speaker of parliament. Khaleda became the next-door neighbour of her archrival, also former prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, who has been detained in another special jail on the same Jatiya Sangsad complex since July 16. Khaleda was arrested in a morning operation on her cantonment home in a corruption case filed by the Anticorruption Commission and driven straight to court in a security bubble. The BNP chairperson faces allegations of handpicking an "inefficient, inexperienced" private company, GATCO, to handle two state-run container depots in Dhaka and Chittagonga dubious deal that the graft watchdog said cost the state coffers Tk 1,000 crore. At the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court on Monday, a smiling Khaleda appeared out of a car wearing a sari and sunglassesa bag in handamid a sharp media glare and waved to the crowd. One would probably imagine that Khaleda rehearsed the dayshe would be arrested and paraded through the corridors of court. It was more than evident that she was ready for the glare of rolling television cameras, not as a person charged criminally though. Khaleda has been luckier than Hasina. She was not mobbed by the crowd, the way Hasina was. Law-enforcement agencies seemed to have learnt from the Hasina experience. The security arrangement was better than before. The arrest of Khaleda appeared a relief to those who started to believe the emeregcny government was letting Khaleda off the hook, while going after Hasina, who was often critical of the government. Many said the arrest was meant to strike a political balance. Not so, said law adviser Mainul Hosein. "The government has no enmity with anyone. The anticorruption drive is going on with an open mind," he said, hours after Khaleda was arrested. bdnews
