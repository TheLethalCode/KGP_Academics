 ANYANG, South Korea, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nineteen South Korean Christian volunteers held hostage by the Taliban in Afghanistan for six weeks returned home to an uncomfortable welcome on Sunday, thanking their government for saving them from death. A senior Taliban leader told Reuters Seoul had paid $20 million for their release. The South Korean government denies paying any ransom but has been criticised internationally for striking a deal through direct negotiations with the Taliban. "We went to spread God's love and carry out his wishes," freed hostage Lyu Kyung-sik said after arriving. "All of us returned from the being on verge of death and have been given our lives back." The hostages, with their heads bowed, looking sombre and some fighting back tears, stood behind Lyu as he made a brief statement at Incheon airport outside Seoul. He stood between framed pictures of two other hostages shot dead by the Taliban. "All of us owe a big debt to the country and the South Korean people," said Lyu. "When thinking about the trouble we have caused them, it is proper for us to bow deeply and ask for your forgiveness." The six-week standoff gripped the country, leading thousands to join candlelight vigils praying for a safe return. But many harshly criticised the suburban Seoul Saemmul Church that dispatched the group for having a naive world view and putting their government in a bind. Web sites of the country's main Protestant groups and largest Internet portals have been flooded with messages saying the group and church were to blame for ignoring government warnings and making an ill-advised mission to an obvious danger spot. RANSOM AND MISSIONARIES The hostages were whisked away to a hospital south of Seoul where many collapsed into the arms of waiting relatives, who cheered when the group entered a reception room. A few of the group, overcome by emotion, had to be carried out of the room. They were then admitted for medical checks. Ryu Haeng-sik, the husband of one of the hostages who cared for his two daughters while his wife was in captivity, said: "The kids love having their mother back." Seo Jeung-bae was reunited with a son and daughter. "I was given back the two children I had lost. By holding them in my arms, I now know it's real," the smiling father said. The South Korean government said it had only agreed to pull out a small contingent of military engineers and medical staff and to end South Korean missionary work in Afghanistan in return for the release of the hostages. It had already planned to pull all its non-combat troops out before the hostage ordeal. When asked if a ransom had been paid, Kim Man-bok, head of South Korea's spy agency, said at the airport: "There was none at all." Taliban insurgents kidnapped 23 South Koreans in mid-July. They killed two male hostages as initial negotiations stumbled and last month released two women captives. The hostages, mostly women, had flown from Dubai where they had stopped on their way home from Afghanistan. They have spoken of living in constant fear, split up into small groups and shuttled around the Afghan countryside to avoid detection. South Korea is the second largest source of Christian missionaries, after the United States, with an estimated 17,000 abroad. For many Korean churches, the number of missionaries they send abroad is a reflection of the strength of their congregation. Some church leaders said they would rethink their overseas missions but a leading group said the Afghan ordeal had only strengthened its resolve to send more missionaries overseas, even if it meant taking over negotiating hostage releases from the government. bd
