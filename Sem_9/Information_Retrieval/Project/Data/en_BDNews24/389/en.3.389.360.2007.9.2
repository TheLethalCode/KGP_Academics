<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 2 (bdnews24.com) - The International Monetary Fund has asked the government to make data on the latest fuel oil prices available to its visiting team in advance of a planned meeting between the two groups. The agency also asked the government to provide a report on how Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation can advance to a break-even position, according to an IMF letter sent to the finance ministry. An IMF delegation, led by its Asia Pacific Department adviser Thomas Rumbaugh, arrives in Dhaka Tuesday for a two-week visit to discuss a possible successor to the expiring Poverty Reduction Growth Facility programme. The IMF letter was sent on August 15 to finance secretary Mohammad Tareque. It reads: "Please provide the latest retail prices for motor spirit (petrol), octane, kerosene, diesel and JP-1 (jet fuel) that would allow BPC to break even." The multilateral agency asked the government to provide information on 25 different points by September 3 in the letter. An energy ministry official, who asked not to be named, told bdnews24.com Sunday: "On the basis of current international marker prices, the BPC will make a loss of some Tk 2,200 crore in the 2007-08 fiscal year. This will be for subsidising fuel oil imports alone." "On average, the BPC incurs a loss of approximately Tk 10 a litre on diesel and kerosene imports while it makes a profit of about Tk 7 per litre on petrol and octane, according to prices last week," said the official. Diesel on the international market currently costs $87 a barrel. Bangladesh imported some 39 lakh tonnes of fuel oil in fiscal 2006-07, at a cost of $2.3 billion. Diesel accounted for 24 lakh tonnes of fuels, according to energy ministry officials. The IMF and World Bank have pressured the government for some time to adjust domestic fuel oil prices to international market levels. In April the interim government adjusted their fuel oil prices, raising the cost of a litre of diesel and kerosene to Tk 40 from Tk 33. This caused huge problems for low-end users, according to local economists. "In view of the current situation of high inflation and flood recovery the government has no plans to hike the price of any fuel oil," a senior finance ministry official, requesting his anonymity, told bdnews24.com Sunday. bd
