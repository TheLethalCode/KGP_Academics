 Dhaka, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com)  An explosive 81 from opener Nazimuddin Sunday failed to help Bangladesh to avert a 30-run loss to Pakistan in their second match of the four-nation Twenty20 tournament at the Gymkhana Club Ground in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi. Bangladesh, who thrashed Kenya by five wickets Saturday, ended up at 161 for seven in the thrilling chase after Pakistan racked up 191 for seven. Right-hand bat Nazimuddin hammered eight fours and smacked five sixes in just 50 deliveries in the rollicking innings. Bangladesh were well in the hunt for an upset until Nazimuddin was out to leave the Tigers at 128 for five in 14 overs. Yasir Arafat, the most successful Pakistan bowler with two for 26 in four overs, removed the explosive opener to bring his team back in the game. Nazimuddin stuck to one end punishing every Pakistani bowler but hardly got any help from the other end. Alok Kapali made the second highest 19 off 11 balls featuring two fours and one six. Mashrafee Bin Mortaza (10) and Mushfiqur Rahim (1) remained unbeaten while all-rounder Farhad Reza chipped in with 18 off 14 balls with two boundaries. Put in to bat first by skipper Mohammad Ashraful, Pakistan piled up 191 for seven in 20 overs with opener Imran Nazir and one-down Younis Khan scoring 49 and 48 runs. Opener Salman Butt (33 off 27 balls) and Shahid Afridi (32 off 18 balls) helped the to a challenging total. Ashraful claimed three scalps for 42 while Farhad Reza took two wickets but leaked 55 runs in his four overs to become the most expensive Bangladesh bowler. Mashrafee also conceded 53 runs in as many overs. Brief score: Pakistan  191/7 in 20 overs (Salman 33, Imran 49, Younis 48, Shoaib Malik 10, Afridi 32, Misbah-ul-Haq 2, Kamran Akmal 11, Yasir Arafat 2 not out, Shoaib Akhter 3 not out, Ashraful 3/42 and Farhad 2/55). Bangladesh  161/7 in 20 overs (Tamim Iqbal 1, Nazimuddin 81, Aftab Ahmed 5, Ashraful 7, Kapali 19, Mahmuddullah 9, Mashrafee 10 not out, Farhad 18, Mushfiqur 1 not out, Afridi 2/26, Shoaib Akhter 2/30 and Yasir Arafat 1/31). bd
