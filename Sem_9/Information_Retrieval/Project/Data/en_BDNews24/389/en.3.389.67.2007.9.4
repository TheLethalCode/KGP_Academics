 JOHANNESBURG, Sept 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia still believe Ricky Ponting will play a part in the Twenty20 World Cup despite their captain failing to fly out with the squad for the tournament in South Africa, which starts on Sept. 11. "We'll have to wait and see about Ricky, but hopefully he will join us soon, we're just not 100 percent sure when," vice captain Adam Gilchrist told reporters in Johannesburg on Tuesday. "We're taking it day-by-day and keeping in touch with him, but I don't think he'll miss the whole tournament." The Australians arrived in South Africa late on Monday while Ponting remained in Sydney due to "family reasons". Australia's opening game is against Zimbabwe in Cape Town on Sept. 12. The Australians also arrived in Johannesburg without seamer Stuart Clark, whose son is ill, and all-rounder Shane Watson, who has a hamstring problem. Wicketkeeper/batsman Gilchrist said the inaugural Twenty20 World Cup was an important opportunity for Australia to add more silverware to an already burgeoning trophy cabinet. "No one's won this tournament before, so it's a chance for us to make an impression," he said. "There's been nothing up for grabs in the other Twenty20 games we've played, they've been more like exhibitions, but this is different and we're all going to learn a lot.
