 Dhaka, Sep 5 (bdnews24.com) -- Army chief General Moeen U Ahmed Wednesday called the ongoing changes in the country 'new social contract' and rolled out an 11-point formula for the government to help retool the economy. He said the implementation of the formula would help redesign the economy because the previous political system had bred massive corruption. General Moeen made the remarks at a high-profile dialogue between the government and the business leaders at Radisson Water Garden Hotel following businessmen's claims that their level of confidence had recently been eroded. "I call this realisation and change a new social contract that reminds us of our objective at hand and indicates the need for reconciliation in economic development and nation-building," Moeen said in his address to the dialogue in the presence of chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed and finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam. The dialogue was titled "Bangladesh economy: Future perspective." Unlike the previous caretakers, he said that the present one was a "Reformist Caretaker Government" that had received an overwhelming mandate from the people. He said that the majority of the population was still bearing the pressure of high price, relocation, reforms and system improvements. "I appreciate the patience of the people," he noted. The army chief categorically said: "As it (government) is taking some hard decisions, it can't be politically popular." But he believed that the government had a silent popular consent from every citizen of the country. The army chief also spelt out an 11-point cardinal formula that envisaged study and application of judgement to intensify economic activity. His formula included formation of an interim development fund to speed up development works. He said that a body styled Bangladesh economic development committee, which would be responsible to the finance adviser and the business community, might be formed to oversee all economic activities. He suggested disinvesting all government shares to generate money to help the government lay the base of the economy. Moeen also asked the government to generate economic activity at the grassroots within one month. On reduction of bank interest rate and tax cut for people below the poverty level for credit financing and increment of tax network, Moeen said. "There is also a need to appropriately manage the tax policy and its administration cycle." "Avoid harassing the business community by increasing emoluments to the tax, anti-corruption and police departments," the seventh point of his formula mentioned. He said that investment by the expatriate community was to be arranged by holding an international conference of expatriates in November 2007 to inject further capital into the economy. Moeen also stressed utilising the NGOs to substantiate sustained growth and boost export of skilled and semi-skilled manpower. His final point was that a financial dividend scheme for all private sector or self- employed persons be ensured after their retirement. Moeen concluded saying, "We owe much to our country and the people". He said that the new awareness of goodwill today could help us to re-inject our values, adopt an ethical approach with such relevance to understand the crisis with compassion and deal with the offenders vigorously. "I once more call upon the business community to stay above fear, and support the emergence of a new social contract in Bangladesh for our existence," Moeen concluded. Moeen at a seminar on April 2 had put forth a political formula that said Bangladesh needed its 'own brand of democracy'. bd
