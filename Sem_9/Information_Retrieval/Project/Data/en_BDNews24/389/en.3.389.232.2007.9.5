 ASTANA, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kazakhstan's government will make a statement on the future of the Eni-led Kashagan oilfield on Thursday, its prime minister said on Wednesday as a deadline for the Italian firm to make a proposal to pay compensation expired. The Central Asian state suspended work at Kashagan in a shallow part of the Caspian Sea last week in a row with the Eni-led international consortium over delays in oil production and cost overruns. "Tomorrow I will address the Kazenergy conference and will talk about Kashagan," Prime Minister Karim Masimov told reporters in the capital Astana. "You can say that the prime minister will make a statement on Kashagan tomorrow." Deputy Finance Minister Daulet Yergozhin told Reuters on Tuesday that the government was seeking more than $10 billion in compensation for the problems at Kashagan, one of the world's biggest oil finds in three decades. Eni has yet to comment on what it may offer. A senior company official, Stefano Cao, was quoted by Italian newspapers on Wednesday as saying the talks were "open and constructive" and Eni would address the matter in accordance with its current production-sharing agreement with Kazakhstan. Kashagan lies at the heart of Kazakhstan's plans to join the world's top 10 oil producers and is set to double the former Soviet state's crude output over the next decade. But it has been beset by problems. Production has been postponed to the second half of 2010 from 2005 originally and, according to the government, total costs have escalated from $57 billion to $136 billion. The consortium developing Kashagan also includes Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil Corp, Total, ConocoPhillips, Japan's Inpex Holdings Inc and Kazakh state oil and gas company KazMunaiGas. bd
