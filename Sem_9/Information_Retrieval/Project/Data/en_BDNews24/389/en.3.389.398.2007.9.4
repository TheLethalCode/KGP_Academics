 Dhaka, Sept 4 (bdnews24.com)  Some BNP leaders and lawyers went to Sher-e-Bangla Nagar Tuesday to meet detained former prime minister Khaleda Zia in special jail but failed to do so. They had no permission to see their leader and the jail authorities allowed nobody to meet her. At about 11:30am, 10 lawyers led by Jamila Akhter Bulbul, Sabina Yasmin Bina and Siddiqur Rahman came to the jail gate and sought permission to meet Khaleda. At about the same time, some 10 women workers of the BNP led by former lawmaker Helen Zerin Khan came to the jail gate. They also left after waiting for some time. Khaleda was arrested Monday morning in a corruption case and sent to jail. bdnews24
