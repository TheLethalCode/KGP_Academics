<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com)  Newly-installed acting BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain has demanded that authorities immediately free detain party chief Khaleda Zia. Reacting at his NAM Flat home to her arrest Monday afternoon, Delwar expressed his gratitude to the party chairperson for giving the responsibility to him at a time when the party is going through a crucial time. Earlier ASM Hannan Shah, adviser to the BNP chairperson, read out Khaleda's letter on expulsion of BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan and joint secretary general Ashraf Hossain from the party to reporters. The two were expelled from the party on the charge of breaking party's discipline. Khaleda appointed Delwar as new secretary general expelling Bhuiyan prior to her arrest Monday morning. Former chief whip Delwar said the allegations brought against the BNP supremo were baseless, intentional and part of a conspiracy. He said a lawyer would be appointed to free the party leader from jail. "There is no scope for appointing acting secretary general as per the party's constitution. The chairperson can appoint a new secretary general. She made the appointment in the same post," Delwar said when asked he was acting secretary general or not. bdnews24.
