 Dhaka, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Olympic Association (BOA) decided to launch the residential camps for the 2nd Indo-Bangla Games on September 10. The BOA training and facilities committee, headed by Ashraf Uddin Ahmed Chunnu, Sunday sat with the top officials of different federations to discuss the training for the Indo-Bangla Games next January and the 2009 SA Games at home. "We have taken this decision with the consent of federation officials," Chunnu told bdnews24.com Monday. "The training was to have started in July, but we could not arrange training due to shortage of funds. We, however, start the camp with eight disciplines for the Indo-Bangla Games," said the former national footballer. The Indo-Bangla Games include eight disciplines -- football, kabaddi, basketball, volleyball, swimming, shooting, athletics and kho kho. Football, shooting and athletic camps will be held at the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan and the camps of the remaining disciplines will be held in Dhaka. Chunnu said that the BOA would appoint an observer for each camp and that the observer would submit the progress reports of the camps.
