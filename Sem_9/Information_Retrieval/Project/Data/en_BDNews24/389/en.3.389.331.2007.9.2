 Dhaka, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com)  Former state minister for home affairs Lutfozzaman Babar Sunday lost an appeal to the High Court to quash an arms case against him. A bench of Justice Khondoker Musa Khaled and Justice AFM Abdur Rahman rejected the appeal after hearing the prosecution and defence lawyers. The high-profile case, which accuses the former junior minister of illegal possession of a revolver and ammunition, will now proceed, according to assistant attorney general Md Mamunur Rahman. Joint forces arrested Babar on May 28 and the police filed a case against him with Gulshan Police Station shortly after his detention. The trial court framed charges against him on July 25. Barrister Rafique-ul Huq represented Babar in the appeal while additional attorney general Salauddin Ahmed represented the state. bdnews24
