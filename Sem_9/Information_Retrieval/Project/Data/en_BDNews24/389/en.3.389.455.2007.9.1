 Dhaka, Sep 1 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Saturday observed a low-key 29th founding day. BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan placed a wreath at the grave of founder and former president Ziaur Rahman, but party chairperson Khaleda Zia could not make it to the grave because of what authorities termed security reasons. "It's unfortunate that Madam (Khaleda) couldn't come," Bhuiyan told reporters after placing the wreath amid tight security. Law enforcers allowed no more than 20 leaders and workers in a group to place wreaths for security reasons under the state of emergency. Police men, RAB officers and intelligence agents enforced tight security at the scene at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar. Speaker Jamiruddin Sircar and deputy speaker Akhtar Hamid Siddiqui placed wreaths at the grave of the late leader at 10:30am. At 11:20am, 17 BNP leaders led by Bhuiyan offered flowers on behalf of the party. The leaders then took part in a special prayer. This was the first time the so-called reformists and those loyal to the BNP chairperson took part in a programme together since the party was riven by a broader rift during the state of emergency. Senior BNP leader MK Anwar told reporters: "BNP has become a major party with the support of the mass people. Our past activities are being criticised (both by our members and others). Through these criticisms we will proceed. BNP has to be united against odds and hurdles". "It is sad that Begum Khaleda Zia could not come to place wreaths at Shahid Zia's grave. I don't know why," he said. National and party flags were hoisted at the BNP central office and metropolitan office Saturday morning. BNP leader Mofikul Islam Tripti told bdnews24.com they were observing the founding anniversary in consultation with the local administrations across the country. The party distributed relief in flood-battered regions, he said. bdnews24.com/s
