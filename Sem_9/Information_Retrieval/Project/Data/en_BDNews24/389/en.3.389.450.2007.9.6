 Dhaka, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed has said his government is weighing major regulatory reforms to reduce the costs and uncertainties and create an enabling environment for business. "We're considering establishing a high-level regulatory reform committee to examine our laws and regulations to help eliminate those that are redundant or irrelevant," he said at a high-profile dialogue with business leaders at the Radisson Water Garden hotel in Dhaka Wednesday. Fakhruddin disclosed his government's plan in a four-point agenda. Army chief Moeen U Ahmed speaking as special guest at the meeting assured businessmen that they would not be unnecessarily "harassed". General Moeen also rolled out an 11-point formula for the government to help retool the economy. Businessmen had earlier in the meeting urged the government to ensure an enabling environment for businesses. They said a sense of confidence among the business community in the government's economic policies was important to rein in the soaring prices of essentialsa concern that irks the interim administration most. The dialogue, chaired by commerce and finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam, is the first of its kind in Bangladesh. Advisers to the caretaker government, chiefs of three services of the armed forces, political leaders, diplomats, senior civil and military officials, and civil-society members were among those present. Business leaders said they wished to leave the meeting with a sense of security about the future of their enterprises. They also voiced concern over what they said was the government's excessive adherence to the prescriptions of lending agencies. President of the International Chamber of Commence, Bangladesh Mahbubur Rahman said it should not be that the conditions of the lending agencies such as IMF and the World Bank must be fulfilled without any scrutiny. "We have to look to our benefits before fulfilling their conditions," he said. Azizul Islam said the government was serious in curbing prices. The chief adviser further assured businessmen of the caretaker government's commitment to enabling businessmen with his four-point agenda. This includes formation of a 'Bangladesh Better Business Forum', with the government monitoring results based on improved statistics. "We are planning to initiate a quarterly 'survey of business confidence' as is done in many countries so that we can constantly feel the pulse of the private sector," said Fakhruddin. "We would like to see Bangladesh's position improve by at least 15 places in global rankings when the 2009 Doing Business Indicators are published." The World Bank's Doing Business-2007 Survey ranked Bangladesh at 88 out of 168 countries. "We are committed to bringing about changes for creating an enabling environment for business and investment in the country," said Fakhruddin, adding that investors' confidence was a key component of such an enabling environment. "The 11th of January 2007 has opened up opportunities for us to bring about positive changes and reforms in the country and establish good governance. "I am convinced if we can properly explore and make good use of the opportunities before us, then it would certainly be possible to erect a strong foundation for sustainable growth and development of the country," the chief adviser said. However, he said, there may have been some unintended negative fallout: "We have tried to deal with these through consultations with private-sector representatives. "We shall continue to fine-tune our efforts so that undesirable negative fallout are minimised." bdnews24.
