 Dhaka, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com)  Scores of security officers in plainclothes drove into Dhaka cantonment early Monday amid wide speculation about the imminent arrest of Khaleda Zia. Police officers in plainclothes arrived at Khaleda's house on Shahid Mainul Road in the cantonment, house staffer Ruhul Amin told bdnews24.com at 5:40am Monday. Amin said the police asked Khaleda and her son Arafat Rahman Coco to "get ready". At least 10 cars in the first batch drove into the cantonment shortly after 5am, followed by another convoy of up to 25 cars, witnesses reported from the scene. The speculation about the arrest of the former prime minister spread far and wide, hours after the Anticorruption Commission brought a corruption case against her. Khaleda faces allegations of having a role in shady appointment of a private handling company, Global Agro Trade Company (GATCO) as a contractor for the Inland Container Depot in Kamalapur and Chittagong Port Container Terminal. bd
