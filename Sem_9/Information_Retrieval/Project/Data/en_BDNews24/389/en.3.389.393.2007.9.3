 CANBERRA, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia and the United States will outline a new defence pact later this week to give Australia more access to top-secret American military technology, newspapers said on Monday. The security agreement will be outlined by President George W Bush when he addresses Australian troops during his visit to Sydney for an Asia-Pacific leaders' summit, the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper said. Australia's Defence Minister Brendan Nelson refused to comment on the deal, but US Ambassador to Australia Robert McCallum said the pact would be discussed when Bush and Prime Minister John Howard hold talks on Wednesday. "I think one of the very significant things in this potential (deal) is the arranging for greater access for the Australian military, in its purchase of military hardware, to classified and secret technical information about weapons systems and operations," McCallum told Australian television. The development, he said, would allow Australian and US forces to work more closely together on joint military operations stretching from the Middle East to the Pacific. Australia is a strong ally of the United States and has troops alongside US forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Australia-US military alliance is the cornerstone of Australia's defence policy. But Australia has long complained of US restrictions on the use, manufacture and repair of top-secret US weapons technology and information because of Washington's concerns about keeping the information secure from espionage. Both countries are negotiating the A$16 billion ($13 billion) sale of advanced F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, while the US recently agreed to Australia buying 24 FA-18F Super Hornet fighters for A$6.6 billion. Australia is also buying US-built cruise missiles and airborne early warning aircraft for its air force and sophisticated radars for a new fleet of destroyers. Nelson said he had discussed access to US technology during talks in Washington last week with US Defence Secretary Robert Gates and the issue was part of annual AUSMIN talks between senior Australian and US ministers. "We have been working on technology data access issues through the AUSMIN process," Nelson told Australia radio on Monday, adding the two countries were making "a lot of progress" on the issue. bd
