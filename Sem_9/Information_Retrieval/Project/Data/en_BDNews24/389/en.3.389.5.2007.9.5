 Dhaka, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com) The establishment ministry Wednesday asked all government officials to submit their wealth statements for the current year by Dec 31 in line with the rules. A letter, signed by Moyeen Uddin Khandaker, joint secretary (administration) of the ministry, was sent out to different ministries on Aug 28, instructing officials and employees to strictly follow the directive. The letter said: "There is a provision in a code of conduct for government officials and employees, framed 1979, about declaration of increases or decreases in wealth from the dates they enter the service up to the dates they retire." "But the guidelines are not being properly followed." The letter said the government's anticorruption drive would receive an impetus if government employees furnished wealth statements as a "manifestation of their sense of greater responsibility and accountability". A senior official of the establishment ministry, preferring anonymity, told bdnews24.com: "Despite rules and regulations, previous political governments have not followed the guidelines. Following that trend, even under the present government, no government officials have yet furnished wealth statements." He further said the Anticorruption Commission had recently sent a letter to the establishment ministry seeking wealth statements of 40 government employeesa move thought to have alarmed other officials. bdnews24.
