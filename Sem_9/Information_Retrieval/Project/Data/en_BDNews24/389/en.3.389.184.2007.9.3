<TEXT>
 Dhaka,Sep 3 (bdnews24.com)  The government has proved, with the arrest of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, that none is above the law, law adviser Mainul Hosein has said. He made the remark to bdnews 24.com after a Dhaka court sent the former prime minister to a special jail after arrest early Monday. "Khaleda Zia was arrested over specific cases. It won't be possible to ensure safety of life and property until accountability of rulers is ensured by the rule of law. Corruption will not be tackled either." "Arrests of two former prime ministers have proved that the present government is not biased towards any party. It has also proved that it is upholding the law of rule," Mainul added. bdnews24.com/
