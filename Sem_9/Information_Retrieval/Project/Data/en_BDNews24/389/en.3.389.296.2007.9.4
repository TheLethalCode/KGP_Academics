 Dhaka, Sept 4 (bdnews24.com)  India crushed Bangladesh 6-0 to confirm their Asia Cup Hockey semifinal berth in Pool B at the Radhakrishnan Memorial Stadium in Chennai Tuesday. The defeat margin could have been more disgraceful had Bangladesh's goalkeeper Zahid Hossain not spoiled seven penalty corners out of eight. Bangladesh had to satisfy with the man of the match award going to keeper Zahid Hossain. India converted only one penalty corner and found the Bangladesh net five times through field goals. Bangladesh, who thrashed Thailand 13-0 and Sri Lanka 3-2 and lost to China 6-0, halted the defending champions for 31 minutes before Raghunath broke the deadlock with a half swipe shot to beat goalkeeper Zahid, and India left the field with a 1-0 lead in the first half. After the breather, the Bangladesh defence broke down and conceded another three quick goals in the space of eight minutes with Tushar Kandeker, Shivender Singh and Prabhjot scoring one goal each in the 37th, 38th and 44th minutes. Prabhjot made it 5-0 in the 57th minute converting a penalty corner while Raghunath sealed the match netting his second goal four minutes from time. Bangladesh will take on Korea in the final match of their Pool Thursday.
