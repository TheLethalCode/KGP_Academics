 CAIRO, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The outspoken editor of an independent Egyptian newspaper was accused on Wednesday of spreading rumours and false information about the health of President Hosni Mubarak, judicial sources said. The two separate offences could lead to prison terms of three years and one year, they said. The office of the higher state security prosecutor laid the accusations against editor Ibrahim Issa of the newspaper al-Dustour, which in late August published two articles about rumours that Mubarak was either dead or seriously ill. Al-Dustour was not the first Egyptian newspaper to publish the rumours but Issa has a long record of hostility towards the Mubarak family and writes in an especially provocative style. One article, published on Aug. 31, quoted medical sources as saying Mubarak had a problem with the blood supply to his brain that was causing blackouts that could last seconds or minutes. Mubarak's wife Suzanne dismissed the rumours last week, telling Al Arabiya television he was "as fit as a fiddle". Issa has had several confrontations with the authorities and narrowly avoided imprisonment in February when an appeals court overturned a one-year sentence against him for defaming Mubarak. Wednesday's accusations are not formal charges, which would come when the prosecution refers the case to trial, but the accusations could constitute justification for further questioning and possible pre-trial detention. Issa went to the office of the state security prosecutor on Wednesday morning and left to go home more than seven hours later, witnesses said. The first accusation is "propagating false rumours likely to disturb public security, spread fear among people and damage the public interest", and the second is "publishing with malice false news and false rumours", judicial sources, who wished not to be named, told Reuters. Earlier in the week Issa defended his newspaper's handling of the rumours about Mubarak's health. "Why do we make the president's health a military secret?" he told Reuters in an interview. "This shows that the regime cannot manage crises." Egyptian Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif told an investment conference on Wednesday that investors' concerns about the succession to President Mubarak were exaggerated. "He, thank God, has good health. He is on top of things, working well, so there is no immediate concern," he said. He added that the last few transitions of powers in Egypt had been smooth or relatively smooth, including the largely peaceful overthrow of the monarchy in 1952. Opponents of Mubarak and political analysts say his most obvious potential successor is his 43-year-old son Gamal, who has denied having presidential ambitio
