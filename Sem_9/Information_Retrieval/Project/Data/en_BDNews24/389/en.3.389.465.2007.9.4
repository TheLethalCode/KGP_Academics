 Dhaka, Sept 4 (bdnews24.com) -- The United States embassy in Dhaka has cancelled all new diversity visa interviews scheduled for September, it said in a statement Tuesday. "Diversity visas are limited by quota set by the United States Congress. It is not possible to issue more visas than the number which has been allocated," the embassy said. "There are no more visas available for Bangladeshi citizens for DV-2007. Therefore new interviews for the diversity visa are cancelled." Immigration and non-immigration interview appointments remain unchanged. "This change only affects those diversity visa applicants who have not yet had an interview," the statement said. It urged the applicants who have already had their diversity visa interviews not to make any inquiries to the US embassy. The embassy will contact the applicants, with cases still pending, by Sept 30. bd
