 Dhaka, Sep 4 (bdnews24.com) - Finance and commerce adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Tuesday brushed aside the claim of a lack of confidence among businesses and said economic indicators do not back the contention. The adviser said a meeting was designed to find ways for the government to boost confidence further to ensure economic growth. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed and army chief General Moeen U Ahmed will sit with the business community Wednesday to identify the problems. "We want to get suggestions about what more the government can do to bring back confidence to ensure economic growth," Azizul told reporters at his finance ministry office. He made the comments on media queries on Wednesday's scheduled meeting between the chief adviser and the army chief and business leaders. "I've analysed the macro-economic indicators, including import, export, remittance, credit to private sector and import of capital machinery, and found most of them are on track," the finance adviser said. But he admitted that one or two indicators, including import of capital machinery, are not performing well. He said a lack of confidence which the businessmen and media are saying was not reflected in the indicators. "How the perception (confidence) is fact-based and which steps of the government eroded their confidence will be discussed in the meeting," Azizul said. Import of essentials, including rice, wheat, crude oil and pulse was well in the FY 2006-07 compared to the previous fiscal year, the adviser said. He said some 7.14 lakh tonnes of rice, 17.52 lakh tonnes of wheat, 10.53 lakh tonnes of crude oil and 4.25 lakh tonnes of pulse were imported in the FY 2006-07. "This imported volume of essentials is more than that of the previous fiscal year," Azizul added. On the rising price hike, the commerce adviser said the prices of the items have increased on the international market. Moreover, local production was not increased to match the growing demand of the consumers, he noted. Azizul said per capita income has increased 11.1 percent in fiscal 2006-07 from the fiscal 2005-06. But supply was not improved to meet the growing demand, he said. "The government is trying to boost local production and import as well to make up the gap between demand and supply," he added. He said private sector credit growth has come down to 15 percent in fiscal 2006-07 from 18 percent a year ago. He however said industrial term loan (long term loan) rose significantly between the periods. bdnews24.com/sr/bd/ad/1708 hours bdnew
