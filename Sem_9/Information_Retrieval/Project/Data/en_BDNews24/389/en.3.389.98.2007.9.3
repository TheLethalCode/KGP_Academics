 LONDON, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid are enjoying a flying start to their Primera Liga title defence, crushing Villarreal 5-0 on Sunday to make it two wins from two games. Liverpool drew on their reserves of Spanish talent to go top of the Premier League, while Juventus clinched a thrilling late victory in Serie A. SPAIN Champions Real Madrid are setting the early pace in the Primera Liga with a 5-0 demolition of Villarreal in the Madrigal on Sunday, leaving them two points clear at the top after only two games. Impressive Dutch midfielder Wesley Sneijder scored two and set up a third for Raul, as Real remained the only side with a 100 percent record in La Liga after last week's 2-1 win over Atletico Madrid. Brazil forward Ronaldinho scored twice to help Barcelona to their first win of the season, a 3-1 home victory over Athletic Bilbao, and Valencia earned their first points with a laboured 2-1 win at promoted Almeria. Sevilla's game away to Osasuna was postponed as they play AEK Athens in the Champions League third qualifying round, second leg on Monday. ENGLAND Liverpool finished top of the Premier League table after a weekend in which they hammered promoted Derby County 6-0, champions Manchester United edged Roy Keane's Sunderland 1-0 and Chelsea slumped to a surprise 2-0 defeat at Aston Villa. Liverpool's promising new Spanish striker Fernando Torres, who scored twice, now has the Kopites dreaming of a first league title since 1990. They are a whisker ahead of three other clubs who also have 10 points - Arsenal, Everton and Chelsea. Arsenal's 10 men sealed a 3-1 win over Portsmouth, Everton were 2-1 winners at already struggling Bolton Wanderers on Saturday and Chelsea suffered their first defeat of the season at Villa Park. There was no happy homecoming for Keane at Old Trafford, with a Louis Saha strike securing the points in the second half. ITALY Giorgio Chiellini snatched a last-gasp winner for Juventus in an extraordinary 3-2 win at Cagliari. Juve's Jonathan Zebina and Cagliari's Cristiano Del Grosso were sent off in the fiery encounter in Sardinia where the home side equalised twice with debatable penalties before defender Chiellini nodded in Mauro Camoranesi's cross. Roma also have two wins from two after beating Siena 3-0 with Francesco Totti scoring the third late on, having been presented with the European Golden Boot before kick off for his 26 league goals last season. Champions Inter Milan beat Empoli 2-0 away on Saturday thanks to a brace either side of halftime from Zlatan Ibrahimovic. AC Milan host Fiorentina in Serie A on Monday having beaten Sevilla in the European Super Cup on Friday. GERMANY Bayern Munich lost their hundred percent record but the Bavarians still came out of the fourth round of matches with a three-point lead as the chasing teams suffered bad cases of vertigo. Bayern were held 1-1 away to Hamburg SV on Sunday, with a Mohamed Zidan goal three minutes from time cancelling out Miroslav Klose's 100th Bundesliga strike. That left Bayern top with 10 points from four games, followed by a group of five teams on seven. Among them are VfL Bochum, Arminia Bielefeld, Eintracht Frankfurt, who all missed the chance to join Bayern at the top on Saturday. Bochum lost 3-2 at Hanover, Bielefeld were thumped 3-0 at Duisburg and Frankfurt went down 2-1 at Werder Bremen. Werder and Hamburg are the other two teams on the seven-point mark. Champions VfB Stuttgart are in much worse shape, in 15th place with just four points, after they lost 1-0 away to local rivals Karlsruhe on Sunday. FRANCE Olympique Lyon, chasing a seventh consecutive title, recovered from two goals down to beat Le Mans 3-2 and move up to fifth in Ligue 1 on Saturday. Lyon were 2-0 down with 20 minutes left after midfielder Stephane Sessegnon scored twice. The home side fought back with three goals within seven minutes from France forwards Sidney Govou and Karim Benzema and Czech striker Milan Baros. Leaders Nancy, the only side still unbeaten, extended their unbeaten run with a 2-0 home victory over St Etienne courtesy of a goal in each half from Brazilian Kim and fellow forward Marc-Antoine Fortune. On Sunday, Paris St Germain were still looking for their first home win of the season after being held to a 1-1 draw by arch-rivals Olympique Marseille. NETHERLANDS Feyenoord and Vitesse Arnhem are the only two clubs with nine points from their first three games of the new Dutch season after home wins over Willem II Tilburg and NEC Nijmegen respectively. Luigi Bruins and Roy Makaay scored first half goals in a 2-0 win for a new-look Feyenoord, who are top for the first time in almost two years. Harrie Gommans' early goal earned Vitesse their 1-0 victory. Klaas Jan Huntelaar salvaged a point for third-placed Ajax Amsterdam in a 2-2 draw with Groningen, equalising in the 83rd minute. Marcus Berg had struck twice for Groningen after Luis Suarez had put Ajax ahead. PSV Eindhoven were held to goalless draw at Twente Enschede and AZ Alkmaar cruised to a 3-0 win over Excelsior Rotterdam
