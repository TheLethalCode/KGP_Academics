 ISLAMABAD, Sep 01 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was considering options on Saturday to shore up his position before trying to secure another term, as a deal with former prime minister Benazir Bhutto hung in the balance. With his term coming to an end, his popularity plummeting and challenges to his rule mounting, army chief Musharraf is trying to line up support as he prepares to seek election for another term by the national and provincial assemblies. Musharraf aims to get re-elected for another five years between mid-September and mid-October, before his term as army chief expires at the end of the year. Parliamentary elections are due to take place around the turn of the year. He has turned to Bhutto for help -- her popular Pakistan People's Party would broaden his base of support -- and has been negotiating a pact that would see him quit as army chief and Bhutto become prime minister. But many members of Musharraf's ruling Pakistan Muslim League (PML) are alarmed at the prospect of their old rival Bhutto returning from eight years of self exile to take power from them. The party is rejecting parts of the proposed deal, including the lifting of a ban on a prime minster serving a third term -- which would exclude two-time prime minister Bhutto from power. The party also objects to another Bhutto demand - that the president be stripped of the power to dismiss governments. With doubts growing about a deal with Bhutto, Musharraf is considering trying to secure the support of conservative religious parties, newspapers and a government official said. "It would be a foolish government if it had no other option in mind. They are not the only option," said Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azim Khan referring to Bhutto's party. "Obviously, there are different combinations and formations," he said, referring to a possible bloc of government support. Asked about reports the government was trying to secure the support of Fazal-ur-Rehman, the leader of an alliance of six religious parties, Aziz said: "He is one of them. We've been in contact." Bhutto has insisted an agreement would hinge on Musharraf stepping down as chief of the army, which has ruled for more than half Pakistan's history since independence in 1947. Both Bhutto and a government minister said this week Musharraf's uniform was no longer an obstacle, raising prospects that Musharraf might quit the army before his re-election. PML President Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain told The New York Times on Friday Musharraf would resign as army chief before parliamentary elections scheduled for the first week of January. But Musharraf would not risk resigning his military post before his re-election as president was assured, he said. Bhutto, who has corruption charges hanging over her, also wants immunity for officials who served in the late 1980s and 1990s. She was due to meet party colleagues in London on Saturday to decide on their stand. "It seems touch and go," Farahtullah Babar, a spokesman for Bhutto's party, said of prospects for a deal. "So far, the government has not indicated its willing to accept the terms we have offered." Bhutto has vowed to return to Pakistan soon and was making preparations in case she had to come back without an agreement and was detained, Babar said. Another looming problem for Musharraf, and Bhutto, is the return of exiled former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, the leader Musharraf overthrew in a 1999 coup. He has said he would return on Sept. 10 to challenge Musharraf. Sharif's defiance of Musharraf has raised his standing among the public, some of whom have questioned Bhutto's motives for negotiating with the unpopular president.
