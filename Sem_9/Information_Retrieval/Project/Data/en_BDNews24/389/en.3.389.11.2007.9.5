 PRISTINA, Serbia, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United Nations said on Wednesday it had no objection to a Kosovo Albanian war crimes indictee running for parliament in the province's November election.

Milosevic's forces withdrew from the southern province in June 1999 after NATO bombed for 11 weeks to halt the slaughter and ethnic cleansing of Albanian civilians.
