 BERLIN, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany has arrested three men it suspects of planning "massive bomb attacks" on US installations and belonging to a domestic cell of the Islamic Jihad militant group, German officials said on Wednesday. Federal prosecutor Monika Harms told a news conference that the men, two German nationals and one Turk, had obtained enough materials to make a bomb with an explosive power equal to 550-kilogrammes of TNT and that an attack appeared imminent.

Harms said she could not confirm reports that the accused were targeting the Frankfurt airport and US military base in Ramstein, but said they had been observed scouting out US installations such as discos, pubs, or airports.

Between February and August 2007, officials said, the accused men acquired 12 vats and a hydrogen peroxide solution used in bomb-making. Germany, which has forces stationed in Afghanistan, has been on high alert for attacks. The country has feared a re-emergence of militant Islamist groups since 2001, when the northern city of Hamburg was used as a base for planning the Sept. 11 attacks. In April the US embassy in Berlin announced it was boosting security at diplomatic and military facilities in Germany in response to an increased threat of terrorism there. Last year, two men of Lebanese origin attempted to detonate crude suitcase bombs on two trains in Germany, according to German authorities. Prosecutors have said the bombs failed to go off because of a technical err
