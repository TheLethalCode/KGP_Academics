 Dhaka, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com) - Stocks were untouched by the fallout from Khaleda Zia's arrest, finishing upbeat for the sixth-day Monday as investors continued betting on bank shares. "It appears that investors are seasoned to the political turmoil. Many investors feel the economy will take its own course," said Arif Khan, general manager of IDLC Finance. The DGEN or general index soared 43 points in one and half hours, only to lose some of its gains after midday trade, though still closed higher at the end of trading. IT stocks continued to rally along with the banking sector. Non-bank financial institutions and insurance stocks also moved up. An amendment to the Banking Companies Act 1991, which raised banks' capital requirements to Tk 2.0 billion from Tk 1.0 billion, is preserving the uptake of bank stocks. The government approved the revision last week. "Turnover has been upbeat for the last couple of days. The new capital requirement, set by the government for banks, has encouraged investors. Banking stocks now dominate the market," said Salahuddin Ahmed Khan, chief executive of the DSE. Analysts also attributed the positive trend to the entry of new investors, including businessmen who are entering the market amid limited scope for investment. An increased transaction of shares drove turnover on the Dhaka Stock Exchange to a one-month high of Tk 2.14 billion, the highest point achieved since the withdrawal of the financial netting facility. The withdrawn provision previously allowed investors to buy a new share with the proceeds of a sold share without waiting the now mandatory four days. The market regulator withdrew the facility on July 31 in an attempt to curb overheating in the stock market. The DGEN gained 11.76 points or 0.46 percent to end 2528.48. The DSI or all-share price index finished 2.72 points or 0.12 percent higher at 2114.60. The DSE-20 blue chip index edged up 8.56 points or 0.42 percent to end 2039.63. A total of 8,221,054 shares were traded. Of which 105 gained, 71 dropped and 18 held steady. Market major, Power Grid Company of Bangladesh, the mostly traded issue, ascended 2.97 percent to Tk 631. BRAC Bank dropped 0.55 percent to Tk 1115.75. AB Bank fell 1.20 percent to Tk 2358.5. National Bank dipped 3.63 percent to Tk 1275.5. Prime Bank, however, gained 2.7 percent to end Tk 759 after it clarified its position on reports of a share scam. Power generator DESCO gained, although Summit Power, Southeast Bank, Square Pharma and Pubali Bank slipped. The Chittagong Stock Exchange finished slightly lower due to profit taking in banking shares. Some 1,028,436 shares worth Tk 258.98 million were traded, 52 rose, 36 lost and nine closed unchanged. bdnews
