 Dhaka, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com) - The ministry of education has given the go-ahead to reopen all public universities, which closed due to the chaos following the student protests at Dhaka University on August 20 to 22, education adviser Aiyub Quaderi told reporters Monday. However no decision has yet been taken about when the universities will be opened, the government having requested the syndicates of the universities concerned to take their own decision in this regard after reviewing the situation. The education ministry will also take a decision regarding the opening of government university colleges and other colleges within days, said Quaderi after a meeting at the education ministry attended by ministry officials and vice chancellors of 26 universities. The ministry has informed the universities that it will provide necessary guidance to their syndicates on reopening their doors after considering their internal situation. bdnews24.c
