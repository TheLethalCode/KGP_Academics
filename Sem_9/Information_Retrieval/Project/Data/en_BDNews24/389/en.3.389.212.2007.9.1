 Dhaka, Sept 1 (bdnews24.com)The head of the judicial commission investigating the violence at Dhaka University has said he has found no evidence of any teacher instigating the incidents, in the accounts of the seven witnesses examined so far. "No information or evidence of instigation by any teacher has yet been found in the accounts of the seven witnesses whom the commission examined," said Justice Habibur Rahman Khan, head of the one-member judicial commission, Saturday. "But what will come up in future cannot be predicted," he added. The commission has taken witness statements from seven people over three working days since Tuesday: five university teachers, a student and an official of Dhaka University, he told reporters. Two Dhaka University professors Anwar Hossain and Harun-or-Rashid were picked up from their university residences on Aug 23 and detained on charges of "fuelling" campus violence. They were remanded for four more days on a second set of charges involving a breach of emergency powers rules. Speaking to reporters Saturday afternoon at the commission's office at Kakrail Circuit House, Khan said: "The student who was involved in the untoward incident [at Dhaka University] on the first day has yet to testify. The commission will take his witness account. His name and address has been sought from the pro-vice chancellor of the university." The commission head also told reporters: "Those who have been called in by the commission to give evidence so far have given their statements spontaneously. After calling them in whatever we have wanted to know from them they have told us willingly." However, the retired judge said the students had been less forthcoming. "There may be two reasons for thismay be they are afraid or they are refraining from coming here willingly." The commission chief said that witness evidence would also be taken from journalists in the interests of the investigation. "Statements will also be taken from the army personnel who were on the Dhaka University campus." However, he added that there were certain rules regarding members of the army giving evidence. Those rules will have to be taken into consideration when the army personnel are asked to give their evidence, said the retired Supreme Court judge. "So it cannot be said now when their witness statements will be taken," he added. The commission chief also said: "If we take statements from politicians and others whose names have been mentioned in different newspaper reports, saying they were involved with the incident, the scope of the commission will be stretched. So the commission is not thinking of taking questioning them now." He said: "The commission's investigation is progressing slowly. We cannot make any comment on the ongoing witness testimony." "It has not been determined how many people will need to be questioned [by the commission]. Whatever the number may be, 100 or 150, we will question every one as a witness." "Video footage will also be used for the enquiry," said Khan, adding that he will visit the site of the incident Sunday for purposes of the judicial investigation. Dhaka University's pro-vice chancellor Prof AFM Yusuf Haider gave his testimony Saturday over a two-hour stretch. Speaking to reporters afterwards, he said, "I received a phone call from the commission asking me to come to the commission's office." "The commission wanted to know about the incidents at Dhaka University on August 20 and 21. I told whatever I knew." However, replying to a question as to what he told the commission, Prof Haider said: "What I have said is now the property of the commission. I cannot make any comment on this matter." "I hope the university situation will return to normal soon," he added. "A meeting of the vice chancellors of universities will be held on September 3. After that we can say when the university will be opened." The commission has been working since Aug 28. Prof Nazmul Ahsan Kolimullah, chairman of the DU public administration department, gave evidence Tuesday, the first day of taking statements from witnesses. The second witness to testify to the commission was a student. Those who gave statements Saturday are: Prof Yusuf Haider, former vice chancellor Prof AK Azad Chowdhury, treasurer of the DU teachers association Golam Mohammad Chowdhury, former DU treasurer Prof Syed Rashidul Hasan and DU assistant registrar Sheikh Mohammd Shahnewaz. bdnews24.c
