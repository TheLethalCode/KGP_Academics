 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com) -- A Philippines congressman has filed a criminal charge against government officials over the controversial awarding of a $330 million broadband tender to Chinese telecoms equipment vendor ZTE, London-based telecomtv.com has reported Monday. Congressman Carlos Padilla has filed a criminal complaint against the country's Department of Transportation and Communication Secretary Leandro Mendoza and Assistant Secretaries Lorenzo Formoso and Elmer Soneja. Soneja is the chairman of the Bids and Awards Committee on Information and Communication. They were slapped with a complaint for violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, the Telecommunications Policy Act, Build-Operate-Transfer Law, and the Government Procurement Act. The tender is the focus of much controversy because ZTE's bid was considerably higher than rival bids that, allegedly, were not properly examined or appraised. What's more, the actual paper contract itself has mysteriously disappeared. Co-accused in the complaint are Houw Weigui and Yu Yong, chairman and vice chairman respectively of ZTE. The Chinese state-owned telecoms gear maker's chief representative in Manila George Zhu Ying and it executive director Fan Yan have been accused as well. The tender is for the provision of a broadband network connecting all government offices in the Philippines. Philippines' media has been tirelessly firing salvos at ZTE on this highly controversial $330 million deal. The Chinese vendor also took its gloves off in late July and threatened the critics with libel suits. In full-page advertisements taken in the Philippines press, ZTE says, "As a listed company in the Hong Kong and Shenzhen stock exchanges ... ZTE complies strictly not only with Chinese law, but also the local laws in all the other countries it operates ... Media reports concerning ZTE's supposed poor record or even wrongdoings in other countries ... are also totally untrue, unfounded, and even malicious." ZTE's countermeasure was primarily targeted at the Philippine Star/ABS-CBN News commentator Jarius Bondoc. He said, "Enron was a listed company as well. Bondoc has catalogued various other alleged controversies involving ZTE elsewhere in the world. These include charges brought against ZTE by the Liberian government in 2006 regarding allegations that it offered bribes to the Liberian Telecom Corporation. Bondoc has also made similar claims about allegations made against ZTE in Burma, Libya, Ecuador and Indonesia. bdn
