 KINGSTON, Sep 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jamaicans head to the polls on Monday in what is expected to be a close election as their Caribbean island heals from a brush with a monster hurricane, warily eyes another and frets over recent political violence. With voting delayed a week by Hurricane Dean's passage 15 days ago, Jamaica was under a tropical storm alert for election day as Category 5 Felix, carrying 165-mph (265 kph) winds, churned several hundred miles (km) to the southeast. Attention on the island of 2.8 million people was less on the weather than political violence after seven people were killed by gunmen on Saturday, a grim reminder of Jamaica's history of bloodshed around elections. National television broadcast pleas late on Sunday from Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller and other officials concerned about a spate of killings in a nation with one of the world's highest murder rates. "Please obey the law to the letter. Do not allow yourself to be provoked into anger," Simpson Miller said. "To anyone who might have violent intentions, I say think again. ... I encourage you to put down your weapons of war. Discover the joy and peace of having clean hands, a clean heart and a clear conscience." Simpson Miller's People's National Party sought a record fifth consecutive five-year term but the latest polls showed the opposition Jamaica Labour Party surging. A poll published in the Jamaica Observer newspaper on Sunday had the JLP ahead by 9 percentage points, while an analysis by the Sunday Gleaner had the JLP winning at least 32 of the 60 parliamentary seats at stake. About 1.3 million Jamaicans are eligible to vote. Both parties have new leaders since the last election in 2002. Simpson Miller replaced longtime Prime Minister P.J. Patterson, while veteran politician Bruce Golding took over the JLP when Edward Seaga, a former prime minister, stepped down as party leader after three decades. Golding has played on Jamaica's high unemployment rate of 9 percent, slow economic growth of between 2 and 2.5 percent over the past five years, and a murder rate averaging 1,200 per year, to forge gains in the polls. Police blamed Saturday's killings on Jamaica's highly partisan politics, which gave birth decades ago to "garrison" communities, a unique system of power and intimidation. The garrisons were created in the 1970s when the two major parties armed local political bosses, who through threats, intimidation and patronage delivered 100 percent of a neighborhood's vote to the sponsoring party. Dissenters were driven from their homes and supporters moved in, creating vote-rich party strongholds. RECOVERING FROM DEAN Parts of the verdant, mountainous island remained without electricity after Dean ravaged the island on August 19, killing five people, tearing apart coastal homes and destroying 90 percent of the banana crop. Albert Ramdin, head of the Organization of American States' election observer mission, said elections officials had restored most of the hurricane-damaged polling stations and relocated nine that could not be repaired in time. He lauded preparations for Jamaica's 15th election since voting began in 1944, but said he was concerned about the negative tone of the campaign. Jamaica's history of election violence reached its peak in 1980, when nearly 900 people were killed. Recent elections have been more peaceful. "While we see an increase in violence over the past couple of days ... I don't think it was widespread," Ramdin said. "I think that the law enforcement agencies are prepared." bd
