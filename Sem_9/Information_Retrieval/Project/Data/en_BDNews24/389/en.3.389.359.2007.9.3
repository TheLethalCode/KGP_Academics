<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com)  The police arrested Khaleda Zia and her son Arafat Rahman Coco at their cantonment home early Monday, security officials said. She was arrested shortly after 7:30am along with Coco. The embattled former prime minister and her son were led away at 7:39am, in a security bubble. The move came hours after the Anticorruption Commission filed a corruption case against 13 people, including the former prime minister and the younger son. Police and RAB officers and intelligence agents swarmed the road to the Shaheed Mainul Road residence of the BNP chief. Khaleda will be taken to the court of metropolitan magistrate Md Salehuddin. Security officers put in place a huge security arrangement on the road to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka. In an exclusive phone interview with bdnews24.com a couple of hour before the arrest, Khaleda said: "I'm not afraid of arrest. People are with me. The case against me is false." Khaleda faces allegations of having a role in shady appointment of a private handling company, Global Agro Trade Company as a contractor for the Inland Container Depot in Kamalapur and Chittagong Port Container Terminal. The ACC alleged that Khaleda used her influence illegally as prime minister in the appointment of the contractor. In the build-up to the arrest, scores of security officers in plainclothes drove into Dhaka cantonment before dawn, as the arrest of the BNP chairperson loomed in the horizon. Plainclothes officers arrived at the house at around 5:15am and asked Khaleda and Coco to "get ready" in a clear indication of arrest, house staffer Ruhul Amin told bdnews24.com at 5:40am. At least 10 cars in the first batch drove into the cantonment shortly after 5am, followed by another convoy of up to 25 cars, witnesses reported from the scene. In the rare interview with bdnews24.com, Khaleda said: "Against the BNP, there was a conspiracy in the past. Still there is. I hope BNP leaders and workers stay united." "I worked for people all my life. I'm passing the burden of justice to people as well. Please pray for me," Khaleda told bdnews24.com by phone from home. bdnew
