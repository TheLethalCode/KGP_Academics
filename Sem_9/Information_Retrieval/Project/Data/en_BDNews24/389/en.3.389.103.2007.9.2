 NAHR AL-BARED, Lebanon, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The number of militants killed on Sunday in a battle with the Lebanese army near a Palestinian refugee camp in north Lebanon climbed to 31, security sources said. The fighting came after more than three months of clashes between the army and the Fatah al-Islam militants in Nahr el-Bared camp. The militants had tried to flee the camp. Previously, a security source said, Twenty Islamist militants and two Lebanese soldiers were killed in a battle on Sunday near a Palestinian refugee camp in north Lebanon. The Fatah al-Islam militants had been attempting to flee the Nahr al-Bared camp, where they have been battling the army for more than three months in Lebanon's worst internal violence since the 1975-1990 civil war, security sources said. An army statement said the al Qaeda-inspired militants had staged a "desperate attempt to flee" the camp, which has been reduced to rubble by the battle. The fighting, which erupted on May 20, has killed more than 300, including at least 154 soldiers, 120 militants and 42 civilians. Most of the camp's 40,000 residents fled in the early days of the battle to a nearby Palestinian refugee camp.
