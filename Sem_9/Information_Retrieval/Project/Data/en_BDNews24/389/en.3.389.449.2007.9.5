 OSLO, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Norwegian politicians from both the ruling centre left and conservative right opposition have called for regulations to take non-Norwegian beggars off the streets. A week before Norway holds local elections, the traditional political rivals united on the issue to arrest what they see as a "dramatic" increase in foreigners asking for crowns in Norwegian cities since begging was decriminalised in 2006. "Norway cannot become a haven for international begging," Conservative Oslo city council leader Erling Lae told newspaper Dagsavisen. Centre-left Labour Party candidate for Oslo mayor Rune Gerhardsen said that most foreign beggars were in Norway on a tourist visa, which made it illegal for them to be involved in "business activities", a term he said included begging. Only the far-left Socialists defended foreign beggars, saying it saw "no aggressive begging" in Oslo and that moving such people would not solve their poverty problems. Norway, rich from oil, has had an influx of immigrants from poorer East European, North African or Asian states.
