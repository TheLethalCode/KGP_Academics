 BAGHDAD, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A bomb killed 11 people and wounded 23 in a Shia neighbourhood of the Iraqi capital Baghdad on Wednesday, hospital sources said. The attack in Sadr City was one of the deadliest in Baghdad in weeks, following a reduction in violent incidents across the country that US commanders attribute to a troop build-up ordered by US President George W. Bush earlier this year. Iraqi police said the bomb exploded at a square where minibuses gather to pick up and drop off passengers. At least five buses were set on fire. One police source put the death toll at nine, with 21 wounded. Sadr City is a stronghold of the Mehdi Army militia of fiery Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. Bush, on an unannounced visit to Iraq on Monday, said security had improved in Iraq and raised the prospect of US troop cuts if the trend continued.
