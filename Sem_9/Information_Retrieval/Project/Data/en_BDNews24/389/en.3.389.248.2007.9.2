<TITLE> Grameen Bank's Village Phone loses shine: study </TITLE>

 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com)  Grameen Bank's poverty-reduction initiative by renting mobile phone out to rural borrowers is increasingly becoming unviable, a recent study said. "Grameen's famous Village Phone Programme lifted thousands out of povertyand helped Muhammad Yunus win the Nobel Peace Prize. The problem: It's not working anymore," said New York-based technology and economic writer Richard Shaffer. His reportUnplanned Obsolescencehas been published in the September issue of monthly "First Company". It said mounting competition has resulted in continuous decline in tariff and subscription costs. Handsets have also become affordable and widely available nationwide. Such factors have contributed to the exploding growth of mobile phones in Bangladesh. "As a result, may who needed to use someone else's phone can afford one of their own," Shaffer said, calling it the major cause of declining profitability of Village Phone scheme. Yunus founded Grameen Telecom in 1996 as a "not for profit company" that now owns 38 percent of Grameenphone. His idea of Village Phone was to provide mobile phone services to the poor in rural Bangladesh. Grameen Bank's female micro-credit borrowers acquire post-paid connections with mobile phones under lease-financing microcredit program. They provide telephone services to the people nearby and payback the mortgage to Grameen Bank. Such women are called the VP operators. There were only 32 VP operators when Grameen Bank, in conjunction with Grameen Telecom, launched the programme in 1997. Shaffer said advances in digital electronics have helped to lower the price of a cellular handset in poor nations from more than $400 to about $30. "In practical terms, that's a reduction from more than the national average annual wage in those countries to less than the wages for a single month," he noted. Bangladesh's mobile market registered 135 percent growth in 2006. With 21.76 million subscribers, the country also secured second position among the world's top 10 emerging markets in terms of annual growth. The VP operators also grew to 278,027 in 2006. But at the same time, the rural people's dependence also reduced on Grameen Bank borrowers' mobile phone service. Shaffer said it was widely believed that a village phone operator could annually make between $750 and $1,200. "The current reality, however, is something different. Profits per operator have been declining for years and in 2006 averaged less than $70," a Grameen Telecom official told the American researcher. Shaffer has reviewed the village phone business of Begum, a Grameen Bank borrower. Ten years ago she was the only phone provider in her village of 10,000 people. Now Begum struggles with stiff competition from 284 similar operators nearby. Her neighbours have also bought mobile phones as the prices have come down. As a result, Begum's phone rentals these days bring in monthly profits of only $22. "Today, poor women who go into the phone business stay poor," Grameen Bank loan officer Salim Khan who handles Begum's account admitted to Shaffer. As a result, Grameen Bank's microcredit ventures through the Village Phone scheme became less feasible, the study remarks. "The program is not dead but it is no longer a way out of poverty," Grameen Telecom's technical chief Mazharul Hannan disclosed to Shaffer. Grameen Bank is expanding the Village Phone concept beyond Bangladesh. Pilot programs are underway or being considered in Cambodia, Cameroon, Senegal, Mali, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The Grameen Foundation, on whose board Muhammad Yunus sits, has reproduced the programme in Uganda and Rwanda, and is encouraging microfinance institutions elsewhere to clone more. But Shaffer calls the expansion effort "disingenuous". Yunus proclaims, "If a poor woman gets hold of one mobile phone in the village, then this is a sure bet that her entire family can move out of poverty in two or three years." Shaffer said: "In some indigent backwaters that may still be true. But it's misleading, at best, to pretend that Bangladesh is among them." "The hypothesis of alleviating poverty through mobile phone has been proven wrong," Grameen Bank's former deputy managing director M Khalid Shams told bdnews24.com. The long-time comrade of Yunus and number-two in Grameen Bank had also headed Grameen Telecom for three years until he had resigned recently for undisclosed reasons. Shams also echoed Shaffer while pointing the reason behind Village Phone's reduced relevance. "It was feasible when there was shortage of phone but now the service is widely available and that's why Village Phone is not that profitable," he said. bdnews
