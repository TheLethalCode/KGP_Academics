<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 1 (bdnews24.com)  The interim government Saturday set office timings for government, semi-government, autonomous and semi-autonomous organisations from 9am to 3:30pm for the Ramadan. There will be a break from 1:15pm to 1:30pm for prayers, according to a decision, taken by the council of advisers at a meeting at the Chief Adviser's Office. The decision will not apply to organisations engaged in emergency services, including banks, post offices, telephone offices, railway, hospitals and state-owned factories. The organisations will fix their own Ramadan timings, considering public interest. The Supreme Court and the courts under it would fix their office timings individually. The meeting of the council of advisers, chaired by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed, also approved a proposal to ratify an agreement regarding establishment of South Asian University for the spread of higher education in Asia. The decision to establish the university was taken in principle at the 13th Saarc summit in Dhaka in 2005. The foreign ministers of Saarc countries signed an agreement for establishing the university during the Saarc summit in New Delhi in April. The meeting discussed making effective the Bangladesh Television Authorities Act 2001. The information ministry was directed to present the Act at a cabinet meeting after further review of it. A presentation was made at the meeting on behalf of the agriculture ministry on new technology and methods of applying fertiliser to increase output of crops and make the use of fertiliser cost-effective to farmers. bdnew
