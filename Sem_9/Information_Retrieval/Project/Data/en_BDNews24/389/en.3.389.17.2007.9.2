 Dhaka, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com)Law and information adviser Mainul Hosein in a bid to avoid the recent debate over how to define the present administration has said an honest, fair and democratic government must be ensured through election. "Call this government what you will...a rose is a rose by any name!" Mainul said Sunday. Mainul was referring to a recent indirect exchange of remarks with the army chief, General Moeen U Ahmed, who had stressed that the current government was a 'caretaker government', in response to a previous comment by Mainul that it was an 'army backed, national government'. "Of course we are a caretaker government by constitution," said the adviser. "We are trying to carry out responsibilities important for the nation. It's up to you about how you define it," he said. The adviser added that the current caretaker government has specific goals. "The nation must not fail to achieve them. We need to work honestly and collectively. This is a great opportunity making a fresh start," Mainul told reporters, after a seminar by the Bangladesh Women Chamber of Commerce and Industry at CIRDAP. The BWCCI organised the seminar to launch a project on Promoting Women Entrepreneurs Through Advocacy. Entrepreneurs at the meeting blamed long-term policies of previous governments for the lack of the development of women entrepreneurship. The adviser, stressing the need for good governance, said: "We want to set some examples to establish good governance. Women entrepreneurs will be benefited if we can ensure good governance," he said. Mainul said women should be treated as human resources rather than unimportant to development, as no nation was able to attain its progress by ignoring women's potential. "The government has no long term policy for the development of women entrepreneurship. We request the government to frame a proper policy for us," said president of BWCCI Selima Ahmad. Selima also demanded budgetary support for proper investment in women entrepreneurs, saying governments treat women as 'destitute and poor' when it only allocates poverty alleviation funds for women. bdn
