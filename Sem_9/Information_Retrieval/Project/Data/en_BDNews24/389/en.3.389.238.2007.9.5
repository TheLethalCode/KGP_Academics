 Dhaka, Sept 05 (bdnews24.com)Iajuddin Ahmed Wednesday expressed his gratitude Wednesday for his five-year tenure as president. But Iajuddin will continue as president until the election of his successor in line with the constitution. In a statement released to the media, he thanked the government and people for their constant cooperation. "Democracy has a very important role in building a prosperous country," he said. "The democratic institutions should be strengthened along with bringing accountability and transparency at every level to ensure a meaningful democratic environment," he said. Iajuddin was installed as president on Sept 5, 2002, after the exit of president AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury. Though his five-year tenure ended Wednesday, law and information adviser Mainul Hosein announced Tuesday that Iajuddin's term would be extended in line with the constitution, which spells out clearly that the president "shall continue to hold office until his successor enters upon his office". Iajuddin will therefore continue until the next parliament session begins. Earlier on Wednesday, Iajuddin said polls would be held in line with the roadmap of the Election Commission and voter registration was accordingly underway. The president made the remark while visiting 'Operation Nabajatra' voter enlistment with photographs and national ID card project in Savar municipality. "The work for voter registration is going on smoothly but it cannot be credible until one sees with one's own eyes." He thanked the army personnel for assisting in the preparation of the voter list. Iajuddin arrived at Savar College voter registration centre at around 11am. He talked to people who had come to register as voters. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda was with him. bdnews2
