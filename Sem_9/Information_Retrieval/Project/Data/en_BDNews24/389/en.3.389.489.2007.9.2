 Dhaka, Sept 1 (bdnews24.com) - The Awami League's acting president Zillur Rahman Saturday openly differed with AL presidium member Amir Hossain Amu's assessment that the party can go to the polls without Sheikh Hasina. Zillur told reporters gathered at his Gulshan home: "How can we go to the polls with our leader in detention, it cannot happen." Since returning from Singapore Wednesday Amir Hossain Amu has made several statements on the possibility of holding an election without Hasina, a party council and talks with the Election Commission. Zillur said: "He [Amu] has been abroad. There is an information gap. I am telling you what the party's official position is." "I talked with almost all party members, and if the ban on indoor politics is not withdrawn we will not go for any discussions. This is the party's stand." Zillur said: "Amir Hossain Amu should have held discussions within the party instead of going to the media. The party has decided not to hold a party council without Sheikh Hasina." Earlier, Khandaker Moniruzzaman, a tax lawyer for Hasina, quoted her as saying that she would rely on Zillur for any decision on reform talks with the Election Commission. "Sheikh Hasina said Zillur Rahman would lead the way in making a decision at a meeting of the Awami League Central Working Committee on reform talks with the EC," the lawyer told reporters after visiting the former prime minister detained in the special jail. Amu told reporters Saturday that Hasina should bear in mind that she assumed the Awami League leadership as the daughter of Bangabandhu. The two Awami League leaders have met since their difference of opinion came to light. Zillur said: "I tried to explain to him that the decision to reject discussions with the Election Commission was not my decision alone. It was a decision taken after a collective discussion." "Following this decision, all parties including the BNP and Jamaat have said they will not hold discussions with the Election Commission either. At least until the ban on indoor politics is lifted." "We are waiting for a letter in this regard from the Election Commission. We will not rush into anything." "We have to see what form the letter takes. We will make a decision following a formal discussion," he said. Amu previously said the Awami League would support the current caretaker government in accordance with decisions made at the last working committee meeting. In response to this, Zillur said: "We will support any good work the government does and reject anything which is bad." bdnews24.com/sum/
