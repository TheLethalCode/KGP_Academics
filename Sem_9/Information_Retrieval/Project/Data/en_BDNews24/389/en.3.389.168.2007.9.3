<TITLE> Australian state bans toxic Chinese toothpaste </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MELBOURNE, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Australian state has banned imports of three brands of Chinese toothpaste, saying they contain potentially lethal levels of a toxic chemical. The recall by Victoria state is the latest warning about Chinese-made imports that has raised international concerns about the quality of goods from toys to pet food, tyres and seafood. The Victorian state government said the toothpaste contained a chemical called DEG (diethylene glycol) that is classified as a "toxic substance". It said it will fine retailers upto A$61,350 if they are found to be selling the brands. Diethylene glycol is an industrial solvent used in paint and antifreeze and can cause kidney and liver damage. China is Australia's biggest trading partner and this week President Hu Jintao will be Sydney for an Asia-Pacific summit where he is expected to defend the "made-in-China" label. Chinese officials have described the spate of product recalls of Chinese-made goods as unfair and biased, saying it exposed a protectionist agenda. The toothpaste brands, Tri Leaf Spearmint, Cool Mate and Hei, contain up to 16 percent DEG, compared with an acceptable level of 0.25 percent, the Victoria Department of Consumer Affairs said on its Web site. "The toothpaste containing more than 0.25 percent by weight of DEG...may cause death or serious injury," it said. New Zealand last week asked retailers and consumers to dispose of 11 brands of Chinese-made toothpaste after tests confirmed they contained DEG. The chemical is similar to but much cheaper than glycerine, which is widely used as a syrup in medicines and toothpaste. Panama says at least 100 people died after taking cough syrup that contained DEG rather than glycerine. In July, China banned the use of DEG in toothpaste following a recall of Chinese-made products across the globe, including the United States, Spain, Singapore, Panama and several other countries. bd
