 DHAKA, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bangladesh all-rounder Saqibul Hasan is a doubt for the Twenty20 World Cup due to an injured finger, a cricket official on Sunday. Bangladesh face hosts South Africa and West Indies in the group stage of the 12-team championship to be played from Sept. 11-24. Saqibul damaged his right index finger last week during a practice session in Nairobi, where Bangladesh are now playing in a four-nation warm-up tournament. "The finger is in under a protective cap at present. The team physio will monitor his position in three to four days," Bangladesh media manager Rabeed Imam told Reuters from Nairobi. A middle-order batsman/left-arm spinner, Saqibul has played three tests and 34 ODIs for Bangladesh since making his debut against Zimbabwe at home last year. He has been short-listed for the ICC emerging player of the year award, which will be given in Johannesburg on Sept. 10
