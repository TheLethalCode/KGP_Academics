 Dhaka, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com) - BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia has expelled secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan and joint secretary general Ashraf Hossain from the party, according to a letter released to the media Monday. Khandaker Delwar Hossain replaces Bhuiyan and will work as the acting secretary general. Delwar will be assisted by two senior BNP leadersASM Hannan Shah and Gayeshwar Chandra Roy. Khaleda wrote the notification letter about her decision to Mannan Bhuiyan, Ashraf Hossain and Delwar Hossain on Sunday prior to her arrest on Monday. However she had announced she announced Bhuiyan's expulsion to reporters Monday morning as she was leaving the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court, to be detained in special jail following her arrest earlier on charges of corruption. In her letter Khaleda said that amid the emergency and the ban on politics, Mannan Bhuiyan had held meetings with the so-called 'reformists', formed various personal opinions on party reforms and internal matters of the party, which he had then shared with the media without the approval of the council, standing committee and the chairperson. Khaleda claimed such actions were aimed at splitting the party and opposed to the discipline, constitution, interests and regulations of the party. For these reasons, as per the party constitution 5 (GA) and 8 (KHA) regarding party interests and party discipline, she was expelling Mannan Bhuiyan from the post of secretary general and from the party, Khaleda said. After the imposition of the state of emergency Mannan Bhuiyan and Ashraf Hossain both spoke out on party'reforms', while Hannan Shah spoke on Khaleda Zia's behalf against the 'reformists'. On August 1, in a teleconference with Chandpur Chhatra Dal, Khaleda Zia had alleged that Mannan Bhuiyan was involved in the intrigue to split the party. "Mannan Bhuiyan does not have faith in religion, his life style does not match with the ideology of BNP. He has become involved with a group in breaching the party," she had said. She expressed the same views in other teleconferences in the country and abroad. On August 5, she said she would take steps against those who were involved in splitting the party. bdnews24.com
