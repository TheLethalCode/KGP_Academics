 LONDON, Sept 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A local track inspector cut short his patrol and failed to check damaged points which derailed an express at nearly 100 mph (160 kph) in remote countryside, UK infrastructure firm Network Rail said on Tuesday. The crash at Grayrigg in northern England killed an elderly woman passenger. Five other people were seriously injured. Chief Executive Iain Coucher said there had been a breakdown in the relationship between track patrollers and their supervisors in the area. "There was some animosity there between people," said infrastructure director Peter Henderson. "It was at a personal level in a number of respects." The state-of-the-art Virgin Pendolino tilting train from London to Glasgow jumped the rail at 94 mph on Feb. 23, scattering carriages down the side of a steep embankment. An inspection on Feb. 18 ended short of the points that caused the crash. Two of the four spacer bars on the points were broken and the other two were missing, Network Rail said. Network rail said all 120 sets of points in Britain similar to those at Grayrigg were having their stretcher bars replaced. The work would be completed by the end of October. The Grayrigg incident was similar to the Potters Bar derailment in May 2002, which was caused by a points failure and killed 7 passengers. The worst UK accident to occur in recent years happened in 1999 when two trains collided near the capital's Paddington station, killing 31 people. "The patroller finished shorter than he should," said Coucher. "We don't know why he finished short," he added, but declined to give further details to avoid prejudicing an ongoing investigation by the British Transport Police. "The underyling causes were deficiencies in the supervision and assurance regime in the Lancashire and Cumbria area, which resulted in the deterioration not being picked up," said Couch
