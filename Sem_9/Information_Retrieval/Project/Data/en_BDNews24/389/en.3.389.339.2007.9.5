 DURBAN, South Africa, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pace bowler Andre Nel will replace injured batsman Loots Bosman in South Africa's squad for the ICC World Twenty20 tournament, Cricket South Africa (CSA) said on Tuesday. Bosman was ruled out after injuring his back as he dived into the advertising boards during South Africa's tour to Zimbabwe last month. Selection convenor Joubert Strydom said the patchy performance of South Africa's attack against Zimbabwe had led to the decision to replace a batsman with a bowler. "The T20 squad was selected before the tour of Zimbabwe and, as most critics have mentioned, the bowling department looked a bit under-done and we feel that this is the area of the team that needed to be strengthened," Strydom was quoted as saying in a CSA media release. "We are well stocked in the top three batting department with five players - Graeme Smith, Herschelle Gibbs, AB de Villiers, Goolam Bodi and JP Duminy - all technically equipped to deal with the new ball and having the expansive strokeplay to force the pace where necessary." Twelve teams will contest the inaugural 20-over world championships in South Africa from Sept. 11 to 24
