 Cox's Bazar, Sept 4 (bdnews24.com) - RAB director general Hasan Mahmud Khandaker Tuesday said that the government had given the battalion arms to use, and they would be used, if necessary. Whether the arms were used lawfully remains to be seen, he told reporters after inaugurating a three-day seminar on "Human Rights under the Police Reform Programme at Hotel Sea Palace in Cox's Bazar Tuesday. Denying allegations of human-rights violations during RAB operations, Hasan Mahmud said: "If any RAB member uses arms illegally, action will surely be taken against him." On the demand to set up a RAB unit in Cox's Bazar, he said: "Any specialised force has a fewer number of members, its work area is also smaller. As a result, the force cannot work everywhere. However, the issue of setting up a RAB unit in the tourism town of Cox's Bazar will be considered." The RAB has over 9,700 members in 12 battalions. Fifteen RAB officers, including two women, of director and assistant-director levels are participating in the seminar. bdnews2
