<TEXT>
 BAGHDAD, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr's office on Sunday demanded the Iraqi government conduct a fair investigation into clashes in the city of Kerbala last week, warning of unspecified "decisions" if it did not. The comments raise questions about the powerful movement's commitment to an order from Sadr to suspend armed action by his feared Mehdi Army militia for up to six months in the wake of the violence. Shi'ite Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki told a news conference he had set up an independent committee to probe the clashes.

Maliki has blamed "outlawed armed criminal gangs from the remnants of the buried Saddam regime" for the violence. His office late last week said the Sadr movement was "considered one of basic political blocs in Iraq and will remain an active and a real partner in the political process". The Sadrist statement called that comment "just ink on a pen". Arrests and raids by American forces were continuing, the Sadr office statement added. The US military on Saturday welcomed the suspension order and said it hoped security forces could now focus more on fighting Sunni Islamist al Qaeda. Sadr's aides have said the order was designed to allow Sadr to weed out rogue elements from the milit
