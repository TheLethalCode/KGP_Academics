<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com) -- Stocks finished higher Wednesday amid buying pressure from investors after the shares of five companies in the power and the banking sector started trading on the public market instead of the spot market. The issues are: AB Bank, DESCO, BRAC Bank, Power Grid Company of Bangladesh and Summit Power. The Securities and Exchange Commission on Sept 3 withdrew trading of the issues on the public market. The regulator in July directed the trading of the shares on the spot market to rein in overheating of their prices. The market went up in the morning spell but fell sharply within half an hour on profit-taking only to regain pace prior to midday and traded flat until closing. Power Grid and BRAC Bank led the upbeat trend. Bank and power stock finished mixed amid profit taking. But life insurance and IT sector continued rallying. Cement and non- bank financial issues also gained. The DGEN or general index closed at 2540.97, up 12.49 points or 0.349 percent. The DSI or all-share price index ascended 4.72 points or o.22 percent to 2119.33. The DSE-20 blue chip index ended almost flat adding 1.77 points or 0.08 percent to 2041.40. A total of 1,03,40,883 shares worth Tk 2.09 billion were traded. Gainers ruled losers 130 to 59. Some 21 issues held steady. All the indices except CSE-30 index on the Chittagong Stock Exchange moved up. Turnover on the bourse stood at Tk 253.92 million against the transaction of 13,09,060 shares. Some 66 shares gained, 38 lost and eight remained stable. Market major Power Grid Company of Bangladesh rallied 5.26 percent to finish at an all time high of Tk 664.25.
