 EL FASHER, Sudan, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon arrived in the Darfur region of western Sudan on Wednesday, promising to step up pressure for a political solution to the festering conflict. Ban told journalists he would push for progress in peace talks between the Sudanese government and rebel groups, while laying the ground for deployment of a 26,000-strong "hybrid" force of UN and African Union peacekeepers. "I am really going to step up this political negotiation process," Ban said just before arriving in El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur state. "The hybrid troop process should be accompanied by a political process. Otherwise our peacekeepers or police or civilian workers will have a lot of difficulty in carrying out their roles," he said. He added there had been some progress in organising peace talks with Darfur's splintered rebel groups. "As far as the political negotiation process and coordination, we are coming close to agreeing on a venue and a date. I hope I will be able to finalise negotiations very soon." International experts estimate some 200,000 people have died and 2.5 million have been driven from their homes during 4-1/2 years of fighting in Darfur. Sudan puts the death toll from the conflict, which flared when rebel groups took up arms against the government, charging it with neglect, at 9,000. Ban was greeted at the airport by officials and a small group of women carrying banners urging rebel groups who refuse to sign up to last year's troubled Darfur Peace Agreement to attend the coming negotiations. These are widely expected to be held in October. A senior U.N. official travelling with Ban said there had been progress in finalising arrangements to fly a sick Darfur rebel out of Sudan to receive medical treatment in Kenya. Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir gave Ban a pledge on Monday that the rebel official, Suleiman Jamous, would be able to leave effective house arrest as soon as arrangements could be made. "He has a new passport and we are in the process of getting him a Kenyan visa," said the official. Late on Tuesday, Sudanese state media reported that Bashir had appointed his close advisor Nafie Ali Nafie as the government's new chief negotiator for Darfur. Nafie Ali Nafie replaces the formidable Dr Majzoub al-Khalifa, who died in a car crash on the way to a family funeral in June. The international aid group Oxfam on Wednesday called on Ban to press the Sudanese government for an immediate ceasefire in Darfur. Mohammed Elmi, Oxfam's Regional Programme Manager, said: "One month after a UN Resolution called for an immediate cessation of hostilities, its demands are falling on deaf ears. "If his visit is to be a success, the secretary-general must send an unequivocal message to those responsible that the violence and lawlessness in Darfur must end immediately." Last week, Ban sketched out a three-point approach to Darfur: deployment of the 26,000 UN and African Union troops and police, approved by the Security Council in July, peace talks tentatively scheduled for October, and aid. But these came against a background of reports of renewed conflict in the regi
