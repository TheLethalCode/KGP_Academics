 BASRA, Iraq, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British troops quit the southern Iraqi city of Basra on Monday, an Iraqi general said, ending the British presence in the oil hub for the first time since the US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003. The pullout from their base at Basra Palace, which was built for Saddam, is another step towards handing over Basra province to Iraqi control and paving the way for an eventual withdrawal of British forces from Iraq. "At 4:30 this morning the British forces completed their withdrawal from the presidency palace and the Iraqi army took responsibility for protecting the palace," Major-General Mohan al-Firaiji, commander of Iraqi security operations in Basra, told reporters. A British military spokesman in Basra said he could not comment until operations were complete. The soldiers are moving to a vast British airbase on the outskirts of Basra. Residents said they saw armoured vehicles leaving the palace in the early hours of Monday. Helicopters also took off and landed during the night. On Monday, Iraqi soldiers were on guard outside the main gate into the palace. In a statement, the British Ministry of Defence said handing over the palace "has long been our intention". It said British forces would retain overall security responsibility for Basra until the handover to provincial Iraqi control, expected towards the end of the year. The withdrawal from the palace comes a week before US President George W. Bush's top officials in Iraq present pivotal reports to Congress on the country's security and political situation. The testimony on Sept. 10 by US commander, General David Petraeus, and Ambassador Ryan Crocker, could influence future White House policy on the more than four-year-old war. The pullout also comes amid bitter recriminations between former US and British generals over the Iraq conflict. Britain's foreign and defence ministers published an editorial in a US newspaper last week defending Britain's role in the face of suggestions in US media that British forces had failed in Basra and were set to flee. The British forces reject criticism, by military analysts and some anonymous US officials, that they have allowed Iraq's gateway to the Gulf to fall into the hands of Shi'ite militias and their withdrawal from Basra Palace signals their defeat. TURF WAR Basra has witnessed a turf war between rival Shi'ite groups, including supporters of fiery cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, the Supreme Iraqi Islamic Council and smaller Fadhila party, mainly for political supremacy and control of illegal oil traffic. While residents say there is now a fragile calm between the groups, there are fears the British withdrawal will be accompanied by an upsurge in factional violence. Some 500 troops had been based at the palace, which was bombarded daily by mortar and rocket fire. The withdrawal from the palace will lead to the reduction in the number of British soldiers in Iraq to about 5,000. All are based at the airbase, which is also attacked daily. The British Ministry of Defence said that British troops would continue to train and support Iraqi security forces there. Britain has already handed over three other provinces in southern Iraq to Iraqi authorities amid a surge in attacks that have claimed the lives of 41 British soldiers this year -- the highest number of casualties suffered by the British since the first year of the war. A riverside university city of more than 1 million people, Iraq's second city is strategically vital as the hub of southern oil fields that produce nearly all of the government's revenue, and the centre for imports and exports through the Gulf.
