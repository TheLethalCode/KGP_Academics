<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia spends her first day in special jail Monday after security forces arrested the former prime minister early morning. Khaleda now joins her bitter rival Sheikh Hasina and many more senior political figures behind bars. The arrest of Khaleda has been seemingly awaited by those who began to think that the emergency government was letting Khaleda off the hook, while going after Hasina. However, law and information adviser Mainul Hosein Monday afternoon said just hours after the arrest that Khaleda's detention was not a means to maintain 'political balance.' Khaleda is being kept in a first floor room in a house, on the Sangsad Bhaban complex, that is situated just 70 yards from another makeshift prison where former prime minister Sheikh Hasina has been detained since July 16, say jail authorities. The former prime minister was driven to the special jail at 10:15am, after a Dhaka court refused her bail plea in the corruption case filed against Khaleda, her son and 11 others by the Anticorruption Commission Sunday night. Khaleda faces allegations of playing a role in the dubious selection of a private handling company, Global Agro Trade Company, as a contractor for the Inland Container Depot in Kamalapur and Chittagong Port Container Terminal. The ACC has alleged that Khaleda used her influence illegally as prime minister in the selection of the contractor. The court of metropolitan magistrate ABM Abdul Fattah also ordered seven days' remand for the BNP chief's younger son Arafat Rahman Coco, who was arrested along with her shortly after 7:30am. Security officials battled chaos in front of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka, as the embattled former prime minister arrived wearing sari and sunglasses in a Nissan Patrol car amid a tight security bubble. Coco was in a different car. In the build-up to the arrest, scores of security officers in plainclothes drove into Dhaka cantonment before dawnpolice and RAB officers and intelligence agents swarmed the road to the Shaheed Mainul Road residence of the BNP chief. . In an exclusive phone interview with bdnews24.com a couple of hours before the arrest, Khaleda said: "I'm not afraid of arrest. People are with me. The case against me is false." Plainclothes officers arrived at the house at around 5:15am and asked Khaleda and Coco to "get ready" in a clear indication of arrest, house staffer Ruhul Amin told bdnews24.com at 5:40am. At least 10 cars in the first batch drove into the cantonment shortly after 5am, followed by another convoy of up to 25 cars, witnesses reported from the scene. In the rare interview with bdnews24.com, Khaleda said: "Against the BNP, there was a conspiracy in the past. There still is. I hope BNP leaders and workers stay united." "I worked for people all my life. I'm passing the burden of justice to people as well. Please pray for me," Khaleda told bdnews24.com by phone from home. The lawyers who defended Khaleda and her son in court were Abdul Wadud Bhuiyan, Sanaullah Miah, Masud Ahmed Talukder, Lutfe Alam and Khorshed Alam. Prosecution officer Abdur Rashid represented the ACC in court. bdnews24.
