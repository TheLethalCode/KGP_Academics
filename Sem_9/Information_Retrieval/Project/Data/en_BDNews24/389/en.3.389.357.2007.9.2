 MOSCOW, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday set Dec. 2 as the date for parliamentary elections, seen as a dress rehearsal for the 2008 presidential vote. Opinion polls indicate the parliamentary vote will again give Kremlin loyalists a big majority in the State Duma, the lower house which has rubber-stamped most of Putin's decisions during his seven-year rule.
