<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 1 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League presidium member Amir Hossain Amu said Saturday the party would give Sheikh Hasina something more attractive if she left the party chief's post willingly. "Sheikh Hasina must keep in mind that she had become the party president only because she is the daughter of Bangabandhu," Amu told reporters at his Eskaton home in the city. On if he is going to take over the post of the party's acting chief, Amu said he had full support to the leadership of Zillur Rahman. On whether the party's leadership would be changed if the next elections are held amid Hasina's detention, he said: "There's no decision to change the party leadership." If the so-called minus-2 formula falls on Hasina, what will happen then? Amu replied: "I don't know what the minus-2 formula means." "If Bangabandhu was not the party president (during his time) he had nothing to lose. Sheikh Hasina is the daughter of Bangabandhu. This is her biggest identity." If her main identity is that she is the daughter of Bangabandhu, do you mean that she has no leadership quality? Amu said: "I am not here to make a judgment. But she had earlier led the party with competence." About the party's discussion on electoral reforms with the Election Commission, Amu said they would take a decision at the party forum after getting an invitation from the commission. He said he would not differ on the party's decision. "There's no division among us. Why do you (journalists) say that always? Only when somebody leaves the party differing on the party decision, it can be called a division." On Hasina's observation that the military-backed interim government is playing double standards in dealing with the two major parties, and there are no strong charges against BNP chief Khaleda Zia, Amu said: "I won't interpret it this way." "I demand that the government implement its pledges that it will try the people of the previous (BNP-led coalition) government, who were involved in corruption or repressed women." Reports are there that some old cases are being revived against Hasina. Do you think it is going to happen to put further pressure on Hasina? "I think the cases should be tried in line with the law of that time when the cases had been filed." The former food minister does not think that the Awami League as the party has any role in the recent violent protests at Dhaka University. About Khaleda's claims that her son Tarique Rahman was not involved in any corruption during her latest five-year term, Amu said: "What's her position about the media reports that detailed her administration's pervasive corruption? "A huge amount of black money has already been deposited to the government's coffers. What would she say about that?" bdnews24.
