<TITLE> Embattled Sen. Craig to resign: report </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Sept. (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Long-serving Republican Sen. Larry Craig of Idaho, embroiled in a sex scandal and finding little support from his party, will resign from the Senate, CNN reported on Friday. Citing an unidentified Republican source in Idaho, CNN said Craig would announce on Saturday that he planned to leave office on September 30. Craig spokesman Dan Whiting said: "I won't confirm or deny. You will have to wait until tomorrow to hear an official response." Whiting said earlier that Craig would make the announcement about his plans on Saturday morning in Boise, Idaho, Craig's home state. In the event of Craig's resignation, Idaho's Republican governor is expected to appoint a Republican to serve out Craig's term. The result would be no change in the balance of power in the Senate, which is controlled by Democrats 51-49. Craig's term in the Senate expires in January 2009. Earlier this month, Craig, a veteran Senate Republican, pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct after a June 11 arrest in the men's restroom of the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport. Police were targeting the toilet because of problems with lewd behavior there. In his last public appearance on Tuesday, Craig denied having done anything wrong. He also declared he was not a homosexual and said he had admitted guilt without consulting a lawyer and only "in the hope of making it (the case) go away." Since then, many of Craig's fellow Republicans have called on him to resign or have criticized his behavior. The few statements of support have been tepid. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky called Craig's conduct unforgivable in a newspaper interview in Kentucky. He would not say whether Craig should resign. Craig served in the US House of Representatives from 1981 to 1990, when he was elected to the Senate. Craig, a conservative, has voted against measures to expand homosexual rights.
