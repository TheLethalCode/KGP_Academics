 Dhaka, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) held a reception Sunday for immediate past chief selector Faruque Ahmed and member Athar Ali Khan, as well as newly appointed chief selector Rafiq-ul-Alam and member Naimur Rahman Durjoy. Members of the BCB ad-hoc committee Gazi Ashraf Hossain Lipu, Lt Col (retd) MA Latif and Ishtiaque Ahmed thanked the outgoing selectors for their wonderful job over the past four years. "Team selection has never been an easy job for us. But we tried to give our best. I feel honoured for being the national selector for such a long time," said Faruq Ahmed, also former Bangladesh captain. "This reception came to me as a surprise. I would like to thank all who were associated with our job," said Athar Ali. The outgoing selectors also wished their successors Rafiq-ul-Alam and Naimur Rahman good luck. The four-year stint of the selectors came to an end on July 31 but the BCB extended their job for one month to August 31, in a bid to pick the Twenty20 World Cup squad along with a BCB academy squad for the Australia tour. BCB members, M Abdul Momen, Feroz Ahmed, Selim Bhuiyan, Monwara Anis Khan, and staff were among others present on the occasion at its management office in Gulshan. bdn
