 BERLIN, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany has arrested three men suspected of belonging to an Islamist terrorist group and planning attacks, German officials said on Wednesday. The three are suspected of planning attacks at Frankfurt international airport and a major US military base in Ramstein, German public broadcast network Suedwestrundfunk (SWR) said. German federal prosecutors and Defence Minister Franz Josef Jung confirmed the arrests. Jung told German television they had been taken into custody and were planning attacks soon. "There was an imminent security threat," Jung said, adding it was "very concrete". "The security services have done a very good job and I can't say anything more at this point." In a statement ahead of a news conference planned for 0900 GMT on Wednesday, the Federal Prosecutor's Office in Karlsruhe said raids had been carried out in several German states. "The German federal prosecutors office ordered the arrest yesterday afternoon of three suspected members of an Islamic terrorist organisation," the office said in a statement. Earlier, the SWR network quoted security sources in Berlin as saying two of the suspects were German nationals and one had a Pakistani passport. German television reported that explosive materials had been found in an apartment in a town in the northern state of Hesse. It said the planning was at an advanced stage. Captain Jeff Gradeck, a spokesman for the US European Command (EUCOM) in Stuttgart, said: "We don't have any information yet that US facilities were targeted." There was no comment from Frankfurt airport. Frankfurt international airport is one of Europe's busiest. The Ramstein base in the nearby state of Rhineland-Palatinate, 130 km (80 miles) southwest of the airport, is one of the most important US air bases overseas. Germany, which has forces stationed in Afghanistan, has been on high alert for attacks. The country has feared a re-emergence of militant Islamic groups since 2001, when the northern port city of Hamburg was used as a base for planning the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States. Earlier this year, federal prosecutors charged a Lebanese man held in detention over an unsuccessful attempt to detonate bombs on two trains in Germany in 2006. He and another suspect were caught on surveillance cameras wheeling suitcases containing bombs aboard trains at Cologne's main railway station. Both men left suitcases on the trains, which they planned to detonate later in the day with a timed explosive device. Despite being activated, the bombs failed to go off because of a technical error, the prosecutor's office said. bd
