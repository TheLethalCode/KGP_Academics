 MOGADISHU, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fighting between Somali government forces and insurgents killed several people in Mogadishu on Wednesday, police and residents said, in some of the worst clashes since a peace conference ended. Residents woke to the rattle of machinegun fire as gunmen battled police and soldiers in the rubble-strewn streets of the coastal capital.

Opposition figures, including some Islamist leaders, plan to hold a rival conference in Eritrea starting on Thursday, to try to unite Somalia's anti-government forces. Somali Ambassador to Kenya Mohamed Abdi Nur criticised the move as redundant and unhelpful. "We believe anything organised outside the country will come to nothing," he told a news conference.
