<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission Sunday filed a case against Sheikh Hasina on charges of taking Tk 3 crore in bribe from a power company during her days as prime minister. The case is a fourth against Hasina as the former prime minister is facing charges of extortion in three separate cases. ACC assistant director SM Sabbir Hossain filed the latest case with Tejgaon Police Station, saying Hasina during her initial years in office had received the amount. The sum was later allegedly used to buy a building for Bangabandhu Memorial Trust in Dhanmondi in 1997, according to case details. Apart from Hasina, six other people, including the then power secretary Dr Toufiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury and the then Power Development Board chairman Nooruddin Mahmud Kamal, have been accused of having had roles in the alleged corruption. Hasina had allegedly received the sum in eight cheques and pay orders of American Express Bank, Standard Chartered, Eastern Bank, Dhaka Bank, Arab Bangladesh Bank and formerly ANZ Grindlays in different times from October 20, 1996 to November 24, 1997. Local representatives of Wartsila Power Development Ltd Consortium paid the money to get the work order for installation of a barge-mounted power plant in Khulna although the company was not the lowest bidder. According to Summit's website (http://www.summit-centre.com/co/kpcl.html), the plant was implemented by the founder sponsor of the country's first private sector power company, Khulna Power Company Ltd (KPCL), a consortium of Summit Industrial & Mercantile Corporation (Pvt) Limited, United Enterprises & Co Ltd and Wartsila NSD Corporation, Finland. According to the case documents, Hasina approved the project proposal on October 11 and signed the power purchase agreement with the company on October 16, 1997. According to the plaintiff, the New England Power Company was the lowest bidder to set up the barge-mounted power plant but it did not get the work. Alongside giving the work to Warstila Power Development Ltd Consortium in exchange of bribe, money laundering was also allowed through giving the company permission to import fuel, the plaintiff alleged. Toufiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury had allegedly aided Hasina to commit the corruption, according to the case papers. Toufiq-e-Elahi made the deal with the bidder on behalf of Hasina. The then PDB chairman had arranged the agreement with Warstila following the instruction of Hasina and under pressure from the power secretary, according to the case. The first information report of the case said Hasina had received the bribe at the Prime Minister's Office. The report said Hasina bought a two-storey building on 19 katha 11 chhatak land down Dhanmondi Road No. 32 (Old), holding No. 678, for Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Memorial Trust for Tk 6.5 crore on October 8, 1997. The report said Summit Group paid the landlord Tk 1.45 crore on October 7 while United Group gave Tk 55 lakh on October 8, 1997. On November 24, the owner of the land was paid another Tk 1 crore. The previous two cases on charges of extortion were filed against Hasina with Tejgaon and Gulshan police stations on June 13 on extortion charges. The two cases charged her with taking Tk 8.99 crore in return for allowing installation of power plants. The complainants had said they were forced to pay the amount, otherwise they were threatened not to get their projects approved. Businessman Noor Ali filed the case with Tejgaon Police Station, also accusing Hasina's cousin Sheikh Helaluddin and his wife Rupa Chowdhury. Managing director of business firm Eastcoast Trading Ltd Azam Jahangir Chowdhury filed the other case with Gulshan Police Station. Hasina's cousin and former health minister Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim has been made the main accused in the case. Another businessman Tajul Islam Faruk filed a Tk 3 crore extortion case against Hasina with Tejgaon Police Station on April 9. All the cases were filed after the military-backed interim government came to power in mid-January amid a state of emergency. Hasina has been in a special jail awaiting trial since July 16. Hasina and her Awami League had earlier rejected the charges and said they were aimed at preventing her from taking part in next voting, which is expected to be held sometime between October and December next year. bdnews24.com/lh/gm
