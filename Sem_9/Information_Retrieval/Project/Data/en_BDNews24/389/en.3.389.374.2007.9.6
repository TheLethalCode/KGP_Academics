<TITLE> China's Hu wants UN framework on climate change </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SYDNEY, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese President Hu Jintao gave qualified support on Thursday to an Australian initiative on climate change, saying the "Sydney Declaration" is fine as long as it is in line with a UN framework. Hu made the comments in a rare news conference after meeting Australian Prime Minister John Howard. "We very much hope that this Sydney Declaration will give full expression to the position that the UN framework convention on climate change would remain the main channel for international efforts to tackle climate change," he said. The declaration should also reflect UN principles of "common but differentiated responsibilities" toward lowering harmful greenhouse gas emissions. Australia, as host of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, has put climate change at the top of the agenda. Its draft declaration calls for a new global framework that would include "aspirational" targets for all APEC members on lowering greenhouse gas emissions, which scientists say is causing the climate to change. Australia, backed by the United States, says the Kyoto protocol, the main climate change treaty, is flawed because it does not commit big polluters in the developing world, such as India and China, to the same kind of targets as industrialised nations. That approach is getting a decidedly lukewarm response at the APEC meeting from developing countries, which prefer to see the whole issue handled at a U.N. meeting later this month in New York. "As one of our ministers, (Malaysia Trade Minister) Rafidah said, that E (in APEC) stands for economic, not environment," Indonesian Trade Minister Mari Pangestu told reporters, adding ministers should look at how climate change affects business. APEC ministers were grappling with the issue behind closed doors at a two-day meeting ending on Thursday, trying to agree on the wording of the declaration to be issued at a weekend summit. Kyoto's first phase runs out in 2012 and the APEC summit is one of a growing number of efforts to find a formula that brings rich and developing countries together on climate change. Hu has had a warm reception since his arrival in Australia on Monday when he visited the mining-rich state of Western Australia before heading to Canberra and a tour of a sheep farm. But in Sydney, three rallies were scheduled on Thursday to protest against China's human rights record, including one by the religious group Falun Gong that attracted up to 2,000 people in Sydney's Hyde Park. Australia has launched its biggest ever security operation in Sydney to welcome the 21 leaders attending this week's APEC meetings. Newspapers have dubbed the city of more than 4 million people "Fortress Sydney". Bush meets Hu later on Thursday and says he expects to have robust discussions on everything from product safety and trade to climate change, jailed dissidents, Beijing's support for Myanamar's junta, the Dalai Lama and Iran. The two men are only scheduled to meet for 20 minutes. At his news conference, Hu said China took international concerns over product safety very seriously. "The Chinese side is willing and ready to work together with the international community to step up cooperation in quality inspections and examinations and further deepen mutually beneficial economic cooperation and trade," he said. On climate change, Bush said China has "to be a part of defining the goals". "Once we can get people to define the goals, then we can encourage people to define the tactics necessary to achieve the goals," he said at a news conference on Wednesday. "I believe this strategy is going to be a lot more effective than trying ... to say, this is what you've got to do." Bush started his day on Thursday meeting Australia's opposition leader Kevin Rudd, who has vowed to bring back Australian frontline troops from the Iraq war, calling it the biggest foreign policy disaster since Vietnam. Rudd holds a commanding lead in opinion poll over Howard -- a staunch supporter of the war -- ahead of a general election expected in the coming weeks, and soon could be in a position to reverse Howard's policies on the w
