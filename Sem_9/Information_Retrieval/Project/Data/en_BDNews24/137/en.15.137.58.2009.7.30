<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 30 (bdnews24.com)Shamsul Haq Tuku, the state minister for energy and power, told deputy commissioners on Thursday to ensure that all shops and markets in their districts kept to 8pm closing times during Ramadan to ease power supply shortfalls. "In a bid to reduce load-shedding, we have decided to order all shops and markets to stick to 8.00pm closure during Ramadan," Tuku told reporters after the final day of a three-day council of deputy commissioners. "The move is also in line with the labour law." He said homes and businesses had to consume electricity responsibly and asked the DCs to ensure proper distribution of energy-saving light bulbs. Tuku added that the DCs had told him that they had already begun implementing the order. "The government is facing problems because no power has been added to the national grid for the last seven years," said Tuku. He said the government would ensure steady electricity supply for Sahri, Iftar and Tarabi prayers during Ramadan. Energy adviser to the prime minister Tawfiq-e-Elahi also attended the deputy commissioners' council. bdnews
