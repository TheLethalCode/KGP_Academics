 Dhaka, July 30 (bdnews24.com)Former information secretary ATM Fazlul Karim, also known as Abu Karim, secured bail on Thursday after surrender to a Dhaka court in cases involving charges of making 'seditious statements' and hurting religious sentiment through his poetry. Karim, who was forced into compulsory retirement in February, surrendered to the court of metropolitan magistrate Emdadul Islam and secured bail on a bond of Tk 10,000. The court had ordered his arrest on July 22. The civil servant, who was given the crucial information ministry posting on Jan 19, lost his job on Feb 23. A total of four cases have been filed against the ex-secretary for writing a poem entitled 'Bagane Fute Ache Oshonkho Golap' (Many roses have bloomed in the garden), which allegedly insulted Islam, independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family. A warrant of arrest was issued against Karim on March 2 in connection with the original case filed by president of Bangladesh Awami Olama League Maulana Ilias Hossain Bin Helali at the Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court on March 5. Lawyer Omar Faruq and Awami Bastuhara League member CM Alam filed two cases with the CMM's court on Feb 24 for 'anti-state sentiments' and 'hurting religious sentiment'. Plaintiff Omar Faruq, a member of said the poem, 'Bagane Fute Ase Osongkho Golap' by Abu Karim, Fazlul Karim's pen name, obscenely termed the Bangla language as "Bokhara" and Bangladesh as "Bokhari". The verse was alleged to be also derogatory to Sheikh Mujib's three sons, naming Sheikh Kamal as "Kamalakali", Sheikh Jamal as "Jamtali" and Sheikh Russel as "Rasokali", the cases said. He said a verse of the poem termed Islam as "Chil Dharma (hawk religion)" and named India as "Kaksthan (crow land)", which hurt religious sentiment. bd
