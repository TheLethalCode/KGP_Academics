<TITLE> I'm the greatest Italian athlete ever, says Pellegrini </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ROME Jul 30, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Federica Pellegrini said she was the greatest Italian athlete ever after winning the 200 metre freestyle at the world swimming championships on Tuesday in a world record, her 10th overall. Pellegrini, 20, clocked one minute, 52.98 seconds in winning the 200, breaking her own world record. She also was the first woman to break four minutes in the 400 when she won in 3:59.15 on Sunday. "Without any false modesty, I didn't think there were any doubts about that as of a few world records ago. There you have it," Pellegrini, who won the Olympic 200 last year, said when asked if she was the greatest Italian athlete. "With today's world record, I've had 10 world records before I'm 21. I've won an Olympic gold medal, two world championship gold medals here. So, I think so," she told a news conference. Pellegrini, who enjoys celebrity status in Italy, said she was "destroyed physically and psychologically" after the two events. "The times I've had in the world championships here in Rome really surprised me and I really worked a lot on my 400 metres," she said. "In the 400 metres I never thought I could get below four minutes, and in the 200 I never thought I could be so fast." Pellegrini, who also won an Olympic silver medal in the 200 in 2004, said she had trained with men since she was 14, a regime she called "mind-blowing, women can't keep up". "In training, I can't beat the men but I can come close. 1:52 in the 200, that's almost a man's time. 3:59, not yet," she said. Pellegrini will swim the 4x200 freestyle relay on Thursday and then take a vacation after what she called "the air bubble" of the championships.
