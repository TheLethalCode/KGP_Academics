 Pabna, July 30 (bdnews24.com)  Two suspected extremists were killed in a blast from 'cocktail bombs' thrown at them by members of a rival group, at Ataikula Upazila in Pabna, police said on Thursday. The dead were identified as Abdus Sattar, 32, and his uncle Abdur Razzak, 50, of the banned extremist Purba Banglar Communist Party (ML-Red Flag), Pabna superintendent of police Nibash Chandra Majhi told bdnews24.com. He said Sattar died on the spot, while Razzak died after being taken to Pabna General Hospital. Majhi said members of the rival Purba Banglar Communist Party (ML-Janajuddha) faction attacked them in Ataikula's Purbabangram area as they were heading to Pushpapara market. The rival group fired five or six round of bullets and hurled handmade bombs at Sattar and Razzak, said the superintendent. A case was filed with Ataikul Police Station. But none has been arrested yet, Majhi said. A local BNP leader claimed the victims were their party workers and had been attacked by political rivals. bdn
