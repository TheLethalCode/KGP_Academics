 Dhaka, July 30 (bdnews24.com)Some of the Awami League behemoths, who dominated the party's politics for decades, will not have a say in the policymaking and executive affairs as the ruling party rolled out a fully fledged committee on Thursday, five days after the national council. Heavyweights Amir Hossain Amu, Abdur Razzak, Tofael Ahmed, Suranjit Sengupta and Abdul Jalil were delivered the coup de grcedropped from the Presidium, the party's highest policy-making body. They have been sidelined to the ceremonial 20-strong advisory council, apparently paying the price for pursuing 'reforms', the buzzword in politics during the two years of emergency rule synonymous with desperate attempts to install a new party leadership exiling none other than party president Sheikh Hasina. Razzak had publicly declared a set of reforms including barring the party president and general secretary from holding the posts for more than two terms in a row, which, if implemented, would divest Hasina of her post as president of the party. Tofael and Suranjit announced their own set of reform proposals that pretty much echoed Razzak's. Amu was one of Hasina's strongest critics and vocal about having the reform plans implemented to promote accountability, joint leadership and democratic practices in the party. Sahara Khatun, Abdul Latif Siddique, Raziuddin Ahmed Razu, Satish Chandra Roy, Obaidul Qader and Yousuf Mohammad Humayun have been included in the new-look presidium to replace the four and fill the places of former presidium members, President Zillur Rahman and the late Abdus Samad Azad. Saber Hossain Chowdhury, Mukul Bose, Mahmudur Rahman Manna, Akhteruzzaman and Sultan Mohammed Monsur Ahmed, all so-called 'reformists', are the other big names failing to make the cut in the Central Working Committee, the highest executive forum. The party council on July 24 dissolved the old committee, which includes a 15-member presidium, 30 secretaries and 26 members. The AL had unanimously re-elected Hasina as party president for a sixth time during the council and trusted Syed Ashraful Islam as general secretary at the cost of Abdul Jalil who resigned two days prior to the council and who had spoken out against Hasina during detention in prison. Syed Ashraf unveiled the names to the media at a press briefing at the prime minister's official residence in the evening. All the seven organising secretaries of the previous committee failed to make the cut. Names of Mahbubul Alam Hanif and Dipu Moni were announced among the three joint general secretaries. The seven organising secretaries are Jahangir Kabir Nanok, Ahmed Hossain, ABM Mozammel Huq, Mesbah Uddin Siraj, AFM Bahauddin Nasim, Abu Sayeed Swopon and Khalid Mahmud Chowdhury. The council on July 24 tasked Hasina and Ashraf to pick leaders for 45 posts in the central working committee. The constitution vests powers solely on the president to choose 26 of the 73 members of that committee. The councillors in closed-door deliberations endorsed a proposal to empower Hasina and Ashraf to pick 13 other leaders for the party's policymaking presidium, and 31 departmental secretaries. The new presidium now comprises Hasina, Ashraf, Sayeda Johra Tajuddin, Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir, Motia Chowdhury, Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, Kazi Jafrullah, Abdul Mannan, Ataur Rahman Khan Kaiser, Sahara Khatun, Abdul Latif Siddique, Raziuddin Ahmed Razu, Satish Chandra Roy and Obaidul Qader. The secretaries are AHM Mostafa Kamal (Lotus)-finance and planning secretary, Syed Abul Hossen-international affairs secretary, Abdul Matin Khasru-law secretary, Abdur Razzaq- agriculture and cooperatives secretary, Faridunnahar Laily- relief and social welfare secretary, Abdul Manna Khan-office secretary, Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah-religious affairs secretary, Nuh-ul-Alam Lenin-publicity secretary, Hasan Mahmud-environment affairs secretary, Yafes Osman- science and technology secretary, Fajilatunnesa Indira-women affairs secretary, ABM Tazul Islam-liberation war affairs secretary, Dewan Shafiul Arefin Tutul-youth and sports secretary, Nurul Islam Nahid-education secretary, Faruk Khan-commerce and industry secretary, Habibur Rahman Siraj-labour and manpower secretary, Asaduzzaman Noor-cultural affairs secretary, Bodiuzzaman Bhuiyan-health and population secretary, HN Ashiqur Rahman-treasurer, Mrinal Kanti Das- deputy office secretary and Asim Kumar Ukil, deputy publicity secretary. bdnews
