 Dhaka, July 30 (bdnews24.com)The government has asked international organisations and countries to help it with more evidence and documents for the trial of war crimes in 1971, the law minister said on Thursday. "We need evidence and documents to make trial of the crimes committed 38 years ago fair, transparent and acceptable," Shafique Ahmed told an international conference titled 'Genocide: Truth and justice' at CIRDAP auditorium. The Liberation War Museum organised the two-day seminar. The documents can be found in many countries, he said and added that the government already had had enough evidence to press charges "We are seeking more evidence to make the trial internationally acceptable so that no question arises after the trial." The minister said those people would face trial that had committed crimes against human in association with the Pakistan army in Bangladesh territory. "We have amended International Crimes (Tribunals) Act 1973 to try those who committed crime against humanity," the minister said. "It is difficult to hold the trial of crimes committed 38 years ago. We will form the investigating agency, prosecution and tribunal with honest, skilled and experienced people. "We will employ senior police officials in the investigating agency and the chief law officers who are experienced and well versed in international law." The minister sought assistance of the international organisations that have worked on genocide committed in many countries. "Nobody will be brought to justice only for political persecution. The real criminals will be put on trial. "They will get all facilities in accordance with transparent trial procedure including self defence," Ahmed said. "The conference will be helpful for the trial of war criminals in our country," he said. bdne
