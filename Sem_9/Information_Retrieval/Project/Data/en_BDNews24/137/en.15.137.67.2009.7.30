 Dhaka, July 30 (bdnews24.com)The government on Thursday retired two judges, holding the top two posts in the Judicial Service Association, for "failing to abide by good conduct and discipline in public administration". JSA president Mohammad Abdul Gafur, a Dhaka district sessions judge, and JSA secretary-general Mohammad Shahjahan, of the Gazipur Women and Children Repression Prevention Tribunal, were sent into retirement, a government handout said. The move follows a protest on July 27 by members of the judiciary who complained that they had not been properly consulted over the proposed division of the law, justice and parliamentary affairs ministry as part of judicial reforms. Around 150 judicial officials, led by Gafur and Shahjahan, met with law minister Shafique Ahmed at the secretariat last Monday to complain that their opinions had not been solicited prior to the process of separation of the judiciary that began in 2007. They also demanded removal of law secretary Kazi Habibul Awal. Deputy home secretary for security Naizam Uddin Khan later arrived at the scene with armed police. A JSA leader, not wishing to be named, told bdnews24.com: "The government has no jurisdiction to take such an action without the chief justice's approval." He said the move was contrary to the Constitution, adding that the JSA would hold a meeting on the issue on Sunday.
