 Dhaka, July 30 (bdnews24.com)Police recovered the mutilated body of an 18-year-old youth from the densely populated residential area of Jurain in the capital on Thursday. "We recovered the decapitated body of a young man known as Roni from a road in Jurain at 12:30am, after being alerted by locals," Sakir Mohammad Jubaer, sub-inspector of Kadamtali Police Station, told bdnews24.com. Jubaer said he could not confirm the identity of the killers, but police were pursuing some solid leads. "A group of four or five people called Roni away from his house in Afsar Karim Road in the morning," Nadia Bagum, the victim's aunt told bdnews24.com. "Twenty-minutes later I received news of Roni's death," said Nadia Bagum. She alleged that witnesses living in the area were withholding information on the murder. Sub-inspector Jubaer said Roni may have been murdered as a result of an affair with a local girl.
