 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com environment correspondent Dhaka, July 30 (bdnews24.com)  As a Bangladesh parliamentary team was mid-way through a visit to India on Thursday to gather data on the controversial Tipaimukh Dam project, Indian anti-dam groups in the northeast state of Manipur called on their government to give them a hearing too. Indian groups, Citizens Concern for Dams and Development (CCDD), Committee on Land and Natural Resources (COLNAR) and Action Against the Tipaimukh Dam Project (ACTIP), in a joint statement on the visit of the Bangladesh Parliamentary Committee to the dam site, said the Tipaimukh dam "must be scrapped". They said the Indian government gave a warm welcome to the Bangladesh delegation but has not till date given any kind of hearing to those who are going to be affected by the dam in Manipur, Assam and Mizoram. They said, "The Tipaimukh dam is now being resisted from all sides, upstream and downstream, from all communities. The only supporter remains the government of India and the state of Manipur" Environmental pressure groups in Bangladesh and India's Manipur state, planned site of the dam, have been voicing concern over the potential impact in downstream regions. The people of Manipur, one of the are also concerned about the potential displacement of local communities by the project. The hugely contentious dam would straddle the cross-border Barak River, which crosses Monipur and enters Bangladesh as it divides into the Surma and Kushiara rivers. The two rivers are the source for hundreds of water bodies in the greater Sylhet region. India claims the Tipaimukh dam would not withhold water from Bangladesh as it is part of a power generation and not intended for irrigation purposes. In their statement, the Indian anti-dam groups said, "Tipaimukh dam is now being resisted from all sides, upstream and downstream, from all communities. The only supporter remains the government of India and Manipur" "From the ongoing 15 years resistance in Manipur to the mass anti-dam mobilisation in Bangladesh to the recent gathering against the dam in the Barak valley in Assam, it is clear that dam must be abandoned." ion. "Our opposition to the dam remains as firm today as it was fifteen years ago. We will continue to fight against forceful damming of Barak river, we will defend against forceful dislocation of our peoples." The Manipur-based action groups said they were "keenly aware that this dam has already caused conflicts and misunderstandings between upstream and downstream, between India and Bangladesh, between communities and to an extent fracture within communities." "On the visit of the Parliamentary Committee from Bangladesh, we definitely welcome them as representative of our neighbor if they are to come seeking to know more about the dam," they said. "However, we would respectfully urge them to resist any form of agreement with India." By agreeing to this dam, it will impact downstream in Bangladesh, Assam, Manipur and Mizoram. "We will continue to work with our friends living in downstream to stop this dam from coming up," they said. bdn
