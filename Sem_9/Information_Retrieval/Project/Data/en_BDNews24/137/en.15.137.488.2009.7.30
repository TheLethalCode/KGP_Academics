 Chittagong, July 30 (bdnews24.com)The Criminal Investigation Department in Chittagong summoned three senior police officers for questioning in connection with the 2004 seizure of 10 truckloads of arms in the port city, the latest in a line of top law enforcement officials to be grilled in the case. Former Chittagong Metropolitan Police deputy commissioner (port) Abdullahel Baqui (now OSD), former CMP assistant commissioner (port) Mahmudur Rahman (now OSD) and former Karnafuli police chief Ahadur Rahman (now Satkhira police chief) reported to the CID office in the morning. "The CID office summoned the three police officers to our Damparha office in the morning for questioning," Mohammad Muslim, CID Chittagong zone special superintendent and the case's supervising officer, told bdnews24.com. Muslim declined to elaborate on what the police officers were being questioned about, although he said the interrogation was likely to last till evening. A CID official, requesting anonymity, said, "Baqui and Mahmudur Rahman went to the CUFL jetty and released five individuals from police custody after the arms seizure." The notorious arms case dates back to April 1, 2004, when police seized 10 trucks of weapons and ammunition as they were being offloaded at the Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Ltd jetty. Four top former officers of the National Security Intelligence agency, including two former NSI heads, and the truck owners have been arrested and held for questioning over recent months, since new investigators were appointed to the long-stalled case that was set in motion again in January this year. Former Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation chairman Imamuzzaman and former industry secretary Nurul Amin have also been questioned by the CID in connection to the case. On July 23, a Chittagong court ordered a fourth extension, of 75-days, for investigations into the arms haul case. CID senior assistant police superintendent Moniruzzaman Chowdhury currently leads the investigation team. bdnew
