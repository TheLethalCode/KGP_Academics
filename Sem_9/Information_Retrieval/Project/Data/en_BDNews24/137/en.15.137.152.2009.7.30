 Dhaka, July 30 (bdnews24.com)The withdrawal of the rest of the troops from the Chittagong Hill Tracts will depend on law and order there, the state minister for CHT affairs said on Thursday. "The withdrawal of the remaining army troops will depend on the improvement of law and order in that the region," Dipankar Talukder told reporters after a meeting with the deputy commissioners at the Secretariat on the concluding day of the conference of DCs. The government on Wednesday announced the "biggest withdrawal" of army troops from the CHT since a peace accord was signed over a decade ago in an attempt to bring stability to the long-troubled region. The pullout of a complete brigade, including three infantry battalions and 35 security camps, will start immediately and complete by September. There has been a long-term conflict between two CHT-based partiesUnited People's Democratic Front and Pabatya Chattagram Janasanghati Samitiover the peace accord. Asked whether he believed the security situation might slide after the army withdrawal, the state minister said there was discord between the parties which will disappear after the accord was fully implemented. Talukder said the prime minister was sincere about its implementation. "The government has already reformed the (CHT) Land Commission, a taskforce has been formed. Land survey will start soon." Peace in the CHT is necessary for the development of tourism, the state minister said. Since the CHT peace treaty was signed in 1997 to end decades-old bush war, 200 security camps have been phased out, according to a press release of the Inter Services Public Relations Directorate. There are five brigades and five camps in the three CHT districts of Rangamatai, Khagrachharhi and Bandarban. bdne
