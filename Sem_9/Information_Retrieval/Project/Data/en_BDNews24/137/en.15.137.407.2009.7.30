 Dhaka, July 30 (bdnews24.com)  Adviser to the prime minister for establishment and administration HT Imam has asked the deputy commissioners to work in coordination with members of parliament in their districts. "You must think how you can work for mass interest, and for this reason should coordinate with the MPs," he said on the concluding day of a three-day council of deputy commissioners. Imam told reporters after the meeting: "DCs have tabled many problems in the council. It is a forum. It is not a trade union where they can raise their demands. We have heard their problems. Initiatives will be taken to solve them." He said DCs, the district-level chief executives, had raised problems with vehicles, office and residences of local officials at district and upazila level, vacant posts and development activities, among others. Regarding initiatives to commence e-governance in the district and upazila level administration, Imam said, "A lot of organising work has been carried at the Prime Minister's Office during the period of the DC council. Allotting laptop computers to deputy commissioners and UNOs is under consideration." Cabinet division secretary Abdul Aziz presided over the meeting at the cabinet division. Establishment secretary Iqbal Mahmud and other officials were also present. bdnew
