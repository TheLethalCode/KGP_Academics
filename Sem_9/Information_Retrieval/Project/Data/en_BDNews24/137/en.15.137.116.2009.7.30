<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 30 (bdnews24.com)The appeals court on Thursday upheld a stay order on proceedings in the Niko graft case against opposition leader and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia. Chief justice MM Ruhul Amin rejected the Anticorruption Commission's leave to appeal against a High Court ruling, made in July 2008, which stayed proceedings in the case. In May 2008, the ACC submitted a charge sheet accusing Khaleda and 10 others of 'corruption' and 'abuse of power' in awarding a gas exploration and extraction deal to Niko Resources Ltd, causing a loss of Tk 13,777 crore to the state during the BNP tenure from 2001 to 2006. Advocate Abdul Aziz Khan represented the anti-graft agency, while Rafiqul Islam Miah stood for the former prime minister in the hearing.
