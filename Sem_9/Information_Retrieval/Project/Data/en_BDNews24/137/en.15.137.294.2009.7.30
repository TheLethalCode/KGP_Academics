 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, July 30 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary watchdog will suggest that the shipping ministry ask the Anticorruption Commission to charge former shipping adviser MA Matin and ex-shipping secretary Sheikh Motahar Hossain with irregularities in the container management deal at Chittagong port. It has also recommended cases and departmental actions against seven others and put out the contract to tender again. Details about the officials against whom the ministry may file the case and take departmental action were sketchy as the report was yet to be made public. Abdul Matin, a joint secretary, Sharif Masud, now an assistant secretary, commodore R U Ahmed, who was made chairman of the Chittagong Port Authority on contract, are among those facing action. The recommendations came Thursday at a meeting of the parliamentary standing committee on shipping ministry. The standing committee unanimously accepted the report of the parliamentary sub-committee that found "massive irregularities" done by Matin and eight others on the last day of his office on Jan 6. The committee, however, did not find any evidence that Matin had taken bribe to land the company, Ishaq Brothers, the deal, Chowdhury said. However, Matin, a retired major general who was a director general of Bureau of Anti-Corruption, the ACC's predecessor, maintained that he did nothing wrong. "Former adviser M A Matin had direct role in awarding the work to the company in violation of the government guidelines," Noor-e-Alam Chowdhury, the committee chairman, told journalists at a press briefing at parliament's media centre. The chairman said former secretary Sheikh Motahar Hossain and seven officials were also involved in the deal. "He (Matin) pressed officials to award the contract," said Chowdhury. The chairman said the tender was not invited properly in line with the government rules and the CPA did not hold any board meeting before awarding the contract. Besides, false certificate was given in favour of Ishaq Brothers, a "novice" company. "Therefore, we have asked the ministry to refer the case to the Anticorruption Commission," said Chowdhury. He said the tendering process caused financial losses to the public exchequer. "So, we have also asked the ministry to file cases to realise the money," said the chairman. Matin was also home adviser and chief of the corruption-busting national committee formed by the past military-installed caretaker government. The standing committee found that Matin had allegedly arranged a board meeting of the CPA in the afternoon of Jan 5 to evaluate the tender committee's report. The CPA initiated the file to award the contract within 24 hours to Ishaq Brothers after the meeting and couriered it to Dhaka by air, the committee said. The file was accepted on Jan 6 morning and the same was sent to CPA for necessary actions after the adviser had signed it. The file reached Chittagong in the afternoon of Jan 6 and the CPA awarded the work to Ishaq Brothers at 9pm when the new government was taking oath at the Bangabhaban. Mohammed Shah Alam, who heads the sub-committee, had told bdnews24.com on July 26 that they had enough papers that pointed to Matin's involvement in the corruption and would not summon him to defend himself against the charges. The standing committee also alleged that Matin had raised the service age of "pilots" at Chittagong port to 60 years from 57. "He is not the authority to increase age of any public servants. This should be a political decision. He must be made accountable for this," Alam had said. Matin was the first adviser to the 2007-2008 caretaker government to face corruption charges. Housing and public works adviser Moinul Hosein was the other adviser to come under parliamentary scrutiny for allegedly awarding public land to his wife and son in violation of government rules. Alam had said that acting shipping secretary Masud Elahi and senior assistant shipping secretary Sharif Mohammad Masud involved in the deal had confessed at the meeting that Matin had forced them to award the contract to Ishaq Brothers in violation of government rules. And the officials of the CPA submitted papers which proved Matin's direct involvement in awarding the work, he added. Both advisers were very critical of the politicians for 'corruption' after the declaration of the state of emergency on Jan 11, 2007. The standing committee on May 27 formed three-member panel to investigate the alleged irregularities. Awami League's Shamsul Haq Chowdhury and the BNP's Mostofa Kamal Pasha are the other members of the probe body. bd
