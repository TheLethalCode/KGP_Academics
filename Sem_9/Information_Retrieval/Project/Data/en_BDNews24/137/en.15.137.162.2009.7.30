<TITLE> Tigers aim for clean sweep </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 30 (bdnews25.com)  The Bangladesh national cricket team will be looking for a clean sweep over West Indies when they square off against the hosts in the third and final match of the ODI series at Warner Park in St. Kitts on Friday. With the series already assured with a match in hand, the Tigers are definitely flying high, and are in no mood to showing any mercy to the home side, who persisted with a makeshift squad with the exclusion of pacer Nelon Pascal due to a finger injury. Whitewash is nothing new for the Tigers, having done so against the likes of Zimbabwe, Kenya, Scotland and Ireland, but never achieved it against a major Test-playing nation. Four of Bangladesh's five previous clean sweep victories came on home soil against Kenya, Zimbabwe, Scotland and Ireland. Stand-in-captain Shakib Al Hasan and Mohammad Ashraful have been showing consistency and the team management will be hoping for another knock from them, the two architects of Bangladesh's successful highest chase-run win against West Indies. The team's think-tank might be reluctant of any experimentation, though a change or two especially in the pace bowling department is not very unlikely. Young pacer Rubel Hossain may deserve a rest after having played almost every match of the tour while Syed Rasel, who joined the one-day squad, proved toothless with his modest pace in the first two matches. Nazmul Hossain and Mahbubul Alam, who are yet to open the bowling in the Caribbean, might be given room to prove themselves before heading for Zimbabwe for a five one-day internationals series next month. Teams: Bangladesh: Tamim Iqbal, Junaed Siddique, Mohammad Ashraful, Raqibul Hasan, Shakib Al Hasan, Mahmudullah Riyad, Mushfiqur Rahim, Naeem Islam, Abdur Razzak, Nazmul Hossain, Mahbubul Alam, Syed Rasel, Rubel Hossain and Mehrab Hossain Jr. West Indies: Floyd Reifer, Darren Sammy, David Bernard, Travis Dowlin, Andre Fletcher, Rawl Lewis, Nikita Miller, Kieran Powell, Dale Richards, Kemar Roach, Devon Smith, Devon Thomas and Gavin Tonge. bd
