<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 4 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission is planning to hold Dhaka City Corporation polls in May but has no plans to hold Union Parishad (UP) elections, which were last held in 2003. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda told reporters on Sunday that the commission (EC) would stick to its plan of holding Dhaka City Corporation polls in May. "But we can't say anything about the Union Parishad polls, as the relevant law needs a number of amendments." The EC earlier said that it would initially hold UP elections in the coastal areas in May. The 5-year tenure of more than 4,000 union councils, the lowest administrative unit in Bangladesh, expired in 2008. Huda said they would hold DCC polls in line with the previous boundaries. Delimitation of city corporation constituencies is expected to be implemented after the elections. The commission began delimiting the DCC wards following a court order of February. The DCC polls schedule will be declared by Apr 18 after getting city corporation regulations in hand, Huda said. "We are contacting the law and local government ministries for formulation of the regulations. We will declare a schedule within a day or two of receiving the regulations." He dismissed the chance of further postponement of the polls. The CEC, however, admitted that the commission had delayed preparations of the city corporation regulations after passage of the local government (city corporation) Act. b
