 Dhaka, Mar 30 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court has ordered Jamaat-e-Islami chief Matiur Rahman Nizami and four senior party leaders to appear before it Apr 28 in a case accusing them of hurting religious sentiments. Metropolitan magistrate Mehdi Hasan gave the order on Tuesday in the case filed by Bangladesh Tariqat Foundation on Mar 21 in Dhaka. Others accused in the case are Jamaat secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed, executive committee member Delwar Hossain Saeedee, the chief of Jamaat's Dhaka Metropolitan (South) unit ASM Yahia and Dhaka city Jamaat amir Rafiqul Islam Khan. The case was filed after Khan reportedly compared Nizami to Prophet Hazrat Muhammad (PBUH) at a Mar 17 meeting of the pro-Jamaat student front Islami Chhatra Shibir in the city. Various newspapers on Mar 18 reported Khan saying that the prophet in his lifetime was "tortured, falsified and conspired against" and "the same is happening in the case of Nizami". More cases were filed in this connection in other districts including Chandpur and Rangamati. The High Court on Monday granted anticipatory bail to the five Jamaat leaders in connection with the cases. b
