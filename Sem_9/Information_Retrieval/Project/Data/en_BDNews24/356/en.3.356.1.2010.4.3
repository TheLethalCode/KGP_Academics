 MANCHESTER, Apr 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A controversial goal from Didier Drogba helped Chelsea to a crucial 2-1 victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford on Saturday and leapfrog the champions at the top of the Premier League table. Goals from Joe Cole after 20 minutes and a second from substitute Drogba in the 79th -- in an offside position when he collected the ball before scoring -- put Chelsea 2-0 ahead before substitute Federico Macheda scored two minutes later to give United hope of salvaging at least a point.

But just when United seemed likely to find an equaliser, Chelsea doubled their lead. Drogba, who replaced Nicolas Anelka 10 minutes earlier got the goal when he blasted the ball past Edwin van der Sar, but he was clearly in an offside position when he collected the ball from Saloman Kalou. Italian teenager Macheda set up a frantic finale when he bundled the ball in off a clearance from Chelsea keeper Petr Cech, but although Berbatov powered in a volley and a had a header saved, United could not save themselves. Arsenal, in third place on 68 points, could close the gap on United to one point if they beat Wolverhampton Wanderers in a 3:00pm British time kickoff at the Emirates Sta
