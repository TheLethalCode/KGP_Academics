 Dhaka, Apr 2 (bdnews24.com)  More than 1,000 ship-breakers have died over the last 12 years due to the negligence of the owners, alleged a group of environmental activists.

The keynote paper, prepared by the group's Aminur Rasul Babul and Sabina Amin, said, "Most of those deaths occurred due to the owner's negligence over providing workers with safety and security equipment. As a result, accidents are happening regularly in the yards of Sitakunda." The report also said that besides the deaths, around 4,000-5,000 workers have been injured. "Deaths and pollution around the yards are increasing due to lack of government initiatives," Syed Rezwana Hassan, executive director of Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (BELA), told the discussuion. She demanded compensation for the families of victims. Rizwana stressed on breaking only environment-friendly ships to avoid accidents. Professor Abul Bashar, from Dhaka University's biology department, said, "Bio-diversity of the coastal area is currently under threat as the industry does not have proper measures to protect the environment." "Soil pollution is on the rise too," he added. Bashar urged for proper implementation of environmental laws and regulations. bdnews
