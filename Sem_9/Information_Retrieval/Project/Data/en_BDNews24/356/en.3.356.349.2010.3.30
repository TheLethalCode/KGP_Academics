 DHAKA, Mar 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bangladesh have recalled former captain Mohammad Ashraful to their 15-man squad for the upcoming World Twenty20 championship in West Indies, the country's cricket board said on Tuesday. Ashraful failed to register a half-century in his last 13 international innings and skipped the recent one-day series against England, instead opting to try to regain form in domestic first-class matches. However, a string of low scores in domestic cricket and in a warm-up game against the tourists cost him his place in the test squad as well. Left-arm pacer Syed Rasel also returned to the side after missing out on the New Zealand tour and England series, while left-arm spinner Mohammad Sohrawordi and batsman Jahirul Islam retained their places in the Twenty20 squad. Bangladesh will play against defending champions Pakistan and unseeded Australia in Group A of the ICC World Twenty20. Squad Shakib Al Hasan (capt), Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Jahirul Islam, Mohammad Ashraful, Aftab Ahmed, Mahmudullah, Mushfiqur Rahim, Naeem Islam, Mashrafe Bin Mortaza, Abdur Razzak, Shafiul Islam, Rubel Hossain, Syed Rasel and Mohammad Sohraw
