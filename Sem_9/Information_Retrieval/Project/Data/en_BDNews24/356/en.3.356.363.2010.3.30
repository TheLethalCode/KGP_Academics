<TEXT>
 MUNICH, Mar 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United's recent away record in the Champions League is proof of their maturity and they will use that experience to overcome a proud Bayern Munich, coach Alex Ferguson said on Monday. United, who have won all four Champions League away fixtures this season, want to reach their fourth semi-final in a row but Ferguson warned they were up against 'history' in Tuesday's quarter-final first leg in Germany. "It's a game with two clubs with great history and it puts an edge on the game. You cannot forget the record of Bayern in Europe," Ferguson told reporters.

Manchester, who have won the European Cup or Champions League title three times to Bayern's four, have surprisingly never beaten the Bavarians in European ties. Their only win over them was the memorable 1999 Champions League final in Barcelona where Manchester scored twice in the dying seconds to snatch the title from Bayern's grasp. "We have met a few times and I discovered we have never beaten them in a European tie apart from once in Barcelona," Ferguson, who took over in 1986, said with a laugh. "We intend to change t
