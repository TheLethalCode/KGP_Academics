<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 3 (bdnews24.com)  HM Ershad, MP, a significant partner of the AL-led government alliance, demanded an unequivocal declaration from prime minister Sheikh Hasina about when the chronic energy and water crisis would end. He made the demand on Saturday afternoon at the Jatiya Party office in Banani just before an emergency presidium meeting. Ershad, president of Jatiya Party, also a deposed military dictator, said that Hasina should spell out when the people will be freed from this intolerable situation caused by the ongoing crisis of electricity, water and gas. "There should be a public announcement in the media regarding the matter," he said. Apprehending a disastrous impact on agriculture in case of continued electricity shortage, Ershad said boro production would be seriously hampered without power supply. Even if the government announced that the rural areas would be prioritised over the urban areas to ensure crop irrigation, the city dwellers would still feel relieved because of the fact that the government was doing something positive for the poor people. "But then the people do not have any choice but to be patient anyway." Regarding the war crimes trial, he said it was an election manifesto of both the Awami League and the Jatiya Party. "But I do not know who these war criminals are." But those who had engaged in loot, arson, rape and murder  committed crimes against humanity  will have to be tried. "As far as I know there is a list of 36 persons involved in those criminal activities." Regarding establishment of the war crimes tribunal, Ershad said the decision was essentially to expedite the process. Jatiya Party has always been behind a transparent, accountable, fair and just trial process, he said.. Ershad said that the ruling Awami League had not had any consultation with his party, although it was a part of the government coalition. "And even if there were such consultations, I doubt that we could have had any influence." Regarding his recent hospitalisation, which had sparked off strong rumours about his health, Ershad said he regularly visits the hospital for routine check up every month. "But this time I had to be admitted because of a sodium deficiency." Ershad is scheduled to fly to Singapore for medical treatment with his wife Rawshan Ershad on Sunday. b
