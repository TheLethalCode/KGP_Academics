 Dhaka, Mar 29 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Monday ordered the government not to bar former BNP MP Rasheduzzaman Millat from leaving the country. Justice Md Shahidul Islam's vacation bench gave the order based on a petition by Millat. The petition stated that Millat was barred at the Shahjalal International Airport on Mar 27-28 when he wanted to go abroad for medical treatment. He filed a petition with the HC challenging the bar on Sunday. Millat was charged by the ACC in two cases for corruption during the caretaker government. One case alleged that he had concealed assets worth Tk 4.96 crore in his wealth statement and amassed wealth worth Tk 5.16 crore beyond his known sources of income with the aid of his wife and son. A separate case was also filed accusing him of evading taxes worth Tk 4.51 crore.
