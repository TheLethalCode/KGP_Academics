 Dhaka, Mar 29 (bdnews24.com)The government will shut down major fertiliser factories within 72 hours in order to divert gas to power plants on an emergency basis, as the peak electricity demand rises with the approaching summer. Officials said the decision taken after a meeting at the energy ministry on Monday, where the state minister for energy and power, the prime minister's advisor, energy secretary and Petrobangla chairman were present. Petrobangla chairman Hossain Monsoor told bdnews24.com: "We've decided to shut the fertiliser factories and supply more gas to the power plants that are facing severe gas crisis." "It'll take around 72 hours to stop supplying gas to the fertiliser factories." "From this, some 880mmcf gas will be saved, which will help generate an additional 400-450MW of electricity," he added. Monsoor said almost all the fertiliser factories will be shut this year, including the state-owned Urea Fertilizer Fertiliser Factory, Polash Urea Fertiliser Factory, Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Ltd and Jamuna Fertiliser Company Ltd and multinational Karnaphuli Fertiliser Company Ltd (KAFCO), as an "emergency measure". He said the decision was taken boost overall electricity supply and to help Boro irrigation around the country which is facing trouble due to power shortage. Last year, three fertiliser factories were shut down for the same reason. The country's 44 power plants are currently generating around 3800MW against a peak demand of 5300MW. At least 12 plants are generating far less power because of insufficient gas supply. On Saturday, electricity generation fell short by 769MW due to gas shortage, according to PDB. Mohammad Hossain, director of power cell, who attended the meeting, told bdnews24.com: "Since we've enough urea fertiliser stock, it will not affect Boro cultivation, which goes on to the end of April." The stock of urea fertiliser was 538,380 MT at the end of February, according to the fertiliser monitoring cell of the industries ministry. Bangladesh, in fact, faces an annual shortage of urea fertiliser. The government had a stock of around 650,000 MT urea fertiliser at the start of the season and imported another 300,000 MT against a demand of around 1.2 million MT. "However, demand for fertiliser falls at this time, towards the end of the cultivation period," Hossain said. bdn
