 Dhaka, Mar 29 (bdnews24.com) Former deputy prime minister Jamaluddin Ahmed secured bail in a fraud case after surrendering to a Dhaka court on Monday. Jamal and two other accused, Mohammad Akter Kamal and Mohammad Naser, requested bail at the Chief Metropolitan Magistrates Court. Magistrate AKM Emdadul Huq granted them bail on bonds of Tk 5,000 each. Rashed Uddin Ahmed of Century Estate in Moghbazar filed the fraud case with the same court on Mar 23 2009. The three accused are partners of chartered accountant firm Ahmad and Ahmad Associates. The case details say plaintiff Rashed and the accused established a business partnership in the name of 'Ahmad and Ahmad Chartered Accountant Firm' on Aug 1 1988 which soon rose to be one of the five top accountancy firms. But Jamal, in May 2008, declared dissolution of the company without consulting with Rashed. Jamal brought fake complaints against Rashed, according to the case statement. The plaintiff also said the accused violated the law by later launching Ahmad and Ahmad Associates, using the goodwill built by the prior company. bdnews2
