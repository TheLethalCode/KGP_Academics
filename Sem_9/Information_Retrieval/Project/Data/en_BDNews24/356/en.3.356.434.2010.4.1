 Dhaka, Apr 1 (bdnews24.com)  The police may interrogate Bashundhara chairman Ahmed Akbar Sobhan (Shah Alam) regarding a city ward commissioner's murder. However, there has not been any concrete decision yet in this regard, said the police. But they might quiz the head of Bashundhara group of companies, a major conglomerate in Bangladesh, for gathering information about the murder of Ahmed Hossain, a ward commissioner from Old Dhaka. Additional deputy commissioner of the Detective Branch Mahbubul Alam told bdnews24.com on Thursday that many names had come up in the course of investigation. "The names also included that of a real estate developer." When asked, he admitted that Shah Alam's name had also come up. Mahbubul Alam said the people who had come up would be contacted for further information through the natural course of investigation. "Like others, Shah Alam may also be quizzed at some point." But the police will decide whether or when they might speak to the business tycoon after discussion. Md Abu Tyeb, an adviser of Bashundhara's public relations, told bdnews24.com Thursday night that there was no way Shah Alam could have been involved with the murder. "He has no connection with the dead person." He said such statements were ill-motivated, baseless and completely false. Ahmed Hossain, commissioner of ward 70, was shot dead on Feb 9 at Alubazar, in front of Bara Masjid. The police arrested one Shahidul Islam Biddyut, a collector for one 'Dakat Shahid'  robber Shahid  on Mar 28 in connection with the killing. The police arrested the main shooter Kawser Ahmed and Shubhadda Union chairman, Md Nazimuddin, on the basis of Bidyut's confession. The two are still in police remand. An assistant commissioner of the detective police, requesting anonymity, told bdnews24.com that Nazimuddin had divulged some important information. According to Nazimuddin, the ward commissioner, his two brothers and Nazimuddin were associated with Pak Bangla Manufacturing Industries, which produced gas cylinder and melamine. When the factory faced financial difficulties, they began considering to sell the industrial unit. At this point, Nazimuddin contacted Shah Alam to sell the factory in 2005 upon which Shah Alam inspected the factory and proposed to buy it. But according to the police detective, quoting Nazimuddin, Ahmed Hossain was against the decision. On Mar 29, a day after arresting the three persons, police commissioner told reporters at the detective police head quarters that Ahmed's murder was linked to money. "We found no political connection in this murder," he had said on that day. Biddyut told that briefing that Nazimuddin had given Shahid Tk 40 lakh for killing Ahmed Hossain. "Subsequently he ordered the murder of the commissioner," he said.
