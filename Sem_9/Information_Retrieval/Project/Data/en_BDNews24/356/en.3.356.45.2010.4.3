 Sylhet, Apr 3(bdnews24.com)  The prime minister wants to see genuine students become members of the Bangladesh Chhatra League. Referring to the trend of 'student leaders' well into their 40s remain part of the ruling Awami League's student wing, Sheikh Hasina said, "We don't want to see 'uncles' in Chhatra League anymore." The prime minister made the comments when speaking with local MPs, party leaders and elites at the Sylhet Circut House on Saturday. Hasina also warned that she would not tolerate extortion or clashes over government tenders. She called upon party leaders and workers to engage in politics with the spirit of sacrifice. The Awami League president also asked them to remain vigilant about infiltration by Chhatra Dal and Chhatra Shibir exploiting Awami League's bid for recruiting more students. The government was working to strengthen its local bodies, she said adding that upazila and district councils would be made effective through decentralisation of administration. The prime minister stressed the need for expanding Sylhet as a divisional headquarter. She assured of setting up two government schools in Sylhet and government high schools in each upazila of the division. The programme chaired by city mayor Badruddin Ahmed Kamran was also attended by finance minister AMA Muhith, education minister Nurul Islam Nahid and chief whip Abdus Shahid. Earlier in the morning, the prime minister inaugurated a 51MW power plant installed under private initiative. bdne
