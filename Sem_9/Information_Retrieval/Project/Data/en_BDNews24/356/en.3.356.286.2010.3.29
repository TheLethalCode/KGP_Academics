 Dhaka, Mar 29 (bdnews24.com) -- Simon Katich hit his 10th Test century as Australia dominated day three of the second Test against New Zealand on Monday, reports BBC Sport. The opener shared productive stands with Shane Watson (65) and Mike Hussey (67) as the tourists ended the day on 333-4, a lead of 300 in Hamilton. Although muted in the morning session, Katich cut loose after lunch, reaching his century before he was caught behind off Brett Arnel (2-43) for 106. Michael Clarke and Marcus North were unbeaten on 42 at the end of the day. The fifth-wicket pair, who shared a 253-run partnership in Australia's comprehensive 10-wicket victory in Wellington in the first Test, put on 86 in the final session at Seddon Park. The day began slowly for Australia as Katich adopted a cautious strategy at a crucial juncture of an absorbing Test match. The left-hander eschewed most boundary-making opportunities in favour of stoic defence, preferring opening partner Shane Watson to score the majority of the runs in the morning session. Watson punished anything loose, bringing up his half-century with a straight-driven four off Tim Southee before hammering the very next ball for six. However, the seamer earned his revenge when Watson top-edged pull landed in the hands of BJ Watling at deep square leg, leaving Australia at 85-1. Watling was involved in Ponting's dismissal six runs later when the Australia captain clipped Southee to short mid-wicket. However, Katich and Hussey steadied the innings with an assured stand as the duo pushed the total beyond 200. Katich brought up his half-century just after lunch and gradually opened up from his defensive cocoon, smashing four boundaries in three overs off fast bowler Chris Martin. And he brought up his hundred with a wonderful drive outside off stump off the hapless Martin. Hussey had looked set for three figures but fell short when he edged a delivery from Southee from around the wicket to wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum. And Katich's 279-ball vigil ended soon after in an almost identical fashion, only this time off Arnel. But New Zealand's hopes of capitalising on quick wickets evaporated as Clarke and North took firm control. Australia vice-captain Clarke was particularly sharp off the back foot, while North maintained his superb form from the first Test, hitting seven boundaries and a six. The pair look set to add quick runs on Tuesday morning as Ponting eyes a sizeable lead and a 2-0 Test clean s
