 David Bergman Dhaka, Apr 3 (bdnews24.com)  The government has limited legal power to stop people leaving the country despite the home minister's claims that it can, senior lawyers say. The issue came to the fore after Mir Kashem Ali, a Jamaat-e-Islami leader and top war crimes suspect, left the country on March 24, just two days before home minister Sahara Khatun publicly said that the government would not allow "suspected war criminals" to exit Bangladesh. On March 25, the government set up a three-member tribunal along with a 7-member investigation agency and a 12-member prosecution team under the International Crimes (Tribunals) Act 1973. The lawyers also say that war crimes suspects cannot be arrested under ordinary police powers, and that suspects may only be detained once they have been charged by a tribunal judge after submission of an investigation report. This, they say, "could take quite some time." In the past six months, the High Court has ruled in at least five cases that the government's attempts to stop people leaving the country were unlawful. These include attempts to stop Jamaat-e-Islami leader Delwar Hossain Sayeedi, BNP leader Rasheduzzaman Millat, Faisal Morshed Khan, son of the former foreign minister and Amar Desh editor Mahmudur Rahman. Advocate Anisul Huq, the chief state counsel in the prosecution of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's killers, told bdnews24.com that a constitutional provision protected an individual's right to leave the country. He quoted Article 36 of the Constitution, which says that "subject to any reasonable restriction imposed by law in the public interest" every citizen has the right to "leave and re-enter Bangladesh." In relation to suspected war criminals, Huq said that it was "a bit premature" now for the government to consider that it has sufficient evidence to satisfy the court that the movement of those alleged to have committed war crimes should be restricted. There is "too much talk," from the government, he added. "To be honest, I would expect much more seriousness from the government in dealing with these (war crimes) cases." Khondaker Mahbub Hossain, who was chief prosecutor of the trials under the 1972 Collaborators Ordinance, says that Article 36 effectively means that the government can only restrict someone's movement if a case has been filed against that person and there is an apprehension that he may abscond. He says that the government's reported exit-control list given to immigration officers "is completely unlawful," if it includes people who have no case against them. One way the government could prevent suspected war criminals from leaving Bangladesh is by first arresting or detaining them. However, at present, this may not be straightforward either. Section 54 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) allows a police officer to arrest any person where the officer has a "reasonable suspicion" that the person has committed an offence. This section gives the police very wide discretion to arrest  but according to Anisul Huq, this power cannot be used to arrest suspected war criminals. "The 1973 Act clearly states that the CrPC will not be applicable to this trial," he told bdnews24.com Huq says that the Act itself sets out the specific circumstances under which a war crimes suspect can be detained for an offence. "Only a member of the tribunal  meaning one of the three judges appointed by the government  can issue a warrant for someone's arrest, and this can only happen if that person has first been charged with an offence under the Act." A tribunal judge can't however simply just arrest a person. "First, there must be an investigation by the appointed police investigators, who will then submit a report to the magistrate. The tribunal members will then consider whether there is sufficient evidence to charge." "It is only once the tribunal has charged a person that he or she can be detained," Huq said. It could be quite a long time before anyone is detained under the Act, Huq added. However, a senior lawyer in the attorney general's office, not wishing to be named, told bdnews24.com that the government could always prevent war crimes suspects from leaving the country by "arresting them under the CrPC for suspicion of committing an unnamed offence, detaining them under the Special Powers Act 1974, or even impounding their passport." "In the end, the courts will find the arrest or detention or passport confiscation unlawful and unjustified, but it will buy the government time." When the prosecutor was asked whether it was appropriate for the government to knowingly involve itself in unlawful arrests or detention, he said: "What else can the government do. We can't have all the war crimes suspects just leaving Bangladesh. We've to do something to keep them in the country."
