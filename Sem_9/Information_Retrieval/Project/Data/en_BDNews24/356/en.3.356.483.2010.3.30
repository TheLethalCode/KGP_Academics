 Dhaka, March 29 (bdnews24.com)  The government is set to formulate contingency plans for potential cyber attacks. Two new committees have been formed following a meeting organised on Monday by the 'Access to Information' (A2I) programme involving IT experts in the private and government sector. The meeting included about 15 experts from banks, universities, IT audit companies, and BUET. One committee will formulate a guideline for all government websites and all government related IT projects based on international practice. The other committee is to develop a response strategy setting out what the government should do If its websites come under attack. S M Akash, media and communication manager of the A2I programme told bdnews24.com that these two 'Primary Committees' will put forward suggestions to the government on necessary policy required for cyber security and on emergency action plan in case of any cyber attack. Monday's meeting took place following an incident on March 20 when 19 district web portals were hacked into by a computer linked to the Indian ISP provider, VSNL. The hacker, identifying himself as "EMIL INDIAN HACKER", threatened "cyber war" in retaliation to any terrorist attack by Pakistan on Indian soil "via Bangladesh". The hacked portals displayed a poster on opening, which said: 28 DIFFERENT STATES, 28 DIFFERENT LANGUAGES BUT ONE WORD JAI HIND!
