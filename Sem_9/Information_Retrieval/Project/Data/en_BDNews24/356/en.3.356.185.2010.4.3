 Dhaka, Apri 3 (bdnews24.com)  The Rapid Action Battalion has arrested a top leader of the militant Jamaatul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), along with six more of his party members. The elite crime fighting unit on Saturday morning said at a press conference that they had made the arrest from Phulbaria in Mymensingh. According to RAB, one Md Abdul Malek, alias Musa, Shajib or Robin, 27, was a member of the militant outfit's top decision making body, the 'majlish-e-shura'. The other JMB members who were arrested are Md Ahsan Zahir Khan, 35, in charge of Kishoreganj area, Md Faruk Hossain also known as Faruk Ahmed or 'butcher' Faruk, 38, Md Aminul Islam, 36, Md Abdul Halim, 35, Rafikul Islam alias Abdullah, 20 and Shahidulla, 38. The battalion members said that the seven had come to Phulbaria to join a wedding where they were actually suppose to hold a secret meeting. The RAB had also confiscated 26 books on militancy from them. The radical Islamist outfit, JMB, first made headlines with a series of explosions on August 17, 2005 when they set off bombs in 63 of the 64 districts of Bangladesh. Subsequently the law enforcers arrested almost the entire JMB leadership. The outfit was substantially weakened after 6 of the top JMP leaders were hanged. However, it is widely perceived that the organisation still continues to exist. On Saturday's press briefing the RAB's legal affairs and public relations director, commander Mohammad Sohail said as much. "They have become very weak and are trying to recruit new cadres.
