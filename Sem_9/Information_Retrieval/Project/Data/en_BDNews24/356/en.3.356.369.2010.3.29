Price and his two colleaguesStephen F Lynch and Jeff Fortenberrysaw prime minister Sheikh Hasina, leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia, speaker Abdul Hamid, deputy Speaker Col Shawkat Ali, foreign minister Dipu Moni and commerce minister Faruk Khan. "Bangladesh has made great strides in promoting democratic practices. We know that there are challenges (ahead)," Price told reporters at the parliament's media centre after meeting foreign minister and commerce minister.
