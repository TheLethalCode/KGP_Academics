<TEXT>
 Dinajpur, Apr 2 (bdnews24.com)  Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed on Friday said the issue of war crimes had been settled a long time ago. Jamaat assistant secretary general ATM Azharul Islam threatened to paralyse the entire country if one more party leader were arrested or harassed. Addressing a conference of the party's majlish-e-sura of eight northern districts in Dinajpur, he said: "War crime is a settled issue, as Shiekh Mujibur Rahman had solved it on April 9 in 1974." On that day, Bangladesh's founding president sent a number of Pakistani army personnel, who were alleged to have committed wear crimes, back to that country after an investigation. Mojaheed said: "There is no precedence in the world of charging non-military persons with war crimes and trying them." His comment came against the backdrop of government's preparation for trial of war crimes perpetrated during Bangladesh's Liberation War in 1971. The current top leadership of the fundamentalist Jamaat had allegedly collaborated with the Pakistani occupation forces during the war. Mojaheed said: "Many contestants in the last general elections would have lost miserably had the Awami League announced that it would try Jamaat leaders for war crimes." He said they supported the Awami League during the movement to topple military dictator Gen. Ershad. "Now we've become their enemy as we're with the BNP." He said either Awami League has failed to run the state affairs or do not have the "state-running remote control" in their hands. Mojaheed said Awami League is scared of Jamaat-e Islami. "That's why they've imposed section 144 at the venue of our conference." Because of the imposition of section 144, Jamat was forced to hold the conference at its party office in the district town instead of the two scheduled venues at Chauliapatti roundabout and Pubic Administration Institute. Police said they had to do it in order to prevent a clash as the local Muktijoddha Sangsad also convened a meeting there at the same time. He challenged the government saying: "Withdraw the section 144 and then see who can hold the rally." Jamaat assistant secretary general ATM Azharul Islam said Awami League is talking about pursuing democracy, upholding human rights and making Bangladesh a digital nation, but they are violating democracy, human rights and Constitution by obstructing holding of meeting by a Election Commission-enlisted politicalparty. "The country will be paralyzed through agitation programmes if the government arrests any more leader of our party," he warned. REST HOUSE VANDALISED A rest house in Dinajpur, where a Mujahid was scheduled to stay, was vandalised by a group of youths. The rest house of a blood transfusion centre named after Tayeba Majumder, mother of BNP chairperson and former prime minister Khaleda Zia. Ahsan Ali, superintendent of the centre, told bdnews24com that about 20-22 youths riding motorcycles entered the compounds at around noon chanting "Joy Bangla, Joy Bangabandhu". They threw stones indiscriminately, damaging its widows and glass doors, and left the scene in 10 minutes, he said. Asked about the reason for the attack, he said the rest house of the centre was booked for Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mojaheed , who was visiting Dinajpur. "That might be the cause. But he did not stay here." Ahsan said 2/3 Jamaat men stayed at the rest house at night and left at around 10am, well before the attack. bd
