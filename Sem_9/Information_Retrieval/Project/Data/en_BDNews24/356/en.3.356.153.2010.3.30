 YANGON, Mar 30, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An election boycott by democracy icon Aung San Suu Ki's party is a gamble that could backfire, some Myanmarese in the country's largest city said on Tuesday, though others backed the move. Members of the National League for Democracy party (NLD) voted unanimously on Monday to skip the country's first election in two decades to send out a strong message that the army-orchestrated political process was "unjust" and "unfair". But some said an opt-out by democracy's brightest ray of hope in the junta-ruled country was foolhardy and played into the hands of power-hungry generals. "I'm so sorry the NLD used their hearts, not their heads. It was an irretrievable policy blunder," said a high school headmaster in Yangon. "The whole nation will regret this. It shows the NLD are not qualified politicians. They lack the guts to go ahead without Aung San Suu Kyi." Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize winner who has been detained for 15 of the past 21 years because of her pro-democracy fight, said last week she "would not dream" of registering the NLD for the election.

"I doubt the NLD will be able to carry out any political activities after its dissolution. They could have tried to include her in the party after her release," he said. Yangon resident Kyaw Win, 65, believed the laws were unfair but criticised the NLD for rejecting a rare chance to become a stakeholder in the country's future. "Everybody would have voted for the NLD, with or without Aung San Suu Kyi. We all know this party is hers," he said. Fruit stall owner Than Than, 42, said he fully supported the boycott, but admitted there were few options remaining for the Burmese people now that the only viable alternative to army rule was out of the equation. "I couldn't agree with the NLD's decision more," he said. "But I just don't know who to vote for now in upcoming elections without the N
