 Dhaka, Apr 3 (bdnews24.com)  Speakers at a conference pro-BNP and pro-Jamaat journalists criticised the oppression of the media personnel during the tenure of the current government. The journalists also presented a list of their demands amid the government's criticism and gave an ultimatum to the government. Newly elected president of Supreme Court Bar Association Khandaker Mahbub Hossain urged everyone to resist the quarters oppressing journalists, instead of merely protesting against them. We must stand up wherever there is violation of human rights, said Hossain addressing a conference of pro-BNP and pro-Jamaat journalists at the National Press Club on Saturday. Mahboob said that a committee would be formed in every district to offer legal aid to those oppressed. "If anyone doesn't get justice from the lower courts, one has to be given legal aid for moving the High Court." His comment came after several suits were filed against the acting editor of Bengali daily Amar Desh, Mahmudur Rahman, and National Press Club president Shaukat Mahmud. Rahman was sued for running reports in his newspaper alleging prime minister Sheikh Hasina's son Sajib Ahmad Wazed of taking bribe from a US-based oil giant to favour it in a government bid. Mahmud was sued for reportedly threatening to crush the prime minister's hand at a BNP meeting in Cox's Bazar. Describing the ruling Awami League as a fascist and oppressive party, he said: "Bangabandhu had himself buried Awami League. He formed the BKSL dissolving Awami League." Pro-BNP and pro-Jamaat faction of Bangladesh Federal Union of Journalists (BFUJ) and Dhaka Union of Journalists (DUJ) organised the conference. Shaukat Mahmood presented a five-page declaration at the conference, presided over by BFUJ president Ruhul Amin Gazi. The declaration was adopted unanimously. Journalist leaders gave the government until June 15 this year to stop harassment of journalists, ensure arrest of the oppressors and full implementation of the Seventh Wage Board in all media outlets. They threatened to launch strong agitation programmes from June 16 if their demands were not met. The declaration demanded measures to stop oppression of journalists, withdrawal of cases against them, compensation to the dead journalists, and fair trial of cases involving injured journalists or murdered journalists. It protested the dismissal of journalists from the state-run Bangladesh Television, Bangladesh Radio and Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha. Former advisory editor of Amar Desh, Ataus Samad, urged all to protest every incident of journalist oppression. He said: "The occupation forces attacked the National Press Club in 1971. But we were not scared. We're not scared today either. We will continue to work for national interest." Samad said: "It was the journalist community which turned Sheikh Mujib into Bangabandhu." He said that one of the reasons that Sheikh Mujib appeared as a national leader was because of journalists. "Following Agartala Conspiracy case, he requested Maulana Bhasani through journalists to wage anti-Pakistan movement." Mahmudur Rahman, the News Today editor Reazuddin Ahmed, BFUJ secretary general MA Aziz, press club general secretary Kamaluddin Sabuj, Doctors Association of Bangladesh secretary general AKM Zahid Hossain, Dhaka University prof Sadrul Amin also addressed the conference.
