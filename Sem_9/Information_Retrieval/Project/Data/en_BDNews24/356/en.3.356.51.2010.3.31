 Dhaka, Mar 30 (bdnews24.com)The government's decision to prioritise the supply of electricity to the villages over the cities was taken to control the prices of essentials, finance minister AMA Muhith said Tuesday. This measure was intended to help support food production, he said at a meeting on the import of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) at the finance ministry. The government on Monday decided to halt gas supply to five major fertiliser companies so that it can be used to supply power plants which can then generate more electricity Muhith said, "Irrigation in the current Boro season would be hampered if there was no electricity in the rural areas. Production will fall, which could result in a shortage of foodstuffs. "Since the prices of foods have risen already, we need to control them," he added. The overall inflation rate in the country is 8.99 percent, while prices in the food sector have risen by10.56 percent, according to the latest statistics of Bangaldesh Bureau of Statistics. The participants at the meeting  which included the state minister for power, energy and minerals, and the prime minister's advisor for energy and power Tawfik-e Elahi Chowdhury - agreed with the presentation that set out the advantages of importing LNG. Other participants included the Bangladesh Energy Regularity Commission chairman Syed Yusuf Hossain, and Petrobangla chairman Hossain Monsoor, finance secretary Mohammad Tareq. Muhith also suggested that there should be a hike in electricity and gas prices in order to reduce government subsidies in these sectors. He also said that cost of electricity generation was too high. However, the government in the beginning of March already raised the electricity prices for retail consumers by 6-7 percent and price of gas was raised in October 2008. Citing electricity and gas crises as the major problems, Muhith said, "We need to import LNG. The coal policy must also be finalised as soon as possible." The minister also said that price of CNG should be raised, saying that "there has been no reduction in the number of vehicles in the streets as the price of CNG is cheap. "The imports of cars did not fall despite an increasing the level of tax," he added. bdnews2
