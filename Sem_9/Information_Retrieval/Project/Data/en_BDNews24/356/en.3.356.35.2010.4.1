 VATICAN CITY, Apr 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Vatican attacked The New York Times on Wednesday for its coverage of the sexual abuse of children by priests, rejecting accusations that Pope Benedict had mishandled a series of abuse cases before he was elected. Signaling it had decided to take the gloves off in its reaction to coverage of sexual abuse, a Vatican statement referred specifically to two reporters and a columnist. (http:/www.vatican.va/resources/resources_card-levada2010_en.html) "I ask the Times to reconsider its attack mode about Pope Benedict XVI and give the world a more balanced view of a leader it can and should count on," said the 20-paragraph statement written by Cardinal William J.

The statement offered a detailed criticism of the Times' coverage of the affair as well as an equally detailed defense of the pope, who Levada said had done much even before his election to change the way the church views cases of sexual abuse. Earlier on Wednesday, conservative Catholic university students from the Opus Dei group rushed to the pope's defense, attacking journalists who have written about the sexual abuse of children by priests as "sowers of mistrust." The some 4,000 students from around the world, in Rome for a convention, handed the beleaguered pope a letter of support during his weekly general audience in St Peter's Square. In his address, the pope made no direct reference to the scandal sweeping the church but said priests should always send a message of "hope, reconciliation and peac
