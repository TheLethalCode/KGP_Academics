<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 30 (bdnews24.com)  Drik gallery has filed a petition with the High Court challenging the closure by the police of its Crossfire photo exhibition. Shaidul Alam, the photographer and Drik's managing director filed the petition on Tuesday seeking a High Court order declaring the closure illegal and a direction to the government to allow the exhibition to take place. A brief hearing on the petition took place in the bench of justice Md Shahidul Islam. Barrister Sara Hossain argued for the petition while additional attorney general Murad Reza acted for the government. Reza argued that the gallery needed prior permission to open an exhibition, and sought time from the court so that it could show it under which law permission was required. The court adjourned the hearing until Wednesday. The home secretary, inspector general of police, director general of RAB, Dhaka Metropolitan police commissioner and Dhanmondi police chief are the named as respondents in the petition. Police on Mar 22 closed down the gallery in the capital after it refused to cancel the show of images relating to deaths by RAB 'crossfire', a euphemism for extra-judicial killings. bd
