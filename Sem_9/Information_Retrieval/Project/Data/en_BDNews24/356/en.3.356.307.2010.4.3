 LONDON, Apr 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - David Haye has total respect for challenger John Ruiz ahead of Saturday's WBA world heavyweight clash which explains the absence of feisty exchanges and clever back-chat but the Briton says he will knock him out. "It's always my plan to knock out my opponents... I don't believe there is anyone in the world who can take the punishment I am willing to dish out for 12 rounds," he told reporters. In only his fourth heavyweight fight, Haye makes his first title defence at Manchester's MEN Arena against an American aiming to join Muhammad Ali and Evander Holyfield as the only men to become three-time world heavyweight champions. "David's got more respect for John Ruiz then anybody he has boxed ever, which is why there is no need for trash talk," Haye's manager Adam Booth told a news conference ahead of the first heavyweight world title fight in Britain for 10 years. Ruiz, who has won all six of his previous fights in Britain, held the title from March 2001-March 2003 and February 2004-December 2005. Haye, who once wore a T-shirt showing the severed heads of Klitschko brothers Vladimir and Vitali and also labelled giant Russian Nikolai Valuev a "circus freak" before taking his WBA crown in November, has been more reserved in this build-up. "Ruiz does his talking in the ring, I am aware of that, so it's a waste of time to give it too much verbal," Haye said. SHUNNED Ruiz, known as 'The Quietman,' lived up to his nickname when he failed to attend the fight announcement in January and hardly blinked on Thursday when Haye proclaimed he would knock him out. "I feel at this moment I am complete... that's when you realise you are on top of the world and that is what I am here to prove," Ruiz (44-8-1, 30KOs) said. This will be Ruiz's second fight under the tutelage of experienced trainer Miguel Diaz, who has led Erik Morales to a world title and worked with Miguel Cotto, and the pair have targeted a pace of more than 50 punches a round with Haye. The 38-year-old American is known to stay close to his opponent and, with both fighters of similar size, Haye is expecting a battle that could last a full 12 rounds. "I'm expecting a tough, gruelling fight. I have trained for 12 rounds or less and I want to make it less," Haye (23-1, 21KOs) said. The 29-year-old 'Hayemaker' from London, knows a convincing victory could lead to a much-talked of showdown with WBC champion Vitali Klitschko or his younger brother and WBO, IBF and IBO heavyweight champion, Vlad
