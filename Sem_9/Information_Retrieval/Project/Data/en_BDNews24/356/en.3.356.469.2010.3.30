<TITLE> Bangladesh Bank installs solar power </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 30 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Bank (BB) has installed a solar system on the rooftop of it's main building to reduce pressure on the demand for electricity. The central bank governor Atiur Rahman inaugurated the launch of the solar system, which is installed at a cost of more than Tk 1 crore on Tuesday. The solar system comprising 116 panels will provide electricity for 171 lights at the governor's office, one guest room, board room and the main conference room during the day, and boundary wall lighting at night. The solar system, expected to last about 20 years, has an 8 kilowatt capacity. The governor said that use of solar energy in domestic and offices can reduce pressure on national grid and can directly help in protecting the environment. He also said that the central bank will consider providing lone facility for its staff to install solar system for domestic use. The country produces 3500-4200 MW of electricity against a daily demand for 4000-5200 MW on average, according to official estimates. The government has decided to stop fertiliser production temporarily in the country to divert natural gas to the power plants. Frequent power failures cut the country's gross domestic product by around $1 billion annually, the World Bank has said. The country would need $1.5 billion annual investment for power generation and transmission, and natural gas exploration, according to official estimates. Use of solar energy can be an alternative source for electricity, says an expert from Grameen Shakti. However, the cost of the Bangladesh Bank solar project, which stands at Tk 13,495,000, when scaled up is over 20 times more expensive than conventional power production, which costs around $1 million per megawatt capacity in terms of set up of fossil-fuel based power plants
