<TEXT>
 Bogra, April 1 (bdnews24.com)  Jamaat-e-Islami called upon its members to prepare for ultimate sacrifice through martyrdom. Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mojaheed, secretary general of the fundamentalist party, told a party meeting in Bogra on Thursday that they would have to rid themselves of their weaknesses. "One must be ready to embrace martyrdom without hesitation." In the context of a war crimes tribunal process advancing on the back of strong government resolve, Mojaheed gave his party men four recommendations. He said that activists should remain loyal to the party under all circumstances. Mojaheed told Jamaat men that preparations had to be taken within the organisation as well as within their families. This former social welfare minister said that the men should have strong faith on the almighty above all because only that could deliver them. "Attacks and lawsuits will not be enough to stop Jamaat." Earlier on March 31 Mojaheed told the press in Dhaka that no Jamaat leader was involved in any war crime during the Liberation War in 1971 and there is no way they may be labelled as 'war criminals'. He also declared to continue legal battle against the war crime charges. Mojaheed claimed that India was instigating the government to go after Jamaat, which is also a major ally of the main opposition BNP. "India apprehends that only the military and the Jamaat could prevent Bangladesh from becoming a proxy for India." bdnews2
