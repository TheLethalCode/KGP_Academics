<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 2 (bdnews24.com)Relatives of two newborns and one infant who died in a hospital on Friday claimed the deaths occurred because of a power outage. Officials of the Institute of Child and Mother Health at Matuail, outside Dhaka, and police, however, said the deaths were natural. Relatives alleged that the children had died there as there was no power and the hospital's generator was not working. Father of three-month old Hasan, was reportedly running around the hospital searching for oxygen on Friday morning. But M A Tahir failed. His son died at 10:45am. He told bdnews24.com that the generator had been out of order for the last few days. Denying the allegations that the children had died due to power shortage, the hospital director Shahnewaz Bin Sabib, claimed when speaking to bdnews24.com, "Oxygen is always available in the hospital." However, he could not confirm whether the hospital's generator was working. Sub inspector of Kadamtali Police Station, Nijhum Roy, said the police went to the hospital to investigate the matter after receiving complaints. Quoting the hospital authorities, he said the infants had natural deaths and there were no grounds for complaints. bdnews2
