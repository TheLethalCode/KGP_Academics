 Kamran Reza Chowdury Dhaka, March 31 (bdnews24.com)--Eighteen Bhutanese products are set to get duty free access to Bangladesh in a day or two, commerce minister Faruk Khan said Wednesday. The minister said people in Bangladesh would be able to consume winter vegetables such as cauliflower and cabbages imported from Bhutan this summer. Under the arrangement, Bhutan will be able to export fresh and chilled vegetables, pulses, cardamom, ginger, fresh fruits, jam, fruit juices, mineral water, limestone, gypsum, calcium carbonate, particle board, ferro-silicon, semi-finished products of iron, non-alloy steel and others without export duty. "This will result in reduction of prices of fruits, fruit products, vegetables and others," said Khan. In Bhutan, vegetables grow in abundance during June-July when most of the cultivable land goes under water in Bangladesh. "Thus, we can get winter vegetables at affordable prices in the summer," the minister said. Khan said Thimpu got the facility considering "our friendship with Bhutan". Prime minister Sheikh Hasina during her visit to Bhutan in November last year declared giving 18 Bhutanese products (having highest 15 percent duty) duty-free access. Bhutan has been giving Bangladesh almost duty-free access to such products as garments, computer accessories, dry foods, pharmaceuticals and toiletries. Bangladesh's exports to Bhutan total less than $1 million, while Bhutan's exports to Bangladesh stand at around $14 million, according to the commerce ministry figures. Bhutan's main export items are mineral products, foodstuffs, fruits, beverages and oats. Commerce ministry officials say, the Bhutanese goods-laden trucks will reach warehouses at Burimari and Tamabil land port stations via India. At present, Burimari is the nearest land port from Bhutan-India border, which is just over 70 kilometres from Burimari border. A senior commerce ministry official told bdnews24.com Bhutan has requested Bangladesh to open one more land port along Bangladesh-India border in Nakugaon in Sherpur. Bangladesh is yet to discuss Bhutan's request with India, he said
