 LONDON, Mar 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A shared footballing philosophy does not guarantee a classic when Barcelona meet Arsenal in the Champions League on Wednesday, with the visitors likely to take a more pragmatic approach than their reputation may suggest. Barca coach Pep Guardiola spoke on the eve of the quarter-final first leg with his usual enthusiasm about Arsene Wenger's achievements during his long tenure in the Arsenal job. Guardiola sounded perfectly genuine as he envisaged a spectacle worthy of the reputations of two clubs renowned for attacking football played with pace and guile. As usual, however, the devil was in the detail. The 39-year-old Catalan, who masterminded Barcelona's European Cup success in his first season in charge, is not about to sacrifice the trophy in the pursuit of pure football.

"He's very important -- someone who can play in different positions, is good one-on-one and a smart player who keeps the ball better than anyone." Otherwise, Guardiola has few concerns. Lionel Messi is in a state of grace, as the Spanish say, and his biggest problem may be whether to give former Arsenal forward Thierry Henry a place in the forward line with the Argentine and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Arsenal also have an injury concern over Cesc Fabregas and while Guardiola is full of admiration for a player who came through the Barcelona youth set-up, and looked up to the current coach as a major inspiration, he knows Arsenal are far from reliant on the dynamic young midfielder. "I assume they are a better player with him," Guardiola said. "But remember, they beat Porto 5-0 without
