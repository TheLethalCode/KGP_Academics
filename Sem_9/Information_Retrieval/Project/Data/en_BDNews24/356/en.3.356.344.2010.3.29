<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 29 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chief and leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia has said that attempts were made to send her abroad forcibly by injecting her with "sleeping drugs" during the caretaker government regime. She made the claim on Monday while addressing a rally in Laldighi Maidan in Chittagong, which marks the beginning of BNP's countrywide mass communication tour. The allegation also comes on the heels of prime minister Sheikh Hasina's claim of "slow poisoning" in special jail under the past caretaker government. The opposition leader asked all to launch movements against the government from Chittagong. It also marks the opposition leader's first public speech in the city since the Dec 29, 2008 national elections. Referring to the chief adviser and army chief who were virtually in charge of the country during the two-year tenure of a military-controlled interim government, Khaleda said, "Fakhruddin and Moeen Uddin ruined the country." The BNP chief's convoy - which includes BNP vice president Selima Rahman - left her Dhaka Cantonment house Monday morning. BNP standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, speaking from Chittagong, told bdnews24.com that the party is launching its programme of political rallies in each division from Chittagong, since former president Ziaur Rahman, the party's founder, "declared Bangladesh's independence of in 1971 from there". The issue has become a contentious one since the Awami League government has warned against public statements going against a High Court ruling last year that said Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was the "declarer of independence". The BNP is due to hold a grand rally in Dhaka's Paltan Maidan after holding mass rallies in the six divisions. b
