 Dhaka, Apr 4 (bdnews24.com)  Water resource minister Ramesh Chandra Sen announced on Sunday an initiative to help solve Dhaka metropolitan's prevailing water crisis by bringing water from the Jamuna River to the Buriganga River "Through dredging the rivers between the Jamuna and Dhaleshwari Rivers, we will be able to bring water to the Buriganga River before the end of the year," the minister said to journalists at a seminar titled 'Role of River Research Institute and its future plan' held at theWater Development Board's conference room in Motijheel. "Eight dredgers are being bought from Qatar and nine from India for this purpose. We will dredge the rivers under our own management and hold water in the Buriganga River", Sen said. Many areas of the capital are suffering from a water crisis and the WASA authority has pointed the finger at insufficient power supply as the key reason. The minister concurred that the power deficit is the key reason behind the water deficit. "During the seven years of the former governments not a single megawatt of power was added to the grid. Instead Tk 20-50 thousand crores was spent on erecting power poles," he said. Through the current emphasis on power production, "It will be possible to bring down the shortfall between power supply and demand to a satisfactory level within the next six months." Responding to a query on the continuing dumping of waste into the Buriganga River, the minister said "The factories have been instructed to not dump wastes into the river. In addition, the initiative has also been taken to shift the tannery industry to Savar." Addressing the view of many experts that underground water levels have lowered because of Dhaka WASA's use of deep tube wells, the minister said, "Embankment constructions are needed at various points to hold surface water. This will ensure that the ground reserves are filled and it will be possible to give sufficient water supply." He also said that plans have been taken to work jointly with neighbouring countries in solving the water crisis. The main paper at the workshop was presented by the River Research Institute's chief scientist Swapan Kumar Das. The seminar was attended by water resource state minister Md Mahbubur Rahman, water development board director general Habibur Rahman and others. bdnews2
