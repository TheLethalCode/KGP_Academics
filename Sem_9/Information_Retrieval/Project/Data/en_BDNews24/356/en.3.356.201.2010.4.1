 Dhaka, April 1 (bdnews24.com)  The army will be deployed from Arpil 7 to guard WASA pumps in Dhaka contrary to what LGRD minister Syed Ashraful Islam said March 31. He had said that military deployment would come into effect from April 1. Golam Mostafa, chairman of the Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority, said that army was supposed to be deployed from Thursday but the army informed the water agency that deployment would be possible from April 7. He told bdnews24.com in an interview on March 29 that there was water shortage everywhere and thus, to avoid untoward situation around the city, the water agency would resort to army deployment like every year. Mostafa said that the problem would be alleviated if rains came within a month. "The army will be withdrawn once the situation improves," he added. There are 546 pumps under Dhaka WASA's 10 zonal offices including that under Narayanganj zone. Among these, 293 pumps are run by generators. The WASA chairman said that if all the pumps could be run by generators, without depending on power supply and availability, the water shortage could easily be resolved. He said that out of Dhaka city's daily water demand of 220, WASA could only produce 190 crore litres. bd
