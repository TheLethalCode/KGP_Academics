 Dhaka, Apr 4 (bdnews24.com) The government has agreed to deploy a 'striking and mobile force' in Bhola from Apr 21 comprising RAB and armed police for the upcoming Bhola  3 constituency elections. Home secretary Abdus Sobhan Shikder made the statement following a meeting between the election commission (EC) and law enforcers on Sunday. However, the EC decided not to deploy the army during the polls despite requests by the opposition BNP. "According to local reports, there appears to be no probability of troubles during the polls. So we have not decided yet to deploy the army," chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said The meeting presided over by the chief election commissioner was attended by the two election commissioners, commission secretary, high-level representatives of the law and order enforcers, including the police's inspector general, and the district administration of Bhola. Responding to a journalist's query, the home secretary said, "Sufficient number of law enforcers will be deployed to ensure that a free and fair poll is held. The mobile force will be deployed between Apr 21 to Apr 25. In addition, armed law enforcers will be on duty at the poll centres between Apr 23 and 25." "A police sub inspector will lead a team of 24 police, Ansar and VDP members armed with firearms and batons in order to secure the poll centres. An executive magistrate will lead the striking and mobile force" Shikder said.. In accordance with election law, a mobile court led by a judicial magistrate can be formed to hold summary trials on the election day. Addressing the preparations for the 'risky' poll centres, he said "Election commissioners will go to Bhola and be present at the risky centres during the poll. Close-circuit TV cameras will also be placed at these centres." A total of 2,23,926 voters will elect their representative at 86 poll centres in the constituency on Apr 24. BNP's Hafizuddin Ahmed and Al's Nurunnabi Chowdhury Shaon have received final nominations from the respective parties. However, former AL candidate Md Jashimuddin has not yet withdrawn and is still on the list of contenders. The last day of withdrawing from the polls is Apr 8. Poll publicity regulations The election commission has already urged the prime minister to issue directives asking government ministers, state ministers, deputy-ministers or anyone of the same level to refrain from participating in poll publicity campaigns. The EC also urged the speaker to ask members of parliament to do the same. bd
