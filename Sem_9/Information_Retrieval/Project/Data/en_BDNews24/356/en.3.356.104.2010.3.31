 Dhaka, Mar 31 (bdnews24.com) -- Promising wicketkeeper-batsman Dinesh Chandimal is the only uncapped player in Sri Lanka's 15-member squad for the ICC World Twenty20. Kumar Sangakkara will lead their campaign in the West Indies, and Muttiah Muralitharan will be his deputy, reports Cricinfo. Chandimal, 20, has risen in prominence in recent times and has a batting average of 31.62 in 17 domestic Twenty20 matches. He scored a century for Ruhuna last week, against Basnahira North in the SLC inter-provincial tournament. All-rounder Thissara Perera, who has played six ODIs, has also been included in the squad. Dilhara Fernando, Kaushalya Weeraratne and Muthumudalige Pushpakumara were axed from the side that contested the two-match Twenty20 series against India in December. Sri Lanka play New Zealand in the tournament's opening match on April 30, and Zimbabwe on May 3.
