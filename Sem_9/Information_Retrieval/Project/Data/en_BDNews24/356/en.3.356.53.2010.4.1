 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury Dhaka, Mar 31(bdnews24.com) --- The Election Commission is ready to introduce electronic voting in the country for the first time during Dhaka city elections slated for May. It will pilot e-voting in one ward during the upcoming DCC polls. If the pilot project proves successful, the EC will consider introducing the system first in other local elections and possibly in the next general election, election officials have said. "The draft of the Electronic Voting Machine Guidelines 2010 has been sent to the law ministry so that we can introduce e-voting on an experimental basis in Ward 49 in the DCC election," election commissioner Muhammad Sohul Hussain told bdnews24.com on Wednesday. The Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) will be available in time for the DCC election due in May, he said. Both the hardware and software used for the e-voting system is being made locally. The EC has signed a deal for the machines with BUET's Bureau of Research Training & Consultation. Prof SM Luful Kabir, director of BUET's Institute of Information & Communication Technology (IICT) first presented a report on EVMs to the EC back in 2007. "EVMs are being introduced to make the voting system easier, faster and more accurate," Kabir told bdnews24.com on Wednesday. "Neutrality will be maintained regarding vote casting and counting," he said adding that ordinary people will find the system acceptable. The manufacturing cost of each machine is estimated to be Tk 10,800 and if the process is started now, the system might be used in the next parliamentary election which will cut expenditure, Kabir said. Former adviser to the care-taker government Akbar Ali Khan told bdnews24.com, "Undoubtedly, e-voting is a preferable system and in the future manual voting will no longer be possible in Bangladesh." "Sooner or later the system will have to be introduced but the flaws of the system must be identified through experimental projects before applying it on a large scale," he said Neighbouring countries have introduced e-voting and some Bangladesh organisations use the system to elect their leaders. "The use of ballot paper and ballot boxes are expensive. In addition, allegations are rampant in the present voting system," election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain told bdnews24.com. "So we must move towards an e-voting system in the coming days," he said, adding that they would talk with the political parties before introducing the system on a large scale. Political parties must understand the utility of e-voting and people must be made aware of the system, he said PILOT CASE IICT of BUET will manufacture and supply 130 EVM for conducting polls in Ward 49, Kabir said, "Each polling booth will require a single EVM and each centre will have an additional EVM on standby," he said, adding that as many as 122 EVMs would be needed for the election. "An additional 8 EVMs will be available to provide training to the officials, to show candidates and teach voters how to use them, "Kabir said Each voting machine will set out the names of 48 candidates, their photographs and symbols running for the Dhaka city mayor, ward councillor and female councillor. He said the system will be similar to the existing voting system except the vote is cast by pressing a switch. When the vote has been given correctly, the machine will say, 'Voting is correct' b
