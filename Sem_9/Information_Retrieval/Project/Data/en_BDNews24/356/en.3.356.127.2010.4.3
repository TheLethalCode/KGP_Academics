 Dhaka, Apr 3 (bdnews24.com)  State minister for science, information and communication, Yafes Osman has urged for increasing the use of renewable power to deal with the power crisis. Speaking at a seminar on the importance of renewable energy at Dhaka University on Saturday, Osman said, "The use of renewable energy has to increase to resolve the prevailing electricity shortage." "We have to build small plants for using renewable energy at every home. If it is possible, it will help save natural gas besides fulfilling electricity demands." He also urged scientists to step up and provide an alternative to solve the electricity problem. He said, "The nation desires something new from the scientists. They have to invent new technology as well as modernise old technology." Professor A A M S Arefin Siddique, the vice chancellor of Dhaka University said that about 4-4.50 kWh of solar energy per square metre falls in almost everywhere in the country. "It is possible to meet the power demand if that could be harnessed." Professor Mohammad Ibrahim, president of Bangladesh Solar Energy Association, Professor Rezaul Karim Majumdar, director of renewable energy research centre of Dhaka University and Professor Muhtasham Hossain also spoke at the seminar. A day-long national renewable energy exhibition was also held at Mokarram Building, adjacent to Dhaka University science library. b
