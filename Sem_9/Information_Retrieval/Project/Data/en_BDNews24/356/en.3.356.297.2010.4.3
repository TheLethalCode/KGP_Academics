<TEXT>
 Sylhet, Apr 3 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina said the government is working towards adding 3,000MW to the country's power generation capacity by 2013. The government has a target to generate 20,000MW by 2021, she said on Saturday. Hasina told a ceremony at the inauguration of a 51MW power plant at Fenchuganj that the government had already signed deals to set up power plants to generate 1,000MW. "Work orders for another 1,000MW will be given out within the next two months." The country's 44 power plants generate about 4,000MW a day on average against a peak demand of 5,300MW. Hasina said that steps had been taken to generate 5,000MW in the private sector. The government last month approved a Tk 7000 crore-project to generate 530MW. The prime minister said that the rural areas were being prioritised for power supply to assist irrigation of Boro crops. "We are depriving the people in Dhaka and braving their criticism for the benefit of the farmers." She called upon the expatriates for more investment in industries. "It is not possible for the government to implement all the power projects by itself," said Hasina and assured all kinds of facilities for the expatriates. She said that about 47 percent of the population have access to electricity and that power demand rose by 7 to 8 percent every year. The prime minister said that her government was going to initiate large projects. "These will reduce the power crisis in the short term and ensure power for all by 2020 in the longer term." Hasina criticised the BNP-led government of massive corruption in the name of setting up power plants. Referring to the BNP regime's programme of expanding distribution lines, allegedly through massive corruption, Hasina said, "All that the people got in the name of power were poles." Hasina said the government was considering to import power from the neighbouring countries including India, Nepal, Bhutan and Myanmar. "Technical experts of Bangladesh and India are working on power exchange projects between the two countries." The prime minister said the government has already taken up a project to install a transmission line from West Bengal's Bahrampur of India through Bangladesh's Bheramara. "We will get at least 250MW by the middle of 2012 from India." bd
