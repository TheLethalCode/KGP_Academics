<TEXT>
 Natore, Mar 30 (bdnews24.com)  Police recovered nearly two thousand pentavalent vaccines that were stolen from Natore's civil surgeon office and arrested three persons in this connection. The vaccines are used to immunise children aged between six months to five years against five potential killers -- diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), which causes some severe forms of pneumonia and meningitis. Abdul Hannan, Natore police's detective branch sub inspector, told bdnews24.com that they arrested a passenger, Abdus Samad, from a Sirajganj-bound bus based on secret information and recovered 300 Pentavalent vaccines from him. The DB official also said that they recovered another 1,400 vaccines from the house of Yunus Ali, the night guard of the civil surgeon office. Yunus was not at home at the time but his wife Saima Begum revealed that the vaccines were kept there by Shahidul Islam, a government medical officer, Hannan said. DB police arrested the store-keeper Fazlur Rahman based on information from Saima but could not apprehend Shahidul Alam who went into hiding. Samad, Rahman and Saima were shown arrested in this connection. He also said that police are probing into how such a large stock of vaccines was stolen from the government store. All associates, including Dr. Tulsi Rai, store in charge, will be questioned, the DB official said. Hannan said the vaccines stolen are worth around Tk 12 lakh. Civil surgeon Dr Mizanur Rahman confirmed the incident, saying, "Besides the police, I've formed a probe committee headed by Dr Tulsi Rai to investigate the incident. Departmental steps would be taken against the offenders." Responding to a query about the justification of appointing a suspect to head the probe, Dr. Rahman said, "She has been given the responsibility as there are no other doctors. However a magistrate is also there." The civil surgeon also said that the vaccines were recently imported by the government from South Korea and are not available in the open market. bd
