 Dhaka, Mar 30 (bdnews24.com) -- David Warner notched up the second century of the Indian Premier League as Delhi Daredevils bulldozed a hapless Kolkata Knight Riders by 40 runs on Monday, reports PTI. Riding on Warner's unbeaten 107 in 69 balls, the highest score of IPL 3, and Paul Collingwood's 45-ball 53, Delhi posted a competitive 177 for four and then restricted Kolkata at 137 for nine to register their first win at home and brighten their semi-final hopes. Chasing 178 to win, Kolkata lost too many wickets upfront and never looked to be in the chase. Chris Gayle (30) and David Hussey (29) top-scored for the Kolkata team but it was not enough as they lost half their side inside 100 runs. Earlier, Warner fired nine fours and five sixes and added 128 runs for the fourth wicket with Collingwood to resurrect the Delhi Daredevils innings after they were tottering at 38 for three at one stage. Andrew McDonald scalped three and Umesh Yadav picked up two wickets while Dirk Nannes, Rajat Bhatia, Amit Mishra and Collingwood accounted for one victin apiece to contribute in their team's win at the Feroze Shah Kotla Stadium. Kolkata were off to a bad start as they lost skipper Sourav Ganguly (5), Mandeep Singh (0) and last match's star Manoj Tiwary (0) in quick succession to be left tottering at 21 for three in 4.2 overs. Gayle tried to keep the scoreboard ticking and clobbered McDonald for a four and a six in the second over, before hitting him for a six and four in the fifth over. The West Indies opener, who was dropped by Virender Sehwag at 24, however, didn't last long as he gave a catch to Amit Mishra at deep mid-wicket off Rajat Bhatia in the ninth over to see Kolkata slip to 50 for four in 8.1 overs. David Hussey and Angelo Matthews (24) tried to resurrect the innings and stitched 35 runs off 32 balls but once the former was gone, defeat was evident for the Knight Riders. Earlier, electing to bat, Delhi had a shaky start as they lost three quick wickets -- Virender Sehwag (8), Gautam Gambhir (1) and Dinesh Karthik (0) -- within three overs but Warner played a devastating knock which was bejewelled with nine fours and five sixes to ensure a competitive score. The Australian, however, almost had a heartbreak at 96 when Murali Kartik pulled of a stunning catch off his own bowling in the 18th over but much to the dismay of the Kolkata team, the ball had kissed the ground as Warner got a life and went on to celebrate his century. For Kolkata, Gayle opened the bowling and after being hit for a couple of fours, dismissed the dangerous Sehwag. In pursuit of a six, the dashing right-hander was stumped by Saha as Delhi lost its first wicket in the opening over. Back in the side, Charl Langeveldt then got into the act and caught skipper Gambhir, who was playing his first match after recovering from injury, plumb in front of the wicket to reduce Delhi to 21 for two in two overs. Unfazed Warner continued his carnage on the other end and plundered two consecutive fours and a six off Ishant Sharma. The lanky pacer, however, came back strongly and dismissed newman Dinesh Karthik for duck in the last ball of the over. But Warner was in an unstoppable mood and the Australian picked up two more fours and a six off Langeveldt to bring up Delhi's fifty in 4.4 overs. Warner kept sending the bowlers for the leather hunt and reached his half-century with a four off Kartik. Kartik was again at the receiving end in the next over, when he heaved him over square leg. The diminutive Australian meted the same treatment to Ajit Agarkar and brought up the 100 for Delhi, before plundering 17 runs off his second over, which included two fours and a six over long off. Collingwood also blossomed in the final overs, clobbering two sixes off Gayle and it took a stunning catch by Hussey at the boundary line in the last over to dismiss the Englis
