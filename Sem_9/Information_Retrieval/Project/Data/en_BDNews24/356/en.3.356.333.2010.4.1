 Dhaka, April 1 (bdnews24.com)  Ruling party MPs expressed deep concern over rising prices of essentials at a meeting on Thursday. They warned that failure to control the trend of rising prices could lead to erosion of public confidence in the government. The warning came at a pre-budget discussion between finance minister AMA Muhith and members of parliament. The discussion at the NEC building also stressed upon solving the current power and energy crisis plaguing the country. Framework to implement the budget should be fixed before formulating the next budget, said Brahmanbaria MP Saidul Haque. He also said that the government should look into controlling prices of some key essential commodities like rice, flour, pulses, edible oil and sugar. "The common people are losing confidence in the government as we have failed to contain prices," added Haque. Lawmaker Amina Ahmed, who sits on the parliamentary standing committee on public undertaking, shared his concern. "One of the key factors of budget measures should be to contain food inflation." Shortage of gas, power and water is the main obstacle to investment, she added. Responding to the MPs' concern, finance minister Muhith said that the government was doing quite well in containing food prices. He, however, acknowledged that the government had "failed to control prices of sugar and pulses." On the issue of energy, he said that there was no alternative to importing LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) to meet the power crisis and it would take at least one and a half year to reap its benefits. "The benefits of a coal policy would be realised in four to five years." "The progress rate in the last nine months is magnificent and it has been done by the same bureaucracy which we often scold." Golam Dastagir Gazi, MP of Naraynganj, pointed out that the shortage of gas was the main reason behind the acute crisis of utility services. Gazi said that people would not mind a price-hike of gas and electricity, if the supply were uninterrupted. Distribution of power and energy should be managed well to meet the crisis, according to Mostafa Faruk Mohammad, an MP from Jessore. "The crisis is now at its peak as there were no efforts to raise production during the past regime and the demand rose by 10 to 12 percent annually," he added. LDP lawmaker Oli Ahmed focused on the need of hydro-electricity in the wake of the power crisis. He also stressed quick measures to mine the available coal reserve of the country. The lawmaker of Chittagong criticised the recent government decision to ban use of air-conditioners at peak hours saying that the common people should not be "punished". On the matter of budget implementation, Ahmed suggested a timeframe for ministries to implement their budget allocations. "The procurement process of the government should be completed by July and projects should take off by October." A quick decision on the issue of coal was also voiced in the discussion along with handling the population rise and greater emphasis on railways and waterways rather than roads as means of communications. The finance minister agreed that switching to railway and waterways needed to be considered seriously as Bangladesh has "the highest density of roads". Muhith sounded pretty confident about implementing the budget
