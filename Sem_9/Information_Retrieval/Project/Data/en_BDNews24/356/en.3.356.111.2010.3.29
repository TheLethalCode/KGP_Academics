 Chittagong, Mar 29 (bdnews24.com) -- BNP chairperson and leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia, addressing supporters in Chittagong on Monday, rallied party leaders and activists to prepare for an anti-government movement. "Today is a warm-up rehearsal. Get ready for movement," she told a grand rally at Chittagong Laldighi ground, her first since the December 2008 national election. She said her party, the main opposition, would launch the movement after holding a series of political rallies in each division to drum up support for an anti-government campaign. In her 66-minute address to a gathering of thousands at the port city, the first of the divisional rallies, Khaleda listed the "failures" of the Awami League-led government. "They've not fulfilled any (election) pledge made to the people. They're busy fulfilling commitments to foreigners." Khaleda termed the agreements signed with Delhi, during prime minister Shiekh Hasina's visit to India earlier this year, "anti-liberation" and "against sovereign interests". She urged all "freedom fighters" irrespective of opinion and party affiliation to unite against the agreements. Bangladesh and India signed three agreements during Hasina's India visit in Januaryone on Mutual Legal Assistance on Criminal Matters, one on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons and one on Combating International Terrorism, Organized Crime and Illicit Drug Trafficking. The two countries also signed MOUs on Cooperation in Power Sector and a Cultural Exchange Programme. In a joint statement issued by the two countries, Bangladesh agreed to allow the neighbour to have access Chittagong and Mongla ports The opposition leader warned the government against implementation of the accords with India and against any move to allow "the neighbouring country" to use Chittagong port. She asked her supporters: "I want to know from you whether Bangladesh will remain a sovereign nation or will it be a rent-dependent one. Are you ready to give transit to another country?" Khaleda also rejected recent statements by prime minister Sheikh Hasina, regarding lack of power generation during the past BNP-led government, as "false and fabricated". "She (Hasina) resorts to falsehood while abroad and presents fabricated information in parliament." The BNP chief said during her last 2001-2006 administration, the BNP-led government added 1515 megawatts of power to the national grid. "But the prime minister said we didn't add even one watt of power." b
