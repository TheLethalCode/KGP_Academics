 Dhaka, Mar 31 (bdnews24.com)Former Bhola-3 MP Mohammad Jashimuddin has been passed over by the ruling party this time round as the Awami League parliamentary board picked Md Nurunnabi Chowdhury to run in the April 24 election to the vacant seat. Meanwhile, the district returning officer approved three out of the four nominations received by the Bhola election commission after scrutiny of their papers on Wednesday. The nomination of independent candidate Md Faruq Farazi was cancelled for providing wrong information, assistant returning officer and district election commissioner Mohammad Hasanuzzaman told reporters. Hasanuzzaman said the independent candidates have to submit signatures of one percent voters of the constituency. "But we found anomalies in some of the signatures that Farazi submitted," he added. The three approved contestants were Jashimuddin and Chowdhury of the ruling Awami League and Maj (retd) Hafizuddin Ahmed of the BNP. Chowdhury will now run against Hafiz, after the party decided on their candidate. The EC declared the constituency vacant on Feb 3 as AL's Jashimuddin, a retired army officer, contested the 2008 general election before expiry of the stipulated waiting period. Electoral law stipulates that a government official cannot run in the election within five years after compulsory retirement. Jashimuddin was forced to retire from the army on Aug 31, 2004, and contested the general election in December 2008. He won the seat against BNP's Hafizuddin Ahmed, with a lead of 12,000 votes. Hafiz went on to challenge Jashim's candidacy at the High Court following which the seat was declared vacated. An AL presidium member after a meeting last week, on condition of anonymity, told bdnews24.com that barring legal complications, Md Jashimuddin was the "front runner" for an AL ticket. bdn
