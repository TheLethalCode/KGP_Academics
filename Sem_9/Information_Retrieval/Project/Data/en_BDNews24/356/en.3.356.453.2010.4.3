<TEXT>
 Fenchuganj, Apr 3 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina officially launched a 51MW rental power plant at Fenchuganj on Saturday. She opened the gas-driven plant, owned by Barakatullah Electro Dynamics Limited (BEDL), at around 11am. The plant has however been supplying electricity to the national grid since Oct 10, 2009. BEDL, mostly owned by Bangladeshi expatriates, is selling power at Tk 2.15 per kWh. It is contracted to supply electricity to the national grid for 15 years. The plant increases the total amount of installed capacity of power plants during the ruling Awami League's tenure since January 2009 to 531MW. The total potential capacity of all the power plants in the country now stands at 6005MW - generated from 354 units in 44 power stations. However, the maximum average daily power generated stands at only 3700MW. Jalalabad Gas Transmission and Distribution System Limited (JGTDSL) supplies about 10 million units of gas to the BEDL plant every day. The plant is unlikely to face gas shortages since it is located close to the gas fields in Sylhet, although a number of power in other parts of the country do face shortages. After the inauguration, Hasina went to Sylhet to offer her prayers at the shrines of Hazrat Shahjalal and Hazrat Shah Paran. She is scheduled to hold talks with the divisional and district level officials, local MPs and Awami League leaders in Sylhet later in the day. bd
