<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, Apr 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chechen rebels claimed responsibility on Wednesday for two suicide bombings that killed 39 people in the Moscow metro and threatened further attacks in the Russian heartland. In a video on Islamist rebel website www.kavkazcenter.com, Chechen rebel leader Doku Umarov said he ordered the Moscow attacks. The video was posted just hours after two suicide bombers killed at least 12 people in Russia's North Caucasus. The suicide bombings, which have killed at least 50 people and injured another 100 in less than three days, have stirred fears of a major bombing campaign against Russian cities by Islamist insurgents. Umarov, Russia's most wanted guerrilla who calls himself the "Emir of the Caucasus Emirate," said that he had ordered the twin suicide bombings in Moscow to "destroy infidels." "Both of these operations were carried out on my command and will not be the last," said Umarov, dressed in combat gear. "You Russians only see the war on television and hear it on the radio." The bearded 45-year-old sat on the ground in what looked like a clearing in a wood. "I promised you that the war will come to your streets, God willing, and you will feel it under your skin," Umarov said, ending the four-and-a-half minute long video with the words "Allahu Akhbar" and pointing his finger towards the camera. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who cemented his power in 1999 by launching a war to crush Chechen separatism, said the culprits behind the metro bombings must be scraped "from the bottom of the sewers." Putin, who many Russians believe is the country's paramount leader, said on Wednesday that a single group could have been behind the bombings in Moscow and Dagestan. SUICIDE BOMBINGS "Yet another terrorist act has been committed. I do not rule out that it is one and the same gang acting," Putin told a government meeting after twin suicide bombings in the Dagestani town of Kizlyar. A car packed with explosives blew up as police in the town gave chase and a bomber in a police uniform then set off a second blast in a crowd of police who had rushed to the site, local police said. The coordinated attack in Kizlyar, near Dagestan's border with Chechnya, was the latest outbreak in a surge of violence in the Caucasus that is challenging the Kremlin a decade after the second of two devastating wars against Chechen separatists. The Kremlin had declared victory in its battle with Chechen separatists, but analysts say a wave of shootings and bombings shows Moscow has failed to tame the growing insurgency. Local leaders say it is fuelled by desperate poverty, clan rivalries, rampant corruption, Islamism and heavy-handed tactics by law enforcement agencies. Umarov, who in February vowed to bring the war from the North Caucasus to the streets of Russian cities, said the attacks on Moscow were partly at attempt at revenge against Putin for his policies in the North Caucasus. Russian officials declined immediate comment on the video and state media largely ignored Umarov's claims. The website, which has been used by Chechen rebels to claim responsibility for attacks, said it had been sent the video but gave no more details. President Dmitry Medvedev said the attacks this week were "links in one chain" and that terrorists were trying "to sow fear and panic in the population. We will not allow this." Speaking in heavily accented Russian, Umarov singled out a battle with Russian forces last month in Ingushetia -- a region neighbouring Chechnya -- in which at least 20 insurgents and some civilians were killed. In the video clip, Umarov appeared to poke fun at Russia's main domestic security service, the FSB, saying that the bombings were partly to send "a greeting to the FSB." The most deadly of the bombs tore through the Lubyanka metro station, which stands in the shadow of the FSB's headquarters, just a few kilometres away from Red Square. Around 3,000 people gathered outside Lubyanka metro station on Wednesday to pay their respects, many lighting candles and laying red carnations at a makeshift memorial. At the meeting, which was organised by pro-Kremlin youth activists, a bell rang 39 times, once for each of those killed in the metro attac
