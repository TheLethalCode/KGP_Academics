<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 29 (bdnews24.com)  The military will be deployed at every WASA pump in Dhaka from April 1. Golam Mostafa, chairman of the Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority, said that similar to previous years, the army will be employed at every pump house of the capital. He told bdnews24.com in an exclusive interview on Monday that there was water shortage everywhere. "We take the army's help this time every year." Mostafa said that the problem would be alleviated if rains came within a month. "The army will be withdrawn once the situation improves." He said that the water pumps were important installations and thus needed to be protected by the army to avoid untoward situations. There are 546 pumps under Dhaka WASA's 10 zonal offices including that under Narayanganj zone. Among these, 293 pumps are run by generators. The WASA chairman said that if all the pumps could be run by generators, without depending on power supply and availability, the water shortage could easily be resolved. He said that out of Dhaka city's daily water demand of 220, WASA could only produce 190 crore litres. Mostafa said that WASA had the capacity of setting up 10 more water pumps but there are no spaces available in Gulshan, Uttara and Badda areas.
