President of the Krishak Sramik Janata Laegue, also known as Tiger Siddique, he was addressing a national council of Islami Shashontontro Chhatra Andolon at Paltan Maidan in Dhaka on Friday. The former Awami League leader said no one could stop Islamist politics in the country. He told the fundamentalist group of students, striving for a theocratic state, that different quarters were conspiring to put a stop to Islamist politics. "But it will survive till the end of the world." The valiant freedom fighter, who led the Kaderia Bahini  a guerrilla force  during the War of Independence, also termed Islamist parties as favourable towards Bangladesh's independence. Criticising the government activities he said AL would be destroyed if the current situation continued. Regarding members of the investigative agency and the prosecution panel for the trial of the war criminals, Kader said, "The nation does not know them." He demanded inclusion of lawyers like Rafique-Ul Huq and Kamal Hossain. Kader claimed that there were war criminals even inside the AL and demanded to public a list.
