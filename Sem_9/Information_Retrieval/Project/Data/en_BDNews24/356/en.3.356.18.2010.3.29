 Dhaka, Mar 29 (bdnews24.com)  The government has decided to drop lawyers, who are members of parliament, from the just-announced prosecution team to try alleged war criminals. The decision will exclude two ruling party MPs, Nurul Islam Sujan and Sanjida Khanam, from the newly constituted panel. The list of lawyers that was published on Mar 25 has also not been finalised, said law minister Shafique Ahmed on Monday following discussions with the investigative agency and the prosecution panel. "We have decided not to have any MPs in the lawyers' panel for these trials. The list of lawyers published earlier is not final", he said. When asked about the reasons behind the decision, he said "We do not want any question arising about the trials. The decision was taken so that none can complain of any partisanship." Only Golam Arif Tipu, a criminal lawyer, appointed as the chief prosecutor, will keep his position for certain. Other prosecutors that were named earlier for the panel will be finally selected only after further verification, said the minister. The government announced formation of the war crimes tribunal, investigative agency and prosecution team on Mar 25. The minister revealed the names of the judges, investigators and prosecutors at a press conference last Thursday, saying their work would start "immediately". The list of judges included justice Nizamul Haque, justice ATM Fazle Kabir and former district judge Zahirul Ahmed. The 12-member panel of lawyers were Golam Arif Tipu, the chief prosecutor, Syed Rejaur Rahman, Golam Hasnayen, Zahirul Hoque, Rana Das Gupta, Ziad Al Malum, Syed Haider Ali, Khandaker Abdul Mannan, Mosharraf Hossain Kajal, Nurul Islam Sujon, Sanjida Khanam and Sultan Mahmud Semon. The seven-member investigative agency had its first working day Monday. The agency chief Abdul Matin said, "We discussed various matters amongst ourselves on the first day." "We have decided to issue letters to Liberation War Museum, Sector Commanders Forum and other related bodies asking for various evidences about war criminals." Matin commented on the lack of logistic support as yet. "We will need a lot of logistic support. The computers have not yet been installed. We also do not have secure-enough places to store documents." The other six investigation officers are additional deputy inspector general of police Mir Shahidul Islam, former additional inspector general of police Abdur Rahim, former deputies inspector general of police Kutubur Rahman and Maj ASM Shamsul Arefin, and CID inspectors Nurul Islam and Abdur Razzak Khan. bdn
