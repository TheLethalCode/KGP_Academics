<TITLE> Pentagon puts pressure on Karzai over corruption </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KABUL, Mar 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Pentagon's top military officer followed his commander-in-chief to Kabul on Monday to keep up pressure on President Hamid Karzai to tackle corruption, which he said could ruin the war's new strategy. Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, arrived less than a day after President Barack Obama made the first trip of his presidency there, bringing a stern message that Karzai needs to do more to fight graft. Obama's strategy, backed by 30,000 more troops this year, enters its most ambitious phase with a major offensive starting in June in the Taliban's birthplace Kandahar, where the top provincial official is Karzai's half brother, Ahmad Wali Karzai. Mullen described Kandahar as Afghanistan's "centre of gravity" and the key to reversing the Taliban's momentum. But he said the whole strategy could fail if Karzai does not do more to fight corruption in his brother's southern fiefdom. "We will be unable to succeed in Kandahar if we cannot eliminate a vast majority of corruption there and set up a legitimate governance structure," he told reporters. "If we can't do that there, then we will not be able to succeed. We can succeed militarily, but it's not going to work. That's just a fact." Asked if Ahmad Wali Karzai should be sidelined, Mullen said: "I think that's something that President Karzai's going to have to figure out ... addressing the corruption and governance issues in Kandahar. It's not for us to figure out." But a senior US military official went further. "I'd like him out of there," the official said on condition of anonymity, talking of Ahmad Wali Karzai. "We'd rather not have a guy like that down there because he's so divisive. But there's nothing that we can do unless we can link him to the insurgency, then we can put him on the (target list) and capture and kill him," the official said. KANDAHAR CAMPAIGN As head of Kandahar's provincial council Ahmad Wali Karzai wields considerable power in the south, but has been accused of amassing a vast fortune from the drugs trade, intimidating rivals and having links to the CIA; charges he strongly denies. But there was no plan to target Ahmad Wali Karzai as yet. "We're not going in that direction," the senior official said. "The president of this country is the one that has to decide what to do with that guy." Ahmad Wali Karzai has taken on added importance for the United States ahead of an offensive to take control of Kandahar, Afghanistan's second largest city, and the province around it. Important elements of the Kandahar campaign, including outreach to tribal leaders, were already well under way, military officials said, and would intensify in the coming weeks with greater involvement by Karzai and other officials. Pointing to a calendar, one of the officials indicated the month of June as the likely start of the offensive. US forces hope to take some areas in and around Kandahar without a fight by reaching agreements with local tribal leaders, but the operation is expected to include a main thrust of roughly 10,000 troops for areas to be "cleared" by force. "The key thing is we've got to be done with that by Ramadan," the second official said, referring to the Muslim holy month of fasting that begins in August. The campaign would then shift from a "clearing" phase to a "secure and deliver government" phase, expected to last at least until mid-October, he said. The timetable for the Kandahar campaign, the most detailed made public to date, highlights the limited window available to US and NATO forces to turn the tide against the Taliban before a review of war strategy in late November or early December. That review will assess whether the US-led campaign and the training of the Afghan army and police have gained enough ground to allow a gradual US withdrawal to begin in July 2011. While US and European leaders accept that a deal with the Taliban is the only way to end the war, Mullen played down the chances of a political agreement in the short term. "I think it is premature. There's no one that I've spoken to, at least on the American side, or actually, on the coalition side, that doesn't think we need to proceed from a position of strength," Mullen said. "In my judgment, we're not there yet." Karzai this week held preliminary peace talks with Hezb-i-Islami, one of the smaller insurgent factions. Karzai is also holding a major peace conference in Kabul in early May. SECURITY AND GOVERNANCE In addition to cleaning up Afghan governance, Obama's strategy hinges on building up the country's army and police forces to take over security responsibility, a process that has been hamstrung by a shortage of international trainers. The United States has struggled to convince its NATO allies in Afghanistan to fill the shortfall, and Mullen said one option might be to send more US trainers to fill the gap. "We've asked and pushed our other partners to provide as many as possible. That continues ... We've come up short a few hundred," Mullen said. Aides to Mullen said the Pentagon did not currently envision a need to add trainers on top of the troop increase ordered by Obama in Decemb
