<TITLE> PM to launch 51MW plant </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 2 (bdnews24.com)  A 51MW rental power plant at Fenchuganj is set to be officially launched on Saturday. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina is scheduled to inaugurate the gas-driven plant, owned by Barakatullah Electro Dynamics Limited (BEDL), at noon. BEDL and the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) agreed on Apr 28, 2008 for supplying electricity to the national grid for 15 years. The plant began supplying electricity to the national grid from Oct 10, 2009. Commercial operations were launched on Oct 24, 2009. The BEDL, mostly owned by Bangladeshi expatriates, will sell power at Tk 2.15 per kWh. The commissioning will increase the total amount of installed capacity of power plants during the ruling Awami League's tenure to 531MW since January 2009. With this, installed capacity stands at 6005MW from 354 units in 44 power stations, while the maximum average generation stands at 3700MW. Jalalabad Gas Transmission and Distribution System Limited (JGTDSL) supplies about 10 million units of gas to the plant every day. The plant is unlikely to face gas shortage since it located close to the gas fields in Sylhet, although a number of power in other parts of the country do face shortages. MEASURES TO SAVE POWER The government recently undertook two measures to address the power crunch. A high-level meeting on Monday decided to stop gas supply to five major fertiliser factories and divert that to the power plants to increase electricity generation. "During the Boro season the government intends to provide the necessary electricity required for irrigation. So we need to generate more," Mohammad Hossain, director of power cell, told bdnews24.com on Thursday. The shutdown of urea factories, though a temporary measure, might continue till mid May, till the end of the boro season, he added. The additional power will be supplied for irrigation in the rural areas that require around 1600MW, as well as in the towns, suffering from severe power outage. At present, 8 plants, faced with gas shortage, are producing only 831MW against a production capacity of 1420MW. Even the newly installed 120MW Siddhirganj power plant, officially launched in February, has been failing to generate at full capacity. The Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Company Limited (CUFL) and Jamuna Fertiliser Company have already been shut down, while the Karnaphuli Fertiliser Company in Chittagong was under routine overhauling for the last few days. The two other factories in NarsingdiUrea Fertiliser Factory Ltd. (UFFL) and Polash Urea Fertiliser Factoryare yet to shut down. As a step to save power, the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) on Tuesday banned the use of air conditioners in factories, offices and private homes in the evenings from 6-11pm. In a circular the commission also said that AC temperature regulators cannot be set below 25 degrees Centigrade. But there were no estimates on how much power might be saved from stopping AC use. Country's 44 power plants on Wednesday generated 3705MW against a peak demand of 5300MW. Officials say that on top of power shortage there is also a system loss of about 15 percent caused by the faulty lines and poor condition of old plants. bdn
