<TEXT>
 Habiganj, Apr 2 (bdnews24.com)  The government has succeeded in all sectors except electricity generation, claimed finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith on Friday. He said that the government should try to improve this sector further during his speech at a programme in Habiganj. The finance minister's statement comes in the context of widespread discontent among the people and entrepreneurs. Currently, the average electricity production stands at around 4,000MW against an estimated demand of 6,000MW. Muhith was speaking at the inauguration of a new office building of Habiganj Chamber of Commerce and Industries. Given the shortfall of power supply the power agencies are having to cope with the situation through substantial load shedding that has affected the entire country. The Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) has even banned use of air conditioners to save electricity from 6-11pm daily till further notice. Only hospitals, hotels and restaurants have been exempted. On Thursday, even ruling Awami League's MPs expressed their deep concern and criticised the government over the raging power crisis at a pre-budget discussion with the finance minister. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina recently said that the government was sincerely trying to address the power crisis. "But it will take time."
