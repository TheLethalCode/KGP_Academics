 Dhaka, Mar 31 (bdnews24.com)  Finance minister AMA Muhith has urged auditors to focus more on performance than finding public sector corruption. He also urged "best use of public resources" through efficient auditing. Muhith, inaugurating the new Financial Management Academy (FIMA) building at Mirpur on Wednesday, emphasised the need for 'performance audits' and said that it was still not practiced in the country. He termed performance auditing the necessary last step in the auditing and accounting process, to measure "the level of implementation of work strategy, planning and budgeting made earlier." The Audit and Accounts Training Academy (AATA) was formed in 1974. The previous Awami League government converted the AATA to FIMA in 1997 to also train public servants of other government services and departments in financial management. Comptroller and auditor general Ahmed Ataul Hakim stressed the role of auditing in saving government funds and stopping spread of corruption. Finance secretary Mohammed Tarek urged FIMA to turn out efficient workforce in the public sector by providing modern training to international standards. Muhith said that FIMA must also be developed to aid the government's financial management and not only a training institute. bd
