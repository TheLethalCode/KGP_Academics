<TITLE> PSC for simplifying quotas </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 2 (bdnews24.com)The Bangladesh Public Service Commission (PSC) has recommended simplifying the system of job quotas for freedom fighters, women and indigenous communities. Currently, 45 percent of all posts are determined solely on the basis of merit. The remaining 55 percent is divided between different quotas - 30 percent for children of freedom fighters, 10 percent for women, 5 percent for indigenous people and the remaining 10 percent for a general category. Each of these quotas have sub-quotas to ensure that people from all the different districts get jobs in a fair way. However, the PSC annual report that was presented to parliament on Thursday by the local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam, states that the current system of allocating the quotas using divisional and district criteria is complicated and time consuming. It also says that the appointment of suitably qualified candidates is impossible in the current system. What this means, the report says, is that some posts are sometimes never filled and are just kept vacant. The PSC is therefore proposing that there should no longer be a need to consider from which part of the country a candidate comes. Instead, it proposes that within each quota category there will be competition solely on the basis of merit. Former cabinet secretary Akbar Ali Khan was positive about this proposal. Khan on Thursday told bdnews24.com: "Major complexities arise due to the current complicated quota system which leaves scope for inappropriate decisions." The report said that in 2009, the PSC conducted 88 different exams, including the BCS, where 361,130 contestants participated. Already the results of 69 exams have been finalised. bdnews24.
