<TITLE> US to impose new airline security measures </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Apr 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States will implement new airline security measures this month to replace mandatory screening of air travellers from 14 countries, a step that had angered some allies when it was imposed after a failed bombing on Christmas Day. The new measures, to be announced on Friday, are expected to significantly reduce the number of passengers pulled aside for additional screening and will not be based on nationality or passport, but on characteristics pulled together by intelligence agencies, a senior administration official said. The official, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity, said the new system would be "tailored" and described the measures being scrapped as a "blunt-force instrument." The new measures would require a traveller to undergo additional screening if they match information about terrorism suspects gathered by intelligence agencies, such as a physical description, partial name or travel pattern, the official said. The names of terrorism suspects identified by the US government will continue to be included on security watch lists and no-fly lists as a part of airline security. The new policy affects all travellers coming into the United States from abroad, not just those from the 14 countries previously focused on. The U.S. government implemented tighter airline security measures after the attempted bombing of a flight to Detroit from Amsterdam on Dec. 25 in which a Nigerian man tried to detonate explosives hidden in his underwear. Questions have been raised about why Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who was charged with trying to blow up the airliner, was not stopped before he got on the flight. The measures imposed following the attempted bombing required that passengers travelling to the United States from 14 countries be subjected to especially rigorous pre-flight screening. SOME OF THE 14 OBJECTED The 14 countries were those on the U.S. list of "state sponsors of terrorism" -- Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria -- as well as Afghanistan, Algeria, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Somalia and Yemen. Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Nigeria -- U.S. partners in the fight against al Qaeda -- were angered at being on the list. Under the new measures, if there was information about an individual of interest coming from a particular Asian country who recently travelled to certain countries in the Middle East and was of a certain nationality and age range, that data would be compared with travellers to the United States at foreign airports. "So it's much more tailored to what the intel is telling us, what the threat is telling us, as opposed to stopping all individuals of a particular nationality or all individuals using a particular passport," the official said. Anyone who fits the data could be subjected to additional screening procedures and pulled aside for questioning by airline or airport security officials. US officials have been consulting with countries and foreign carriers with direct flights to the United States about airline security, the US official said. "It is designed to be much more tailored so that we don't stop everybody coming from a certain country, because that information is out, and if I'm a terrorist, the last thing I want to do then is send somebody with this passport, going that way," he said. The US government also plans to release on Friday a review of rail security conducted over the past year in a report called "Surface Transportation Security Priority Assessment" that provides recommendations and guidelines on improving security on rail transportat
