 Dhaka, Mar 31 (bdnews24.com)  Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed has claimed that none of his party workers was involved in atrocities committed during the 1971 war of independence. "Nobody in Jamaat-e-Islami has committed crime in the 1971 war. The government is deliberately stage-managing a drama to destroy its political rivals in the name of trying the so-called war criminals," Mojaheed told a press briefing on Wednesday at the party's Moghbazar headquarters. "The government and its supporters have already made a list by terming the Jamaat leaders as war criminals. I want to tell the government that none of us will escape the country fearing the accusation." Mojaheed claimed that Jamaat-e-Islami is one of the country's popular parties. "It is an alternative way to torture the Jamaat leaders by bringing allegations of war crimes," he alleged. "Since none in the Jamaat was involved in war crimes there is no moral and legal ground to identify them as war criminals." He said that there was no Jamaat leader in the list of 752 people accused under 1972 Collaborator Act. The accused were pardoned following clemency declared by late president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1973, he said. "The then Awami League government listed 195 members of the Pakistan army as war criminals after an investigation. "All of them were Pakistani army officers. Nobody except them were identified as war criminals. "Sheikh Mujibur Rahman sent them back to Pakistan on April 9, 1974. The issue of war criminals was settled after they were sent back. "The government is holding the trial as a political vendetta. They are using the issue to divert people's attention from the crises like power, gas and water. "The Pilkhana tragedy and the latest government effort to try war criminals seem to be tied in one thread," Mojaheed said. He said the position of Jamaat-e-Islami was different during 1971 war because of party decision. But nobody in Jamaat left the country after the war. "The Jamaat leaders remained in the country and are still here after the liberation. This is our only address. The people of the country are our main shelter." Mojaheed said the auxiliary forces including Rajakar and Al Badar were created by an executive order from Golam Ishak Khan, the former cabinet secretary of Pakistan. "The Jamaat and its student wing have nothing to do with Rajakar, Al Badar and Al Shams. Nobody in Jamaat was either a member or a commander of the those organisaitons." Mojaheed denied that he was an Al Badar leader. "This is totally false and fabricated. I was not involved with any killing, looting or any other crimes during that time. "I am running 62. I did not commit any crime with my hands or gave any instruction to anybody either," the Jamaat leader claimed. Asked about his role in 1971 he said: "I was a member of a student organisation. I already forgot what I did that time." When asked whether he considered it rational to support Pakistan in 1971, the Jamaat leader said: "Past is past. Let's not discuss the past." "Why those people who committed atrocities in 1971 had been exempted? Why were they shown clemency?" he asked. Mojaheed, however, evaded the reply when asked if Jamaat-e-Islami would seek forgiveness for their position against the liberation war. Asked to comment on why they were opposing the trial of war criminals, the secretary general said: "Since the matter has been resolved 36 years ago, it should not come up anymore." Replying to a query he said: "Khaleque Majumder was exempted from the High Court." Khaleque, who is one of the alleged mastermind of the massace of Bangladeshi intellectuals during the war, is currently a member of the Jamaat-e-Islami. Jamaat nayeb-e-amir maolana Delwar Hossain Saidee and assistant secretary general M Kamaruzzaman were present at the press conference. bdne
