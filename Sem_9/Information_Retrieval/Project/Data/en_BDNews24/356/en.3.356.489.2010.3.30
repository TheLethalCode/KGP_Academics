 Dhaka, Mar 30 (bdnews24.com)The government has barred use of air conditioners from 6 pm to 11 pm daily until further notice for all residences, private and public offices, businesses and shops. The bar, however, will not apply to hospitals, restaurants and hotels. The Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission, in an order issued Tuesday, also said that AC temperatures cannot be set below 25 degrees Centigrade during off-peak hours. The BERC order comes just a day after the government decided to shut down all the fertiliser factories to divert gas to power plants. The decision underscores the critical situation now prevailing in the power sector. It also instructed related authorities and persons to take required steps immediately and stated that the order will be in force with immediate effect until further notice. The energy regulator said its order, issued under the Energy Act 2003, is intended to tackle the crippling power outages, ensure uninterrupted power supply to farmers for irrigation and ease sufferings of Higher Secondary Certification examinees. But questions were immediately raised on whether the regulatory body has the power to enforce the order. BERC chairman Syed Yusuf Hossain, questioned by reporters in a press briefing after announcing the measure, said, "If DESCO, DPDC and Petrobangla report to us then we will take measures." When asked what measures would be taken to punish violators, he said that the commission does not want to take any extreme measures like imposing fines or worse, but was rather appealing to the consumers. "We can only ask the consumers to obey the order and if they do not comply we'll disconnect their services", he said. According to the Energy Act 2003, if anyone violates the commission's orders it can penalise the consumer with a fine of up to Tk. 2000 or imprisonment for three months. Salim Mahmud, BERC member told bdnews24.com that the order is only applicable for consumers from the national grid and not for those who run ACs on other power sources like generators. bdnew
