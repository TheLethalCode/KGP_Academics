Washington has said it supports plans to reintegrate low-level fighters back into Afghan society, while cautiously backing Afghan efforts to reconcile with senior insurgents, provided they lay down their weapons and repudiate al Qaeda. Last week, US Defence Secretary Robert Gates said the timing was still not right for reconciliation with senior Afghan Taliban leaders, acknowledging military pressure had yet to weaken the group enough. Hezb-i-Islami, led by veteran guerrilla commander Gulbuddin Hekmatyar has shared some of the aims of the Taliban, but has led a separate insurgency, mainly in the east and north of Afghanistan.
