Siddhirganj police chief Mokhlesur Rahman said that the men confessed to having stolen over 100 transformers mainly in the Dhaka City Corporation area, whilst working in groups of eight to 10. "Members of a team first disconnect the power supply. They then take the machines apart and load them in a waiting truck. "The stolen machines are then taken to the assembling factories, and after reassembling the parts, they are sold, with the help of dishonest officials, to the Palli Bidyut Samity," Mokhlesur said quoting the thieves.
