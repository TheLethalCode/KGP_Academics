<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 31 (bdnews24.com)The legal framework to further open up VoIP would be finalized within the next two months, said the chairman of the parliamentary standing committee for post and telecommunications ministry. "The ministry has assured the committee that the legal framework would be completed within two months," Hasanul Haq Inu told reporters Wednesday. The committee has strongly recommended expediting the process, he added. "We welcome the BTRC's drive to curb illegal VoIP, but still the committee pressed the ministry to further open it up so that the government can earn more revenue." VoIP, or Voice over Internet Protocol, is a technology that allows telephone calls to be made free over the Internet. It has been legalised in Bangladesh, but licensed operators have to give away more than 54 percent of revenue to the government, making illegal operations lucrative. The cabinet Monday gave a nod to the draft of a new policy to bring down costs of international calls by further opening up the long distance telecommunications facilities. According to the 'International Long Distance Telecommunications Service Policy 2010' draft, the telecom ministry will award the licenses and fix tariffs for international call terminations instead of the regulator BTRC. All other telecom licensing and tariff fixing, however, would remain under the jurisdiction of the Bangladesh Telecommunications Regulatory Commission. "The parliamentary committee would scrutinize the new policy for international long distance calls" said Inu. Opening up of VoIP business would create more employment as well as an avenue to earn foreign currency, according to the standing committee chairman. The committee is also weighing an option to rent out or sell the excess bandwidth from the submarine cable to different countries and multinational companies like Google, Yahoo and Microsoft. "The final decision on this issue would be made on April 20 at a meeting of the Submarine Cable Company in Cox's Bazaar," he said. The committee also recommended lowering of bandwidth charge and setting up an alternative landing station of the submarine cable. Inu told the press briefing that state-owned Bangladesh Telephone Shilpa Sangstha (TSS) in collaboration with a Malaysian company would start production of laptops, telephone sets, battery, chargers and solar panels from June this year. He also said that 600 post offices of the country would start money transferring facility through SMSs from April 18. "Gradually 1,500 pots offices would be brought under this network."
