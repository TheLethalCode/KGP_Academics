Referring to the accused at the dock he said, "These people looted the armoury, insulted the higher ranked officers and gave wrong information to journalists and slandered the military." He also requested the court to charge all of the accused. The court adjourned till June 20 when charges will have been framed and ordered the prosecutor to produce the accused at the court that day. The director general warned the accused that their activities were being observed by closed circuit cameras. "Anyone found at fault will be punished."
