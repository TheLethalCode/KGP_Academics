 NEW DELHI, Apr 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India on Thursday kicked off what it says will be the world's biggest census that it hopes will help plug wastage in government welfare schemes, boost tax revenue and define consumers more clearly. More than two million census workers will cover an estimated 1.2 billion people, defining them in demographic, socio-cultural and economic terms, including such parameters as mobile phone and Internet usage and banking access.

The data will also help take the guesswork out of companies' investment and marketing plans in Asia's third largest economy. "For a large country like ours, any detail that you can get on the population is always useful," said Ajit Ranade, chief economist at Aditya Birla Group. "We just don't know enough." The government will also, for the first time, spend about 35 billion rupees ($786 million) on preparing a National Population Register (NPR), which will have photographs and fingerprints of all persons above the age of 15 years. The NPR will pave the way for the ambitious Unique Identification scheme, which aims at issuing a smart card and UID number to every Indian citizen, enabling easier access to banking, welfare payments and boost tax collecti
