<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 2 (bdnews24.com)  The main opposition BNP on Friday voiced their scepticism over the government's real intention about trying suspected war criminals. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain expressed his party's suspicion at a press conference at its Paltan office on Friday. The briefing was held to announce the party's decisions taken at Thursday's national standing committee meeting headed by chairperson Khaleda Zia. "The government is moving away from the war crimes trial and talking about holding trials for crimes against humanity," he said. "It is possible to judge crimes such as murder, looting, arson, rape and abduction under the current penal code. There is no need to form a special court, tribunal or investigation agency for that," he added. However, like the war crimes trials, BNP has no objection regarding trials for crimes against humanity if they are held properly, said the veteran BNP leader. At the same time, he accused that the government of trying to use the 'crimes against humanity' trials for subduing opposition members instead of fulfilling its real purpose. He commented on the investigative agency for the special tribunal, saying, "The appointments for investigation officers and lawyers include members of a certain party. They will try to implicate members of the opposition as offenders. So fairness cannot be expected of them." The veteran lawyer insisted that the trial for crimes against humanity can be held, according to the penal code, saying, "Bringing new amendments to the law will itself be unacceptable legally." He also pointed out that the Supreme Court gave this opinion for the BDR trials. Delwar firmly said, "No one opposes proper trials of war criminals. It was always said that the trials should be held transparently and without politicisation." He expressed his anxiety by saying, "People want to know whether the government actually wants the war crimes or the crimes against humanity trials, or whether they are using it as a ploy to divert peoples' attention from the current crisis. The government intends to eradicate the opposition under cover of the crimes against humanity trials." Delwar criticised the conflicting speeches over the past one and half years by prime minister Sheikh Hasina and her cabinet members regarding the trials and the publication of the war criminals list by ministers. But the law minister and a number of his colleagues are saying that the government has no lists and that the investigative agency will draw up a list, he said, adding "people are getting confused over this and are becoming suspicious of the government's real intention", the BNP leader said. Standing committee member Sarwari Rahman, office secretary Rezvi Ahmed and others attended the press meet.
