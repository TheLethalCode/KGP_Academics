<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 31 (bdnews24.com)  President Zillur Rahman underscored concerns on Wednesday over the slow development of civic and municipal facilities in face of booming urban populations. "Like many developing countries, Bangladesh is seeing rapid urbanisation. People are gradually heading to the cities for various socio-economic reasons", the president told mayors at the National Convention 2010 of the Municipal Association of Bangladesh (MAB) at Dhaka's Radisson Hotel. He also highlighted the current government's intention to increase efficiency and strengthen the local governance system and said that ensuring equal rights of citizens will help turn the huge population into an efficient resource. Mentioning that the government does not lack sincerity for this, the predient added: "However, there is lack of resources and effort. For that we need help from private sector and individual initiatives." He also commented that the private-public partnership programme might play a crucial role. The president told the mayors "People relied on you and gave the mayor's responsibility. You will have to keep up to that reliance and return accordingly." He urged the mayors to make their municipals an ideal for others by their individual planning, initiative and utmost sincerity. MAB's president Ajmat Ullah Khan said, "The convention aims to highlight at the national level issues of municipalities' interests." He also urged rearrangement of the presidential warrant for municipal mayors and councillors and to make the honorary allowances more appropriate to the current times. Among the 16 point demands of the association are composing management manuals for health and education facilities, ensuring the proper utilisation of municipal lands, setting up municipal courts, national policy on building up municipalities and making 'Bangladesh Municipal Development Fund' effectual. The prime minister's adviser H T Imam said: "It's not possible to implement all the demands, but some demands will gradually be implemented". bd
