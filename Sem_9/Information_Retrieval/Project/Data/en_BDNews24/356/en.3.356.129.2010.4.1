 Dhaka, Apr 1 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka's passport office started receiving applications for Machine Readable Passports (MRPs) from Thursday, which will be issued early next month. "We have already started receiving applications today," Parvin Banu, director of the passport and immigration directorate, told bdnews24.com. She said 20 applications were received till 4 pm. Nine other regional passport offices will start receiving applications between Apr 18 and Apr 20, she added. The facility will gradually be made available to all the 24 regional passport offices. The applicants will be given the new passports from May. The MRP project director, Brig Gen Refayet Ullah, on Thursday told bdnews24.com: "The age and the national identity cards of the applicants will be scrutinised, while the applications will also be forwarded to the Special Branch of police for verification. The passports will be issued given after completing all necessary requirements, including photographs and fingerprints. Fees applicable for the general passports would be Tk 3,000 and for urgent ones Tk 6,000. It will cost between Tk.700 to Tk. 800 to produce each MRP, Ullah added. There are currently about 1.2 crore manual passport holders in the country. According to the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), all countries must introduce machine-readable passports (MRP) and machine-readable visas (MRV) by April 1. To comply with ICAO requirement, the passport department hired IRIS, a Malaysian company to produce MRP/MRV. There were allegations of irregularities and political interference in the awarding of the contract to the Malaysian company. The allegations were made after the company was banned in Turkey for not being able to complete the same job in time. The ban will remain effective till October 2011. Rejecting the allegations, Refayet Ullah on Wednesday told a press conference, "IRIS was given the contract considering its skill and by maintaining transparency. "I'll accept any punishment if we can't complete the job in time," he added. bdnews
