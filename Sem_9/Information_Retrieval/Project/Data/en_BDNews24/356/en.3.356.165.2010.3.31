<TITLE> Farming regions getting more power, says PDB </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 31 (bdnews24.com)The country's power plants generated over 4000MW of electricity on Tuesday by diverting more gas to the plants, with farming regions getting more power as a result, officials said on Wednesday. The level of electricity generated was 500MW more than the previous day, with the country's northern region being the principal beneficiary of the additional power. "We gave the additional power to the Rajshahi and Rangpur regions as there has been no rain in those parts in recent days," Jamal Ullah, member (distribution) of the Power Development Board (PDB) told bdnews24.com. The absence of rains means that more electricity is needed for the irrigation plants. The additional gas was provided to the plants by reducing the level of gas supplied to consumers and industry. Jamal said there were rains in other parts of the country in the last few days and so the demand for irrigation in those areas reduced. If there was no problem in gas supply, the plants could produce nearly an additional 1000MW. On Monday, the PDB calculated that an additional 965MW could have been generated with more gas. According to the PDB, the country's irrigation plants use almost two thirds of the total electricity required by the Rural Electrification Board (REB) to fulfill its demand  1600MW daily out of a total 2200/2500MW. The government's decision on Monday to stop gas supplies being sent to the major fertilizer factories could save around 880mmcf gas that can generate more than 400-450MW, Petrobangla Chairman Hossain Monsoor told bdnews24.com on Monday. A similar step was taken last year when three fertiliser factories were shut down. It remains unclear how long the factories will need to be closed, but it could be until the middle of May, just after the end of the Boro season. Jamal said the level of power generation should start to further increase on Wednesday or Thursday, as the factories start to close down. Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution has already sent letters of request to the factories asking them to shut down. "We've requested them to stop production as soon as possible," Md Aziz Khan, Titas managing director, told bdnews24.com on Wednesday adding that, "the factories can't however be stopped there and then." In any day, about 15% of the total electricity generated is lost to system loss  due to technical faults in plants and distribution lines  which amounts to about 500 -600 MW.
