 Dhaka, Apr 2 (bdnews24.com) -- Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray, on Friday, flayed tennis star Sania Mirza for her decision to marry Pakistani cricketer Shoaib Malik, saying had Sania's heart been Indian, it wouldn't have beaten for a Pakistani, reports PTI. "Henceforth, Sania will not remain an Indian. Had her heart been Indian, it wouldn't have beaten for a Pakistani. If she wished to play for India, she should have chosen an Indian life partner," 84-year-old Thackeray said in an editorial in party mouthpiece Saamana. "More than victories on tennis court, Sania became famous for her tight clothes, fashion and love affairs," Thackeray alleged. "More than her play, people's attention was on her mannerisms," he claimed. The Shiv Sena supremo alleged that "for Shoaib, India is an enemy, not only in sports arena but also in the battlefield. "We have heard that Shoaib has many affairs in India and has promised many girls he will marry them," he said. Thackeray also expressed surprise over the alacrity with which Sania's family members were granted Pakistani visas. "Getting a Pakistani visa is tough even for a singer like Lata Mangeshkar," he said. Sania, 23, who is the most successful woman tennis player from the sub-continent, will settle down with 28-year-old Shoaib in Dubai after their marriage on Apr 15 in Hyder
