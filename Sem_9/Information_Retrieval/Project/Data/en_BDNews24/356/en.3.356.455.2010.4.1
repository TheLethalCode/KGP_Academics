 Dhaka, Apr 01 (bdnews24.com)  The state minister for environment and forests Hasan Mahmud is going to Kolkata on Apr 4 with a view to initiating popular interest in India in support of nominating the Sundarbans as one of the world's seven wonders. The Sundarbans  unlike Cox's Bazar, the longest sea beach of Bangladesh - has made it on the list of the top 28 wonders, and it will be from this list that the top seven will be chosen. People can vote until the end of the year Dr Hasan Mahmud said on Thursday that "Votes have been taken at different times to determine the world's seven wonders  but the Sundarbans has never got enough votes. In order to get on this list, the Sundarbans requires another 15 crore votes  and to get this we will need more than just votes from Bangladesh." "In any case, 40 percent of the Sundarbans is located in West Bengal. So we have taken the initiative to spread publicity across India. We have to get Indian's support to keep the Sundarbans a chance to be in the top seven." The state minister said a number of Bangladeshi TV channels and some Indian non government organizations and media are helping to get publicity. He said that the Indian state minister for environment and forests will assist. There will be a meeting of the ministers on April 4. The two ministers will visit the Indian portion of the Sundarbans the following day. The state minister will return home on April 6.
