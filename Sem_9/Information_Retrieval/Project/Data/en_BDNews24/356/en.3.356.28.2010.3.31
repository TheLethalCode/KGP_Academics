 Dhaka, March 31 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka passport office will start receiving application for Machine Readable Passports from Thursday (April 1), and they will be issued at the start of May. Home secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikder on Wednesday told reporters that in the first phase, application for MRP will only be received in Dhaka and from April 18 the facility will be extended to 10 other regional passport offices. Gradually the facility will be made available in 24 regional passport offices, he added. Sobhan said that it will be possible to issue the first batch of new passports by the first week of May. The MRP project director, Brig. Gen. Refayet Ullah, said that fees applicable for the general passports would be Tk 3,000 and for urgent ones Tk 6,000. It will cost between Tk.700 to Tk. 800 to produce each MRP, Ullah added. The passports will be of international standard and after the application they will be able to supply the passport by the first week of May after completing necessary works, he said. In response to a question the home secretary said the project will cost around Tk. 483 crore and it might exceed the estimates. It will take a bit longer to get the MRP in hand in the earlier stage, but handwritten passport will be issued for a year for convenience of the applicants. There are currently some 1.2 crore manual passport holders in the country. According to the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), all countries must introduce machine-readable passports (MRP) and machine-readable visas (MRV) by April 1. To comply with ICAO requirement, the passport department hired IRIS, a Malaysian company to produce MRP/MRV. Concerns were raised earlier during the tender process as the Malaysian company has been blacklisted in Turkey for its inefficiency in a similar job. The Turkish government has prohibited IRIS from taking part in any government tenders until October 2011 as it failed to complete an e-passport project in time. b
