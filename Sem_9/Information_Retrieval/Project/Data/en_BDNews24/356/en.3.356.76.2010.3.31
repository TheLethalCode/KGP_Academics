<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 31 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court returned a petition by Drik Gallery on Wednesday challenging the closure of its photo exhibition titled 'Crossfire', after police withdrew from the gallery the day before. But the court asked the petitioner to come back with the petition if police obstruction recurred. The vacation bench of justice Md Shahidul Islam heard the petition, challenging the police action preventing entry of viewers to the exhibition. Shahidul Alam, the photographer and Drik's managing director, filed the petition on Tuesday seeking a High Court order declaring the closure illegal and a direction to the government to allow the exhibition to take place. The police stated that DRIK needed 'prior permission' to hold the exhibition and that going ahead with it would 'cause unrest'. The court during the hearing commented on why 'cross-fires' were continuing to occur even after repeated rules had been issued on the government seeking an explanation regarding such incidents. The court further queried whether the holding of such an exhibition would cause any difficulties for the state, and why restrictions should be placed on any citizen from freely participating in such an event. Additional attorney general MK Rahman, who argued for the state, said the petition did not hold merit since police had already been withdrawn from outside the gallery the day before. Rahman also argued that the gallery needed prior permission to open an exhibition. "But the gallery authorities had not done so," he said. Barrister Sara Hossain, who argued for the petitioner, said the police had left at 4:30pm on Tuesday but visitors were still barred from entry. She pointed out that there was no example in the past that required prior permission for painting or photography exhibition. Shahidul Alam has held many exhibitions over the last 20 years, she said and pointed out that he had not faced such a bar at these shows. She told bdnews24.com after the ruling that the court had returned the petition. But the ruling also asked the petitioner to come back with the petition if police obstruction recurred, Hossain said. The police barred visitors from entering the gallery in Dhaka on Mar 22 after it refused to suspend the exhibition of images alluding to 'Crossfire' by the elite Rapid Action Battlaion. So far 654 people in RAB custody have been killed in 'crossfire', a euphemism for extra judicial killings, since the formation of this force on March 26, 2004. Drik's announced after the police withdrawal on Tuesday that since people could not visit the exhibition, the gallery was extending till April 14, which was previously set to close at 8pm on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Shahidul Alam filed a general diary on Mar 29 with Dhanmondi Police Station after he received a death threat two days ago. b
