 Dhaka, Mar 31 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina said Wednesday that her government is working to resolve power crisis, but it will take time. She blamed the two-year caretaker government and five-year BNP-led four-party alliance government for the current power crunch. "It's not possible to solve overnight the seven years' burden." The prime minister was speaking at the inauguration of BCS digital expo-2010. Hasina said that it needs a pretty good time to install a power station. She urged austerity from all electricity consumers and suggested that the offices should use solar panel. Bangladesh Bank on Tuesday installed a solar system on the rooftop of its main building to reduce growing pressure on electricity. The prime minister said that gas shortage is the prime factor behind the current problem in electricity production. "Power generation needs gas. No gas field has been explored since we left in the first term." Hasina briefed on the initiatives taken by her administration to improve the situation. "The aim of digital Bangladesh is to deliver government services to people's doorsteps by bring transparency in administration and ensuring accountability." She said that an IT village would be built in the capital's Mahakhali. Hasina asked related authorities to take measures in preventing hacking of public websites. Bangladesh government website, operated from the prime minister's office, had been attacked by Indian hackers in recent times. Bangladesh Computer Samiti president Mostafa Zabbar presided over the programme. bd
