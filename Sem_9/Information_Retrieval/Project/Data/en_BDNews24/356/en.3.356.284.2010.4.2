<TEXT>
 Sylhet, Apr 2 (bdnews24.com)  The trials of 14 BDR personnel from 8 rifles battalion charged with mutiny started on Friday in special court3 at the BDR office in Akhalia Sadar.. The day started with the battalion's deputy additional director Md Abdul Wahid reading out the charges against the 14 men. Of the 14 accused, 10 have so far been arrested. The court, headed by BDR chief Maj Gen Mainul Islam, sat from 8.30am  11am and ordered the arrest of the four absconding men. It was adjourned until 8:30am on Saturday where the accused were again asked to be present in court. Nearly 60 army officers, deputed to the border force, were brutally killed on Feb 25 and 26 at Pilkhana, while rebellion spread to other BDR outposts around the country. The government formed six special courts under BDR law last year, including two in Dhaka, to try some 3,500 border guards accused in some 40 cases in connection with the Pilkhana mutiny and associated rebellions in different districts. The special courts are only trying the charges of mutiny and rebellion, under BDR law. Trials of the other serious crimes, including murder, rape and arson, which are being investigated by CID, will be held in a civilian court. The first of the BDR trials began at Rangamati on Nov 24 against border guards accused of taking up arms in rebellion and solidarity with the Pilkhana mutineers. Special courts are holding similar trials in Feni, Satkhira and Thakurgaon. In the event of a guilty verdict by the special courts, the maximum penalty for mutiny or rebellion is seven years in jail. The killings at Pilkhana will carry the maximum penalty under ordinary criminal law. bdnews
