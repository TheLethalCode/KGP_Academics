Although initially expected, she did not halt at Feni on her way to the port city. BNP standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, speaking from Chittagong, told bdnews24.com that the BNP is starting its divisional rallies from Chittagong since former president Ziaur Rahman, the party's founder, declared the independence of Bangladesh in 1971 from that place.
