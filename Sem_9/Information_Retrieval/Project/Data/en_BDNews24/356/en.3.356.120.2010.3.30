 Dhaka, Mar 29 (bdnews24.com)  Metropolitan Police's detective branch are claiming that it has apprehended the people responsible for the murder of old Dhaka's ward commissioner Ahmed Hossain. Police arrested Shubhadda union chairman Md Nazimuddin from Bijoynagar area on Sunday afternoon. The police claim that he is the main person who paid for the murder to take place. The police also arrested the person alleged to be the attack's supervisor Shahidul Islam Bidyut  who is also said to be the toll collector for the well known dacoit, Shahid whom Nazimuddin is alleged to have paid to organise the murder. Another person, Kawsar Ahmed was arrested following a shootout with police at a field at Dholaipar area on the same day. Two firearms, ammunition and a knife were recovered from the men. Another three men including the commissioner's bodyguard Guddu, and the Dacoit Shahid's henchmen Aslam and Nantu had earlier been arrested. Police claim that Aslam and Nantu were also responsible for the murder of gold jewellery businessman Premkrishna on Mar 4. The police say that one of the arrested men, Bidyut, has confirmed to them what took place. Hossain, who was president of Dhaka City Jubo Dal's south chapter, was shot at around 8.30pm in front of Alu Bazar Bara Masjid while leaving the mosque after Esha prayers. DMP chief AKM Shahidul Haque told journalists at DB headquarters on Monday morning that, "The murder occurred due to a conflict over money. Nazimuddin had invested Tk four crores in Dhaka Tower. But the commissioner had not handed over the rights to the property. As a result, Nazimuddin paid dacoit Shahid Tk 40 lakh to murder the commissioner. Shahid's henchmen executed the murder on Shahid's order. Police say that they did not find any political motivation to the murder. According to the police, Shahid initially assigned Aslam and Nantu to carry out the execution, but when after two months they had failed to carry out the order, he assigned Bidyut and Kawsar . In the meantime, Nazimuddin had been able to persuade the commissioner's bodyguard, Guddu to help him in the murder. Assistant commissioner of DB, Md Sanwar Hossain claimed to journalists that, "On the day of the murder, Guddu signalled to the waiting assailants that the commissioner was leaving the mosque after saying his prayers. Kawsar and the three other men shot the commissioner and ran away. Bidyut supervised the whole execution over the phone from the Saarc Hotel." Bidyut himself told journalists at the DB office that, "Kawsar shot dead the commissioner on instructions of Shahid Bhai. I kept track of what was going on over phone from the hotel. Kawsar was paid Tk 50 thousand for doing this." The assistant commissioner said that Kawsar and Nazimuddin were arrested based on information from Bidyut. Nazimuddin however claimed that he is innocent and that he does not know Bidyut and the others. However Bidyut responded by saying that in fact Nazimuddin knows both dacoit Shahid and Bidyut quite well. Bidyut also said that the men had killed Sutrapur gold businessman Premkrishna on the instructions of dacoit Shahid. He claimed that Shahid had asked for toll from Premkrishna's elder brother, who simply swore at him. Shahid then ordered the murder. The two brothers later agreed to pay the toll but Shahid refused to accept it. On the day of the murder, Bidyut pointed out Premkrishna to Kawsar who shot him. Bidyut also revealed that Shahid extorts Tk 6-8 lakh from different areas of Sutrapur every month. Shahid's toll collector also said that the money is sent to Shahid though the hands of many people who are all paid a monthly fee. b
