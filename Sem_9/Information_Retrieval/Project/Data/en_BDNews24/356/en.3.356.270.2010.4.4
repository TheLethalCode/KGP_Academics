<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 4 (bdnews24.com)The government has decided to explain the current situation in the power and energy sector within this month, in an apparent effort to ease growing public anger. Finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith told reporters at a pre-budget discussion at his ministry on Sunday that the government will circulate a statement clarifying Bangladesh's energy situation. "The statement will provide details of power plants, production capacity, tender schedules and expected dates of additional power generation." However, such a detailed statement would not be possible for the fossil fuels, he said. "For fossil fuels it will be more speculative in nature." In relation to natural gas, he said, the statement will only include the schedules of upcoming projects for gas fields that have already been developed. Commenting on the overall economic situation, the minister said that economic growth is estimated to be at 6.7 percent. He predicted that 'inflation would be the same as now' at about 6.5 percent. The finance minister said that the size of the budget would be about Tk 1,300 billion, and the annual development programme will be Tk 380 billion. Touching on the national priorities, Muhith said that the next budget's focus would naturally be on power and energy. "Similar to previous budgets, the next one will also focus on food price," he said. The government will also initiate measures to increase income tax collection as well as value-added tax. "The issue of taxing income from the stock market (profit from share trade) will be reviewed," Muhith said. Responding to the reporters' suggestion of increasing focus upon the railway and waterways, the finance minister agreed, saying that Bangladesh has the "highest density of roads." On the crucial issue of energy crisis, Muhith said import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) will be approved as early as next month. "About 500 million units (500mcf) of LNG may be imported annually." Muhith announced that the government has decided to set up solar panels for powering the secretariat complex. "The prime minister's office and the central bank have already done it and we hope to do it next year." The finance minister sounded quite confident about reasonably satisfactory implementation of the upcoming budget. He, however, rejected the suggestion that the government had made any pledges regarding a monitoring committee for budget implementation. He said the monitoring situation had improved. "The planning minister sits with the officials concerned every month while the economic relations division secretary keeps an eye on the projects running on foreign aid.
