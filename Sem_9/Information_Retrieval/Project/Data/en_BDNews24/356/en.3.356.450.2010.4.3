 Dhaka, Apr 3 (bdnews24.com)  The government has no idea of how many people are disabled in the country, admitted the head of National Disability Development Foundation. Gazi Mohammad Nurul Kabir told bdnews24.com after inaugurating a handicraft fair of items made by autistic children in the city on Saturday that according to World Health Organisation estimates a tenth of any country's population of any country is disabled. That estimate suggests that 15 million Bangladeshis may be disabled, said Kabir. "But the government has no statistics." Autism Welfare Foundation, an organisation working for the welfare of autistic children, organised the six-day fair at Mohammadpur. He did not directly answer a question as to why a list of disabled people could not be prepared and said such a project to enlist disabled persons are going on and the task will be completed by next year. To a question, he said: "Autism didn't draw due attention for long. Now the government has taken some initiatives for development and welfare of autistic children and adolescents." Kabir said as part of the initiatives, an autism resources centre has been established, on the Disability Development Foundation compound. He said autism awareness workshops would be arranged at seven divisional towns in mid-April where guardians of autistic children, teachers of school and colleges and others would be invited. Besides, he said, there is a plan to establish an autistic school at each district town. Autism Welfare Foundation chairperson Dr Rownak Hafiz said the handicrafts fair has been organised on the occasion of World Autism Awareness Day and sixth founding anniversary of the foundation. Items prepared by 50 students of the foundation's teaching centre have been put on display at the fair.
