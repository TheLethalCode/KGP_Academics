 Syed Nahas Pasha London, April 2 (bdnews24.com)  Five illegal Bangladeshi workers have been detained at two restaurants in the towns of Bath and Minehead in the western part of England. The two restaurants could now face large fines for employing them. Acting on intelligence, the UK Boarder Agency (UKBA) officers targeted Taj Mahal restuarant in Minehead, last Thursday morning (25 March) and checked the immigration status of staff. Three Bangladeshi men, who were all employed as chefs, were found to have stayed in the UK illegally after their visas had expired. They were arrested and taken to a police station and on Thursday were still in detention while arrangements are made to remove them from the UK. The Taj Mahal restaurant was served with a civil penalty notice for employing three illegal workers. If the employer is unable to provide evidence that they carried out checks before giving the workers' jobs - such as asking for a passport or a Home Office document - it faces a fine of up to 10,000. UKBA officers also visited Rajpoot restaurant in Bath where two other Bangladeshi men were arrested after they were found to have entered the UK illegally. The pair, who were both working as chefs, were taken to Bath police station to be interviewed. They have since been released on immigration bail and must report regularly to a police station while the necessary travel documents for their removal are organised. Rajpoot Restaurant was also handed a civil penalty notice. Jane Farleigh, Regional Director of the UK Border Agency in Wales and the South West, said, "If people want to live or work in the UK, there are ways they can come here legitimately - such as applying through our points-based system for migration. If people choose to flout the law, we will find them and look to remove them from the country." She said, "Any employer who takes on a foreign national without permission to work in the UK is breaking the law, undermining law-abiding businesses and faces a big fine." UK Government is currently making a series of reforms to the immigration system. Identity cards for foreign nationals are being introduced to protect identity fraud and illegal working. The Australian-style points based system for managing migration is ensuring that only those with the skills the UK needs are allowed to work
