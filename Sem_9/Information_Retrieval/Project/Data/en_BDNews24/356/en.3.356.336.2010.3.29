<TITLE> Thai PM prepares for more talks with "red shirts" </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, Mar 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva was set to resume talks with "red shirt" opposition protesters on Monday to find a way out of a political crisis that has intensified in recent days and could rattle investors. Tens of thousands of demonstrators demanding fresh elections turned up the heat over the weekend but investors have largely shrugged off the protests, buying a net 47 billion baht ($1.45 billion) of shares since Feb. 22. However, the stock market ended down almost 1 percent on Monday and has lost about 2.6 percent since reaching a 21-month high on Wednesday. Analysts said investors could be concerned about the tense protests, or had simply overbought. Protesters massed on Sunday outside an army base where Abhisit has stayed, a day after declaring they were "at breaking point", surrounding his Government House office and forcing thousands of troops to pack up and leave to avert clashes. "The unsettling political situation will limit fund inflows to the Thai stock market," said Chakkrit Charoenmetachai, an analyst with Globlex Securities. "Foreign investors have made huge buys ... so they could hold back somewhat now." The Finance Ministry said in revised economic forecasts published on Monday that the economy could grow 4.5 percent this year, up from 3.5 percent seen in December, but ministry officials said political tension could throw that out of gear. On Sunday, Abhisit was locked in televised talks for almost three hours with leaders of the movement, who broadly support twice-elected former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, but Abhisit rejected ultimatums and said any solution would take time. He abruptly concluded the discussion when pressed about a timeframe for parliamentary dissolution. He left on Monday for a short visit to nearby Brunei, but was scheduled to return to resume the talks at 1100 GMT. One of the movement leaders, Jatuporn Prompan, said he would pick up where he left off. "What I asked him last night, I'll ask him again," he told reporters. DIVIDED COUNTRY Abhisit must call an election by the end of next year but insists the country is too divided to face a vote, which analysts say Thaksin's political allies are likely to win, raising the possibility of another judicial or military intervention. The embattled Abhisit says agreements have to be reached before house dissolution to prevent violence and ensure all parties can canvass without obstruction or foul play. Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaugsuban said on Monday that leaders of coalition parties supported the idea of house dissolution by the end of this year after amendments are made to the army-drafted 2008 constitution. "The proposal will be handed to the prime minister before he holds talks with the 'red shirts'," Suthep told reporters. After two weeks of peaceful rallies, the "red shirts" have intensified their campaign to topple the government, triggering fears of clashes between security forces and protesters and a flurry of negotiations to defuse tensions. It appeared they were responding to calls late last week by ousted former premier Thaksin, their assumed leader and financier, for a campaign of "civil disobedience". The threat of a flare-up by the protesters and a slew of mysterious but non-fatal grenade attacks and small bombings on government buildings, banks, and three state-controlled television stations have rattled the city of 15 million. The protests and symbolic attacks continue to draw attention to the deep divisiveness in Southeast Asia's second-biggest economy which has clouded the long-term outlook, with foreign investment pledges down 15 percent this year. Analysts have said Abhisit, who enjoys staunch backing of the military and Thailand's establishment elites, is unlikely to make any real concessions but wants to be seen to be reaching out to a movement he has long snubbed. The "red shirts" say Abhisit is beholden to the military because it secretly orchestrated defections that helped him form a government after a ruling pro-Thaksin party was di
