 Liton Haider Dhaka, Mar 29 (bdnews24.com)  The Dhaka water agency has said it could set up at least 10 new pumps in the capital to ease the current water crisis, but is not getting space for them from the city authorities. "There is water shortage everywhere," Golam Mostafa, chairman of the Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority, admitted on Monday. "More pumps could alleviate the water crisis significantly." City authorities Dhaka City Corporation and Rajuk are responsible for placing WASA pumps in the capital. Mostafa told bdnews24.com although it had the ability, in terms of funds, to set up 10 new pumps, the water agency could not get spaces at Badda, Gulshan and Uttara, among other hard-hit places. Just last week, Badda residents brought out demonstrations on two successive days on the Kuril-Biswa Road demanding proper water supply. The residents told bdnews24.com there is hardly any water in the pipeline and what little there is, "is foul". Badda union council chairman Ali Hossain told bdnews24.com that there are water pumps at every ward, but they cannot be operated at full capacity because of chronic power shortages. Mostafa said that the power crisis was hampering water supply in most areas of the capital. "In some areas, power outages last for 12 hours," he said. Regarding the water crisis in Badda, the WASA chief had said a generator and an additional water pump were being installed to address the issue "on an emergency basis". Mostafa told bdnews24.com on Monday that WASA could only produce 190 crore litres of water a day against Dhaka city's daily demand of 220 crore litres. There are 546 pumps under Dhaka WASA's 10 zonal offices. Of these, 293 pumps are run by generators. The WASA chairman said that if all the pumps could be run by generators, without depending on power supply, the water shortage could easily be resolved. ARMY TO GUARD PUMPS As temperatures rise in the capital, power and water crises are giving rise to the annual frustration and protests. Mostafa said, since water pumps were important installations, the military would be deployed at every WASA pump in Dhaka from April 1, "as in previous years, to avoid untoward situations". "We always take the army's help at this time every year," he said. Mostafa said that the problem would be alleviated if rains came within a month. "The army will be withdrawn once the situation improves," said the water chief. bdne
