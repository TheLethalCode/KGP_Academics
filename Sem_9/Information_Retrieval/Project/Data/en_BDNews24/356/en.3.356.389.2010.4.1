 David Bergman Dhaka, Apr 1 (bdnews24.com) The energy regulator has no estimate of how much energy would be saved from banning the use of air conditioners. The Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) on Tuesday banned the use of air conditioners in factories, offices and private homes in the evenings from 6-11pm. Bazlur Rahman, director of power division of the BERC, told bdnews24.com said that it had no idea of how many kilowatts would be saved. Nor could any official in Dhaka Power Distribution Company provide an estimate. In the past two days since the directive was issued, several shopping malls and supermarkets in the capital appeared to ignore the order. At the same time, senior lawyers have questioned whether the energy regulator has any legal authority to issue the ban. The man behind the decision to authorise the ban, Dr Salim Mahmud, a specialist in energy law and a member of BERC, however, continues to assert that it does have the authority "to give any directions to save energy". Two lawyers, however, told bdnews24.com that the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission Act 2003 does not give it the power to restrict energy use in this manner, and that even if it did, the Commission should have held a public consultation over the proposal. They also pointed to the arbitrariness of any enforcement that would be undertaken. On Tuesday, BERC issued an order banning the use of air conditioners in the evenings until further notice for all residences, private and public offices, businesses and shops. The order states that it is being issued under powers given to the regulator under two sub-sections of the 2003 Act. The Act gives BERC the power to "perform any related functions if considered appropriate by the Commission for the fulfillment of the objectives of this Act for electricity generation and energy transmission, marketing, supply, storage, efficient use, quality of services, tariff fixation and safety improvement." Senior advocate Dr M Zahir told bdnews24.com, "I do not think that this section covers the action by the government to ban the use of air conditioners for periods of the day." Supreme Court Advocate Dr Shahdeen Malik, director of law at BRAC University, also said that these sections "do not give the Commission the power to stop people using electricity. Where do these clauses say that the commission can stop consumers using any particular kind of equipment in their homes or offices? Will it ban the use of refrigerators tomorrow?" He added that, even if the BERC had been given the power to ban the use of electricity by consumers, it would first need to consult the parties affected by the measure. "BERC is not like the police. It cannot make a unilateral decision to impose this prohibition or that one. It is a regulatory body, and to make decisions of this kind it would need to hold public hearings inviting consumers, businesses to come." "BERC in fact does hold these kinds of hearings all the time," he pointed out. The lawyers also highlighted the difficulties of enforcing such a ban. "It is impossible to enforce," said Dr Malik, "The regulator has no inspectors who can do this. Whatever enforcement BERC tried to do would inevitably be selective. They may come to your house, but not the one down the street. When there is this kind of selectivity, then any enforcement would be considered to be arbitrary and unlawful." Dr Mahmud of BERC, did not accept these criticisms. "It has the authority to give any directions to save energy." Asked as to why there was no public consultation, Mahmud admitted that the BERC "does hold public hearings in the case of licensing, or price fixation, but in this case we didn't as we thought it was a very urgent matter." He added that there was no legal requirement to consult or hold hearings. On the issue of enforcement, Mahmud said BERC was gong to ask the utilities like DESA to do it. "Although we are not going to strictly enforce the order, we do expect moderate compliance, and the utilities have the resources to do this."
