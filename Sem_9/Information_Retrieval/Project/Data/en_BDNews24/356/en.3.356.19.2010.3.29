 Chittagong, Mar 29 (bdnews24.com)  Bus services on the Chittagong-Cox's Bazar route resumed on Monday morning after the bus owners called off their strike. The Chittagong-Cox's Bazar-Teknaf route Owners-Workers Coordination Council had imposed the strike in protest against an alleged incident of extortion by a local Awami League leader following the death of a child in a bus accident. The strike suspended road communication on Sunday between Chittagong city and southern districts, including Cox's Bazaar and Bandarban, stranding thousands of passengers. Cox's Bazar deputy commissioner Giasuddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com, that the decision to withdraw the strike came after a meeting on Sunday between the district administration, local Awami League leaders and representatives of owners and workers. If there is any obstruction preventing the resumption of the bus services, the administration will take action against those responsible, he said. A child was killed in a road crash on the Chittagong-Cox's Bazar highway on Mar 25. Local people detained the bus driver and conductor and handed them to the police. The bus owners claim that a local leader of the ruling Awami League intervened in the affair and demanded Tk 5 lakh saying that he would "negotiate the matter". They also claimed that the AL leader had threatened the bus operator whose bus was involved in the accident saying that its service would be stopped until he received the money.
