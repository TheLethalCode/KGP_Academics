 Dhaka, Apr 1 (bdnews24.com) The BNP has alleged that the Awami League candidate who is contesting the Bhola-3 by- election is violating the electoral code of conduct. The party again demanded deployment of the army in the by-election, though the Election Commission had earlier rejected this demand. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain on Thursday alleged that the candidate of the ruling party breached the electoral code of conduct by distributing sweets and bringing out processions when he submitted his nomination papers. "We have informed the Election Commission (EC) about the matter but no action has been taken yet," he said. "We doubt whether a fair election will be held there." AL candidate Md Nurunnabi Chowdhury Shaon and BNP candidate Hafizuddin Ahmed will contest for the Bhola-3 constituency, constituting of two upazilas --Lalmonhan and Tojuuddin - in the April 24 by-election. Delwar urged the EC to appoint presiding and polling officers who come from outside the two upazilas to keep the local administration fair. "Our candidate has already raised this issue. "According to the electoral law presiding officers should be appointed from other areas if the candidate objects, which is what we have donw," he said. The BNP leader claimed that the government has lost its popularity. "If the election is held properly the BNP candidate will win there." The by-election will test whether the government is popular or not, he said. Earlier the BNP had demanded mid-term elections. The EC declared the constituency vacant on Feb 3 as AL's Jashimuddin, a retired army officer, contested the 2008 general election before expiry of the stipulated waiting period. Electoral law stipulates that a government official, subject to compulsory retirement, cannot run in the election until five years after compulsory retirement. Jashimuddin was forced to retire from the army on Aug 31, 2004, and contested the general election in December 2008. He won the seat against BNP's Hafizuddin Ahmed, with a lead of 12,000 votes. Hafiz went on to challenge Jashim's candidacy at the High Court following which the seat was declared vacated.
