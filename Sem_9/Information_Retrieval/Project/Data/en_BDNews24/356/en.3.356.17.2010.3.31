 Dhaka, Mar 30 (bdnews24.com) --- BNP secretary general Khandakar Delwar Hossain termed the government's request for information from the BNP on war criminals "just for show". The veteran BNP leader was briefing journalists at his old Dhaka residence on Tuesday. He also questioned the government's sincerity about holding proper war criminals trials. Delwar said the "The government's call for a list of war criminals is just for show." He said that although the BNP has no objection to holding proper war criminals trials, the government is creating a list of war criminals according to its own whim and at the same time making political gain by harassing people. "So we are anxious about whether proper investigations and proper judgements will occur in the trials", the BNP leader said. He questioned the government's sincerity by saying that, "If the government was sincere about the trials, then they would have taken such a decision after consulting the opposition parties. But they did not do anything like that." The BNP secretary general thanked the party's supporters for making the Chittagong divisional conference successful. He claimed that "AL backed terrorists" tried to hamper the conference by barring party members at different places. Many BNP members from Rawjan and Rangamati could not come because of this, he said The BNP leader alleged that BNP "processions" were attacked by AL "terrorists" at various areas of Chittagong, including in the city's New Market area and on Kaptai road. He also said that police assisted the AL in conducting the attacks in "many" of the places. "AL's fascist mentality was revealed by these incidents", the BNP secretary general said. He denounced these kinds of activities of the government party. BNP's office secretary Rezvi Ahmed, assistant office secretary Asadul Karim Shahin and others were at the briefing.
