 Dhaka, Mar 29 (bdnews24.com)Applications for machine readable passports (MRP) will be available from April 1. However, special passports for emergency purposes will be available at Tk 1,000 even after April 1, a government statement said Sunday. The applications may be collected from 10 zonal offices around the country. The 48-page MRP has a validity of 5 years. The statement also said regular passport applicants who do not get their passports by Mar 31, will have to reapply for MRPs. Payable fees, however, will be ascertained on basis of payments already made. For getting a general MRP, fees are set at Tk 3,000 and Tk 6,000 for fast delivery. Earlier, officials told bdnews24.com that the passports expiring in March could be renewed for a year at Tk 1,000. There are about 1.25 core passport holders in the country. The passports that have already been renewed, will remain valid until 2015. After that, holders will be issued MRPs. Moreover, fees for MRPs abroad have also been put in place. Expatriates have to pay $100 and $200 for general and emergency MRPs respectively. Fees for the handwritten emergency passports issued from Bangladesh embassies will be $30, the statement said. bdnew
