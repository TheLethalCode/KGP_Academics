 LONDON, Mar 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain plans to support at least 500 athletes in the country's biggest team in more than a century at the 2012 London Games, the British Olympic Association (BOA) said on Wednesday. BOA chief executive Andy Hunt told Reuters that, despite the team being 50 percent bigger than the one that travelled to the 2008 Games in Beijing, they would not just be making up the numbers. Some of the extra athletes will be in sports where Britain has not previously been represented but can now do so as host nation. "We will not be taking any passengers," said Hunt. "This is not about an Olympic holiday in 2012. "This is about high performing, credible performance from every athlete that we will take to the Games. "But of course we have in mind, and all of sport has in mind, that this really is a once in a generation opportunity to allow some of these sports to participate. But they will have to be credible performances." Britain was represented by 676 athletes at the 1908 London Games and 375 when the Olympics next returned to the capital in 1948. The British team in Beijing that finished fourth in the medals table with 47 in total and 19 golds comprised 311 athletes. "Back in 1908 we had 676 but days have changed and it's really important that we have a really highly credible, high performing team and 500 is our intent," said Hunt. "A lot of sports will have host nation places. Because we are hosting the Games there will be places for sports like handball or volleyball and others where perhaps we haven't qualified in the past. "I do believe there is medal potential in some of these (new) sports and certainly the performance they have achieved so far on the journey to 2012 would indicate there is," added the chief executive. International qualifying standards for each sport in 2012 are expected to be published by federations and the IOC in the next few months and the BOA will then announce its own criteria. Hunt said the costs of supporting the expanded team would be similar to 2008 and still substantial, with the BOA receiving no government or lottery funding. "But we are confident that there will be a way to find the money to take such a large team," he said. "There are two years to go and we are working relentlessly with our partners both in the commercial and sporting world to make sure that gap is plugged." Hunt said matching the medal haul from Beijing was a good enough challenge on its own and fourth place in the table remained the goal for
