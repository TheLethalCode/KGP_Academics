 Dhaka, Mar 30 (bdnews24.com)Police withdrew from outside the Drik Gallery in Dhanmondi on Tuesday, eight days after forcing the gallery to close its exhibition 'Crossfire'. Since Mar 22, the police have stood guard outside the gallery during the exhibition's opening times, between 3 pm to 8 pm, preventing members of the public from entering. On Tuesday, they left early at 4.30 pm. "We suddenly realised that the police were not there" said Shahidul Alam, Drik's managing director. "They did not tell us they were leaving." Earlier today the High Court started hearing arguments on behalf of Drik challenging the closure of the exhibition. The court is due to give its decision tomorrow. The Officer-in-charge of Dhanmondi police station, Shah Alom said that the police were withdrawn for "routine duties". He said that it had nothing to do with what was happening at the High Court. Alom said that the police had no intention of returning as he did not think that the gallery would open the exhibition and he did not foresee any public gathering or public demonstration taking place. But Drik's managing director announced, after the police withdrawal, that it was extending the exhibition opening to the 14 April. It was due to close at 8pm on Wednesday. "We have done this due to public demand," Alam said. "Now that the police are not there people can come to see it." The exhibition contained images pertaining to 'crossfire' deaths that commonly involve Rapid Action Battalion among other law enforcers
