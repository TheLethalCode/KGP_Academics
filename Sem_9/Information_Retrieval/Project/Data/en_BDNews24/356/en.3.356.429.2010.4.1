<TITLE> Minister replies to SQ Chy with Zia challenge </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 01 (bdnews24.com)  The forest and environment state minister Hasan Mahmud has invited the BNP chairperson, Khaleda Zia, to run against him in his constituency. He made this comment in response to a similar challenge made by Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury, a BNP policy maker who on Wednesday challenged the prime minister to run against him. Whilst speaking about the government's initiative to bring war criminals to justice, Chowdhury had asked the prime minister to run against him in his Fatikchhari seat to find out how popular she really was. Mahmud said, however, that in the general election, Chowdhury had lost to him in Rangunia, considered Chowdhury's traditional seat and stronghold, by 30,000 votes. Mahmud said the popularity debate had been settled then. The state minister said he thought that the BNP MP was making these kinds of challenges only to create public confusion over the war crimes trial. But Mahmud said that the government was determined to go through with its initiative of trying those alleged to have committed war crimes. "It must be done to establish the rule of law," he said. bd
