 Dhaka, March 30 (bdnews24.com)The European Union has welcomed Bangladesh's decision to ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. In a press statement Tuesday, Catherine Ashton, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the Commission, said Bangladesh's ratification of the statute would encourage other Asian countries to do the same. "I warmly welcome the ratification of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court by Bangladesh on March 23," a EU press statement, issued from local office, quoted Ashton as saying. "This ratification, bringing the number of ICC state parties to 111, marks a further significant step forward in the international community's efforts to combat impunity for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide," said the EU representative. "I hope that this accession will encourage other countries in Asia to consider ratifying the statute", she said. "The European Union has long supported the ratification by Bangladesh of the Rome Statute and I am convinced that Bangladesh will make a highly valuable contribution to the court's work," reads the statement. The Awami League government on March 23 ratified the Rome Statue, ahead of its election pledge to try war criminals who aided the Pakistan army in 1971. The Pakistan army and their local collaborators killed an estimated three million people during the nine-month war of independence. The government has made it clear that the trial of Bangladesh's war criminals will meet international standards, although the ratification of the Rome Statute has no direct legal impact on the upcoming war crimes trials
