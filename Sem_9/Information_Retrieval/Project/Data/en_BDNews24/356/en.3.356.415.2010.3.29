<TITLE> New policy to open up int'l call sector </TITLE>

 Dhaka Mar 29 (bdnews24.com)  The cabinet has approved the draft of a new policy to bring down costs of international calls by further opening up the long distance telecommunications sector. According to the draft International Long Distance Telecommunications Service Policy 2010', the telecom ministry will award the licences and fix tariffs for international call terminations instead of the regulator BTRC. All other telecom licensing and tariff fixing, however, would remain under the jurisdiction of the Bangladesh Telecommunications Regulatory Commission. The approval came at a cabinet meeting on Monday with prime minister Sheikh Hasina in the chair, her press secretary Abul Kalam Azad said. The cabinet also gave the final nod to the Bangladesh Telecommunications (Amendment) Bill 2010. The country's international gateway was in the past controlled by the state-owned BTTB, now the BTCL, whose monopoly resulted in artificially high international call prices. In 2008, the government awarded VoIP licenses to five companies, who are now mainly responsible for handling international voice calls along with the state-run BTCL. But, according to licensing terms, the companies must pay hefty tariffs of over 50 percent to the government, making illegal VoIP trade, offering international calls at low charges, a lucrative business. The new revised policy is expected to further open up legal Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) operations and increase government revenue from the telecom sector. The telecom regulator, meanwhile, launched a crackdown earlier this month on unlicensed VoIP activities that has seen five PSTN operators and 19 ISPs shut down. The parliamentary standing committee on the telecoms ministry in April last year recommended further opening up of VoIP to stop illegal activity and raise government earnings. It said illegal VoIP had spread because of limited licencing. bdnews
