 MILAN, Apr 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Wasteful Inter Milan spurned a host of chances and needed a second-half strike from Argentine forward Diego Milito to beat CSKA Moscow 1-0 in their Champions League quarter-final, first leg Wednesday. Milito rifled in a right-footed shot into the bottom corner from the edge of the box in the 65th minute at the San Siro after a strong run by Wesley Sneijder. CSKA closed down Inter well in the first half, but showed little ambition as the Italian champions increased the tempo after the break. The hosts failed to put away a series of chances either side of Milito's goal, with CSKA keeper Igor Akinfeyev making some fine saves.

Mourinho's side, who ousted Chelsea in the last 16 but have been in poor form in Serie A recently, had the Russians under unrelenting pressure and Milito gave them their reward. Akinfeyev did well to deny Samuel Eto'o, Dejan Stankovic and Esteban Cambiasso and Pandev afterwards and Sneijder hit a great chance wide in the closing stages. Krasic and Aldonin will miss next week's return leg after being booked. "Today's result could not have been better, but it could have been worse," said CSKA coach Leonid Slutsky, adding that he does not think his club's artificial pitch will give them a big advantage in the second leg. "The synthetic pitch will not be fundamental for the teams. It has never been unfavourable to our riv
