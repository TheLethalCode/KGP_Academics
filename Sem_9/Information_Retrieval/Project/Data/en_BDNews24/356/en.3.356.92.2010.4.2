 Dhaka, Apr 2 (bdnews24.com)  The Dhaka Metropolitan Police arrested a money counterfeiter and arms businessman from a restaurant at Mohammadpur on Thursday evening. Police recovered a foreign pistol, about Tk 5 lakh and Rs 50,000 of counterfeit currency. The police said Mohammad Selim, 42, completed his master's in accounting from Dhaka University and took a job as a professor of a college at Kamrangirchar. But he quit soon and became involved with counterfeiters and weapons business. DMP police commissioner AKM Shahidul Haque told a press conference at the DB office, "Selim had connection with JMB, Laskar-e-Tayeba and different militant organisations. They used to get counterfeit money and weapons from him." He said, "Despite his high education, Selim became involved in crimes. He used to import counterfeit money from India and Pakistan and supplied them to different clients." Two years ago, the police had arrested Selim with the same charges. But Selim went back to his criminal activities once he was released. Selim acknowledged that he used to import money from border areas and sell them to different clients. He would buy counterfeit money for a fifth of their face value and sell them with margin. "I would sell counterfeit money with a face value of Tk 1 lakh for about Tk 25,000 to Tk 30,000." Police said that Selim was connected to other counterfeiters that the police had arrested before. Pakistani nationals, Md Danish, Sabbir, Rubina and Bangladeshis Sulaiman Masjmdar, Jahid and Fatema, arrested by the police, were apparently members of the crime ring. b
