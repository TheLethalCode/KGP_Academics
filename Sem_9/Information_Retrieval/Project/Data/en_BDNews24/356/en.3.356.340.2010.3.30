 bdnews24.com New Delhi correspondent New Delhi, March 29 (bdnews24.com)  The impasse over raw material supply to the Lafarge cement plant at Chhatak in Sunamganj is unlikely to end soon because of a ruling by India's Supreme Court. On Monday, the apex court asked French cement company to get a fresh Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) done before it could be allowed to resume limestone mining in the northeastern State of Meghalaya, bordering Sunamganj. A Forest Bench of the court comprising Chief Justice K G Balakrishnan and Justices S H Kapadia and Aftab Alam said it would not permit Lafarge to resume limestone mining without getting a fresh EIA done on the basis of the new guidelines of the Indian Government's Central Empowered Committee. On February 5, the apex court ordered to temporarily halt limestone mining by Lafarge Umiam Mining Private Limited (LUMPL) at Nongtrai in East Khasi Hills district of Meghalaya. The LUMPL is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Lafarge Surma Cement Limited (LSCL). The LUMPL had earlier been transporting limestone mined from Nongtrai to the cement plant of the LSCL and Spanish company Cementos Molins at Chhatak by a 17 kilometre long cross-border conveyer belt. The LSCL plant at Chhatak has a capacity of producing 1.5 million MT cement every year. India's Attorney General G E Vahanvati on Monday requested the Supreme Court to grant permission to Lafarge to carry on mining till the EIA is complete so that the supply of raw material to the cement plant in Chhatak could resume and the production was not hit there. But the Court turned down the attorney general's request. "We do not give permission without EIA," said the court. Indian Government last Wednesday told the Supreme Court that the latter's order halting mining and supply of limestone from Meghalaya to Lafarge's cement plant in Bangladesh is harming relations between the two neighbours. Vahanvati told the court that the order to halt limestone mining had hit production at the Lafarge's $255 million state-of-the-art plant at Chhatak. Lafarge too had told the Supreme Court that the Bangladesh government had written to the Indian High Commissioner in Dhaka on March 2 expressing concern over halting of limestone mining and supply to the cement plant at Chhatak. The Supreme Court halted mining on a plea from a local tribal organization that exploitation of natural resources by Lafarge at Nongtrai was posing a threat to environment and changing rainfall pattern in the eco-fragile area. Nongtrai is in the vicinity of Cherrapunji, which had once received maximum rainfall in the world and had earned the sobriquet  the wettest place on earth. The Shella Joint Action Committee (SJAC), a local organization, had filed a lawsuit alleging that rainfall in and around Nongtrai had decreased substantially due to large-scale denudation of forest caused by limestone mining by Lafarge. Indian Ministry of Environment and Forest in April 2007 had stopped the LUMPL's operation in Nongtrai. The Supreme Court, in an interim order on November 23, 2007, had allowed the company to continue mining. The SJAC alleged that LUMPL had obtained environmental clearance by misrepresenting to the Indian Government that it would carry out mining in "wasteland and non-forest area consisting mainly of barren land, and rocks" although the area had thick forest. Lafarge in an affidavit filed before the Supreme Court on March 16 admitted that it had mortgaged tribal land in Meghalaya to international banks to secure a loan of $153 million to finance its plant in Chhatak.
