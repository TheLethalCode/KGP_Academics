 Dhaka, Apr 2 (bdnews24.com) -- Pakistan's Twenty20 captain Shahid Afridi wants a psychologist to work with the players ahead of the big tournament, reports PTI. Afridi said he supported the idea of having a psychologist hold counseling sessions with the players in the training camp underway at Lahore. "The last time we had a psychologist work with the players before the Twenty20 World Cup in England it helped a lot," he said on Thursday. But Afridi made the point that it would be useless having a psychologist holding counselling sessions in the camp unless the players were ready to intake what he said. The Pakistani players had held sessions with psychologist Dr Babri before the Twenty20 World Cup and the Champions Trophy last year and the feeling was that he had a positive impact on them. Pakistan coach Waqar Younis also backed the idea and said he would be speaking to the board high-ups soon about it. "Right now we have not decided on having a psychologist in the camp but it is something we will speak to the board about because there is nothing wrong with it," he said. The former Pakistan captain said he himself was working hard on lifting the morale of the players after the recent events in Pakistan cricket. "The players need to believe in themselves if they want to achieve good results and my focus is on making them gel as a unit and improving their confidence levels," he said. Pakistan manager Yawar Saeed said since the camp started here this week, he had made it clear to the players that there would be a zero tolerance policy as far as discipline was concerned. "The board is very serious about discipline and we have told the players no violations would be tolerated at all, even if there is some serious breach of conduct while we are abroad the player will be sent back home immediately and I have the board's backing on this," Yawar
