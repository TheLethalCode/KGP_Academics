 Dhaka, Mar 30 (bdnews24.com) -- Australia look set for a 2-0 series victory following a productive day four of the second Test against New Zealand on Tuesday, reports BBC Sport. After setting an unlikely victory target of 479, Australia reduced the hosts to 185-5, with Mitchell Johnson (3-39) in impressive form in Hamilton. New Zealand's dwindling hopes rest upon Martin Guptill (29 not out) and Brendon McCullum (19 not out). Earlier, Marcus North (90), Michael Clarke (63) and Brad Haddin (48) pushed Australia to 511-8 declared. Vice-captain Clarke had added his 18th Test half-century before he was trapped lbw via the referral system to Brett Arnel in the morning session. North continued his aggressive intent, confidently stroking his way towards his fifth century as Australia extended their lead to over 400. But the left-hander fell 10 runs short of his century when he was brilliantly caught behind by wicketkeeper McCullum attempting to paddle sweep Daniel Vettori down the leg-side. The left-arm spinner, playing in his 100th Test match, removed Johnson with his very next delivery, but Australia broke the 500-mark courtesy of an enterprising knock of 41 from Nathan Hauritz, including five boundaries and two sixes. With New Zealand requiring a world record fourth-innings victory target, Australia captain Ricky Ponting declared the innings at lunch, giving his bowlers five full sessions to dismiss the hosts. The Black Caps made a solid start and had looked untroubled until opener BJ Watling was cleaned bowled by a superb Johnson delivery for 19 in the 14th over. And partner Tim McIntosh departed four overs later, edging an attempted drive to wicketkeeper Haddin to leave New Zealand at 53-2. Matt Sinclair and Ross Taylor, who struck a sensational century in the first innings, steadied the innings, taking the total past 100 at tea as Ponting combined seam and spin on a wearing Seddon Park pitch. And he was rewarded with three wickets in the final session as New Zealand's hopes of salvaging a draw evaporated. The consistent Johnson was rewarded with the prized wicket of Taylor, presenting Haddin with his second catch of the innings, while spinners Clarke and Hauritz accounted for Sinclair (29) and Vettori (22). Although Guptill and McCullum successfully guided the hosts to end without the loss of further wickets, Australia remain confident of wrapping up the victory early on the final day to end their summer season with yet another Test vic
