<TITLE> CHT Land Commission shifts 'closer to govt' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 30 (bdnews24.com)  The Chittagong Hill Tracts Land Commission has been allotted an office in Dhaka, 10 months after its formation, to allow for improved co-ordination with the ministries of land and CHT affairs. The housing and public works ministry has agreed to allocate an office on the fourth floor of Janata Tower in the capital's Karwan Bazar area for the commission, CHT land commission chairman justice Khademul Islam Chowdhury said. The process is underway to allocate this office, but it has not yet been formalised, said Mofakkharul Islam, senior information officer of the ministry. The Land Commission was formed in 2001 as part of the implementation of the Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord, but it never got off the ground due to lack of funds and manpower. After he was appointed as commission chairman on June 19 2009, justice Chowdhury said that he would start the land survey in the hill districts. Justice Chowdhury said that "We have our main office in Khagrachharhi and we will start our work there soon." The commission will also have branch offices in two other hill districts of Rangamati and Bandarban, he said. The Bangladesh government signed the accord with Pabatya Chattagram Janasanghati Saminit (PCJSS) in 1997 to end two decades of insurgency and establish permanent peace in the region. As part of the accord, the government pledged to pull out army troops in phases and resolve land disputes in the three hill districts. The incumbent government revived the land commission last year to resolve decades-long land disputes in the region.
