<TEXT>
 Sylhet, Apr 3 (bdnews24.com) The special BDR court in Sylhet has set June 28 as the date for the framing of charges against 14 BDR personnel from 8 rifles battalion who have been charged with mutiny. BDR chief Maj Gen Mainul Islam who headed the court set the date on Saturday in the presence of the accused. On Friday, the special court-3 at the BDR office in Akhalia Sadar, started the trial of the border guards, accused of siding with the Peelkhana mutineers. Nearly 60 army officers, deputed to the border force, were brutally killed on Feb 25 and 26 last year in the BDR headquarters of Peelkhna, while rebellion spread to other BDR outposts around the country. The government formed six special courts under BDR law last year, including two in Dhaka, to try about 3,500 border guards accused in some 40 cases in connection with the Pilkhana mutiny and associated rebellions in different districts. The special courts are only trying the charges of mutiny and rebellion, under BDR law. Trials of the other serious crimes, including murder, rape and arson, which are being investigated by CID, will be held in a civilian court. The first of the BDR trials began at Rangamati on Nov 24 against border guards accused of taking up arms in rebellion and solidarity with the Pilkhana mutineers. Special courts are holding similar trials in Feni, Satkhira and Thakurgaon. In the event of a guilty verdict by the special courts, the maximum penalty for mutiny or rebellion is seven years in jail. The killings at Pilkhana will carry the maximum penalty under ordinary criminal law. bd
