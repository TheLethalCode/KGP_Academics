<TITLE> Retired Yousuf has Pakistan Test future: PCB </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KARACHI, Mar 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Pakistan captain Mohammad Yousuf has a Test future and should reconsider his decision to retire from international cricket despite an indefinite ban, chief selector Mohsin Khan said. "Pakistan still requires him in test cricket and we have him in our plans for our upcoming tour to England," Khan told Reuters on Monday, hours after Yousuf, 35, had announced he was quitting the national side. Yousuf, who has played 88 Tests and 282 one-day internationals, and another former captain, Younis Khan, were banned indefinitely by the Pakistan Cricket Board earlier this month on the recommendations of an inquiry committee that looked into the team's poor performances in Australia and reports of infighting in the team. Yousuf, a fluent and elegant batsman who hit 24 Test centuries, accumulating 7,431 Test runs at an average of 53.07, told a news conference the PCB had told him he was a 'disruptive influence' and that he was considering appealing against the ban. "The PCB has said in its letter sent to me that I am a disruptive influence on the team and I would never want my presence to affect the team," Yousuf said. "I have always given my best for Pakistan and if they feel I am not a good influence on the team then it is better that I retire now. On any appeal, Yousuf added: "I have not decided as yet but I will take a decision soon, but it is obvious that I am disheartened with recent happenings because nothing has been more important for me then playing for Pakistan." Yousuf skippered Pakistan on the tours of New Zealand and Australia last year after then captain Younis asked to take a break from international cricket. DISMAL TOUR Pakistan were swamped 3-0 and 5-0 by Australia in the Test and one-day series. Yousuf, who won the International Cricket Council (ICC) Test batsman of the year award in 2006 for his record-breaking spree of run-scoring when he got nine centuries, originally retired from international cricket when he joined the unofficial Indian Cricket League in 2007 but later returned to play for Pakistan. "I have decided it is best that I retire from international cricket now but I will continue to play domestic cricket and in foreign leagues to keep in touch with the sport," Yousuf said. Former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq doubted whether his friend Yousuf would reverse his decision. "I don't think he will change his decision this time because he is extremely hurt at the way the board has made accusations against him and banned him," Inzamam said. "You don't treat senior players like this, there is total confusion and contradiction in the charges made against Yousuf by the inquiry commit
