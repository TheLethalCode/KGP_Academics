<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 30 (bdnews24.com)  Home minister Sahara Khatun said on Tuesday that she has directed the authorities to investigate how the Jamaat leader Mir Kashem was able to leave the country, admitting that she only learnt about his departure from newspaper reports. Several newspapers on Sunday reported that Kashem, a Jamaat executive committee member and former director of Islami Bank, left the country on Mar 24, just one day before the government established the war crimes tribunal and its investigation and prosecution agencies. The home minister had said on Friday that nobody accused of committing war crimes would be allowed to leave the country. A number of organisations have made allegations that Kashem had committed war crimes during the 1971 war. After Kashem's escape, the prime minister's adviser HT Imam said on Sunday that "despite their apparent escape", they would not be able to evade capture for long. News reports said Kashem was not only allowed to leave the country but he was also allowed access to the VIP room at the airport, where he waited to catch a Qatar airways flight to Saudi Arabia via Dubai.
