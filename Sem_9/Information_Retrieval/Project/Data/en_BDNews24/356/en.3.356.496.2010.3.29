 Dhaka, Mar 29 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has granted anticipatory bail to five senior members of Jamaat-e-Islami, including the party chief Matiur Rahman Nizami, in a case accusing them of hurting religious sentiments. The vacation bench of justice Shahidul Islam gave the order on Monday. He also ordered that the case be sent to the High Court's regular bench on Apr 4. Bangladesh Tariqat Federation filed the case on Mar 21 for comparing Nizami to Prophet Hazrat Muhammad (PBUH) by Dhaka City Jamaat amir Rafiqul Islam Khan at a Mar 17 meeting of the pro-Jamaat student front Islami Chhatra Shibir in the city. Various newspapers on Mar 18 reported Khan saying that the prophet in his lifetime was "tortured, falsified and conspired against" and "the same is happening in the case of Nizami". Others accused in the case are Jamaat secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed, executive committee member Delwar Hossain Saidee and the chief of Jamaat's Dhaka Metropolitan (South) unit ASM Yahia. The case complainant Syed Rezaul Haque Chandpuri, referring to Khan's statement as published in various newspapers, said, "He was audacious enough to compare the prophet with Nizami. Religious followers of the prophet were hurt by this comparison." b
