 Dhaka, Apr 4 (bdnews24.com) -- Mahela Jayawardene hit an unbeaten 110 as Kings XI Punjab thrashed Kolkata Knight Riders by 8 wickets in their IPL clash at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata on Sunday, reports Times of India. Jayawardene who played this match only because Shaun Marsh hurt his back in the warm-up, hit 3 sixes and 14 fours in his knock that came off 59 balls. Thanks to Jayawardene's century and Yuvraj Singh's unbeaten 16-ball 33, Punjab chased down the 201-run target with 10 balls to spare. Yuvraj hit 3 sixes and 2 fours in his breezy knock. Punjab lost their second wicket when Shane Bond had Kings XI Punjab captain Kumar Sangakkara caught by David Hussey at long-on. Sangakkara hit 2 sixes and 2 fours in his 22-ball 38. Murali Kartik clean bowled Manvinder Bisla (18) with an arm ball to give Kolkata Knight Riders the first breakthrough. Earlier, Chris Gayle's 42-ball 88, Sourav Ganguly's 31-ball 36 and Manoj Tiwary's 32-ball 35 enabled Kolkata Knight Riders to register the highest IPL total ever at the Eden Gardens. Angelo Mathews and David Hussey chipped in with unbeaten 17 and 11 respectively. Kolkata lost their third wicket when Irfan Pathan had Manoj caught by substitute Mohammad Kaif at long-on. Tiwary hit 2 fours in his 32-ball 35. Gayle hit 8 sixes and 6 fours in his 42-ball 88 before Juan Theron had him caught by Ravi Bopara at long-off. Gayle brought up his second IPL half-century (off 30 balls) and the Kolkata Knight Riders' 100 with a six over long-on off Bopara. Gayle's onslaught came after Bopara, bowling his first over, took a fine low catch on his follow-through to dismiss Ganguly. Ganguly hit a six and 5 fours in his knock that came off 31 balls and alongwith Gayle brought up his team's 50 in the sixth over after winning the toss and electing to bat. Kolkata dropped Mohnish Parmar and replaced by Jaydev Una
