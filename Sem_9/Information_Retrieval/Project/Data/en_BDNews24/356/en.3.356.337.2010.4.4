<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 4 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court's appellate division has upheld a High Court order that had ruled in Nov 2008 that the Anticorruption Commission (ACC) had lawfully investigated and filed its cases. The ruling means the graft watchdog can now continue with the prosecution of more than 500 cases currently stayed in the higher court, said ACC lawyer Khurshid Alam. The four-member Appellate Division bench headed by chief justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim gave the order on Sunday by dismissing an appeal filed by ruling Awami League MP Habibur Rahman Molla. The ACC had filed a case against Molla during the caretaker government regime alleging that he had illegally accumulated wealth. The High Court had given its order on Nov 20, 2008 following a petition by Molla challenging the legality of the case filed against him. ACC lawyer Alam termed Sunday's ruling "a milestone". The order clears the way to run Molla's graft case  as well as hundred's of other similar case - which are now pending in the Special Judge's Court, he said. bd
