 Dhaka, April 1 (bdnews24.com)  Food security is more important than attaining self-sufficiency, says eminent economist and first deputy chairman of Bangladesh planning commission, Nurul Islam. "Food security is a must, but not necessarily self-sufficiency," Prof. Islam said at a discussion on poverty reduction and global food security, organised by Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation in the capital on Thursday. "Food security means ensuring supply and thus keeping the price within the reach of people," he added. Asked whether he opposed the idea of attaining food sufficiency and providing agriculture subsidy, Islam said that if the local cost of producing food was higher than that of the international market, imports would be better. Recalling the experience of the food crisis of 2006 and 2007, he said the government should have a system of building 'food stock' to prevent such a scenario in the future. "The government should build food stock when the price is low and use that when needed," he added. Islam also said that food storage and processing is important in ensuring security. He emphasised on justifying agriculture subsidy and recommended that 'marginal farmers' and those who take risk should get the facility. "But not every one." Islam said that the real problem of food crisis is not necessarily supply shortage but the price. "Rice price is a factor of labour wage in the rural area and rise in food price increases the production cost as well," he said. Islam said, "Micro-credit can not alone increase food security for the poor, other social safety nets are important in achieving the goal." He said that if health care, infrastructure and other facilities are not developed then micro-credit will not work. He also emphasised joint participation of public and private sector in seed production and storage facility development
