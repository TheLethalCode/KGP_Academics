A yellow toy duckling, a mascot presented to the crew by Skvortsov's daughter, started floating freely after the first 10 minutes into the flight, indicating weightlessness. During the mission, the crew will receive three cargo ships and make two spacewalks -- one from the US segment of the station and one from the Russian part. Russia will ferry all crews to the station aboard its single-use Soyuz spaceships after US space agency NASA mothballs its shuttle fleet by the end of this year. Earlier this month, Russia announced a halt to space tourism to free capacity for ISS flights. It plans to double the number of launches to four this year as permanent crews aboard the ISS are set to rise to
