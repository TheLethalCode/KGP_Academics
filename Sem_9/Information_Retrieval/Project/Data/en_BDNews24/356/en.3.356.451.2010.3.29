 Feni, Mar 29 (bdnews24.com)The BDR special court in Feni resumed the trial of 62 suspected mutineers on Monday. The special court, set up at the 19 Rifles Battalion headquarters in Daganbhuiyan Upazila, began proceedings at 8:45am with BDR chief Maj Gen Mainul Islam heading the panel of three judges. 40 of the accused have so far this morning given their oral and written statements to the court. Previously, 58 of the 62 accused border guards pleaded guilty to acts of rebellion in Feni, sparked by the bloody mutiny at the BDR's Pilkhana headquarters in Dhaka last February, and sought pardon from the trial court. The special court resumed proceedings on Sunday after a two-month break. Up to Sunday, 22 of the 31 witnesses have given their testimony, said commander of 19 Rifles Battalion Lt Col Gazi Md Salahuddin, also prosecutor in the case. The remaining witnesses do not need to be heard, he said. Daganbhuiyan police filed a case last year accusing the border guards in Feni of armed rebellion in support of the Pilkhana mutiny. All 62 accused are being detained in Feni jail. Nearly 60 army officers, deputed to the border force, were brutally killed on Feb 25 and 26 at Pilkhana, while rebellion spread to other BDR outposts around the country. Among the acts of rebellion during that time, a contingent of Feni border guards took up arms, fired shots in public and blocked the Feni-Maizdi Road on Feb 26. Six special courts, including two in Dhaka, are trying some 3,500 border guards accused in some 40 cases around the country. bd
