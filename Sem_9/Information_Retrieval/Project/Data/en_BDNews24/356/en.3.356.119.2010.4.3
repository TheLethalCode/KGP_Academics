 Rajshahi, Apr 3 (bdnews24.com)Police has arrested Chhatra League activist Kawser Hossain, previously suspended over for beating up a female student. He was detained from a room of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Hall of Rajshahi University at 11am on Saturday. Kawser is a fourth year student of marketing. Motihar police chief Tofazzal Hossain Khan told bdnews24.com: "Kawser is under police custody. Legal steps will be taken against him." Kawser on Thursday evening beat a third year student of Bangla department in front of Taposi Rabeya hall. Earlier, at the end of last year, the university authority fined Kawser for beating up the same girl. The girl's companions said that Kawser beat her because she refused to date him. Some 400 girls of the Taposi Rabeya hall submitted a memorandum to the authority protesting against the incident, demanding suspension of Kawser from the university. Different organisations also demanded Kawser's trial. BCL RU unit president Awal Kabir said Kawser had no connection with the Chhatra League. He faced temporary suspension from the party for unbecoming behaviour. RU proctor Md Zakaria told bdnews24.com: "The authority will duly consider the demands raised by the students." bdnews24.co
