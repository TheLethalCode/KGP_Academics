 Dhaka, Apr 4 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh has asked India which goods she intends to transport through the Akhaura-Ashuganj route to the north-eastern states. Shipping minister Shahjahan Khan made the query when Indian high commissioner in Dhaka Rajeet Mitter called on him on Sunday. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina during her India visit in January agreed to allow the neighbour use of the route. The minister told journalists after the meeting that the query is part of the formalities before commencement of bilateral trade. He said he discussed with the Indian envoy declaring Ashuganj in Bangladesh and Silghat in India as ports of call in the Protocol on Inland Water Transit and Trade (IWTT) signed between the two countries. During Hasina's visit, the two countries agreed to declare Ashuganj and Silghat as ports of call in the protocol, which would be amended through exchange of letters. Khan said India assured Bangladesh of extending its assistance in river excavation. "They (India) have agreed to give us nine dredgers, which will be handed over soon," he said. The minister also discussed transit to Nepal and Bhutan with Mitter. He said the government is mulling over establishment of three new land ports at Jibannagar, Ashuganj and Haluaghat to boost trade with India. Shipping secretary Abdul Hannan was present at the meeting.
