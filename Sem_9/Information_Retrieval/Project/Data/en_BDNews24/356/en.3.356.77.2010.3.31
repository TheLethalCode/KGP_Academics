<TITLE> Protest lawfully, but govt won't stand anarchy: Ashraf </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 30 (bdnews24.com)---The government will allow any lawful demonstration or movement but will spare none who try to create anarchy in the country, local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam said on Tuesday. The statement came in reaction to opposition leader Khaleda Zia's rallying call the previous day for an "anti-government campaign". "Today is a warm-up rehearsal. Get ready for movement," the BNP chief had told thousands of her party supporters a grand rally in Chittagong on Monday. Ashraf told a press conference at Awami League chief's political office at Dhanmondi Tuesday: "BNP has called for movement to thwart trial of war criminals." "BNP does not want that their friends like Golam Azam, Nizami and Sayeedee be tried on charges of war crimes," said Ashraf, who is also general secretary of the Awami League. He also alleged many high-profile BNP leaders themselves were war criminals. At the same time, he reiterated his call to BNP asking it to provide the government with information of war criminals, if any. "The prime objective of the government is to try the war criminals, give democracy a solid shape, uproot corruption and ensure good governance," he added. Ashraf ridiculed Khaleda's claim that she was injected with sleeping drugs by the past caretaker government in an attempt to forcibly eject her from Bangladesh. He went on to reject all Khaleda's criticisms of the government in turn, including her allegation that recent agreements signed with India went against independence and sovereignty and that BNP had kept rice prices down while AL had let them spiral. bd
