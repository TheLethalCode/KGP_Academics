<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 4 (bdnews24.com)  A joint force of RAB and armed police will be deployed from Apr 21 for the upcoming Bhola - 3 by polls. Home secretary Abdus Sobhan Shikder told journalists about the development after a meeting between the Election Commission and law enforcers on Sunday. Meanwhile, despite demands of the opposition BNP, the EC has decided not to deploy the army. The meeting presided over by chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda was attended by the two election commissioners, commission secretary, top officials of law enforcement agencies, including the police inspector general, and the Bhola district administration. Responding to a query, the home secretary said, "Sufficient number of law enforcers will be deployed to ensure that a free and fair poll is held. The joint force will be deployed from Apr 21-25, he said. "Other than this armed law enforcers would be on duty at the poll centres from Apr 23-25." "A police sub inspector will lead an armed team of 24 police, Ansar and VDP members for ensuring law and order around the poll centres. An executive magistrate will lead the force," Shikder said in answer to another query. In accordance with the laws and regulations, a mobile court led by a judicial magistrate will be formed to hold summary trials on the poll day. The CEC also said that according to local reports, there is still no probability of trouble during the polls. "So we have decided not to deploy the army, yet." Regarding the riskier poll centres, he said that the election commissioners will go to Bhola and conduct polls there. "Closes-circuit cameras would also be placed at all centres deemed risky." A total of 2,23,926 voters will vote for their representative at 86 poll centres in the constituency on Apr 24. BNP's Hafizuddin Ahmed and AL's Nurunnabi Chowdhury Shaon received final nominations and are expected to be the main rivals. However, former AL candidate Md Jashimuddin has not withdrawn his application yet and is still among the contenders. The last day of withdrawing from the polls is Apr 8. CAMPAIGN REGULATIONS The election commission has already urged the prime minister to issue directives asking government ministers, state ministers, deputy-ministers or anyone of the same level to refrain from taking part in election campaigns. The commission also urged the speaker to ask MPs from campaigning. bdnew
