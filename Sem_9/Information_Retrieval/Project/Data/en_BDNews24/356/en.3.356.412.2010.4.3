<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 3 (bdnews24.com)  State minister for law Qamrul Islam said Saturday that crimes against humanity and war crimes are parts of the same category of offences committed during the war of liberation. He was speaking at a programme on trials of war criminals organised by Bangabandhu Academy at Dhaka Reporters' Unity. The state minister made the comment just a day after the BNP voiced scepticism over the tribunal formed last week by the government to try those suspected of war crimes in 1971. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain on Friday said that the government is moving away from "war crimes trials", as pledged before the national elections and talking about "holding trials for crimes against humanity". He also said, "It is possible to judge crimes such as murder, looting, arson, rape and abduction under the current penal code. There is no need to form a special court, tribunal or investigation agency for that." Qamrul said on Saturday that Delwar was intellectually dishonest and he should not have made such comments as a lawyer. "He has done this deliberately." He said that the BNP is simply trying to thwart the trial process in an effort to save the alleged war criminals. They (BNP) have been saying from the very beginning that they would support the government if the trial was fair, he said "They appointed Shah Aziz, an alleged war collaborator, as a prime minister and made another collaborator Matin, a minister." Shah Azizur Rahman was the prime minister during the regime of late president Ziaur Rahman, and Abdul Matin was the home minister in Khaleda Zia's first term as prime minister in 1991-96. "We are only holding trial of those who are accused of murders, looting, rape and arson." He claimed that there are war criminals within BNP. He urged BNP not to confuse people by giving wrong explanation. The government on Mar 25 named the three-member war crimes tribunal and its seven-member investigation and 12-member prosecution teams to hold trials relating to crimes committed in 1971. bdnews
