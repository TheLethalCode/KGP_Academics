 Dhaka, Mar 29 (bdnews24.com)A regional approach was stressed on Monday to tackle the economic and social fallout from millions of people being displaced by climate change in South Asian countries including Bangladesh in coming years. Participants at a two-day seminar in the capital, on Security Implications of Climate Change in South Asia, stressed a regional approach to alleviate the worst impact of displacement. Bangladesh alone estimates more than 20 million people will become refugees in the coastal area in coming decades because of rising sea-levels. The country is reportedly one the most vulnerable to climate change in the world, according to a report released at last year's Copenhagen Climate Conference. "People will be forced to shift livelihoods because of the effects of climate change," Maj Gen (retd) Muniruzzaman, president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies, one of the organisers, said. "We have to identify other impacts more specifically," he said. "Though the current (climate change) strategy paper of the government says that about 20 million people will be made refugees, it doesn't specify the after effects or how to address that situation." Dan Smith, an official of International Alert, an independent peace-building organisation, said, "Since most of the countries of South Asia will suffer from climate change, no one will be able to tackle the situation alone." He suggested formation of an alliance, like the European Union, to deal with the issue. "The alliance should include more countries, not only those of the South Asia," he added. Muniruzzaman said, "A regional organisation like SAARC can play the most effective role in this connection." He said recommendations from the present discussion will be placed in the next SAARC summit. The round-table was jointly organised by BIIPS, the Peacebuilding and Development Institute in Sri Lanka and International Alert. bdne
