 KALAYA, Pakistan, Apr 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani forces backed by tanks and artillery repulsed Taliban attacks in northwestern Orakzai on Sunday, killing nearly 40 militants, a government official said. Orakzai, southwest of Peshawar, has become a Taliban hub since security forces mounted offensives against their strongholds in other parts of the ethnic Pashtun northwest over the past year, security officials say.

He said only one government soldier was wounded in the clashes. There was no independent confirmation of Khan's casualty tolls but a security official, who declined to be identified, gave similar figures in the clashes. Pakistan's action against militants over the past year has won US praise and eased fears that the militants could threaten the state or even seize its nuclear arsenal. Pakistani action against militants along its Afghan border is seen as crucial to US efforts to bring stability to Afghanistan, particularly as Washington sends more troops there to fight a raging Taliban insurgency before a gradual withdrawal starts in 2011. According to security officials, about 170 militants have been killed in several weeks of clashes in Orakzai, but there has been no independent verification of the figures. Orakzai was a stronghold of Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud who is widely believed to have been killed in a US drone strike in the North Waziristan region on the Afghan border in Janu
