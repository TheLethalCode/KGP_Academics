<TITLE> Corruption deepens poverty in Afghanistan - UN report </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 GENEVA, Mar 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Corruption is entrenched in Afghanistan, leaving the poor at the mercy of the powerful while security-obsessed international forces often turn a blind eye to abuses, a United Nations report charged on Tuesday. Despite $35 billion injected into the economy since 2002, one in three Afghans, or 9 million people, live in absolute poverty while another third survive just above the poverty line, it said. "A key driver of poverty in Afghanistan is the abuse of power.

The UN report said that political power is exercised on the basis of personal relationships, leaving Afghans "subject to the fickle and shifting allegiances of patronage politics." "Corrupt practices are entrenched and resented but even the poor, where they can, will provide bribes to get a service, furthering a high level corruption that, given a weak judiciary and few effective oversight mechanisms, remain unpunished." The 26-page report is based on the results of a survey conducted in 14 provinces, interviews with officials and community leaders as well as research by groups including Oxfam. Many communities believe, rightly or wrongly, that food aid had been either embezzled or diverted elsewhere, it found. "In addition, many Afghans perceive international actors as primarily interested in short-term objectives rather than challenging entrenched and abusive power structures," it sa
