 Dhaka, Mar 31 (bdnews24.com)- The War Crimes Facts Finding Committee, a private organisation that has long worked for the trial of 1971 war criminals, has offered to contribute documentary evidence for the government's trial process. The committee has sent letters to the government's newly-formed war crimes tribunal, investigation agency and prosecution panel. "We've many documents and other evidence regarding the war crimes," MA Hassan, convener of the committee, told bdnews24.com. "It'd be a defeat for the nation, if the trials fail due to lack of evidence," he added. According to the letter, the committee wants to meet the tribunal members, investigators and prosecutors to hand over its reported evidence. "The organisation has sought permission to provide us information, including a list of alleged war criminals and books on the crimes committed during the Liberation War," the investigation agency chief Abdul Matin told reporters Wednesday. He said the war crimes agency would discuss the matter. bdn
