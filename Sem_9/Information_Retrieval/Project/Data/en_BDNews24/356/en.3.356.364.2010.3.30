<TITLE> 'No escape for escaped war criminals' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 28 (bdnews24.com)  With reports of at least one alleged war criminal Mir Kashem Ali leaving the country, the prime minister's adviser HT Imam said Sunday that "despite their apparent escape", they would not be able to evade capture for long. His comments came after several newspapers reported Sunday that Kashem, Jamaat executive committee member and director of Islami Bank, left the country on Mar 24. His apparent getaway raised many eyebrows following recent utterances of several senior government leaders including home minister Sahara Khatun, who said that nobody accused of committing war crimes would be allowed to leave the country. News reports said Kashem was not only allowed to leave the country but he was also given the VIP room at the airport, where he waited in the morning to catch a Qatar airways flight to Saudi Arabia via Dubai. The government is said to be investigating as to how he escaped. The disclosure on Sunday about Kashem's escape and his use of VIP room have come as a big embarrassment for the government of Sheikh Hasina, who vowed on Saturday that no "branded war criminals" would be spared and their "thousands of crores of taka" would not help them. In an apparent exercise in damage control, her adviser Imam said, "The world has become very small now. Even if war criminals escape to other countries, they won't be able to get away. The government will make them face trials". He also said that there are no international pressures to stop the trials, apparently to dampen speculation that some power countries including Saudi Arabia and the United States are asking to government not to proceed further on the matter. The adviser, however, expressed fears that the trials might be sabotaged, saying, "The war criminals have made a lot of money from profitable businesses like banks, insurance companies, educational institutions and media. They are trying to thwart the trials with this wealth." Responding to a query about plans to confiscate wealth of war criminals and their financial sources, he said "It cannot be disclosed publicly." The advisor also said that the alleged war criminals have been involved with other crimes including the BDR mutiny. He was talking at a three-day seminar titled "Governance Reform through ICT application" at Bangladesh Public Administration Training Centre. Representatives from 12 countries including US, UK, Australia and Japan are participating in the seminar. b
