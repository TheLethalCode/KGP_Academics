<TEXT>
 Feni, Mar 29 (bdnews24.com) The special court in Feni has set April 18 as the date when it will give its verdict on the cases against 62 BDR men charged with committing munity. BDR chief Maj Gen Mainul Islam, who chaired the special court, set up at the 19 Rifles Battalion headquarters in Daganbhyiuan upazila, set the date at the end of proceedings on Monday. The court began at 8:45am and ended at around 1pm. After forty of the accused gave their oral and written statements to the court Lt Col Gazi Salauddin, the prosecutor, delivered his arguments. He described the incidents that took place on Feb 25 and 26 last year and demanded punishment for the mutineers. One of the acts of rebellion that is alleged to have taken place involved, a contingent of Feni border guards taking up arms, firing shots in public and blocking the Feni-Maizdi Road on Feb 26. Previously, 58 accused pleaded guilty to acts of rebellion in Feni, sparked by the bloody mutiny at the BDR's Pilkhana headquarters in Dhaka last February, and sought pardon from the trial court. The remaining four border guards have retracted their earlier confessions to the court. The special court resumed proceedings on Sunday after a two-month break. 22 witnesses have altogether given their testimony, said commander of 19 Rifles Battalion Lt Col Gazi Md Salahuddin, also prosecutor in the case. Daganbhuiyan police filed a case last year accusing the border guards in Feni of armed rebellion in support of the Pilkhana mutiny. All 62 accused are being detained in Feni jail. Nearly 60 army officers, deputed to the border force, were brutally killed on Feb 25 and 26 at Pilkhana, while rebellion spread to other BDR outposts around the country. Six special courts, including two in Dhaka, are trying some 3,500 border guards accused in some 40 cases around the country. bd
