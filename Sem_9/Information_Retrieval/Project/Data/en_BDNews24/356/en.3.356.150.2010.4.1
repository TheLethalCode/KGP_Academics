 Dhaka, Apr 1 (bdnews24.com)  Law minister Shafique Ahmed has confirmed that the recently established war crimes tribunals relating to offences committed during the 1971 will follow "international standards". He also said that the war crimes trials are being organised only to hold people to account for the crimes they have committed, and not for any political purpose. The minister made these comments following his meeting with UN resident coordinator Renata Lok Dessallien who herself told reporters that the UN wants that the trial to be fair, neutral and of international standard. "The government is holding the trials to establish rule of law, not out of political vengeance," Ahmed told reporters at the Secretariat on Thursday. The minister made the statement one day after BNP standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain said that the government was holding the trials out of political revenge. In relation to comments made by BNP leaders that there were war criminals inside the ruling Awami League the minister said: "The investigation agency has been assigned to find the criminals. Nobody should comment on this issue." Ahmed said that the judges are very experienced, and there is therefore no scope to doubt the integrity of the trial. He said the government would welcome any United Nation observers.
