 Dhaka, Apr 2 (bdnews24.com) -- Former captain Younis Khan is planning to take the Pakistan Cricket Board to court over the indefinite ban imposed on him since last month, reports PTI. Sources close to Younis said that his lawyer, Ahmed Qayyum had advised him that instead of filing an appeal with the PCB, it would be a better option to file a case in court over the ban.
