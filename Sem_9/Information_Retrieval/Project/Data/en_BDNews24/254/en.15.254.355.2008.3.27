<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 27 (bdnews24.com) Detained former prime minister Sheikh Hasina must be sent abroad for better treatment, ophthalmologist Prof Syed Modasser Ali has recommended in a letter to the chief adviser. The AL leader's personal physician, Prof Modasser told bdnews24.com Thursday that he had delivered the "semi-official letter" in person to the CA's office. He said authorities of Square Hospital, where Hasina is undergoing treatment, have already admitted through the media their limitations regarding proper treatment of her ear ailment. "Any delay in addressing the emergency might result in total loss of hearing." "That's why I have appealed to the chief adviser to urgently take necessary steps for Sheikh Hasina's ear treatment in the US," Modasser said. Hasina had earlier gone to the US for treatment of her ear following the August 21, 2004, grenade blasts. Prof Modasser said he therefore requested the CA to allow arrangements for affording the detained former prime minister to be treated in the US again. bdnews24.c
