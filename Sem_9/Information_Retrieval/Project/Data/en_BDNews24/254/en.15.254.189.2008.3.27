<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 27 (bdnews24.com) The Election Commission will ask the speaker to remove members of parliament from their posts if they provide inaccurate information on their nominations, election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain said Thursday. "Providing eight pieces of information, including an income and expenditure statement, an account of election spending and educational qualifications are now mandatory," Sakhawat told reporters in his office. The commissioner said a court order had been made regarding the move. Anyone discovered providing inaccurate or false information in any of the categories will have their candidature cancelled by the Election Commission, he said. "If it is discovered that inaccurate information was supplied after the election, the election commission will request the speaker to cancel the offender's parliament membership," Sakhawat said. The election commissioner said candidates to local government elections would be subject to the same conditions. The commission also will seek the removal of an individual who had breached the rules and already been elected to a local government body. The commissioner said the new requirements are being included in the Representation of People Order 1972. Sakhawat said district level investigation committees would be set up to detect inaccurate or falsified information through scrutiny of a candidate's nomination papers. On a separate issue, the commissioner said the schedule for elections to the four city corporations and seven municipalities where the tenure had expired would be announced after the amended local government ordinance comes from the ministry. The Election Commission is slated to hold elections to Rajshahi, Khulna, Barisal and Sylhet city corporations from April 22 to May 29. Over the same period, elections to Shariatpur, Sitakunda, Cox's Bazar, Gopalganj, Sreepur, Fulbaria and Manikganj municipalities will be held. To avoid a clash, the SSC examinations this year will be held prior to the upcoming local government polls, while the HSC examination starts on May 29, when they are completed. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda has requested the caretaker government to either withdraw or relax the state of emergency and introduce indoor politics across the country ahead of the local polls. bdnew
