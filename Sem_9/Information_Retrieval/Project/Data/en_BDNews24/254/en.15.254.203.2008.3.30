<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 29 (bdnews24.com)The 'City Centre' building, an under construction high-rise in the Motijheel business district of Dhaka, appears to be suffering structural damage before completion. Security guard at the building Ruhul Amin told reporters Saturday: "The wall on the west side of the building started developing cracks a little before noon. It created panic among people." Ruhul Amin said fire service personnel had evacuated the building in the afternoon. Dhaka City Corporation mayor Sadek Hossain Khoka, who visited the site Saturday evening, said that the building was being "examined". The brick wall of the first two storeys was badly affected, but the building "on the whole was not damaged", Khoka added. Witnesses had earlier said that the wall on the west side of the building was leaning a little inward, and there were cracks developing in the brickwork of the building's front side, with some bricks having fallen out. On hearing of the development, hundreds of curious people thronged the city's downtown commercial area. The mayor said that he had informed the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology and the Army Engineering Corps of the matter. They were expected to submit a report following investigation Sunday. On how the situation would affect people who had their offices in nearby buildings, Khoka said: "We are giving more importance to security of life and property than the building. Everything is being done to ensure that security." However, he refused to term the building "risky" ahead of any expert opinion. To the east of City Centre lies the Uttara Bank head office; to the south lie Janata Bank Tower and Karim Chamber; to the north are the BCIC and National Life Insurance buildings. The high-rise was designed to comprise 37 floors of office space, a convention centre, a business lounge, gymnasium, food court, recreational areas and a garage. It is being developed by the Orion Group, which is also an established partner of UAE-based Belhasa Group that constructed the 7-star hotel Burj Al Arab in Dubai. bdnews24
