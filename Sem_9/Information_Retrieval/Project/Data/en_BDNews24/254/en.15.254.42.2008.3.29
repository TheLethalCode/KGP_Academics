 BRDO, Slovenia, March 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)- European Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn stepped up criticism on Saturday of an attempt by Turkish state prosecutors to close the ruling AKP party, saying it could jeopardise Ankara's EU entry talks. "This episode has revealed a system error in Turkey's constitutional framework that may need to be addressed through a constitutional amendment," he told a news conference after EU foreign ministers met with Turkish Foreign Minister Ali Babacan. Rehn said much was at stake for Turkey's EU aspirations when members of the Constitutional Court meet on Monday to consider whether the prosecutor's case, accusing the Islamic-rooted AKP of subverting the secular order, is admissible. In a normal European democracy such political issues should be debated in parliament and decided through the ballot box, not in the courts, he said. Under Council of Europe guidelines, a party could only be banned if it practised or advocated violence to overthrow the democratic constitutional order. Asked what impact a decision by the court to ban the AKP and bar top politicians such as President Abdullah Gul and Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan from office could have, Rehn said Brussels was obliged to review the negotiating process in case of a serious and persistent breach of EU political and human rights criteria. "It is important that the Turkish government would now keep its calm and nerves and keep up the momentum of the reform process despite this disturbance," he said, underlining the urgency of changing a key law on freedom of expression. Babacan told Turkish reporters he had renewed Ankara's commitment to EU-driven reforms and aimed to enact a reform of article 301 of the penal code, used to prosecute writers and intellectuals for "insulting Turkishness", in May or June. Turkey began EU membership talks in 2005 but has made slow progress, partly because of the unresolved conflict over the divided Mediterranean island of Cyprus but also due to deep misgivings in some EU member states, notably France and Austria. Babacan said the EU and Turkey were ready to open accessions negotiations soon on three more of the 35 policy areas into which EU law is divided -- intellectual property, the free movement of capital and company law.
