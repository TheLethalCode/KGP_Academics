<TEXT>
 LONDON, March 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Teenager Alexandre Pato marked his international debut on Wednesday with an astonishing opportunist goal to give Brazil a 1-0 win over Sweden in a friendly at the Emirates Stadium. The 72nd-minute strike was the one fitting moment of a match marking the 50th anniversary of Brazil's victory over Sweden in the 1958 World Cup final in Stockholm for the first of their five titles. The 18-year-old chased Rami Shaaban towards the right touchline as the substitute goalkeeper looked set for an easy clearance and contrived to block the ball, swivel and send an exquisite left-footed lob into the unguarded net. "It was flawless, a perfect volley, but he also had a little bit of luck," Sweden coach Lars Lagerback told a news conference. Brazil coach Dunga was characteristically low key about the strike but praised Pato for his commitment. "Let's not exaggerate (the goal's brilliance), but it was an important goal," said Brazil's 1994 World Cup-winning captain. "(Pato) has technical quality, but I liked how he went to put the goalkeeper in difficulty," he added. "He has everything to be a crack (player), but let's see (how good he is) after 40 games." MISSED CHANCES The goal from the second-half substitute followed several chances that went beggingmidway through the first half and early in the second. Sweden striker Markus Rosenberg shot wide after a long run halfway down the field on the right when he would have done better to pass square to the unmarked Johan Elmander on his left. Brazil charged down the other end and goalkeeper Andreas Isaksson, who came off at halftime, made two saves in quick succession from Julio Baptista and Luis Fabiano. In Sweden's next attack, Julio Cesar went down low to save Elmander's downward header from a cross from the right. Sweden were close again early in the second half with Julio Cesar diving to push out Sebastian Larsson's free kick from the left and the ball being cleared off the Brazil line from a corner a minute later. Brazil playmaker Diego, put through by Pato just past the hour, had his legs clipped by substitute Mikael Dorsin inside the box as he went for goal but the Brazilians' heated demands for a penalty were turned down. Julio Cesar made a late point-blank save from Rosenberg who should have done better than shoot straight at the keeper as Sweden looked for an equaliser. "We have to be sharper when it really matters...we're not good enough (in front of goal)," said Lagerback. "We got just what we wanted, a really good test against a great team...Now we must work on that final pass," he added, looking ahead to preparations for Sweden's participation in Euro 2008 in Switzerland and Austria in June. Dunga's Brazil have now won two and lost one of their three friendlies at the Emirates after a victory over Argentina in 2006 and a loss to Portugal last year. They also beat Wales at White Hart Lane in 200
