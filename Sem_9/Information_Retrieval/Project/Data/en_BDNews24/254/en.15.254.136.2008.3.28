<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 28 (bdnews24.com)  Bikalpadhara Bangladesh chief AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury Friday demanded that the government launch open market sales of food at reduced prices in the regions, hardest-hit by disasters last year. "The struggle for survival comes first, then democracy," Chowdhury said at an Independence Day discussion at the Dhaka Reporters Unity. The former president suggested that cultivation of tobacco and jute be stopped to produce more foodstuffs. He also asked the government to stop the non-labour development projects and import food with that money, saying the government has to be careful to save the country from a famine. "Prices of essentials are now our main problem. This problem must be solved." He criticised the government, saying: "Some advisers say we have a record reserve (foreign currency reserve in the central bank). But the people would not enjoy it." On the trial of the war criminals, Chowdhury said: "War criminals can be tried anytime." He referred to the trial of war criminals in Israel and Germany. Chowdhury said they gave a nine-point proposal to resolve the crisis of the country but the proposal had been misinterpreted. "We wanted to form a national government on the basis of the proposal. The tenure of the government would be 10 years," he said. bdnew
