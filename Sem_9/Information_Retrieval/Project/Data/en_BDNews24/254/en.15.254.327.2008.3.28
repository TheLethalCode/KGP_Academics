<TITLE> UK Q4 c/a gap shrinks sharply, GDP up 0.6% </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, March 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's current account deficit shrank sharply from a record high to its smallest since mid-2005 in the final quarter of last year as foreign-owned banks suffered at the hands of financial market turmoil. The Office for National Statistics said on Friday the current account gap narrowed to 8.458 billion pounds in the three months to December, equivalent to 2.4 percent of GDP, from 19.063 billion in Q3. Analysts had predicted an 18 billion pound gap. The figures may provide some support to the pound which has fallen sharply in recent weeks on a trade-weighted basis on concerns about the UK's external position. However, the current account gap for 2007 as a whole amounted to 4.2 percent of GDP - the highest since 1989. The Office for National Statistics said GDP growth in Q4 was unrevised at 0.6 percent, but trimmed the annual rate to 2.8 percent -- the lowest rate since mid-2006.
