 CAIRO, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Main Egyptian stock indexes ended slightly higher on Wednesday, with selling pressure on heavyweights such as Orascom Telecom offsetting a bullish performance by textile stocks. The benchmark Case 30 index rose 0.5 percent to 11,113.45 points while the well-watched Hermes index ended 0.6 percent higher at 97,441.35 points. The broader CIBC-100 index rose 1.9 percent to 556.42 points. Orascom Telecom, the fourth-biggest Arab telecom operator by market value, last traded 1.3 percent lower at 73.54 Egyptian pounds ($13.45) a share. "There is minor technical resistance at 75 pounds on OT," Mohamed Kotb of Al Jazira Asset Management said. "The market in general was trading sideways today. People are still hesitant ... so they cash profit once they can." Egyptian blue-chip shares have had a rocky ride in March, with concerns about a global credit crisis offsetting bullish recommendations and strong fundamentals. Orascom Construction Industries, another market mainstay, rose 0.5 percent to 385 pounds a share. Textile shares, on the other hand, soared. Shares in Arab Polvara raced 20.6 percent to 10.15 pounds and Nile Cotton Ginning jumped 22.6 percent to 39.99 pounds. Arabia Cotton Ginning rose 8.8 percent to 10.40 pounds a share. "There is a big question mark on why textile shares have risen," said Mohamed Fouad, managing director of Global Securities. "It could be a technical factor because it was close to a trend line so it should go up on technical terms," he said. Mohamed Radwan of Pharos Securities said textile shares had been lagging behind other sectors in the market.
