 LONDON, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Concerns about the US economy and banking sector woes gnawed at investor confidence on Wednesday despite a better-than-expected German business sentiment report, keeping stocks and the dollar under pressure. But a weakening greenback helped fuel interest in a range of commodities including oil, gold and industrial metals that had sold off recently. A Deutsche Bank warning that credit market aftershocks could hit its 2008 profits and data on Tuesday showing U.S. consumer confidence dropping to a five-year low in March conspired to keep investors cautious. Adding to the gloom, fresh US data on Wednesday showed new orders for long-lasting US manufactured goods unexpectedly fell 1.7 percent in February, reinforcing worries about the world's biggest economy. Wall Street looked set to open lower with major stock index futures all trading in the red. "There definitely is still nervousness in the banking sector and the announcement from Deutsche bank served as a reminder that JPMorgan raising its bid for Bear Stearns doesn't necessarily solve all the problems for the financial sector," said Sean Maloney, fixed-income strategist at Nomura in London. News early this week that JPMorgan had boosted its takeover offer for Bear Stearns by about fivefold had sparked a rally in financial stocks globally and eased worries about a sector constrained by a credit crunch. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares slid 0.9 percent, while Germany's DAX fell 0.7 percent with Deutsche Bank about 2 percent lower. London's FTSE 100 index shed 0.7 percent, weighed by a near 7 percent fall for Swiss miner Xtrata after takeover talks with the world's largest iron ore miner Vale broke down. Earlier in Asia, Japan's Nikkei ended down 0.3 percent, but MSCI's measure of other Asian stock markets climbed 0.7 percent. MSCI's main world equity index nudged 0.2 percent higher. DOLLAR DOWN, COMMODITIES UP The dollar slipped against a basket of major currencies, with the dollar index falling 0.8 percent amid ongoing concerns about the health of the US economy. In contrast, upbeat data showing the German business climate index, based on a poll of around 7,000 firms, rose to a better-than-expected 104.8 from 104.1 in February helped drive the euro higher. The euro rose about 0.7 percent on the day to $1.5736, further boosted by comments from European Central Bank Jean-Claude Trichet, which markets interpreted as suggesting no interest rate cuts were imminent. Testifying before an economic committee of the European Parliament, Trichet said the ECB believed the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving price stability in the medium term. Among commodities, US light crude for May delivery climbed $1.25 to $102.47, while gold rose to $947.70 an ounce from around $934.60 an ounce late in New York on Tuesday. Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal Exchange last traded at $8,155/tonne, up 0.8 percent. Global demand for many commodities is seen remaining intact thanks to booming economies such as China despite a gloomy US outlook. "The dollar's fall has prompted buying but traders are reluctant to take large positions ahead of the end of the quarter," said Shuji Sugata, a manager at Mitsubishi Corp Futures and Securities Ltd in Tokyo. Underlying concerns about the US economy underpinned demand for safe-haven U.S. Treasuries with the benchmark 10-year yield slipping about 5 basis points to 3.457 percent. But German 10-year bonds underperformed their US counterparts, weighed by Trichet's comments as well as fresh bond supply. The 10-year yield was little changed at 3.887 percent.
