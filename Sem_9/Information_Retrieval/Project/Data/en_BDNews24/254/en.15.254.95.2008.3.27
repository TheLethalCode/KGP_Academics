 Adrian Croft and Paul Majendie LONDON, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy pledged in a speech to Britain's parliament on Wednesday to send more troops to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan and called for a "new Franco-British brotherhood". The United States and Britain have repeatedly called on NATO allies to boost their contributions to the force in Afghanistan, where their troops are battling a Taliban that seems to be growing in strength. In London on a two-day state visit aimed at improving awkward ties, Sarkozy and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown both vowed to boost cooperation on the international economy and immigration. In a passionate speech to parliament, Sarkozy sketched a vision of far-reaching economic and defense cooperation and said France would send more troops to fight the Taliban if NATO backed its proposals. Paris has not yet made public its plans or gone into detail about troop numbers. "If these proposals are accepted, France will propose at the (forthcoming NATO) summit in Bucharest, reinforcing its military presence. We cannot accept the return of the Taliban and al Qaeda to Kabul," he told parliament to applause. Foreign Secretary David Miliband told Reuters after the speech: "I think there's a very clear signal that France wants to fulfill all of its responsibilities, diplomatic and military, in Afghanistan and that's obviously extremely welcome." Sarkozy said he would ask Brown's help in getting Washington to halt a plunge of the dollar making European exports more expensive. Britain has typically rejected the idea of managing foreign exchange levels, saying markets are the best guide. Brown, who will hold talks with Sarkozy on Thursday, said a new era was dawning for the "entente cordiale" -- a treaty signed by the two countries in 1904 -- in which Britain and France would speak as one on international economic reform. "I believe in the international institutions ... we will now vote together on crucial areas where we've got to reform the international economy," he told parliament. The neighbors, though bound together by mainstream European institutions like the European Union and NATO, have a love-hate relationship and mutual suspicion goes back centuries. But in an increasingly global world their economies now overlap in every sphere. "BROTHERHOOD" "I have come to propose to the British people that together we write a new page in our common history, that of a new Franco-British brotherhood," Sarkozy told parliament, where he received a standing ovation. The French president, accompanied by his new wife, former model Carla Bruni, was welcomed by Queen Elizabeth with a state carriage procession to Windsor Castle near London, where the couple will spend Wednesday night. Several British newspapers marked the visit by printing an old picture of Bruni posing nude. It is the first state visit by a French president since Jacques Chirac came in 1996. Brown and Sarkozy have struck up a good relationship since both came to power last year. But the British leader's popularity has waned and Sarkozy's standing has sunk since he married Bruni last month. Sarkozy has tried to improve relations with the United States and Britain, strained by the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, which Chirac resisted. Some political analysts say Sarkozy is reaching out to Britain because he does not get on well with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Berlin and Paris traditionally dominate the European Union. British officials say Brown and Sarkozy, due to hold talks on Thursday at the Arsenal soccer club stadium, will urge banks to disclose fully write-offs caused by the global credit crisis. Brown said he hoped the two countries would agree to tighten controls on illegal immigration at the French port of Calais.
