 RIO DE JANEIRO, March 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hapless Arsenal conceded six goals for the second time in Libertadores Cup Group Eight, losing 6-1 to Ecuadorean champions LDU. LDU became the first team to reach the last 16 after their big win in Quito on Wednesday against the Argentines who have suffered a dramatic slump since winning the Copa Sudamericana, the region's equivalent of the UEFA Cup, in December. Arsenal, beaten 6-0 at Brazil's Fluminense three weeks ago, made a promising start when Luciano Leguizamon volleyed home from 30 metres after four minutes. Midfielder Patricio Urrutia headed LDU level in the 14th and Damian Manso scored from a free kick before two goals from Luis Bolanos made it 4-1 at halftime. Claudio Bieler and 35-year-old former Ecuador midfielder Alfonso Obregon completed the scoring in the second half as LDU, who have 10 points from four games, guaranteed a top-two finish. Fluminense have seven points and a game in hand while Arsenal are third on three points. Diego Simeone's River Plate went top of Group Five with a 2-0 win over Universidad Catolica in Buenos Aires. Colombian Radamel Falcao Garcia scrambled the ball home in the first minute and Uruguay forward Sebastian Abreu snapped up a rebound in the 72nd. The Chileans had substitute Nicolas Nunez sent off in the 69th minute, three minutes after coming on, for a late tackle on Diego Buonanotte. Peruvian champions Deportivo San Martin beat troubled Mexicans America 1-0 in another Group Five match in Lima, Mario Leguizamon netting in the 36th minute. River lead with nine points from four games while San Martin and America have six apiece and Catolica three. Despite being the country's richest club, America have managed only four wins in 14 competitive games this year and are bottom of their group in the Mexican championshi
