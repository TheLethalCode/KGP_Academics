<TEXT>
 Kiev, March 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Poland supports Ukraine's bid for NATO membership and believes the former Soviet republic will join the alliance one day, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Friday. "We don't know if this is enough for today, but your actions and our support should all bring results," Tusk told a news conference three days before U.S. President George W. Bush visits Ukraine ahead of a NATO summit. "If not today, then tomorrow. If not tomorrow, then the day after. The issue is not easy, we know that. But if it comes to Poland, we are determined to support your aspirations."
