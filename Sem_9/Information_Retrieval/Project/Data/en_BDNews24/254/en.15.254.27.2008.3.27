 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com Telecoms Correspondent Dhaka, March 27 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission has sought primary proposals for the installation and operations of a submarine cable in the private sector, BTRC chairman Manzurul Alam said Thursday. Advertisements inviting the proposals as part of a tender procedure will be published in newspapers on Friday and Saturday, the telecoms regulator told bdnews24.com. The proposals will contain suggestions from private companies on the infrastructure of submarine cable connectivity and operating procedures. The BTRC has set May 15 as the deadline for proposal submissions. "After reviewing the proposals, the BTRC will decide whether one or more than one cable will be installed," Alam said. Bangladesh is currently connected with the submarine cable SE-ME-WE-4, used by 16 telecoms companies in 14 countries. A senior BTRC official told bdnews24.com that the move to install submarine cables in the private sector came to create an alternative to the monopoly of the BTTB. "Internet connectivity is at risk as it relies on the one and only cable (of BTTB). Also, in Bangladesh bandwidth rents are higher than in neighboring countries. We hope private companies would provide bandwidth at competitive prices," the official said. bdnews2
