<TITLE> Dhaka condemns Dutch politician's 'anti-Islamic' film </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 28 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Friday "condemned in the strongest terms" the posting of an "anti-Islamic" film, made by a Dutch rightwing politician, on a website. In an official statement, Dhaka termed the posting of the film "totally unwarranted and mindless" and warned that it could result in "grave consequences". The posting of the film on the website by the Dutch politician critical of the Quran will offend millions of Muslims around the world, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in the statement. "No right thinking person can endorse this. The Dutch government has distanced itself from this aberrant act," the statement said. "Islam is a faith of peace, which preaches patience and understanding, and the message of the Holy Quran has been the source of hope and inspiration for humanity through centuries." "The posting of this film on the web does not alter that abiding truth in any way." Dutch broadcasters refused to show the 15-minute film Fitna (strife), posted by Geert Wilders on his party's website. The Dutch government has expressed concerns that the film "could offend Muslims". Euronews, a France-based news website, reported that thousands demonstrated in the capital, Amsterdam, to oppose Wilders' comments, which they say do not reflect Dutch opinions. The United States, according to Euronews, feared the movie could trigger violent protests similar to those in 2006 after caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad were published in a Danish newspaper. bdnews
