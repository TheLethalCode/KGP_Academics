<TITLE> Bank of England stresses downside risks for pound </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The pound may have further to fall as Britain's economy adjusts from an unhealthy reliance on consumer spending towards exports, Bank of England policymakers signalled on Wednesday. The unusually blunt comments suggest Britain's central bank is not unhappy with recent currency market gyrations, which have seen the euro and the yen gain sharply at the expense of the pound and the dollar. Last week, the pound hit its lowest on a trade-weighted index in more than a decade as risk-averse investors switched out currencies of countries with large current account deficits and into those with surpluses. Bank Chief Economist Charles Bean said the risks to the currency, which has already shed around 10 percent in trade-weighted terms over the past year, remained to the downside. "I would certainly say that the risks are balanced to the downside," Bean told a parliamentary committee. "The financial markets are certainly pointing if anything to the risks being to the downside. Given the size of the current account deficit, I would share that view." Britain's current account deficit notched a record 20 billion pounds in the third-quarter of last year, equivalent to 5.7 percent of gross domestic product. The euro's surge to a record high against the dollar and the pound has fuelled speculation the European Central Bank may intervene in currency markets. The Bank of Japan has also voiced concern at the speed of the yen's recent ascent. Bank Governor Mervyn King said he was "not indifferent" to the exchange rate, but sounded relaxed about the speed of its decline, suggesting it was little more than a retracement of an unexplained rise two years ago. "Much of what has happened has been an unwinding of an appreciation that in 2006 we found very hard to understand," he said. He added that the publication of large trade deficits towards the end of last year had accentuated the need for a rebalancing of the economy towards exports and business investment. Sterling fell after the comments which traders interpreted to mean the central bank would not stand in the way of a further decline in the currency. "These are fairly candid comments coming from a central bank," said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec. "King has made clear that he would like to see a rebalancing of the economy and a weaker sterling is one way to facilitate that."
