 MOSCOW, March 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia's Prosecutor General's office on Thursday summoned former premier Mikhail Kasyanov, now an outspoken Kremlin critic, for questioning over a long-running corruption investigation, an aide said. Russian prosecutors have for several years been investigating allegations that Kasyanov illegally privatised a state-owned villa in a prestigious Moscow suburb. He has denied any wrongdoing and said the case was politically motivated. "He has been told to appear on March 31," Kasyanov's adviser Yelena Dikun told Reuters by telephone. "The assumption among his entourage is that this is to do with (the villa case)." Kasyanov has said in the past the villa case is part of a smear campaign staged by the authorities after he announced he was joining the opposition and would run for president. In January this year Kasyanov was barred from running in the March presidential election, after the central election commission alleged some of the signatures he submitted to support his bid had been forged. Russia's liberal opposition has lost representation in parliament and scores only a few percentage points in opinion polls.
