 BEIJING, March 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United Nations human rights council should address the crisis in Tibet, a rights group urged, as Beijing continued its propaganda blitz in the wake of more than two weeks of Tibetan protests in western China. The Tibetan uprising and China's response are at the centre of an international storm ahead of the Olympics in August. US President George W Bush encouraged Chinese President Hu Jintao on Wednesday to talk with the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader. Hu said the monk must renounce support for independence of Tibet and Taiwan and stop encouraging violence and illegal activities aimed at harming the Olympics. Human Rights Watch said Australia, the European Union, Switzerland and the United States raised human rights abuses in Tibet during a session of the UN Human Rights Council, but China blocked debate, backed by Algeria, Cuba, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. "The council has not only the right, but the obligation to address the Tibet crisis," a statement quoted Juliette de Rivero, Geneva advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, as saying. "It's scandalous that the council ends up silencing those who are trying to make sure it does its job." The unrest began with peaceful marches by Buddhist monks in Lhasa more than two weeks ago. Within days, riots erupted in which non-Tibetan Chinese migrants were attacked and their property burned until security forces filled the streets. China's official Xinhua News Agency quoted "living Buddhas" condemning other monks, called lamas in Tibet, who participated in the March 14 upheaval. "According to Buddhist karma, they cannot reincarnate after death because of the sin they have committed," said Chubakang Tubdain Kaizhub, head of the Tibetan chapter of the Buddhist Association of China. Protests have spread to parts of Chinese provinces that border Tibet and have large ethnic Tibetan populations. China says 19 people were killed, at the hands of Tibetan mobs. The Tibetan government-in-exile says 140 died in Lhasa and elsewhere -- most of them Tibetan victims of security forces. A small group of foreign and Chinese reporters arrived in Lhasa on Wednesday, tightly supervised by Chinese authorities. The Dalai Lama expressed surprise and said the visit would be good if reporters were given complete freedom. "Only then you can assess the real situation," he told reporters in New Delhi
