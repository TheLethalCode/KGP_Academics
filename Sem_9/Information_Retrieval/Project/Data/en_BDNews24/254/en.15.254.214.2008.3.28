<TITLE> Leading Hong Kong democrat calls it quits </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Hong Kong, March 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - One of Hong Kong's leading democrats, Martin Lee, who has led the territory's long push for full democracy under Chinese rule, has decided to quit legislative office, citing his age and a desire to make way for new leaders. "I'll be 70 in June and obviously there's the desire to give new blood a chance," Lee told Reuters on Friday. Lee, who first joined the legislature in 1985, said he would step down as a lawmaker at the end of his current term in July but would remain a member of the Democratic Party. "I always say that no one is indispensable, so it's time after 23 years now," said Lee, a senior barrister known for his gravelly voice and barbed grilling of public officials in Hong Kong's historic domed legislative council chamber. A founding member of the Democratic Party, Lee helped develop the local political landscape by establishing the first real opposition party in the territory. Since Hong Kong switched from British to Chinese rule in 1997, Lee and the pro-democracy camp have been a thorn in Beijing's side, demanding its communist rulers allow direct elections in Hong Kong in line with promises in the city's mini-constitution. In December, China's parliament made a landmark ruling to possibly allow direct elections for its leader in 2017, though key details will need to be hammered out in the coming few years. Lee dismissed suggestions his departure would further weaken the fractious pan-democracy camp at a critical time. "This is a continuous fight, it's going to be a long fight. The democrats just have to work together and if you work together, whether I'm there or not will not make that much difference. "Of course I'm not dropping out, there's still life in me and I'll still fight for democracy. I just won't be inside the legislative council," Lee added.
