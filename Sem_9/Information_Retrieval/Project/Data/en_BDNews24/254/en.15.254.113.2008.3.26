<TITLE> London readies for "Boris or Ken" mayoral showdown </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - In a little over a month, a former stalwart of the British left who famously breeds newts will take on a brash, Oxford-educated former journalist in the race to be elected mayor of London. It is showdown between two vastly different characters with equally eccentric personalities but the stakes could hardly be higher -- the responsibility of managing an 11 billion pound ($22 bln) budget and leading one of the world's most dynamic cities in playing host to the Olympic Games in 2012. Ken Livingstone, the incumbent, and his conservative challenger Boris Johnson, could define the phrase 'as different as chalk and cheese'. When it comes to the May 1 vote, they are likely to split the five-million-strong electorate too. While the personalities are key, the issues on the agenda are no less important for a city that wants to solidify its position as a major financial capital and lead the way on the environment and urban planning in the 21st century. From battling crime to improving a much-maligned public transport system, drafting new environment laws and keeping the city's dynamic economy on track in turbulent times, the issues are weighty and affect all the capital's 8 million residents. And at a time when polls are tight between the Labour government and the Conservative opposition, whoever wins the race to run the capital, the most powerful directly elected position in the country, could influence national politics too. "It would be a mistake to caricature it as two silly, slightly unhinged eccentrics bidding to run a major capital city," said Dermot Finch, the director of the Centre for Cities, an urban policy and planning group based in London. "This a big city, with a large budget in the mayor's hands, so the role has a very real, direct impact on people's lives," he said. "In terms of directly elected positions, it carries the most powerful mandate in Britain." "RED KEN AND MR CHAOTIC" In a city like New York, where sober suits, lots of money and a carefully constructed image are pre-requisites for any aspiring mayor, neither Boris nor Ken -- as they are universally referred to -- would likely stand a chance. But London, which only created the position of an elected mayor in 2000, is perhaps more idiosyncratic than New York, and the candidates bidding to run the city reflect that -- behind the frontrunners the top candidates include an openly gay former police chief and a 33-year-old member of the Green Party. While Livingstone, 62, a born-and-bred Londoner who was dubbed "Red Ken" for his left-wing views in the 1980s, has held the mayor's office since 2000, with 35 days to go, he is lagging several points behind Johnson in the polls. Johnson, 43, is the Conservative member of parliament for Henley, a wealthy town outside London, and a former journalist educated at the exclusive private school Eton and then Oxford. His mop of blond hair and brash opinionising has earned him an almost comic strip reputation, but he is popular in London's wealthier western outskirts and some of its posh inner districts where his erudition and self-deprecating wit play well. Part of his attraction, according to pollsters, is his natural 'anti-Kenness'. In terms of education and class he is everything Livingstone is not, and after years of Ken, who also ran London under a different hat in the 1980s, many want change. At the same time Johnson has almost no experience at handling the weighty administrative pressures of an office like mayor, and has been dubbed "Mr Chaotic" by some. In his years in office, and more than three decades in London politics, Livingstone has built a reputation as a 'can-do' manager with ready ideas and a gritty determination. As well as being known as a bon vivant who writes occasional restaurant columns, Livingstone is noted as a collector and breeder of newts. Some of his initiatives, such as signing a deal with Venezuela's Hugo Chavez last year for discounted oil have drawn accusations of consorting with left-wing dictators. Livingstone says it will ultimately make bus fares cheaper.
