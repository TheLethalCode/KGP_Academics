 Dhaka, March 29 (bdnews24.com)  Jahanara Alam struck a hat-trick as the Bangladesh women's cricket team whitewashed the Hong Kong women's team in the four-match series, inflicting a massive 115-run defeat to the visitors at Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium Saturday. Bangladesh, who had confirmed the series with a match to go, bundled out the visitors for 96 in 40.3 overs after posting a competitive 211 for nine in 50 overs. Chasing the total, Hong Kong lost opener Kaori Ida (0) in the second over before player of the match Connie Wong and skipper Nesha Pratt produced some resistance to take the side to 55 for two. Tithly Rani broke the 51-run partnership bowling Connie (14) out, and Nesha along with Betty Chan added 28 runs for the third wicket before Chan was run out for six, leaving the side at 83 for three in 26.4 overs. Afterwards, Romana Ahmed struck two quick blows to send Mariko Hill (0) and Godiva Li (0) back to the dressing room and Hong Kong slipped to 91 for five in 34 overs. Sathira Zakir removed Sarah Hepworth (0) to reduce them to 96 for six in 38.3 overs, and Hong Kong ended up their innings at 96 all out without putting on a single run on the board as Jahanara struck a hat-trick. Nesha topscored with 61 off 105 balls that was studded with five fours. Earlier, Bangladesh went beyond 200-mark riding on a fifty from Salma Khatun after deciding to bat first. Salma played a 96-ball 63 smashing five fours while Panna Ghosh (40), opener Sathira (20) and Chamely Khatun (23) were other remarkable scorers. Panna and Salma together put on 60 runs for the third wicket. Connie led the attack with three for 47 followed by Betty Chan on two for 35.
