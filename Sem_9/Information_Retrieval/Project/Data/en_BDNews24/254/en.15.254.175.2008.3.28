 Singapore, March 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks mostly dipped on Friday, dragged down by financials, and the dollar eased on worries that the widening credit crisis would claim more victims on Wall Street. Inflation fears were high on the agenda after oil traded around $107 a barrel, slightly off New York prices, but still 5 dollars shy of a record. Market speculation that Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc could suffer a fate similar to the near collapse of Bear Stearns pushed Lehman's shares down almost 9 percent in New York on Thursday. Lehman called the rumours "totally unfounded." "Overnight we had the mark downs in the investment banks in the U.S. and that has translated across here this morning," said Jamie Spiteri, manager of institutional sales at Shaw Stockbroking. Nagging worries about the health of the global financial system, rising inflation, and a murky outlook for corporate profits dented some stock indexes in the region. Tokyo's Nikkei dipped 0.1 percent by the midsession. Shanghai's benchmark fell 0.3 percent, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index fell 1.3 percent, with Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd down 4 percent. The bank is a secured lender to local margin lender Opes Prime Group, which was earlier placed under receivership. MSCI's index of Asian stocks outside of Japan was flat at 0214 GMT. New Zealand shares were a bright spot, with the NZX-50 index up 0.4 percent after economic growth beat expectations. Seoul's KOSPI also notched up a 0.8 percent gain and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index opened 0.4 percent higher. EARNINGS CLOUDY The outlook for U.S. earnings was also soured by a government report that showed corporate profits fell a steep 3.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007, and that U.S. economic growth nearly slowed to a halt in the same period. On Wall Street on Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average shed 1 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index lost 1.9 percent. U.S. stock index futures pointed to a tentative recovery later. The dollar was on the back foot on worries about the health of the world's top economy. The U.S. currency fell to 99.48 yen staying in sight of a 13-year low of 95.77 yen. The yen showed little reaction to news that Japan's core consumer inflation in February rose more than expected and scored the biggest increase in a decade. The euro edged up to $1.5791 from around $1.5766 in late U.S. trade on Thursday, turning back towards a record high of $1.5905 after making a pause from sharp gains earlier this week. U.S. crude was trading at $106.82 a barrel, easing from overnight levels but still within sight of a record after a bomb attack on Thursday on a major Iraqi crude pipeline slashed exports for the first time in years. Gold fell to $946.10/946.90 an ounce from $951.80/952.60 an ounce late in New York.
