 Chittagong, March 27 (bdnews24.com) - A Chittagong court Thursday sentenced four Islami Chhatra Shibir activists to death and three others to life imprisonment in a case involving the killing of eight activists of Bangladesh Chhatra League. Chittagong second additional and sessions judge Enamul Huq Chowdhury handed down the death penalty to Sajjad Hossain Khan chiefly known as Sajjad, Alamgir Kabir known as Baitta Alamgir, Md Azam and Solaiman. Baitta Alamgir and Md Azam are currently behind bars. They have also been convicted of murdering Gopal Krishna Muhuri of Chittagong Najirhat College. The judge pronounced that Enamul Huq, Abdul Quiyum Chowdhury popularly known as Imon and Habib Khan would have to serve out in jail for life. All of them have remained fugitive. The court also fined the convicts Tk 50,000 each and said they have to serve out another year in jail if they fail to pay the amount. The court acquitted another 13 accused of charges while two, killed in crossfire earlier, were exempted. The acquitted are ATM Mizbahul Kabir, Saiful Islam, Azizur Rahman, Mia Md Toufique, Nesar Ahmad, Mohammad Illias known as Haji Illias, Abdul Hakim nicknamed Saiful, Abdul Hamid known as Hamid, Bazal Ahmad, Bayezidur Rahman, Selim known as BDR Selim, Rezaur Rahman nicknamed Mukti, and Iqbal Hossain known as Iqbal. Accused Toufique and Iqbal, who were on bail, and detained Haji Illias were in the court during the announcement of the verdict. The court in the verdict said most of the accused belonged to Islami Chhatra Shibir. Shibir is the student wing of the Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh. Eight Chhatra League activists were gunned down at Bahaddarhat area in Chittagong on July 12, 2000 in broad daylight. A case was filed against 22 people with Chandgaon Police Station soon after the incident. Investigator Abdul Quader Khan, an official with the Criminal Investigation Department, submitted chargesheet in the case on Jan 17, 2001. After the verdict pronounced, public prosecutor Ahsanul Haque Hena told reporters he was happy with the verdict. "The accused got what they deserved," he said. Hena told bdnews24.com that although the murder had taken place during the Awami League rule, the incident had not been investigated properly. The investigation was later politically intimidated during the BNP-Jamaat coalition rule in 2001-2006. He praised the caretaker government and said the changed context helped to finish the trial. bdnew
