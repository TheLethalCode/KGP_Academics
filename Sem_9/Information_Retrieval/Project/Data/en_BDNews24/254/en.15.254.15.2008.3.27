<TITLE> BFF amends its constitution to embrace DFAs </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 27 (bdnews24.ocm) - The Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) Thursday finally approved the statutes of the District and Divisional Football Associations (DFA) through an extra-ordinary general meeting, clearing the way for holding the BFF's scheduled election on April 28. The BFF constitution earlier could not permit its election through the participation of delegates of the newly formed DFA in line with AFC/FIFA guidelines as the constitution only permits the delegates of the District Sports Association (DSA). With the amendment, the DFA will replace DSA in the BFF constitution that means there will be no legal bar to holding the BFF poll. The meeting also took away the voting right of four services teams -- Bangladesh Army, Bangladesh Navy, Bangladesh Air Force and Bangladesh Police, National Sports Council and the champions and runners-up of the latest league table of Dhaka Pioneer Football League. But, it kept the voting right alive for the universities and the Secondary Education Boards if they are active in football. The meeting also approved that the BFF secretariat, comprising a general secretary, a deputy general secretary, two joint secretaries and a treasurer, will be paid from the upcoming term and the executive committee would determine the honorarium for them. That means there will be no election to above mentioned five posts, but the EC would still remain a 21-member body with increasing five more members from the present 10. However, the approvals raised questions among the delegates, especially about way things had been amended. "The EGM was a designed meeting and we were not given the chance to discuss these matters that might harm football rather than help it," said former BFF joint secretary Badal Roy. "How could a councilor give his opinion when the AFC observer said that there was no alternative but to approve the amendments to avoid suspension," said former star Sheikh Mohammad Aslam. "Why would a government councilor join the AGM or EGM if he had no voting right," Aslam, a councilor of National Sports Council, added. The BFF president denying the allegations said, "It was not right that the delegates could not speak at the meeting." "Actually, we have nothing to do when the AFC/FIFA guidelines come to us and we are forced to implement them," Sultan said, "The AFC/FIFA has been working for a universal statute for all 208 footballing nations and we can't go beyond their advice." Replying to a query, the BFF boss said, "The services teams and NSC are government bodies and there might be influence in the poll, so these bodies have been given the right of sending delegates, but their voting rights have been cut in line with the AFC/FIFA guidelines." Of 131 councilors, 115 members attended the meeting while AFC general secretary Dato Paul Moni and AFC legal adviser member Perarra were present as observers. "How would those DFAs, already formed, get validity, as the meeting approved DFA only on Thursday," was the question posed by a councilor named Fazlur Rahman Babul.
