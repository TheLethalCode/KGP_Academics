 MOSCOW, March 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian president-elect Dmitry Medvedev has predicted some people might try to challenge his presidency, the first acknowledgement of what could be a simmering turf war among Kremlin clans. Kremlin-watchers say factions close to outgoing president Vladimir Putin are nervous about Medvedev running Russia and want to leave the way open for Putin to return if his replacement does not prove up to the job.

Coming from academia and business, Medvedev is regarded by the "siloviki" as an outsider. They had hoped Putin would find a way to stay on in office, or endorse one of their own number as his replacement. In the interview, Medvedev said he had no objection to former security service officers holding top government posts. "They are people, just like everyone else.
