 CHENNAI, India, March 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian batsman Rahul Dravid said on Saturday it had been beyond his dreams to achieve 10,000 test runs. The 35-year-old Dravid became only the sixth player to reach the landmark while scoring 111 for his 25th century on day four of the first test against South Africa. Dravid also became only the third player to achieve the landmark in both tests and one-dayers, joining compatriot Sachin Tendulkar and West Indies batsman Brian Lara. "It is a proud moment," he told reporters. "For me, growing up, I dreamt of playing for India. When I look back I probably exceeded my expectations with what I have done over the last 10 to 12 years. "I can look back and reflect that I maximised my potential over these years," he said. "To do it in Chennai with my family and friends watching was great." GAVASKAR FEAT Dravid said he remembered as a boy when Sunil Gavaskar became the first to reach the mark, with a late cut against Pakistan in the Ahmedabad test in 1987. "I never had an ambition to do it because I never believed," he said. "It is just a reflection of my longevity in the game." Australians Allan Border and Steve Waugh are the other two players to score 10,000 test runs. "For me to be in that company is surreal in some ways," Dravid said. "I know Ricky Ponting and Jacques Kallis, the other two great batsmen of my generation, are also probably going to get there very soon." He was disappointed that opener Virender Sehwag could not break Lara's world record for the highest score (400 not out) after he was dismissed for an Indian-record 319 on Saturday. "We knew if Viru batted for a couple of hours he would get close to it, if not pass it," he said. "He has always batted positively that is why he has been able to score that way.
