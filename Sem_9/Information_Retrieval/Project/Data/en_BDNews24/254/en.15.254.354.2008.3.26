<TITLE> Shell, Virent work on green gasoline alternative </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil company Royal Dutch Shell Plc said on Wednesday it was working with US biosciences firm Virent Energy Systems to produce a gasoline alternative from non-food crops that would reduce CO2 emissions without driving up food prices. Shell said in a statement that unlike ethanol, currently the main biofuel alternative to gasoline, the fuel it and Virent aim to develop will be able to run in existing vehicles without the need to modify their engines. Today's gasoline engines can usually only run on a small amounts of ethanol blended with gasoline -- typically 5 percent. Much higher percentages can be used with modification. Shell gave no targets for achieving commercial production of the new fuel. Last May, Shell and Madison, Wisconsin-based Virent announced a partnership to develop processes to manufacture hydrogen from biomass, using the same technology which the partners hope will now produce "biogasoline". A Shell spokesman said the collaboration on hydrogen was still active.
