 Dhaka, March 27 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh Women's Cricket Team Thursday clinched the four-match one-dayer series against the Hong Kong counterparts 3-0 with a match to go when they handed a 71-run defeat to the visitors. The hosts bundled Hong Kong out for 87 after scoring a modest 158 all out in 50 overs at Birshreshtha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium in Chittagong. Chasing the target, the visitors fell in trouble wobbling at 10 for two in the 10th over before opener Connie Wong (36) and skipper Neisha Pratt (24) steadied the innings contributing 44 runs for the third wicket. The dismissal of Neisha triggered a collapse in the middle and Hong Kong slipped to 79 for eight from 54 for three and they were finally stopped at 87. Chameli Khatun (2/3), Sathira Khatun (2/10) and Tithly Rani (2/18) played key roles in wrapping the opponents innings. Earlier, put in to bat first, Bangladesh were all out 158 in 50 overs as Beitty Chan claimed five wickets for 28.
