 BEIJING, March 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A 19-year-old woman has confessed her part in a failed "terrorist" attack on a Chinese domestic flight earlier this month, Xinhua news agency reported on Thursday, citing China's Public Security ministry. Chinese officials earlier this month said internationally backed separatists seeking an independent Xinjiang, the largely Muslim region in the country's northwest, were behind the failed March 7 attack. The plane cut short its journey from Xinjiang to Beijing and landed in the northwestern city of Lanzhou. Guzalinur Turdi, an ethnic Uighur, had boarded the plane with a "hidden explosive device" that she smuggled past airport security personnel, Xinhua quoted a statement from the ministry as saying. "She went ahead with her plan for sabotage but was thwarted. She fully confessed," it said. A senior Chinese official said recently that extremist Uighurs -- a Turkic people who linguistic and cultural bonds with central Asia -- were plotting attacks on the Beijing Olympics. A source with knowledge of the investigation earlier told Reuters a woman tried to light flammable liquid smuggled in a canned drink in the plane's toilet, but aroused the suspicion of crew and other passengers. The statement provided no further details of the investigation but reiterated that the incident was an "organised and premeditated terrorist attack targeting the aircraft". Xinjiang is home to 8 million Muslim Uighurs, many of whom resent the growing presence and economic grip of the Han ethnic majority. The oil-rich region borders Pakistan and Afghanistan. Exiled Uighurs campaigning for an independent country have said China concocted the plane incident to justify heavy controls on Uighurs. China has provided few details of its probe, but Xinhua quoted the region's Communist Party chief Wang Lequan as saying that another man on board the flight was detained with Turdi. A third suspect was detained a week later, and had confessed to masterminding the sabotage attempt, Xinhua said. China has stepped up security at airports, extending bans on international passengers carrying fluids on-board to domestic flights. Airports on Wednesday had started asking passengers to remove their shoes during security checks at airports, Xinhua said in a separate report. China's aviation regulator, the General Administration of Civil Aviation (CAAC), had also ordered international airlines to provide personal information on all passengers and staff on flights to China to border control stations before landing. From May 1, airlines would need to provide details of staff and passengers' "nationality, sex, birth date and passport numbers and passport expiry date", CAAC said in a notice posted on its Web si
