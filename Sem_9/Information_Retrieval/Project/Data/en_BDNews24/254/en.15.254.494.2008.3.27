 CHENNAI, India, March 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South African Hashim Amla was elated after scoring his first overseas century in the first test against India on Thursday. Amla's 159 led the visitors to 540 all out before India reached 82 without loss by the close of the second day. The number three batsman handled the home spinners and the heat for almost seven hours to register his fourth test century. "It was a good wicket to bat on but they were the hottest conditions I've ever batted on, that was the most difficult challenge," Amla told reporters. "It is always special to score a hundred in the sub-continent, it gives you a lot of confidence. It is a special moment because it came away from home." Amla was eventually run out after a mix-up with Mark Boucher (70). The 24-year-old centurion said the innings was second only to his career-best 176 not out against New Zealand in last year's home series when he scored hundreds in two successive tests.

Amla hit his maiden test hundred against New Zealand in 2006 in his fourth match and went 23 innings without another until he made his unbeaten 176. He said South Africa's bowlers had their work cut out against India's batting after opener Virender Sehwag lashed 52 not out from 61 deliveries. "We've to keep the pressure on and get the run rate down, tie down and frustrate the batsmen into trying to throw their wickets away," said Amla. Sehwag hoped the home batsmen could carve out a lead before allowing spinners Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh to take over on a wearing pitch. "We'll look to get a lead of around 50-100 runs and put pressure on them," he said. "Everyone knows the Chennai wicket spins and bounces so it will be difficult to bat against Harbhajan and Kumble
