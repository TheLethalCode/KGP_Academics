<TITLE> Zimbabweans vote, desperate to end economic misery </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 HARARE, March 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabweans queued to vote on Saturday in the most crucial election since independence in 1980, many of them desperate to end the misery of economic collapse under veteran President Robert Mugabe. But the opposition said Mugabe's ruling ZANU-PF party was planning to steal victory through multiple voting by its supporters. It said voting ink could be removed from ballots with detergent. Combined with a bloated voter role and the printing of 3 million extra ballot papers this "ensures that there will be multiple voting" said Tendai Biti a senior official in the MDC party of main challenger Morgan Tsvangirai. "There is absolutely no doubt we have won this election," he added. Zimbabwe, its once prosperous economy in ruins, is suffering the world's highest inflation rate at more than 100,000 percent, chronic shortages of food and fuel and a rampant HIV/AIDS epidemic that has contributed to a steep decline in life expectancy. Mugabe, who blames the collapse on Western sanctions, faces the biggest challenge of his 28-year rule from veteran rival Tsvangirai and ruling ZANU-PF party defector Simba Makoni. Many voters told Reuters they wanted a new government. "I am voting for change. I am praying for a free and fair election. It is the only way this country can move forward," said Richard Mutedzi, 25, a trained mechanic who voted in Chitungwiza, 30 km (20 miles) south of Harare. He said he was forced to sell odds and ends because of lack of work. Despite the odds stacked against Mugabe, 84, many analysts believe he will be declared the victor. Mugabe oozed his usual confidence when he voted in Harare on Saturday. "We will succeed. We will conquer," he said, denying that he planned to steal the vote. "Why should I cheat? The people are there supporting us. The moment the people stop supporting you, then that's the moment you should quit politics," he said. FEARS OF RIGGING The opposition fears many supporters will not have time to vote, saying polling stations have been distributed in favour of Mugabe's rural strongholds. Biti, secretary-general of Tsvangirai's MDC faction, said voting was slow and some election agents were prevented from entering polling stations. He said hundreds of voters were also turned away as unregistered. Despite the fraud allegations, Tsvangirai said he would win. "We are absolutely confident that the outcome will be in the favour of the people," he said as he voted in Harare. Some people slept at polling stations and queues formed before they opened just after 7.00 a.m. (0500 GMT). Voting was scheduled to last 12 hours, with results not expected for several days. Mother of three Gertrude Muzanenhamo, 36, voted early in the poor township of Warren Park, telling reporters: "People are dying in hospitals and funeral expenses are very high. How do you expect us to survive? Shop shelves are empty." Sagodolu Sikhosana a rural villager in the opposition stronghold of Matabeleland said after voting: "Things have been too hard for too long. I think now there needs to be a change and they need to take us more seriously." Analysts say Mugabe has maintained a tight grip on power through a combination of ruthless security crackdowns, intimidation of ruling party rivals and an elaborate patronage system. Voting was largely peaceful but police said a bomb exploded in the house of a ruling party candidate in Zimbabwe's second city of Bulawayo, an opposition stronghold. No-one was hurt. "I can't say Zimbabweans are cowards or that they are cautious. They are peace loving people but if Mugabe steals the election there will surely be trouble in this country," red-eyed Leo Kariwo said as he waited to vote in a Harare township. Mugabe's rivals believe they can finally end his iron rule because of the economic meltdown that has reduced even his traditional and favoured rural strongholds to misery. But the powerful security forces have thrown their backing behind Mugabe, stoking accusations that he will use his incumbent power to rig victory. Voters on Saturday said police and army units backed by armoured vehicles and water cannons had patrolled overnight. "That is intimidation but we will not be cowed," said Samuel Furutsa in the Harare township of Mufakose. Some security chiefs say they will not accept a Tsvangirai victory but he said they must be bound by the constitution. "I am not seeking the security chiefs mandate but the people's mandate," he told reporters as he voted. If no candidate wins more than 51 percent of the vote on Saturday, the election will go into a second round, when the two opposition parties would likely unite.
