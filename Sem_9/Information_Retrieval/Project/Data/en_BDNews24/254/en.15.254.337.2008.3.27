 MOSCOW, March 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian president-elect Dmitry Medvedev ordered anti-corruption steps to protect small businesses on Thursday, a first sign he is serious about fighting the endemic graft economists say is hampering growth. Arbitrary inspections by officials -- from firemen to the police -- are often an excuse to extort bribes from small firms and must halt, Medvedev told a State Council meeting in Tobolsk. "This proposal might leave some officials from the fire, sanitary services and police ... close to a heart attack, because this is what they make money on -- both officially and illegally," Medvedev told the Kremlin's advisory State Council. "The proposal sounds as following: controlling bodies should be barred from entering small enterprises," he added.

HOPES It was not immediately clear whether Medvedev's proposals would have any impact on corrupt officials, who have survived periodic campaigns of successive leaders, including Putin. Putin is credited at home with forging radical economic reforms at the start of his rule which helped achieve eight years of growth after a decade of post-Soviet decline. Medvedev has said his job is to ensure "decades of economic stability" for Russia. Most analysts expect his presidency to be marked by economic fine-tuning, rather than bold reforms. Rory MacFarquhar, Executive Director of Goldman Sachs, said Medvedev's announcement confirmed that "on the margin, relative to the current policy framework, (he) is somewhat more liberal. "But there is no sense that there's going to be some big push ... This is exactly the kind of incremental improvement that it is right to expec
