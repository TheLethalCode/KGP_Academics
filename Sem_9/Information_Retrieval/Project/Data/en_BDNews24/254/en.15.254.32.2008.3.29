<TITLE> Syria opens Arab summit, vows to help on Lebanon </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Damascus, March 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Syrian President Bashar al-Assad opened an Arab summit in Damascus on Saturday with a promise to help resolve the long political crisis in Lebanon, which boycotted the meeting in protest at Syrian policy. Eleven heads of state from the Arab League's 22 members were present at the opening, slightly less than normal for the two-day annual event, reflecting suspicions that through its allies in Lebanon Syria has obstructed the election of a new Lebanese president. Along with Lebanon, three key Arab U.S. allies -- King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and King Abdullah of Jordan -- stayed away from the summit, reducing the chances that the meeting will break new ground on Lebanon or other regional conflicts. Assad dismissed the accusation that his country was behind the deadlock in Lebanon, which has not had a president since November because the government and the Syrian-backed opposition cannot agree on the composition of a new cabinet. "We in Syria are fully prepared to cooperate with Arab or non-Arab efforts... on condition that they are based on Lebanese national consensus, the basis for stability in Lebanon," Assad said in his opening speech as summit host. "The key to a solution is in the hands of the Lebanese themselves. They have their homeland, their institutions and constitution and they have the necessary awareness," he added. He did not mention the absence of Lebanon or the low level of representation by the Arab governments allied to the Lebanese government and friendly with the United States. Syria has said the United States campaigned to dissuade Arab leaders from attending. The United States faults Syria for its policies in Lebanon and for supporting Palestinian guerrilla groups. The conflict over Lebanon reflects the wider struggle for regional influence between the United States and Syria's ally Iran. Resolutions prepared for the summit do not contain substantial new ideas on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or on the problems facing Arab League members Iraq or Sudan, analysts say.
