 BANJA LUKA, Bosnia, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A few hundred Bosnian Serb war invalids, many of them amputees in wheelchairs or on crutches, clashed with police on Wednesday during a protest to demand better benefits. Police in full riot gear tried to stop them from proceeding towards the main government building but the protesters forced their way through their cordon. One person was taken to a hospital with slight injuries, hospital officials said. Goran Kostic, leader of the regional association of war invalids, warned that he would begin a hunger strike unless Serb Republic Prime Minister Milorad Dodik received the protesters. The invalids want their payments increased by 50 percent and also seek better protection of their rights.
