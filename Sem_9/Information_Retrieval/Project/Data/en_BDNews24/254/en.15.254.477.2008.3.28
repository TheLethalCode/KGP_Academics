 Beijing, March 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Shanghai Communist Party chief Chen Liangyu pleaded "not guilty" at the opening of his trial this week on corruption charges linked to the misuse of the city's pension fund, state media reported on Friday. Chen, dismissed from office in 2006 amid investigations into the scandal, appeared at a court in China's northern port city of Tianjin on Tuesday and Wednesday charged with "taking bribes, abuse of office and dereliction of duty", local media reported. Chen had been accused of taking 2.4 million yuan ($342,000) in bribes, and had "backed the Shanghai Labour and Social Security Bureau's illegal loans of billions of yuan, causing great losses to state assets", the Beijing News said on Friday. At the closed hearing, Chen appeared healthy and admitted to being "partially responsible", but he "made no clear expression of guilt", the paper said, without elaborating. Chen, a former member of the Communist Party's elite Politburo, is the most senior official to be toppled for corruption since former Beijing Party boss Chen Xitong was sacked from office in 1995. Chen had been accused of enriching cronies through contract and land use approvals and of rubber-stamping promotions in exchange for kick-backs during his 20 years in office as Shanghai district chief, mayor and Party boss. The inquiry into the Shanghai pension fund scandal, which emerged in 2006 and involved the misappropriation of at least 33 billion yuan ($4.7 billion), has toppled dozens of the city's government officials and executives.
