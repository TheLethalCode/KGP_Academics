 Dhaka, March 28 (bdnews24.com) The government Friday asked people not to pay money to agents for going to Kurdistan as Bangladesh has no diplomatic relations with Iraq. Some recruiting agents have been sending people to the northern Iraqi state with offers of lucrative jobs, said expatriates' welfare secretary Abdul Matin Chowdhury. He said a taskforce was investigating the incidents of sending some Bangladeshis, now perishing in "unsafe" Kurdistan. "Some recruiting agencies are currently under watch. I urge people not to go to Kurdistan, because we don't have any mission in the war-torn Iraq," Chowdhury told bdnews24.com. The secretary made the appeal as the media reported that some 1,500 Bangladeshis who had travelled to Kurdistan without valid documents were facing a dire situation there. Forty-nine Bangladeshis have already been sent back by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) on March 19 from Kurdistan, according to its Dhaka office. "We have urged the IOM to bring back the remaining Bangladeshis languishing in Kurdistan," said Chowdhury. The local media in February reported that some 1,500 Bangladeshis were being forced to do "odd jobs" in Kurdistan bordering Turkey. The cheated people had been promised by the recruiting agents that their brokers would take them to Turkey, en route to Western Europe. Kurdistan's economy is much better than in other parts of Iraq. The state has become risky as the Turkish government forces in February carried out a massive operation in Kurdistan against the guerrillas of Kurdistan Workers' Party. bdnews
