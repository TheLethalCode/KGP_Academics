 Dhaka, March 29 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh have accepted an offer to host Group A matches in the Asian Football Confederation President's Cup in May, after Nepal withdrew from the tournament citing domestic political instability. "The AFC offered us Group A matches in the AFC President's Cup to be held in the last week of May, but we told them we would be ready to host the matches by the middle of May," "This would be following the national team's assignment in the SAFF Championship in the first week of June in Sri Lanka and the Maldives," said Bangladesh Football Federation acting general secretary Manzoor Hossain Malu Saturday. The decision was taken Friday at an executive committee meeting, added Malu. Bangladesh's Abahani Limited, Nepal Police Club, Regar-Tadaz of Tajkistan and Pakistan's WAPDA were drawn in the group. The group had been scheduled for April 20-24 in Nepal. bd
