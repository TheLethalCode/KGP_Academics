<TEXT>
 LONDON, March 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Central banks moved to provide extra liquidity to stressed markets on Thursday, helping lift already positive European shares, while the dollar recovered some strength after a recent battering. Asian shares were generally lower, hit by new signs that the US economy is flagging in the form of tumbling orders for US-made manufacturing goods along with worries about more bank write-downs after a slew of downgrades on US bank earnings. But sentiment was lifted in Europe as central banks stepped in. The European Central Bank promised publicly to add additional liquidity if needed as the quarter comes to an end and the Bank of England and Swiss National Bank operated in the markets to try to get interbank lending rates down. "It seems to be the same old story - there's a scramble for cash at the moment," said a trader in Dublin.

The euro was down 0.7 percent on the day at $1.5734, nearly two cents below last week's record highs above $1.59, but still up 7.8 percent this quarter "There was quite a strong rally in euro/dollar yesterday and it seems that the market got caught a bit short dollars, so now there is a slight recovery, and there is some extra funding demand for dollars into quarter end," said Geoffrey Yu, currency strategist at UBS in Zurich. The dollar was also up a quarter percent against a basket of six major currencies, but still down 6.5 percent for the quarter. Euro zone government bonds sold off slightly. The two-year Schatz yield was up 2 basis points at 3.447 percent while the 10-year Bund yield was at 3.905 percent, barely chang
