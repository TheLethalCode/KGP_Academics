 SINGAPORE, March 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks fell more than 1 percent on Thursday as financials slipped on worries over bank earnings, and the dollar hovered near a record low after a drop in US durable goods stoked concerns the world's top economy is already in a recession. Further signs the US economy is flagging, and worries that there will be more bank write-downs after a prominent analyst downgraded four major US banks, were compounded by inflation concerns as oil prices headed higher, and investors took refuge in bonds. Bank shares, such as Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ and Australia's Macquarie Group, were among the biggest fallers, following the bank downgrades, a profit warning from Deutsche Bank and comments from European central bankers that there was no end in sight to the global credit crunch. "It feels like a recession and it smells like a recession, so we may as well call it a recession," said Eric Betts, equities strategist at Nomura Australia. "We've had problems at individual banks before but this time it seems to be industry-wide. The big worries are the margin crunch and rise in corporate bad debts," he added. Tokyo's Nikkei fell 1.8 percent by the midsession, dragged lower by exporters such as Honda Motor Co Ltd as the stronger yen promised to erode their profits. MSCI's index of other Asian shares fell 1.2 percent by 0235 GMT, taking its losses so far this year to just under 15 percent. Seoul's KOSPI fell 0.9 percent, Sydney's S&P/ASX 200 index shed 0.6 percent, and Taipei's TAEIX dropped 1.9 percent in early trade. OIL AT $106 Oil traded above $106 dollars a barrel after a U.S. government report showed larger-than-expected drops in fuel stocks and declining fuel production in the world's top oil consumer. US crude oil futures added 29 cents to $106.21, while London Brent traded at $104.40. The dollar was within striking distance of a record low versus against the euro after the European Central Bank president's remark that euro zone rates were at the right level cooled expectations for a near-term ECB rate cut. US short-term interest rate futures now indicate investors see around a 40 percent chance of the Fed cutting interest rates by 50 basis points in April. A 25 basis-point rate cut is fully priced. Against the yen, the dollar traded at 98.75 yen The US currency hit a 13-year low of 95.77 yen on EBS early last week. The euro traded at $1.5803 against the dollar. Japanese government bond futures were lifted by the Nikkei's fall and strength in the yen. June 10-year JGB futures rose as high as 141.03, before trimming gains to 140.85 a rise of 0.41 of a point on the day. The 10-year JGB yield fell 1.5 basis points to 1.260 percent edging back towards a three-year low of 1.215 percent reached on Wednesday. Surging oil and a weaker dollar sent investors to gold. Spot prices rose to $952/952.80 an ounce
