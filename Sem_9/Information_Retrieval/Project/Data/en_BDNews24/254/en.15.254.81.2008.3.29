<TEXT>
 Barisal, March 29 (bdnews24.com)- The government will more than double subsidies to various sectors in the revised budget, though revenue collection will have to be raised to support such a measure, finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said Saturday. Subsidies will amount to 19 per cent of the revised budget from the original seven per cent, to counter the effect of rising commodity prices worldwide, Mirza Aziz said at a pre-budget discussion meeting at Barisal Circuit House Saturday. "It is not possible for the present caretaker government to bear the burden of increasing subsidies alone. We will also consider proposals for increasing the rate of tax collection along with national income," the finance adviser. The adviser mentioned that the rate of tax collection alongside the national income is low in Bangladesh. He said the per capita income in Nepal is less than than in Bangladesh but the people of that country pay more tax than Bangladeshis. On the demands of the people Mirza Aziz said it cannot be guaranteed that the government would be able to reflect people's demands in the next budget. "People have to realise the conflicting positions of subsidies, taxes and demands within the national economy," he said He urged participants of the meeting to make proposals on how to make adjustments between these three areas, and on how to increase the national income and rate of tax collection. Reviewing subsidies, the finance adviser said for the 2007-08 fiscal year the original allocation for subsidies was Tk 6,000 crore, or 7 percent, out of the total budget of Tk 80,000 crore. In the revised budget for fiscal 2007-08 the total amount of subsidy would stand at Tk 15,000 crore. Mirza Aziz said that the pre-budget discussions being held in each divisional headquarter would make the forthcoming budget more meaningful. "The present government is not an elected one. However, it does not mean that we are isolated from the people," the finance adviser said. National Board of Revenue chairman Abdul Majid, secretary of the planning ministry Zafar Ahmed Chowdhury and acting secretary of the finance ministry Md Tarek, Barisal divisional commissioner Md Harun Chowdhury and Barisal Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Ebaidul Haque Chan were among those present at Saturday's discussion.. bdnews2
