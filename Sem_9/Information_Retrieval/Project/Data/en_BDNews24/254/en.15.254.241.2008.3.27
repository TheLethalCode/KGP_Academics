 WASHINGTON, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President George W Bush announced on Wednesday he would visit Russia early next month for talks with President Vladimir Putin on strategic issues, including US plans for a missile defense shield in Eastern Europe. "I'm going to go to Russia," Bush told reporters at the White House, saying he had been invited to Sochi, where Putin has a holiday home. "President Putin has invited me to go to Sochi to discuss the strategic agreement, a crucial part of which is missile defense." "We're optimistic we can reach an accord on some very important matters," he said. Bush said the visit would take place after the April 2-4 NATO summit in Romania, which Putin is scheduled to attend for a meeting of the NATO-Russia Council. Bush is currently scheduled to visit Croatia immediately after the summit, so the Russian trip could follow that, but the president's advisers said details were still being worked out. Russia welcomed Bush's decision to make the trip, probably his last opportunity to meet Putin in his home country before the Russian leader hands over power on May 7 to President-elect Dmitry Medvedev. Putin is expected to become prime minister in the new government. "We are satisfied that the U.S. president has accepted an invitation issued earlier by President Putin to visit Sochi and discuss a wide range of issues at a working summit," Putin's top foreign policy adviser Sergei Prikhodko told Reuters. Stephen Hadley, Bush's national security adviser, said the meeting would follow up on a recent visit by Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who talked to the Russians about a possible strategic agreement. Hadley said the decision to meet was "an indication by the two leaders that there may be an opportunity here to provide a strategic framework for the relationship, identify areas of cooperation, resolve some outstanding issues so that the relationship is in good shape to be handed over to their respective successors." IN ACCORD ON IRAN Bush said Russia and the United States agreed on many strategic issues, including their belief that Iran should not acquire the capability to enrich uranium. The United States believes Iran's nuclear program is aimed at developing atomic weapons, but Tehran insists it is for peaceful purposes. "I supported Russian efforts to convince the Iranians that they didn't need to learn how to enrich because he, Putin, was willing to provide enriched uranium for a civilian nuclear power plant. Therefore, no need to enrich," Bush said. Bush said his plan to locate a missile defense shield in Poland and the Czech Republic would also be on the agenda. The United States has said the shield is aimed at protecting Europe and the United States from missiles fired by countries like Iran, but Moscow has expressed skepticism about the plan. "It doesn't take many missiles to overwhelm the kind of system we're talking about," Bush said, adding that Russia easily had enough weapons to do that. Hadley said the main issue on the missile shield was to convince Russia the installation was aimed at potential threats coming from the Middle East, and not at Russia. "We are trying to find a formula of measures which will give Russia some confidence on that," he said. The measures could include involving Russia, Europe and the United States in a regional system. Bush has prided himself on maintaining good ties with Putin, once famously saying he had been able to get a sense of his soul. Despite efforts to ensure good ties, Russian and US relations have been strained over issues including the missile defense shield and Kosovo's independence. "When you hear people say that George Bush has got good relations with Vladimir Putin, there's a reason why," Bush said. He said his strategy all along had been to maintain good personal relations with Putin "so that he'll listen to what I say." "It's important that we have good relations with Russia," Bush add
