<TEXT>
 Patuakhali, March 28 (bdnews24.com)The trials of "war criminals" have not been possible partly because of a discord among freedom fighters, said AK Khandker, convenor of the Sector Commanders' Forum, Friday. "The nation now stands united in calls for the trials of war criminals," Khandker said at freedom fighters' reunion in Patuakhali. The former Air Force chief called upon the government to initiate the trial of war criminals by constituting an international tribunal. "The trials didn't take place in the past 37 years because freedom fighters were not pushing the agenda together. It helped the war criminals take up important positions in this independent country," Khandker said. "The partners of the Pakistani occupation forces killed Bangalees, persecuted our mothers and sisters and burnt down houses and institutions. The nation is united today demanding their trials." The war crimes were not only against individuals, but against the state, Khandker said. "The offenders must be tried in an international tribunal which could be formed with the help of the United Nations and the onus is on the government," he said. Khandker urged all to portray the correct history of the Liberation War before the youth, the new generation. Presided over by Habibur Rahman, sub-sector commander of Patuakhali region during the 1971 war, the reunion was also addressed by retired lieutenant general Harun-Ar-Rashid and retired major general Masudur Rahman. Prizes were given away among the winners of a cultural programme organised by the Patuakhali wing of Muktijoddha Sangsad to mark Independence Day. bdnews24.com/
