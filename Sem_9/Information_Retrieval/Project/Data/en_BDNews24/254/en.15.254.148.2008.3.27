 Rangamati, March 27 (bdnews24.com)Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Thursday announced a government decision to introduce mobile connectivity to municipal areas of the three CHT districts. "Establishing mobile networks in the hill areas is a long-running demand by people. The government has decided to introduce mobile networks to the municipal areas of the three hills districts," Fakhruddin told a discussion meeting with government officials and local civil-society representatives, at the Tribal Cultural Institute in Rangamati. The CA also said: "The CHT peace agreement was signed in 1997 to uphold the educational, cultural, social and political rights in the hill areas like other areas of the country. The present government has taken different steps in continuation of the agreement." Mentioning the "vulnerable condition" of the telecoms system in the CHT area that also includes Bandarban and Khagrachhari, Fakhruddin said: "Steps will be taken to improve the quality of telephone services." The CA mentioned that Tk 1,200 crore had so far been allocated for development of the hill areas in the years after the signing of the peace agreement. "A further Tk 207 crore will be allocated in the next fiscal year," he said. In the meeting, the chief adviser referred to the introduction of judge's courts in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. Staffers will be appointed to set up judge's courts by April to make them operative by the time. Allowances for local headmen were inadequate compared to the roles they play in maintaining peace in the area, he said, adding: "Allowances will be increased for them." The chief adviser also pledged steps to rehabilitate the jumia families affected by the attack of rats and said: "Funds have already been allocated for that purpose." bdnews2
