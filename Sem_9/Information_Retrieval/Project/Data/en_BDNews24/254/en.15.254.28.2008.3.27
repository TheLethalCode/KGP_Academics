<TEXT>
 PARIS, March 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares were up 1 percent by midday on Thursday, reaching a two-week high as comments by the European Central Bank that it would pump extra liquidity as needed propelled banking shares higher. The central banks of Britain and Switzerland also promised extra funds to ease pressure on interbank lending rates. Swiss bank UBS -- hammered over the past few months by worries over the impact of the global credit crisis -- was among the biggest gainers, up 2.1 percent, while Barclays rose 2.2 percent and HBOS added 3.7 percent. Software maker SAP dropped 4.8 percent after US peer Oracle said its customers had become more cautious, dealing a blow to the idea that software companies would be immune to the turmoil rocking markets. By 1150 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 1 percent at 1,270.57 points, a level last seen on March 14. The index is still down 15 percent so far this year, on track to record its worst quarterly performance since the third quarter of 2002. "The favourable valuation and the already very negative sentiment may be providing the equity markets with support," Gerhard Schwarz, strategist at HVB/UniCredit in Munich, wrote in a note. "But as long as the fundamental environment for equities remains under pressure from the credit crisis and falling leading indicators, recoveries will probably remain limited to bear market rallies." The DJ Stoxx bank index was up 1.6 percent. The index is still down about 35 percent since reaching a peak last April as financial stocks have come under pressure from writedowns in the banking sector related to a credit crisis stemming from the risky U.S. subprime mortgage market. Mining shares rose as copper and other base metal prices gained ground. Anglo American added 2 percent and BHP Billiton gained 1.9 percent. France's Eramet surged more than 5 percent as traders said the company was seen as a potential takeover target following the collapse of bid talks between Brazil's Vale and Xstrata. Elsewhere, strong results propelled retailer Hennes & Mauritz, insurer Swiss Life and Austrian bank Raiffeisen, while German property lender Hypo Real Estate soared 14 percent on relief over its exposure to monoline insurers. "We are not seeing a dramatic impact on the non-financial sector yet, outside the U.S., from current woes. If that continues to be the case, then investors will begin to pay for the earnings that they see developing," said John Haynes, strategist at Rensburg Sheppard Investment Management. "But at the moment everybody is a bit too nervous to trust that the current consensus forecasts are accurate because they fear that they will be coming down shortly as the financial issues spill over into them." On the macro front, investors braced for final US quarterly GDP data expected to confirm economic weakness. "The speculation is that the US will now confirm that it is contracting. This will also have investors a little on the defensive and will probably continue the paralysis in the credit markets," Simon Denham, managing director of Capital Spreads, wrote in a note. "In this scenario, the temptation to just sit on the sidelines is almost overwhelming but there are always those looking to pick up good value equity when the moment appears righ
