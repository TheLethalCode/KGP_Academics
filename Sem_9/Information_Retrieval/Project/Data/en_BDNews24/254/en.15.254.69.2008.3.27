<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 27 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh Olympic Association (BOA) will see contest only for its secretary general post as none of the two candidates pulled out on the last date of nomination withdrawal Thursday. Immediate-past acting secretary general Kutubuddin Ahmed and former secretary general Golam Kuddus Chowdhury Babu will vie for the post, to be decided by 76 councilors. The BOA poll is scheduled for April 3. Of 37 posts in the executive committee, there were only single nominees for 35, thus rendering them unopposed. Out of 27 general members of the 37-member executive committee, one is fixed for an International Olympic Council, but Bangladesh have no such member and it remains vacant. Kutubuddin Thursday met the members of 'so-called' District Forum as a part of his election campaign.
