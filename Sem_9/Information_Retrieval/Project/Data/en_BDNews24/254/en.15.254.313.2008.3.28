 Tokyo, March 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Japanese government has urged schools to foster patriotism, including making sure primary school students can sing the national anthem, in new guidelines issued on Friday. The new rules come into line with Japan's basic law on education, which was revised in December 2006 under conservative former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to place greater emphasis on love of country. Previous draft guidelines, issued in February, were altered to beef up the patriotism content after ruling Liberal Democratic Party politicians complained that they did not reflect the content of the new law, the regional Tokyo Shimbun daily said. In the final version, posted on the Education Ministry's Web site, primary and middle schools are instructed to educate children to love Japan's traditions and culture. Children in all six grades of primary school should be taught the national anthem, "Kimigayo", the document says. "We want teachers to be more aware of this," the Tokyo Shimbun quoted a ministry official as saying of the emphasis on patriotism. "But it will not be reflected in children's grades." Abe stepped down in September and his successor, Yasuo Fukuda, was seen as ushering in a less nationalistic administration. Some Japanese are uncomfortable with the national anthem, an ancient poem set to a mournful 19th century melody, because of its association with Japan's militarist past. Some teachers have been disciplined for refusing to sing or accompany Kimigayo.
