 Abdur Rahim Harmachi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, March 29 (bdnews24.com)Rising international rice prices and falling global exports of the staple will not severely affect Bangladesh, a food ministry official said Saturday. In recent days, major global rice suppliers have said they will curtail overseas exports in an effort to combat food inflation at home, increasing food security worries round the world. The Indian government has hiked the minimum export price of non-basmati rice to $1,000 a tonne from $650, state-run news agency PSI reported on Thursday, which will effectively end overseas sales of all but the highest quality grades. Acting secretary of the food ministry Mollah Waheduzzaman told bdnews24.com Saturday: "Even if the rice price increases in the international market or a crisis arises, Bangladesh will not face a severe problem as the boro crop will be harvested soon." "A good boro harvest is expected this year. When the boro rice appears in the local market, prices will start falling." According to international media reports, Vietnam the world's second-biggest rice exporter after Thailandconfirmed the same day that it will cut rice exports by 22 percent this year from last year. Thailand has yet to impose restrictions, but there has been public discussion about doing so. Cambodia has also reportedly announced that it is halting all private sector rice exports, while Egypt is barring all rice exports starting April 1. The acting food secretary said: "We don't have any written document saying that India has raised the rice price to 1,000 dollars per tonne." "We have heard of it like you. We have also heard that Vietnam and Cambodia have imposed bans on export of rice considering their internal demands." However, I can tell you for sure that with the stock we have we will not face any problem in next two or two and a half months." Mollah Waheduzzaman said: "The country currently has a stock of 4.81 lakh metric tonnes of rice which is enough for more than two months." "The boro crop will appear in the market in the meantime. We expect a bumper boro crop this season. Boro rice will come to the market at the start of May. Then we will have no problem." The Bangladesh government has taken initiatives to import rice from Thailand, Vietnam and Myanmar as the Indian government has at different times imposed bans on rice export and increased the price. Meanwhile, the second round of talks between Bangladesh and India on fixing the prices and schedule for importing four lakh tonnes of rice from India was suspended Thursday without any decision. The two sides have said they will resume the meeting Sunday to reach a final decision. Global rice stocks have reached a 25-year low. Nearly half the planet's 6.6 billion people depend on rice to survive but rising populations and economic growth mean that the world is already eating more of the grain than is harvested. World rice inventories now stand at about 72 million tonnes, their lowest since the mid-1970s and enough to cover about 17 percent of global annual consumption, data from the US Department of Agriculture show. Just eight years ago stockpiles were equal to 35 percent of demand. bdnews
