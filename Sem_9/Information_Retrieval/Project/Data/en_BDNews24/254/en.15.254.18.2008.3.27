 LONDON, March 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The day after splashing pictures of her naked, Britain's tabloids hailed Carla Bruni as a fashion queen who could be the new Princess Diana. "What a difference a day makes ... and this time she remembered to put some clothes on," trumpeted The Daily Mail, which devoted a six-page spread to France's First Lady.

Headlines like "Enchante" and "Ooh La La, Madame Sarkozy" showed she is very much a presidential asset as far as the British press is concerned. Sarkozy, 53, separated from his second wife Cecilia last October following an 11-year marriage and just five months after winning power. By February he had married the 40-year-old Bruni.
