 Dhaka, March 29 (bdnews24.com) -- The Centre for Policy Dialogue raised a warning flag Saturday over possible moves by developed countries to withdraw agricultural subsidies leading to further hikes in the cost of staples in the international market. Mustafizur Rahman, the organisation's executive director, returned recently from a trip to the World Trade Organisation's headquarters in Geneva where he discussed trade issues as part of a CPD delegation. "Subsidies in the agricultural sector are now one of the most talked about issues worldwide," said Mustafizur at a press briefing at the think-tank's Dhanmondi office. He said a ministerial level meeting of the WTO is likely to be held in June, where the highly contentious issue of agricultural subsidies within developed countries would be discussed. "Developing countries including Brazil, China and India are now putting pressure on developed nations to withdraw their agricultural sector subsidies." "They are doing this in a bid to boost their own agricultural exports to those countries," Mustafizur said. But, the CPD executive director warned, if developed countries chose to withdraw or reduce agricultural subsidies then food prices, including rice, would increase in the world market. To meet the potential crises, Mustafizur said, the caretaker government must greatly increase domestic production. He added, however, that if Bangladesh could sufficiently increase agricultural production it would also be able to take advantage of the proposed subsidy cuts and sell commodities on the international market at higher prices. On a separate issue, Mustafizur said another WTO priority was trade assistance from developed countries to the world's least developed countries (LDCs). He said LDCs have yet to receive any substantive help, although the WTO had hinted that the matter would receive attention at the upcoming ministerial level meeting in June. "Bangladesh should prepare two complete project proposals for development of Mongla Port and the Dhaka-Chittagong Highway. We must bargain from now on to realise assistance for the two projects," he said. The CPD executive director added that a complete report on the delegation's visit with recommendations would be submitted to the caretaker government. bdnews
