 LONDON, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Top central bankers warned on Wednesday there was no end in sight to the global credit crunch as German banking giant Deutsche said the crisis threatened its profit target for this year. European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said the turbulence that has gripped financial markets since last summer would probably endure until the US housing market perked up. "Until conditions in the US housing markets show signs of improvements, the possibility of continuing tensions in structured credit markets cannot be excluded," Trichet told a European Parliament committee. "Large euro area banks are likely to face pressure on their revenues on account of lower activity levels in the structured credit markets as well as from a general retrenchment from risk-taking across business lines," he said. US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said housing prices needed to be allowed to continue to drop for now. "The sooner we work through it, with a minimum of disorder, the sooner we will see home values stabilise, more buyers return to the housing market, and housing will again contribute to economic growth," he told the US Chamber of Commerce. Europe has not escaped the credit crunch, which first bit in August when banks worldwide clammed up on lending to each other as it dawned on them that they did not know which were dangerously exposed to the US subprime mortgage meltdown. Securities based on home loans to Americans ill-equipped to pay them back have cost banks hundreds of billions of dollars in writeoffs, with more expected to come, and pushed US investment bank Bear Stearns to the brink of collapse. Backing Trichet's predictions, Deutsche Bank said asset writedowns and disruption to revenues stemming from the credit turmoil could put at risk its profit goal for this year of 8.4 billion euros ($13.2 billion). "The tone this morning is noticeably more bearish and indeed Deutsche has effectively given a (very lightly veiled) profit warning for 2008 on further fair value writedowns," RBS credit analysts said in a note to clients. Money market rates continued to show a marked reluctance to lend between banks despite periodic injections of massive liquidity by the world's major central banks. The interbank cost of borrowing three-month sterling edged up for the 12th session in a row to 6.00 percent, its highest since late December, while three-month euro Libor rates rose to 4.72063 percent, their highest level this year. GLOOMY KING Bank of England Governor Mervyn King was as downbeat as Trichet, saying the credit crunch had entered a new phase. "The financial crisis has moved into a new and difficult phase. Across the world, confidence in financial markets is fragile," King told a parliamentary committee. Despite apocalyptic warnings of a new "Great Depression", some confidence has returned on the back of sharp US rate cuts, central banks' efforts to prime money markets with as much liquidity as required and the orchestration of a takeover of Bear Stearns. But economic data continues to paint a mixed picture -- US home sales rose for the first time in seven months in February but home prices tumbled 3.0 percent year-on-year in January. Damage has spread far and wide, hitting takeover and merger activity too via tighter financing conditions. The $20 billion leveraged buyout of US radio operator Clear Channel Communications Inc is in jeopardy, with banks increasingly reluctant to provide financing, a source familiar with the situation said on Tuesday. If the deal falls apart, it would be the latest in a series of leveraged buyouts to fail since the credit crisis began. In Europe, the picture seems brighter. Corporate morale in Germany posted a surprise rise in March to its highest level in seven months, the Ifo research institute's monthly poll of around 7,000 firms showed on Wednesday, while French business sentiment also rose unexpectedly, reaching its highest level so far this year. The ECB has not followed the Federal Reserve's lead in lowering official interest rates and the Bank of England has also proved more reluctant to ease policy. King said the BoE stood ready to provide liquidity as needed and was working with commercial banks to seek a resolution to the crisis. But such a solution, he said, should be paid for by shareholders in the banks which took risks, not taxpayers. At a meeting last week, Britain's top bankers urged the Bank to be more generous and flexible to help fragile money markets. King said the BoE should not follow the Fed's example with big rate cuts and said central banks were taking similar action to ease lending conditions by providing funds as required.
