 JAKARTA, March 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serbia wants to govern ethnic Serb areas in Kosovo under an interim agreement with the United Nations mission there, the Serbian foreign minister said on Thursday, adding that such a plan would not involve partitioning Kosovo. Kosovo's 90 percent Albanian majority declared independence from Serbia on Feb. 17 with Western support, although the move was branded illegal by Belgrade. About 120,000 Serbs still live in Kosovo. Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic, on a visit to Indonesia, said an interim agreement on a separate administration for Kosovo Serbs was necessary to avoid violent conflict.

The Albanians, the West and the Serbs have insisted for their own reasons in the past that partition is not an option, although some Western diplomats suspect it has always been on the Serb agenda as a "plan B". The government of Serbia would continue pushing for integration with the European Union, Jeremic said, despite remarks by nationalist Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica that Serbs should be prepared to defer EU membership for "many, many years". "This is the only way in which we can stabilise our part of the world and in which we can achieve progress," he said. "One thing is for sure, the future of southeast Europe (western Balkans) is in the European Union." Kostunica said on Tuesday that until the West reversed its recognition of Kosovo, Serbia should "cooperate with" the EU without becoming a memb
