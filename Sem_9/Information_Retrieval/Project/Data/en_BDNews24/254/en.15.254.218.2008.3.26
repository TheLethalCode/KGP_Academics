 BAMAKO, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Suspected Tuareg rebels on Wednesday raided a remote town in northern Mali close to where al Qaeda militants are thought to be holding two Austrian tourists hostage, a military source said. Tuareg attacks since last week appear unrelated to the kidnapping of the Austrians, whose captors this week extended to April 6 a deadline for the release of militants held in Algeria and Tunisia. Security sources say they also seek a cash ransom. Gunmen driving pick-up trucks attacked the Sahara Desert town of Aguelhok at dawn, said a military official in Mali's capital Bamako who was in contact with loyalist forces in the area. "Enemy Toyotas are circling around the town and firing often on the (army) camp. Our men are shooting back from their positions," the official said. He declined to be identified. "We think the gunfire is intended to draw our men out so they (the attackers) can take the town," the official said. Aguelhok lies in Mali's northern Kidal region, on the main route across the Sahara into Algeria and about 175 km (110 miles) from the border crossing. Al Qaeda's north African wing is believed to be holding Austrian tourists Andrea Kloiber, 43, and Wolfgang Ebner, 51, at at an Islamist hideout also in the vast Kidal region. The group has demanded freedom for 10 militants held in Algeria and Tunisia in return for releasing the pair. Algerian security sources have said the captors also demanded a ransom. Some Malian government officials have said in recent days they suspect Algerian-based al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb might have moved their hostages over the remote border into Algeria or Niger since the upsurge in Tuareg violence last week. Government officials in Austria, which has sent a diplomat to Mali to try to secure the release of the tourists, have said the Tuareg violence should not affect their efforts. But the fighting is a major distraction for the Malian government, which has promised to do what it can to assist the negotiations, and had appealed to local Tuareg community leaders to act as go-betweens or mediators in the hostage crisis. Around 30 Malian army soldiers were captured last week by Tuareg fighters who attacked a military convoy. Malian Foreign Minister Moctar Ouane summoned the diplomatic corps on Monday and said the government would use "all necessary means" to free the captured soldiers, most of whom were wounded and had been captured during evacuation by the Red Cross. He accused Malian Tuareg rebel leader Ibrahim Ag Bahanga of breaking a ceasefire between Mali's Tuareg rebels and the army which had lasted several months despite continuing Tuareg rebel activities over the eastern border in uranium-rich Niger.
