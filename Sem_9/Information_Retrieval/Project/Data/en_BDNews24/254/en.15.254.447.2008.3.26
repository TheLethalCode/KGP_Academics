<TITLE> Britain seals $26 bln air tanker deal -sources </TITLE>

 PARIS, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain is set to announce a deal to buy Airbus A330 refuelling tankers after a bank loan rescued plans for the world's largest public-private funding project, sources close to the deal said on Wednesday. The deal is expected to be announced on Thursday during a state visit to Britain by French President Nicolas Sarkozy, although it is not officially part of his programme, and comes weeks after a deal to supply similar jets to the United States. "The financing is fully committed," a source close to the deal said. Others said plans for a bond linked to the initial financing phase had been dropped due to global market turmoil and had been replaced with a loan. The first phase of the project calls for total capital investment of 2 billion pounds ($4 billion). The project is seen worth an estimated $26 billion over its 27-year lifetime. Britain is buying the planes under its Private Finance Initiative, a funding scheme used in the past to lease public services such as hospitals from the private sector. Officials say the deal, put together by Deutsche Bank, is the world's biggest public-private partnership. In 2005, the Royal Air Force selected a consortium of European aerospace firms to buy the aircraft from Airbus and lease them to the Ministry of Defence when needed. But talks over the financing have dragged on far longer than expected. The AirTanker consortium includes Cobham, Rolls-Royce and VT Group of Britain, the UK subsidiary of French electronics firm Thales and EADS, the European parent company of Toulouse-based planemaker Airbus. A spokesman for AirTanker declined comment. Britain's defence ministry said it could not confirm the deal or announcement plans. The specially converted Airbus passenger jets will replace decades-old VC-10 and Tristar models and can alternate between aerial refuelling and troop transport. The planes carry fuel in their normal wing tanks and have space for up to 300 troops in a normal passenger cabin as well as 8 tonnes of equipment. They will enter service from 2011. Under the deal, AirTanker will be able to rent out the planes when they are not needed for defence -- raising the prospect of charter tourists flying aboard refuelling planes. Critics of the PFI, pioneered by Britain's Conservatives in the 1990s, say it leads to short-cuts on spending and has put patients' health at risk in hospital schemes. Air forces worldwide are racing to renew their aerial refuelling fleets as military planners adapt to dispersed threats to their security further away from their home base. Britain's purchase of European tankers comes on top of orders from Australia, the UAE and Saudi Arabia and most recently the U.S. Air Force which selected Airbus over Boeing, sparking a row in Congress over security and jobs. FUNDING SNAGS Britain's 13 billion pounds ($26 billion) tanker replacement plan, dubbed Future Strategic Air Tanker, is one of several big-ticket defence projects that have been subject to doubts over funding or possible cuts in defence budgets. Others include a plan to build two aircraft carriers in co-operation with the French, who plan their own carrier. Britain opted to go ahead with its own carriers last year but France is unlikely to finalise its plans to build a carrier until after a defence review due this Spring. Sarkozy and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown are likely to discuss French calls for more European defence coordination, which Paris wants to promote when it holds the European Union's rotating presidency in the second half of this year. France aims to boost the role of the EU's fledgling European Defence Agency in rationalising competing military programmes, while maintaining its own fighter jets and nuclear deterrent. European leaders are also concerned about delays of 6-12 months in the A400M military heavylifter, the region's biggest future military project which is led by a subsidiary of EADS. Sarkozy has signalled France may be ready to return to NATO's military structures after 41 years, but analysts say Paris is likely to want progress on establishing a stronger European defence identity during its EU presidency. Diplomats say Britain is unlikely to do or say anything that would compromise its close defence and industrial ties with the United States in order not to provoke domestic eurosceptics as a controversial EU reform treaty works its way through parliament.
