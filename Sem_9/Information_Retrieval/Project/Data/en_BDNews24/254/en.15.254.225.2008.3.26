 NEW DELHI, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian army engineers were struggling on Wednesday to rescue a two-year-old girl trapped down a 45-feet (14 metres) well for almost a day near the Taj Mahal town of Agra. The girl, named Vandana, fell into the well while playing with her friends and was now being supplied with oxygen through a tube, an army spokesman said. "The child is alive and well and we are on the verge of rescuing her," he said, adding the girl was intermittently crying out in fear. Hundreds of people gathered around the well in Tehra village to see the army men rescue the girl, who had eaten biscuits and water sent down to her. In 2006, army engineers carried out a similar operation to rescue a five-year-old boy two days after he accidentally fell into a well in northern India.
