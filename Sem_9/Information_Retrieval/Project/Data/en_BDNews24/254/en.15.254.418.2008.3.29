<TEXT>
 BRDO, Slovenia, March 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union was set to call on Saturday for an end to repression in Tibet and urge China to hold a dialogue on Tibetan cultural and religious rights, a draft document obtained by Reuters showed. "The EU condemns all violence and pays its respect to the victims. It calls for an end to the repression and asks that arrested persons be treated in conformity with international standards," the draft prepared for the 27 EU foreign ministers said. They were discussing the issue at the final session of a two-day meeting in Slovenia. The text called for a "necessary, substantive and constructive dialogue" without mentioning the Dalai Lama by name, and said: "Understanding the importance of the Olympic Games, the Euorpean Union stands ready to contribute to the resumption of this dialogue."
