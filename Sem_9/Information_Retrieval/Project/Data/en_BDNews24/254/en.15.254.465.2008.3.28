 Mymensingh, March 28 (bdnews24.com)Train links between Dhaka and Jagannathganj Ghat resumed Friday after 13 hours of disruptions, said a Mymensingh railway junction official. Station superintendent Nazrul Islam told bdnews24.com: "The rescue operation started around 8pm Thursday and railway links were restored Friday morning." Eight compartments of the Dhaka-bound intercity train Teesta Express travelling from Bahadurabad Ghat derailed at 5pm Thursday in Begunbari area of Mymensingh, forcing passengers to leap off the train. Witnesses said the train left for Dhaka from Dewanganj in Jamalpur at 3.30pm Thursday. A number of passengers suffered minor injuries. The train was travelling at slow speed, which apparently averted fatalities. Divisional traffic officer for Bangladesh Railway Abdul Muquit told bdnews24.com that two recovery trains had rushed to the accident site from Dhaka and Mymensingh to haul up the derailed compartments. The accident disrupted the services of some other trains in and out of Dhaka. bdnews24.com/c
