 Dhaka, March 26 (bdnews24.com)The jail authorities have suspended for three months division to four VIP detainees in different jails, a prisons official said Wednesday. Also, punitive measures have been taken against a fifth detainee without VIP status. The action was taken against them on charges of using cellphones inside jail, which is banned in line with the Jail Code. The VIP detainees are: Barrister Nazmul Huda, Altaf Hossain Chowdhury, Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury and Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir Huda and Altaf Hossain are now in Narayanganj jail, SQ Chowdhury in Bogra jail and Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir in Kashimpur jail Sigma Huda, now in Dhaka Central Jail, will be barred from meeting with relatives. Deputy inspector general of prisons major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told bdnewsd24.com that the all detainees except for Sigma Huda had enjoyed division. He said the decision was taken off on Tuesday and orders reached the jails Wednesday. The division holders get small cots, newspapers and other facilities. Like ordinary detainees they have to sleep on quilts on the floor. Siddiqui said there were the same allegations against some others. On the basis of the allegations, six detainees have been sent out of Dhaka Tuesday. "If necessary, punitive measures including cancellation of division will be taken against them as well," he said. bdnew
