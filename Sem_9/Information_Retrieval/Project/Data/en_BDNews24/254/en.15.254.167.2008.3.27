 TASHKENT, March 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States urged Uzbekistan on Thursday to engage in a dialogue which it says would benefit the Central Asian nation long at odds with the West over human rights issues. Uzbekistan's relations with Washington have been chilly since 2005 when the United States and other Western nations condemned its deadly crackdown on a protest in the eastern town of Andizhan. But, in a possible sign of political relaxation in a country the West says tolerates little dissent, the government has pardoned six jailed human rights activists this year. President Islam Karimov, ruling Central Asia's most populous nation since 1989, has also promised to liberalise Uzbekistan's rigid financial system and he has softened his critical stance towards the West. Some Tashkent diplomats have linked the shift in Uzbekistan's stance to Karimov's bid to emerge from global isolation. Uzbekistan has large gas and oil reserves and is also among the world's top 10 gold producers and the No. 2 cotton exporter. Acting U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Central Asia Pamela Spratlen was due to arrive in the Uzbek capital Tashkent for talks later on Thursday, an embassy statement said. "We are convinced that the involvement of the Uzbek government in a discussion on a broad range of topics that are on our bilateral agenda," the statement quoted U.S. Ambassador to Uzbekistan Richard Norland as saying. He listed potential topics as regional safety, trade and investment, cultural exchange and human rights. "We can see now that, unlike calls for isolation, international interest and interaction with the Uzbek authorities can lead to positive steps." Uzbekistan, previously a U.S. ally in its so-called war on terror, evicted U.S. troops from a local military airbase after Washington strongly criticised the violence in Andizhan, which President Karimov blamed on Islamist rebels. The government said 187 mostly "terrorists" and security people were killed but witnesses said hundreds of people died. Human rights bodies say there are at least 5,000 religious and political prisoners in Uzbekistan, where only state-sponsored Islam is allowed.
