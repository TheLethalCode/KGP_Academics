 ROME, March 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Inter Milan maintained their four-point lead in Serie A after drawing 1-1 at Lazio while AS Roma managed the same score at lowly Cagliari on Saturday. Hernan Crespo put reigning champions Inter ahead when he stabbed in Maicon's early cross but the visitors were often sloppy and paid the price when Tommaso Rocchi beat the offside trap and scuffed the ball home in the second half. Mid-table Lazio deserved to win with midfielder Ousmane Dabo forcing Inter goalkeeper Julio Cesar into a superb save and then rattling the bar with a stinging shot late on. Valon Behrami also went close and had a penalty appeal turned down. Inter, who lost their second league match this season at home to Juventus last weekend, had a troubled build-up to the game with more confusion about coach Roberto Mancini's future. Jose Mourinho's personal adviser said on Friday the Portuguese had gone to hold talks with Inter although the former Chelsea coach has denied going to Milan, meeting club president Massimo Moratti or being close to signing a deal. Inter made no official statement and Mancini, who said earlier this month he would quit in May before changing his mind, looked calm on the bench. Second-placed Roma failed to put full pressure on Inter but had the chances to leave Sardinia with more than a point. Cagliari, who won their appeal on Wednesday against a three-point deduction for a legal wrangle, went ahead after three minutes when a corner hit Roma defender Matteo Ferrari and rolled in. Roma, at home to Manchester United in Tuesday's Champions League quarter-final first leg, increased the tempo and Brazilian Mancini missed badly before also striking the post. The pressure paid off when Francesco Totti brought the visitors level just before halftime with a long-range free kick which crept into the corner. Roma substitute Alberto Aquilani headed wide from close in moments after coming on and then had a backheel saved by impressive home goalkeeper Marco Storari, who also kept out Totti's header late on. With seven games left for the two sides, Inter have 69 points and Roma are on 65. Third-placed Juventus, seven behind Roma, host Parma on Sunday with AC Milan in fifth entertaining Atalanta as they desperately battle to finish in a Champions League berth
