 Harare, March 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe placed security forces on full alert ahead of Saturday's poll to quash any violence and will not allow candidates to declare themselves winners before official results, police chief Augustine Chihuri said on Friday. "We wish to advise the nation that all the defence and security forces of Zimbabwe are on full alert from now onwards covering the election period and beyond," Chihuri told a media conference. "We are not going to allow a situation where individuals arrogate themselves winners at any stage of the electoral process," said Chihuri, flanked by the chiefs of all of the country's army and security services.
