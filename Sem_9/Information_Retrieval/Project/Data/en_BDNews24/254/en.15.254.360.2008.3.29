 Dhaka, March 29 (bdnews24.com)-Awami League is set to organise mass hunger strike programmes throughout the country before April 20 to press home its demands for the release of Shiekh Hasina, the trial of 'war criminals', withdrawal of the state of emergency and announcement of an election schedule. The party will also protest the spiralling price of essential commodities as well as what it termed as the deterioration of law and order. The decision was taken at a meeting of the party's working committee at the AL president's political office in Dhanmondi Saturday AL acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam, told reporters after the meeting. However, party policymakers could not give any specific date for the programme. The Awami League central working committee in its resolution demanded immediate unconditional release of Sheikh Hasina and permission for her to go abroad for effective medical treatment. Speaking after the meeting, Ashraful also requested the government to organise dialogue with the political parties. Asked whether AL would participate if all parties, including Jamaat-e-Islami, were invited to the dialogue, he said: "Where the war criminals are invited, Awami League will not go there." "We hope that the government will not foil the dialogue by inviting Jamaat," he said. Expressing concern at the continuing price hike of essentials, Ashraful said: "People are bearing it silently. But they will not tolerate any more. The present situation would not have arisen if the government had taken proper steps and had a good food stock." Calling the present situation a "famine," he demanded that two crore people throughout the country be brought under the purview of Vulnerable Group Feeding programmes. He also said rural public works programmes, food for work programmes and ration cards should be introduced on a massive scale. The party demanded release of all political detainees, including Abdul Jalil, the immediate announcement of the Jatiya Sangsad election schedule before any other election, withdrawal of the state of emergency and removal of ban on trade union activities. AL acting president Zillur Rahman presided over the meeting, with members of the party's working committee in Dhaka attending. bdnews24.co
