 Dhaka, Mar 29 (bdnews24.com)Real estate developers have chosen a new team to lead them through an industry crisis amid poor sales and the high price of raw materials. Former general secretary of the Real Estate and Housing Association of Bangladesh (REHAB) Tanveerul Haque Probal is set to take over as president, after his 'Nobodhara' panel won by clinching 11 out of 21 executive committee seats. The opposing panel, led by managing director of Capitaland Development Mokarram Hossain, bagged the remaining 10 seats, the association's chief election commissioner Iftekhar A Khan told bdnews24.com at 11.30pm Saturday immediately after announcing the results. "The election was held under free and fair conditions. After the results, both panels have agreed to work together," Khan said. Of the 354 voters, 318 cast their ballots, he said. The 21 newly elected members will appoint a new president, a senior vice president, a vice president, a general secretary and a treasurer. Probal, who runs Building for Future Ltd, told bdnews24.com that he did not see a problem in becoming president following his panel's victory. bdnews
