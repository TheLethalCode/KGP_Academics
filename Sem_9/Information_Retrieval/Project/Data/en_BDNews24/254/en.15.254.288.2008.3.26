<TITLE> World wine body says production falling </TITLE>

 PARIS, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Worldwide wine production is falling as traditional consumers worry about their health and vines are destroyed either deliberately or by drought, a leading industry body said on Wednesday. The International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV) said about 266.7 million hectolitres of wine was produced in 2007, 6.9 percent less than in the previous year, while consumption was roughly unchanged at 240.6 million hectolitres. About 7.899 million hectares (19.52 million acres) of land was given over to wine production in 2007, down from 7.908 million a year before. The sharpest production decline has been in Europe, where the European Commission wants sweeping changes to wine policy -- including cash incentives for producers to dig up their vines -- to finally drain the European Union's lakes of surplus wine. Europe's five leading wine exporters -- Germany, France, Italy, Portugal and Spain -- have seen their share of world trade slip to 61.8 percent in 2007, from an average 78.8 percent in the late 1980s. OIV Secretary-General Federico Castellucci told a news conference that falling consumption could cause particular problems for winemakers in countries where domestic demand has traditionally underpinned production, such as Italy. The OIV is an intergovernmental organisation for work on vines, wine, wine-based beverages, table grapes, raisins and other vine-based products. The share of the world wine trade taken by southern hemisphere producers -- Argentina, Chile, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand -- climbed to 28 percent in 2007 from 3.1 percent in 1986-1990. So-called new world wine countries are also drinking more, while consumption of 26.5 million hectolitres in the United States last year easily outstripped the 20 million hectolitres it produced. "We welcome new production countries but we especially need new consumer countries," Castellucci said. Referring to the United States, he said: "There has been a big marketing effort by the local industry and that is benefiting the wine imports as well." Production in Brazil is also increasing and Castellucci said the country would become a wine force to be reckoned with. China and India are also developing their own wine industries, but Castellucci said rising demand from local consumers meant he did not expect either country to become a big exporter soon.
