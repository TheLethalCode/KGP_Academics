 BUENOS AIRES, March 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Protesters for and against a two-week farm strike scuffled in Argentina's capital on Wednesday as a conflict over soy export taxes ballooned into a major crisis for President Cristina Fernandez. In the vast farmlands spreading out from Buenos Aires farmers vowed to keep striking until Fernandez -- who took office in December -- repeals a tax hike on grain exports, undeterred by government threats to break up road blockades. The farm action has led to shortages of meat and dairy products in agricultural powerhouse Argentina, paralyzed grain and livestock trade and forced major soy exporters to renege on some contracts, affecting buyers in commodity-hungry China. Neither the president nor farmers have given signs of backing down despite calls from religious leaders and provincial governors for a negotiated way out. For a second night, thousands of people rallied against the center-left government, banging pots and pans in plazas. "She's so arrogant, the president, instead of trying to unify people, to reconcile them, she's seeking confrontation," said Felisa, a 60-year-old music professor protesting outside the presidential residence in an upper-middle-class suburb of the capital. She did not want to give her last name. In downtown Buenos Aires pro-farmer groups briefly clashed with fists and sticks with pro-government groups led by controversial former cabinet minister Luis D'Elia. "We are not going to allow these 'protests of abundance,'" said D'Elia, quoting the president's tough speech against farmers a day earlier. Elsewhere, farmers blockaded highways, burned old harvesting machines and dumped milk on roads. "The government tried to put out the fire with gasoline," farmer Hector Boldrini said at a roadside protest in Pergamino, in the fertile northern region of Buenos Aires province. "There's no way we'll cede ground." FARMERS BOILED OVER Argentina has been one of the world's main beneficiaries of a global surge in commodities prices. But farmers abhor measures adopted by Fernandez and her predecessor and husband, Nestor Kirchner, such as export bans and price controls, aimed at taming inflation and boosting state revenue. The long-seething farm sector boiled over when the government decreed a new sliding-scale export tax regime that raises levies on soy and sunflower products. President Fernandez has defended the taxes, saying they help redistribute wealth in a country where nearly a quarter of the people are poor. "The government is not against the farm sector. Farmers' profits have never been as high as they are today." her cabinet chief, Alberto Fernandez, said on Wednesday. But officials also said the government would clear the roads by force if necessary to get food to market. Several suppliers of Argentine soy and soy oil declared force majeure on cargoes to China due to the protest, following a similar move on soy meal shipments to Europe, according to traders and industry officials. While U.S. and Brazilian soy products can plug some holes, they cannot fully replace goods from Argentina, one of the world's top suppliers of soy, corn, wheat and beef. The strike has slashed foreign currency inflows, sending the peso currency to its lowest level in five months. Government bond prices also fell on Wednesday as the strike exposed the country's weak institutions. Baby formula has gone missing at some Buenos Aires stores, and many supermarkets had empty meat counters on Wednesday. "The government will take the necessary measures to ensure there are no shortages. ... We have to guarantee people's food supplies," said Economy Minister Martin Lousteau
