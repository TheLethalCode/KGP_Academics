 Dhaka, March 30 (bdnews24.com)Germany will pile 'pressure' on the caretaker government to hold the next general election if it does not keep to the year-end deadline for the polls, said the head of a visiting German parliamentary delegation Sunday. In a news briefing at Zia International Airport before leaving Dhaka, Thilo Hoppe, head of the six-member German delegation, also said the political parties must carry out reforms before elections and ensure "internal democracy". He hoped that the polls would be held by year-end. "If we see (that) it is the government that does not want to part from power, we will certainly not show any sort of understanding for this," said Hoppe, who used an interpreter for English. "And we will exert some pressure and advocate elections to be held soon," he said. "We are optimistic that the elections will be held in time. If not, Germany will have to enter a critical dialogue with the government for the reasons behind postponing the elections," Hoppe said. "If there is a danger of falling (back) in a situation like before, then we will have some sort of understanding." Stressing the need for democracy in political parties, Hoppe said election candidates must be nominated from the grassroots level. "The state of emergency should be lifted so that the candidates can start election activities," said Hoppe, chairman of the German Parliamentary Committee on Economic Development. The German delegation had met foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury and civil society and NGO representatives, journalists and other professionals. Dr Wolfgang Wodarg, a German MP and member of the delegation, later told bdnews24.com that Hoppe should have used the term "political influence" instead of "pressure" on the government. bdn
