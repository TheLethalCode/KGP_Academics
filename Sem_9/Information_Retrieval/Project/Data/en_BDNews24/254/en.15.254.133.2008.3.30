 Dhaka, March 30 (bdnews24.com) -- A high-level Saudi delegation is scheduled to arrive in Dhaka on April 7 to discuss labour issues between the two countries and other bilateral concerns, an adviser said Sunday. "Issues relating to Bangladeshi nationals working in Saudi Arabia will be a major item on the agenda," foreign affairs adviser Iftekahr Ahmed Chowdhury told reporters in his office. Ahmed Abdulraham Al-Mansour, the Saudi deputy labour minister, will lead the delegation on their two-day visit. The delegation's visit stems from a request the foreign adviser made to high-ranking Saudi officials on the sidelines of the recent Organisation of the Islamic Conference summit in Senegal. A police crackdown in the kingdom for alleged cases of Bangladeshi workers breaking the law or overstaying their visas has recently strained relations between the two countries. The Saudi government had imposed a ban on Bangladeshis working in the agricultural sector or being employed in private houses. The kingdom, however, has made it clear that it is keen to recruit skilled professionals such as doctors, engineers or technical experts. There are currently over 17.5 lakh Bangladeshis working in Saudi Arabia. bdn
