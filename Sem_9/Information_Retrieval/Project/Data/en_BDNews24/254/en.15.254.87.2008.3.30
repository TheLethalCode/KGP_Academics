 Dhaka, March 30 (bdnews24.com)Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina Sunday alleged that she was forced to appear in court. The Awami League chief was discharged from Square Hospital shortly after 2pm, its general manager James Gomes told bdnews24.com. In court, Hasina alleged that her medical treatment had not been complete and taken to court by force. The detained Awami League president was taken back to special jail from court at 3:14pm. Hasina appeared in court on the Sangsad Bhaban premises for the first time since she had been admitted to Square Hospital on March 11. The court resumed a hearing in a case against Hasina, which accuses her of illegally awarding contracts for three barge-mounted power plants during her term as prime minister. bdnews
