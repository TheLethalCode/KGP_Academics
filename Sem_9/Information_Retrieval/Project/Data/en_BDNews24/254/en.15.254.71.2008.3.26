 BRUSSELS, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The head of the European Parliament invited the Dalai Lama on Wednesday to address the EU legislature on events in Tibet and questioned whether European leaders should attend the opening of the Beijing Olympic Games. Opening an emergency debate on events in Tibet, Parliament President Hans-Gert Poettering said: "I put it to this house to join with me in saying that the Dalai Lama is welcome in this house whenever he wants to come." He urged the Chinese authorities to seek a solution to the unrest through dialogue with the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, respecting China's territorial integrity. "I genuinely say that all politicians must ask themselves whether they can attend the opening ceremony if China fails to take part in dialogue," Poettering said, adding he expected the Dalai Lama to attend the EU assembly in December.
