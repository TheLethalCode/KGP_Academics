 Dhaka, March 27 (bdnews24.com)The second round of talks between Bangladesh and India on fixing the prices and schedule of importing four lakh tonnes of rice from India was suspended Thursday without any decision. The two sides will resume the meeting Sunday to reach a final decision. An agreement will be signed with Indian exporters when the decision is finalised, director of the Food Directorate Elahi Dad Khan told reporters. The first two meetings were held on March 17-18, with the third starting after a 12-day pause. Director general of the Food Directorate Pius Costa led the Bangladesh team that included directors Elahi Dad Khan, Siddiqur Rahman and Abdul Halim. The Indian team of four rice exporting firms was led by TPS Narayan. After the meeting, Khan said, time is being given more importance over prices in imports of the four lakh tonnes of the five lakh tonnes pledged by India. The Indian delegates have agreed to release the shipments in 60 days instead of 90 days from agreement. Bangladesh has asked them to give the shipments in 45 days. Khan also said: "We are importing rice for distribution, not for sale." bdnew
