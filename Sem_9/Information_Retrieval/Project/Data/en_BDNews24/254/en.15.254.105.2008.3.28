 London, March 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks followed Asia's lead on Friday, turning higher at the end of a volatile last full week of a ferocious quarter, while the dollar clawed higher as investors braced for key US inflation data. But liquidity worries hung heavy over sentiment as short-term money market rates ratcheted up, with end-quarter demand stretching already tight conditions. The dollar's gain undermined commodities slightly as gold and oil fell. The FTSEurofirst 300 of top European shares was up 0.2 percent at 1274.74 points after a shaky start. Japan's Nikkei average rose 1.7 percent. But with one more session to go after Friday, the index was on track for its worst quarter since the third quarter of 2002. British bank Lloyds TSB fell 2.4 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported that the man who runs its UK retail banking business would move to Citigroup. Among other banking stocks, UBS was also weaker. "The market's nervous at the moment and I'd be happy to get away with a relatively dull day at the end of a short week," said Justin Urquhart Stewart at 7 Investment Management. Investors have been weighed down by worries the credit crisis may yet claim more victims on Wall Street following market rumours that Lehman Brothers could be the next bank to fall, rumours Lehman said were "totally unfounded". Citigroup said in a note to clients that Lehman shares were ripe for the picking, with current valuations seen as extremely attractive. "It's tough to have a liquidity-driven meltdown when you're being backed by government entities that have the ability to print money. Lehman has ample liquidity to run its business," Citi said. But the global credit crunch that started in August last year continued to weigh on money markets, with short-term deposit rates used for interbank lending reaching high levels. Euro deposit rates for tomorrow-next day were indicated as high as 4.42 percent, the highest since late 2001 and some 42 basis points over the European Central Bank base rate. INFLATION KEY With U.S. economic health at the forefront of investors minds, core inflation data due at 1230 GMT is expected to give clues on the depth of monetary easing expected from the Fed as it tries to stave off recession. Federal Reserve policymakers on Thursday painted a bleak picture of the ailing economy and reiterated commitment to cutting rates to cushion the pain. While the dollar was generally firmer at $1.5765 and 99.99 yen, analysts said the broader downtrend was firmly intact. "Comments from the Fed overnight continue to paint a grim picture of the situation in the U.S. and there's an increasing risk of the U.S. moving into a recession so in the near term the outlook is for the dollar to continue weakening," said Ian Stannard, senior forex strategist at BNP Paribas. Gold fell to $942.60, some $10 below late New York levels on Thursday as the dollar gained, while crude was down 48 cents at $107.10 a barrel. Oil traders, wary over the U.S. economic outlook, took profits from a three-day rally and were cheered by news that Iraq's oil pipeline system was back flowing at normal levels.
