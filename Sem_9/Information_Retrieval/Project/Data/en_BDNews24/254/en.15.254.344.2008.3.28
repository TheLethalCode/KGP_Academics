<TITLE> India`s tech hub catches dogs after plane hit </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Bangalore, India, March 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Authorities in India's technology capital began clearing stray dogs from the city airport on Friday, a day after an aircraft's landing gear collapsed after hitting a dog. Three people were slightly injured in that accident during take-off, which prompted the civic body to catch dogs that wander on to runways. Within hours, six dogs had been caught. The strays would be sterilised and kept in a pound. "We caught three dogs inside the airport area and three outside," a civic official said. "The drive will continue." Bangalore, which has about 70,000 stray dogs, issued an order to kill them last year after several children died from dog bites. But protests from animal rights groups stalled that decision. Instead, all dogs caught are sterilised.
