<TITLE> FTSE slips as Vale ditches Xstrata, pharmas fall </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's top share index edged down on Wednesday as Xstrata sank after the collapse of talks with Brazil's Vale to buy the miner and drugmakers fell after bearish comments from Morgan Stanley. By 1145 GMT, the FTSE 100 was down 25.2 points, or 0.4 percent at 5,663.9, though index heavyweight Vodafone offered some support, up 2.8 percent after it said it expected to start receiving dividends from its US joint venture Verizon Wireless next year. The UK benchmark index has fallen 12 percent so far this year on fears of a US recession stemming from a meltdown in risky subprime mortgages, and is on track for its worst quarter since the third quarter of 2002 and its third straight quarter of losses. Analysts said that despite some bad news, shares were holding up reasonably well. "Things don't look so bad today, given the size of yesterday's rally and the news on Xstrata," said Tim Hughes, head of sales trading at IG Index. "The optimism does seem to be hanging in there." Xstrata was down 7.8 percent after Vale said talks to buy the Anglo-Swiss rival had failed. The rest of the sector, however, traded higher as metal prices stayed firm and after Kazakhmys said it welcomed a recent statement by the Kazakhstan government that it wished to take a minority interest of up to 15 percent in the miner. Kazakhmys rose 4 percent, while Anglo American added 3.7 percent, Lonmin put on 3.1 percent and Antofagasta advanced 2 percent. Banks were among the standout losing sector, with Barclays, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland, HBOS and Standard Chartered losing between 0.7 and 1.5 percent. Bank of England Governor Mervyn King said tighter lending conditions had made the central bank more inclined to cut interest rates as the credit crunch entered a new and difficult phase. Also weighing on the sector, Germany's Deutsche Bank said the disruption to revenues and writedowns on assets stemming from global credit turmoil could put its profit goal for this year at risk. Elsewhere in the financial sector, Friends Provident rose 1.1 percent after the Financial Times said JC Flowers was working on a fresh approach to the life assurer. BROKERAGE AstraZeneca dropped 2.6 percent and GlaxoSmithKline lost 2 percent after Morgan Stanley cut its price target on both stocks. Sainsbury added 3.3 percent after its fourth quarter like-for-like sales excluding fuel came in above expectations and said it saw "strong growth" in sales of non-food items. The supermarket group also said it had signed a property joint venture worth 1.2 billion pounds with British Land. US durable goods and new home sales data for February will provide a further gauge of the health of the world's largest economy with the first figures due from 1230 GMT. Aviva, BSkyB, Wolseley, Capita Group, InterContinental Hotels and Smiths Group were all down as they traded without the right to dividend.
