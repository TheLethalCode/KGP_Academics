 Manila, March 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Philippines has suspended the local partner of a US-based helicopter maker from bidding for state contracts for one year for attempting to mislead the government in a 2007 tender, a defence official said on Friday. The defence department's bids and award committee has also recommended filing a criminal complaint against Asian Aerospace Corporation for violating procurement laws, according to documents seen by Reuters. In September 2007, Asian Aerospace Corp, a local partner of MD Helicopters, won a government contract to sell six MD530F night-capable attack helicopters for 1.2 billion pesos ($28.6 million). But a review of the bidding process showed that MD530F did not meet the technical specifications required by the Philippine Air Force, the documents said. The price also appeared to be inflated since Asian Aerospace had previously offered 12 of the same helicopters for nearly the same price, according to the documents. On Jan 25, the defence department halted the award of the helicopter supply contract after an inquiry showed irregularities in the tender procedures. Several defence and military officials who participated in the bidding process are facing an inquiry. A defence official, who declined to be named because he was not authorised to speak to reporters, confirmed Asian Aerospcace had been blocked for one year from participating in bidding for government contracts. "The bigger issue here is they are not being able to bid for the 3.2 billion pesos helicopter contract," the official said. Nelson Victorino, a defence department spokesman, said the government will bid out contracts for about 14 helicopters, including the six sought earlier, before June 2008. The company said it had not received any notice of the blacklisting. "There's no basis for any suspension," Peter Rodriguez, president of Asian Aerospace, told Reuters, adding his company has appealed against the decision by the government to scrap the helicopter contract. "We were the ones that called the government's attention on some flaws in the contract. Why would the government penalise us?" President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo has allocated about 7 billion pesos to upgrade the military's fleet of Vietnam-era aircraft, part of a long-term 210 billion peso modernisation plan to catch up with better-quipped neighbours in Southeast Asia. The Philippines has 85 UH-1H and 22 MD520 attack helicopters, but only about half of them are in flying condition. Most of the aircraft were donated by the United States as part of its military aid.
