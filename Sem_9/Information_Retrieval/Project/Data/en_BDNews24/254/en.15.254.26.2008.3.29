 Zagreb, March 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - More than 50 non-governmental organisations in Croatia launched a petition on Saturday calling for a referendum on its accession to NATO. Croatia's government hopes to receive an invitation to join the alliance at a summit next week in Bucharest. Croatian officials say NATO entry is important for national security and economic prosperity in the former Yugoslav republic. Support for NATO membership in opinion polls was below 40 percent but it has risen in recent months to around 60 percent following fresh instability in the Balkan region prompted by Kosovo's declaration of independence. The NGOs, gathered in the Committee for Referendum on NATO, said it was not right to take such an important decision over Croatia's future as NATO entry without a referendum, which is not mandatory under the country's constitution. "We are neither for nor against NATO entry. But we think it is a strategic decision for Croatia's future and that is a reason good enough for citizens to be consulted," organisers' spokesman Aleksandar Hatzivelkos said. The initiative for a referendum will succeed if at least 10 percent of all eligible voters, or almost 450,000 people, sign up during the next 15 days. Croatia's foreign and defence ministers, Gordan Jandrokovic and Branko Vukelic, said on Friday they did not think a referendum was necessary because of the high levels of public support.
