<TITLE> Britain to name new Russia envoy on Friday: reports </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, March 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain will name its next ambassador to Russia on Friday, Russian news agencies quoted the current envoy as saying on Thursday, adding the replacement had nothing to do with the worsening of ties between the two states. "I am here until September this year," local agencies quoted Ambassador Tony Brenton as telling journalists. He rejected speculation that his replacement could have been prompted by the chilly relations between Moscow and London. "This is not true. I am leaving on schedule after spending four years in Russia." He said the name of the new ambassador would be announced at 1300 Moscow time (10 a.m. GMT) in London on Friday.
