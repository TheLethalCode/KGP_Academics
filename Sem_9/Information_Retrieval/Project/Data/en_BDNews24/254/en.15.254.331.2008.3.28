<TITLE> Iraq`s southern oil pipeline flow above normal </TITLE>

 Baghdad, March 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraq's southern oil pipeline system was flowing at above normal levels to the Basra export terminal on Friday after a bomb attack, an Iraqi oil official and shipping source said. "As of 10 p.m. (1900 GMT) last night, things are back to normal," the senior official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Saboteurs attacked the southern oil pipeline system on Thursday, briefly interrupting exports from the south of the country for the first time in years. The resulting blaze prompted the Southern Oil Company to shutdown the pipeline system, which usually pumps at least 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) to the Basra terminal, as a precaution, he said. "When the fire erupted, they didn't know which one was damaged and they had to shut all of them," the official said. "When they put the fire out, they discovered it was the smaller of the three." After the fire was extinguished on Thursday an investigation showed that a smaller, 28-inch pipeline, pumping about 100,000 barrels per day, was "severely damaged," said Ibrahim Wali, senior technician working on repairs at the pipeline. One of the two major pipelines, both located nearby and are more than 40 inches in diameter, had minor damage and was quickly repaired on Thursday, Wali said. ALTERNATIVE ROUTES Backup pipelines from southern oilfields have kept flow levels to the terminal near normal, he said. The technician said he expected the damaged 28-inch pipeline to be repaired later on Friday. A shipping source at the Basra terminal said the flow rate from the southern oil pipeline system early on Friday was 1.75 million bpd, up 550,000 bpd from the previous day and above the average daily rate. The pipelines are located about 7 km south of oil-rich Basra, where heavy clashes between Iraqi security forces and Mehdi Army militants have occurred this week. Iraq's government relies heavily on oil exports for revenue, and had managed to sustain the flow from Basra even as a violent insurgency targeted the country's oil installations elsewhere. In the north, persistent sabotage and technical problems had reduced exports to a trickle since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003, but flows have improved greatly since last summer.
