<TITLE> Kazakh leader's foe gets new sentence in absentia </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ALMATY, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Kazakh military court sentenced President Nursultan Nazarbayev's former son-in-law to 20 years in jail in absentia on Wednesday for planning a coup, the Prosecutor General's office said. The sentence, handed out after closed hearings, is the second for Rakhat Aliyev, once a powerful politician, businessman and media mogul and former ambassador to Austria. Aliyev lives in exile in Austria, where a court ruled last year against his extradition to Kazakhstan. The case against him has exposed tensions within Kazakhstan's elite. The military court in the central region of Akmola found Aliyev, along with former head of State Security Committee (SSC) Alnur Musayev and 14 other people, guilty of planning a coup since 1996, the Prosecutor General's office said in a statement. "The court has established that Aliyev and Musayev, aiming to fulfil their criminal plan of seizing power by force, trained a special operations group made up of gunmen loyal to them," it said. "The gunmen received training in Israel and Egypt that was paid for from Aliyev's personal funds." Aliyev and Musayev then appointed the men to work at the SSC, the president's guard and the financial police, the Prosecutor General's office said. It also said Aliyev had used a special forces unit of SSC as his personal henchmen. Aliyev's group had secretly imported and kept dozens of military cars, thousands of guns, various poisons and even radioactive materials, the statement said. Another Kazakh court earlier sentenced Aliyev to 20 years in prison on charges of kidnapping and running a criminal gang that extorted money and assets from local businessmen. Aliyev, 45, has denied all the charges, calling the cases politically motivated and linked to his presidential ambitions. Dariga Nazarbayeva, the eldest of Nazarbayev's three daughters, divorced Aliyev shortly after a criminal investigation was launched against him in May 2007. Aliyev has since accused Nazarbayev of seizing his Kazakh assets and usurping power. Nazarbayev, in power since 1989, keeps a tight grip on Kazakhstan's political life. Parliament has adopted constitutional changes allowing him to stay in power for an unlimited number of terms. Nazarbayev's party won all the seats in parliament in snap election last year.
