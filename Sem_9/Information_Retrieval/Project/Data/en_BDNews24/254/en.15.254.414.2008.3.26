 LONDON, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mortgage borrowers can still access competitive deals, despite the credit crunch, but brokers expect the situation to deteriorate this year, two surveys show. The difference in interest rates between loans for people who want to borrow 90 percent of their property value compared to 50 percent is just 0.04 percent on the top five-year deals and 0.19 percent on two-year products, according to online mortgage company mform.co.uk. Typical rates on five-year deals are 5.63 percent for 90 percent loan-to-value and 5.59 percent for 50 percent loan-to-value, and 5.39 percent and 5.2 percent on two-year deals respectively. Francis Ghiloni, mform.co.uk's marketing and business development director, said: "Mortgage customers are undoubtedly facing challenging times, but they are not as bleak as is being painted. "People coming off two, three and five-year fixed-rate deals will face higher monthly payments. However, they will have benefited from house price increases and that will have enabled them to build equity and to substantially improve their loan-to-value." The average homeowner has borrowed between 58 and 68 percent of the value of their property in the past three years, according to data from the Council of Mortgage Lenders. The fallout from the credit crunch and a slowing housing market have forced lenders to consider their position in the market and reassess their attitude to risk-based lending. That has seen them scrap cheap fixed-rate deals and 100 percent-plus loans, and tighten their lending criteria. The tough environment has hit thousands of mortgage borrowers, many of whom are facing "payment shock" when current mortgage deals expire. But Ghiloni added: "Panic about the UK heading for a worse house price crash than the U.S. is unhelpful and speculative. "Worse still, the doom-mongers' predictions could become a self-fulfilling prophecy: if borrowers become scared that prices will fall they will be less willing to invest and the fall will happen anyway." However, a separate poll showed that mortgage brokers expect the situation in the residential mortgage market to deteriorate during 2008. Some 85 percent of 100 brokers surveyed said many people would find it difficult to secure a mortgage during 2008, according to independent risk consultancy Protiviti. Around 79 percent said they expected lenders to widen the gap between their rates and the Bank of England base rate. Andrew Clinton, managing director of Protiviti's financial services industry practice, said: "Banks and building societies are, not surprisingly, reviewing their lending criteria and overhauling their risk management programmes in the light of the current market and economic situation, with the aim of reducing their exposure to bad debt. "In the past, there has been a focus on building the size of the mortgage book, however there is now naturally much more emphasis on the quality of the mortgage book and on the management of arrears and defaults, including policies towards customers in difficulty, or expected to get into difficulty, when their current favourable deals and fixed rates expire."
