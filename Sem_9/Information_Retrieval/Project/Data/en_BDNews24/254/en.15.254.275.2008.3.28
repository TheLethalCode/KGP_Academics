 Requinoa, Chile, March 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hundreds of farmers and farmhands protested in Chile's agricultural heartland on Thursday to demand authorities take measures to boost their profits in a sector hammered by the strengthening peso. Farmers say production costs have doubled in the past five years due to a nearly 45 percent appreciation of the peso against the U.S. dollar and sharp rises in fuel, labor and other expenses. Sector leaders and businessmen joined workers carrying placards and black flags in the farming town of Requinoa, 60 miles (100 km) south of the capital Santiago, vowing more demonstrations to press for government and central bank action. "We have seen a certain insensitivity on the part of the economic authorities," said Luis Schmidt, president of the National Agricultural Society union. "What we need is a political decision to face up to the issue." The orderly protest was held by a motorway. Two donkeys stood by the roadside, wearing banners that read "Finance Ministry" and "Central Bank." Exporters have appealed to the Central Bank, which is autonomous, to intervene in the foreign exchange market to weaken the peso to bring down their overheads like labor costs and to make their dollar revenues worth more in peso terms. Central Bank President Jose de Gregorio has warned the bank has not ruled out intervention and has warned currency speculators not to look for a bailout. But so far the bank has not intervened -- and has not done so for almost a decade. Chile's peso, which trades in a free-float exchange rate, is now worth about 443 to the dollar. The Finance Ministry has decreed measures to help exporters, such as simplifying taxes, but has deferred to the central bank on the issue of the currency. Chile, the world's top copper producer, has seen a boom in global commodities prices boost its trade surplus. Its main agricultural exports are fruit and farmed fish. RUNAWAY PESO Chile's peso has strengthened nearly 14 percent against the dollar so far this year to its highest levels in more than a decade on the back of strong copper prices and a widening gap between domestic and U.S. interest rates. Chile's central bank has raised its benchmark rate to 6.25 percent to control inflation. By contrast, the U.S. Federal Reserve slashed its benchmark federal funds rate last week by three-quarters of a point to 2.25 percent, the lowest since February 2005, to try to jump-start the weak U.S. economy and ease a mortgage crisis. "We share the need to be very alert to what happens with economic competitiveness and in particular the exchange rate," Finance Minister Andres Velasco said in Santiago, adding the government was considering new economic measures. Fuel prices, which have shot up amid a drought that has dried up reservoirs and hit hydroelectric power generation, are also hurting the farm sector. Union leader Schmidt said 45,000 farm workers were fired in 2006 and another 12,000 in 2007 due to falling profitability. The sector employs about 800,000 people on a permanent basis and 500,000 part time in the country of around 16 million people. "I came to support my company because, given the fall of the dollar, we risk our company being closed down and losing our jobs," said Maria Castillo, who works at a plant that exports lemons, cherries, pears and apples.
