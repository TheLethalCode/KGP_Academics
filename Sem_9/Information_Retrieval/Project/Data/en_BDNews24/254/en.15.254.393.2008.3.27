 BAGHDAD March 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tens of thousands of supporters of Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr marched in Baghdad on Thursday to protest against a crackdown on his followers and call for the end of the US-backed government. In Sadr City, the vast Shia slum named after Sadr's slain father, crowds of angry men jammed the main circle chanting and shouting anti-government slogans. Mass demonstrations were also held in the northern Kadhimiya and Shula districts. An Interior Ministry source said hundreds of thousands had taken to the streets, but this could not be independently confirmed. "We demand the downfall of the Maliki government. It does not represent the people. It represents Bush and Cheney," said Sadr City resident Hussein Abu Ali, referring to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. More than 100 people have been killed and hundreds wounded since the government launched a major military operation in the southern city of Basra on Tuesday targeting districts where Sadr's Mehdi Army militia has a strong presence. Clashes have split Iraq's majority Shia community, all but collapsing a ceasefire declared last August by Sadr. US military officials had credited the truce with helping to sharply reduce violence in the country. Authorities imposed curfews across southern Iraq to halt the spread of violence after security forces in launched the Basra operation, the largest military offensive by Iraqi forces independent of major support from U.S. or British combat units. The fighting exposes the deep divide within the Shi'ite community between the political parties in Maliki's government who have control over the security forces and Sadr's followers who in many Shi'ite areas rule the streets. Some analyst say Maliki's offensive also aims to weaken Sadr politically and strengthen rivals including the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council, ahead of provincial elections due by October. Saboteurs blew up one of Iraq's two main oil export pipelines from Basra, cutting off a third of the exports from the city which provides 80 percent of the government's revenue. U.S. oil prices rose more than $1 a barrel after the blast. A massive mortar bombardment struck the main riverside police base at Basra palace before noon on Thursday and heavy shooting broke out in a main commercial street in the city, Iraq's second largest, where the crackdown began on Tuesday. "The operation is still ongoing and will continue until Basra is free from criminals and outlaws," Major-General Abdul-Aziz Mohammed, head of operations at the Iraqi Ministry of Defence, told reporters in Baghdad. Reuters television pictures showed masked gunmen from Sadr's Mehdi Army militia in Basra wielding automatic rifles and grenade launchers and showing off vehicles they said they had captured from the government's forces during the fighting. "I call on Nuri al-Maliki and the Iraqi army to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Iraqi people and not hurt them. We in the Mehdi Army are your brothers," said a commander amid armed fighters dressed in black. "Do not try to ignite the situation. The number of people killed is mounting in Basra." Basra's police chief survived an assassination attempt overnight. A roadside bomb killed three of his bodyguards. An Interior Ministry source said 51 people have been killed and more than 200 wounded so far in Basra alone. CLASHES SPREAD Clashes have spread in the past two days to the southern cities of Kut, Hilla, Diwaniya, Amara and Kerbala, as well as several Shi'ite neighbourhoods of Baghdad. Abdul Hanin al-Imara, police chief in Wasit, a volatile southern province, said 44 people had been killed and 75 wounded there. U.S. warplanes hovered over the provincial capital Kut. "I couldn't reach my door. I saw from the window two gunmen lying in the street. One was saying to the other, 'be careful two of our guys have been killed!'" said Mohammed, a resident of the town's Halchiya district, reached by telephone. Shooting could be heard in the background. Sadr's aides say the ceasefire is still formally in place despite the fighting. But he has called on his followers to stage a campaign of "civil disobedience", forcing schools, universities and shops to shut, and threatened to declare a countrywide "civil revolt" if the crackdown is not halted. Ali Bustan, head of the health directorate for eastern Baghdad, said 30 bodies and more than 200 wounded had been brought to two hospitals in Sadr City, the vast Shi'ite slum named for Sadr's slain father and the cleric's main power base. "The Iraqi forces are not letting us use ambulances to carry the wounded out of Sadr City. Last night they fired on an ambulance and killed a wounded person and someone accompanying him," he said. "Many of the wounded are women and children." Sadr followers set fire to the headquarters of Maliki's Dawa party in the Shaab district of northern Baghdad, police said. Clashes broke out in the southeastern al-Amin district. A mortar strike killed at a Baghdad bus station killed three people and wounded 15 on Thursday. A strike near the US embassy sent a huge column of black smoke into the sky. Maliki, who has travelled to Basra to oversee the crackdown, has ordered militants to surrender within three days. He cancelled plans to attend an Arab summit in Syria on Saturday. US and British assistance for the campaign in the south has been limited to air support and small teams of mentors. There are few US troops in the Shia south and British troops pulled out of Basra in December. Sadr, a fiery anti-American preacher who twice led revolts against US forces in 2004, won US praise last year for helping curb violence by declaring a ceasefire. He helped install Maliki in power in 2006 but broke with him last ye
