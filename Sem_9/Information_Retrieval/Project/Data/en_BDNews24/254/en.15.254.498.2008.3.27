<TITLE> East Timor President tells of last moments before shooting </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Sydney, March 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - East Timor President Jose Ramos-Horta recalled on Thursday how he stared at a rebel soldier's face moments before he was shot, saying he only avoided being hit in the chest because he turned to run. Ramos-Horta, who is convalescing in the Australian city of Darwin after surgery for gunshot wounds he received in the February assassination bid, said he watched as a rebel soldier raised his rifle and fired at him from less than 10 metres. The president said he unwittingly walked into the ambush after speaking to a bank worker who told him international forces were exercising near his house. "He told me that he had seen international forces were exercising near my house. I was surprised, but because of that I was sure that there would be no problem, so I walked towards the house," Ramos-Horta told Australian Broadcasting Corp. television. "The gunman was hiding near my gate and he took aim at me and I was just lucky that as I stopped, I turned around to run and that is why he didn't hit me in the chest on the left side, but hit me on the leg on the right side," Ramos-Horta said. "I looked at his eyes, not friendly, he was determined to fire and that is why I turned," he said. Ramos-Horta said he lay bleeding on ground for 30 minutes, shouting for an ambulance. He said he lost about four litres of blood. "Luckily the Australian young men and women in the defence force in Timor gave me a lot of blood, so I was saved," he said. Rebel soldiers ambushed Ramos-Horta during an early morning walk on Feb. 11, and also attacked Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao. Ramos-Horta was shot several times in the attack in which rebel leader Alfredo Reinado was killed, while Gusmao escaped unharmed. Rebel soldiers blamed for the attacks have managed to escaped capture. He said that the rebels who tried to assassinate him could have been caught if international troops had immediately locked-down the capital Dili. "I think if Australian-led forces could have promptly surrounded the entire town, close all the exits...they would have captured them within hours, because for hours after the attack on my house they were still in the hills around my house," he said. But the president did not blame the Australian forces for allowing the rebels to escape. "No, the Australians troops only act upon request from the United Nations," he said. Ramos-Horta said he hoped to return to Timor next month. "I am physically, mentally very well. I still have pains related to the wounds and surgery, but they are bearable," he said. Ramos-Horta was seated during the interview, wearing a white shirt and speaking strongly -- unlike an earlier media appearance earlier in March when he looked frail as he thanked Australian doctors for saving his life. He said he was hopeful Timor would remain peaceful. "I think a lesson has been drawn from this, that we must clearly step back from violence. I can not guarantee that there will be no further violence in the country, but the vast majority of people in the country are more shocked than before." East Timor, Asia's youngest nation has been unable to achieve stability since its hard-won independence from Indonesia in 2002. The army tore apart along regional lines in 2006, when about 600 soldiers were sacked, triggering factional violence that killed 37 people and drove 150,000 from their homes. Foreign troops were sent to restore order in the former Portuguese colony of about one million.
