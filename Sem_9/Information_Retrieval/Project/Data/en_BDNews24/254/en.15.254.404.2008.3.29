<TITLE> Deadly blast in south Afghanistan </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 kabul, March 29 (bdnews24.com/BBC) A bomb explosion near a power plant in southern Afghanistan has killed two employees, police say. Helmand police chief Mohammad Hussein Andiwal said six people had been hurt in the blast in the Gereshk district of the troubled province. He told AFP news agency that the remote-controlled device was apparently hidden near the wall of the plant. Nato and government troops in Afghanistan have been battling a resurgent Taleban militia. Mr Andiwal said the plant's power supply had not been interrupted. Helmand is a hotbed of Taleban activity. Thousands of British troops there clash daily with Taleban insurgents and it grows half the country's opium poppies. It also has a new governor, Gulab Mangal, who has vowed to persuade Taleban fighters to change sides. A recent UN report on Afghan violence said there were 8,000 conflict-related deaths in 2007 - a fifth of which were civilians.
