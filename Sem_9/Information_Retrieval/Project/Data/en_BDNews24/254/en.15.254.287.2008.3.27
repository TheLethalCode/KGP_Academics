 MADRID, March 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Although Spain have beaten world champions Italy and World Cup finalists France during their preparations for Euro 2008 question marks remain over the style of play and tactics adopted by Luis Aragones's side. A spectacular volley by striker David Villa earned a 1-0 victory over Italy in Elche on Wednesday but the failure of a side brimming with creative talent to create more chances has become a cause for serious concern. "A great goal from Villa and a lot of doubts," was Marca's match report headline. "The current system is short on attacking power and light in defence... The team isn't outstanding in any area, not even in the creativity of its midfield," it added. After experimenting with a traditional 4-4-2 formation and a more attacking 4-3-3 lineup, Aragones has now settled on using a holding midfielder alongside four others renowned for their skill and touch with a lone striker up front. The logic behind the formation is that Spain will monopolise possession and eventually wear down opponents with their customary patient, short-passing game. The reality is midfielders Cesc Fabregas, Andres Iniesta and Xavi are getting in each other's way while the striker, Fernando Torres or Valencia's Villa, has to live off scraps. MIDFIELD CRAMPED Torres and Fabregas have been the toast of the English Premier League this season for their brilliant performances with their clubs but the pair fail to shine when they play for Spain. At Arsenal, Fabregas is given the freedom to run the show in midfield while for Spain he his cramped by Xavi and Iniesta and has little room for manoeuvre. At Liverpool, Torres relies on quick balls so he has room to run at defences but Spain spend so much time elaborating their attacks that he is closed down as soon as he receives a pass. Fabregas resisted the temptation to voice concerns about the problems he has fitting into the pattern adopted by Spain but his comments about Arsenal made it clear what he thinks. "At Arsenal it is true that all the attacks come through me," Fabregas told radio station Onda Cero after the match. "I feel as though I am a fundamental part of the plans at Arsenal and that's important to me. I love it and hope I that it shows by the way I'm playing." As usual Spain head into a major championships with an impressive unbeaten run but to cast off their tag as perennial underperformers they may need to think about changing their tactics before Euro 2008 kicks off in June. "If it was just down to friendlies we'd be world champions," said Fabregas when asked about Spain's prospects at the month-long finals in Austria and Switzerlan
