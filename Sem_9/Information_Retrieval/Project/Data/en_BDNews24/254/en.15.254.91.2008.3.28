<TITLE> Europe corp bond issuance plummets in Q1: Thomson </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, March 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - After the worst start for European corporate bond issuance this decade, analysts are hoping that a spurt of new deals in the past week will kick-start the primary market in the second quarter. European corporate bond activity totalled just $30.3 billion from 71 issues in the first quarter of this year, down 53 percent from the $65 billion raised from 130 issues in the same period a year ago, according to preliminary data from Thomson Financial published on Friday. The issuance is the slowest on record for the period 2000-2008, Thomson said. But with a strong rally in credit spreads luring a raft of companies to the debt markets this week -- including benchmark deals from Dutch telecoms company KPN, French retailer Casino and UK drinks group Diageo -- confidence is gaining that the tide may have already turned. Only the KPN and Casino deals were included in the Thomson figures. "Is it the start of a recovery? I hope so," said Sarwat Faruqui, head of corporate syndicate at Citigroup. Citi was one of the lead managers for Greek telecoms group OTE's 2.1 billion euro ($3.3 billion) 2-part bond deal launched in February. That was the biggest corporate bond from a European borrower so far this year, according to Thomson data. "The KPN and Casino deals will give some comfort to the market. There are plenty of taps being done and I continue to get colour from accounts that they would like to buy high quality assets in euros," said Faruqui. KPN raised 850 million euros through a 7-year euro bond while Casino, rated at the lowest investment grade notch by both Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings, saw orders of about 1.5 billion euros for its 5-year 650 million issue. Other European borrowers to feature so far this year include British America Tobacco, HeidelbergCement and drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline. There is also a pipeline building, which should help bolster sentiment further, with a possible deal from Dutch publisher Wolters Kluwer coming after a planned European roadshow next week. SLOW RECOVERY Nonetheless, it will probably take some months yet before new supply gets back to levels considered anywhere near normal. "We do not expect a huge amount of issuance if the markets continue to display such a volatile and uncertain dynamic," said Suki Mann, a credit strategist at SG CIB, who forecasts corporate euro bond issuance of 110 billion euros ($174 billion) this year. That is more than $50 billion short of the $229 billion raised last year -- $82.8 billion of which came in the second quarter -- and $258 billion in 2006, which was the highest in at least six years, Thomson data shows. "If markets settle, the supply will pick up, but we could still expect a light second quarter versus the equivalent period in previous years," Mann said. Faruqui at Citi said borrowers remained reluctant throughout the first quarter to pay higher spreads to get deals done. That may well change now that a number of corporates -- some offering covenants to get issues printed -- have wrapped issues up. "A situation that would be truly bad for confidence is one where borrowers wanted to get deals printed but couldn't. But it's a completely different ball game if borrowers don't want to print because spreads are too high," she said. "For much of Q1 we have very much been in the latter situation. It's not that there isn't a trade to do, it's a question of price and borrowers not wanting to pay it. And no one wants to be the first to do anything, whether you're an investor or an issuer." As for high yield, the wait may be a bit longer, with the last such deal from power company Intergen last July. British oil rig builder and operator Abbot Group is expected to launch a high yield bond in the coming months however. RANKINGS In terms of bank rankings for European deals, there were also some significant changes. Among them, Citi dropped to tenth from third place in the same period a year ago, Barclays Capital jumped to second from fourth place and RBS moved down to third from second place. Deutsche Bank retained the top spot, managing $35 billion worth of deals. JP Morgan swapped places with Citi globally, switching from third to first place with $90.4 billion worth of deals while Deutsche Bank held onto second place.
