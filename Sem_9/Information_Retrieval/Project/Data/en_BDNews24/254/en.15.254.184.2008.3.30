 LONDON, March 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Investors' twin obsessions of US economic decline and money market liquidity will both get an airing this week as the first quarter begins with key data and a test of central banks' effectiveness. At the same time, a new concern is rising on equity markets about whether expectations for corporate earnings have fully taken into consideration the possibility of a severe global economic slowdown. First, the US economy, which depending on the view is either teetering on the brink of recession or already in one. US monthly jobs figures, due at the end of the week, are always carefully studied for what they say about growth. This time, however, investors will be particularly sensitive to them because of a growing concern that the US consumer is being to feel pain. "The consumer has been the last shoe to drop. Consumer spending has held up reasonably well," said Sarah Hewin, senior economist at American Express Bank. "(But) a further deterioration in jobless data combined with the very sharp fall in consumer confidence ... suggests that the consumer is going to pull back," she said. The Conference Board said last week that U.S. consumer confidence had hit a five-year low with fears growing over job prospects. The issue for investors is whether this growing angst will stop consumers spending, pushing the US economy deeper into trouble and spilling over into other economies, particularly those that are dependent on exports. Such a shift would add huge new pressures to global markets already reeling from the US slowdown and the stress in the financial sector from the subprime mortage crisis. The quarter that ends on Monday is set to be the worst for global stocks since the third quarter of 2002 when investors were seeing the end of the sell-off from the bursting of the internet stock bubble. It is also likely to be one of the seventh or eighth worst performing quarters in the last 20 years. Other data likely to weigh during the week include manufacturing and services reports for the United States and euro zone. FREE FLOW Investors' second focus during the week is likely to be on liquidity, which has been drying up on and off over the past nine months. The European Central Bank and its British and Swiss counterparts took steps last week to combat banks' unwillingness to lend cash ahead of the end of the quarter. Interbank lending rates, which govern the flow of money within the financial system, were shooting up as the quarterly closing of books approached. How successful the central bankers were and what happens to interbank rates after the second quarter begins will be crucial for the sector that underpins much of what goes on in global financial markets. There was, meanwhile, some relief last week that demand by Wall Street firms to swap dodgy mortgage securities for low-risk Treasuries was only tepid, suggesting to some that credit tightness, while still prevalent, may not be as acute as feared. Central banks, particularly the U.S. Federal Reserve, have been taking a series of steps to get money and confidence back into markets. The question is whether the efforts will work. Economists at investment bank UBS reckon the Fed has done enough to address immediate risk, but that more is needed for the longer term. "The underlying sources of economic and financial malaise -- insufficient capital in the U.S. housing market and financial system -- remain unaddressed," they said in a note that eschewed a move now into equities in favour of government bonds. EARNINGS DENIAL? One new concern that has risen for investors, meanwhile, is whether the price of all these economic and financial woes has been properly factored into the corporate earnings expectations stocks are currently trading on. Societe Generale, for example, estimates that on a quarterly basis, cuts in earnings forecasts of 5 percent or more are normal during an economic slowdown. First quarter cuts, however, amount to only about 3.5 percent. "The rate of downgrades is often twice that," said Andrew Lapthorne, a quant strategist at the French investment bank. Most of the cuts, moreover, have only come in specific sectors -- financial and semiconductor stocks. This suggests that despite the falls that have already been seen on equity markets, analysts may not have factored in the kind of broad impact on earnings that would occur if glum US consumers pushed the world into a deep economic decline. Dutch bank ABN Amro calls this "earnings denial". Underlining how a declining US economy could spread its woes, it reckons a sharp deterioration in the US economy, cost pressures and the appreciation of the euro -- up around 8 percent against the dollar in the quarter -- point to "substantial" future downgrades. All this would argue for yet more pressure on equities ahead along with continued volatility in fixed income, currencies and commoditi
