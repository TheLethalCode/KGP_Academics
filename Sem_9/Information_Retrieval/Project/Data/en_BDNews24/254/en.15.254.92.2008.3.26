<TITLE> Nigeria's oil-fuelled investment allure eclipses Kenya </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, March 26 (Reuters) - Disputed elections, political violence and fraying infrastructure may have sent investors scurrying from Kenya but they appear to have done little to curb enthusiasm for investment in Nigeria. Borne by the high price of oil and other commodities, Nigeria has eclipsed Kenya to be seen as one of the most promising African economies, attracting investors keen on less-developed "frontier markets" that have lower correlation to the brewing crisis on global financial markets. And while investors are leery of banking shares elsewhere in the world, Nigerian banks have become stock market darlings thanks to consolidation spurred by financial-sector reforms. "It's the most populous nation in Africa so it has the scale to be of interest. The problem with a lot of African economies is that they are so small that lack of liquidity is a big drawback," said Razia Khan, Standard Chartered's regional research head for Africa. "But just in terms of size, Nigeria is Africa's equivalent of a China or India." With oil accounting for about 92 percent of its exports, Nigeria is seen to be more resilient to a U.S. recession and better placed to meet China's ravenous appetite for commodities. Africa's top oil exporter and the world's eighth, attracted $10.3 billion in direct and portfolio investment last year. Despite a looming global recession, that amount is expected to rise this year to $11 billion and the Nigerian economy is set to expand 9 percent, according to the International Monetary Fund. Investors appear little fazed by ongoing legal attempts by opposition politicians in Nigeria to unseat President Umaru Yar'Adua who won the office last April in a disputed election. "For emerging market investors, Nigeria is a good proxy for exposure to global commodities," said Graham Stock, executive director at JPMorgan's Emerging Markets Research in London. RESILIENCE AND RISKS Nigeria's move in 2006 to settle its multi-billion dollar debt with the Paris Club paved the way for the country to build up a healthy current account surplus. The country's fiscal stability has helped ease investor fears despite oil production in the Niger Delta being chronically hit by armed attacks by militant groups, kidnappings and labour unrest. In the last two years more than 200 foreigners have been kidnapped and dozens of oil production facilities blown up. This is in marked contrast with the capital flight from resource-poor and tourism-reliant Kenya, following the eruption of ethnic violence there after a disputed presidential election in December that claimed at least 1,200 lives. "Political risk in Nigeria is something investors can comprehend but Kenya was supposed to be an economy that everyone knew inside out," Standard Chartered's Khan said. Until the recent trouble in Kenya, the country was seen as one of the most promising economies in an often volatile continent. In Nigeria, the recent election of Delta native Goodluck Jonathan as vice-president could brighten prospects of a resolution in the restive, oil-rich south but tensions could also flare because of treason charges brought against arrested rebel leader Henry Okah. BANKS AND PITFALLS Nigeria's country's stock market capitalisation has swelled fourfold since 2005, driven in part by investor interest in banks such as Guarantee Trust Bank, Zenith Bank and First Bank of Nigeria. Critics say Nigerian bank valuations are already stretched, with lenders trading at five to seven times book value, compared to global peers who trade at two to three times. Standard & Poor's this week rated Nigeria's banking system "high risk" despite its recent boom, citing the country's weak judiciary, unstable politics and poor corporate governance. Investors are now focused on Nigerian insurers Cornerstone and Crusader Insurance, which are expected to benefit from the next phase of financial sector reforms. Andrew Brown, a fund manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, prefers buying into South African firms such as retailer Massmart and gas group African Oxygen which are expanding regionally to play off the Nigerian growth story. "This negates the corporate governance risk of investing in Nigerian companies. South Africa remains a couple of decades ahead of most of sub-Sahara Africa in terms of corporate law and governance," Brown said. Nigeria's failure so far to develop infrastructure to nurture its non-oil industries also leaves its reserves vulnerable to a sudden fall in commodity prices, some investors said. "Corruption is a source of concern. Actual state spending on infrastructure has not really taken off," said Stephane Bwakira, who manages Standard Bank's over $270 million Africa Equity Fund, now about 25 percent invested in Nigeria. "Nigeria's dependency on oil was a problem in the 1980s and 1990s, and it could be again if oil prices slump."
