 CHENNAI, India, March 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian batsman Sachin Tendulkar is nursing a groin injury but should be fit for the second test against South Africa starting on Thursday, captain Anil Kumble said. The player did not take the field on the final day of the first test which ended in a draw on Sunday. Kumble said he was hopeful Tendulkar would recover in time. "Sachin picked up a slight groin strain that got a bit aggravated," Kumble told reporters. "He also got a tummy upset. We are hopeful that he should be okay." Tendulkar had declared himself fit before the series when many of his team mates were directed to report to the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore to undergo fitness tests. Kumble was also off the field in the final two sessions. "I had a slight niggle while I was bowling and I didn't want to take a chance," he said. "The match was probably over by then. "It was important for me to ensure that I recover well for the second test." The second test will be played in Ahmedabad
