<TEXT>
 LONDON, March 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy, whose turbulent love life has been the target of much press scorn, said on Thursday he was very moved by the reception his new wife Carla was given in Britain. Sarkozy saw his popularity plummet in France during his whirlwind public romance with the former model. Voters punished him in local elections, complaining he was too wrapped up in his love life and not concentrating enough on France's economic woes. But the British and French press were united in praise of Carla's elegant debut at Windsor Castle where Queen Elizabeth hosted the couple at a sumptuous state banquet. Britain's Daily Telegraph asked "Is Carla the new (Princess) Diana?" French newspapers enthused over the sensation she caused. Sarkozy said: "I was very moved by the reception Carla received." "I think it was well deserved. There have been so many things. I am very happy to see that justice was done to her," he told reporters in a joint news conference with Britain's prime minister, Gordon Brown. Sarkozy, 53, separated from his second wife Cecilia last October following an 11-year marriage and just five months after winning power. By February he was married to the 40-year-old model-turned singer Carla Bruni. Sarkozy, who had been nicknamed "President Bling-Bling" for his flash lifestyle bedecked in Ray-Ban sunglasses and Rolex watch, was clearly overjoyed by the public relations coup. "Everyone has seen that she is a woman with convictions, sensitivity and humanity and it's her convictions, this sensitivity, this humanity which make up Carla's elegance," he said. Brown and Sarkozy sought to outdo each other in gushing praise -- a far cry from testy Anglo-French relations in the past. Sarkozy called Brown "one of the best finance ministers Europe has known" for his role before becoming prime minister. Brown, hailing what he hopes will be a sea change in relations between two countries, welcomed what he called the "entente formidable".
