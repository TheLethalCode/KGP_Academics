 LONDON, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A man charged with the kidnap and false imprisonment of schoolgirl Shannon Matthews will go on trial later this year, a judge said on Wednesday. Michael Donovan, 39, from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, is due to stand trial at Leeds Crown Court on Nov. 11. He appeared before the court via a videolink from Armley prison in Leeds. The Recorder of Leeds judge Peter Collier remanded him in custody. Another hearing is due to take place on July 11. Donovan was arrested on March 14 after police raided a house in Batley Carr, West Yorkshire, and found the missing nine-year-old. She disappeared on Feb. 19, prompting one of the biggest police inquiries in the area since the Yorkshire Ripper investigation of the 1970s. The schoolgirl remains in police care while detectives try to establish exactly what happened to her. In a statement released earlier this month, her mother Karen Matthews said: "I fully understand that the police need to keep speaking to Shannon. I appreciate that could take some time and is not something that is going to happen overnight."
