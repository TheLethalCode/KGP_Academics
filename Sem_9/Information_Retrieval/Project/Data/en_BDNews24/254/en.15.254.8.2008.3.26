 PORT HARCOURT, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gunmen in Nigeria have kidnapped the wife and 3-week old baby of a local politician in the oil-producing Niger Delta, Nigerian media and a private security source said on Wednesday. The attackers broke into the home of Samuel Ejiogu, a candidate for the ruling People's Democratic Party in upcoming local elections, late on Tuesday and initially demanded 20 million naira ($150,700) for his family's release. "They called back to say that the new amount being asked for is 5 million naira but I still told them that I cannot afford such money, that I am not a rich man," Ejiogu was quoted as saying by the Website of the Vanguard daily newspaper. A private security contractor working in the oil industry confirmed the kidnapping but local authorities could not immediately be reached. Kidnappings for ransom are common in the Niger Delta, which is home to Africa's biggest oil industry but has suffered neglect and pollution during five decades of oil extraction. More than 200 foreigners, mostly working in the oil industry, have been kidnapped in the Niger Delta since early 2006, although since late last year most of those abducted have been Nigerian. Ejiogu is a candidate in local council elections on Saturday.
