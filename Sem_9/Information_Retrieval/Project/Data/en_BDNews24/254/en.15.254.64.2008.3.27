 MEXICO CITY, March 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - About 200 soldiers and police engaged in a five-hour battle with gunmen in northern Mexico on Wednesday, killing two suspected hitmen amid rising violence in Mexico's war on drug traffickers. After receiving a tip, police and troops circled a heavily armed group of gunmen in 12 SUVs near the sleepy town of Imuris, in Sonora state near Arizona, local officials said. At least one policeman was wounded in the shootout. Most of the gunmen escaped. "They are still looking for them with helicopters," Imuris Mayor Carlos Gallego told Reuters. About 20 to 30 men were in the group and at least one was arrested, Mexican media said. Gun battles between state security forces and cartel hitmen have escalated since President Felipe Calderon launched his campaign to crush drug gangs after taking office in December 2006, sending thousands of troops across the country. Twenty-two people were killed in May 2007 during a fierce shootout in Sonora. Some 720 people have died this year in drug killings and more than 2,500 were murdered in 2007. Most of the violence is linked to a turf war sparked by Mexico's most wanted man, Joaquin "Shorty" Guzman, who heads an alliance of drug gangs from the Pacific state of Sinaloa and who is trying to dominate the narcotics business in Mexico
