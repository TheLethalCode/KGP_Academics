<TITLE> St Modwen sees slower NAV growth in uncertain market </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, March 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British property firm St Modwen Properties said on Friday it expected net asset value growth to slow this year amid uncertain market conditions and a marked deterioration in macro-economic signals. In an interim statement covering the period from Dec. 1 to date, the regeneration specialist said it was beginning to benefit from lower construction prices and it still saw resilient occupier demand for smaller office and industrial properties. "Our overall view remains that our marshalling and development programme will enable us to see growth in the company's net asset value in 2008, albeit at a lower level than in recent past," said Chairman Anthony Glossop. While more cautious in pursuing new development projects, St Modwen said it was pushing ahead with its existing, partly-speculative development pipeline which included a 222,000 square feet distribution hub in Gloucester, southwestern England and a 175,000 square feet business space scheme in Stoke-on-Trent, central England. The company also said it had secured fresh banking facilities, increasing its undrawn committed financial resources to 224 million pounds.
