<TITLE> Dutch say ready to be "creative" on Serb-EU ties </TITLE>

 BRDO, Slovenia, March 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Dutch foreign minister pledged on Saturday his country would be "creative" in seeking ways to support Serbian reformists but insisted Belgrade must cooperate fully with the U.N. war crimes tribunal before the EU signs a deal on closer ties. Maxime Verhagen vowed last December to block the signing of an EU-Serbia stabilisation and association (SAA) pact unless Bosnian Serb wartime general Ratko Mladic was on a plane to the Hague-based tribunal to face genocide charges. In a change to that formulation, he told reporters after a meeting with EU counterparts that handing over Mladic would be "the best proof" that Belgrade was cooperating but acknowledged it could not do that if he was not in the country. "I told my colleagues I am prepared to think creatively about ways to support the pro-European forces in Serbia but I told them that the conditions ... are not negotiable," Verhagen, whose country has resisted with Belgium a softening of the EU line. Verhagen said U.N. war crimes prosecutor Serge Brammertz and the EU would decide what constituted full cooperation, adding: "In this respect the best proof is for example the situation where Mladic is on the plane to the Hague. ... unless of course for example Mladic is not living in Serbia so that the Serbian government are doing their utmost but are not able to send him." Earlier, Serb Foreign Minister Vuc Jeremic, an ally of pro-European President Boris Tadic, pleaded with EU counterparts to agree to sign the SAA agreement before a May 11 election, which he said nationalists might otherwise win, diplomats said. They said Verhagen and his Belgian colleague came under strong pressure from their EU colleagues to back down, and Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn said the Dutch had indicated the political will to move.
