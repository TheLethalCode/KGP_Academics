 LONDON, March 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's top share index traded flat by midday on Friday, as Enterprise Inns surged on hopes of becoming a low-tax real estate investment trust, but banks offset gains after the sector was battered on Wall Street. By 1148 GMT the FTSE 100 was down 4.8 points or 0.1 percent at 5,712.4. The index has shed more than 11 percent so far this year due to investors' concerns over a likely U.S. recession and as credit markets appeared to have worsened. "It doesn't seem to have much energy or momentum to push higher," Neil Parker, a strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland said of the market. "We could be going back lower again.

Shares in British Airways fell 3.2 percent after chaos at the opening of its new Terminal 5 at London's Heathrow airport led it to cancel a fifth of scheduled departures there, and amid jitters ahead of Sunday's start of the "open skies" deal to create greater competition on trans-Atlantic routes. Food company Dairy Crest Group fell 5.7 percent after it warned about a rise in raw material costs and said unprecedented milk price increases meant it would make a loss on one supply contract. Investor attention will shift to core inflation data from the United States due at 1230 GMT that could provide evidence of the Federal Reserve's scope to continue to lower interest rates to boost economic growth. British house prices fell for a fifth straight month in March, bringing the annual rate of increase to its lowest in 12 years, in a clear sign the once red-hot property market is weakening fa
