<TITLE> France's Trezeguet left on his own against England </TITLE>

 PARIS, March 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Striker David Trezeguet's chances of securing a place in France's Euro 2008 squad were damaged on Wednesday after his team mates failed to provide him with any service during the 1-0 friendly win over England. The game at the Stade de France was the last before coach Raymond Domenech unveils his 23-man squad for June's finals in Austria and Switzerland but Trezeguet, who has a lot to prove, failed to make any impression on a dull match. "His life with Les Bleus looks like his 'wilderness years' in a team that seem to ignore him," said sports daily L'Equipe. "We cannot write that his team mates deliberately forgot him on the pitch. But it looked so much like they did." The Juventus striker only received five passes in the first half, most in his own half, with midfielders Florent Malouda and Franck Ribery unable to get the ball to him more often. The Chelsea winger and the Bayern Munich midfielder had more luck finding striker Nicolas Anelka who produced a much more convincing performance and forced England goalkeeper David James to concede a penalty just after the half-hour mark. Trezeguet, who is impressive in the air, would probably be happier playing alongside England centurion David Beckham. He clearly missed right back Willy Sagnol, who seems to be one the few French players able to provide decent crosses. Jerome Rothen could be the answer, with his ability to deliver accurate centres, but the Paris St Germain winger played for the France B team in Tuesday's 3-2 win over Mali. Without any support Trezeguet, recalled to the squad for the first time since the 1-0 home defeat by Scotland in a Euro 2008 qualifier last September because of an injury to Olympique Lyon's Karim Benzema, was left on his own up front. Trezeguet has scored 112 goals in 179 Serie A matches with Juventus and has 34 from 71 caps with France, including the Euro 2000 golden goal against Italy in the final. OVATION The 30-year-old, who now is only an outside bet to be included in the squad for Euro 2008, put on a brave face despite being a peripheral figure in an efficient France win. "We are happy with this victory..." he said. "When we attacked it was a bit strange because maybe we didn't bring the ball forward quickly enough and we somehow failed with the last pass. But the most important thing was to win this game." Trezeguet was given a warm ovation by the crowd when he was replaced by Lyon forward Sidney Govou after 64 minutes. By contrast, Olympique Marseille's Djibril Cisse, who is competing with the Juventus striker for a place in the Euro 2008 squad, was booed when he replaced Anelka 10 minutes from time. Trezeguet said: "I was very proud of the ovation when I was replaced, it was touching. The fans and myself have had a long relationship, they know that I always give it all when I play with the France shirt. This ovation helps me a lot." Ominously, though, Domenech added: "I don't listen to it (the crowd's reactions) anymore
