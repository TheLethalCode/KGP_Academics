 Dhaka, March 29 (bdnews24.com)  Asian Football Federation (AFC) president Mohamed Bin Hammam Saturday unveiled the foundation stone of the artificial football turf under the FIFA goal project-2. The turf would benefit football in Bangladesh, said Hammam in his welcome speech before unveiling the foundation adjacent to the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) House. The AFC boss was given a red-carpet reception with the artists of Spandan Shilpo Ghosti dancing to songs and kids, split into two groups of AFC eleven and FIFA eleven, displayed a brief game in front of BFF House. "After having met with the National Sports Council chairman and army chief General Moeen U Ahmed, I am very pleased to see his great interest in football and I have promised to provide him all assistance of the AFC and the FIFA in a bid to develop Bangladesh football," said Hammam, who is also chairman of the FIFA Goal Bureau. He also hoped that all related to football would put their hands together to take football ahead, and urged all to be united in the greater interest of developing football. Hammam also said that he had promised to the NSC chief to bring the FIFA president to Bangladesh to inaugurate the artificial turf. It will take US$ 4,00,000 to lay the turf with the FIFA providing the whole amount and supervising the work. Later, at a press conference he expressed happiness and hoped Bangladesh's football would go forward. "I am very much glad to visit here again and impressed to see the disciplines, also required to develop steady football in Bangladesh," said Hammam. "We are dreaming of improving Asian football, not exactly according to the European standard, but we want to see competitive matches among us," said Hamman hoping that some top footballers would come out from Asia in world football. The AFC boss said that the professional football league should not be ignored because it was the way to develop football in Asia, and Bangladesh football should get supports from all stakeholders, people, Olympics and government. Replying to a query, Hammam said, "It has been applicable for India and I think the new statute is also applicable for Bangladesh." Hammam said that the changed statues of the BFF would bring stability as the previous one was not able to do so and people would see different football in five to six years. He, however, emphasised development of the club and youth-level football. Asked why Bangladesh were demoted to the AFC Challenge Cup despite playing the AFC Cup directly the first time, the AFC boss said that all nations playing in Bangladesh lodged complaints against facilities and the ground, so Bangladesh were demoted to the AFC Challenge Cup considering their economic state and facilities. Meanwhile, AFC general secretary Dato Paul Moni and BFF president SA Sultan earlier in the day laid the foundation of the football center-cum-cyclone center in Barisal under a US$ 2,50,000 Tsunami fund.
