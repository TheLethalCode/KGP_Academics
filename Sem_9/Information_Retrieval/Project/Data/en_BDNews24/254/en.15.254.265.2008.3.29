 SYDNEY, March 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia are hoping for a record medal haul from their swim team at this year's Beijing Olympics after picking a 42-member squad overflowing with talent. Australia's best result in swimming was at the 2000 Sydney Olympics when they collected 18 medals but officials believe they could eclipse that mark in China after breaking eight world records at this week's trials. "Congratulations to the swimmers on their tremendous standard and depth," Australian Olympic Committee president John Coates told a news conference on Saturday. "Swimming no doubt will be our strongest section and will deliver for us at the Games." The powerful squad is made up of 22 women and 20 men and includes a mixture of seasoned campaigners and newcomers who have just burst on to the scene. Grant Hackett, Adam Pine, Ashley Callus and Leisel Jones will be appearing at their third Olympics, while 12 will be competing at their second and the other 26 at their first. Pine, aged 32 and a father of two children, is the oldest member while 15-year-old Brisbane schoolgirls Emily Seebohm and Cate Campbell are the youngest. The team contains six swimmers who hold world records in individual Olympic events - Eamon Sullivan (50 freestyle), Hackett (1500 freestyle), Libby Trickett (50 and 100 freestyle), Jones (100 and 200 breaststroke), Jessicah Schipper (200 butterfly) and Stephanie Rice (200 and 400 individual medley). GREAT PERFORMANCES Sullivan, Trickett and Rice all set their world records in the past week while Seebohm and Sophie Edington both broke the 50 backstroke record and although that is not an Olympic event, they both qualified for Beijing in the 100 backstroke. Hackett, who is bidding to become the first male swimmer to win the same individual event at three Olympics after success in the 1500 in Sydney and Athens, said it was the best Australian team he had been involved with in his long international career despite the retirement of Ian Thorpe. "I have never seen a trials like this, this is my 12th year doing this and we've had great performances in the past," he told reporters. "To see so many performances from so many different people that has been the incredible thing. And it's not only the world records that have been phenomenal but it's the depth." Head coach Alan Thompson agreed the results from the trials were impressive but warned the swimmers not to get carried away because the competition at Beijing would be much harder. "How good we are will be decided from 8 August (when the Olympics start). The next several weeks are a paramount," he said. "I am pleased and happy but satisfaction won't come until the Games." Australia squad: Men - Grant Brits, Leith Brodie, Ashley Callus, Nick D'Arcy, Ashley Delaney, Nicholas Ffrost, Grant Hackett, Andrew Lauterstein, Kenrick Monk, Patrick Murphy, Travis Nederpelt, Kirk Palmer, Adam Pine, Brenton Rickard, Christian Sprenger, Nic Sprenger, Craig Stevens, Hayden Stoeckel, Eamon Sullivan, Matt Targett. Women - Angie Bainbridge, Bronte Barratt, Cate Campbell, Alicia Coutts, Lara Davenport, Sophie Edington, Sally Foster, Felicity Galvez, Samantha Hamill, Belinda Hocking, Leisel Jones, Linda MacKenzie, Alice Mills, Meagen Nay, Kylie Palmer, Shayne Reese, Stephanie Rice, Jessicah Schipper, Melanie Schlanger, Emily Seebohm, Libby Trickett, Tarnee White
