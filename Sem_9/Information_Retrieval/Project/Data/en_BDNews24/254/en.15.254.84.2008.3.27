 March 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Arab leaders gather in Damascus on March 29-30 for an annual summit facing an array of Middle East conflicts. LEBANON CRISIS The Beirut governing coalition, which is backed by countries including the United States and Saudi Arabia, has been locked in a power struggle since November 2006 with an opposition alliance backed by Syria and led by Hezbollah -- a group also sponsored by Iran. The conflict is at the heart of a deep rift between Damascus and Riyadh and the reason that Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah decided to stay away from the Syria summit. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak -- like King Abdullah a close ally of the United States -- will also not attend because of the Lebanon crisis. Both Arab diplomatic heavyweights, Egypt and Saudi Arabia are sending lower level representation. The conflict in Lebanon, a country with a sectarian political system, pits Sunni and Druze leaders close to Saudi Arabia and the United States against an opposition dominated by Shia factions. The country's main Christian leaders are split between the camps. The government has been paralysed by the crisis and the country has been without a president since November 2007. The main point of dispute is an opposition demand for effective veto power in cabinet. The governing coalition has rejected the demand. Followers of rival leaders have clashed in the worst bouts of civil strife since the 1975-90 civil war. ARAB-ISRAELI CONFLICT Egypt made peace with Israel in 1979 and Jordan in 1994 in bilateral deals sponsored by the United States. But the decades-long Arab-Israeli conflict continues between the Jewish state and Syria and the Palestinians. Arab leaders launched a peace initiative in 2002 offering Israel normal ties in return for land captured in the 1967 war and the creation of a Palestinian state. The Arab initiative was endorsed again at last year's Arab summit in Riyadh. But Israel objects to central points, including a return to 1967 borders, the inclusion of Arab East Jerusalem in a Palestinian state and the return of Palestinian refugees to what is now Israel. The United States launched peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel in November with the aim of an agreement on Palestinian statehood by the time President George W Bush leaves office in January. But the talks have shown few signs of progress and have been slowed by disputes over Jewish settlement building and an Israeli offensive in the Gaza Strip. There have been no recent public moves towards peace talks between Syria and Israel. Damascus wants the return of the Golan Heights -- a strategic plateau seized by Israel in the 1967 war. HAMAS-FATAH CONFLICT Tension between Fatah and Hamas, the two main Palestinian factions, escalated last year when Hamas seized control of the Gaza strip, having routed forces loyal to Mahmoud Abbas-- the Palestinian president and leader of Fatah. Fatah has said it will only agree to reconciliation talks if Hamas first agrees to relinquish its control of Gaza, casting doubt on a recent Yemeni initiative to promote dialogue. Hamas rejects the Fatah condition. Abbas is backed by the United States and its Arab allies including Egypt and Jordan. Hamas, which opposes Abbas's peace talks with Israel, is supported by Syria. Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal lives in exile in Damascus. IRAQ The Arab states' have little influence over conflict in Iraq, where non-Arab Iran has become a major player since the US-led invasion of 2003 toppled Saddam Hussein. The United States has more than 150,000 troops in the country. Sectarian conflict between Sunnis and Shia in Iraq is of major concern to Sunni-run Arab states with their own Shia minorities. These states are concerned by the growing influence of the Shia Islamist government of Iran. Past Arab summit resolutions on Iraq have emphasised respect for Iraq's unity and "Arab identity" and called for steps to quell sectarianism and disarm militias. The predominantly Kurdish north of Iraq has also been a conflict zone, with Turkey having launched attacks on PKK rebels based there in recent mont
