<TITLE> Germany sees chance for fresh EU start with Russia </TITLE>

 Brdo, Slovenia, March 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union should use the election of Dmitry Medvedev as Russia's next president as a chance for a fresh start in relations, Germany said on Friday. Medvedev, elected earlier this month, will take over on May 7 from Vladimir Putin, with whom the EU has often had a rocky relationship. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier told reporters on arrival for an EU foreign ministers' meeting: "Russia has voted. There will be a new President Medvedev and I believe that is an opportunity that we should use." He noted that Medvedev had spoken of wanting to develop the rule of law, civil rights and the market economy. Steinmeier said he hoped the 27 EU ministers would remove hurdles to opening talks with Moscow on a new strategic partnership agreement soon. Differences on how to deal with a resurgent Russia have blocked the start of negotiations since 2006. EU countries are torn between competing desires to promote business and energy interests with Russia and to raise concerns over human rights and its treatment of ex-Soviet neighbours. Poland and Lithuania vetoed the start of talks in 2006 after Moscow banned imports of Polish meat and cut off oil supplies to a Lithuanian refinery that was sold to a Polish company rather than a Russian rival. The new Polish government has agreed to lift its objection after the embargo was ended, but Vilnius is holding out and has added the case of a missing businessman and "frozen conflicts" in Georgia and Moldova to the oil issue, diplomats say. Steinmeier said he understood the concerns of some member states for the security of their energy supplies. "That belongs in the agreement, which is why I am pleading for as early as possible a start to negotiations," he said. BATTLE LINES EU President Slovenia wants the ministers to agree a common line for the EU's first summit with Medvedev in Siberia in June. "We have a post-Putin but still half-Putin era," said one EU official. "What are we doing with it? Can we go the same way, do we want to go the same way or change?" Another EU official said he expected the battle lines would be the same as usual on ties with Moscow. "The French, Germans, Italians and British want to move forward, the Nordics will criticise the absence of...observers at the elections, and the Baltics and Poles will raise their neighbourhood problems with Russia," he said. Separately, EU and Russian officials discussed Moscow's long-delayed World Trade Organisation bid on Thursday but did not reach a breakthrough on the stumbling block issue of Russia's export duties, a European Commission spokesman said. Analyst Mark Leonard at the European Council on Foreign Relations think-tank urged the EU to put its relations with Russia under formal review to iron out what he said were deep-rooted differences on how to deal with Moscow. "There is no real agreement among member states about what kind of country we are dealing with ... that's why the relationship keeps getting held up by bilateral problems." Foreign ministers will also discuss China's suppression of pro-independence protests in Tibet, another issue which for Europe pits lucrative trade and investment ties against human rights concerns. Some senior EU politicians, including European Parliament President Hans-Gert Poettering, have mooted a boycott of the Olympic Games opening ceremony, but others vowed to attend. Ministers will also seek to offer tangible incentives to Western Balkans countries to pursue European integration and turn their backs on nationalism, despite heightened tension over Kosovo's secession from Serbia.
