 LONDON, March 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kingfisher Plc, Europe's biggest home-improvements retailer, slashed its dividend and capital spending plans as it battles tough markets and huge debts, knocking its shares. The owner of UK market leader B&Q and France's Castorama also said on Thursday it was developing new three-year plans which it expected to complete by the middle of the year. "I believe what the business has today is some fantastic potential which over the next three or four years it needs to unlock," Chief Executive Ian Cheshire, the former B&Q head who replaced Gerry Murphy in January, told reporters. UK home-improvement retailers have been battling a slowdown in consumer spending, with shoppers hit by higher bills and a weakening housing market. Kingfisher's adjusted pretax profit fell to 386 million pounds ($774.5 million) in the year to Feb. 2 from 396.6 million the year before, on retail sales up 7.9 percent at 9.4 billion. It had been expected to report profit of 387.6 million according to the average forecast of 26 analysts given to Reuters Estimates. Last month, Kingfisher said profits would be in line with forecasts as lower fourth-quarter B&Q sales were partly offset by a strong performance from Castorama in France and Poland. DIVIDEND SLASHED Kingfisher slashed the final dividend by 50 percent to 3.4 pence, making a total payout of 7.25p against 10.65p last year, with the interim dividend this year expected to be cut by about the same -- saving the company around 120 million pounds in total. Kingfisher is cutting its annual capital spending to around 400 million pounds, from 528 million last year, with an emphasis on investing in its fastest-returning projects. It has also set a target of keeping its net debt unchanged at 1.6 billion pounds this year. "The board's view has been that we have some terrific investment opportunities, but we do need to think about the earnings level, the balance sheet and also the current external environment," Cheshire told reporters as reasons for why it was cutting back spending and had set a net debt target. "We also need to address the dividend ... and rebase it so that it is adequately covered by earnings, it allows that investment to carry on and grow from this base in the future". Shares in Kingfisher, which have underperformed the UK general retailers' index by more than 17 percent in the past 12 months, were down 2 percent at 132.3 pence at 0954 GMT, after a low of 128.6p, valuing it around 3.1 billion pounds. The stock was trailing the DJ Stoxx European retail sector index which was up 1.5 percent. "Cutbacks in capex, and in increase in the investment hurdle rates are both sensible approaches to improving returns, but we're not yet convinced that we'll see meaningful sales progress in the core chain in the year ahead," Panmure Gordon analysts said in a note. Kingfisher also said its property portfolio was now valued at 3.6 billion pounds, up from 3.2 billion previously. "Dividend cut aside, there was little bad news in this statement, and there are positives, particularly with the benefits from Ian Cheshire's review to come and the support of the property portfolio," Seymour Pierce's Andrew Wade said. "However, we continue to be believe, with the outlook for home retailers looking increasingly challenging, that a rating of 12 times 2009 earnings is too high and we reiterate our recommendation of 'Sell'," Wade added in the note. Kingfisher said it was restructuring its poorly performing Chinese B&Q business, resulting in an exceptional charge of 22 million pounds in the year just ended and a further 11 million this ye
