 Jerusalem, March 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said on Sunday she expected Israel to take meaningful steps to improve the lives of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. "I would hope ... we're going to be able to do some things, or that Israel and the Palestinians together will be able to do some things, that are meaningful both for security (for Israel) and for economic viability (for Palestinians)," she told a news conference with Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni. Rice, who arrived in Jerusalem on Saturday for a three-day trip in which she will shuttle between Israeli and Palestinian leaders, has said she was looking for ways to ease Israeli travel restrictions on Palestinians in the West Bank. Four months after peace talks were launched with the goal of reaching a deal before U.S. President George W. Bush leaves office in January, there is little visible progress either on an agreement or on steps to improve the lot of Palestinians. Livni said Israel wanted to help the Palestinians but offered no details on how it might do so and stressed that any steps should not compromise Israeli security. "The idea is to ease the life of the Palestinians," Livni said. "Like always, the formula is to do whatever we can as long as it doesn't affect our own security. Because the other responsibility is to find the way to give security to the Israeli citizens." Israel has said the extensive network of military checkpoints it has erected in the West Bank stops Palestinian militants from reaching its cities. Palestinians call the roadblocks a form of collective punishment.
