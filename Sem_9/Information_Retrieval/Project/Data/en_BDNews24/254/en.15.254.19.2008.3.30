<TITLE> Hasina medically unfit to appear in court: lawyer </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 29 (bdnews24.com)Detained and hospitalised former prime minister Sheikh Hasina has lost 25 per cent of the vision in her left eye and is medically unfit to appear before court, her lawyers said Saturday. However prison authorities, saying her eye condition has improved, maintain that Hasina's own reluctance is the reason she has not appeared in court. The Awami League chief is due to appear before court Sunday as the hearing is set to resume in a case against Hasina, which accuses her of illegally awarding contracts for three barge-mounted power plants during her term as prime minister. After visiting her at Square Hospital on Saturday, her lawyer Barr Shafique Ahmed said Hasina was unwell and in no condition to leave the hospital. "If she is taken out of the hospital her health may seriously suffer." "To force a prisoner, with failing health, to appear before court is illegal," said the lawyer. "We will ask the court for access to the medical report it received on Hasina's health condition. We will compare that report with Hasina's real medical condition." If there was any discrepancy, Shafique said, it would show that the treatment Hasina was receiving was inadequate. Deputy inspector general of prisons Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told reporters Saturday: "As far as I know, Sheikh Hasina's eye condition is better." Her skin allergy has also improved, he said. "Hasina herself is unwilling to appear in court. We hope that if she is well enough, respecting the rule of law, she will agree to appear in court as scheduled." Three of Hasina's lawyers, barrister Shafique, advocate Shahara Khatun and advocate Qamrul Islam, arrived at Square Hospital around 5pm Saturday to visit Hasina. Shafique told reporters after the visit: "Hasina has lost 25 per cent of the vision in her left eye." "She is still suffering problems with her right ear. Her allergies have not improved. There is now also a problem with Hasina's thyroid gland." "Her condition is unfit for leaving the hospital." Hasina's husband M Wazed Miah, along with other relatives, also visited the detained former prime minister in hospital Saturday, arriving at about 7.30pm. bdnews24.c
