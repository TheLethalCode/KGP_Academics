<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 29 (bdnews24.com) -- Representatives from a variety of interest groups Saturday said the proposed National Security Council was necessary to ensure the security and economic development of the country. "The geo-strategic location of Bangladesh, its economic development and unique demographic profile all pose multifaceted security challenges," said Prof Ataur Rahman, who moderated a roundtable discussion on at the Sheraton Hotel. The Bangladesh Institute of Leadership and Security Studies organised the discussion on the possible structure of the proposed security council. Prof Ataur said the NSC could either be established constitutionally when the next parliament is elected or a new ordinance could be enacted now to form the council. "If Bangladesh continues with the parliamentary system, the proposed NSC should be placed under the president to create appropriate checks and balances to prime ministerial power," he said. The Dhaka University political science professor said opinion varied widely on how many members the proposed NSC should have, with figures ranging from seven to 13. He said the NSC should be expanded to include political leaders, military personnel, members of intelligence agencies, bureaucrats and business leaders among others. "The exact status of members of the NSC should also be determined, while the national security adviser's position should be in the rank of a minister," Ataur said. The position of 'chairman of the joint chiefs of staff'as in the United Statescould be created to act as the NSC adviser, he added. The professor said the NSC would play the leading role among the security agencies, providing directives or guidelines to all other related agencies, departments or ministries. Commandant of the National Defence College Lt Gen ATM Zahirul Alam said: "The NSC may include the president, the prime minister, the leader of the opposition, the foreign minister, the finance minister, chiefs of the three armed forces, the cabinet secretary and civilians." Former education minister Osman Farruk said the NSC had no role to play in the nation's economic security, facing natural disasters or attack from outside the country. However, a platform may be created to build civil-military relations and dialogue between political parties. All stake holders can speak there, he said. "It has to be determined whether the role of the NSC would be advisory or consultative," added Farruk. bdne
