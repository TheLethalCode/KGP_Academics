 KARACHI, March 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's cricket board will not try to stop players from the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL) taking part in English county cricket, officials said on Saturday. "Our policy on the ICL players is clear. They are not contracted to us nor are they eligible to play in any tournament in Pakistan. But if they go and play county or shield cricket we can't stop them," Shafqat Naghmi, the chief operating officer of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) told Reuters. "We have no legal or moral reason to stop ICL players from playing in any event in any other country apart from Pakistan," he said. "If anyone in any other country wants to play them it is their decision." Around 16 players from Pakistan are appearing in the ICL, a Twenty20 event in its second year, at the moment. The PCB has banned ICL players from playing domestic cricket. The ICL is bankrolled by the controllers of India's largest listed media firm but has not been sanctioned by the International Cricket Council (ICC)
