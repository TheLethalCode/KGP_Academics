 DAMASCUS, March 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas blasted Israel on Saturday, saying it was expanding Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank to undermine plans for a viable Palestinian state. "The parameters and plans of the solution that Israel is drawing on the ground would not leave more than a group of isolated enclaves of land torn apart by settlements and the wall of racial separation," Abbas told an Arab summit in Damascus. "It is a solution that reinforces the occupation and the settlement process and which threatens to undermine the possibility of setting up the independent state of Palestine on the Palestinian people's land, the land of Palestine," he said. Defying U.S. criticism and sparking protests from Palestinians, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said this month Israel would not stop building on occupied land in and around Arab East Jerusalem. Washington has called settlement building near Jerusalem unhelpful. Settlements are illegal under international law. "Jerusalem ... is facing the most vicious settlement campaign which is aimed at its Arab character through confiscation of lands, building settlements and destroying houses of (Arab) residents with the aim of isolating Jerusalem from the rest of the Palestinian lands." Palestinians see the building in Jabal Abu Ghneim, also known as Har Homa, near Jerusalem as the last rampart in a wall of settlements encircling Arab East Jerusalem, cutting it off from the rest of the occupied West Bank. OBSTACLES TO PEACE Settlement building has been one of the obstacles preventing progress in the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, relaunched by U.S. President George W. Bush in Maryland in November. Other sensitive final status issues include the fate of Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees and borders. Abbas, whose authority has been limited to the West Bank since Hamas Islamists seized the Gaza Strip in June, wants to reach a full peace agreement with Israel allowing him to declare statehood. He is set to meet U.S. Secretary of Condoleezza Rice in Amman on Sunday and Monday and visit Washington in May for talks with Bush on Israeli-Palestinian peace. Abbas condemned Israeli attacks on the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip in recent months that have left scores of civilians dead. "It is no secret that the ongoing Israeli aggression is part of an Israeli policy that aims at dividing the Palestinian territories and people by separating the Gaza Strip from the West Bank to prevent the possibility of a peace agreement under the pretext of Palestinian divisions," he said. Abbas asked the summit to stand by the Arab peace initiative, first launched at a summit in Beirut in 2002. "But at the same time, that must be coupled with an international movement by the international community... to make Israel abide by it," he said. The initiative offers Israel peace and normal relations with all Arab countries in return for withdrawal from all territory captured in the Middle East war of 1967. Israeli governments have rejected or ignored the initiative, which would require dismantling settlements which house hundreds of thousands of Jews in East Jerusalem and the West Bank.
