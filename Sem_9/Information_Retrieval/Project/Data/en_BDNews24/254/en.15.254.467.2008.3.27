 BELGRADE, March 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Netherlands staged a remarkable comeback to win 4-3 in Austria while European champions Greece beat Portugal 2-1 as all 16 Euro 2008 finalists contested friendlies on Wednesday. England midfielder David Beckham will look back at his 100th international appearance with bittersweet emotions after Fabio Capello's side, who did not qualify for the June tournament, suffered a 1-0 defeat to France in Paris. In the day's late kick-off, a David Villa goal in the 78th minute gave Spain a 1-0 win over world champions Italy. The Valencia striker rifled in an unstoppable shot past keeper Gianluigi Buffon after the Italians had missed several good chances, Mauro Camoranesi rattling the crossbar. The Dutch were 3-0 down against Euro 2008 co-hosts Austria after 35 minutes but two late goals from strikers Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink and Klaas Jan Huntelaar gave them the win after they had clawed their way back into the match. Andreas Ivanschitz and a Sebastian Proedl brace had fired the Austrians ahead before Huntelaar and John Heitinga replied for the Dutch to make the score 3-2. Vennegoor of Hesselink grabbed an 82nd-minute equaliser and Huntelaar completed the comeback with his sixth goal in 11 international appearances. England, looking for their first win over France in Paris since 1949, were fortunate not to concede more goals after a solid first half performance. Bayern midfielder Franck Ribery steered in a 32nd minute penalty after David James had brought down Nicolas Anelka and contributed to Beckham's 38th-minute booking after the Los Angeles Galaxy midfielder pulled his shirt. But Beckham was given a standing ovation by both sets of fans when he was substituted in the 63rd minute and was delighted after a good individual display. "I am very proud of this 100th cap, it does not happen to everybody. It was amazing," he told reporters. "The most important thing was to prove my fitness and I thought I did. Tonight I enjoyed myself, that's the biggest thing." FIRST DEFEAT What Beckham will not savour is the first defeat for Capello as England manager after the 2-1 win over Switzerland in a friendly on his debut last month. Greece, who beat Euro 2004 hosts Portugal in the event's opening match and final, upset their more heralded rivals again thanks to a Georgos Karagounis brace. The former Benfica midfielder rifled in two superb free kicks in Dusseldorf, Germany, before Nuno Gomes pulled one back for an understrength Portuguese side. Germany, who won their last international honour at Euro 1996 in England, strolled to a 4-0 win over neighbours and Euro 2008 co-hosts Switzerland. Mario Gomes scored two goals for Germany in Basel either side of Miroslav Klose's opener and an 88th-minute effort by Lukas Podolski as all three strikers found the back of the net for the visitors. At the Emirates stadium in London, AC Milan teenager Alexandre Pato scored on his debut for Brazil to give the five-time world champions a 1-0 win over Sweden. The 18-year-old striker dispossessed keeper Rami Shabaan near the touchline and curled in a superb lob into an empty net midway through the second half. In Glasgow, Portsmouth midfielder Niko Kranjcar gave Croatia an early lead against Scotland when he lashed in a brilliant shot on the turn before Kenny Miller's deflected effort on the half-hour mark secured a 1-1 draw in an absorbing encounter. Elsewhere, the United States recorded a 3-0 win away win over Poland, Romania thrashed fellow Euro 2008 finalists Russia by the same score and Turkey twice came from behind to earn a 2-2 draw at Belarus. Arsenal's 20-year old striker Nicklas Bendtner scored his seventh international goal in 16 appearances for Denmark in their 1-1 draw with the Czech Republic. In a battle of the smaller nations, Malta registered a rare win and easily the biggest in their history after Coventry City striker Michael Mifsud scored five goals in a 7-1 rout of Lichtenstei
