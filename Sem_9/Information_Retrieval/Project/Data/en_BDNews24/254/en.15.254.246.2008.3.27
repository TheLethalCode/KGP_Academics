 Dhaka, March 27 (bdnews24.com)The Awami League Thursday warned that a dangerous situation would arise in the country if the interim government failed to hold immediate talks with political parties. The party's acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam said it became urgent for the government to hold talks with the political parties to "avert clashes". Ashraful made the comment after a meeting of the party presidium at acting party president Zillur Rahman's Gulshan home. "If dialogue is not held a dangerous situation will arise. Confrontation begins where dialogue stops. In the presidium meeting we have talked about the dialogue to stop any confrontation." He said the dialogue was important to build a consensus on some pressing issues such as an end to the state of emergency, countrywide indoor politics and an election schedule. "Dialogue will make everybody understand that the government is not biased to anybody," Ashraful said. The issues of withdrawal of the state of emergency, introduction of indoor politics across the country, proper treatment of AL president Sheikh Hasina, and high prices of daily commodities came up for discussion in the meeting, he said. Zillur Rahman presided over the meeting, also attended by senior leaders Amir Hossain Amu, Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed, Suranjit Sengupta and Motia Chowdhury. bdnews24.com
