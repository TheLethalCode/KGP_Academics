 BERNE, Switzerland, March 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Co-hosts Switzerland and Austria have mountains to climb to get ready for Euro 2008 after the two Alpine nations were beaten in Wednesday's warm-up friendlies. After boasting they were ready to end 51 years of domination by neighbours Germany, Switzerland were routed 4-0 in Basel, their fourth defeat in a row. Austria, with one win from their previous 13 outings, were less confident against Netherlands until they went 3-0 up in 35 minutes in Vienna. But, by the time the final whistle blew, they had lost 4-3. In Basel, where Switzerland will open Euro 2008 against Czech Republic on June 7, there were loud boos and whistles. "There's nothing I can say to make it look good," Swiss coach Koebi Kuhn told reporters. "Germany outplayed us all over the pitch but we also helped out with unnecessary mistakes that made us look amateurish." Kuhn said there was little to learn from such a thrashing and his team would have to put the match behind them if they wanted to improve at Euro 2008. Thursday's Swiss newspapers seemed more eager for action, questioning Kuhn's decision to switch his regular formation by moving winger Tranquillo Barnetta into a playmaker role behind strikers Alex Frei and Eren Derdiyok. "It clearly didn't work," said the country's best-selling tabloid Blick. "With just over two months to go until the start of Euro 2008 it's time to stop experimenting." TITLE AMBITIONS Kuhn has repeatedly said his young side, filled with players based at top clubs across Europe, should be aiming for the European title in June. But with key players like Frei and central defender Philippe Senderos fighting for fitness and starting places at their clubs, Kuhn was criticised by the papers. "Who can talk about the European title now?", read a headline in the Neue Zuercher Zeitung broadsheet. "Nothing positive can be taken from this game," said the paper. "The trainer will have to go back to the drawing board." Having already used up a vast library of negative headlines in the past 12 months, the Austrian media praised its team's early display against the Dutch. "Blitz start, bitter end," was the headline in the Standard while the Oesterreich said "3-4, stupid defeat". Unlike his Swiss counterpart, Austria coach Josef Hickersberger said he could take positives from a "well-played and aggressive" first half. "But we defended too deep in the second half and lost our concentration," he told reporters. "The Dutch have the class to exploit any weaknesses, as they certainly showed." Choosing Austria and Switzerland as co-hosts has always carried the risk of an early exit by one or both teams, with possible repercussions for the atmosphere at the final
