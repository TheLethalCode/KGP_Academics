<TITLE> Croatian police seek ex-general after killings </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Zagreb, March 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Croatian police said on Friday they had launched an extensive search for a former general in connection with four violent deaths in the north of the country. They said four murder victims had been found in the last two days at three different places in the north Croatian region of Zagorje, and retired general Ivan Korade might have important information related to the killings. "We believe that Korade has information that could help us resolve these cases," police spokesman Krunoslav Borovec told the local media. He declined to say whether Korade, whose whereabouts are unknown, was a suspect. Media reports said special police units and helicopters were involved in the search, and police said they had contacted police in neighbouring Slovenia in case Korade had crossed the border. Korade was one of the main commanders in the 1995 Croatian offensive, codenamed "Storm", that recaptured swathes of Croatian territory from rebel Serb forces. Police have said he was involved in several violent incidents in recent years.
