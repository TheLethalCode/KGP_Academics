 LONDON, March 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's FTSE 100 index rose 0.8 percent early on Thursday as miners gained on firmer metal prices, while shares in caterer Compass Group rose after its strong trading statement. By 0843 GMT, the FTSE 100 was up 44.2 points at 5,704.5, after falling 0.5 percent in the previous session. The UK benchmark index has lost 11 percent so far this year thanks to the credit market turmoil and fears of a US recession, and is on course for its worst quarter since the third quarter of 2002 and its third quarter of losses.

Banks were firmer, with Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, HBOS, Lloyds TSB, HSBC and Standard Chartered up between 0.7 and 2.9 percent. Miners tracked higher metal prices, with gold jumping to a one-week high. Xstrata put on 2.4 percent, Anglo American added 1.4 percent, and BHP Billiton tacked on 1.6 percent. The final reading of US fourth-quarter gross domestic product data will offer a further gauge of the state of the world's largest economy. Two US Federal Reserve officials warned on Wednesday that the central bank needed to be wary of a rise in inflation even as it navigates the country through an economic slowdown.
