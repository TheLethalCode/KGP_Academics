 PARIS, March 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks were slightly lower around midday on Friday as weakening shares of banks and consumer product groups overshadowed a rally in mining stocks buoyed by upbeat brokerage comments. Pharmaceuticals were on the upside, with Sanofi-Aventis up 2.5 percent, benefiting from results from a study that showed the company's insulin drug Lantus controls blood sugar as effectively as Eli Lilly's Humalog. At 1059 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.1 percent at 1,270.24 points. The benchmark index is on track to end the week with a gain of 3.6 percent as investors have started to come back to stocks, hammered over the past few months by concerns over the global credit crisis as well as fears of a US recession. "We're starting to see some relief in the wake of quite decisive actions from the Fed and there is some hope that the worst of the financial crisis and most of the writedowns are behind us," said Ad van Tiggelen, senior strategist at ING Investment Management. "But chances are that we will see new lows in the coming months, so I would still describe this rise more as a bear market rally than as a start of a new bull market. It will remain a difficult environment until investors see the low in earnings for the cycle, and I think that will happen sometime next year, not this year," he said. The FTSEurofirst 300, down 16 percent since the start of the year, is on track to record its worst quarterly performance in nearly six years. The index has tracked global equities lower on fears that credit-market ructions stemming from a meltdown in risky U.S. mortgages will slow the broader economy and concerns over the financial sector, which has suffered massive writedowns. "The focus will now be more on U.S. economic data, with the decoupling/recoupling story on one side and the earnings outlook on the other side. Even if the U.S. recession remains modest, we will see four to five quarters of downward revisions of forecast, based on higher input costs, higher financing costs and slower revenue growth," van Tiggelen said. Miners contributed the most points to the index, with Anglo American up 4.1 percent, Rio Tinto up 2.8 percent and BHP Billiton rising 2.5 percent after Deutsche Bank lifted price targets for some companies in the sector. Shares of banks and consumer products companies were among the biggest laggards, with L'Oreal down 1.5 percent, Danone down 1.1 percent, Banco Santander down 0.4 percent and Deutsche Bank down 0.5 percent. Lloyds TSB fell 1.4 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported that the head of the British bank's U.K. retail banking business would move to Citigroup. A spokesman for Lloyds declined to confirm her move. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE was up 0.1 percent, Germany's DAX up 0.2 percent, and France's CAC down 0.1 percent. US DATA EYED Later in the session, investors' attention will shift to core inflation data from the United States. The Federal Reserve has cut rates 200 basis points so far this year, giving a fillip to equity markets, but analysts said the moves were not having enough of an impact on the crucial banking sector. Justin Urquhart Stewart of 7 Investment Management said more rate cuts would still be "like pushing on a piece of string", noting that the Federal Reserve had set its sights on growth. "Even if inflation were still rising we'd still suspect another rate cut at the end of April," Bear Stearns said in a note. British house prices fell for a fifth straight month in March, bringing the annual rate of increase to its lowest in 12 years, the Nationwide Building Society figures showed. Taylor Wimpey, Barratt Developments and Persimmon fell 2.5 to 6.8 percent. Traders attributed the fall to the housing data and profit-taking after a rally on Thursd
