 NAPIER, New Zealand, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England left-arm seamer Ryan Sidebottom was crucial to his side beating New Zealand in the third test and winning the series, losing captain Daniel Vettori said on Wednesday. New Zealand lost the third test in Napier by 121 runs, giving England a 2-1 victory in the series with Sidebottom claiming 24 wickets at an average of 17.07. He took his first 10-wicket haul in tests and completed a hat-trick in Hamilton before running through New Zealand's first innings in Napier with career-best figures of seven for 47. "You have to sit back and admire how well Sidebottom bowled throughout the series, he was the difference between the two teams," Vettori told reporters. "Every time they needed a lift he came in and gave it to them. "His length of spells, the pace, the consistency, everything he did in the series set himself up as a world-class bowler. He set England up for these last two tests." Vettori also agreed with his England counterpart Michael Vaughan the visitors had seized their opportunities, swinging the series in their favour after New Zealand won the first test by 189 runs. "It was a pretty competitive series the whole way through but England grabbed vital chances in the second and third tests and in the end were deserved winners," Vettori added. "They just took opportunities we failed to capitalise on." The New Zealand captain pointed to the 164-run partnership between Tim Ambrose and Paul Collingwood with England in trouble in the second test as another key moment. "If you look at the last session on the first day of the second test and the second and third sessions on the second day here (Sidebottom) where we capitulated with the bat, England dominated from there on in," he said. "It is bitterly disappointing from where we were at Hamilton
