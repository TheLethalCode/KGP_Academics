<TITLE> Britain names Pringle as new Russian envoy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, March 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain, whose ties with Russia are at their chilliest since the Cold War, named Anne Pringle on Friday as its next ambassador to Moscow, saying she would replace Tony Brenton in October when he retires. Pringle has been director for strategy and information at the Foreign Office for the past three years, before which she was ambassador to the Czech Republic. She worked in Moscow from 1980 to 1983. Ties between London and Moscow are at a low ebb, partly because of Russia's refusal to extradite a former KGB agent wanted for trial in Britain for the murder in London of a Russian critic of the Kremlin who had taken British citizenship. That led to diplomats being expelled from both countries and to the forced closure of two regional offices in Russia of the British Council, the cultural arm of the British government.
