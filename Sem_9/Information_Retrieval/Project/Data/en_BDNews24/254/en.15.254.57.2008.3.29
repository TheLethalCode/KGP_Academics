 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, March 29 (bdnews24.com) -- The Election Commission has proposed fixing the amount candidates to local government bodies can spend on election expenses on the basis of the number of voters in the constituency, election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain said Saturday. Under the changes, a mayoral candidate for Dhaka city, which has 35 lakh voters, will be allowed to spend a maximum of Tk 15 lakh on election expenses. A mayoral candidate to Chittagong city will be allowed to spend Tk 10 lakh, while the expenditure ceiling for a mayoral candidate to the other city corporations is to be Tk 5 lakh. A councillor (previously known as a ward commissioner) will have an expenditure ceiling of Tk 2.5 lakh. If the number of voters is low the expenditure ceiling would also be lower, said the commissioner. He said the local government election rules would be finalised as soon as the ordinances for the city corporations and municipalities are gazetted. Previously a mayoral candidate in Dhaka could spend Tk 5 lakh, while in Chittagong the figure was Tk 3 lakh and mayoral candidates in other corporations were limited to Tk 2 lakh. Upazila chairman were restricted to a war chest of Tk 3 lakh, while a municipal chairman could spend Tk 2 lakh and union chairman Tk 1 lakh. "However, the rules were not strictly monitored, although from now on the rules will have to be strictly adhered to," said Sakhawat. Badiul Alam Majumder, a member of the local government strengthening committee, told bdnews24.com that they had proposed fixing the maximum expenditure for mayors at Tk five lakh, and councillors at Tk 1 lakh. According the proposed EC rules, a mayoral candidate in a city with no more than five lakh voters can spend up to Tk 5 lakh. A candidate in a city corporation with five to 10 lakh voters can spend Tk 7 lakh, while a candidate running in a city where the number of voters is 10 to 20 lakh would be allowed to spend a maximum of Tk 10 lakh. A mayoral candidate in a city corporation having more than 20 lakh voters is to be allowed to spend up to Tk 15 lakh. According to the EC proposals, a candidate to the post of councillor in an area with no more than 15,000 voters will have a maximum expenditure of Tk 1 lakh. Where the number of voters are 15,000 to 30,000 the ceiling will be Tk 1.5 lakh, while candidate in an area with 30,000 to 50,000 voters would be allowed to spend Tk 2 lakh. Where the number of voters is more than 50,000 a councillor candidate can spend up to Tk 2.5 lakh. According to the EC secretariat, 35 lakh voters have so far been registered in Dhaka city, a little more than 10 lakh in Chittagong, 2.57 lakh in Rajshahi, 3.98 lakh in Khulna, 1.77 lakh in Barisal and 2.54 lakh in Sylhet. According to the proposed rules, all money has to be spent through candidates agents and an expenditure statement has to be submitted to the Election Commission within 30 days of the results. If any irregularity are discovered the candidate will be removed from the election. Further proposed regulations include limiting the size and colour of election posters, restricting the size of supporters gathering areas to 400 square feet and restrictions entertaining voters. The proposed rules make disclosing the source of a candidate's election expenses mandatory. Election commissioner Sakhawat told bdnews24.com Saturday the election rules would be strictly enforced in local body elections. He recently told reporters that the EC had plans to hold six city corporation elections in May. bdnew
