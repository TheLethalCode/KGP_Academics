 LONDON, March 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks slipped by midday on Wednesday, giving up some of the previous session's sharp gains as miner Xstrata sank 7 percent after bid talks with Brazil's Vale broke down. At 1235 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.8 percent at 1,255.73 points, as weak US durable goods data weighed further on the market. The index surged 3.2 percent on Tuesday as banks rebounded but they were again the biggest sector losers in Wednesday's session. Vodafone rose 2.2 percent making it the top weighted gainer. The world's largest mobile phone company by revenue said it expected to start receiving dividends from U.S. joint venture Verizon Wireless next year. The FTSEurofirst 300 has lost more than 16 percent since the start of the year, as fears of a US recession and worries over the impact of a credit crisis hit global stock markets. "I think that we are reaching a floor, at least for now. Historically, when the market starts pricing in a recession, there is a 20 percent drop in stocks. And this time, equities were not overpriced when the downturn started," said Jean-Luc Buchalet, CEO of Pythagore Investissement, in Paris. Evidence of troubles in the financial sector and its impact on the wider economy have pushed major central banks towards monetary easing but the European Central Bank has stayed put thus far, sticking to its inflation mandate. "Both the ECB and the BoE are holding at these higher levels and there's such a disparity now between them and where the Fed have their rates," said Jimmy Yates, dealer at CMC Markets. "The pressures in the US are going to have a knock-on effect. It's whether it's going to be hard enough that they need to cut rates to encourage spending." The Federal Reserve has cut rates by 200 basis points this year as it tries to stave off a recession in the world's largest economy. BoE Governor Mervyn King said on Wednesday tighter lending conditions have made the BoE more inclined to cut interest rates as the credit crunch enters a new and difficult phase. XSTRATA SINKS Xstrata was Europe's biggest laggard on Wednesday after Vale, the world's largest iron ore miner, said talks to buy its Swiss rival had failed and that Vale would look at other potential takeover targets. Xstrata fell as much as 12.3 percent to 3,260 pence before paring losses when Merrill Lynch advised clients to buy aggressively into the Anglo-Swiss miner at below 3,300 pence. In the banking sector, Deutsche Bank fell 2.2 percent after the German lender said the disruption to revenues and writedowns on assets stemming from the global credit crisis could put its profit goal for this year at risk. The bank said its business in corporate and investment banking, the areas most directly affected by financial market turbulence, was likely to be considerably lower in the near term. "This can almost be seen as a profit warning. They said they may need to make further writedowns and that is not good news at the moment," one trader said. "(But) the share price might also turn over the course of the day as markets may see it as a positive sign that Deutsche Bank cleared the air," he added. The DJ Stoxx European banking index was down 1.4 percent, with HSBC down 1 percent, Societe Generale down 2.4 and Credit Agricole 1.8 percent lower. Banking shares have been hit over the past eight months by worries over the impact of rising mortgage delinquencies in the risky US subprime market that have forced banks to write down assets. The latest casualty was Bear Stearns, recently ranked as the fifth-largest US investment bank, whose collapse pushed the Federal Reserve to assume control of its assets valued at $30 billion. Around Europe, France's CAC 40 was down 0.5 percent, Germany's DAX shed 0.3 percent and Britain's FTSE 100 was 0.5 percent lower.
