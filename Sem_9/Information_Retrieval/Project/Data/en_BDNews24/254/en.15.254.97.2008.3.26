<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 26 (bdnews24.com)The Dhaka University Teachers Association Wednesday suspended its annual election under alleged pressure from the government. The election scheduled for Thursday has been reset for April 12, according to a new decision. In a handwritten statement, Prof Anwar Hossain, general secretary of the DUTA, alleged that the government had asked the association to halt the election. DUTA held a press conference Wednesday evening and condemned what Prof Anwar said was the government's pressure on the DUTA executive committee. "Some members of joint forces went to the house of election director Prof Dalem Chandra Barman (early Wednesday) to pressure him into delaying the polls," he said. "The incident spread panic. The DUTA executive committee is condemning such attitude of the government," Prof Anwar said. The teacher also mentioned that a letter from the Dhaka Metropolitan Police reached the DUTA office at 4pm Wednesday, just 18 hours prior to the election. "The letter asked the DUTA to defer the election by at least 15 days," he said. "We hope that the government would not further interfere in the election," he added. bdnews2
