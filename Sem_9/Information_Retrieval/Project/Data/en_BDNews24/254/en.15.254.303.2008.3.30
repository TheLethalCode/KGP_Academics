<TEXT>
 ROME, March 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - AS Roma captain Francesco Totti will miss Tuesday's Champions League quarter-final first leg against Manchester United at the Olympic stadium with a thigh injury. "At the end of yesterday's encounter, Francesco Totti complained of a pain in the flexor of his left thigh," the club said on their Web site (www.asroma.it), referring to Saturday's 1-1 Serie A draw at Cagliari in which the striker scored. "In the morning of Sunday March 30 he was subjected to tests that highlighted a muscular injury in the cavity of the left thigh flexor. The player will have to have a period of rest and the situation will be monitored over the next few days." Totti's loss is a big blow to Italy's sole Champions League survivor. He is their top scorer in Serie A this term with 14 goals and he picked up the European Golden Boot last season with 26 league strikes
