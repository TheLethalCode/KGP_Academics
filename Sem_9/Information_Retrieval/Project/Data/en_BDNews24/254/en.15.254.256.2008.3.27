<TEXT>
 SOFIA, March 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso will use his trip to Bulgaria on Friday to press the Balkan EU newcomer to take steps to combat rampant corruption. Brussels has suspended some aid to Bulgaria due to suspicion of fraud, sending a signal it was running out of patience with Sofia's all-but-paralysed efforts to tame organised crime and graft. "Barroso will emphasize that in the first year of membership, there had been insufficient progress on these issues and efforts need to be stepped up before the first full report in July," an EU official told Reuters. Barroso will meet Prime Minister Sergei Stanishev and other officials. He will discuss the Lisbon Strategy on economic reform, Bulgaria's role in the bloc's energy policy and will also receive Bulgaria's highest decoration order. The EU has not recommended sanctions against Bulgaria but diplomats said the threat of punitive measures that could affect the 11 billion euros earmarked for Sofia by 2013 was there. Bulgaria and its bigger Balkan neighbour Romania joined the EU two years later than most ex-communist central European nations largely due to concerns they have not reformed their judiciary systems to make them compatible with the bloc. They rank as the most corruption-infested among the EU's 27 nations, with Transparency International placing them in the 64th and 69th position respectively in its 2007 corruption survey of 180 countries. "The government is underestimating the effects of not taking sufficient action," an EU diplomat in Sofia said. "They should take the freeze of funds as a message that they will be held accountable. They should see it as a chance to clean up their act." Surveys show fraud and crime cost the poorest EU nation Bulgaria over a billion euros a year. The government in Sofia insists it is doing what it can but not a single high-level official has been sentenced over graft. Some EU funds for road repairs were frozen after two senior officials at the state road infrastructure fund were caught taking bribes. Some agriculture aid to Bulgaria was also suspended over suspected fraud. The Socialist-led government has played down the impact of the EU fund freezes and blamed it partly on miscommunication with Brussels. Last week, it announced measures to tighten controls and improve transparency. Analysts say politicians and magistrates are often linked to shadowy business groups and the difficult balance within the three ruling parties is not helping to speed up the clean-up. "The biggest weakness of this government is its sluggishness. Everything is being postponed," said political commentator Andrei Raichev of Gallup International in Sof
