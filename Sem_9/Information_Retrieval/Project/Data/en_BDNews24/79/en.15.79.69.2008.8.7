 KATHMANDU, Thu Aug 7, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - About 2,000 Tibetans and their Nepali supporters took part in anti-China protests in Kathmandu on Thursday, a day before the Olympic Games open in Beijing. Shaven-headed nuns in saffron dress and monks wearing burgundy robes were among protesters who staged a peaceful demonstration in a Kathmandu suburb. Many held strings of holy beads and hummed prayers for "world peace", sitting in an open field as dozens of police kept watch. "Many Tibetans including monks and nuns are tortured and imprisoned by China," said Karma, a 54-year-old nun, holding a yellow and white Buddhist flag. "We are protesting for their release and appealing to the international community to help to release these religious people," she said. The Olympic torch was carried along the ancient Great Wall on Thursday after a tortuous and troubled route around the world that has often acted as a lightning rod for anti-China protests from Tibetans and their supporters. More than 20,000 Tibetan refugees still live in Nepal since they fled their homeland following a failed uprising against Chinese rule in 1959. They have been holding regular protests after deadly anti-government riots broke out in the Tibetan capital Lhasa and other areas in China in mid-March. Protesters carried the Nepali national flag and Buddhist flags. They wore yellow jackets which read "Long live His Holiness the Dalai Lama" and "Stop cultural genocide in Tibet". Protest leader Tsultrim Dorjee said the Olympic Games opening in Beijing on Friday gave the exiles a good opportunity to highlight their plight. "The world is watching on China," he said. "Prior to the Olympics it is a good platform for us to raise the issue of Tibet." Nepal says Tibet is part of China, an important trade partner and aid donor, and does not allow anti-China activities. Hundreds of protesters have been detained over the past few months. Organisers said police tore up a huge portrait of the Dalai Lama as the exiles prepared to stage a hunger strike to draw attention of the international community about the situation in Tibet
