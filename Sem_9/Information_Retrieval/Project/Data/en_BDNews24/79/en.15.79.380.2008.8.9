<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com) - BNP secretary general Khandker Delwar Hossain on Saturday called on party adherents to build up a movement for release of detained chief Khaleda Zia. "The government has made itself an opponent of BNP. We've no time to waste. Everyone will have to prepare to launch a movement. We'll give programmes in phases," said Delwar without enlarging on the programmes. He gave the call from a views-exchange meeting of the pro-BNP lawyers' grouping, the Jatiyatabadi Ainjibi Forum. The forum's Dhaka unit organised the meeting at the Supreme Court Bar Association auditorium, drawing in leaders from the districts. Delwar expressed outrage at the government's 'double-dealing' on the release of the former prime minister. "Two sets of law are in force in one country. Somebody is being released and sent abroad. Our leader has been confined to the jail. It does not go with the characteristics of a neutral government. They are working following the dictates of a special quarter." Delwar termed the activities of the government and the Election Commission manifestation of a blueprint", evident in their holding local government elections instead of parliament elections. He said BNP did not go to the elections as it would have given acceptance to the government's unconstitutional activities. Without naming expelled BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, Delwar said, "We have boycotted the local government election, which was a right decision. The person who is saying that it was not the right thing to do has no right to say so. He is nobody to BNP." Delwar alleged that those who created the incidents of Jan 11 'by creating instability' want to hold polls keeping BNP in the cold. "BNP will not participate in any election without Khaleda Zia. A fair election must be held with the participation of all parties and leaders including Khaleda Zia. Otherwise the country will drift into further instability." He advised the government not to hold an election of "blueprint" and urged the lawyers to strengthen the organisation at grassroots level. Jatiyatabadi Ainjibi Forum Dhaka Unit president advocate Fazlur Rahman Khan presided over the programme at which general secretary advocate Sanaullah Miah, advocate Masud Ahmed Talukder and lawyers from different districts spoke. Founder member of the organisation Justice TH Khan, Justice Habibul Islam Bhuiyan, advocate Zainal Abedin, advocate Nitai Roy Chowdhury, former lawmaker Mehedi Ahmed Rumi, advocate Selim Reza Habib and advocate Syed Moazzem Hossain Alal were among those present. The forum announced that the lawyers would hold a human chain on August 21 in demand for the release of Khaleda. bdne
