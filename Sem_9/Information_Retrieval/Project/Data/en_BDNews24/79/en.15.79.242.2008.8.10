<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com)  The BNP-led four-party alliance on Sunday vowed to wage a tough movement in case BNP chief Khaleda Zia was not released within 72 hours. "If Khaleda Zia is not released within 72 hours and (her son) Tarique Rahman is not sent abroad for medical treatment, the alliance will give a tough programme," BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said at an alliance rally at the Diploma Engineers Institution auditorium. They would hold the government responsible if instability surfaces in the country, he said. Delwar asked the government to hold dialogue after release of Khaleda. "Sit with the leader if you mean to seek advice about the election. The four-party alliance will extend help to the government," he said. The BNP leader continued maintaining that the Aug 4 polls to four city corporations and nine municipalities were unconstitutional. "We boycotted this election on the grounds that an unelected government has no right to hold any other election barring the national polls." Delwar said the people would not accept any election by keeping Khaleda Zia and Tarique in prison. bdnews24
