<TITLE> British 14-year-old puts Beijing in a spin </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIJING, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Olympic Games is all just a bit of fun for precocious British platform diver Tom Daley. The 14-year-old has hogged the headlines in recent months and will become Britain's second youngest Olympian when he takes his first leap off the Beijing boards next week. "It's been absolutely amazing so far, a phenomenal experience," the pint-sized Daley told reporters on Friday. "I can't wait, I just want to go out and have fun." Daley's presence in Beijing has caused a media frenzy, with cameramen and photographers jostling to get a glimpse of the precocious schoolboy. Since qualifying for the Olympics, he is even recognised by Chinese diving fans. "Walking around the street people here recognise me it's kind of weird," Daley said, craning his neck to edge closer to the microphone. "When you're little you dream of being famous, its strange, you don't expect it to happen." Despite becoming this year the youngest European diving champion, aged 13, the 1.57-metre tall Daley says medals are unlikely this time around and he is targeting the 2012 London Olympics as his chance to shine. "I just want to see what it's all about and take that to London 2012," he added. Platform synchro partner Blake Aldridge, whose previous partner died in a hit-and-run incident last year, said he had a unique chemistry with Daley. "Tom has helped me along the way. We instantly clicked," the 26-year-old Aldridge said. "He's a breath of fresh air to be around, he's lapping it up here. He always has a smile on his face, he's full of beans.
