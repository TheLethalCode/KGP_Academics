 Dhaka, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com)  The Communist Party of Bangladesh (CPB) in a change to its constitution has reserved for women a third of the posts in every tier of the party and made presidium members and secretaries full-time political job. "An attempt has to be made so that at least one-third women members may be included in any tier of the party," party spokesman Syed Abu Zafar Ahmed said on conclusion of the ninth party congress on Saturday. "Besides, the congress has decided that presidium members and secretaries of the party cannot remain in any other profession." The amendments to the constitution mean the CPB will follow the Leninist organisational principles. Besides, the party has approved a 51-member central committee instead of the 41-member one. Zafar said, "In order to attain revolutionary democratic changes in society and state to pull the country from the present crisis, the ninth congress has targeted three steps as its main tasks. "These three are: outside the bourgeois stream, an alternative left democratic force having ability, competence and confidence of the masses has to be built up so as to help control state power. The party will popularise the mass-oriented programmes that serve the causes of the people, in addition to anti-imperialist move. Finally, it will strengthen the alternative forces that can weaken the authority of the existing class in power." The party has decided to take part in the general elections if the climate was right, the spokesman said. "We will participate in the national elections if such climate prevails. We have no objection to upazila elections if it does not disturb the national elections. We are in favour of local elections." The ninth congress began on Thursday, with 13 representatives from India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Nepal, China, North Korea and Vietnam attending it. bdne
