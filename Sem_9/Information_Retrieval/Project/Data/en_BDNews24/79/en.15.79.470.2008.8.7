 HEBRON, West Bank,Thu Aug 7, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A small group of Jewish settlers attacked a delegation of British diplomats during a visit to the West Bank city of Hebron on Thursday, the British Consulate said. The consulate in Jerusalem said the diplomats were attacked while touring the area in an armored car. None were injured. A Palestinian security official in the city said one of the settlers kicked the car after trying to open one of its doors. Tension often runs high in Hebron, home to 180,000 Palestinians and around 650 Jewish settlers who live in fortified enclaves guarded by Israeli troops. Diplomats regularly visit the flashpoint city to assess security conditions and the role of settlers. The British diplomats were taking part in a tour by a group called "Breaking the Silence". Tours by the group, led by former Israeli soldiers, are often attacked by some settlers who see them as siding with the Palestinians. The British consulate said Israeli police intervened after the attack and an investigation was under way. The Israeli government had no immediate comment
