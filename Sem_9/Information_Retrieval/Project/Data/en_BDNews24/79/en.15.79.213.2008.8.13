 Dhaka Aug 13 (bdnews24.com)  Chairman of the Truth and Accountability Commission, Justice Habibur Rahman Khan, said Wednesday that 17 to 18 peopleincluding politicians, bureaucrats and businessmenhad so far voluntarily applied to the commission seeking clemency. In a weekly press briefing at the commission's office, Justice Khan said that the truth commission is working with a view to maintaining social and economic stability. "The commission's prime responsibility is to provide alternative ways to the judicial system," he said. The TAC chairman expressed the hope that the response would be greater in the coming weeks than the initial response commission received since its launch on Aug 3. He told reporters that after filling in a form, the person concerned would be invited to give their statement on a particular date. The commission chief said people from different professions had sought information about the commission. "Some are asking over the telephone and some are coming to the office directly." He stressed that personal details of those enquiring about or seeking clemency would remain confidential and would not do anything which lowers the esteem of anyone. "We will not be trying anyone in the dock. But anyone can seek the help of a lawyer," the former judge said. "Depending on the situation, the person can give his statement either sitting or standing," he said in reply to a query. Retired major general and member of the commission, Manzur Rashid Khan was also present at the briefing. The former general said the Anticorruption Commission would send relevant files, the investigation of which were completed, to the truth commission and that neither the ACC nor the court would not take any action in any case while it was under consideration by the truth commission. Manzur added that the commission was expected to begin their work this month. bdnew
