 Tripoli, Lebanon, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A bomb targeted a bus in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli on Wednesday, killing at least nine people, including seven soldiers when it exploded in a busy square, security sources said. At least seven more people were wounded by the bomb, which was planted either inside the civilian bus, or just by it. Lebanese security forces fought Islamist militants in Tripoli last year at the start of a insurrection by the al Qaeda-inspired Fatah al-Islam group, which was based at the nearby Nahr al-Bared Palestinian refugee camp. The army lost 170 soldiers in the fighting.
