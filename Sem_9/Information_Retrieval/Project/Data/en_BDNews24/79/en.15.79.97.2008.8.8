 QINGDAO, China, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Olympic sailing regatta will start in light winds on Saturday with the breeze picking up early next week, American team meteorologist Jennifer Lilly said on Friday. Strong tides and light winds are a feature of this stretch of coastline in August and Olympic sailors having long been preparing for such conditions. "What we have been seeing is normal climatic conditions this month," Lilly told Reuters. "Hot, hazy, humid days with weak sea breeze conditions." Practice racing was abandoned at the Olympic Sailing Centre on Thursday on a calm day in Qingdao following several days of moderate breeze. Lilly said Monday and Tuesday could be "more interesting". "There is an area of low pressure to the south and we may get a stronger breeze," she said. The Finn and Yngling fleets get the sailing competition underway on Saturday with two races scheduled in each class. The competition runs through to Aug. 21, with two reserve days set aside
