 Dhaka, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com)Adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said Thursday he hoped that the EU would rethink its position on observing elections amid a state of emergency, in response to a statement by a visiting European member of parliament. European Parliament's lawmaker Nirj Deva told reporters Wednesday that the European Union observers did not observe any election held amid a state of emergency, and the EU backed a total lift of the emergency in Bangladesh ahead of national elections. Adviser Hossain Zillur told reporters after a meeting at the commerce ministry: "We hope the EU decision will be based on the ground realities, and not just rely on what is on paper." He agreed that, according to the legal framework of the EU, there were legal bars on sending observers amid the state of emergency. "They highlighted this in their meeting with different political parties," he said. "But, they did not mention it in their talks with the government at different levels." Hossain Zillur said the EU had seen that the state of emergency was relaxed prior to the recent local elections, and there had been no hindrances to the election campaigning of the candidates. He added that a UK minister had made positive comments having seen the real situation. "So, whatever decision we take, we would present the reality to the EU. If we can properly present our situation, they might accept it," the adviser said. bdnews 2
