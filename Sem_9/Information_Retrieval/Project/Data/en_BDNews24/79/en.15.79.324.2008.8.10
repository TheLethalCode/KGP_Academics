 Dhaka, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh broke new ground in the WTO negotiations on zero-duty and quota-free access for local goods into US and exploring new markets, the commerce adviser said on Sunday. "Many countries have given us duty and quota-free access, but the US has not. Bangladesh strongly presented its case. When it was proposed that the facility should be provided to non-LDC countries Pakistan and Sri LankaBangladesh demanded the facility as a LDC country," Hossain Zillur Rahman said at a press briefing. "In the face of the demand it had been decided that "commercially meaningful market facility" in the form of duty and quota-free access would be extended to Bangladesh, Nepal and Cambodia." Hossain Zillur said an attempt was made at the July meeting in Geneva to open a rift between the LDC countries of Africa and Asia. "But we succeeded in making the African countries understand (what was being tried). We assured them of giving concession in duty and quota-free access to some of their commodities, if necessary. However, he said, bilateral talks would have to be continued to realise the pledges Bangladesh had received. Members of the delegation that joined the WTO meeting  WTO cell Director General Amitabh Chakrabarti, CPD executive director Dr Mustafizur Rahman, CEO of Bangladesh Foreign Trade Institute MA Taslim, BGMEA president Anwarul Alam Chowdhury Parvez  were present in the press conference. The adviser said, "All will have to do their bits to expand trade in internal and international arena and ensure political stability at home. We hope good sense will prevail over everyone." Asked with the government's tenure ending in December how it would tackle the twin task of bilateral dialogue and electoral preparation, the adviser said, "We are aware of our responsibility." "A government has to do many things at a time. If any government fails to do so it cannot be called a government. We are also trying to do all the tasks in hand. I think we are going ahead." bdne
