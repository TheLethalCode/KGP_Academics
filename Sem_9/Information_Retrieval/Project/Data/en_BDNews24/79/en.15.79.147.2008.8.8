<TEXT>
 LONDON, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)- Kevin Pietersen celebrated his first innings as England captain with a century on Friday, steering his side to a first-innings lead on the second day of the fourth Test at The Oval. The swashbuckling Pietersen, five days into the skipper's job, rode his luck and was dropped twice but played commanding and composed shots before falling two balls after reaching 100, to Makhaya Ntini, who has captured all four England wickets. At tea England were 38 ahead of South Africa, who were bowled out on Thursday for 194. South African-born Pietersen, who took over as skipper from Michael Vaughan last Monday after South Africa had clinched the series at Edgbaston, came to the crease in the first over of the day after Ntini had Ian Bell caught at slip for 24. He put on 60 with Alastair Cook before the opener was caught behind just before tea for 39. Ntini, who on Thursday evening had captured England opener Andrew Strauss, had little luck after lunch. He ran for a Pietersen miscued shot ahead of team mate Paul Harris, who was closer but failed to hold on at deep square leg with the batsman on 61. After a brief break for bad light, Pietersen again sent a ball high to the boundary and Ntini put down a difficult running chance over his shoulder. Otherwise Pietersen, only the third England captain to score a century in his first innings in the job after Archie MacLaren in 1897 and Allan Lamb in 1990, played a measured innings, punishing loose balls and stroking all bowlers round the ground. Keen to salvage some pride from the dead rubber, he put on 108 for the fourth wicket with Paul Collingwood, who was 49 not out at tea. Andrew Flintoff came to the crease after Pietersen departed and hit a straight six down the ground to make his intentions known. Flintoff, plagued by injury for much of the year, went into tea on nine. Ntini had figures of four for 74 off 19 over
