<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com) Dhaka Medical College authorities in a report submitted to the High Court have said that the seven much talked about 'children' of a former DIG of police, Anisur Rahman, are not siblings. A High Court bench of Justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Farid Ahmed after reading the DNA sibling test report of the seven children on Tuesday fixed Wednesday to issue a ruling in this regard. The High Court on Aug 6 ordered Dhaka Medical College authorities to conduct a DNA test of the seven children. Dr Sharif Aktaruzzaman, head of the DNA lab of the DMC Forensic Department, said: "In the test, it was found that the children were not siblings." "In a separate Y-chromosome test on the four boys, it was also found the four did not share the same father," he said. While giving order, the High Court said that the test was necessary to determine whether the children were siblings. The order mentioned that if necessary an order would later be given for DNA testing of Anisur Rahman and his wife Anwara Begum. The same day, Aug 6, a three-member medical team led by Dhaka Medical College Forensic Department head, Dr Mizanul Haque, conducted the test on the seven children. Dhaka Medical College Medical Board submitted the test report Tuesday to the High Court through the Supreme Court registrar. The court opened the sealed medical board report, read it and said that according to the report, the seven children of former DIG Anisur Rahman were not siblings, their DNAs were dissimilar and they did not share the same parents. As per the DNA and the Y-chromosome tests, the paternity claim of the former DIG was false, the report said. Executive director of the Bangladesh Society for Enforcement of Human Rights (BSEHR) Elina Khan disclosing the information to journalists said that the court had read the report and would issue order in this regard Wednesday. Reports in the media in May 2006 about the wife of a former DIG claiming to be the mother of seven children of similar age created a public sensation at the time. The seven children were named Jannatul Mariam, Ayman Rahman Anis, Anas Rahman Akhand, Nafis Rahman Nice, Diyan Rahman, Jannatul Nafiza Rahman and Jannatul Anisa Rahman. As the incident raised suspicion, BSEHR on June 2, 2006, filed a general diary with Badda police, based on which, the police sought permission from the court to investigate the incident. Later on June 7, 2006, BSEHR filed another GD with Badda police for a ban on the former DIG leaving the country. On the day, Badda police sought permission from Dhaka CMM Court to conduct DNA testing of the children. The next day, BSEHR also petitioned the court for conducting the DNA tests and the court granted permission. Later, a medical board was formed with the then head of Dhaka Medical College Forensic Department Prof Akhteruzzaman as its chief. But the DNA testing could not be conducted as Anwara Rahman was not present on the day scheduled for the test. National Women Lawyers Association on June 18, 2006, filed a writ petition for custody of the seven children. Anisur Rahman, meanwhile, sought permission for conducting the DNA tesing of the children in Singapore. Between this writ petition and a counter writ petition, the High Court eventually gave permission to conduct the DNA tests in Singapore. The two human rights organisations, BSEHR and NWLA, filed two appeals against the order. The Appellate Division on June 29, 2006 sent the matter back to High Court again. bdnews24
