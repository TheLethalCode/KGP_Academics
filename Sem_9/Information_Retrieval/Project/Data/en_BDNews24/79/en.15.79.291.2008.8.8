 BEIJING, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The range of skills needed in hockey now is far greater than ever and is the reason why former powerhouses India and Pakistan have fallen behind, according to Barry Dancer, coach of Olympic champions Australia. "We have players with more all-round technical ability now. So it's not just the physical improvement, it's the technical improvement," men's coach Dancer told Reuters on Thursday. Pakistan men qualified for the Beijing Games on a quota ticket while their Asian neighbours, eight-times champions India, will miss the games for the first time in 80 years. While Pakistan hockey has declined in the past decade, India's slide coincided with the game's switch to astroturf in the mid 1970s. South Korea have emerged as the new force in Asia and are a medal contender at Beijing. Their style is more European, relying on power, speed and accuracy more than deft stickwork. "Korea, one of the top five teams in the world, has improved their ability, overtaken Pakistan and India," Dancer said of the Asian Games champions. Australia is number one in the current world rankings, followed by world champions Germany, The Netherlands, Spain, Korea and Argentina. "I think they (Korea) have a very concentrated programme, full-time athletes and have benefited from sports science import and as well as local training," the Australian said. "I think that's the main reason why they have improved over the last 10 years.
