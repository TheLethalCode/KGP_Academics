 Dhaka, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com)--Ericsson has launched a pilot project in Bangladesh to exhibit how use of high speed internet services with 3G/HSPA technology can improve productivity and quality of life. The launch of the project titled 'Alokito Bangladesh' was held Sunday at the city's Westin Hotel. 3G is the third generation of mobile phone standards and technology, superseding 2G, and preceding 4G. It enables network operators to offer users a wider range of more advanced services like video calls, television and on-demand video along with hi-speed broadband internet and data transmission, all in a mobile environment. Special assistant to chief adviser for post and telecommunication MA Malek attended Sunday's programme as chief guest, while retired major general Manzurul Alam, chairman of Bangladesh Telecommunications Regulatory Commission, was special guest. The special assistant said 3G technology would help cut poverty as it would facilitate the proliferation of e-commerce through high-speed mobile internet. "The initiative would help the government to formulate the guidelines for licensing 3G technology," he added. BTRC chief Manzurul Alam said he believed 3G would bridge the gap between the 'have and have not' of the country. "BTRC is striving relentlessly to introduce affordable new technology services that benefit the Bangladeshi people." He said BTRC welcomed all initiatives that work towards revealing opportunities to build a modern and affordable ICT portfolio for Bangladeshi consumers. Managing director of Ericsson Bangladesh, Arun Bansal, said the project would showcase how an efficient and affordable 3G/HSPA broadband services could help serve as a blueprint for widespread introduction of internet connectivity. Ericsson is conducting the 3G trial by using the networks of Warid Telecom, Grameen Phone and Aktel. Jahangir Nagar University School and Apollo Hospital are Ericsson's partners for E-learning and E-medicine. Ericsson, a leading provider of technology and services to telecom operators, runs 167 networks in more than 100 countries. bd
