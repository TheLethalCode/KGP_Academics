 Dhaka, August 12 (bdnews24.com)Home adviser MA Matin said Tuesday that a court order, requiring Sheikh Hasina to appear for charge framing in the MiG-29 graft case, would have to be examined before the next step is taken in this regard. Dhaka Divisional Special Judge's Court had earlier in the day ordered all accused, including former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, to be present for charge framing in the case on Aug 20. The adviser, replying to reporter queries outside the home ministry, said: "Sheikh Hasina's parole has been extended up to September 6." "After the court order reaches all concerned, it will be reviewed and its legal aspects will be examined, and the next necessary step duly taken." The AL president and former prime minister was granted eight weeks' temporary release on June 11, to seek treatment abroad. She left for the US the day after. The government extended her release order on Aug 5, by another four weeks. bdnews24.
