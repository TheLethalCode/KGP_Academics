<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com)  A BNP leader on Sunday said the government has bias against the release of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia and her elder son Tarique Rahman. "The government advisers are saying that her release is 'at final stages'. But the party is not being informed about the matter," BNP office secretary Rizvi Ahmed told reporters at the house of BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain. "Tarique Rahman is being forced to spend his last days in hospital because of the government's bias." Tarique is currently being held at the prison cell of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital. Rizvi asked the government why it was not taking any steps even though the High Court had advised that Tarique be sent abroad for better medical treatment. Rizvi also came down hard on the government for failing to curb commodity prices and demanded subsidy programmes to be put in place. "The country is witnessing a silent famine. But the government does not have any programme to get over the situation," he said. Earlier in the day, thousands of leaders and activists of BNP and its front organisations thronged in front of the special jail on the Sangsad Bhaban complex, from around 11am to 1pm, on hearing rumours that Khaleda would be released around midday. bdnew
