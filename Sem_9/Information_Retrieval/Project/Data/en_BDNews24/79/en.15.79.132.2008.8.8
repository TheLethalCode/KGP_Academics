<TITLE> Mbeki to meet Zimbabwe political leaders </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 HARARE, Aug 08 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South African President Thabo Mbeki, mediating in Zimbabwe's post-election crisis, will go there on Saturday amid growing optimism for progress in power-sharing talks. A statement from South Africa's Foreign Ministry said Mbeki would meet presidents of Zimbabwean political parties. President Robert Mugabe's ZANU-PF and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change began talking more than two weeks ago to resolve a crisis that came to a head after the 84-year-old Mugabe was re-elected in a widely condemned June poll boycotted by the opposition. South Africa's Business Day newspaper, citing unnamed sources, said Mugabe and opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai would hold make-or-break talks to finalize a deal in Harare on Sunday. Business Day said it was understood the two were not "too far apart", though the central issues remain unresolved. Mugabe said on Thursday the talks were going well but dismissed media reports about a draft agreement as nonsense. Business Day said Mugabe, in power since 1980, and Tsvangirai were said to have been in contact several times during the talks to seek common ground on the delicate issue of power and positions. The two sides are under heavy international pressure to resolve a deepening crisis that has ruined the once prosperous economy and flooded neighboring states with millions of refugees. DOUBTS REMAIN But political analyst Steven Friedman, of the University of Johannesburg, had serious doubts that ZANU-PF and the MDC were close to a deal. "The reality is that you've got a military establishment and I think they are really running things," he told Reuters. "You've got a military establishment which I think believes it has the power to crush resistance. It had the power to ensure there wasn't a free and fair election." Should an agreement be reached, it could take at least two weeks to convene parliament and push through expected constitutional changes creating new government posts and implement other aspects of the deal, analysts say. Even if the two sides manage to settle their differences, investors should remain cautious, said Graham Stock, sub-Saharan Africa strategist for JP Morgan in London. Firm evidence of international backing for any deal should not be the sole basis for financial commitments, he argued. "Handing over power to Morgan Tsvangirai will not be enough. It will take more than that to provide guarantees on property rights and other macro-economic issues," Stock told Reuters. Helping secure a settlement before he hosts an August 16 summit in South Africa of regional leaders he has represented in the mediation could be a political coup for Mbeki. Mbeki has come under intense criticism at home and abroad for not taking a tough line with Mugabe, a policy he argues would only backfire and deepen tensions. The Star, a South African newspaper, said on Wednesday that under a draft accord, Tsvangirai would run the country as prime minister while Mugabe would become ceremonial president. South African mediators, it said, had met Zimbabwean security chiefs, seen as key to any resolution. Any deal would require a green light from security and military chiefs, powerful figures with wide sway over Mugabe who want to make sure they are not vulnerable to international prosecution when the political dust settles, analysts say. "It's just too good to be true," Friedman said. "You don't go from a situation where two or three weeks ago people were being killed in the streets for being MDC, then three weeks later you have a nice power-sharing agreement in which everybody agrees to work with each other."
