<TITLE> Tainted sports face 'moral bankruptcy' - WADA </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIJING, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sports tainted by doping scandals are at risk of "moral bankruptcy" if positive tests continue to emerge, the head of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) said on Thursday. John Fahey said high-profile drugs scandals like those of Olympic gold medal-winning athletes Ben Johnson and Marion Jones could turn viewers and sponsors away from certain sports. "There is suspicion out there in the public, they don't have the confidence they once had," Fahey told a news conference. "If we don't (tackle doping), part of the world will leave us because the public will desert any sport, any time, if they are not satisfied it has integrity." European broadcasters two months ago threatened to significantly reduce their coverage of sports events if federations did not offer "maximum guarantees" in the fight against doping. The warning came after this year's Tour de France was again tainted by drugs. Fahey, who replaced Dick Pound as WADA chief last year, said he hoped a clean Olympics would restore public confidence. "Sport is at risk of dwindling, which unltimatly means support will wither as the public marches with their feet and walks away," he added. "I hope we walk away from here seeing results that made these Games a significant step in the road back towards confidence and integrity in sport.
