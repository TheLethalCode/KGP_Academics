 BRUSSELS, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Negotiators failed on Tuesday to reach a deal to end a strike by baggage handlers at Brussels Airport, Brussels airport spokesman Jan Van der Cruysse said. Baggage handlers started a 24-hour strike on Sunday evening but as the walkout stretched beyond that deadline, the industrial action over pay and working conditions has sparked chaos and left thousands of passengers stranded. "Unions have rejected management's proposal so the strike will continue," Van der Cruysse told Reuters. He added that a very limited number of flights, mainly long-distance, were taking off and those with severe delays. Thousands of travelers are affected by the strike as most flights in and out of the airport are cancelled, delayed or diverted. Some 20,000 pieces of luggage have already piled up at arrivals and with little hope for a deal later on Tuesday, the backlog looks set to become even bigger, he said. The strike reignited a debate among Belgian politicians whether there is a need for legislation to ensure minimum services are maintained during strikes. Belgian State Secretary for Mobility Etienne Schouppe told Belgian daily De Standaard he will look into such a measure, but stressed he favors a voluntary agreement under which unions would pledge not to go on strike unannounced. Above all, Schouppe wants more competition for Aviapartner and Flightcare, the two main luggage handlers at Brussels airport.
