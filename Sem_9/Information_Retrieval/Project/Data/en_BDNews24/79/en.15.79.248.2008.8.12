<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 12 (bdnews24.com) - The link road connecting Bijoy Swarani with Tejgaon will be opened for traffic on Dec 16, a government official said Tuesday. "For this, the demolition of Rangs Bhaban will be completed by November," said housing and public works secretary ASM Rashidul Hai. Hai informed reporters, after visiting the site, about the progress of the demolition work and construction of link road. "The major portion of the demolition work is done. To expedite the rest of the demolition work, RAJUK has imported machinery." Rashidul Hai said a total of 23 buildings will have to come down for the construction of the new link road. "We have already demolished nine buildings. Five more buildings will have to be knocked down by August 20. But there are court cases against demolition of nine others." "We hope the court will not give any ruling that may hamper the government's good initiative." He brushed aside any allegations of changing the original plan to save a 'particular building' from demolition. "This is not true. The plan has been changed to reduce the construction costs, not to favour any special quarter." "The government has to compensate for demolishing each and every private building. If the road is made on government land then the cost can be reduced," he said. bdnews
