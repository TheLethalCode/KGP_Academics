<TITLE> Prices will fall in Ramadan: Wholesalers </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com)Wholesalers on Thursday said prices of essential commodities will not rise further during Ramadan amid admission by the FBCCI that syndicates indeed control market. The declaration came from a meeting of the price monitoring cell of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industries, which was meant to find out ways to keep prices stable during the month of fasting. FBCCI director Kamaluddin Ahmed, who heads the price monitoring cell, admitted to reporters that there were some syndicates that control market prices. "There are syndicates but in a very limited manner," he said. Wholesale businessmen, however, denied any syndication. "I challenge that there is no such syndicate; it's all cock and bull story of the media," Golam Moula, a trader of Moulavibazar, said. The meeting chaired by FBCCI president Annisul Huq was attended by representatives of the chambers of commerce and industries from different districts, importers and wholesale businessmen. The chambers agreed that they would open at least one fair price shop in each district to help out the public. The meeting stressed strict price monitoring, adequate supply of goods, cut on duty, withdrawal of VAT during Ramadan and involving retailers in the process to keep prices stable. Edible oil businessmen assured prices would come down in the wake of low prices in the international market. Kazi Slahuddin Ahmed of S Alam Group that imports sugar and oil said prices would fall in Ramadan and would not say how much. "I cannot say it now. We just can't fix a price without consulting the other players in the industry," he said. Anisul Huq said the trade body can only help find out ways to keep prices stable. "We have to remember the FBCCI is not a regulatory body. All we can do is give direction and create awareness." He stressed stern supervision over retail markets. "Its a tough job but not impossible." The FBCCI's price monitoring cell launched a website at the meeting to make available daily market price updates. "Even the government agencies lack accurate information on the demand-supply of essential commodities. This website would help address the deficiency," said Kamaluddin Ahmed. He asked representatives from different districts to provide price information to make this initiative a success. The address of the site is www.fbcci-bd.org/marketprice. bd
