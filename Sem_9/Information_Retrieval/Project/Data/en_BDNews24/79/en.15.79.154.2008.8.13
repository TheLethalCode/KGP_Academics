<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Wednesday bailed Chittagong mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury, HRC Group chairman Sayeed Hossain Chowdhury and former BNP lawmaker Monjurul Ahsan Munshi in three separate cases. However, the Appellate Division chamber judge stayed the bail of Pro-Awami League Bangladesh Jubo League general secretary Mirza Azam for one month. The High Court had granted him a three-month bail in a graft case involving amassing of illegal wealth. The High Court bench of justices Khademul Islam Chowdhury and Mashuk Hossain Ahmed approved a three-month bail to mayor Mohiuddin in a case on charges of ill-gotten wealth. The court also asked the government and the Anticorruption Commission to explain why the case would not be scrapped. Barrister Amir-ul-Islam stood for Mohiuddin while advocate Khurshid Alam Khan represented the ACC. The graft watchdog filed the case on Dec 2 last year with Double Mooring Police Station in Chittagong against Mohiuddin and his wife Hasina Mohiuddin on charges of acquiring wealth of Tk 3.83 crore beyond declared earnings. The bench of justices Sharifuddin Chaklader and Md Imdadul Haque Azad allowed ad-interim bail to Sayeed for three months in a money laundering case. The court also asked the government to explain in four weeks why the HRC chairman would not be given permanent bail. The same bench gave a six-month bail to Monjurul Ahsan Munshi in an extortion case and asked the government to explain why Munshi would not be given permanent bail. Mahbubur Rahman stood for Sayeed in the hearing and barrister Rafikul Islam Miah for Munshi. bdne
