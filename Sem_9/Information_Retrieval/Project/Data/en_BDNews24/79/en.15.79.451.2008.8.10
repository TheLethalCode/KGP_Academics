 Kurigram, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com)- National Board of Revenue (NBR) chairman Mohammad Abdul Mazid on Sunday said better mobilisation of internal resources could reduce the heavy weight of foreign loan. "This country belongs to all of us. We liberated this country through a lot of struggles and a war. So we all will have to protect the country together. We need to reduce the burden of foreign loan and for this mobilisation of internal resources has to be increased. "The number of new taxpayers has to be increased," the NBR chairman said at a motivational meeting at Kurigram Town Hall. "Every year we have to pay instalments on interests on foreign loan to the tune of Tk 14,000 crore. Making plans sitting in Dhaka will not help come out of this situation.
