<TEXT>
 COLOMBO, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Coach Trevor Bayliss paid tribute to Kumar Sangakkara for his unbeaten 107 that helped Sri Lanka take a small lead over India in the third test on Saturday. Sangakkara scored his 17th test century as Sri Lanka, replying to India's 249, closed on 251 for six. "It was a tough day of test cricket and tomorrow will be the same," Bayliss told reporters. "Obviously we'll be looking at getting as many runs in front as we possibly can and then bowl them out again," he added. "There's still a lot of hard work to be done in this match. "Sanga held the innings together all day. We needed someone to anchor the innings and that's exactly what he did today. "The concentration he shows batting for long periods of time is what makes him world class. He showed that out there today in difficult conditions," Bayliss said. Indian left-armer Zaheer Khan, who has taken two wickets for 57, said: "Sangakkara's innings was important today. "From their point of view they needed someone to hang in there and that's exactly what he did." Khan said the outcome of the match and the three-test series, which is level at 1-1, would depend on the first few hours of the third day on Sunday. "The game is evenly poised and the first session tomorrow will be crucial," he said. "We want to get them out as early as possible without them getting a big lead and then we have to bat really well so they have to bat last on the track.
