<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission (ACC) is ready to fully cooperate with the Truth and Accountability Commission (TAC) in its efforts, a senior ACC official said on Thursday. There is no scope of misunderstanding, ACC director general (administration) Col Hanif Iqbal said at a regular press briefing. He said barring those who have been handed down jail terms for two years or more in cases pursued by the commission, any other person is free to seek clemency from TAC. Iqbal said before TAC came into being two persons appealed to the ACC to seek clemency from it. Though their names were not disclosed for legal reasons, he said they were not politicians. The ACC official said they have gathered from surveys and from the people that corruption is taking place at the grassroots level in the shape of bribes. The ACC has decided to intensify 'trap case activities', where the rogue people are caught in the act, across the country, he said. Iqbal added they had approved in principle a proposal to reward those who will give information on exchange of bribes or help them catch the offenders red-handed. He said ACC has plans to take up massive publicity programme to encourage people about giving information on trap cases. bdne
