<TITLE> No confusion about Khaleda's release: Adviser </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com)  With contradictory statements swirling from the government about the release of former prime minister Khaleda Zia from prisons, an adviser on Tuesday said no confusion was there and if any, it was because of the media. Education adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman told journalists when asked about the statements from him and cabinet colleagues that "what is happening now is happening because of you". "We are going ahead with a plan, working on specific issues." "Two issues are involved here. One is political discussion; the other is issuing an administrative order. We are reviewing the nitty-gritty of ground realities for making decisions. In this case, the time taken is logical." About government's reaction on Khaleda Zia's refusal to register as a voter, the adviser said everything would be settled after reaching an agreement. BNP leaders have said the contradictory comments made by the advisers were, at best, misleading. Some of the advisers spoke to reporters on the issue on returning from Chief Adviser's Office. Home adviser MA Matin, whose ministry issues government orders on permanent or temporary release from jail, said: "I don't know anything about any development on Khaleda Zia's release." Echoing the home adviser, local government, rural development and cooperatives adviser M Anwarul Iqbal told reporters, "I don't have any news regarding Khaleda Zia's release." On the advisers' ignorance about the developments on Khaleda's release, Hossain Zillur said it was "at the final stages". "We are looking into it with due consideration." He and communication adviser Ghulam Quader recently said the BNP chief's release was "at the final stages". About reshuffle in the administration before the elections, he said, "We had a meeting with the chief adviser where we discussed how to initiate the process of transfer." "MISLEADING" BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, responding to differing comments by different advisers, told bdnews24.com Tuesday that these were misleading. "Khaleda Zia's release is people's demand. By ignoring the demand, some of the advisers of the government are making varied statements.'' Joint secretary general Goyeshwar Chandra Roy said, "We don't believe the statements of some of the talkative advisers." He said their statements were false, baseless and those carried little significance. Pro-reform BNP leader Hafiz Uddin Ahmed has also expressed concern about the delay in Khaleda's freedom. Khaleda was arrested on Sept 3 last year and has been confined to a house in the Sangsad Bhaban complex that was declared special jail. Her arch political rival Sheikh Hasina was kept in another special jail in the same complex before she was temporarily released on a government order on medical grounds. Khaleda's younger son Arafat Rahman Coco has also been freed and is now in Thailand for treatment while elder son Tarique Rahman is in prisons. They are standing trial on a slew of corruption charges after the military-backed interim government wrested power in January 2007. bdnews24.com/ahd/eh
