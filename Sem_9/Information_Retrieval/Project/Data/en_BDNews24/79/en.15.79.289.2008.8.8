 Bagerhat, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com) - Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mojaheed has again accused the government of violating the constitution. "This government came to power for 90 days and by staying for 18 months, it has been violating the constitution," Mojaheed said Friday at a meeting in Bagerhat at district Shilpakala Academy Friday afternoon. Mojaheed said this government did not have any success in its 18 months in power. He demanded immediate withdrawal of the state of emergency and release of four-party alliance leader Khaleda Zia. Mojaheed said, "When the four-party alliance took power, the per capita income of the country was $ 327 and it rose to $ 423 when it left power." During the alliance government rule, the GDP was 6.75 percent, but now it has dropped to 4.75 percent, he said. Mojaheed said the present government had failed to contain price spiral of essentials and increase people's purchase power. The Jamaat secretary general and former minister said during the rule of this government 1.5 crore people had become unemployed. He demanded publication of the source of the crores of taka spent on the road show across the country in the name of publicising the government's development and success. Representatives of Jamaat-e-Islami and Islami Chhatra Shibir from nine upazilas and three municipalities participated in the meeting. Bagerhat district Jamaat ameer Moshiur Rahman presided. Jamaat central leader and former MP Maulana Delwar Hossain Saidee, former MP Shah Mohammad Ruhul Quddus and former MP Principal Miah Golam Parwar were special guests. bdnews2
