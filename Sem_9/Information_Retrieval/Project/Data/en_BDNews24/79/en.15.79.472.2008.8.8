 SHENYANG, China, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazil coach Dunga, already upset about the food and training arrangements for his team, was complaining again on Thursday, this time about the pitch at the Shenyang Olympic stadium. After watching his side struggle to a 1-0 win over nine-man Belgium in their opening game, Dunga said the pitch had made life more difficult. "If the pitch had been better, it would have been a much better match, regardless of the opposition," he told reporters. "The ball bounces around all over the place and you need two or three touches to bring it under control." He also complained about the heat. "It was like a sauna and that makes it more difficult." Dunga is under intense pressure to do well after poor recent results with the senior team, which he also coaches. Ronaldinho, hoping to re-ignite his after a season of injury and fitness problems, said he was pleased Brazil had started with a win. "I haven't played an official football match for four months. Today is the first official game for me. I'm happy to return," said the Brazil captain, who has been included as an over-age player. "It was a complicated game with the heat and everything else, but I'm happy with the win. We have absolute confidence that we are going to get better during the competition.
