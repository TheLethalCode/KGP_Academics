<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com) - Awami League has opposed the government decision to deploy the army during the next elections, and giving them power of arrest. AL acting president Zillur Rahman said Friday: "Giving power of arrest to the army cannot be supported. We reject this decision. We demand cancellation of this provision." Speaking to reporters, after an exchange of views with Tarun League leaders at his Gulshan home Friday, Zillur said: "The people in rural areas fear the army." "Moreover the army is being given extra powers. If the army is deployed during the election, the turnout for voting will fall." Zillur Rahman claimed that nowhere in the world is the army given so much power. Demanding national elections ahead of all, Zillur Rahman said: "Our party president Sheikh Hasina has said no election is acceptable before the national elections." "We agree with her. We do not want any election before the parliament election. If the government decides to hold upazila polls first, Awami League will take steps evaluating the situation." Repeating AL's stance that it would not participate in the next elections under the state of emergency, he said: "There is no such situation prevailing in the country that the state of emergency should continue." "The government itself is saying that a peaceful and normal situation is prevailing. So why the need for the state of emergency?" "There should be no election under Emergency Powers Rules. If the election is held under emergency, Awami League will not participate in it." bdnews
