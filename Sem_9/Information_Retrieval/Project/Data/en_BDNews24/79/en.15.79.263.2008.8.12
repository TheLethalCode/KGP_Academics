 BEIJING, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China displayed patches of classical Asian hockey to run South Africa ragged in front of a boisterous home crowd in women's Olympic hockey on Tuesday. Combining fluid long passes with crafty stickwork and energetic set play, the hosts won 3-0 in pool A to stay on course for a semi-final berth. China, who finished fifth in the Athens Games, drew first blood in the sixth minute when Tang Chunling scored off a free hit, igniting celebrations among the partisan crowd. Speedy China scored again just before halftime after an earlier goal was disallowed due to dangerous play. Fu Baoring displayed superb reflexes in converting a rebound, showing just why the hosts are among the favourites to land a medal. Forward Song Quingling scored with a reverse hit after intermission to close out the scoring. South Africa put up a feisty fight to deny China, down to 10 following a yellow card suspension, further success. China coach Kim Chang Back said his side can do better. "Although I am satisfied with the result of the match, I am not satisfied with the contest," the South Korean told a news conference through an interpreter. China play top-ranked Netherlands next, and the coach said his girls will have to be sharper. "Our team members will have to put their skills to best use," he said. "Our team have some good advantages and merits and cohesion, and if the spectators give us a lot of strength by cheering for us there will be a good result." Argentina's path to the semi-finals from pool B appears shaky after the favourites were held to a draw by Britain while Australia stayed in contention with a 6-1 win over Spain. The Netherlands meet South Korea and defending champions Germany take on New Zealand in other second round matches later on Tuesday
