 Dhaka, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com)The High Court granted two months' interim bail to on Monday to Jubo League general secretary Mirza Azam. The court also suspended for four months the proceedings of the case filed against him by the Anticorruption Commission on charges of earning illegal wealth, and ordered the government and the ACC to show cause within four weeks as to why the proceedings of the case against him would not be quashed. A High Court bench of Justice Sharif Uddin Chaklader and Justice Md Imdadul Haque Azad gave the ruling on a plea by Mirza Azam for bail and for quashing the case. His lawyer, barrister Amirul Islam told reporters after the hearing: "Legally there is no case against Mirza Azam as the investigation was not completed within the specified time after filing the case against him." The ACC filed the case against Mirza Azam on Jan 10 with Ramna police on charges of earning illegal wealth and concealing wealth information. The High Court on July 14 ordered him to surrender to court within 10 days. He surrendered on July 16, seeking bail. The judge denied bail and ordered him to jail. bdnews24.co
