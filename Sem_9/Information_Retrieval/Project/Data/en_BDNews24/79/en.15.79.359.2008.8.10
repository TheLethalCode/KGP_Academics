 BEIJING (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - U.S. swimming sensation Michael Phelps demolished his own world record on Sunday to win the first of what he hopes will be an unprecedented eight golds in a single Olympics. His splash of speed lit up the Games, eclipsing worries over security, heat, air pollution and intolerance of dissent that marked the Olympic build-up and lingered into the first day. Listening to hip-hop on headphones as he walked to the blocks, Phelps went on to win the 400 meters individual medley at China's futuristic and full-to-capacity Water Cube. His time was 1.41 seconds quicker than a previous best he set just six weeks ago. He was watched by U.S. President George W. Bush and cheered by compatriots and thousands of Chinese. "I'm pretty happy with that  it was all adrenaline," said Phelps, calling a thumbs-up by Bush in the stands "pretty cool." Thunderstorms cleansed Beijing's smog-filled air on Sunday, forcing delays to the rowing and tennis but easing concerns health and performance could be affected by suffocating heat. Even if Phelps wins only half his eight race competitions, he will hold more Olympic gold medals than any other athlete. But the 23-year-old looks in great shape to at least match his six golds at Athens in 2004 and then beat Mark Spitz's 1972 record of seven wins at one Games. Australia's Stephanie Rice followed Phelps with a world record of her own by taking gold in the women's 400 individual medley. The U.S. broke the world record in the men's 100 freestyle relay heats. Phelps will be part of the team for Monday's final. China's foremost female athlete, Guo Jingjing, dubbed the supermodel of the springboard for her film star looks, warmed home crowd hearts with a smooth victory in the synchronized three-meter diving. Britain won their first gold of the Games in the women's cycling road race. Nicole Cooke triumphed in surprisingly cold, wet and slippery conditions on the route from Beijing's Forbidden City imperial palace complex to the Great Wall. The weather could not have been more different from the previous day when one-third of the men dropped out of the road race amid suffocating heat and humidity. More rain is forecast for Monday in a relief for athletes complaining of the heat. ATTACKS FAR AND NEAR In distant western China suspected Muslim separatists and suicide bombers launched a dozen attacks that left eight people dead in blasts and a subsequent shootout with police. It was the second set of deadly attacks in a week in restive Xinjiang, where China says militants are agitating for an independent homeland for the region's majority Muslim Uighurs. Wang Wei, secretary of the Beijing Games organizing committee, said Xinjiang militants "want to use the platform of the Olympics to amplify the effects" of their attacks. Xinjiang is more than 3,000 km (1,860 miles) from Beijing but Olympic organizers have said separatist groups are among the main threats to the Games. A tight security blanket around Beijing has been labeled oppressive by critics who see it as a clampdown to prevent potentially embarrassing protests. The 100,000 security force lining the roads and venues was unable to stop a Chinese man stabbing to death the father-in-law of the U.S. men's volleyball coach at a tourist spot on Saturday. The assailant then committed suicide. Organizers said the attack was a one-off and Beijing was still safe. The "devastated" American volleyball team won their opening match on Sunday against Venezuela without their coach Hugh McCutcheon. GEORGIAN, RUSSIAN SHOOTERS EMBRACE Georgia's team offered to quit the Games over the conflict with Russia in South Ossetia. But President Mikheil Saakashvili sent instructions to stay "in the best interests of the country." In a deliberate show of unity, Georgian shooter Nino Salukvadze hugged Russian rival Natalia Paderina after they took bronze and silver respectively in the 10-metre air pistol. "If the world were to draw any lessons from what I did there would never be any wars," Salukvadze said. "There should be no hatred among athletes and people." Bush met Chinese President Hu Jintao for talks said to include frank but private discussions on China's internationally criticized human rights record, including restrictions on the rights to worship. Bush had earlier attended a church service. The two will be at the basketball late on Sunday for a match that pits China and their 7ft 6in (2.286m) favorite Yao Ming, who plays for the Houston Rockets, against the United States who are still smarting from winning only bronze in Athens 2004. The match-up may be the most-seen sporting contest in China's histor
