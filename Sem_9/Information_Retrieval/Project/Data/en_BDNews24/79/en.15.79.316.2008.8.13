 Moskow/Tbilisi, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia and Georgia proclaimed a day of mourning on Wednesday for the dead in five days of fighting over separatist South Ossetia before difficult negotiations on the details of an EU-brokered peace plan. The breakaway region and adjacent areas of Georgia were reported quiet overnight after the warring sides signed up in principle to a six-point plan delivered on Tuesday by French President Nicolas Sarkozy. Agreement was clinched hours after Russian President Dmitry Medvedev ordered a halt to military operations in Russia's ex-Soviet neighbor. In Brussels, European Union foreign ministers will hear a report from France's Bernard Kouchner on the peace mission and are expected to endorse the plan for a ceasefire and a return to relative stability in the volatile region. In Moscow, flags flew at half mast for a day of mourning after the loss of life in fighting that erupted last week when Russia rolled tanks and troops into breakaway South Ossetia to halt a Georgian offensive to retake the separatist region. In and around South Ossetia's main town of Tskhinvali, occasional small-arms fire resounded but there were no major incidents on the frontline. The Interior Ministry said it was "relatively quiet." But persistent rumors circulated through the town, with unconfirmed reports of Russian tanks rolling towards the town of Gori, 25 kilometers (15 miles) south of Tskhinvali. Tens of thousands of Georgians rallied on Tuesday night to denounce the Russian operations, which included bombing raids against mainly military installations across the country. Russia was unbowed. "The aggressor has been punished and suffered great losses," the Russian daily Izvestiya declared on its front page. The EU-brokered peace plan, once approved in Brussels, would then provide the basis for a U.N. Security Council resolution. But analysts said Georgia may yet have to make painful concessions, having been routed on the battlefield and forced to concede precious ground in both South Ossetia and Abkhazia, a second separatist region to the west on the Black Sea. The self-styled president of Abkhazia said on Wednesday that the region had formally taken control of the disputed upper reaches of the Kodori gorge on the region's boundary with Georgia proper. The region's forces had pushed Georgian troops out of the area a day earlier. The West indicated it would call for a multinational peacekeeping force in place of the Russian-Georgian joint force, and a new process to settle disputes that have simmered since both regions broke away from Georgian rule in the early 1990s. "We don't yet have peace," Sarkozy told a news conference in Moscow on Tuesday alongside Medvedev. "But we have a provisional cessation of hostilities. And everyone should be aware that this is considerable progress." REPUTATION AT STAKE The United States, which has taken a back seat to EU efforts to end the conflict, has accused Russia of a heavy-handed and brutal offensive aimed at toppling Western ally Saakashvili. The United States on Tuesday cancelled a Pacific Ocean naval exercise set for next week involving Russia, Britain and France. "There is no way in good conscience that we could proceed with a joint naval exercise given the state of this crisis," a senior U.S. defense official said on the condition of anonymity. A senior official in Washington said events could weigh on Russia's bid for WTO and Organization for Economic Development and Cooperation membership, and its current presence in the Group of Eight industrialized nations. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Moscow's reputation and role in the international community "is very much at stake". A senior EU official in Brussels said foreign ministers were likely to tell Moscow its use of military force in Georgia would affect EU-Russian relations, without spelling out how. They will also consider how to send in more humanitarian aid. While some EU countries have called for European peacekeepers or monitors for Georgia's two rebel regions, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, there was no indication Russia, which has the upper hand militarily, would accept such a move. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov again questioned NATO's commitment to extend membership to Georgia, a move that has angered Moscow. "For decision-makers in the NATO countries of the west, it would be worth considering whether in future you want the men and women of your armed services to be answerable to Mr Saakashvili's declarations of war in the Caucasus," he told the Financial Times.
