<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has rejected Tarique Rahman's appeal to grant him bail and cancel Sabbir murder suppression case, his lawyer said. A High Court bench of Justice Sharifuddin Chaklader and Justice Imdadul Haque Azad gave the ruling Thursday. The court examined Tarique's medical report and was of the opinion that he be sent abroad for treatment. The court observed that the government had released former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and Awami League general secretary Abdul Jalil on parole to receive treatment abroad. Tarique's doctors have also suggested his treatment abroad and so, the court said, he can be sent outside for treatment on humanitarian grounds. The court observed that in a civilised country the opinion of the court is considered as order and it was up to the government if they would do so, Tarique's lawyer added.. Barrister Mahbubuddin Khokan, the lawyer, told journalists that the High Court advised sending Tarique abroad to save his life. "Earlier Sheikh Hasina and Abdul Jalil have been sent abroad. I hope the government will also send Tarique abroad in line with the court order." Earlier on Sunday, the court ordered the government and the Anticorruption Commission to present Tarique's medical report, but the government failed. Tarique on May 25 appealed to the High Court to cancel the case that charges him with suppressing the murder of Basundhara Group director Sabbir Ahmed and set him free on bail. The Anticorruption Commission pressed charges on May 6 against Tarique and former state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar and six others for taking Tk 21 crore in bribes to conceal the involvement of Bashundhara Group director Safiat Sobhan in the murder of another director Humayun Kabir Sabbir. Sabbir was murdered in 2006 and a case was filed three days later with Gulshan Police Station. bdne
