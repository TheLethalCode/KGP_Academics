<TITLE> Jankovic getting greedy on return to fitness </TITLE>

 BEIJING, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serb Jelena Jankovic, fit again ahead of schedule following a knee injury, could be accused of getting a bit greedy. The 23-year-old becomes the new world number one on Monday and hopes to add an Olympic gold medal five days later before turning her attention to the U.S. Open. All this after injury threatened to ruin her season. Following a shock fourth-round defeat at Wimbledon by Thailand's Tamarine Tanasugarn her physio told her the torn meniscus in her knee would keep her out for at least two months. Three weeks later she was back on court and reached the semi-finals in Los Angeles. A quarter-final appearance in Montreal last week earned her enough points to dislodge fellow Serb Ana Ivanovic when the new list is published. "I'm very proud that I'm becoming number one on Monday, despite having a really tough year with injuries so far and illness," Jankovic told reporters on Thursday after a practice session in stifling humidity at the Olympic Tennis Centre. "It was my childhood dream to achieve the number one ranking. Finally I've joined that selection of great champions. There are only 18 who have made it number one, not many girls have done it in the history of tennis." Despite her impending top ranking, Jankovic is yet to reach a grand slam final, losing in four semis. An Olympic gold would go some way to justifying her top spot although it is the U.S. title she really craves. "To be honest I would like to win the U.S. Open more (than the Olympics) although I would love to win them both," she said. "Both are quite special. I would love to win a medal. Winning a medal is pride for your country and a different feeling, you can't compare it to a grand slam." With Ivanovic and Jankovic seeded one and two in the women's singles and Novak Djokovic number three in the men's, Serbian eyes will be focused on the tennis courts for medals. Jankovic thinks a golden double is not out of the question. "I think there is a chance," she said. "We will see how we compete next week and I hope for all the best for Serbia." Jankovic faces Zimbabwe's Cara Black in the first round of the tournament which starts on Sunday
