 Dhaka, August 12 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court Tuesday sentenced Orion Group boss Obaidul Karim to five years in prison for money laundering. Judge Md Ashraf Hossain, of Special Judge's Court-5 set up in the Sangsad Bhaban area, handed down the verdict Tuesday and also fined Obaidul Tk 2 crore or another year in prison on failure to pay the fine. Former Awami League lawmaker AHM Mustafa Kamal ('Lotus' Kamal) and Lotus general manager ABM Selim, two other accused in the case, were acquitted as no charges could be substantiated against them. The Anticorruption Commission filed the money laundering case on Oct 7, 2007 with Gulshan police accusing Obaid, Kamal and Selim of laundering Tk 2 crore. The court on Tuesday ordered confiscation of the Tk 2 crore involved. Obaidul's sentence will be effective from the day of his surrender or arrest, as he is currently fugitive in the case. The Orion Group chairman already faces life imprisonment for embezzlement of around Tk 7 crore from Oriental Bank, as well as additional prison terms in a number of separate convictions against him. The court has ordered the release of Lotus Kamal if there were no other cases filed against him. bdnews24.
