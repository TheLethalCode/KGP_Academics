<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 11 (bdnews24.com)  The British High Commissioner in Dhaka, Stephen Evans, says he believes the state of emergency will gradually be lifted by the time the Jatiya Sangsad polls are due. The British envoy spoke to reporters Monday, emerging from a meeting with home adviser M A Matin at his secretariat office. Evans evaded a direct answer to query whether his country would continue to support the current caretakers if national polls were held under emergency. "... the query is based on surmises .. I'd say that the Chief Adviser has already declared that the emergency will be lifted in phases and we do hope that it'll be so before the elections," the high commissioner said. "The international communities have pledged to provide support to the CG during the December elections and the CA has, in the meantime, assured the emergency will be lifted." The envoy said his meeting with the home adviser focused on British assistance for Bangladesh's transition to democracy. He said the meeting also discussed different development projects and Bangladesh's climate strategies. The home adviser, however, didn't speak about the meeting.
