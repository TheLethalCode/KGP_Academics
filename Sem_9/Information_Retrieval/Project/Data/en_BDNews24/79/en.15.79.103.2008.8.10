<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 10 (bdnew24.com)  The Awami League on Sunday asked the government not to decide on the political future of mayors-elect without sitting with the party that now has people's mandate. "People are now by the side of Awami League. The days of making unilateral decisions are over. In future all decisions have to be taken in consultation with Awami League," acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam said. "The Awami League has now five flags. People are now by the side of the Awami League" was how he reacted to questions on the impending government decision that the elected city corporation and municipal mayors would have to give up their party posts. Ashraful spoke to reporters after a meeting of the AL's policymaking presidium with the members of the secretariat at AL president's political office at Dhanmondi. "In future all decision will have to be taken in consultation with the Awami League. The government will have to make decisions keeping the fact in mind." AL leaders have been elected mayors of Chittagong, Sylhet, Rajshahi, Khulna and Barisal city corporations in the Aug 4 polls. He said AL-backed mayors would take the government to court if it decided unilaterally on the issue. He also demanded that the interim administration lift emergency which stopped the party from holding conferences in 11 organisational districts units. "No conference of the party could be held in 11 districts due to the state of emergency. Though the government has allowed indoor politics it has attached some conditions. "That is why the conferences could not be held. As soon as the state of emergency is lifted the 11 districts will hold conferences." He asked for national elections before all other voting. The meeting that started at 11am and ran through to 2:30pm was also attended by joint secretaries and organising secretaries. He said the party revoked a directive given when Mukul Bose was the acting general secretary that suspended activities of Sunamganj district AL. He also said the meeting vetted the district committees without organisational problems and that they would approve those with problems after discussion with the organising secretaries. Later, office secretary Abdul Mannan clarified to bdnews24.com they decided in principle to approve of the committees that held conference, but approval had not yet been given. "It is a continuous process. The names of the districts cannot be disclosed at the moment. More meetings will be held with the organising secretaries before a final decision is taken," Mannan said. Ashraful said a number of district and thana committee members have been relieved of their posts and cannot stage a comeback before the next conference. He said such meetings will continue from August 15 until the general elections to prepare the party for the all-important ballot. AL presidium members Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, Amir Hossain Amu, Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed, Suranjit Sengupta and Motia Chowdhury, Ashraful himself, joint general secretary Mukul Bose, organising secretaries Saber Hossain Chowdhury, Abdul Mannan, Mahmudur Rahman Manna, Akhteruzzaman, Sultan Mohammad Monsur Ahmed and Abdur Rahman were present. bdnew
