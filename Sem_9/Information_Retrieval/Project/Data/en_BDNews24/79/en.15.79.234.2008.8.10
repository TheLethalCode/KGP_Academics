<TITLE> Pay hike beckons knitwear workers </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com)  Knitwear manufacturers have announced a pay rise for workers equating to 20 percent of their basic salary to help them keep up with the surging food prices, but said the gesture still needed the government's go-ahead. Fazlul Hoque, president of Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers' and Exporters' Association, made the announcement from a press conference at the association's office at Sonargaon Road in the city on Saturday. The BKMEA board made the decision at a meeting, said Hoque, adding that the decision would take effect only after the government approved of the move. "BKMEA will submit a proposal recommending the pay rise to the government and over 1,500 factory owners will implement it once the government clears it," Hoque said. "We alone cannot make a decision on the pay rise. The government would take a final decision on the matter in line with the labour law," the BKMEA leader added. Hoque said the association had also decided to open shops to sell daily essentials at subsidised prices in Narayanganj, Savar and Gazipur for workers during Ramadan. "About eight lakh workers of the knitwear industry have been leading miserable life in the wake of abnormal hike in commodity prices," Hoque said. The BKMEA opened such shops in Narayanganj in May and ran them until July 15. Hoque said the shops were closed on the assumption that the rice price would come down with Boro harvest. "This time we have decided to open shops on a large scale ahead of Ramadan as the rice price did not ease," he said. Three shops would be opened in Narayanganj, one in Savar and one in Gazipur which would sell commodities at lower prices than in BDR-run shops. The BKMEA chief said a shop might be opened in Chittagong, too. In the last fiscal year, the knitwear sector fetched $5.53 billion in export earnings, $365 million more than the oven sector did. Hoque said production in the knitwear sector has been hamstrung by gas and power crises. "If the problems are not solved, the sector will not grow further," he said. The government set the minimum wage for a knitwear operator at Tk 1,662 a month, with the basic salary at Tk 1,125. bdnews
