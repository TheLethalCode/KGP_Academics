 Dhaka, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com)  Communist Party of Bangladesh chief Manjurul Ahsan Khan said on Thursday the interim administration was not doing anything good and the country was headed for a "fascist system and police state". "Freedom of media and freedom of expression are stifled in an emergency. People are deprived of trade union rights" Khan said at the 9th Congress of the Communist Party of Bangladesh at Mahanagar Natya Mancha. He came down hard on the caretaker government. "The present caretaker government was not doing anything good. Price hikes have exceeded all records of the past. Only an anti-people, detached and cruel government can enhance prices of oil and diesel so much in one go." Khan asked the party leaders and supporters to be ready for a 'revolution'. "US imperialism has collapsed following the rise of communism in Latin America. Such a revolution has to be created in the SAARC zone," he said. The CPB leader also criticised the foreign diplomats in the country. "Foreign diplomats are recognising razakars and fundamentalists as democratic. They want to make it a moderate Muslim state. Who are they to say all these things about Bangladesh? We have emerged as a secular country. What we will be is our business," Khan said. CPB general secretary Mujahidul Islam Selim termed the government's anticorruption drive a part of its implementation of a political blueprint. He said the government formed the Truth and Accountability Commission to free corrupts and looters. Selim said a revolutionary change was needed to overcome the problems of the country. "The country has to be guided imbued with the spirit of the Liberation War. The 1972 constitution and four state principles have to be restored," he said Shaymol Chakravarty, central committee member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), said, "The United States wants to make India a strategic partner for the spread of imperialism." A message from the Chinese Communist Party was read out at the congress by Jung Jing Hong, political attach of the Chinese embassy. He said,"It is hoped that relations between China and Bangladesh will further improve." North Korean ambassador Moon Sung Math, Manju Majumder, Central Communist Party of India (CPI) member and general secretary of West Bengal committee, Sri Lankan Communist Party representative Lakhan De Silva, All-India Forward Bloc central committee member Barun Mukhopadhaya, Pakistan communist party central leader Syed Mazhar Haider, Nepalese communist party executive committee member Suresh Karki and Vietnam communist party representative Fen Yean San also spoke on the occasion. The Congress will continue until Aug 9. bdnews2
