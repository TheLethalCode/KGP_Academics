<TITLE> Boxing hopes for fresh start in Beijing </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIJING, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Boxing in Beijing will try to stay free of the controversy that has accompanied it at Olympics for decades and might end with fewer Cubans winning gold after a string of defections. The sport has been marred by judging scandals and accusations of corruption but has worked hard to clean up its image. The International Olympic Committee was so frustrated by boxing's reputation that it temporarily froze its payments to the International Amateur Boxing Association after the 2004 Olympics. Change came in 2006 when AIBA president Anwar Chowdhry was ousted by Taiwan's Ching-Kuo Wu, who launched a bold set of reforms, notably changing the much-criticised computer scoring system and the rules for assigning referees and judges. Some, however, still have their doubts. "The only thing I'm worried about is the judges," said American world flyweight champion Rau'shee Warren. "I had a couple of bad experiences at the Pan-American Games and in Russia. This is the biggest thing in your life, you've got to take out the judges." Cuba, whose boxers are banned from turning professional and told to concentrate on serving the country, have been on top at recent Games and won five gold medals four years ago in Athens. It might be a different story this time with more and more of their fighters fleeing to join foreign-based promoters and none of their five champions returning to defend their titles. However, that does not mean they should be ruled out, Cuba having plenty of in-depth strength. "We have enough boxers for one, two or three teams," Cuban head coach Pedro Roque told reporters. "The defections don't affect us at all." Cuba, who skipped last year's world championships in Chicago in fear of more defections, can nevertheless expect stiff competition from one of the strongest field seen at Olympics. Russia, the only country with a boxer in all 11 weight classes, are full of confidence with classy middleweight Matvey Korobov their biggest threat. The United States, too, dream of upsetting Cuba to end a lean spell and will rely on a squad featuring two world champions in Warren and welterweight Demetrius Andrade. Britain, where the sport has been through a revolution courtesy of Amir Khan's run to the silver medal in Athens, have several contenders, among them 18-year-old welterweight Billy Joe Saunders and super-heavyweight David Price. Their hopes, however, were dealt a major blow when lightweight Frankie Gavin, who last year became Britain's first world amateur champion, pulled out for failing to make his weight. The action at the Workers' Gymnasium starts on Saturday. The draw, featuring 285 boxers from 78 countries, is on Friday
