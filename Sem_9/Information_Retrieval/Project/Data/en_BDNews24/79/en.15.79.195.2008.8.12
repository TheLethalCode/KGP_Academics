<TEXT>
 Rajshahi, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com)  Rajshahi City Corporation mayor-elect Khairuzzaman Liton has said that the Awami League should go to the upazila elections amid a relaxed state of emergency. "AL should participate in the local government polls on the basis of discussion with the government on relaxing the state of emergency," the newly elected AL-backed Liton told reporters in Dhaka on Tuesday. Asked about the government's announcement that the mayors- and councillors-elect would have to relinquish their party posts before taking oaths, he said: "If the government takes such decision we have to take recourse to law." Liton spoke to reporters after paying floral tribute at the portrait of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in Dhanmondi. bdnews
