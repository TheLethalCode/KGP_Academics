<TITLE> Consensus should be sought on emergency, polls: Evans </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 12 (bdnews24.com) British envoy Stephen Evans said Tuesday a consensus should be sought between the government and political parties on the tenure of emergency and holding elections, as a number of parties including Awami League appear to see no acceptable polls amid emergency. Speaking to reporters after a meeting with the AL acting president Zillur Rahman, Evans added, however, that the present caretaker government is indicating that it would like to hold the elections in a more congenial environment, and see the emergency gradually lifting if circumstances should allow it. The UK High Commissioner one and a half hour meeting with Zillur was also attended by AL presidium member Tofail Ahmed and acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam. Evans said it was "a courtesy call" as the newly arrived British envoy to Bangladesh. He said the UK is committed to working with Bangladesh on development, economic sustainability and climate change, and hoped to work closely with the next elected government beginning 2009, following the December 2008 general election. Asked about Euro MP Nirj Deva's recent statement that the EU would not send election observers to Bangladesh if polls were held under emergency, Evans said it was oversimplifying the issue. The EU will of course send observers if it considers the polls are being held well and proper, he said. Zillur told reporters after the meeting: "We have told the British High Commissioner that we seriously object to holding the polls under emergency." The British envoy said the AL wanted the emergency lifted, the chief adviser too spoke about lifting it in phases. The final decision should be based on the political dialogue between the political parties and the government, he said. bdnews
