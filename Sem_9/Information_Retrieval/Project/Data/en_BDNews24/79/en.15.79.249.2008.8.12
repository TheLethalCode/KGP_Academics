 Dhaka, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com) Six matches of the Citycell Federation Cup finals will be held in Gazipur, which also hosted the qualifying round, with Arambagh Krira Shangha taking on Sunrise Sporting Club in the first match Aug 18. The decision was taken Tuesday at a meeting between the participating team representatives and the BFF officials at the BFF House. "The teams have agreed to play outside the capital and six matches of the final round have been shifted to Gazipur," said Fazlur Rahman Babul, chairman of the BFF bylaws and fixture committee, after the meeting. Besides Abahani Limited, Dhaka Mohammedan SC, Brothers Union, Sheikh Russel KC Muktijoddha Sangsad and Chittagong Mohammedan SC, the remaining 10 teams will play in Gazipur. The BFF Monday postponed the ongoing Fed Cup for a week following inclement weather and national and religious occasions. Babul said that all group-phase matches would end Aug 24 and they would announce the schedule for quarterfinals later. The matches to be held in Gazipur are Arambagh KS vs Sunrise SC (Aug 18), Farashganj SC vs Dhaka Wanderers Club (Aug 19), Chittagong Abahani Limited vs Jatrabari Krira Chakra (Aug 21), Rahmatganj MFS vs Sunrise SC (Aug 22), Khulna Abahani KC vs Wanderers Club (Aug 23) and Victoria Sporting Club vs Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan (Aug 24).
