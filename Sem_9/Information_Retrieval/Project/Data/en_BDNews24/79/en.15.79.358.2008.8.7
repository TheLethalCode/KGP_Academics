 HARARE, Thu Aug 7,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa, which has been mediating to end Zimbabwe's political crisis, said on Thursday power-sharing talks were making good progress. South Africa has been leading regional peace efforts and President Thabo Mbeki was expected later in the Zimbabwean capital Harare, where President Robert Mugabe and opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai were due to meet. The two sides began talking two and a half weeks ago to defuse a crisis which came to a head after the veteran president was reelected in a widely condemned June poll boycotted by the opposition. "Government as the mediator will not be giving any details about details of the talks except to say that they are progressing extremely well," a South African spokesman said. Johannesburg's daily Star said South African mediators had met Zimbabwean security chiefs, seen as key to any resolution to the crisis which has ruined the once prosperous economy and flooded neighboring states with millions of refugees. Citing unnamed sources, the newspaper said the officials, at the talks this week in Pretoria, "wanted to ensure that their interests are catered for in any agreement reached". The powerful security officials are unlikely to accept any power-sharing deal unless they are given protection from international justice, analysts say. Mugabe's ruling ZANU-PF and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) called on their supporters on Wednesday to end political violence, the clearest sign of progress in the talks to date. They are under heavy international pressure, including from within Africa, to resolve the crisis. Under a draft settlement reported in The Star on Wednesday, Tsvangirai would run the country while Mugabe would become ceremonial president. Tsvangirai would head Zimbabwe as executive prime minister during a transitional period, appointing two deputies -- one from ZANU-PF and the other from the MDC. But The Star said the MDC wants a 24-30 month transitional period, while ZANU-PF wanted a five-year period. The opposition says that only Tsvangirai can lead a new government because he won a first-round presidential vote in March before pulling out of the June 27 run-off because of violence he says killed 122 of his supporters. ZANU-PF has said it will not accept any deal that fails to recognize Mugabe's re-election
