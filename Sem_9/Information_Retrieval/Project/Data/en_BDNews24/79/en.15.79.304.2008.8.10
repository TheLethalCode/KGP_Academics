 BEIJING, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China and Romania have voiced their concerns about the early starts to the Olympic team and all-round finals. Many top athletes have accused the International Olympic Committee of putting their interests behind those of American host broadcaster NBC, which paid $3.55 billion for the 2000-2008 Games and wanted morning finals to show on prime-time TV in the U.S. "I'm tense about it, because I'll be lying awake worrying about it all night, I'll be very tired by the morning," China's triple world vault champion Cheng Fei told reporters on Sunday. When the plans were first made public in 2006, Chinese men's all-round favourite Yang Wei was extremely critical of the schedule. Traditionally, all 14 artistic gymnastics medals are contested during evening sessions. In Beijing the apparatus finals will still be held in the evening. "It is a very bad decision for athletes as we seldom had any intense training in the mornings before," Yang said. Romania coach Nicolae Forminte agreed. "There was a definite influence on the girls to feel emotional and tired and this may be taken as a disadvantage to them to compete at this hour," he said. The men's team final is on Tuesday and the women's on Wednesday
