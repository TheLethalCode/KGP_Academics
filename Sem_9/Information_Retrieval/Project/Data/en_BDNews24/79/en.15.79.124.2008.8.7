 Dhaka, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission has decided to launch a reinvestigation into alleged corruption in the Barapukuria coalmine project, an official said Thursday. ACC deputy director Md Abul Kashem Fakir has been put on the case as the new investigation officer. ACC assistant director Md Shamsul Alam filed a case with Shahbagh Police Station on Feb 26 against 16 people including former prime minister Khaleda Zia and 10 former ministers for misusing power. ACC had earlier completed an investigation into the matter. Deputy director Md Monirul Haque was the investigation officer. The anti-graft watchdog decided to reinvestigate the coalmine corruption as some issues were not clear in the previous investigation report. Former finance minister M Saifur Rahman, former LGRD and cooperatives minister Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, former health minister Dr Khandker Mosharraf Hossain, former industries minister Motiur Rahman Nizami, former information minister M Shamsul Islam and former agriculture minister MK Anwar were among the accused in the case. According to case details, the accused allegedly resorted to irregularities and corruption to hand over the charge of the coalmine to a Chinese company, costing the state coffers Tk 158.71 crore in losses. bdnews2
