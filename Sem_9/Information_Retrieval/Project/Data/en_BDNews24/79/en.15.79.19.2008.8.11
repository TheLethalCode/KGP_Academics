<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com) -- Prisons authorities along with the election officials will go to special jail Monday to register detained former prime minister Khaleda Zia as a voter, a senior prisons official said. "The election officials will go to the special jail around midday," deputy inspector general of prisons Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told bdnews24.com. No instruction had come until then on the release of the BNP chairperson, said Siddiqui. Two caretaker government advisers had earlier said that the procedure to Khaleda's release was "at final stages". Election commissioner M Sakhawat Hussain told reporters Monday: "We hope that Khaleda Zia will register today, on the last day of voter registration and correction in Dhaka City Corporation." "We have already requested her to enroll through the prisons authorities. Now this is a matter for her to decide whether she will sign up," Sakhawat said. Asked whether Khaleda would be able to register in future if she did not intend to become voter Monday the commissioner said: "Well, only time will tell." Dhaka divisional deputy election commissioner Biswas Lutfor Rahman told bdnews24.com Monday that his office had given voter forms to the prisons authorities for 30 VIP prisoners. Earlier on Sunday, Khaleda had asked the Election Commission to let her know about the barriers to contest the national polls for those who did not become voters on time, Siddiqui said. According to the Representation of the People (amendment) Ordinance 2008, one cannot contest the polls unless he or she is registered as a voter. The EC had requested the BNP chairperson seven times to enroll since voter registration began, but she did not take any steps to do so, the prison official said.
