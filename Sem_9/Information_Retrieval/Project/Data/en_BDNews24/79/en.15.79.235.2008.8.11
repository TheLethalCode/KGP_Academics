 Dhaka, August 11 (bdnews24.com)The High Court granted former BNP minister Khandakar Mosharraf Hossain three months' interim bail on Monday in the Gatco graft case. A HC bench of Justice Sharif Uddin Chakladar and Justice Md Imdadul Haque Azad simultaneously halted the case proceedings against him for the period. The court also ordered the Anticorruption Commission and the government to explain why the case filed against him should not be cancelled. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case with Tejgaon Police Station against Khaleda, Coco and 11 others on Sept 2 last year, on charges of awarding Global Agro Trade Company a cargo-handling deal through misuse of power. Joint forces arrested Khaleda and Coco as accused in the GATCO case on Sept 3. The commission later pressed charges against a total of 25 people, on May 13 this year. The HC in July granted two months' bail to Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan and Shamsul Islam, accused in the case, and stayed the case proceedings against the two for the bail period. bdnews24.com/at/th/wz/rah/1648 hours bdnews24.
