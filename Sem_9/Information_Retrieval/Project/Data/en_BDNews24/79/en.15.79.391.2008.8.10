 BEIJING, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nino Salukvadze of Georgia embraced her Russian rival and made a moving appeal for peace after winning an Olympic bronze medal in shooting on Sunday. Salukvadze, who competed only after the 35-member Georgian team were told by their president to remain at the Games in the "best interest of the country" despite Russian military attacks on its territory, finished behind Russia's Natalia Paderina. "If the world were to draw any lessons from what I did there would never be any wars," Salukvadze said. The two rival shooterswho were once team mates in the Soviet Unionhugged and kissed each other on the cheeks after the dramatic final in the Beijing shooting range hall, where China's Guo Wenjung came from behind to win the gold medal. "We live in the 21st Century, after all," said Salukvadze, who wiped tears from her eyes when she put her pistol down after her final shot and the crowd applauded. "We shouldn't really stoop so low to wage wars against each other." Russian bombers have widened an offensive to force back Georgian troops seeking control over the breakaway region of South Ossetia. Salukvadze was asked about her moving post-match handshake and embrace with Paderinawho had led Guo going into the finals but appeared to be rattled when the crowd of 2,000 did not applaud her introduction before the finals. "As far as the hugging and kissing goes, I do that with many friends. I have many friends around the world and will always do that. There should be no hatred among athletes and people," she said. "Politicians should straighten out the situation today and if they don't, we'll have to get involved," added Salukvadze, who won a silver medal in this event in the 1988 Olympics. She also won gold in 1988 in the 25m pistol event. She said her medal was a victory for all of Georgia. "It's a small victory for my people," she said, before looking across to Paderina and adding: "When it comes to sports we will always remain friends and nothing will effect our friendshipeven in such a scary event as shooting." Silver medal winner Paderina confirmed her friendship with Salukvadze, sitting to her right: "We are friends indeed. We've been shooting together for a long time. She used to shoot for (the Soviet Union). We are really friends and don't get mixed up in political things. Sports is not politics." Salukvadze and her Georgia team mates had offered to withdraw over the conflict with Russia in South Ossetia. But President Mikheil Saakashvili sent a message overnight instructing them to stay. Saakashvili's message to continue was relayed to the team at a 2 a.m. (1800 GMT) meeting on Sunday by the country's first lady, who is in Beijing
