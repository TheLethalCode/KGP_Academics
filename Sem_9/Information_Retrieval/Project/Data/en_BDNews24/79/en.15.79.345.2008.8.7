 COLOMBO, Thu Aug 7, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Maldives President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom ratified the country's new constitution on Thursday, aiming to pursue a "modern, multi-party, democratic system" and giving more powers to the judiciary and legislature. The new constitution, developed over the past four years, includes a judiciary run by an independent commission, and independent commissions to oversee elections and fight corruption. New to the Maldives government, these measures and others in the document aim to bring full democracy to the Sunni Muslim nation of 300,000 people scattered across 1,200 mostly uninhabited islands 500km from India. The new constitution reduced the executive powers vested under the president and strengthened the parliament, which would be elected through an electoral system giving each 5,000 people one member of parliament, replacing a system that was less representative and also included some seats appointed by the president. "We are not doing this as an illusion for the eye, but for the benefit of the country," President Gayoom said soon after announcing official ratification of the new constitution. "The real work is bringing the constitution into effect. Democracy can bind everyone together even if we are different from one another." Asia's longest-serving leader Gayoom, who has held the reins of the archipelago since 1978, first pledged the reforms to the earlier constitution following a crackdown on mass protests in 2003, and criticism over his government's human rights record. The country's constitution was last revised in 1998, putting the president at the head of all government bodies. "What many societies have achieved in hundreds of years has been encapsulated here in four years," said the head of the constitutional drafting committee, Ibrahim Ismail. On Wednesday, four cabinet ministers resigned from the government as the new constitution had banned ministers from engaging in business. Presidential elections are due to be held by Oct. 10
