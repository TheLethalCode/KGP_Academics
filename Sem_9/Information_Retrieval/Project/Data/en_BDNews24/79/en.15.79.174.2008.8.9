<TITLE> Taslima hopefully poses no problem: Pranab </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 New Delhi, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com)  Indian foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee on Saturday said he hoped their 'guest' Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin would cause no problem. "It is not possible for the foreign minister of a country to keep track of the country's guests. It is for them to decide. "We expect our guest not to do anything which is causing a problem to any of our citizen and there will no problem due to his or her stay in this country," he said. Taslima , who left India after protests broke out against her in West Bengal last year, landed in Delhi on Friday morning after spending more than four months in Sweden. The 45-year-old Bangladeshi writer arrived at the Indira Gandhi International airport and was immediately taken away by security agencies to an undisclosed destination. Taslim has a visa for India valid until Aug 12. Taslima, threatened by radical Islamists, became a victim of political ping-pong in India last November, bundled from one city to another in a controversy critics said had shamed the secular state. Authorities rushed the controversial writer, who criticises the use of religion as an oppressive force, from her home in Kolkata after protests against her by Muslim groups led to riots, forcing the army to be called onto the streets. The riots appeared to be the culmination of years of simmering anger at Taslima, by a section of radical Muslims, for saying Islam and other religions oppress women. Indian clerics had issued a "death warrant" against her in August. After the riots, police moved her to the western state of Rajasthan and then Delhi under police protection. She eventually had to leave India for her own security. bdnews
