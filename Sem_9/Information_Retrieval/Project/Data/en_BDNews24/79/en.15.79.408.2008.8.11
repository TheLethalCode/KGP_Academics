 Dhaka, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com)Mayors and councillors-elect who contested the Aug 4 polls from behind bars will be released on parole to take oaths of office, an adviser said Monday. "The government will make arrangements to release them on parole immediately after the Election Commission published the results of the four city corporations and nine municipalities by gazette," local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal told reporters at his secretariat office. Along with four city corporation and nine municipality mayors, 265 councillors were elected to different reserved and general wards on Aug 4. Sylhet mayor-elect Badruddin Ahmed Kamarn and Manikganj mayor-elect Ramzan Ali among others are currently behind bars.
