 Rajshahi, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com)  Rajshahi City Corporation mayor-elect Khairuzzaman Liton has retracted his statement two hours after he said the Awami League should go to the upazila elections amid a relaxed state of emergency. "AL should participate in the local government polls on the basis of discussion with the government on relaxing the state of emergency," the newly elected AL-backed Liton told reporters in Dhaka on Tuesday. Asked about the government's announcement that the mayors- and councillors-elect would have to relinquish their party posts before taking oaths, the Rajshahi AL leader said: "If the government takes such decision we have to take recourse to law." Liton spoke to reporters after paying floral tribute at the portrait of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in Dhanmondi. After the statement, Liton went to meet acting party president Zillur Rahman at his Gulshan home where reporters asked Zillur to give his reaction to Liton's statement. But Liton rushed to his own defence: "I did not say so. I spoke for withdrawal of the state of emergency. AL presidium member Tofail Ahmed present there said, "Election under emergency will not in any way be acceptable." Earlier, as Zillur was having a meeting with British High Commissioner Stephen Evans and Liton and his supporters was waiting there, journalists had to him for confirmation of his statement. Liton again said, "Through easing the state of emergency and on the basis of discussion with the government Awami League should participate in the local government elections." The AL leader later said he would move the court against the provision the government made for mayors-elect quitting party post before taking oath. Earlier Zillur criticised the government for not giving bail to former AL government minister engineer Mosharraf Hossain despite a High Court order. "If the High Court order is ignored in this way then where the honour of the country stands?" bdnews24.com
