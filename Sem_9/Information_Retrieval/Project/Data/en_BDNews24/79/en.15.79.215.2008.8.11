<TEXT>
 Dhaka, , Aug 11 (bdnews24.com) French ambassador to Bangladesh Charley Causeret has contradicted a recent statement by Euro MP Nirj Deva on whether the EU would send election observers to Bangladesh if polls were held under emergency. Nirj Deva, during his visit to Bangladesh last week, said that the European Union did not send observers to elections held under a state of emergency. Causeret said France and the other European countries did not see any problem in Bangladesh holding the next parliamentary polls under the state of emergency if the candidates campaigned and the voters cast votes freely. "No-one can say whether the EU will send a poll observation mission to Bangladesh, because the decision is to be taken by the EC's external relations wing on the basis of the report submitted by the exploratory mission which visited Bangladesh in June," Causeret told bdnews24.com in an interview at his residence Monday. France is the current chair of the 27-nation European Union. He said there were three components of the EUmember states, the European Parliament and the European Commission (EC), the EU secretariat. "By the end of September or early October, the EC could decide on sending an observation mission to Bangladesh," the French ambassador said. "By December, things may change," he added. He hoped that the elections would be held by the end of December. According to practice, the EC dispatches an exploratory mission to a country before deciding to send election observers. The EC Commissioner for external relations makes the final decision on its report. The exploratory mission visited Bangladesh between June 15 and 22. The mission is set to submit its report by the end of August. The French ambassador said 93 percent of voters cast their votes in the Aug 4 city and municipal polls. There was no violence during the polls, everything went smoothly, he said. "Where was the state of emergency? I did not find any state of emergency while visiting the Pourashabha polls in Fulbaria, Mymensignh," the French envoy said. "France and other European countries share the same view that the next parliamentary polls could be held under the state of emergency if the voters cast votes and the candidates carried out campaigns, rallies and other publicity activities," the ambassador said. The state of emergency was declared to maintain order, Causeret added. He also praised the armed forces for registering 80 million voters. "It is interesting that the political parties are only demanding a lifting of the state of emergency," the ambassador said. "They are not talking about their plans for poverty alleviation and other development issues." bdnew
