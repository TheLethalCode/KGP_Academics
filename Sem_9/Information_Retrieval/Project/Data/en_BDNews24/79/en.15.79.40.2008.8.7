<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court began the trial of Arafat Rahman Coco on Thursday, on charges of amassing illegal wealth and concealing wealth-related information. Judge Md Sirajul Islam's Special Court-7 framed charges against the younger son of former prime minister Khaleda Zia on Thursday and set Aug 13 for testimony-taking. Coco's lawyer Md Taherul Islam Touhid termed the charge framing illegal, telling bdnews24.com that his client was indicted in the absence of his appointed lawyer. He asked to the court to defer the charge framing hearing for three weeks, but the judge denied the motion. The lawyer in question, Sanaullah Miah, was absent during Thursday's charge framing due to illness. Public prosecutor Mosharraf Hossain Kajal presented the charges against Coco, in a case filed by the Anticorruption Commission on April 23. Coco is charged with amassing two crore taka beyond his known income and suppressing information from the ACC in a wealth statement in which he owned to assets of Tk 8 crore. The ACC sent a notice to the former prime minister's son seeking a statement of all his moveable and immoveable assets on Dec 18 last year. Coco is currently in Bangkok for seeking medical treatment on two months' bail. He was exempted from personal appearance in the case. bdnew
