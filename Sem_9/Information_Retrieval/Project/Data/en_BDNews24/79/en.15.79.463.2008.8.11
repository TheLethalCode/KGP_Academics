 HARARE, Mon Aug 11, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe's ruling party and Morgan Tsvangirai's opposition on Monday resumed power-sharing talks which President Robert Mugabe said were about "little hurdles". Mugabe and Tsvangirai arrived at a Harare hotel shortly before 1400 GMT for talks that could end a post-election political crisis and raise hopes of economic recovery. Negotiations were broken off in the early hours of Monday. Asked by reporters if the negotiation process may be concluded on Monday, MDC leader Tsvangirai said: "Hope so". But an opposition source said a power-sharing agreement was being held up by Mugabe's refusal to give up executive powers. Negotiations began last month after Mugabe's unopposed re-election in June in a poll condemned throughout the world and boycotted by Tsvangirai because of attacks on his supporters. The rival leaders ended a 14 hour meeting early on Monday. Mugabe told supporters at a rally in Harare that there was progress in talks with Tsvangirai and breakaway MDC faction leader Arthur Mutambara. South African President Thabo Mbeki is mediating. "We had a long night negotiating on some little hurdles and I thought I should raise my fist but he (Mbeki) remained cool and said: 'Let us continue talking'," Mugabe said in a speech to honor those who died fighting in Zimbabwe's liberation war. He has been in power since independence from Britain in 1980. The opposition source close to the talks said Mugabe's ruling ZANU-PF party was demanding that Mutambara be given a position as a deputy prime minister. "The major hold-up is the refusal by Mugabe to cede his executive powers. He is only agreeing to a nominal prime minister post for Morgan Tsvangirai," the source said. "They (ZANU-PF) are also insisting that Mutambara becomes one of the deputy prime ministers. Obviously that is not acceptable to us". PRESSURE Tsvangirai declined to comment after the last session of talks. Mbeki's spokesman, Mukoni Ratshitanga, said the South African leader was returning home on Monday. But he declined to say whether a deal was imminent or whether the talks could fail. Both sides are under international pressure for a deal, particularly from neighboring countries that fear the consequences of a total meltdown in Zimbabwe. Economic collapse has already driven millions of Zimbabweans to seek work abroad. Analysts say there are a host of issues that need to be tackled before a solid deal is possible. First and foremost is whether Mugabe will be ready to give up some of the powers that have helped him keep a tight grip on Tsvangirai and other foes. Control of immensely powerful security forces in the southern African country is another key question. If Tsvangirai were to get only insignificant ministries, it might anger other MDC officials and supporters who braved what they say was a ruthless government crackdown during the election. The MDC says 120 of its supporters were killed. Despite the difficulties, the discussions are seen as the clearest sign yet that an agreement could be within reach. Investors are likely to remain cautious, however, seeking reassurances that any new government can rescue what was once one of Africa's most promising economies and create conditions that will make them feel safe. A deal would hand Mbeki a political coup before he hosts an August 16-17 summit in South Africa of regional leaders who mandated him to mediate in Zimbabwe. Mbeki has dismissed criticism that he has been too soft on Mugabe, arguing a tougher line would only aggravate tensions and undermine efforts to ease suffering in a country with the world's highest inflation rate of over two million percent, chronic shortages of basic goods and 80 percent unemployment
