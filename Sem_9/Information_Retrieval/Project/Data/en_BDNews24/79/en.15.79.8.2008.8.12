 Dhaka, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com)  The government appointed search committee has finalised three panels of probable candidates for the appointment of vice chancellors to three public universities, a committee member said Tuesday. The search committee, in a meeting held in the education ministry, formed the panels to appoint VCs for Jessore University of Science and Technology, Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology and Dinajpur Haji Danesh University of Science and Technology. "We have prepared lists of eligible VC candidates for the universities; each list has names of not more than three. One will be appointed as VC from the panel," said Prof Wahiduddin Mahmud, co-chairman of the committee. Member secretary of the search committee AZM Shafikul Alam, also joint secretary of the education ministry, said: "We have made the selection considering academic qualification, experiences and administrative skills of the candidates." He said the recommendations will be sent to the chancellor this week for appointment to be finalised next week. A member of the search committee, preferring not to be named, said that some 36 candidates applied for the VC post of the Jessore University of Science and Technology, 24 for Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology and 45 applications were submitted for Dinajpur Haji Danesh University of Science and Technology. Applications were also invited for vacant VC posts for Mymensingh Agricultural University, Jagannath University, Noakhali University of Science and Technology, Comilla University of Science and Technology and Patuakhali University of Science and Technology, an official of the education ministry said. The meeting was presided over by education secretary Momtazul Islam, chairman of the search committee. The education ministry formed the search committee on July 29 last year for suggesting names from among the interested candidates for the appointment of VCs, pro-VCs and treasurers in all public universities except for Dhaka University, Chittagong University, Jahangir Nagar University and Rajshahi University. bdnews
