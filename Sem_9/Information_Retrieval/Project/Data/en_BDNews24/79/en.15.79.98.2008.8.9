 Dhaka, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com)  The government would implement the regulations on the employment of indigenous people, cultural affairs adviser Rasheda K Chowdhury said on Saturday. "The regulations on the employment of indigenous people are at final stages," the adviser said while addressing a programme marking the International Day of the World's Indigenous People at the Central Shahid Minar. "No government has implemented the regulations so far. The incumbent government will accomplish the task," she said. Rasheda said that the government would establish a number of cultural institutes for the indigenous people so that they can uphold their culture and protect tradition. "The indigenous community has been enriching our culture through their heritage over the years," she said. The government has moved to arrange education for the workers of the tea gardens, the adviser said. "We have talked to the owners," she said. "Boarding schools will be established in the hill tracts where the indigenous community will have the scope to study in their vernaculars," Rasheda said. CHT Regional Council chairman Jyotirindra Bodhiprira Larma, better known as Santu Larma, said the indigenous people would have to struggle to realise their social, political and economic rights. The inaugural session demanded that the day be observed by the state. The International Day of the World's Indigenous People is being observed countrywide with the theme, 'Indigenous people's economic and social rights'. The United Nations (UN) General Assembly decided to celebrate the day on August 9 every year adopting a resolution on Dec 23, 1994. A rally was brought out from the Central Shahid Minar around the midday that ended at National Museum. bdnews2
