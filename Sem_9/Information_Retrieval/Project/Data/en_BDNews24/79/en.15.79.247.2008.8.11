 Dhaka, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com)  The armed forces will not be deployed at polling centres during the upazila polls, an election commissioner clarified Monday. M Sakhawat Hussain made the remarks following the Election Commission's recent statement on army deployment for the upcoming polls. "The law enforcers including the army will not be vested with any judicial powers, but they will be able to arrest people without warrants," Sakhawat told reporters at the EC Secretariat. "The results of the polls to four city corporations and nine municipalities will be published this week," he said. The local government ministry will set a day for oath taking, Sakhawat said, adding that the mayors- and councillors-elect will have to relinquish their party posts before taking oaths. "As the candidates signed the nomination papers accepting those conditions they should give up their party posts." "If they change their decision now the voters will judge them," he said. Awami League and other political parties however have opposed the move. AL-backed candidates were elected mayors of four city corporations and eight out of nine municipalities in the Aug 4 polls. Acting AL general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam told reporters Sunday that AL leaders elected in the city corporations would take the government to court if it decided unilaterally on the issue. In his reaction, Sakhawat said: "If anybody goes to court the government will handle it." A number of elected city corporation mayors and municipal councilors, including Sylhet City Corporation mayor-elect Badaruddin Kamran and Manikganj municipal mayor-elect Ramzan Ali are currently behind bars. Their families are taking steps to release them before swearing in. Asma Kamran, wife of Badaruddin Kamran, told bdnews24.com Sunday that they would take next steps in consultation with a lawyer. Letters were sent to the establishment ministry and law, justice and parliamentary affairs ministry to formulate an electoral tribunal and an appeal tribunal before the publication of a gazette to settle electoral disputes. "The law ministry will form a tribunal along with the joint district judge and district judge at the suggestion of the Supreme Court," an official of Election Commission told bdnews24.com Sunday. "One will be able to appeal in the tribunal against electoral dispute within 30 days of the publication of the gazette," the official said. bdnews
