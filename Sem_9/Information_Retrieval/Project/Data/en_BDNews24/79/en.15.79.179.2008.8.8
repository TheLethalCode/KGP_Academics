 Dhaka, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com)  Muktijoddha Sangsad Krira Chakra survived a setback when they came from behind to play a 1-1 draw against Dhaka Wanderers Club in the Group A opener of the Citycell Federation Cup at Bangabandhu National Stadium Friday (updates). Muktijoddha Sangsad went one goal down in the 44th minute with their defender M Razib sending the ball into his own net while attempting to clear a right-side lob from opponent Ebaed Hossain Komol while Muktis captain Firoz Mahmud Titu restored the margin in the 78th minute. Last edition runners-up Muktijoddha, who lost their strength over the formation of the central command council, which runs football, and competed the players' registration on the day the transfer window was closed, hardly impressed an approximately 1,000 strong holiday crowd in the big bowl. With a bunch of young players, the senior division side Dhaka Wanderers Club, who came to the finals playing the 11-team qualifiers, gave a tough time to Mutkijoddha Sangsad with making the first attack in the very second minute. With needing just to beat goalkeeper Nizam Majumder, Wanderers' striker Munir Hossain drove the ball straight to the Muktijoddha goalkeeper to miss a real scoring chance. Muktijoddha's long-serving striker Rukonuzzaman Kanchan floated the ball over the Wanderers post in the 25th minute while two minutes later his striking partner Murad Hossain Milon squandered the day's easiest chance to send the ball wide despite beating Wanderers' goalkeeper Sazzad Hossain Raju. Before conceding an own goal, Milon and Kanchan again missed the target, and towering defender Razib volleyed a Komol cross into their own net while he attempted to clear it. After the breather, Muktijoddha Sangsad's defender Aziz-Al-Arman all but went to score another suicidal goal, but his shot narrowly went to the sidebar and Muktijoddha survived another scare in the 76th minute. Three minutes later, substitute Walid Khan fed the ball to Titu, whose left-footed drive found the back of the Wanderers net that levelled the Muktijoddha Sangsad margin. Muktijoddha Sangsad could have left the field with a triumph had Wanderers goalkeeper Raju not denied a close-range diving header from substitute Azmol Hossain Bidduth four minutes from time. In the second match, Farashganj Sporting Club made a flying start with an emphatic 3-0 win over Khulna Abahani Krira Chakra. Farashganj took a lead with M Mamun putting them ahead in the 24th minute. Enamul doubled the lead in the 43rd minute before Mamun struck his second goal in the 69th minute to seal the match.
