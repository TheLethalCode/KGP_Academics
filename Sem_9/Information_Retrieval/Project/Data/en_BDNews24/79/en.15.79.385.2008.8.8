 BEIJING, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China celebrates its ancient past and modern power at the Olympics opening on Friday, seeking to shift the global focus from rights criticisms to sport. The ceremony caps seven years of work that reshaped Beijing and sets the seal on an economic boom that has seen China and its 1.3 billion people become an emerging superpower. "The historic moment we have long awaited is arriving," President Hu Jintao told world leaders including U.S. President George W. Bush at a welcome lunch. "The world has never needed mutual understanding, mutual toleration and mutual cooperation as much as it does today." More than 80 leaders and royals will attend the ceremony in the head-turning, metal-latticed Bird's Nest Olympic stadium. Advertising its new economic clout, China has invested $43 billion on the Games. Some $100 million, twice the 2004 Athens bill, has gone on "big bang" opening and closing ceremonies. The Games start at 8 p.m. on the eighth day of the eighth monththe number appropriately symbolizing fortunebefore an estimated global audience of at least one billion. Some 14,000 performers and 29,000 fireworks will give the Games a glittering start. Film director Zhang Yimou, whose work was once banned in China, was given the task of condensing 5,000 years of Chinese history into one show. The careful choreography extends well beyond the stadium. A security force of 100,000 police fanned out to prevent attacks and protests, while dissidents have been swept away. Many are being held under house arrest, while others have fled to distant provinces or been taken on enforced "holidays" by state security minders, human rights groups and activists said. "I can go outside, but I have to ride in the police car with my guards wherever I go," said Yu Jie, a dissident-writer. "It's absurd, because I have no interest in the Olympics, not even in watching them on television." SMOG PERSISTS The elements, though, have proved hard to master. Authorities have closed factories and pulled millions of cars off the road, yet smog and haze enveloped the capital on Fridayobscuring views of the futuristic skyline. With hours to go, foreign activists issued an on-air challenge to the host city with a pirate radio broadcast, calling for freeing of political prisoners and lifting of censorship. Their words were often drowned out by a local official broadcast. In Nepal, police detained at least 740 Tibetan refugees who tried to storm Beijing's consular office to protest against Chinese rule in their Himalayan homeland. Just hours before the ceremony, an Air China flight from Japan turned back after the airline received a bomb threat in an email which also said the Games site would be attacked, Japanese police said. It landed safely on return. That came after a little-known Islamist group issued an Internet threat to the Games on Thursday. A video dated August 1 showed images of the Olympics logo in flames and a masked speaker with an AK-47, according to the U.S.-based SITE Intelligence Group that monitors statements from militants. China has, however, repeatedly said its greatest worry is internal. Earlier this week, suspected Islamist separatists killed 16 policemen in its far west. YAO MING LEADS The best-known face of Chinese sport, 7ft 6in NBA basketball player Yao Ming, will lead his team at the opening ceremony. But in a move that could embarrass both China and Sudan, U.S. athletes chose former Sudanese refugee Lopez Lomong, a victim of government-sponsored Arab militias in the south who fled at the age of 6 in 1991, to carry their flag around the track. China is a major oil investor and arms seller in Sudan, and global campaigners blame it for failing to pressure Khartoum to end the conflict in its western region of Darfur. Unfortunately for the Olympic ideal of global harmony, the two Koreas failed to agree to march at the opening as a unified team even though they managed that in 2004 and 2000. Though Bush said he was coming for sport not politics, he reiterated on Friday "our belief that all people should have the freedom to say what they think and worship as they choose." The finer points of global geopolitics are unlikely, however, to dampen the enthusiasm of many Chinese. "My heart is bursting with excitement about the Games," said Zhu Shegqiang, a 22-year-old student walking through Tiananmen Square. "I want people to see what is special about China." Sporting action hits top gear the day after the ceremony with seven gold medals up for grabs on Saturday. After weeks of less than glowing headlines, China can look forward to a probable publicity boost. The first gold will almost certainly be awarded in the 10m air rifle contest, and Chinese shooter Du Li is a strong favorite to win. After coming third in the medal table in 2000 and second in 2004, China is hoping to topple the Americans this time around
