 LONDON, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New captain Kevin Pietersen, buoyed by a six-wicket victory over South Africa on Monday, said England were capable of regaining the Ashes next year. An excited Pietersen gushed superlatives when he described England's win and said his team could beat Australia if they replicated their performance in the fourth and final test at The Oval. "I could not have asked any more from the boys," said Pietersen even though England lost the series 2-1 to South Africa. "If we play like we played this week we can beat Australia. The key is to turn up like we did this week in every game." South Africa will have the first crack at the world's top-ranked nation at the end of 2008. "That's going to be a very interesting series ... one I'm really going to watch closely," Pietersen told reporters after claiming the man of the match award for his century in his first innings as test skipper last Friday. England were whitewashed in Australia last year after winning the Ashes at home in 2005 when Pietersen made his name as a barnstorming batsman. South Africa captain Graeme Smith, who said Pietersen had proved confident and positive as a leader, was circumspect about his team's clash with Australia. "Hopefully we can keep everybody fit for Australia and if we can round off the season with a win that would be great," Smith said. SUCCESSFUL SEASON Smith, whose side beat England at Headingley and Edgbaston to win the series, said the season was the most successful South Africa had enjoyed. "But this one is the one that has meant most to us," he said after the visitors clinched a test-series victory in England for the first time since 1965. "We have waited a long time for this moment, we came here with a goal in mind and that was to win the series and we are really chuffed to have done it." Smith has been captain for five years. Pietersen, who took over from a tearful Michael Vaughan after the Edgbaston defeat, for only a week. "I've been seven days in the job now and I've enjoyed every single minute of it," said England's skipper. Smith said it was too early to assess Pietersen as a captain. "It's going to take some time to see his style and how things develop," said Smith. Both captains praised paceman Steve Harmison, who grabbed four wickets on his England return and bowled with venom. "If he bowls like he bowled in this game he's going to be a real asset," Smith said. Pietersen said: "He was magnificent. I asked him to be like the old Steve Harmison and he was. I'm definitely going to get the best out of Steve." He also added he was trying to persuade Harmison to come out of one-day international retirement.
