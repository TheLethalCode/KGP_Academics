<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com)  The commerce adviser on Thursday took a dig at banks for 'not working for the poor' and said Bangladesh could attain 10 percent GDP growth if political stability were there. Hossain Zillur Rahman said banks and other financial institutions were not working for the poor. "They only invest in urban areas to gain profit. They don't think about poor people at all," he adviser said while inaugurating a three-day fair of banks and financial institutions at Sheraton Hotel. "But the banks and other financial institutions have to understand that the poor are not a burden. They can make crores in profit by offering services to the marginalised people," he said. The adviser cited the example of the ICICI Bank of India and said, "This bank has raked in huge profits by providing services to the country's poor community." He suggested the banks invest in new sectors by appointing skilled people with vision. Salehuddin Ahmed, the central bank chief, said: "Microcredit is not sufficient for the betterment of the poor. Banks and the financial institutes should stand beside them." He asked the banks and other organisations to introduce new schemes for the poor. GDP GROWTH Hossain Zillur said Bangladesh could attain 10 percent GDP growth if there was political stability. "Bangladesh is reaching such a position that it can achieve five percent GDP growth in any circumstances," "The country is capable of gaining five percent GDP growth if an unstable condition remains there," he said. "And another five percent GDP growth is possible if there remains political stability." "The people of Bangladesh are hard working. They do not wait for leaders or policies," he explained. "We are doing fine amid lots of problems, which is becoming possible thanks to our our laborious people," he said. Zillur said the government was working to bring a qualitative change to the political and economic spheres. "Both works are going together. We hope to get positive results from the sectors," he said. "Our main challenge is to identify problems and take effective measures to resolve those." bdnew
