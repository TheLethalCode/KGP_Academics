 MOSCOW, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Georgia needs more evidence of a Russian halt to military operations and will remain "prepared for everything" until Moscow signs a peace deal, Georgian Prime Minister Lado Gurgenidze told Reuters on Tuesday. "We will need more evidence, everyone in this situation needs a signed binding agreement," Gurgenidze told Reuters by telephone from an extraordinary meeting of parliament. "Until that happens we are mobilised, we are prepared for everything," he said. "I do appreciate it (Medvedev's gesture) ... but there has been more damage to infrastructure and civilian casualties today."
