Rahul Dravid was batting on 46 and VVS Laxman was unbeaten on 17 after Virender Sehwag (34) and Gautam Gambhir (26) put on 62 runs for the opening wicket. Sehwag, tearing apart the bowlers during his brief stay, cut a good length ball off pacer Dhammika Prasad from outside the off stump into the waiting hands of Thilan Samaraveera at gully. His knock included seven hits to the boundary. Gambhir was the next to go, clean bowled by Prasad for 26. The ball landed short of length and moved outside off stump and Gambhir went for the pull and got an inside edge to his stumps.

Sri Lanka were finally bowled out for 396 about one hour after lunch with Ajantha Mendia being the last to go LBW to Anil Kumble for 17.
