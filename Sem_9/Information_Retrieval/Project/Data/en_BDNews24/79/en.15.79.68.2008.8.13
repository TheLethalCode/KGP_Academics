 Brahmanbaria, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com)  Ashuganj Power Station Company resumed production at all its units Wednesday, after more than two years, an official said, raising hopes of an improvement in the power situation. Ashuganj is the second largest power station in Bangladesh, capable of producing 724MW power with all eight units combined, meeting 15 percent of the total power supply. "All eight units were operational from 11am," plant director (technical) Nurul Alam told bdnews24.com. "With all the units operational, the power plant is currently able to supply 501 megawatts of power to the national grid, resulting in a reduction of load shedding," he said. The last time all units were operational together was January, 2006, Alam said. Technical glitches stopped production in a central unit last October, while power production in the other units faced interruption over the past two and a half years. bdnews24.com/
