<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com)  Detained former prime minister Khaleda Zia has asked the Election Commission about the bars on running in general elections on those not registered as voters, a senior prisons official said on Sunday. Deputy inspector general of prisons major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui said he had obtained necessary documents from the EC for Khaleda on Sunday. Siddiqui told reporters at the EC Secretariat Khaleda sought the documents from the EC through the prisons authorities. The Representation of the People (Amendment) Ordinance 2008 bars one from contesting the polls unless he or she is a voter. Election commissioner Muhammed Sohul Hussain on Sunday told reporters that people would be given an opportunity to enrol as voter even after the draft voter list had been prepared due to technical reason. He said the voter registration and correction in Dhaka City Corporation areas would end on Aug 11. "Khaleda Zia must register by the date," he added. He said the EC had asked the BNP chairperson seven times to become voter since the registration had started but she refused altogether. On Thursday, the chief election commissioner informed the prisons authorities that one would not be able to contest the national polls until he or she registered their name on the voter list. The prisons authorities informed Khaleda about the CEC's statement. Major Siddiqui said nine VIP prisoners had appealed to be voter so far. The prisons authorities have necessary preparation to make Khaleda voter. Steps will be taken once she agrees, he added. Thirty other VIPs including Khaleda's son Tarique Rahman has not applied for registration, he said. bdnew
