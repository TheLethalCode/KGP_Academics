 BEIJING, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Argentina forward Lionel Messi played -- and scored -- in his country's Olympic opener against Ivory Coast on Thursday after a late deal was struck with his Spanish club Barcelona. Argentina won the match 2-1 while their arch-rivals Brazil also started with a win, beating Belgium 1-0. Among others, Italy and USA also got off to winning starts. The world champions beat Honduras 3-0, with two penalty goals and the USA beat Japan 1-0. Four other matches on the first day of the event, which started a day before the official opening of the games, ended in draws. The Netherlands and Nigeria both failed to score, while the matches between hosts China and New Zealand, South Korea and Cameroon and Australia and Serbia ended 1-1. Almost pulled out of the competition by FC Barcelona, Messi scored in the 43rd minute at the Shanghai Olympic Stadium to give Argentina the lead. Sekou Cisse equalized with a powerful header in the 52nd. But Messi's shot set up the winner in the 85th, Lautaro Acosta turning the ball home after the Barcelona star's shot had been blocked by the goalkeeper. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled on Wednesday that Barcelona was not obliged to release him for the tournament -- raising the prospect that he could be called home. CAS upheld an appeal from the Spanish club after FIFA, soccer's world governing body, said clubs must release eligible players. Barcelona were keen to have Messi available for their Champions League qualifier against Poland's Wisla Krakow later this month but their sports director Txiki Begiristain told a news conference they had reached a deal over insurance and release from future friendly games. "We took the decision last night before we flew back from New York to Barcelona after hearing the decision from CAS. Messi will play the Olympics. "We spoke to the player first of all and with our coach Pep Guardiola. "We have an agreement that there is an insurance that will cover the whole of the player's salary if he is injured. "We also have the word of the Argentina Football Association president that he will be released from having to play friendlies for the whole of the season. "We wanted the player to be happy and he is," added Begiristain. Messi put Argentina 1-0 up against the African team with a 43rd minute goal. CAS upheld similar appeals from German clubs Schalke 04 and Werder Bremen regarding the release of Brazilian pair Rafinha and Dieg
