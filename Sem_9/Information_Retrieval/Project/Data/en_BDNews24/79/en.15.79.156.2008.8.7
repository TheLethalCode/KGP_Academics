 ISTANBUL, Thu Aug 7, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A mortar shell attack which reportedly injured three people in Istanbul on Thursday had targeted an army headquarters, broadcaster NTV reported security sources as saying. Four mortar shells were fired from a cemetery and workers at a nearby municipal building, initially thought to have been the attack's target, said they heard three explosions, state-run news agency Anatolian reported. Three of the shells landed in the cemetery and the fourth crashed into a refuse vehicle by the municipal building near Selimiye Barracks, headquarters of the First Army, which guards the border with Bulgaria and Greece. Security officials said they were investigating. The attack comes at a time of heightened tensions in Turkey after a court fined the ruling AK Party for anti-secular activities, but stopped short of closing it. A separate court case involving retired military officers accused of trying to trigger a coup has also heightened tensions and upset markets. Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan represents in parliament a district on the Asian side of Istanbul and has a house in the Uskudar district where the attack occurred on the Asian side. Police were searching for two people who escaped from the scene of the attack by motorcycle, Anatolian said. Two bombs detonated in an Istanbul neighborhood killed 17 people last week and six people were killed when three gunmen attacked the US Istanbul consulate last month. Bomb attacks are common in Turkey, often carried out by leftists, Kurdish separatists and Islamic radicals
