 BEIJING, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chisato Fukushima will become the first Japanese woman to run in the Olympic 100 metres for 56 years when she races in Beijing. Fukushima, who follows Ayako Yoshikawa's appearance in the 1952 Helsinki Games, equalled the national record of 11.36 seconds in April to achieve the "B" qualifying standard and was selected in July. "I've been given this chance, so if I can I want to help in the advancement of women's sprinting by breaking the Japan record and making it out of the first round," the 20-year-old said. "I'm suddenly in this situation, so it's tough to get used to. I didn't think I would be chosen but I set a goal of making the Beijing Olympics." The athletics competition starts on next Friday
