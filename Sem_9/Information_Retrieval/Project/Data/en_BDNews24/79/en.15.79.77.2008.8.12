<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 12 (bdnew24.com)The High Court has stayed the proceedings of a tax evasion case against BNP senior joint secretary general Tarique Rahman. The bench of Justice ABM Khairul Haque and Justice Md Abu Tariq passed the stay order on a writ petition by Tarique challenging the legality of the case filed by the National Board of Revenue. The court also asked the NBR chairman, deputy commissioner and Dhaka special judge's court to explain in six weeks why the case was not without legal basis. The NBR filed the case against Tarique with a Dhaka Special Judge's Court on Aug 4, accusing him of evading payment of Tk 26.86 lakh in income tax during the fiscal years 2002-03 to 2005-06. Barrister Rafique-ul-Huq, representing Tarique, said a notice had to be served before filing the tax evasion case, in line with income tax laws. "But in case of Tarique no such notice was served." The lawyer said Tarique was a registered taxpayer. "If there was any allegation of income tax evasion, the NBR would seek to recover that tax from him." "The High Court in an earlier hearing had ordered the NBR to collect Tarique's income tax, but they took no steps to collect it." Barrister Rafiq added that the duty of the NBR was to realise income tax, not to file cases. Tarique petitioned the High Court on Aug 10 challenging the legality of the case. bdnews24
