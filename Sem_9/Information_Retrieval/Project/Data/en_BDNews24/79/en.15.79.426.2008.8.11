<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com)The World Bank's International Finance Corporation is looking to a core group of public servants for solutions to investment barriers and their impact on foreign companies in Bangladesh. The Regulatory Reform Core Group (RRCG) will review relevant laws and assist the Regulatory Reforms Commission in making recommendations for their reform. The RRCG, formed under the aegis of the IFC, was formally launched Monday at a ceremony held at Sonargaon Hotel. RRC member Syed Manzoor-e-Elahi, speaking at the launch as chief guest, urged bureaucrats of different government agencies to be pro-active in attracting more foreign investment to Bangladesh . "China, a communist country, opened up its economy in the 1980s." "Owing to a pro-active bureaucracy, coupled with cheap labour and political stability, China attracted American and European investments," said Elahi, a former caretaker government adviser. Its economy boomed and poverty fell due to China's success in attracting foreign direct investment, he said. Terming Indian bureaucracy "very difficult", Elahi said China's economic rival has not been able to ensure the same level of FDI. He attributed India's latest economic success, however, to the prime minister Monmahan Singh who was the finance minister under Rajiv Gandhi. Mahbubur Rahman, president of the International Chamber of Commerce and Industries of Bangladesh, and Waliur Rahman Bhuiyan, president of the Federation of International Chamber of Commerce and Industries, also addressed the ceremony. The European Union and UK's Department for International Development (DFID) funded the launching of the core group. The caretaker government formed the Regulatory Reforms Commission (RRC) to make a review current laws and recommend necessary reforms to the government. The 17-member commission is headed by former caretaker government adviser Akbar Ali Khan. bdn
