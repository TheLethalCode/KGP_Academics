 BEIJING, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The hopes of more than a billion people will be resting on the delicate shoulders of China's Du Li in the first gold medal competition of the Olympics on Saturdaythe women's 10 metre air rifle. The home pressure is enormous for Du, who weighs 53 kg. Coach Wang Yifu hired a team psychologist to help Du, who won gold in Athens, and other China sharpshooters cope with the great expectations. "Home soil may be an advantage in other sports," Wang said. "But in shooting we call it the 'home venue curse'." He fears the crowd's Chinese whispers could distract his shooters as they can understand the chatter at homeunlike at foreign competitions. "Mother tongue interference and home venue pressure are the biggest obstacles," he said. The women's shooting final, the first of 15 events over the next nine days, traditionally produces the first gold medal  at about 10:50 a.m. (0250 GMT) on Saturday. IOC President Jacques Rogge is due at the shooting range hall to present the medals himself. Germany's Sonja Pfeilschifter, 37, has been humbled under Olympic pressure twice in the pastfinishing 5th and 6th in the last two Olympics despite being a favourite. This year Pfeilschifter is hoping that Du, 26, feels the heat at home. "The pressure is on China this time," Heiner Gabelmann, Germany's team manager, told Reuters. "But because it's the first medal, it's going to be a stressful situation for everyone. "Sonja won't go to the opening ceremonies. It won't be easy sleeping, though, because she's lives near the stadium and there will be lots of fireworks. Maybe she'll have a beer to relax." Also among the favourites are Athens' bronze winner Katarina Emmons of the Czech Republic, who was Katarina Kurkova before marrying U.S. shooter Matt Emmons, and Russia's Lioubov Galkina. In the men's 10 metres air pistol competition later on Saturday, world champion Pang Wei of China is the favourite alongside Vladimir Isakov of Russia and France's Franck Dumoulin. Since becoming an Olympic sport in 1896 shooting has been included in every Games except in 1904 and 1928. In 1984, women's shooting events were added. China dominated in 2004, winning four gold medals and nine in total while Russia had three gold and 10 medals. The United States, Germany, Italy and South Korea had three medals each. Shooting is popular in China. Xu Haiifeng became a hero in 1984 when he won China's first Olympic gold in Los Angeles. Xu ensured China's immediate impact when they returned after a 32-year absence caused by the controversy over the recognition of Taiwan
