 COLOMBO, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fast bowler Dammika Prasad claimed three for 49 on debut to reduce India to 104 for three at lunch on the first day of the third test against Sri Lanka on Friday. Prasad recovered from a nervous start with the new ball to dismiss Virender Sehwag (21), Rahul Dravid (10) and Sachin Tendulkar (six) after India won the toss and batted. Opener Gautam Gambhir continued his good form from the second test in Galle, which India won by 170 runs to level the series, reaching the break on 57 from 78 balls with nine boundaries. Saurav Ganguly was unbeaten on two at the break. India were given a flying start with Sehwag and Gambhir plundering boundaries off some wayward bowling from Prasad and Chaminda Vaas. Sri Lanka's fielders also missed early opportunities with Malinda Warnapura dropping Sehwag on 14 at short square leg following a Vaas bouncer. Tillakaratne Dilshan, fielding at point, also missed a run out chance a few minutes later when Sehwag backed up too far. However, Sri Lanka finally broke through when Prasad found the outside edge of Sehwag's bat with an outswinger. Prasad, who was rested briefly, returned to bag two more wickets before lunch. Dravid, initially given not out, was trapped lbw by an inswinger after Mahela Jayawardene called for an umpiring review. Tendulkar was also given out lbw to an inswinger, a decision against which was appealed unsuccessfully with television replays showing the ball missed bat. The three-match series is tied at 1-1
