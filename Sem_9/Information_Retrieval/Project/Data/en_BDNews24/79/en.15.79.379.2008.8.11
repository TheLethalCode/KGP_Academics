 Dhaka, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com)  The government has restored August 15 as National Mourning Day, the day independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was assassinated in 1975, in line with a court order, a government spokesman said on Sunday. The day will be a government holiday, said the chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim after an afternoon cabinet meeting at the CA's Office. Munaim said the cabinet had decided to abide by the High Court's July 27 ruling, which declared illegal the previous BNP-led government's cancellation of the government holiday and National Mourning Day on Aug 15. Acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman lauded the government for the decision. "It's a victory for the truth. The government made the right decision at the right time," Zillur told bdnews24.com on Sunday. Sheikh Rehana, daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and sister of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, told bdnews24.com that the government decision had fulfilled the hopes of the nation's 14 crore people. "It has been long overdue. I am grateful to Allah that it has happened," she said. The BNP-led alliance government in 2002 cancelled the mourning day and public holiday, which had been declared by the Awami League government in 1996. bdnews24.com/eh
