 BEIJING, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - As if the competition was not hot enough, Indonesia's Taufik Hidayat must overcome the lingering effects of a week-long bout with Dengue Fever if he hopes to defend his Olympic gold in badminton men's singles. The 26-year-old says he has no idea where he caught the mosquito-borne disease that causes fever, chills, headaches and can be fatal, but it landed him in hospital for six days. He was discharged last Monday. "After I came out from the hospital, the next day I trained. I have more motivation for the tournament after the Dengue," he told Reuters. "I'm ok  I'm not 100 percent. I don't know how many percent." But that did not appear to be a worry. "In men's singles," he said, "everybody has a chance for the gold medal." Indeed, no one competitor dominates the event, although the world's number one and two playersChina's Lin Dan and Malaysia's Lee Chong Weiare favoured and have done well this year. Denmark's Peter Gade and South Korean team mates Park Sung-hwan and Lee Hyun-il also pose threats in the men's singles. Taufik, known for his fiery outbursts on court, has seen his form dipeven before the fever. On Wednesday, he was breathing heavily during practice and stopping regularly to rest. His first game will be on Mondaya day after he turns 27. Competition kicks off on Saturday with a women's singles match pitting Juliane Schenk of Germany against Indonesia's Maria Kristin Yulianti, a finalist in this year's Uber Cup. As in the Uber Cup, though, China is expected to be the country to beat in the women's game, dominating the world rankings and enjoying home court advantage in what is traditionally China's strongest event. In men's doubles, top seeds Markis Kido and Hendra Setiawan of Indonesia, reigning world champions, face China's second pair Xie Zhongbo and Guo Zhendong in round one. China's top pair Cai Yun and Fu Haifeng first meet Martin Lundgaard Hansen and Jens Eriksen of Denmark
