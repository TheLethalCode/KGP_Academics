<TEXT>
 BEIJING, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China's "young general" Liao Hui won the Olympic weightlifting gold in the 69kg class on Tuesday after a brutal fight during which at least two contenders injured themselves and one returned to attempt another lift. Liao, whose parents initially did not want him to become a weightlifter because they feared he would end up short and squat, snatched 158kg and lifted 190kg in the clean and jerk. He won with a combined total of 348kg. In what local media dubbed a "double insurance" plan for gold, China put up the relatively inexperienced Liao as well as the more experienced "old general" Shi Zhiyong, the 2004 Olympic champion in the 62kg class. Liao was watched by his first coach, Gan Yougui, who recruited him in the rural province of Hubei at the age of 10. "My family was adamantly opposed to my becoming a weightlifter, but coach Gan was extremely stubborn and visited my family three times to persuade them," the 20-year-old Liao told reporters. "They had this traditional idea that weightlifting makes you short and squat." He said Gan treated him like a son, even buying nutritious food such as beef for him because his family could not afford it. Chinese spectators cheered for both homegrown medal hopefuls, hoping they would secure two medals for the Olympic host. But Shi pulled out of the competition after injuring his lower back in the snatch. Vencelas Dabaya-Tientcheu from France won the silver. Knowing that he had already secured the medal with his first 187kg lift in the clean and jerk, he went on to try 197kg. But he dropped the weights mid-air in one attempt, and in the following try merely walked up to the barbells, looked at them and walked away. "It was impossible," he said after the competition. "It was very difficult, mentally." Tigran Martirosyan from Armenia took the bronze. Despite the sure-fire recipe for another China gold, the competition was fierce, with lifters testing their limits as they stretched for a medal. Korean Lee Bae-Young folded under 184kg in the clean and jerk, his leg twisting under him. Volunteers and a doctor rushed to the mat and surrounded him with screens until he stood up and hobbled away. He came back and tried in vain to the lift the same weigh
