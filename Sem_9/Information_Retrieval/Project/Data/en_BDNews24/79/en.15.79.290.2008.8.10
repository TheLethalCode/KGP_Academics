 Tblisi, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia bombed a military airport outside the Georgian capital early on Sunday and Tbilisi said Moscow was massing troops in a second breakaway region of Georgia as fighting raged for control of South Ossetia. There were signs of a second front opening in the conflict, with Georgia accusing Russia of sending troops by sea to the larger rebel region of Abkhazia on the Black Sea. A U.N. peacekeeping official also warned of an imminent military offensive by the Abkhaz who, like the South Ossetians, broke with Tbilisi in the early 1990s after a war. Russia bombed Georgia's military airport 12 km (8 miles) from Tbilisi early on Sunday, the latest target in a Russian air assault on its small neighbor following a Georgian push to re-take the pro-Moscow enclave of South Ossetia. A Georgian ceasefire offer went unheeded by Moscow and separatists in the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali reported that Georgian forces, dug in on high ground outside the town, were continuing to fire on the town. "The Georgians have dug in at the heights and they don't want to leave. Our fighters, aided by the Russians, have been trying to flush them out of there," Irina Gagloyeva, spokeswoman for the rebel administration, told Reuters by telephone. She said there was a break in shooting in the early hours. An EU-U.S. delegation headed for Georgia to try to broker an end to the conflict in the heart of the volatile Caucasus, where Russia and the West are vying for influence over crucial oil and gas supply routes. Russia poured troops into Georgia on Friday, dramatically upping the stakes in a long-running stand-off with the ex-Soviet republic over its pro-Western policies and its drive for NATO membership. Thwe confrontation has sparked alarm in the West and led to angry exchanges at the U.N. reminiscent of the Cold War. HUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHE "Georgia faces a humanitarian catastrophe," Georgian Interior Ministry official Shota Utiashvili said. Georgia said that overnight, Russia had landed 4,000 troops by sea to the coast of Black Sea Abkhazia, the larger of Georgia's two breakaway regions. In New York, a top U.N. peacekeeping official said there were indications the Abkhaz were preparing to launch a military offensive against Georgian special forces in the upper Kodori gorge in northern Abkhazia. "At this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond South Ossetia into Abkhazia," U.N. assistant secretary-general for peacekeeping Edmond Mulet told reporters. Utiashvili said in the past few hours Russia had brought 6,000 troops into Georgia and a further 4,000 troops by sea. "All of them are waiting for dawn to start active actions," he told Reuters. He said three bombs had been dropped on a military airfield at a plant producing Sukhoi Su-25 ground fighters. No one was hurt, but the impact could be heard in downtown Tbilisi. Separatist spokeswoman Gagloyeva said that though Georgian forces were keeping up pressure on Tskhinvali the Russians were in control of the town. "Russia's aid arrived a bit too late and the town was completely destroyed. We don't have Tskhinvali anymore," she said. "TOTALLY LEGITIMATE" In a statement, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he was "profoundly concerned over mounting tensions in the Abkhaz zone." Russia was unbowed by Western criticism of its military offensive. "Russia's actions in South Ossetia are totally legitimate," Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said, visiting an adjacent region of Russia to which thousands of refugees have fled. Putin said Georgia's bid to join the Western alliance NATO -- anathema to Moscow -- was part of the problem. "Georgia's aspiration to join NATO ... is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures," he said, adding that Georgian action bore "elements of some kind of genocide against the Ossetians." Russian officials said the death toll in fighting that began on Thursday stood at 2,000. Georgia said on Friday that it had lost up to 300 people killed, mainly civilians. Tbilisi said Moscow was pouring troops in the Java gorge leading from Russia down through South Ossetia towards the capital, Tskhinvali. Russia is the main backer of South Ossetian separatists and the majority of the population, ethnically distinct from Georgians, have been given Russian passports since the enclave broke with Tbilisi in the early 1990s. Putin said more than 30,000 refugees from South Ossetia had fled over the border in the past 36 hours. Russian officials said two of Moscow's warplanes had been shot down, 13 soldiers killed and 70 wounded. "The attacks are occurring in regions of Georgia far from the zone of conflict in South Ossetia. They mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis," U.S. President George W. Bush said at the Olympics in Beijing. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev told Bush by phone the only solution was for Georgian troops to quit the conflict zone. Georgia's parliament approved a state of war across the country for the next 15 days, while Russia accused the West of contributing to the violence by supplying Georgia with arms.
