<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Thursday stayed the enforcement of the Election Commission's gazette on the redrawing of parliamentary constituencies for three months. The HC also issued a rule nisi on the government and the Election Commission asking them to explain why the gazette on the delimitation of the constituencies should not be declared illegal. The chief election commissioner, two commissioners, EC secretary and the chief secretary to the chief adviser have been given two weeks to explain. Asked for an immediate reaction on the ruling, chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda told reporters: "We will have to see the High Court order, and give a reply after that." "But the stay order should not create any problem for the process that has already been completed," the CEC added. A High Court bench of justices Khademul Islam Chowdhury and Masuk Hossain Ahmed issued the stay order on a writ petition filed by Abdul Mannan, former MP from Dhaka-2 constituency. Mannan said after the ruling that he had filed the writ petition as the gazette curtailed people's electoral rights. Barrister Rafikul Islam, counsel for the petitioner, said the 8th parliamentary elections should be held in line with the previous drawing of parliamentary constituencies Rafikul suggested that a census could be held according to electoral laws after the national elections, and the redrawing could take place then. Voter lists would have to be updated after the delimitation of constituencies, he added. The petition had argued that though parliamentary constituencies could legally be redrawn prior to the preparation of voter lists, the gazette relating to the demarcation of constituencies was published after 99 percent of voters had been registered. It was therefore illegal and unconstitutional, it said. The function of the Election Commission was to hold elections, not to delimit constituencies, the petitioner claimed. The EC published the gazette on the delimitation of 133 constituencies on April 29. The HC, on a previous petition by Abdul Mannan, issued a rule nisi on May 12 asking the EC and the government to explain why the decision to redraw 133 constituencies should not be declared illegal. bdnew
