 BEIJING, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ace Spanish forward Pol Amat is making his family's 20th Olympic appearance in Beijing, hoping Spain's "golden year" for sport will continue as he competes in his fourth and final Games. "My father played three Olympic Games. My three uncles played three, three and four. My cousin played three Olympic Games too," Amat told Reuters after training on Thursday. "I don't know if it is one (the only) case in the world. This amount of Games. It is special and a tradition in the family." The hockey events start on Sunday and Spanish men, twice silver medallists, are strong contenders as they chase their country's first Olympic hockey gold. They are hoping to build on a sequence of recent Spanish sporting successes. Carlos Sastre won the Tour de France, the soccer team bagged the Euro 2008 for the first time in 44 years and Rafael Nadal became the first Spaniard to win Wimbledon in more than 40 years. "In Spain we are seeing the golden year in sports  Nadal, Euro. I hope we also follow the trail," Amat said. The 30-year-old, known for his blistering acceleration, comes from a family steeped in hockey tradition. Juan, an uncle, was a renowned penalty corner specialist who played in four Olympics from 1968 and won silver in Moscow in 1980. A gold will complete the medals sequence and Amat said he will go all out for it. "Two bronze medals, three silvers (in the family). In Beijing, (it) is my last opportunity to get a gold for the family. Of course, we will try hard to get it," he said. Amat made his international debut at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, where Spain won silver and he soon rose to become one of the finest forwards in the contemporary game. Spain, who finished fourth at the 2004 Olympics, were runners-up to Australia in the recent Champions Trophy. Amat said defending champions Australia were the side to beat, although there was little difference between the world's top teams. "I think the top five teams in the rankings are so close that anyone can win. The slightest mistake will count." Amat, who took five months leave from work as an accounts advisor to prepare for his final Games, said modern hockey was becoming increasing demanding on players. "It's so hard combining hockey and work," he said. "Hockey is so professional now. My office gave me a break to prepare for the Olympics. The last five months I was only focusing on hockey.
