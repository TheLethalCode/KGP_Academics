 BEIJING, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Winning Olympic archery gold could be like taking candy from a baby for South Korea's women, but the race for the men's titles is wide open. U.S. head coach Lee Ki-sik, who has been described as the "Guus Hiddink of archery", said South Korea's women had a supreme air of confidence that made them practically unbeatable. "South Korea's women are at such a high level they feel that even if they miss with an arrow, they can always get it back with the next one," Lee told Reuters on Wednesday. "It's like they are adults shooting with elementary school children. No one can beat them with that kind of confidence." And they have good reason to be confident. South Korea have won every gold medal in women's archery since the 1984 Games. Park Sung-hyun is the reigning Olympic champion, while Yun Ok-hee set a world record of 119 points from a possible 120 at a World Cup meeting in Turkey in May. However, China pushed the Koreans to the very last arrow in the team event in Athens four years ago and will have a shot at gold in their own backyard, while Italy's world champion Natalia Valeeva could also cause an upset in the individual competition. "But the men's event is very close," said Lee, who coached South Korea until the Atlanta Games before moving to Austrlia and the United States. Australia's Simon Fairweather won gold under Lee's tutelage in Sydney. "South Korea are the best but the gap is closing. And this is the Olympics so anything can happen." The pressure will be on world number one Im Dong-hyun to win South Korea's first men's individual title, but the world champion is not short of rivals. Athens champion Marco Galiazzo (Italy) and world No.2 Baljinima Tsyrempilov (Russia) are obvious contenders but Sky Kim of Australia and young American Brady Ellison also have their sights set on gold. Kim won the Beijing test event last year while 19-year-old Ellison took silver in the third World Cup stage in Turkey in May, despite only competing with the Olympic-style recurve bow for two years
