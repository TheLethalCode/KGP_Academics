 Dhaka, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh will accept a US proposal to assist in securing 539 kilometres of the national border, which remain unguarded, by linking remote border outposts, a home ministry official said. The home adviser MA Matin told reporters that a home ministry meeting Monday had discussed the US proposal for improvement of infrastructure and security systems as well as the efficiency of Bangladesh Rifles. Asked whether the meeting discussed the prevailing tensions between BDR and India's Border Security Force, Matin replied in the negative. A ministry official, who attended the meeting, said the US had proposed financial assistance to help secure Bangladesh's remote border outposts and that a US delegation has already visited Bangladesh in this regard. Monday's meeting discussed their observations and opinions, he said, adding that the government would give importance on financial assistance for construction of link roads in inaccessible and unprotected borders, development of infrastructure and financial assistance for transport. Home adviser MA Matin presided; home secretary Abdul Karim, additional secretary Sheikh Abdur Rashid, officials of Bangladesh Police, BDR, the foreign ministry, other concerned ministries and divisions and different intelligence agencies were present. bdnew
