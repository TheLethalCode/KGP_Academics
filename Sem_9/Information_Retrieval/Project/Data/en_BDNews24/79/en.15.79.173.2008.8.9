<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan (BKSP) created the first upset in the Citycell Federation Cup when they handed a 1-0 defeat to Sheikh Russel Krira Chakra Saturday at Bangabandhu National Stadium. Captain Sabuj scored the decisive goal in the 30th minute with a superb right-footer outside the box to put Sheikh Russel in a little difficult position for the last eight qualifications from Group C, which also includes holders Brothers Union. The students from country's lone sports educational institute adopted a counter-attack strategy to come out successful against Sheikh Russel's all-out attack. Keeping the backline marshalled by Russel, Saikat, Konok and Any in a rock-solid position, BKSP often broke Sheikh Russel's off-side traps to threaten the giants, who had apparently attacked through the wings, but they hardly got the dividend. Sheikh Russel, one of four big-budgeted teams this season, went on an aggressive attack with controlling the midfield and came close to scoring in the 11th minute, but Moroccan striker Touati Youness's feeble shot, that beat BKSP goalkeeper Mostaque, was finally cleared by defender Konok. Capitalising on a through pass from Royel, BKSP's Sabuj turned left leaving his marker Jahirul Islam to his right and found the back of the opponent net with a right-footer to give the minnows a 30-minute lead. Two minutes later, Sheikh Russel's striker Alfaz Ahmed got into a better position to connect a Saiful Islam cross from the right, but his close-range header narrowly sailed over the BKSP post. After the break, Sheikh Russel went on an all-out attack and came close to levelling the margin twice, but only one shot rattled the BKSP crossbar while the other floated over the bar. Two minutes into the second half, Tanvir whipped in a cross from the left and Touati rose high, but saw his well-judged header denied by the crossbar while the Moroccan striker missed a scoring chance in the 54th minute, floating an Alfaz cross over the unmarked BKSP post. BKSP should have doubled the lead in the 65th minute but Sabuj and Sabbir missed the golden chance. Sabuj receiving a defense-splitting pass from Rana beat Sheikh Russel goalkeeper Titu and found himself in a difficult position and he had to minus it to substitute Sabbir, whose late shot was blocked by defender Jahirul from the goalline. Keeper Mostaque played a vital role under the BKSP post and denied Sheikh Russel twice in the second-half as he thwarted a Bulbul drive for a corner in the 78th minute and two minutes later gripped Manwar's eight-yard shot. BSKP almost doubled their margin from a counter attack four minutes from time as Sabuj shrugging off a Russel defender drove a low shot from the right, but unfortunately his drive was cut short by the sidebar. In the second match, holders Brothers Union made a fine start with an easy 2-0 win over Victoria Sporting Club. Rezaul Karim Liton converted a penalty shot to give the Gopibagh-based outfit a 23-minute lead while Ariful Kabir Farhad sealed the match in the 42nd minute.
