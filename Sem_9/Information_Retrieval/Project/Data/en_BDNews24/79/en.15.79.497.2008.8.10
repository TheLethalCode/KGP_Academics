 BEIJING, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Defending champions Romania blamed a combination of tiredness and harsh judging for their mediocre results in women's gymnastics qualifying at the Olympics on Sunday. Romania were in the first of the day's rotation groups, finishing second behind title favourites China by a considerable 9.850 points and head coach Nicolae Forminte said his gymnasts seemed to be feeling the effects of the early start. "There was a definite influence on the girls to feel emotional and tired and this may be taken as a disadvantage for them to compete at this hour," Forminte told reporters. They may have to get used to early starts because many of the finals in Beijing are being held during the day, rather than the more common evening sessions. The Romanians struggled on their weakest apparatus, the asymmetric bars, and were shaky on the balance beam, where they usually shine. Andreea Acatrinei fell off the 10-cm wide beam, while world silver medallist Steliana Nistor wobbled on moves she normally nails with confidence. Forminte said the errors were severely punished. "It was a difficult competition, maybe the judging was a bit severe. It's the first rotation so maybe they want to judge everything a bit harsher," he said. The Romanian women won four gold medals at the Athens Games four years ago but have since struggled for form, with a revamped team missing the podium for the first time in 25 years at the 2006 world championships
