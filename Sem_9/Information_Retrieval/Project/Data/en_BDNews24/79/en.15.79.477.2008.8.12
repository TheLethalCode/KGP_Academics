 KARACHI, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The International Cricket Council (ICC) said on Monday it might hold the Champions Trophy at just two venues in Pakistan next month for security reasons. Haroon Lorgat, the ICC chief executive, told reporters in Rawalpindi there was a strong possibility that the Rawalpindi cricket stadium might be dropped as one of the venues for the event, which starts on Sept. 11. Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) sources had already suggested last week that Rawalpindi could be dropped as the stadium might not be ready in time. Lahore and Karachi are the other two venues for the Champions Trophy. Some teams and players have said they are reluctant to play in Pakistan which has been hit by a series of suicide bombings this year. Lorgat said the Rawalpindi stadium had not been used in the Asia Cup. "That didn't provide us with the opportunity to test the security arrangements. We will explore whether we would only use Karachi and Lahore," he said during a visit by an ICC task force. "We want to see whether that would enhance the security situation for us at those two venues and it may be decided that we would not use Pindi at all. It is not finalised but it is a strong possibility," Lorgat added. "Pakistan is the host country and Sri Lanka is the alternate venue but at this stage the decision of the board is to host the CT in Pakistan," he said
