<TEXT>
 By Peter Rutherford BEIJING, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Athens gold medallist Marco Galiazzo of Italy was knocked out of the men's Olympic individual archery by Britain's Alan Wills and South Korean Lee Chang-hwan set an Olympic record to advance on Wednesday. Lee's team mates, Im Dong-hyun and Park Kyung-mo, also sailed through to the next round. Wills was the only British archer to survive to the last 16 and beating Galiazzo clearly gave the 27-year-old a huge confidence boost. "Marco is one of the best in the world," he told reporters. "I beat him so I feel like I can beat anybody. So bring it on!" Fellow Britons Simon Terry and Laurence Godfrey went out in the first round. "I'm just trying to do the boys proud," Wills said. "They had a rough day today so I'm just trying to do my best to help Britain." Galiazzo will return to Italy with the team silver but still found it hard to swallow not winning gold. "We got silver in the team but it feels like a joke," he said. "We were touching the gold medal and at the last arrow it was as if the Koreans said: 'Say arrivederci to the gold.'" South Korean Lee, who won the gold in the team event on Monday, shot 117 to break compatriot Oh Kyo-moon's record for 12 arrows (115) set at the Atlanta Games. "I knew my score was high but I didn't realise it was the new Olympic record," he said. "I didn't even know what the Olympic record was." The South Koreans are favourites to vie for the gold medal in an event they have never won, despite the women winning every individual gold since 1984
