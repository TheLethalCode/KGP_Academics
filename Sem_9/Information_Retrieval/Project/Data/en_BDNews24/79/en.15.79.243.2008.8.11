 Dhaka, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com)  The fate of BRTC's 21 players hangs in balance as the Bangladesh Road and Transport Corporation's team opted to pull out of the upcoming 2nd Division Football League, beginning from Aug 20. "We are worried about our future as the BRTC officials told us that they had decided to pull out of the league this season," said one of dejected players, who Monday turned up at the Bangladesh Football Federation to seek their interference. The BRTC football team signed up 14 players along with seven old men during a four-day player transfers from July 25 to 28. The players told reporters that BRTC football secretary Abdul Latif had promised them to pay the amount after the completion of the transfers and we agreed to do this. But he was now telling us that the communications secretary had asked them to refrain from forming a football team, added one footballer who has been playing for the side for three seasons. The young footballers said that they had requested the club officials to start the camp and give them the amounts on the basis of performances.
