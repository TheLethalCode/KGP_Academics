 Wana, Pakistan,Aug 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least five militants were killed in a missile strike on their training camp in Pakistan's South Waziristan region, near the Afghan border, security officials and residents said on Wednesday. US forces stationed in Afghanistan have carried out several missile attacks this year in Pakistan's border regions, known as sanctuaries for al Qaeda and Taliban militants. Last month, al Qaeda chemical and biological weapons expert Abu Khabab al-Masri was killed in a similar strike in South Waziristan. The latest attack took place on Tuesday night in Bhagar, about 35 km (22 miles) west of Wana, the main town in the region, they said. An intelligence official in South Waziristan, who declined to be identified, told Reuters that at least four missiles were fired from across the border hitting one of two militant training camps. "This camp was run by Hizb-e-Islami and there were about 15 people including foreigners there at the time of the attack," he said referring to a militant faction allied with the Taliban. Residents said the mud-and-brick compound had been destroyed and at least eight bodies recovered from the rubble. Military spokesman were not available for comment
