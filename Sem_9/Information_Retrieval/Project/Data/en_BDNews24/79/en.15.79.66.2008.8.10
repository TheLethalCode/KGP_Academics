 BEIJING, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - American James Blake became the first player through to the second round on Sunday after rain delayed the start of the Olympic tennis event. Eighth seed Blake, making his debut at the Olympics and his country's best hope of a men's singles medal, beat Australian left-hander Chris Guccione 6-3 7-6 on Centre Court. Earlier, scores of volunteers armed with towels had mopped up the courts at the brand new Olympic Tennis Centre after steady rain had delayed the 10:30 a.m. (0230 GMT) scheduled start time. Play eventually got under way on the main show courts after a hold-up of more than two and a half hours. Organisers were confident of making up the lost time. Both players received enthusiastic support on the 10,000-seater Centre Court, shaped like the petals of the lotus flower, although the impressive arena was by no means full. Blake took just 23 minutes to win the first set but had to work hard in the second. He saved a set points at 5-6 before sealing victory in the tiebreak. Chile's Fernando Gonzales, a singles bronze and doubles gold medallist four years ago in Athens, also reached the second round with a 6-4 6-4 defeat of China's Sun Peng. Both singles and doubles matches were being played on Sunday, with men's top seed Roger Federer of Switzerland one of many highlights when he plays later against Russian Dmitry Tursunov. Tennis is celebrating the 20th anniversary of its return to the Olympic family in Seoul
