 SRINAGAR, India, Fri Aug 8, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police placed three Kashmiri separatist leaders under house arrest on Friday as they prepared to lead protests against what they call attacks on Muslims and an economic blockade by Hindu demonstrators. Hindus in Kashmir's winter capital of Jammu, demanding the state government transfer forest land to Amarnath shrine trust, have attacked lorries carrying essential supplies to the Kashmir valley. The controversy over the issue of land for the trust has polarised Indian Kashmir, split between the Muslim-majority Kashmir valley and the Hindu-dominated region around Jammu city. "They were scheduled to lead protest demonstrations after Friday prayers. For precautionary measures they have been placed under house arrest," Imtiyaz Ahmad, a police official said, referring to three senior separatist leaders. Police arrested the leaders to try and defuse protests they say could turn violent. Those under house arrest included the chairman of the separatist alliance All Parties Hurriyat (Freedom) Conference Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, the more hardline Syed Ali Shah Geelani and another popular separatist leader, Shabir Shah. The land row has sparked some of Kashmir's worst religious riots since a separatist Muslim revolt against New Delhi broke out in 1989. At least eight people have died and hundreds have been injured in protests. The dispute began after the Kashmir government had promised to give forest land to the trust that runs Amarnath, a cave shrine visited by Hindu pilgrims. Many Muslims were enraged. The government then backed down on its decision. Many Hindus, in turn, were angered in Jammu, the winter capital of the region, which is under curfew for most of the week. Undeterred by over a month-long religious violence, Hindu pilgrims trekked daily through icy streams and frozen mountain passes to 3,800 metres high Amarnath cave shrine. Officials say a record number of nearly 550,000 Hindu pilgrims travelled to the cave shrine this year to worship an ice stalagmite, believed to be the symbol of Lord Shiva, the Hindu god of destruction and regeneration
