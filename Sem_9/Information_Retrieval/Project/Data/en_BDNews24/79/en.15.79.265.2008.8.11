 Dhaka, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com)  The GP-BCB National Cricket Academy recorded a stunning three-run win over South Africa Academy in the first of two four-day matches Monday in Pretoria. The Academy team wrapped up hosts for 77 runs in the fourth innings. Chasing a paltry target of 81, the GP-BCB bowlers, led by pacer Mahbubul Alam Robin, damaged the hosts in just 23.1 overs that also gave the visitors a 1-0 lead in the two-match series. Mahbub, who retuned four for 86 in the first innings, again claimed four giving away just 38 runs and took his match tally to eight. The tall pacer was assisted by fellow pacers Shafaq-al-Jabir and Ziaur Rahman, who spanned two wickets each for 12 and 19 respectively in the second inning. Captain Surawardi Shuvo took a wicket for seven runs while the other batsman was run out. Earlier on the third day, Marshall Ayub hammered an unbeaten 73 that guided the GP-BCB Academy team to 237 runs in the second innings. The tourist made 217 runs in the first innings in reply to South Africa's 374.
