<TITLE> China parades torch on Wall </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIJING, Thu Aug 7,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China paraded the Olympic torch along its ancient Great Wall on Thursday a day before the opening of the Games that Beijing wants to show its modern face but which have also galvanised global protests over rights. Doves flew and confetti rained down on the flame as runners carried it over the Wall's mist-shrouded ramparts at daybreak in a tradition dating back to the 1936 Berlin Olympics. On Friday, the torch will enter the Bird's Nest stadium for the opening ceremony of the 16-day Olympics. En route to China, US President George W Bush used some of his bluntest language yet in criticising a country many view as likely to rival his own for global hegemony this century. And some 40 competing athletes petitioned China to find a peaceful solution for Tibet, the most contentious issue. Away from the politics, some sport was already underway. After China's women's soccer team delighted the host nation with a win on Wednesday, the men's competition began on Thursday. A Ronaldinho-led Brazil, which has never won Olympic gold in soccer despite its five World Cup triumphs, beat Belgium 1-0. South America's other soccer power-house Argentina kicked off later against Ivory Coast, with forward Lionel Messi in the lineup despite Barcelona's reluctance to release him. In tennis, which starts on Sunday, rivals Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer both seemed out-of-sorts. Nadal said he had rested little since a five-set thriller that won him Wimbledon, but he still hoped to win a medal for Spain. "I'm very tired but I'm OK, all things considered." Federer complained constant attention from athletes had forced him to leave the Olympic Village. "It is impossible really, there are so many athletes asking for photos and so on." Across China, excitement has built as the tortuous and troubled torch relay draws to a close and the country's 1.3 billion people prepare for the Olympics' most expensive opening ceremony. The Games have cost Beijing a total of $40 billion. Officially-organised but wildly excited crowds cheered the torch through Beijing this week in images China hopes will erase memories of the Tibet protests on its international tour. "There have been problems with the torch -- but now is the time for the party!" said Weng Chengyu, a 28-year-old student among the dancing, singing crowds on the Great Wall. EYES ON THE SKIES Smog and sweltering heat remain a concern for athletes, though neither are unique to Beijing. Skies were hazy again on Thursday, but authorities, who spent $18 billion on cleanup moves, said air quality was fairly good. August is thunderstorm season in Beijing, and organisers have talked of using experimental technology to "seed" rain clouds to ensure it stays dry for Friday's opening. China's 7ft 6in basketball player Yao Ming will carry the host nation's flag at that ceremony. The two Koreas have failed to agree a joint march, as they did in 2000 and 2004. Undeterred by a 100,000-strong security force in Beijing, small groups of protesters have popped up this week to demonstrate over Tibet, abortion and animal rights. In the latest, plainclothes security officials dragged away three American Christian activists on Thursday after they attempted to protest for religious freedom in Tiananmen Square. Despite saying he was coming to Beijing for sports not politics, President Bush delivered a speech in Bangkok on Thursday voicing "firm opposition" to China's detention of dissidents, human rights advocates and religious activists. "The United States believes the people of China deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings," he said. Beijing defended its record, saying people enjoyed a range of freedoms. But it added a warning: "We resolutely oppose any words or actions which interfere in the internal affairs of another country in the name of issues such as human rights and religion." Many Chinese have been offended by criticism of their nation ahead of the Games they view as a moment of national glory. "Through the prism of the international media we are getting a pretty negative impression of China," said John Dewry, at the Asia Society in New York. "People who watch things closely in China will see the real story was the world being a bad guest." Doping dominated the start of Athens 2004. But the International Olympic Committee said nobody was positive in 650 tests conducted so far on athletes reaching China
