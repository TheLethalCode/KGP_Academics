<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com)  Gas starved Chittagong will soon get a ready-to-deliver oil-fired power plant, the cabinet decided Wednesday at a meeting held in the port city. The advisers also promised to pump more natural gas into the region to prop up industries and cleared plans to form a new distribution company. But a proposed coal policy was sent back to its authors, the energy ministry. Resolving Chittagong's power and gas crises dominated the agenda of Wednesday's cabinet meeting. The council of advisers also took up a variety of plans to solve water shortages and rid the city of water-logging. After a three-hour session at the Circuit House auditorium, the chief adviser told a press briefing that a rental power plant based on furnace oil would be set up soon in the city to solve power crisis. The government would buy electricity from the plant and sell it to people at a subsidised price, the CA said. Fakhruddin said the cabinet also decided to ensure further gas supplies to the city of 20 million cubic feet a day, in the interests of industry, and approved the formation of the Karnaphuli Gas Distribution Company in Chittagong. The Chittagong meeting also broadly discussed the national coal policy, which in the end was sent back to the energy ministry with further suggestions to again be placed before the cabinet at a later date, the CA said. Terming Chittagong port the 'centre point' of the country's economy, Fakhruddin said the government would amend and formulate laws to keep up development of the port. Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman told the briefing that a national committee led by the chief adviser had received a number of recommendations relating to gas, power and water crises in Chittagong. He said the 20 million cubic feet of gas for the city would come from the fields of Bangura and Bakhrabad as gas shortages were eroding new investment in the city. Ten million cubic feet of gas would be supplied to newly-established industries on the basis of the size of investment and the remaining 10 million would be used to generate power, he said. Meanwhile, Chittagong City Corporation, Chittagong Development Authority, and Chittagong Port Authority are to jointly implement projects to tackle water-logging, the adviser said. Work on two new sluice gates is likely to start by the end of September after verifying the possibility of developing the city's drainage system, he added. The cabinet also discussed a Tk 95 crore city infrastructure and drainage system development project and Tk 22 crore effluent management project in the meeting. Two model school and colleges would be set up in the city, said Hossain Zillur, who also oversees the ministry of education. The cabinet in addition approved six new road development projects in principle. Modernising the quarantine plant and laboratory at Chittagong port, setting up an IT building in the city, constructing a gymnasium for Chittagong University were among the other issues on the cabinet meeting's agenda. bdnews2
