 Dhaka, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com) -- Bangladesh Chhatra League general secretary Mahfuzul Haider Chowdhury Roton was released on Thursday after days of violent campaign on Dhaka University campus followed by a meeting between DU vice chancellor and the chief adviser late Wednesday. Roton was released shortly after 4pm, Mymensingh additional police super Akhteruzzaman told bdnews24.com. A leader of the Awami League-backed student organisation had said that Roton had been taken to a Mymensingh court and was on the way to be freed. Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal president Azizul Bari Helal was also freed earlier in the day, after DU VC SMA Faiz assured BCL and JCD late Wednesday night their two leaders would be released the following day. Faiz's assurance came after a meeting with the chief adviser, forced by a series of violent campaign by BCL activists on the campus and a three-hour confinement of the VC inside his office on Tuesday. The VC met with the interim government head after the JCD joined the BCL to announce a plan to besiege the home ministry Thursday demanding release of the leaders, proctor AK Firoze told bdnews24.com. The vice chancellor spoke to the student activists at 8:40pm, although he was earlier given until 7pm by BCL activists to redress the arrest of Roton on charges of violating emergency powers rules. He spoke to the student leaders for about 20 minutes before leaving to meet with the chief adviser. The BCL adherents however stayed in front of the VC's residence until 10pm even after he had left. Earlier, hundreds of BCL activists staged a sit-in in front of the VC's office to pressure authorities into releasing Roton. They later withdrew after the VC sought time until 7pm to make headway with the release. BCL acting general secretary Syed Abdul Kalam told bdnews24.com that the VC had talks with the government high-ups about the release of the BCL leader. Earlier in the day, Roton's father Afsar Uddin Haider Chowdhury met the VC. The BCL on Tuesday called a strike at Dhaka University for Wednesday for the same cause only to call it off shortly afterwards on assurance by university authorities that their demand would be taken care of. Earlier in the same day, the activists confined the VC for three hours inside his office. About 150 adherents surrounded the VC's office in the administrative building at around 4pm, demanding release of Roton from Mymensingh jail. BCL's DU president Sheikh Sohel Rana Tipu told bdnews24.com that the strike was called off "for the time being", after the VC requested time until Wednesday noon to resolve the issue. BCL activist Shamsul Kabir Rahat told bdnews24.com Tuesday that Roton had been freed from Mymensingh jail at about 10:30am Tuesday, and was kept seated in the visiting room of the jail. Police later rearrested him from the visiting room at around 2:30pm, Rahat said. The news prompted the BCL leaders and supporters to march on to the VC's office, under the banner of "Human Rights Conscious Students", saying they would continue their protest until action was taken about Roton. The activists had earlier damaged teachers' vehicles parked outside of the administrative building, and locked the main gates with the vice chancellor and other university officials held inside. Joint forces arrested Roton on Jan 18, 2007, on charges of violating Emergency Powers Rules. BCL observed a 24-hour token hunger strike demanding his release on Sunday. bdnews24.com/
