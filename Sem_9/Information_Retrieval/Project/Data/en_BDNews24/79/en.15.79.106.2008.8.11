<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com)  The garment manufacturers on Monday said the government 'fully failed' to provide security to the billion-dollar readymade garment industry, in an outburst of anger after Sunday's arson at a city factory. "The government has completely failed to provide security to the garment factories. One after another garment factory is coming under arson attack. But the government is not taking any action," BGMEA president Anwar-ul-Alam Chowdhury Parvez said at a press conference. "We've repeatedly appealed (to the government) but to no avail. Earlier the factories that did not pay regularly came under attack. Now the good factories are being marked out in a planned way for attack." "The factory owners pay salary to the workers and employees on the 10th of every month. It is one of the biggest garment factories in the country. It has no overdue salary. Some terrorists posing as workers set the factory afire in front of police." Mim Design Sweater Factory was burned to the ground Sunday evening after hours of violence since afternoon. Parvez said the BGMEA and the owners had asked government agencies to prevent, attack, ransacking and arson in n the factory but received no help from them. Chairman of Mim Design Garments Mizanur Rahman Khan and Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association vice president Shahidul Islam also spoke. Khan put losses caused by arson at Tk 50 crore. "After talking with different quarters in the government I understand they fear garment workers and university students. That's why they don't want to take any action against them. "Taking advantage of the sentiment some terrorists posing as worker leaders are attacking one after another factory in a planned way." He warned the industry would face 'a big disaster' if the government did not provide security to the garment factories. The BGMEA president said, "We've decided in principle to increase salary and allowance of our workers. We are working on the matter. A final decision will be announced soon." He said the salary of the workers would be increased on the relentless rise of the prices of essentials but would not say how much the pay hike would be. Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association on Saturday announced a pay hike for the industry workers equating to 20 percent of the basic salary. bdnew
