 Chittagong, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com)  The first phase of automated taxation system was introduced at Chittagong Customs House Friday, with the online submission of export and import accounts by selected firms, officials said. If this first phase goes smoothly, the entire taxation system at the customs house will be fully automated from this month, they said. The project is being jointly implemented under the supervision of the National Board of Revenue and Chittagong Customs House, and financed by the Chittagong Chamber of Commerce and Industries. The inauguration of the project was marked with a launch ceremony, presided over by Chittagong Task Force commander Brig Gen Hasan Nasir. Duty commissioner (import) Md Shah Alam Khan, commissioner (export) Marghub Ahmed, chief coordinator of the automation activities and director of FBCCI and CCCI Md Amirul Haque and BGMEA vice president MA Salam were among those present. The first day of the project saw a good number of shipping agents, including Marks Line, APL and Peninsula Shipping Lines, submitting EGMs (Export General Manifests) and IGMs (Import General Manifests) online direct from their offices. Speakers at the launch ceremony said it was better that taxation was automated as it would ensure transparency, as well as save time for users of the customs house and port. They also suggested that the system should gradually be introduced in other customs houses of the country. bdnews
