<TEXT>
 KARACHI, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Controversial fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar, who has not played for Pakistan since December, has been named in a 15-man squad for next month's Champions Trophy. "Shoaib has been picked after doctors cleared his fitness," Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief operating officer Shafqat Naghmi said on Tuesday. Last month, the PCB left the paceman out of a Pakistan training camp over an unpaid fine after he had been chosen in a preliminary squad for the tournament. Shoaib had been asked to pay a fine of seven million Pakistan rupees ($94,910) by July 14 to be considered for selection. The fine was imposed by an appeals tribunal that cut from five years to 18 months a suspension he received for various acts of indiscipline. "We have decided not to link the payment of his fine with his selection," added Naghmi. "This issue can be resolved later." Shoaib has filed a High Court writ challenging the fine and ban. Fellow fast bowler Umar Gul and all-rounder Shahid Afridi were also included in the 15-man squad despite fitness fears. "Shoaib, Gul and Afridi carry a lot of experience and we are confident they will be 100 percent fit for the tournament," said chief selector Salahuddin Ahmed. COACH LAWSON According to media reports, the choice of Shoaib and Afridi led to a dispute between coach Geoff Lawson and the selectors on Monday because the Australian had doubts over their fitness. Afridi has not played since he injured his wrist in June. The selectors also picked young batsmen Bazid Khan and Khalid Latif and dropped all-rounder Fawad Alam. Wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal was recalled after being dropped for the recent Asia Cup. The Champions Trophy, to be played in Karachi and Lahore, starts on Sept. 12. Squad: Nasir Jamshed, Salman Butt, Younis Khan, Shoaib Malik (captain), Khalid Latif, Misbah-ul-Haq, Kamran Akmal, Shahid Afridi, Bazid Khan, Saeed Ajmal, Shoaib Akhtar, Umar Gul, Rao Iftikhar, Sohail Tanvir, Abdur Rau
