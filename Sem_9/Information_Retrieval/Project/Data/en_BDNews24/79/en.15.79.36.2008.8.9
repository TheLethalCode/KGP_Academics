 HERAT, Afghanistan, Aug 09 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan soldiers backed by international air support killed around 20 Taliban insurgents and wounded 14 more in western Farah province on Friday, the provincial police chief said on Saturday. Violence has surged in Afghanistan this year with around 2,500 people, including 1,000 civilians, killed so far this year in fighting between Taliban insurgents and foreign and Afghan forces, aid agencies say. "The Taliban were gathering for a meeting in an area of Bala Boluk district," the provincial police chief, Khalilullah Rahmani, told Reuters. "An air strike targeted the meeting and killed 20 of them," he said. Fourteen others were wounded. A spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition forces confirmed that attack helicopters had taken part in the incident after their soldiers came under attack. "Coalition forces received small arms and indirect fire from an unknown number of anti-Afghan forces, said the spokesman. There was no damage or injuries to coalition forces, he said. He did not confirm whether any Taliban insurgents were killed or wounded in the incident.
