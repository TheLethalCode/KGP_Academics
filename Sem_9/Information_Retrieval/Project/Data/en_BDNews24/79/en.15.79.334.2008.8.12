 Dhaka, Aug 12 (bdnews24.com) Former Awami League minister Engineer Mosharraf Hossain was released on bail Tuesday after a High Court order. "He was released from the Kasimpur jail at 10pm following a court order," jailer M Sagir Miah told bdnews24.com. Mosharraf, initially arrested on Feb 25 last year, was released on Aug 1 this year from Kasimpur jail in Gazipuronly to be rearrested at the 'jail gate' on charges of violating emergency powers rule. The High Court on Aug 10 granted bail to Mosharraf in the EPR breach case, after the AL leader filed a writ petition challenging the legality of filing the case against him under emergency powers rule after his previous release from jail. bdne
