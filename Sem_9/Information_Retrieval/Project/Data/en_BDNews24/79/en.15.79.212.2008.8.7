 NAIROBI, Thu Aug 7,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The world must solve crises in the Middle East and Somalia or they will spawn more of the extremism that led to bombings of US embassies in east Africa a decade ago, Kenya's prime minister warned on Thursday. Raila Odinga was speaking at a ceremony commemorating the 10th anniversary of explosions that tore through Washington's missions in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam and killed more than 200 people, mostly local Africans. The devastating attacks were blamed on al Qaeda -- the first time Osama bin Laden's group had burst onto the world stage. "The scale of this atrocity shocked our nation to the core," Odinga said after laying a wreath at the site of Nairobi blast. "We must leave no stone unturned in fighting the scourge of terrorism. But at the same time, unless we provide just solutions to political crises such as those in the Middle East, new extremists will continue to be created." Odinga called for the swift creation of an independent Palestinian state with secure borders for Israel, and he also urged the U.N. Security Council to end violence and suffering that has plagued Kenya's chaotic neighbor Somalia. "We must do not only because it is our humanitarian duty. A lawless Somalia threatens Kenya's security," he said. The United States says several al Qaeda operatives suspected of being behind the 1998 bombings have sought refuge in Somalia
