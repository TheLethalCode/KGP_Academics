<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Sunday granted bail to former Awami League minister Mosharraf Hossain in an EPR breach case. A HC bench of justices Khademul Islam Chowdhury and Mashuk Hossain Ahmed also stayed the proceedings of the case and also requested law enforcement agencies not to rearrest him on release or harass him without lawful reason. Mosharraf, initially arrested on Feb 25 last year, was released on Aug 1 this year from Kasimpur jail in Gazipuronly to be rearrested at the 'jail gate' on charges of violating emergency powers rule. Sunday's ruling came after the AL leader filed a writ petition challenging the legality of filing the case against him under emergency powers rule after his previous release from jail. The court also issued a rule nisi to the government demanding an explanation within four weeks why the filing and proceedings of the case under EPR should not be declared illegal. Mosharraf's lawyer Barrister Sheikh Hasan Arif told bdnews24.com that there was no obstacle to freedom for Mosharraf. The HC earlier granted bail to Engineer Mosharraf on July 28 in two separate graft casesfiled by the ACC in November last yearand stayed proceedings of the cases for two months. The Anticorruption Commission appealed against the bail orders, but to no avail. ACC assistant director Jahangir Alam filed a graft case against him on Nov 22 last year with Chittagong police. On Nov 25, the same ACC official filed another case against him with Ramna police for concealing information on property worth Tk 3.8 crore. bdnews
