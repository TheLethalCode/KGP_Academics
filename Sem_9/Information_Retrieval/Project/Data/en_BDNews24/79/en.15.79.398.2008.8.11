 Dhaka, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com)  Detained former prime minister Khaleda Zia has refused to register as a voter while behind bars, a senior prisons official said Monday. "The former prime minister said she would be a voter, but not sitting in jail," deputy inspector general of prisons major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told reporters in the afternoon after meeting Khaleda at the special jail set up on the Jatiya Sangsad complex. Siddiqui said the BNP chairperson had been informed of the law relating to voter registration and contesting the national polls. Another detained former prime-minister and Awami League president Sheikh Hasina signed up as a voter from special jail on March 10, registering her Dhanmondi address. Prison authorities along with election officials had been preparing to register Khaleda Zia as a voter earlier Monday, deputy inspector general of prisons Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told bdnews24.com. Election commissioner M Sakhawat Hussain had told reporters: "We hope that Khaleda will register as a voter today, the last day of voter registration and correction for Dhaka city corporation." He said the EC requested Khaleda through prisons authorities to register. "Now it is up to her whether she will register or not." Sakhawat ducked a question on whether Khaleda would be given a chance to be a voter later. Election commissioner Muhammed Sohul Hussain had previously stated that Khaleda Zia must register by Aug 11 as there would be no chance to register after that due to technical reasons. On Sunday, Khaleda had asked the Election Commission to let her know about the barriers to contest the national polls for those who did not become voters on time. According to the Representation of the People (amendment) Ordinance 2008, one cannot contest in elections unless he or she is registered as a voter. Dhaka divisional deputy election commissioner Biswas Lutfor Rahman told bdnews24.com Monday that his office had given voter forms to the prisons authorities for 30 VIP prisoners, including Khaleda's son tarique rahman, who have yet to register. bdnews24.c
