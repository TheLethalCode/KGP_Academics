<TITLE> Sadr to disarm if US withdraws on timetable </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BAGHDAD, Fri Aug 8, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr would dissolve his Mehdi Army militia if the United States starts withdrawing troops according to a set timetable, a spokesman said. Spokesman Salah al-Ubaidi was speaking before Friday prayers at which he said the anti-American cleric would announce a new cultural wing of his movement. A ceasefire imposed by Sadr on his militia a year ago has been a key factor in a drop in violence in Iraq to four-year lows. Sadr, whose political movement controls 10 percent of seats in parliament, has long demanded US troops leave Iraq. US President George W Bush has refused to set a firm timetable for withdrawing 144,000 American troops from Iraq, but spoke last month of a general "time horizon" for a pullout. "We feel there's a serious intention by the American forces for a withdrawal timetable at the very least," Ubaidi said. "It should not be considered an end to the Mehdi army, but it's a halfway step to dissolving the Mehdi Army. If the US began to implement a withdrawal timetable we shall complete the path to dissolution." The Mehdi Army would largely be turned into a cultural organization, but would still maintain armed cells, Ubaidi said. Baghdad and Washington are negotiating a new security pact that will provide a legal basis for US troops to operate in Iraq when a U.N. mandate expires at the end of the year. Iraqi government officials say an agreement is close. But the White House says it is too soon to say when it can withdraw the forces, which have been in Iraq since the 2003 invasion. The issue is politically sensitive in the United States, where Democratic presidential contender Barack Obama has pledged to withdraw all combat troops by mid-2010, while his Republican opponent John McCain refuses to set a date. Iraq has said its vision was for all foreign combat forces to leave by the end of 2010 if security conditions allowed, a schedule that would resemble Obama's plan. Sadr's Mehdi Army launched two uprisings against US forces in 2004. The cleric backed Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's rise to power in 2006 but split with him last year over the troop timetable issue. Maliki, a Shi'ite, has launched several largely successful crackdowns recently against militias including the Mehdi Army. Ubaidi said the "resistance" would not end until US troops left Iraq but the cleric was ready to take positive steps if Washington moved in the right direction. "If we find (this does not happen) and the US forces change their stance over the timetable, we can change direction also," he said. "This will not mean ending the ceasefire, it will depend on what's going on on the ground.
