<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com) - A 87-minute strike from Hedayet Ullah Robin helped Mohammedan Sporting Club edge past Sunrise Sporting Club in the Group D opener of the Citycell Federation Cup at Bangabandhu National Stadium Thursday. Capitalising on a right-side minus from Enamul Haq Sharif, Robin three minutes from time did not mistake to tap the ball home to give the black and white a winning start in the season's curtain-raiser tournament. Maruful Haq's men hardly broke Sunrise's back line marshalled by Mamun Mia, Mizanur Rahman, Azad and Sujan and disappointed some 2,000 spectators at the big bowl. However, Mohammedan without any foreign players comparatively enjoyed superior ball possession throughout the match over the senior division's runners-up team, but their moves were not so much attacking that could give them an early lead. Whenever the Motijheel-based outfit was able to split the opponent's defense, they found a man stand tall under the Sunrise post. It was goalkeeper Sunny, who disappointed the popular black and white outfit several times. It was not that Sunrise were at bay all time, they also launched some moves against their mighty opponents, and sometimes they dodged Mohammedan's defenders Jewel Rana, Rajanai Kanta Barman, Saikat and Nasir, but could not beat keeper Aminul Islam, country's number one goalkeeper. Mohammedan controlled the midfield, consisting of Arman Aziz, Sharif, Maruf and Faisal Mahmud quite well and produced a couple of scoring chances, but it was striker Mohammedan Ronny, who disappointed Mohammedan twice in the first half. Despite availing of a defense lapse, Ronny sent the ball narrowly wide in the ninth minute while he again floated the ball over the opponent post with only needing to cross keeper Sunny in a one-on-one situation in the 24th minute. After the breather, the legs of both sides seemed tired and the ball was mostly concentrated in the midfield. Mohammedan, however, mounted pressure in the last ten minutes and had the last laugh. Sunrise keeper Sunny having denied a couple of attempts foiled a well-judged shot from Saikat in the 82nd minute, but five minutes later he finally was beaten by Robin, who tapped a Sharif minus home to give Mohammedan a wild celebration. In the second match of the day, Arambagh KS recorded a 2-1 win over Rahmatganj MFS. Jerry struck twice for the winners in the 35th and 53rd minutes while Francis netted the lone goal for the losers in the 75th minute.
