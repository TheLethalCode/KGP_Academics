<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 11 (bdnews24.com)  BNP reformist leader Hafizuddin Ahmed, echoing fellow reformist Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, stated on Monday that the party made a mistake in not endorsing candidates for the Aug 4 city and municipal elections. "BNP has made a political error by not backing candidates in the local polls. It was not a right decision by the party," Hafizuddintold reporters at his Banani residence. "It was not right to allow Awami League, their rival, a walkover. As a result, the party lags behind at field level," said the retired major. On the reformist leaders of the party, Hafiz said: "We remain inactive as we do not want to split the party." On party unity, he said: "There is no alternative to unity if BNP wants to participate in the national elections. Most of the leaders and workers of the party want unity." "We believe that there will be no disunity if the leader is released." Hafiz differed, however, with BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain on the need to give a 72-hour deadline for Khaleda Zia's release. "The government is going to free the leader as advisers have already said her release process is at the final stage. There is no need to give any further deadline," he said. Asked whether BNP would participate in the upazila polls, Hafizuddin said: "This will be decided at the party forum." "BNP is a popular party which is always in favour of elections. People want democracy, they want elections. That is why BNP should participate in all the elections," he said. Hafiz returned home last week after traveling for treatment to Singapore. Former BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, known as a fellow party reformist, also said after the Aug 4 polls that the party had made the wrong decision by not nominating candidates. bdnews24
