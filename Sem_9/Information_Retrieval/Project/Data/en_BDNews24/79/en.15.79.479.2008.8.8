 Dhaka, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com)- Awami League has urged the government to back down from holding upazila polls, vowing to hold them after the national elections if the party comes to power. "Awami League is pledge-bound to the nation to hold upazila elections within one or two months if it goes to power; it is the caretaker government's responsibility to hold national elections," Awami League presidium member and former minister Abdur Razzak said Friday. There is no justification in this government going ahead with upazila elections, he said, speaking at a discussion organised by Sechchasevak League. AL presidium member Tofail Ahmed, aiming at the policy makers of the caretaker government, said: "You prove your neutrality, hold an acceptable election and transfer power." "Give up thought of holding upazila elections, withdraw the state of emergency and fulfil people's expectations by holding an acceptable national election." "Back off from the process of depoliticising politics by giving up upazila elections," he said. Tofail said that the victories of AL-backed candidates in the recent city corporation and municipality elections proved that Awami League is a party of the people. Razzak repeated that if the election is held amid the state of emergency, Awami League "would stick to its position". He claimed: "The government wants to hold upazila polls and defer national elections on any excuse." "But Awami League is committed to holding upazila elections if it assumes power. So why is the government so pressed about the upazila elections?" Friday's gathering marked the 78th birth anniversary of Fazilutannesa Mujib, wife of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Sechchasevak League vice president Abdul Hanna presided. bdnews
