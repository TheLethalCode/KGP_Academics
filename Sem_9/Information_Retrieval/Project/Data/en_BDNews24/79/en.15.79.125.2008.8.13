 Chittagong, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed said Wednesday his administration was initiating efforts to release Khaleda Zia 'as early as possible', amid swirling confusion over the fate of the former prime minister. "The procedure to release detained BNP chairperson through a normal process is going on. The government is considering the process as early as possible," Fakhruddin told reporters after a cabinet meeting, held at the Circuit House Auditorium in Chittagong. Asked about the withdrawal of the state of emergency prior to upazila polls, the interim government head said: "The recent local polls were held properly." "That experience will be taken into consideration to decide if the emergency can be similarly relaxed for the upazila polls." "The government will consider relaxing emergency if any recommendations come on the matter," he said. Fakhruddin ruled out allegations by different quarters that the government was drifting away from its anti-graft drive. "People may think so, but the accused people are being tried through the legal process," he said. Granting bail is the concern of the judiciary, Fakhruddin added. "The government is taking a tough line on corruption, but its main aim is holding a free and fair election." "The government wants an election with the participation of all political parties, and it is working with the big picture in mind," he added. bdnews24.
