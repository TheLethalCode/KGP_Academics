 BEIJING, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French cyclist Jeannie Longo is taking part in her seventh Olympics in Beijing aged 49, and does not rule out going for a record eighth in London. "London could be fun, and it's not far from home," said Longo, road Olympic champion in 1996 and twice a time-trial silver medallist, in 1988 and 1996. Longo, whose Olympic career started in Los Angeles in 1984, insisted she had always been sincere when bidding farewell to the Games every four years. "I'm not a liar, but every time, the urge comes back and I resume training and I feel fine," said Longo. "This season I told myself 'why not give it another try?' and the training went well." As a result, Longo added three more national titles to the 52 she had already won and earned another Olympic qualification. "I think I have a chance on this course if the race toughens early in the big stretch leading to the final circuit," she said of the Olympic course finishing at the foot of the Great Wall. "The climb is hard and goes up step-by-step, but the descent is too easy and will make it difficult to break away." In 24 years, Longo has had plenty of time to witness the evolution of the Olympics, and she said it was now a different world from the Los Angeles Games. "I think 1984 were the first modern Olympics as we know them, with an athletes village similar to those we have now, with the profusion we have now. Money has definitely poured in and changed everything," she said. Prone to allergies, she said she had not been affected by pollution when she trained on the course on Thursday. "I spend a lot of time in the Reunion Island which has a similar climate, very damp and hot, but with a little bit more sun. Mind you, I saw the sun briefly today at the top of the wall," said Longo, whose record also includes 13 world championship titles. In six previous Olympics, she has never taken part in the opening ceremony and her race schedule will not allow her to chance her habits. "Road cycling races usually take place early in the Olympic programme and it's nonsense spending three hours standings in a stadium on the eve of competition," she said
