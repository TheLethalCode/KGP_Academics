<TITLE> Islamic militants plotting attacks in Germany: BKA </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BERLIN, Sun Aug 10,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Islamic militants trained in Pakistan and Afghanistan are planning attacks in Germany, although there is no evidence of any imminent threat, the country's top police officer was quoted as saying on Sunday. Joerg Ziercke, head of the Federal Crime Office (BKA), told Der Tagesspiegel newspaper more than 50 militants had travelled from Germany to training camps in Pakistan and Afghanistan run by the Taliban, al Qaeda and the Islamic Jihad Union (IJU). "Unfortunately, I am unable to sound the all clear -- after all we have repeatedly eluded a catastrophe by a mere hair's breadth," the daily quoted him as saying in a preview of its Monday edition. "Considering the statements from al Qaeda and the IJU we are convinced it has been decided to mount attacks in Germany," he added. "However, there is currently no concrete evidence of imminent strikes." In contrast to European neighbours such as Spain or Britain, Germany has not suffered a major recent attack on its own soil. But Ziercke said German investigators had foiled seven plots, including attacks planned by three men arrested in the western Sauerland region last year who authorities believe were targeting US installations in Germany. "Altogether, there are currently 200 investigations linked to Islamic terrorism being conducted -- the danger has therefore in no way diminished," he told Tagesspiegel. A single-digit number of militants had returned to Germany from the training camps and were among around 100 suspects considered a threat, he added
