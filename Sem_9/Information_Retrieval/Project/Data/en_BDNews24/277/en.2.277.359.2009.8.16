 Dhaka, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com)The International Commission on Chittagong Hill Tracts has praised the government for withdrawing army camps as part of a peace process, and also expressed hope that the troops recall will not aggravate law and order in the region. "This is good decision of the government to withdraw army," Lord Eric Avebury, one of the three vice chairs of the commission, told journalists at the foreign ministry on Sunday after calling on foreign minister Dipu Moni. The International Commission on the CHT was formed in Copenhagen in the 1990s to create pressure on the then Bangladesh government to stop alleged human rights violation in the hill region. Avebury and members of his entourage this week visited the three hill tract districtsRangamati, Khagrachhari and Bandarbantroubled by violence and counter-violence between the tribal people and the Bengali settlers since the 1970s. "I have told the delegation about the government's commitment to implement the peace treaty. The commission expressed satisfaction over the government's policy on the Chittagong Hill Tracts," Dipu Moni said after the meeting. "He (Avebury) hoped that the peace agreement, signed by the Awami League government in its previous term, would be fully implemented during the tenure of this government." The minister said the government was dismantling army camps as per the peace treaty. "Would any government take any action that would cost country's sovereignty?" Dipu Moni questioned, replying to criticisms aired in recent days of the opposition on the pullout of troops. Avebury also said, "We hope that there would be no deterioration of law and order in the Chittagong Hill Tracts after troops withdrawal." His comment follows the abduction of two rubber garden employees in Bandarban district earlier Sunday. Since the government's announcement of the withdrawal of a complete brigade, out of five stationed in the region, at least five people have been abducted in the area. CHT Regional Council chairman Santu Larma has said opponents of the peace accord might be responsible for the spate of kidnappings in an attempt to destabilise the peace process in the hill districts. The main opposition BNP and its allies, meanwhile, have said army pullout would threaten the country's integrity. The Awami League signed the peace deal with the Parbattaya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samity headed by Santu Larma who at one time led a guerrilla war against the army. The peace deal was opposed by another faction of Chakma guerrillas, the UPDF, which continued with violence despite the peace deal.
