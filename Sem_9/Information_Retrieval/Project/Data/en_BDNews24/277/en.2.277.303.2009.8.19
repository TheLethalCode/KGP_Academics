 Dhaka, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court on Tuesday fined three officials of food manufacturer Nabisco for marketing biscuits and chocolate carrying the Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution (BSTI) mark without prior approval. Managing-director of Nabisco Biscuit and Bread Factory, Abdul Mannan Khan, deputy-chief production officer Md Abul Khayer and production and quality-control officer Moinul Islam were each fined TK 95,000. Failure to pay the fine would result in imprisonment for one-and-half years, the court said. BSTI inspector Kawsar Ahmed Khan filed the cases on Aug 11. Sakhawat Hossain, an employee of the chief metropolitan magistrates' court, said two separate Dhaka courts had dealt with 32 cases in less than a month following the government's recent anti-adulteration drive. Magistrate AM Zulfikar collected Tk 945,000 in penalties from 23 cases, while magistrate AEM Ismail Hossain collected TK 538,000 from nine cases. Several more cases have been lodged with the chief metropolitan magistrates' court against the production and marketing of food and drinks without BSTI approval under the 1985 BSTI Act. Products labelled without weights and prices are also being prosecuted under a separate ordnance. b
