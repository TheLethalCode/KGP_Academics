<TITLE> Faruque wants to resolve Indian transit </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 20 (bdnews24.com)Commerce minister Faruque Khan said on Thursday that the stalemate over Indian transit rights through Bangladesh can be resolved through bilateral talks, although he conceded that problems still existed around the contentious issue. "There are of course some problems inherent in transit issues, but that doesn't mean we can't allow our neighbours passage through our land," Faruque told reporters at a function to mark export of the first consignment of bricks from Bangladesh to India, to pass through the Akhaurha land port. "India already enjoys maritime transit with Bangladesh, and we can hold bilateral talks regarding rail transit. Why then, after developing our road communications, should we not be able to talk about road transit," said Faruque. He said the government desired to see Chittagong Port become a regional transport hub and there was no sense in barring anyone from access to such a resource. Faruque said improved trade relations with India required improved infrastructure, and resolution of non-tariff barrier issues. Jitendra Chowdhury, Tripura's commerce minister, said Tripura-Bangladesh relations would be bolstered by the new brick export initiative. Abdul Matlub Ahmad, a prime mover in the brick export initiative to India and president of India-Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industries, said a bank was required at the Akhaurha customs check-point to further facilitate cross-border trade. Ahmad said construction of a 16 kilometre road from the Akhaurha border post to the Comilla-Sylhet Highway was also essential. bdne
