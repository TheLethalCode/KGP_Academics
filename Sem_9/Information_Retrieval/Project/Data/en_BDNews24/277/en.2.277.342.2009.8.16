<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 16 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court has set former army chief Moeen U Ahmed a September 13 deadline for submission of a written rejoinder in a defamation case filed against him by BNP leader Iqbal Hassan Mahmud Tuku. Judge Saiful Islam of the third joint district judge's court set the date Sunday, after Moeen's lawyer Humayun Kabir Bhuiyan requested the court for three months' time to submit the written statement and rejoinder required in the case. The court allowed just under a month. The plaintiff's lawyers, Md Taherul Islam Touhid and Sanaullah Miah, have also petitioned the court again to impound Moeen's Baridhara DOHS house, before the verdict should be delivered in the case. BNP's former state minister for power Iqbal Hassan Mahmud Tuku filed the defamation suit against Moeen U Ahmed on July 12, claiming Tk 100 crore in damages, for allegedly defamatory statements made against him by the army chief in the presence of media. Moeen, at a gathering on March 28, 2007, had reportedly said in front of reporters that huge corruption in the power ministry under the past BNP government caused losses to the state of Tk 20,000 crore. Barrister Mahbubuddin Khokan filed the Tk 100 crore case on behalf of the former state minister for power alleging that the statement had damaged Tuku's reputation. The BNP leader had also asked the court to stop Moeen from selling his Baridhara house. General Moeen went on retirement on June 15 this year, and is currently abroad with family. He was appointed the army chief in 2005 during the BNP government. The immediate past caretaker government granted him a year's extension. bdnew
