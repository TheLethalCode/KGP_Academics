 YANGON Aug 15, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US senator Jim Webb met both Myanmar top military leader Than Shwe and opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Saturday but it was unclear what he discussed during his separate meetings with them. Webb met Than Shwe at the country's remote new capital of Naypyidaw on the second day of his visit and later talked with Suu Kyi for about 45 minutes at a guesthouse arranged by government officials in Yangon. A witness told Reuters the 64-year-old Nobel peace laureate was taken by car from her lakeside home, where she was put under another 18 months of house arrest this week, to a guesthouse to meet the senator. She was found guilty by a Myanmar court for violating a security law after an eccentric American swam across the lake and stayed in her home. Webb, chairman of a Senate subcommittee on East Asia and Pacific, is the first member of Congress to travel in an official capacity to Myanmar in more than a decade. He has been described as the first senior American official ever to meet Than Shwe. Webb's visit comes in the wake of world anger over the conviction of Suu Kyi, a symbol of the movement for democracy in Myanmar, and some Myanmar dissident groups expressed unhappiness about the timing of his visit. Webb may press for the release of John Yettaw, who swam uninvited to Suu Kyi's home in May. He was sentenced to seven years' hard labour in a parallel trial on Tuesday on three charges, including immigration offences and "swimming in a non-swimming area". SANCTIONS VS ENGAGEMENT It is unclear what Webb aims to achieve. The U.S. embassy in Myanmar has little knowledge of his plans and says all arrangements were made by his office in Washington. The Obama administration, which had earlier indicated it was reviewing its policy toward Myanmar, has denounced Suu Kyi's conviction. The United States has for years tried to use sanctions to persuade the generals to release political prisoners. Asian nations have argued it is better to engage the junta than to isolate a resource-rich country that lies geostrategically in Southeast Asia between India and China. Webb supports a pro-engagement policy with the junta. Webb's office said on Aug. 6 that he would travel to five countries in Southeast Asia on a two-week mission "to explore opportunities to advance US interests in Burma (Myanmar) and the region". Earlier on Saturday, the US senator also met three representatives of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party in Naypyidaw. He was due to end his three-day visit on Sunday. Webb is a former US Navy Secretary and a Vietnam War veteran who speaks Vietnam
