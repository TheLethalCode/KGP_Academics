 Dhaka, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary panel has rejected the judicial probe report on the campus violence that took place on Aug 20, 2007 on Dhaka University. Terming the report "inadequate and irrelevant", the parliamentary standing committee on education ministry decided to find out the perpetrators of the three-day violence sparked by some members of the armed forces. Rashed Khan Menon, chairman of the standing committee, told reporters on Thursday after its eighth meeting that the law ministry had given the parliamentary panel consent to go ahead with its investigation. The committee at its previous meeting decided to re-investigate the violence resulting in the arrests and torture of scores of students and teachers across the country by members of the armed forces. "The judicial probe report did not identify the persons responsible for the three-day (Aug 20-23) violence on Dhaka University. "Instead, it included some irrelevant issues like the University Act of 1973 and the justification of political involvement of the university teachers and students," Menon told reporters at parliament's media centre. He said 10-member standing committee would investigate the incident to let people know the fact. The military-backed caretaker government then tasked Justice Habibur Rahman Khan to probe the unrest at Dhaka University. The education ministry in line with the committee's demand produced the judicial probe report before the standing committee on Thursday. "We have not formed a sub-committee to investigate the incident. The standing committee itself will probe it," added the chairman. Menon said the ministry could not produce any documents on the campus violence other than the order on the amnesty for four Dhaka University teachers arrested after the unrest. "Even the home ministry could not provide us detailed papers on the cases filed against the students and teachers," he said. "Therefore, as part of the investigation the committee has decided to request the information ministry to provide the TV footages, photos and newspaper articles on the violence." He said the cases against the teachers were withdrawn, but many students were still going to the court to stand trial for the "staged game". "Ten cases regarding the violence are yet to be lifted. "We have recommended that the government withdraw the cases by an executive order," said Menon. On Aug 20, some army persons had altercation with some Dhaka University students at the university's play ground during a football game over a trifle matter. The army men then beat up the students. As the news spread, the students took to the streets and assaulted some senior army officers. The angry students burnt one army vehicle on the campus. Violence erupted across the country in protest. The armed forces arrested many university teachers in Dhaka and Rajshahi on charges of instigating the violence against the army. The emergency government imposed curfew across the country and troops assaulted hundreds of innocent people including students and journalists. In the face of strong movement, the government pardoned the teachers and students and withdrew army camps from the university campus.
