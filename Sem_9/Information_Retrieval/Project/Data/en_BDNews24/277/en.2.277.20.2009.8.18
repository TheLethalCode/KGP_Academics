 CORRECTION: Police say no explosives were recovered, as reported in previous story Khagrachhari, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com)  Army and police in a joint drive arrested five Indian citizens, reportedly confessing to be Assam tribal separatists, in Khagrachhari hill district, police said on Tuesday. The five were picked up Monday at Noimail in Dighinala upazila, local police told bdnews24.com. "They told us they belonged to the National Democratic Front of Bodoland," Dighinala Police Station sub-inspector Mohammad Rafique said. NDFB has been fighting in Assam for over two decades for an independent Bodoland. Police recovered 25 pamphlets, four mobile phone sets, three dozen pencil batteries, one walkie-talkie set, a handsaw and Indian currency from them, Rafique said. Rafique said a case was filed against the Indian detainees. The Hindustan Times, reporting the arrest of the suspected separatists on its website Tuesday, called it an "indication of the growing cooperation between the two neighbours in curbing militancy". Bangladesh police caught three Indian militants last month, who had been hiding in Bangladesh for decades, with alleged links to the Pakistan-based terrorist organisation Laskhar-e-Taiba. bdnews
