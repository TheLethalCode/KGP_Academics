 Dhaka, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com)The US has welcomed the withdrawal of the army camps from the Chittagong Hill Tracts as part of the region's peace process. "Army withdrawal is  an internal issue. "But we do think that 1997 agreement was very, very positive," US ambassador James F Moriarty told reporters after a meeting with foreign minister Dipu Moni at foreign ministry. "If that's the context  then further implementation of the (peace) agreement is probably positive," said Moriarty. "Again it is your people who would decide," said the US envoy. The ambassador also again urged the Bangladesh government to recognise the Republic of Kosovo which declared independence from Serbia in February last year. Moriarty has met with foreign ministry chiefs at least five times since last February, to press for Bangladesh's recognition of the Muslim majority Kosovo. Kosovo, a region of the former communist Yugoslavia, came into being with the active support of the US and its major allies in Europe. Russia, however, has threatened to block Kosovo's entry into the United Nations. Moriarty has previously been awarded by the US government for his contribution to the framing of Washington's Balkan policy.
