 TEHRAN, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran put more people on trial on Sunday for their involvement in the unrest that erupted after the country's disputed June presidential election, the semi-official Mehr news agency reported. The June 12 vote has plunged the Islamic state into its biggest internal crisis since the 1979 Islamic revolution and has exposed deepening divisions in its ruling elite. Iran has held two mass trials for more than 100 moderates for various charges including acting against national security, punishable by death under Iran's Islamic law. A French woman and two Iranians working for the British and French embassies in Tehran have also been tried. Mehr said no prominent moderate politicians were among those on trial today. "The trial session of the third group of those accused of being involved in post-election unrest started today," it said. Moderate defeated presidential candidates Mirhossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karoubi say the vote was rigged to secure the re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who was sworn in on August 5. The authorities deny the charge, saying it was the "healthiest" vote the country has had in the past three decades. Iranian media said on Saturday 25 people were going to be tried on Sunday. Rights groups say hundreds of people, including senior pro- reform politicians, journalists, activists and lawyers, have been detained in Iran since the election. Many of them are still in jail
