 Rangamati, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com)All temporary camps in the Chittagong Hill Tracts are to be dismantled serially, although the six main army cantonments will remain in place, deputy leader of the House Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury said on Wednesday. "The ins-and-outs of the peace agreement will be implemented immediately, and within the tenure of the current government," Sajeda, also the convener of the committee for implementation of the CHT peace accord, told reporters on Wednesday. Sajeda, after a meeting of the committee at the CHT Development Board hall in Rangamati, said she was hopeful that removal of the camps would not jeopardise security in the region. But, she stressed, any attempt from any quarter to destabilise the sensitive border area would be resisted by the local population. "The government is very keen to push ahead on the issue, and conspiracies will not hinder the peace process," she said. There are 21 temporary camps in Rangamatai, 14 in Khagrachhari and none in Bandarban. The government recently formed a three-member convening committee for implementation of the peace accord, which comprises CHT Regional Council chairman Santu Larma and Khagrachari MP Jyotindralal Tripura, in addition to the deputy leader of the House. "Being an optimist, I signed the peace accord and hopefully the government will implement it immediately," said Santu Larma. Also attending the meeting, state minister for CHT affairs, Diapankar Talukder, said the peace accord had been in the "deep freeze" for the last seven years. "But we pulled it out of the fridge. It therefore requires some time to become dynamic," said Talukder. He also said initiatives would be taken concerning amendment of the land commission act. The meeting was also attended by CHT Development Board chairman Bir Bahadur and Chittagong divisional commissioners. bdn
