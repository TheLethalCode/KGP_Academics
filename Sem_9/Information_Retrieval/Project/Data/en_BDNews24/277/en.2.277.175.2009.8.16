 TALOQAN, Afghanistan Aug 16, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Supporters of Afghanistan's main presidential candidates came out in their thousands on Sunday in a last burst of campaign excitement with days to go before the ballot. The few surveys that have been published show incumbent president Hamid Karzai in the lead, but not by enough to avoid a run-off against his surprisingly strong challenger, former Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah. By law, campaigning ends at midnight on Monday, three days before Thursday's vote. Karzai disappointed thousands of people in the southern city of Kandahar who were hoping he would make an appearance at a rally addressed by one of his half-brothers, Ahmad Wali Karzai, Kandahar's provincial council chief. Kandahar is Karzai's home town as well as the heartland of the Taliban, whose fighters have vowed to disrupt the poll with attacks. In his own regional power base in the north, former Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah, Karzai's main challenger, was mobbed by thousands of supporters who stormed a gate to surge into the compound where his helicopter touched down. He was hoisted onto a pickup truck and driven through the town of Taloqan, surrounded by crowds of adoring supporters including children wearing T-shirts imprinted with his face. "I told the crowd we have already won," Abdullah told Reuters after delivering a short, sharp speech that won ecstatic applause at a stadium that included a section set aside for women in burqas. "Karzai has said when he wins he will offer me bread and tea and a job in his government, " Abdullah said. "I said 'thanks for the offer, but it won't help' ... I have already won." TEST FOR WESTERN FORCES For the Western countries who now have more than 100,000 troops in Afghanistan, the result of the vote may be less important than ensuring it takes place at all. Taliban fighters, stronger than ever since they were driven from power eight years ago, have vowed to disrupt the poll. The United Nations says their threats and violence have already interfered with preparations and curbed campaigning, and may keep many Afghans from going to the polls on Thursday. In a sharp reminder of the violence, a suicide car bomber struck outside the headquarters of US and NATO troops on Saturday, killing seven Afghans and wounding scores. There are also fears that fraud could jeopardise the legitimacy of the vote, making violence worse. Abdullah played down concerns that his followers could respond with unrest if they feel they have been denied a victory. "In the unlikely event that Karzai wins, I will encourage sensibility ... but this is unlikely because I have already won," he told Reuters. The latest survey by the US-funded International Republican Institute, conducted in July and released last week, found Karzai leading with 44 percent of the vote to 26 percent for Abdullah. Ramazan Bashardost, a member of the Hazara ethnic minority and former planning minister who runs his campaign from a tent opposite parliament in Kabul, would place third with 10 perc
