 LONDON, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Carlo Ancelotti's Chelsea came from behind to win 3-1 at Sunderland on Tuesday and make it two wins from two in the Premier League. Second-half goals from Michael Ballack, Frank Lampard and Deco cancelled out Darren Bent's 18th-minute strike for Sunderland in a match dominated by the visitors. "We played very well from the first minute to the last minute," coach Ancelotti told Sky Sports. "It was not easy in the first half because Sunderland scored but we maintained control of the game and had a good mental attitude. "It was a fantastic match for us. I am happy because I am seeing the team improve very quickly," added the Italian who took charge in the close-season. Chelsea, who also fought back to win 2-1 against Hull City on Saturday, began another rally with a Ballack equaliser seven minutes after the break following a Lampard corner. The Londoners scored again after 61 minutes when George McCartney's foul on Didier Drogba allowed Lampard to convert a penalty and equal Jimmy Greaves's record as the club's fifth all-time scorer with 132 goals. A fine strike by Portugal midfielder Deco with 20 minutes remaining sealed the victory. Elsewhere, promoted Wolverhampton Wanderers held on at Wigan Athletic for their first victory of the season, winning 1-0 courtesy of a sixth-minute header from Andy Keogh. Wigan, who recorded a 2-0 triumph at Aston Villa on the opening day, pressed hard after the break with on-loan Chelsea winger Scott Sinclair wasting the best chance with a header.
