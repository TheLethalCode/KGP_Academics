 GALLE, Sri Lanka, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tillakaratne Dilshan scored a century as Sri Lanka set New Zealand an improbable 413-run target on the fourth day of the first Test on Friday. Beginning their run chase, makeshift opener Daniel Flynn -- standing in for Tim McIntosh, one of seven players to be hit by a stomach bug -- was dismissed for nought in a short evening session to leave the tourists on 30 for one at the close. Flynn was acrobatically caught by a diving Mahela Jayawardene at slip off seamer Nuwan Kulasekara. Martin Guptill survived to the close on 17 with Ross Taylor on eight not out.

Wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum and batsman Jesse Ryder were the mostly severely affected and were unable to take the field in the morning. Jacob Oram, Jeetan Patel, Flynn, McIntosh and Chris Martin were also affected, team manager Dave Currie said. Spinner Muttiah Muralitharan finished with four for 73 from 42 overs while seamer Thilan Thushara claimed four for 81 as the Sri Lankans took the last two wickets of New Zealand's first innings. Daniel Vettori was last man out, bowled by Thushara for 42. Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara allowed the tourists to use reserve wicketkeeper Reece Young in the second innings due to the illness suffered by Ryder, who was originally McCullum's ba
