 Dhaka, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com)A flood warning has been issued for residents living adjacent to the Teesta Barrage in Nilphamari, advising them to move to safer ground after flash flooding in upstream areas forced Indian authorities to open gates of Gazal Doba Barrage. "All 44 gates of the Teesta Barrage have also now been opened," Mainuddin Mandal, assistant executive engineer of the Water Development Board (WDB), told bdnews24.com on Thursday. An area covering at least eight unions in Nilphamari has already been submerged, included around 10,000 hectares of land recently sown with Aman rice. Another six unions of Hatibandha Sadar could be marooned, said Mandal. The flood warning was issued at 3pm as the Teesta River crossed the danger level at Dalia point, in Dimla Upazila, flowing 45 centimetres above the red mark. Following the alert, many people were seen moving to safer locations with their livestock and possessions, the local bdnews24.com correspondent reports. Other northern and eastern districts were also at risk from flooding as water in swollen upstream India rivers descends on Bangladesh, WDB said. The Teesta River is also flowing above the danger mark in Lalmonirhat, while the Kushaira River is above the danger point in Sylhet, leaving five upazilas in the division partially flooded. Around 8,000 people have been cut-off by the rising waters in four unions in Hatibandha upazila in Lalmonirhat, reports the local bdnews24.com correspondent. bdnews
