<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com)The High Court on Wednesday reversed an earlier order that had suspended partial pullout of the army from the Chittagong Hill Tracts in line with a peace accord, the attorney general said. The bench of justices Syed Refaat Ahmed and Moinul Islam Chowdhury overturned the order made on Aug 16. The court had stayed for two days the withdrawal of army camps on two petitions. The next hearing will take place on Thursday. After the orders, attorney general Mahbubey Alam told reporters that the court, however, hoped that the government would not give any executive order on the troops pullout until the issue of army camp withdrawal was settled. Barrister Abdur Razzaq, a lawyer for the petitioners against the army pullout, echoed Alam. On July 29, the government decided to partially withdraw army from the three hilly districts within Sept as part of its move to implement CHT Peace Accord that had been signed in 1997. The government wrapped up some temporary army camps from the troubled regions amid the protests from those rehabilitated in the region. On Aug 13, advocate Tajul Islam and Badiuzzaman Khan, a CHT habitant, separately petitioned the High Court to halt the pullout. "Two hundred army camps were withdrawn from Chittagong Hill Tracts during the rule of various past governments," the attorney general said. "Army personnel will stay in six cantonments in Chittagong Hill Tracts even after withdrawing 35 makeshift army camps. [So] They can go to anywhere to face any situation," he said. The court asked the petitioners why they had not petitioned the court against the army pullout in the past nine years. Replying to the court's query, barrister Moudud Ahmed, a lawyer for the petitioners, said, "These petitions would not have been made had the government not announced [the pullout] through a press release." Security situation worsened in CHT after the government had decided to partially withdraw the army from there, he told the court in the hearing. bd
