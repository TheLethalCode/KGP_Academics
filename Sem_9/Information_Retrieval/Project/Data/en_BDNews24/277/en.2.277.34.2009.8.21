<TEXT>
 Gazipur, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com)  Exams at Dhaka University of Engineering and Technology (DUET) in Gazipur were postponed Thursday after simmering tensions gave way to violence between Chhatra League and Shibir activists on campus the day before. Along with the postponement of the exams, the university was declared closed until September 29 because of Ramadan, Shab-e- Qadr, Eid and puja holidays. New exam dates will be announced later, said Dr Abu Naim Sheikh, DUET student welfare director. The second semester examinations of all departments were scheduled to begin from August 29 and there was also a pre-exam study break since last Thursday. The tensions between Bangladesh Chhatra League and Islami Chhatra Shibir had been sparked by the pasting of posters of a Shibir-supported coaching centre over posters commemorating National Mourning Day. The announcement of cancelled exams on Thursday led to further unrest on campus as protesting students ransacked buildings and staged demonstrations that spilled onto surrounding roads. bdnews24.c
