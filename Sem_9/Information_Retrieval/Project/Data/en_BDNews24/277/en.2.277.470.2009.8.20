<TITLE> Libya sees Swiss apology for arrest of Gaddafi son </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TRIPOLI, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Swiss government officials now in Tripoli are likely to apologize for the arrest last year of a son of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, a Libyan government source said on Thursday. "The negotiations are going well and we expect the Swiss president to issue an apology for the arrest of Hannibal Gaddafi," the source said. The row began when Hannibal Gaddafi and his pregnant wife Aline were arrested in a Geneva luxury hotel in July 2008 on charges of mistreating two domestic employees. Some 20 armed police forced open their luxury hotel suite after being alerted to repeated altercations. Libya cut back oil supplies to Switzerland and withdrew more than $5 billion in assets from Swiss banks in 2008 over the incident. A lawyer representing Libya and the Gaddafis said in April they were suing the Geneva authorities for more than 500,000 Swiss francs. Geneva's prosecutor had already dropped the case in September last year after the plaintiffs withdrew their formal complaint after reaching an undisclosed settlement with the Gaddafis. Switzerland's government said last month it wanted to hold a summit with Gaddafi to defuse the row and that President Hans-Rudolf Merz was prepared to meet the Libyan leader soon.
