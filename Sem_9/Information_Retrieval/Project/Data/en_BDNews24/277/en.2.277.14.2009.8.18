 Sherpur, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com)  Sherpur district was the latest to be hit by public transport woes on Tuesday with long-distant and local route buses forced off the road as bus operators and workers called an indefinite strike. Azizul Haque Chowdhury, general secretary of, Sherpur District Bus-Coach Owners Association, told bdnews24.com that a number of Mymensingh bus owners had been obstructing the buses leaving Sherpur "without any reason" for several days. "We have called the strike to protest and demand that authorities act against them," he said. Shawkat Hossain, general secretary of the local bus workers union, said goods vehicles would be exempt from the strike. "But if our demands are not met soon, their movement will be stopped too," he said. Southern districts have seen a rash of transport strikes too in recent weeks, causing mass disruptions to daily life, as private bus operators have protested against BRTC buses on certain routes. bdnews2
