<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court on Monday dropped all charges against 46 accused, including prime minister Sheikh Hasina, in a case involving political clashes in the city's Paltan's area in October 2006 that left at least six dead. Chief metropolitan magistrate Dilara Alo Chandana issued the order following a government petition. Sahara Khatun, now home minister, as well as other senior Awami League leaders were also among the accused in the case. On Oct 28, 2006, the final day of the past BNP- Jamaat government's tenure, six people were killed in a fierce clash between activists of the Awami League-led coalition and Jamaat-e-Islami, during several days of riots in the Paltan area. The violence marked one of the bloodiest periods of that yearjust a day before Khaleda Zia transferred power as prime minister to Iajuddin Ahmed's caretaker government. The following day, on Oct 29, Jamaat leaders filed a case in connection with the incident with Paltan Police Station. ATM Sirajul Haq, amir for the Motijheel unit of the Islamist party, accused senior members of the then opposition AL-led alliance of instigating the killings of at least five activists of Jamaat student front Islami Chhatra Shibir. On April 11 2007, police pressed charges against Awami League chief Hasina and others for "abetting" the killings of political rivals during the riots. Hasina was abroad at the time. She had left Dhaka for the US on March 15 on a personal visit. On April 19, she came to London by a British Airways flight, en route to Dhaka. On April 22, a Dhaka court issued an order to arrest Hasina in the case, though the government just three days before had slapped restrictions on Hasina's homecoming saying her return might create "further trouble". Hasina did return to Bangladesh that year, and was later arrested and detained in special jail, as was Kahleda, by the then Fakhruddin Ahmed-led caretaker government. On July 8 this year, six months after the new Awami League government took office, a law ministry circular said the case would be dropped in the public's interest. b
