<TEXT>
 LOS ANGELES, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Michael Jackson will be buried in a private ceremony for family and friends on August 29, which would have been the pop star's 51st birthday, representatives for the Jackson family said on Tuesday. The 10 a.m. PDT (1 p.m. EDT) burial will be held at Glendale Forest Lawn Memorial Park, in a suburb of Los Angeles, a family spokesman said in a statement. "The Jackson family once again wishes to express its gratitude to Michael's fans around the world for their support during these difficult times," the spokesman said. The "Thriller" singer died suddenly on June 25 after suffering cardiac arrest. But the reason why Jackson's heart stopped, if one is known, has not been made public. An autopsy report remains sealed while police complete their investigation into the role prescription drugs may have played in his death and the actions of his doctors. Dr. Conrad Murray, who was with Jackson when he died, said in a personal video posted on YouTube on Tuesday that he was "afraid to return phone calls" or use e-mail due to the controversy over Jackson's death. "I want to thank all of my patients and friends who have sent such kind e-mails, letters and messages to let me know of your support and prayers for me and my family," Murray said. "I have done all I could do," Murray added. "I told the truth, and I have faith the truth will prevail." Police have raided Murray's Las Vegas home and medical office, as well as his Houston office, but he has not been formally charged. Police have also searched the offices of other doctors who treated Jackson. A spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Police Department declined to comment about Murray on Tuesday or say when police might wrap up their investigation
