 Dhaka, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com)Awami League general-secretary Syed Ashraful Islam said on Tuesday that the caretaker government "experiment" had failed, and a national debate should decide whether or not to continue with the system. "The caretaker system was an experiment, and it failed," Syed Ashraf told members of the Jatiya Juba League, a pro-AL youth organisation, at a meeting to mark National Mourning Day at the Institution of Engineers. He said the time had come to rethink the interim government system, and all those involved in the electoral process should debate the issue. "Let the Election Commission consider the opinion of all the political parties on the matter," said Ashraf, the local government minister.. He criticised the caretaker governments of 1991, 2001 and 2006, although he conceded that the AL had called on a caretaker government to assume power at the end of the last BNP-led administration. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda recently said it was possible to hold free-and-fair elections under a political government, the AL leader said. "The time has come to consider it," he said. bdne
