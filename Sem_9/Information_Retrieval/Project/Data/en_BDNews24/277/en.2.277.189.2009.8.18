 Dhaka, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court will set a time frame on Wednesday for processing the president's reference seeking a directive on the BDR mutiny trial, the attorney general said on Tuesday. After meeting the chief justice on Tuesday, attorney general Mahbubey Alam said, "I received a letter from the Supreme Court registrar by order of the chief justice asking me to be present in the Supreme Court Appellate Division on Wednesday at 9:30am." "The court will determine the legal process of resolving the reference forwarded by the president as per Article 106 of the Constitution." "The court will decide which lawyers will act as the amici curiae (friends of the court) in this reference. The hearing date will also be fixed." The court will give the amici curae copies of the reference, hear their statements and then give its order." On whether all 11 judges of the Appellate Division will hear the reference, the attorney general said, "If all the judges are present in the Appellate Division at the time, they will all take part in the hearing, or a full bench comprising the majority of judges will hear it." Asked if he had discussed the reference in his meeting with the chief justice earlier, the attorney general said, "It was just a courtesy call, but we did talk about the reference. I'll say what I have to say about it in the court." Reference seeks opinion on Army Act for BDR trial The president sent a reference to the chief justice on Monday seeking a directive on whether the accused in the BDR mutiny case could be tried under military law, specifically the Army Act of 1952. "The reference asks to know if there is any bar to trying the BDR mutineers under the Army Act," SC registrar Md Shawkat Hossain told bdnews24.com on Monday. "It asks what the process would be and whether a notice would suffice according to Section 5 of the Army Act to try the mutineers under military law." An inter-ministerial meeting on the BDR trial decided last month that the president would seek the chief justice's opinion on the BDR trial process as opinions varied widely on whether the accused mutineers should be tried under military or civil law. Over seventy people were killed in the Feb 25-26 massacre, of whom 57 were army officers, the rest of the victims were BDR members and civilian bystanders. The national probe body on the BDR mutiny, in its report submitted to the government in May, recommended trying the mutineers under the Army Act for fast trial. There were also suggestions from some quarters to try the accused under a specially formed tribunal. But in face of concerns, aired by BDR families and rights groups, over whether a fair and open trial could be held under military law or special tribunal, the government formed an inter-ministerial committee to "look at all aspects" before deciding on the trial process. The government has said the trial of those responsible for the BDR massacre will be conducted according to the constitution and existing laws, either under the BDR Act, the Army Act or civilian laws. But law minister Shafique Ahmed has said "complexities remain on some issues". According to Section 106 of the Constitution, the president can seek an opinion from the Supreme Court on any matter of law or public importance. On July 4, 1995, the then president Abdur Rahman Biswas had sent a reference to the Supreme Court to seek its opinion on whether a parliamentarian absent from parliament for over 90 days stands liable to lose his seat. bdnews2
