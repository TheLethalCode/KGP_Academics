 Dhaka, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com)  National Mourning Day was observed, on an overcast and rainsoaked day on Saturday, with calls for immediate execution of the long-pending sentences of the killers of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family members on the night of Aug 15, 1975. Aug 15 was restored as National Mourning Day in 2008, after a six-year hiatus under the BNP-led government, but was marked in low-key fashion last year amid the state of emergency. This year the day was observed as a full-blown state occasion. With the national flag flying half-mast atop government, semi-government, non-government and private buildings, individuals and organisations throughout the country marked the day with tributes and programmes despite the driving rain. Sheikh Mujib's famous words echoed in many places as his historic speeches were aired by loudspeaker. Dhaka became a city of grey, black and white. Hundreds of black banners with writing in white ink, demanding that the pending sentences of Bangabandhu's convicted killers to be carried out, were seen around the capital under grey skies. President Zillur Rahman and prime minister Sheikh Hasina laid wreaths and offered prayers at Sheikh Mujib's portrait at the Bangabandhu Memorial Museum in the capital just before 7am, sheltering under a canopy as a heavy downpour marked the occasion. The chiefs of air, army and navy forces, ministers, top government officials and Awami League leaders were present, among others, at the sombre tribute. Crowds from all walks defied the downpour to join the gathering at the memorial. Many of those at Road 32 were also chanting slogans in the rain calling for the verdict in the Bangabandhu murder trial to be carried out without further delay. Sheikh Hasina along with other party leaders went on to Banani graveyard to pay respects at the graves of other of her slain family members. Awami League leaders also gathered at Bangabandhu's grave in Tungipara, Gopalganj. Hasina's scheduled visit to the gravesite, however, was cancelled due to the bad weather. President calls for unity in Aug 15 message President Zillur Rahman, in a mourning day message, called on the nation to work as one for the success of the government's Charter for Change, in which he said lay Sheikh Mujib's dreams for the nation. "Bangabandhu dreamt a dream of a 'Golden Bangladesh'," said Zillur. "Sheikh Mujib's daughter and successor, prime minister Sheikh Hasina, has declared a 'Vision-2021' for a prosperous Bangladesh to realise her father's dream." "I am asking everyone to work for the success of the vision," said Zillur. He wished peace for the departed souls of Sheikh Mujib and his family members who were killed on the day, 34 years ago. "Mujib was the pioneer and architect of independent Bangladesh and its sovereignty." "His political prudence, indomitable courage, eloquence and powerful leadership motivated the countrymen to join in the war of liberation. He proclaimed independence on March 26 in 1971 and the people dived into a nine-month bloody battle to achieve their long desired freedom," said the president. "August 15 1975 is a black-chapter in our history ... the nation incurred an irretrievable loss. The country is deeply shocked and full with grief for this shameful incident." A family slain Sheikh Mujib's killing aimed at destroying the secular democratic state of a newly independent Bangladesh, prime minister Sheikh Hasina said in her mourning day message. "Anti-liberation forces committed an evil act to destroy the tradition, culture, and progress of the Bangla nation through the killing," said the daughter of the slain leader. Hasina and her younger sister Rehana, both in Europe at the time, were the only members of the immediate family to survive the killings. Those killed on the night, alongside Sheikh Mujib, were his wife Begum Fazilatunnesa, sons Sheikh Kamal, Sheikh Jamal and Sheikh Russel, daughters-in-law Sultana Kamal Khuki and Parveen Jamal Rosy, Mujib's younger brother Sheikh Abu Naser, nephew Sheikh Fazlul Haque Moni, Moni's pregnant wife Begum Arju Moni, Mujib's brother-in-law Abdur Rab Serniabat, Serniabat's daughter, son, nephew and grandson, Mujib's security chief Col Jamaluddin Ahmed, three guests and four domestic workers. Still waiting None of the killers have been brought to justice. The convicts in the Bangabandhu murder case still have appeals pending in the Supreme Court, 34 years after the killings that shook the nation to the core and changed its political landscape. The subsequent administration of Khandker Mustaque Ahmed, installed after Sheikh Mujib's assassination, passed an ordinance in November 1975 indemnifying the killers and closing the door to a trial for many years. The Awami League government, coming to power in 1996, revoked the indemnity ordinance to clear the way for that trial. Sheikh Mujib's former personal assistant Muhitul Islam filed a case with Dhanmondi Police Station against 20 people on Oct 2, 1996. On Nov 8, 1998 Dhaka sessions judge Golam Rasul awarded the death sentence to 15 of the 20 accused. Five appealed against their sentences from behind bars, while six of the those convicted remain overseas. The appeals remained pending with the Appellate Division through the next BNP-led government for lack of judges. The Awami League government coming to power again in January this year appointed four new judges to the Appellate Division, again clearing the way for resolution of the case. The government last week reiterated its "firm resolve" to bring the six absconding convicts back to Bangladesh. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam had also said last week that documents were being placed with the Appellate Division for the long-pending appeal hearings. b
