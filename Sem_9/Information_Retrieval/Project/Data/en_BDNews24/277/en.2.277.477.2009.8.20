<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com)The High Court has rejected two writ petitions seeking ban on partial pullout of troops from Chittagong Hill Tracts, clearing way for resumption of the withdrawal. The bench of justices Syed Refaat Ahmed and Moinul Islam Chowdhury made the order on Thursday on the petitions that argued that the troops withdrawal will put under threat the lives of Bangali settlers in the hills region dominated by indigenous people. The court on Wednesday reversed an earlier order that had suspended for two days the withdrawal of army camps on two petitions. On Aug 13, advocate Tajul Islam and Badiuzzaman Khan, a CHT inhabitant, separately petitioned the High Court to halt the pullout fearing that the recent pullout would void the earlier petitions. The court set Oct 22 to hear two other petitions they had filed before the quashed appeals challenging the legality of the peace accord signed in 1997. Tajul Islam told bdnews24.com after the ruling: "The court rejected the petitions. It set Oct 22 for the hearing of the main petitions." On whether they would appeal, he said: "We are considering the matter. Steps will be taken later." Attorney general Mahbubey Alam told reporters after the verdict: "The process of peace accord imlementation had started much earlier. Many acts had been amended according to the agreement. "Two hundred army camps were also withdrawn earlier," he said. The writ petitions were filed to embarrass the government and make political gains, the attorney general asserted. The court rejected them, he said. The petitioners' counsel, barrister Abdur Razzak said: "We petitioned to safeguard independence, sovereignty and solidarity of the country. We have nothing to comment on the ruling." "The court has set Oct 22 to hear the main petitions. The matter will be resolved on that day," he said. CHT Regional Council counsel Dr Kamal Hossain said: "There is no barrier to the army withdrawal or rearrangement (now) since the petitions are rejected." The court in its ruling said the claim made in the petitions that the army pullout was done all of a sudden was not true. The pullout was part of the army deployment and withdrawal process over nine years, it added. It said the government had withdrawn 200 camps from the CHT at different phases. Some 63 camps were withdrawn in 2004 and 48 camps in 2007. The decision of withdrawing 35 camps has been made as a result of the process and even after that there will be 300 camps and six permanent army cantonments, the court said. The government formulated Rangamati Parbatya Zila Parishad Act (Rangamati, Bandarban and Khagrachharhi) and Parbatya Chattagram Regional Council Act in 1998, one year after the peace accord. The court issued a rule nisi on the government over the petitions filed by Badiuzzaman Khan in May 2000 and Tajul Islam in Aug 2007 challenging the legitimacy of the peace accord and its implementation. The court asked the government to submit its statement by Oct 20. The bench on Thursday said the petitions should be resolved and set Oct 22 for the hearing. The government announced a partial withdrawal of troops army from the three hilly districts last month as part of its move to implement the 1997 CHT Peace Accord. It has since wrapped up several temporary army camps from the region amid some protests from Bengali settlers in the indigenous region. The High Court on Aug 16 directed the government to temporarily suspend withdrawal of troops until Wednesday following their petitions. The order was lifted on Wednesday. The attorney general in the Wednesday's hearing said: "Two hundred army camps were withdrawn from Chittagong Hill Tracts during the rule of various past governments," "The army personnel will stay in six cantonments within Chittagong Hill Tracts even after dismantling of 35 makeshift army camps. They can be deployed anywhere at any point to face any situation," he said. The court asked the petitioners why they had not petitioned the court against earlier troop pullouts in the past nine years. Barrister Moudud Ahmed, a lawyer for the petitioners, said, "These petitions would not have been made had the government not announced [the pullout] through a press release." He said the security situation had also worsened in the CHT after the most recent decision. Some five people have been abducted by gangs demanding ransoms in three separate kidnapping incidents in Bandarban, one of the three CHT districts, since the withdrawal began. On the issue, CHT Regional Council chairman Jotirindra Bodhipriya Larma, popularly known as Santu Larma, has said the CHT--based group that opposes the peace deal may be responsible for the kidnappings. bdne
