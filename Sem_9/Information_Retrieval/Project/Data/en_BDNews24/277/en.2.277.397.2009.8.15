 Dhaka, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com)  National Mourning Day was being observed, as clouds gathered and rain poured down on the capital on Saturday, with calls to carry out the sentences of the convicted killers of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, slain along with family members in a coup on Aug 15, 1975. The national flag was flown half-mast as people, organisations and parties throughout the country marked the day with special tributes and programmes. President Zillur Rahman and prime minister Sheikh Hasina, daughter of Sheikh Mujib, laid wreaths and offered prayers at his portrait at the Bangabandhu Memorial Museum in the capital just before 7am, sheltered under a canopy as a heavy downpour marked the occasion. The chiefs of air, army and navy forces, ministers and top government officials were also paying their respects in a sombre and emotional tribute. Members of the public and organisations from all parts of the country defied the downpour to join the gathering at the memorial. Many of the crowd were heard chanting slogans in the rain calling for the verdict of the Bangabandhu murder trial to be carried out immediately. Awami League leaders were also gathered at the Bangabandhu's grave in Tungipara, Gopalganj. Sheikh Hasina along with other party leaders went on to Banani graveyard to pay respects at the graves of other of her slain family members. b
