 Dhaka, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com)The High Court on Wednesday lifted a temporary stay order on the government's partial pullout of army troops from the Chittagong Hill Tracts. The bench of justices Syed Refaat Ahmed and Moinul Islam Chowdhury on Aug 16 had stayed the withdrawal of army camps for two days until a hearing on two petitions challenging the government's withdrawal of troops in line with the 1997 CHT Peace Accord. It vacated the stay order on Wednesday, as the hearing began. After the hearing, attorney general Mahbubey Alam told reporters that the court had vacated the stay order, but hoped that the government would not give any executive order on the troops pullout until the hearing was settled. Barrister Abdur Razzak, a lawyer for the petitioners against the army pullout, also said, 'The court recalled and vacated its order of 16.8.2009 to stay the withdrawal of army camps from Khagrachari, Bandarban and Rangamati ... It also expressed the wish that there shall be no executive order passed until the court takes up the hearing of the matter tomorrow." The next hearing on the petitions will take place on Thursday. The government announced a partial withdrawal of troops army from the three hilly districts last month as part of its move to implement the 1997 CHT Peace Accord. The government has since wrapped up several temporary army camps from the region amid some protests from Bengali settlers in the indigenous region. On Aug 13, Advocate Tajul Islam and Badiuzzaman Khan, a CHT habitant, separately petitioned the High Court to halt the pullout. They referred to an earlier petition, filed in 2000 challenging the legality of the CHT Peace Accord, that was pending. They said the recent withdrawal of troops would void the earlier petition and requested a stay on the pullout. "Two hundred army camps were withdrawn from Chittagong Hill Tracts during the rule of various past governments," the attorney general said. "The army personnel will stay in six cantonments within Chittagong Hill Tracts even after dismantling of 35 makeshift army camps. They can be deployed anywhere at any point to face any situation," he said. Dr Kamal Hossain, lawyer for CHT Regional Council, told the hearing, "The sky will not fall if thirty five makeshift army camps are moved." "The government will ensure security for all the people in the region." Hossain also asked, "Would anyone file a petition if Dhaka Cantonment was shifted elsewhere in the country?" The court asked the petitioners why they had not petitioned the court against earlier troop pullouts in the past nine years. Replying to the court's query, barrister Moudud Ahmed, a lawyer for the petitioners, said, "These petitions would not have been made had the government not announced [the pullout] through a press release." He said the security situation had also worsened in the CHT after the most recent decision. Some five people have been abducted by gangs demanding ransoms in three separate kidnapping incidents in Bandarban, one of the three CHT districts, since the withdrawal began. On the issue, CHT Regional Council chairman Jotirindra Bodhipriya Larma, popularly known as Santu Larma, has said those who oppose the peace deal may be responsible for the kidnappings. bdnew
