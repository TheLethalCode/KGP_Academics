 Dhaka, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com)Health minister AFM Ruhal Haque has called upon people not to panic while stories of swine flu spreading are in the air. He suggested that people should go to the health centres across the country if they have any respiratory problems with fever. "People will have to use handkerchiefs while sneezing. One should refrain from spitting around here and there and must wash hands using soap and water after fits of coughs," the minister told a briefing on Thursday after an inter-ministerial meeting at the Secretariat. "The total number of swine flu cases in the country has reached 87. Of them, 32 have recovered already," Haque said. According to the latest figures provided by the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research on Tuesday, the number of confirmed H1N1 cases more than doubled to seventy-six since the last count of 37 on Aug 15. Haque said: "We have handled the situation well so far. The authorities have been directed to beef up preparations to deal with the situation for the future." The minister said he was afraid that the virus might spread further as it spread widely in the neighbouring Kolkata in India. He said sufficient stocks of flu drugs were in place. "We have a stock of 32 lakh capsules for the swine flu patients. It is also possible to manufacture the medicines in our country," Haque said. The health directorate director general Shah Monir Hossain, state minister for health Mojibur Rahman Fakir, IEDCR director Dr Mahmudur Rahman and other officials were present in the briefing. The health minister had said on Sunday that the regional rise in reported cases of the H1N1 virus was "alarming" for Bangladesh, although the country was prepared to deal with the situation. In India, over 2,200 people have tested positive for the H1N1 virus to date, with 28 reported fatalities, an Indian ministry of health and family welfare update said on Wednesday. Screening measures were recently beefed up at Bangladesh's 11 land ports in a bid to check entry of the flu virus. Symptoms of the virus include fever with high temperature and respiratory problems. Bangladesh authorities advise schools and offices to grant leave to anyone who displays symptoms of the flu. Health officials also advise people to refrain from spitting and to wash their hands regularly to curb the spread of the flu virus. bdnew
