<TITLE> Bangladeshis in E London have higher oral cancer risk: study </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 By Syed Nahas Pasha London, August 16 (bdnews24.com)Bangladeshis living in East London could be at higher risk of getting oral cancer because of chewing tobacco, recent UK research suggests. Chewing paan  a betel leaf wrapped around a mixture of areca nut and tobacco  is common within the Bangladeshi community in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, which has the largest concentration of Bangladeshis living in the UK. The link between chewing paan and head or neck cancers is clearly established in worldwide research. Over fifty percent of the global head and neck cancers occur in South and Southeast Asia alone, where chewing paan is most common. Experts at Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry believe the habit of chewing paan may also have led to an "alarming" rise in the number of cases of oral cancer in the East London community. Barts findings can be compared to the national picture where rising oral cancer rates were this week linked to increased alcohol consumption by the charity Cancer Research UK. Rates of oral cancers, such as cancers of the mouth, tongue and lip, have increased by around a quarter in the past decade in those above 40 among the general population. The UK sees around 5,000 people diagnosed with oral cancer each year and around 1,800 people die from the disease. While drinking alcohol is frowned upon among East London's Bangladeshi population, the habit of chewing paan  which is known to cause oral cancer  is widespread. Dr Anand Lalli, a clinical lecturer in oral surgery at Barts, spoke about the trend in East London following a screening programme of 1300 local residents for early signs of oral cancer. Using a mobile dental unit, the team from the Centre for Clinical and Diagnostic Oral Sciences, toured areas of East London, targeting the Bangladeshi community, especially those who rarely visited a dentist. Dr Lalli estimated that one in every fifteen people who was examined as part of the screening programme funded by Cancer Research UK, were referred to the hospital for further investigation. He explained: "Along with the rest of the UK, we are seeing an alarming rise in the number of people being diagnosed with oral cancer. "The rise is being linked to drinking alcohol because of the huge increase in alcohol usage in the UK in recent decades. "Rather than alcohol, we believe that within the Bangladeshi community, chewing paan with tobacco or areca nut is the key contributing factor. "We know that in parts of South Asia where paan usage is widespread, oral cancer is one of the commonest causes of death from all cancers." The most common signs of oral cancer are ulcers, sores, red or white patches in the mouth that last longer than three weeks and unexplained pain in the mouth or ear. Less common signs include a lump in the neck, a persistent sore throat or difficulty swallowing. Dr Lalli warned: "If oral cancer is caught early on then there is a very good chance of curing it. But it becomes far less easy to treat the longer it is left." According to Cancer Research UK, cancers caused by smoking often take up to 30 years to develop, so tobacco is less likely to be the main reason behind the increase in oral cancer in people in their 40s compared with older people. And since smoking rates have gone down and alcohol consumption has gone up, experts believe the increase in oral cancer rates could mainly be down to drinking. Other risk factors that could have helped to fuel the rise in this age group include a diet low in fruit and vegetables, and a sexually transmitted infection called the human papillomavirus (HPV). Oral cancer rates in the UK for men in their 40s have gone up by 28 per cent since the mid 1990s, and rates for women in their 40s have increased by 24 per cent in the same period. For both men and women of all ages, oral cancer rates have increased by more than 45 per cent since records began in 1975. Hazel Nunn, health information manager at Cancer Research UK, said: "These latest figures are really alarming. "Around three quarters of oral cancers are thought to be caused by smoking and drinking alcohol. "Tobacco is, by far, the main risk factor for oral cancer, so it's important that we keep encouraging people to give up and think about new ways to stop people taking it up in the first pla
