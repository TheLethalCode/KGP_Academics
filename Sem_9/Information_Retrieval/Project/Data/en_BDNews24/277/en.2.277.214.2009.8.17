 Dhaka, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com) - President Zillur Rahman sought the Supreme Court's opinion on Monday on the BDR mutiny trial process. The president sent a reference to the chief justice on Monday seeking directive on which law was advisable to try the accused of the BDR mutiny. The reference was sent by a special messenger to the Supreme Court's registrar's office at around 3pm through the ministry of law, Supreme Court registrar Mohammad Shawkat told reporters. "We received the reference copy just a little while before. We will send it to the chief justice today," said Hossain. An inter-ministerial meeting on the BDR trial decided last month that the president would seek the chief justice's opinion on the BDR trial process as opinions varied widely on whether the accused mutineers should be tried under military or civil law. Law minister Shafique Ahmed had said last week a reference would be forwarded by the president to the chief justice this week. Over seventy people were killed in the Feb 26-28 massacre, of whom 57 were army officers, the rest of the victims were BDR members and civilian bystanders. b
