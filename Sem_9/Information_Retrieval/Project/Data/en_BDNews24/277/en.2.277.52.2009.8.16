 Khagrachhari, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com)  Two more army camps were dismantled in Khagrachhari district on Sunday, before the High Court directed the government to temporarily suspend troops withdrawal until hearing of a petition on Aug 19. The temporary Bailachhari army camp with 35 army personnel, at Guimara, and Nalkata army camp with 40 troops, at Panchhari upazila in Khagrachhari were withdrawn, said officials. It took the number of army camps to be withdrawn from Khagrachhari district to eight, with five remaining. Local union nirbaho officer Mostafizur Rahman said the Bailachhari camp was established in 1986 to ensure the security of the ten villages of the area. Another UNO Abdul Kader said withdrawal of Nalkata camp would not aggravate the security of the area. The two UNOs took the charge of the respective camps. Police also remain deployed in the area for security purpose. Deputy commissioner Mohammad Abdullah told bdnews24.com, according to the government announcement the withdrawal of temporary army camps in Khagrachhari district, should have been completed by next Monday. "The law and order situation is normal now." However, some areas of the hill districts, particularly Rangamati, have seen protests by Bangalee settlers against the pullout of troops. The High Court directive came just hours later to suspend withdrawal of troops from Chittagong Hill Tracts until August 19 on two petitions filed last week, regarding security of Bangalee settlers in the area and challenging the legality of the CHT Peace accord. bdne
