 Bandarban, August 17 (bdnews24.com)  Teams of army, BDR and police stepped up rescue operations on Monday to locate two rubber plantation staff abducted the day before in the Baishari area of Naikkhangchhari in Bandarban. The abductees, Hefazetur Rahman, 28, supervisor of PHP Rubber Plantation and Nazer Mia, 24, staff of the adjacent Mohiuddin Rubber Plantation were kidnapped by armed men from the area at around 2am Sunday, officials said. Deputy commissioner Mizanur Rahman said police, local administration and Bangladesh Rifles held a meeting immediately on hearing the news of the abductions on Sunday. Rais Uddin, the manager of PHP plantation, said the terrorists had initially sent a message demanding Tk 50 lakh in ransom but on Monday they dropped their demand to Tk 5 lakh. The kidnappers were negotiating with the father of Hefazetur Rahman, said Rais. Eight teams of police and BDR were carrying out drives targeting the suspected spots of the kidnappers, said Obaidul Haque, Naikkhangchhari police chief. Officials of Bandarban's 69th infantry said several teams of the Alikadam army base were also taking part in the rescue operation. "The kidnappers may take positions in the mountains and jungles near the Myanmar border areas of Alikadam-Baishari," said Haque. The rescue operations were beefed up from Monday, said Nawab Aslam Habib, upazila nirbahi officer of Naikkhangchhari. "We think they are yet to cross the border to Myanmar," he said. The latest abduction brings the total to five people kidnapped in Bandarban district since the government declared troops withdrawal from the Chittagong Hill Tracts region at the end of last month. The previous three, abducted in two separate incidents, were released in exchange for ransom, locals said. Chittagong Hill Tract Regional Council chairman Santu Larma has said opponents of the CHT peace accord might be responsible for the latest spate of kidnappings in the area in an attempt to destabilise the peace process in the hill districts. bdn
