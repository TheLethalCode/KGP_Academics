 ISLAMABAD, Aug 19, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan has captured a senior aide to Baitullah Mehsud, the Pakistani Taliban chief believed to have been killed this month in a missile strike by a US drone, military officials said on Tuesday. Maulvi Omar was captured by a pro-government militia in the the Mohmand region on the Afghan border on Monday and handed over to government forces, one official said. The arrest came as the US special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke, was visiting Pakistan, and coincided with reports of in-fighting within the Pakistani Taliban since the report of Mehsud's death on Aug. 5. A senior intelligence official who declined to be identified and a Pakistani television station said Omar had confirmed to interrogators that Mehsud had been killed, though government and military spokesmen were not available to confirm this. Both the United States and Pakistan have said they believe Mehsud is dead, although there was no confirmation. Mehsud's men have been insisting he is alive. "During the preliminary investigation, he confirmed that Baitullah Mehsud was dead," the intelligence official said. Analysts said Omar, a former spokesman for Mehsud, was not a military commander and his capture would have no direct impact on the insurgency, but that he could provide information about Mehsud's network. Mohmand and two colleagues captured with him were flown to the northwestern city of Peshawar for interrogation, another intelligence official said earlier. Omar was chief spokesman for the Mehsud-led Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), or Taliban Movement of Pakistan, a loose alliance of 13 militant factions, until he was removed from the post several months ago. Mehsud was an al Qaeda cohort blamed for a wave of bombings across Pakistan, including the 2007 assassination of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto. SUICIDE BLAST The army has been battling Pakistani Taliban guerrillas loyal to Mehsud in different parts of the northwest for months. The security forces have pushed back militants in their former bastion of Swat, northwest of Islamabad, and stepped up attacks on Mehsud's men in South Waziristan on the Afghan border, leading to a relative lull in violence over recent weeks. But militants have carried out several attacks in the northwest in the past three days, underlining the scale of the challenge faced by Pakistan, a nuclear-armed US ally crucial to efforts to stabilise neighbouring Afghanistan. A suicide bomber blew himself up at a military checkpoint in the neighbouring North Waziristan region, killing three people, including two soldiers, security officials in the area said. Holbrooke told reporters travelling with him to Pakistan at the weekend that Mehsud was "gone" and it looked as if there was a struggle for succession among his commanders. A senior army commander, Lieutenant-General Nadeem Ahmed, told Holbrooke that Mehsud's death had had a "psychological impact" but added that the Taliban remained a potent force that could still "do something substantial". After briefing Holbrooke on operations, Ahmed told reporters Pakistan would need months to prepare for a ground offensive against the Taliban in their South Waziristan strongh
