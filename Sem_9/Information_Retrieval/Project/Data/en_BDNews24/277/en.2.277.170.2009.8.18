 KABUL, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide car bomber killed at least seven people in the Afghan capital on Tuesday and a Taliban rocket hit the presidential palace grounds as violence surged across the country just two days before a cliffhanger election. Security officials said at least 52 were wounded by the suicide bomber, who rammed his explosive-laden vehicle into the convoy on the notorious Jalalabad road, scene of frequent Taliban attacks and home to many Western aid and military compounds. A spokesman for the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan said foreign troops were among the dead and wounded, without elaborating. The U.N. mission in Kabul said two of its Afghan staff members were also among the dead. With incumbent Hamid Karzai fighting to win a fresh mandate without a second round run-off, Thursday's election is also a test of U.S. President Barack Obama's strategy of escalating the 8-year-old conflict in an effort to reverse recent Taliban gains. Polls show Karzai likely to win Thursday's vote, but suggest he may fall just short of the outright majority needed to avoid a second round in six weeks. Taliban militants, meanwhile, have vowed to disrupt the poll with violence. Thick black smoke poured from the scene of Tuesday's suicide bombing and police held back onlookers as the wounded were ferried away in ambulances and pickup trucks. "I saw wounded people and dead people everywhere," said a shopkeeper named Sawad. "I helped some people to ambulances, their clothes were covered in blood stains." In a statement, Karzai said such attacks would not deter Afghans, who would vote "despite the efforts of the enemies and will show their opposition to their barbaric acts." Several small rockets were fired at the capital overnight. A police source said one caused some damage inside the sprawling, fortified presidential palace compound and a second hit the capital's police headquarters. Neither caused any casualties. Scattered violence shook the rest of the country, much of it linked to the election. In Uruzgan province in the south, a suicide bomber on foot killed three Afghan soldiers and two civilians at a police checkpoint. Rockets also struck Jalalabad to the east, wounding ten civilians in a house. A provincial council candidate was shot dead in northern Jowzjan province, and in Badakhshan in the remote northeast three election workers transporting poll material were killed when their car hit a bomb. A school intended for use as a polling station was bombed in Ghazni province causing casualties, and two schools that would be used as polling stations were hit by rocket-propelled grenades in Logar province south of the capital. With civilian and military casualties reaching record levels in the past few months, two more U.S. service members were killed by a roadside bomb in the east, the U.S. military said. BULLISH ASSESSMENT Election campaigning officially ended at midnight after a final day of hectic rallies in support of Karzai and his main rival, former foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah. Despite the violence, Kai Eide, the U.N. special envoy for Afghanistan, said he expected the vote would be a success. "I'm not trying to hide that there have been irregularities, but my overall assessment is that this has been a success for the Afghan people," he told a news conference. Abdullah, an urbane eye doctor, has run an energetic campaign, seeking to garner support from beyond his base in the mainly ethnic Tajik north. Recent polls give Karzai about 45 percent of the vote to 25 percent for Abdullah. The president's reliance for support on ex-militia leaders such as Uzbek General Abdul Rashid Dostum has raised alarm among his international backers worried that warlords could return to power in the country they dominated for decades. Dostum, who won 10 percent of the vote in 2004, returned from exile in Turkey late on Sunday to back Karzai, staging a chaotic rally for the president in his northern redoubt of Shiberghan. The United States and the United Nations both expressed concern that Dostum could return to government. Washington said he may have been responsible for human rights violations. Taliban disruption could hurt Karzai's chance of a first-round win by lowering voter turnout in southern areas most affected by the insurgency, his ethnic Pashtun heartland. More than 30,000 extra U.S. troops have arrived in Afghanistan this year, raising the total number of Western troops above 100,000 for the first time, including 63,000 Americans. The Western troops will maintain outer perimeter security during the election, with Afghan soldiers and police guarding towns and polling stations. The NATO-led Western force said on Tuesday it would refrain from conducting offensive operations on election day, in line with an earlier pledge from Afghan troops.
