 Rangamati, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com)-Deputy leader of parliament Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury has said she believes the Chittagong Hill Tracts peace accord will be fully implemented immediately. "The peace agreement will be implemented immediately," Sajeda, also the convener of the committee for implementation of the CHT peace accord, told reporters on Wednesday after a committee meeting held at CHT Development Board hallroom in Rangamati. "We had a successful meeting," she said. The meeting was attended, among others, by Khagrachari MP Jyotindralal Tripura, state minister for CHT affairs Diapankar Talukder, secretary to CHT affairs ministry Mozammel Hawque Khan and CHT Development Board chairman Bir Bahadur. The Awami League government during its first tenure signed the peace accord with the Parbatya Chattagram Janasanghati Samiti in 1997. The main condition of the accord was the withdrawal of army from the hills regions. The incumbent AL administration began to partially withdraw one of the five brigades troops from the three hill districts of Rangamati, Bandarban and Khagrachharhi. The High Court on Sunday directed the government to temporarily suspend withdrawal of troops until Wednesday. bdn
