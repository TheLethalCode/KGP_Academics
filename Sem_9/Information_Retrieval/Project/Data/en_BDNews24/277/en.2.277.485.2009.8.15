<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh have reportedly made one change for Sunday's crucial fourth ODI of the Grameenphone Cup against Zimbabwe. The Tigers lead the five-match series 2-1. Mehrab Hossain Jr, who played in the third match which Bangladesh lost by 69 runs, makes way for opening batsman Junaed Siddique, according to TigerCricket.com on Saturday. The injury-struck Bangladesh side is still without the services of paceman Nazmul Hossain who is nursing a thigh strain. With Rubel Hossain already ruled out of the series due to a side strain, Bangladesh will again rely on their only fit pacers Syed Rasel and Mahbubul Alam for early breakthroughs in Sunday's game. Rubel's replacement Dollar Mahmud is expected in Bulawayo on the morning of the game. "We know that we did not execute our plan well and we let our standards drop. Everyone realises that we only have ourselves to blame for the defeat on Friday. We are really focused on putting up a much improved show tomorrow," said vice-captain Mushfiqur Rahim after the Bangladesh side had completed an intense training session at the Queens Sports Club on Saturday. "The wicket is absolutely flat and there is no margin for error. The game has to be won with high intensity cricket and if you lose concentration for a few overs while fielding then the match can quickly get away from you," added Rahim. Zimbabwe are yet to announce their playing eleven, but it won't be surprising if they stick to their winning combination. Their top scorer in the second game, Sean Williams, missed the third, so there's a case for his inclusion. He could replace Vusi Sibanda, who was out for a second-ball duck. The match begins at 2:30 pm (Bangladesh time) and TEN Sports and Bangladesh Television will provide live telecast. Teams: Bangladesh: Tamim Iqbal, Junaed Siddique, Mohammad Ashraful, Shakib Al Hasan (captain), Raqibul Hassan, Mushfiqur Rahim (wk), Mahmudullah Riyad, Naeem Islam, Mahbubul Alam, Enamul Haque Jr, Syed Rasel. Zimbabwe (probable): Vusi Sibanda/Sean Williams, Mark Vermeulen, Hamilton Masakadza, Brendan Taylor (wk), Charles Coventry, Elton Chigumbura, Stuart Matsikenyeri, Malcolm Waller, Prosper Utseya (capt), Ray Price, Tawanda Mupa
