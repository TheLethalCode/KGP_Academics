 Dhaka, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com) Bangladesh will start exporting bricks to India's north-eastern Tripura state from Thursday, a chamber chief said. The India-Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industries (IBCCI) and Tripura Chamber of Commerce and Industries have jointly taken this initiative. "We want to export 40 crore pieces of bricks worth Tk 280 crore in the next June-July," said Abdul Matlub Ahmad, IBCCI president and chairman of Nitol-Niloy Group. Commerce minister Faruk Khan will launch the first export at the Akhaura border in presence of Tripura commerce minister Jitendra Chowdhury and Indian high commissioner to Bangladesh Pinak Ranjan Chakrabarti. Ahmad expects to export products worth $ 10 million within 2011 which will reduce $ 30 million trade gap with India. Putting emphasis on infrastructural development he said cement, plastic products, stone gravels, fish, fruit juice, chanachur, glass sheet, chips, ceramic, dried fish and furniture are being exported to north-eastern India. In addition, there are potentials for exporting melamine and scrap metal from broken ships, he added. Asked about environmental damage the brick kiln and ship breaking industries cause, he said, "There are laws for preventing environmental pollution. We will not take bricks [made by polluting the environment]." A separate market named 'Bangabazar' will be put up at Agartala, the capital of the state, for selling Bangladeshi products, he said. b
