 Dhaka, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Rifles chief Major General Moinul Islam, addressing the first BDR durbar since the Feb 25-26 mutiny, told border guards justice would prevail if they were truthful about the events of those two days. "If you give true information, you will receive justice. Justice is not possible if facts are concealed," the BDR director general said at the first formal gathering in Durbar Hall on Monday since the force's annual durbar last February ended in the massacre of more than 55 army officers including Gen Moinul's predecessor, BDR chief Maj Gen Shakil Ahmed. . Gen Moinul said foreign foes benefitted from "the most heinous incident". "External enemies still exist. We must be aware of them," he said. Gen Moinul also said rumours were spread against the army during the mutiny. "It reminds us of the liberation war of 1971, the way anti liberation forces spread rumours against the freedom fighters." As many as 2,500 BDR members in Dhaka attended the durbar beginning just after 10am. Over seventy people were killed in the Feb 25-26 massacre, of whom 57 were army officers deouted to the border forces, the other victims were BDR members and civilian bystanders. b
