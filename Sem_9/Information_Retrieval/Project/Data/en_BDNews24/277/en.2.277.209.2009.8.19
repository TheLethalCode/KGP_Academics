 Dhaka, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary committee on Wednesday called for zero tolerance against extortionists irrespective of their political identities. The chairman of the standing committee on commerce observed, however, that rates of extortion, recently blamed by government ministers for spiralling commodity prices, had "not crossed previous levels". Speaking after a meeting of the committee, chairman Abdul Jalil said the government must not tolerate extortion "in any form". Jalil, a former commerce minister, said, "The committee recommends that the government must eliminate extortionists irrespective of their political identitiesno matter if they are Awami League or the BNP activists". "Extortion is a constant process. It has always been there. "But it has not crossed previous levels," Jalil said, replying to questions from reporters at the parliament's media centre. The chairman also brushed aside the opposition's allegation that "only the Awami League leaders, not businessmen" were recruited as dealers of the government's trade arm, TCB, to sell essentials at set prices during Ramadan. Jalil said that the newly recruited TCB dealers were all local businessmen. The government launched sale of Ramadan essentials through the TCB, under commerce ministry, earlier Wednesday, to counter any possible move of "business syndicates" to manipulate local markets. Local administration appointed dealers at each upazila. "The list was prepared by deputy commissioners," Jalil said. "The dealers may well have political identities. But they were not appointed on any political consideration. They are local businessmen," said Jalil, a former general secretary of the ruling Awami League. He said the government must ensure stability of prices of essentials not only during Ramadan, but all round the year. "It is very difficult to break the market syndicate. We cannot always implement what we want. "But we have been successful to a great extent to stabilise price of essentials." Commerce minister Faruque Khan told bdnews24.com that the committee had expressed its satisfaction over the measures adopted by his ministry to control unusual increase in the price of consumer products during Ramadan. He said the price of sugar rose recently due to higher sugar prices in the international market.
