<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com)The government has decided that current operator Saif Power Tech will handle operations at Chittagong Container Terminal even after the deal expires, the shipping minister said on Sunday. The deal with the company ended on Saturday, but it will continue its operations as the government failed to appoint a new operator "We have decided to continue the handling will be continued by Saif Power Tech," Shahjahan Khan told reporters at the Secretariat. The parliamentary standing committee on the shipping ministry has recommended against awarding work order to the lowest bidder, Esack Brothers, on allegations of irregularities in tender, he said. Esack Brothers is not being given the work order as investigations are being carried out on the contract awarded to them in January this year, said Khan. Former shipping adviser MA Matin has been implicated in the allegedly improper award of the contract to Esack Brothers. "We are considering awarding the work order to the second bidder," Khan said. Saif Power Tech will operate the terminal till next month, though the company is charging Tk 505 per container Khan said. Esack Brothers had offered to operate at a rate of Tk 340 percontainer. The port handles more than 2,000 containers daily. The minister last week told bdnews24.com that they might form a joint-body comprising berth operators and port authority officials to handle containers at the CCT in case of failure to appoint an operator. bdne
