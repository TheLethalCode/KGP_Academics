 GAZA , Aug 15,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Gaza Strip's Hamas rulers said on Saturday the leader of an Islamist pan-Arab group was among 22 people killed in clashes with police. A spokesman for the Hamas-run Interior Ministry said Abdel-Latif Moussa was killed in the clashes between supporters of his Jund Ansar Allah group ("Warriors of God") and Hamas policemen in the southern town of Rafah. Moussa staged a challenge to Hamas's nationalist brand of Palestinian Islam by declaring before Friday prayers an "Islamic emirate" in Gaza. About 15 gunmen, including a Syrian national, and six Hamas policemen were killed in the violence, the spokesman said. He said about 40 "outlaws" affiliated with the group were arrested in Rafah, near the Egyptian border. Moussa was know to followers by the al Qaeda-style nom de guerre Abu al-Nour al-Maqdessi. His group espoused a pan-Arab militancy aligned with al Qaeda, which uses the historical term "emirate" to mean clerical rule across the Islamic world. Hamas's comment that a Syrian gunmen had been killed in the clashes contradicted an earlier statement by Ismail Haniyeh, who heads Gaza's Hamas government, that no non-Palestinian fighters were in the territory, as alleged by Israel which says veterans of wars in Afghanistan and Iraq live in Gaza. Moussa's group announced its presence in Gaza two months ago after three of its members were killed in a border raid on an Israeli base in which gunmen rode on horseback. Outside the mosque on Friday, nearly 100 of the group's masked fighters in Pakistani-style dress, and with long hair in a style believed to imitate the Prophet Mohammad, carried automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenade launchers. Hamas's leaders say it is a moderate movement while independent analysts say it gives priority to Palestinian nationalist goals over the international religious aims that are typical of al Qaeda's network. Israel unilaterally ended its occupation of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and withdrew its forces. Islamist radicals began to surface in Gaza after the takeover of the Israeli-blockaded enclave by Hamas in 2007, when it routed the forces of the secular Fatah movement of Palestinian President Mahmoud Ab
