 Narail, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com)A second Tk 10 crore defamation suit has been filed against BNP MP Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury for his derogatory remarks about the assassination of independence hero 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Siddiq Ahmed, former general secretary of Narail district Awami League, filed the case at the Narail judicial magistrate's court on Wednesday. Magistrate Musrat Zerin recorded the deposition of the plaintiff, said assistant public prosecutor of the court Mohammed Alamgir Siddiqui. The case details said: "Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury spoke of the murder of Bangabandhu in 1975 being 'inevitable' at a programme at the National Press Club, which was published in different national dailies the following day." "The people of this country were deeply hurt and sustained losses because of the speech." "Though the losses cannot be measured by any monetary scales, it may well amount to Tk 10 crore," said the plaintiff. Sheikh Abdus Sabur, MA Salam Khan, Daulat Ahmed Khan and Abul Kalam Azad are witnesses in the case. An almost identical case was filed in Khulna earlier in the week. Additional government prosecutor Sultana Rahman Shilpi also filed a Tk 10 crore defamation suit against Chowdhury at a Khulna court on Monday. Shilpi said in her deposition that she had been "mentally wounded" by Chowdhury's comment, made on Aug 13, that the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and members of his family had been "inevitable". State minister for home Shamsul Haque Tuku also reacted against the comments saying a treason case could be filed against Chowdhury over the ''ignominious speech''. Sheikh Mujib, the first president of the country, was killed along with most of his family members in Aug 15, 1975 in a military putsch. Chowdhury, an MP from Chittagong, has a knack for sparking off debates and controversies often through making irresponsible comments. Chowdhury is also widely accused of having committed countless murders, arson, looting and rape during the war of independence from Pakistan in 1971 , alleged the plaintiff. Specific allegations against Chowdhury include the killing Nuton Chandra Singha, the owner of Kundeshwari Oushodhaloy, a herbal medicine manufacturer in Chittagong, and running a torture camp at his house on Good Hills during the war. The state minister for law said on several occasions through this week that he will be tried for war crimes. Chowdhury has denied the war crimes charges and said they were all cooked up charges because his father Fazlul Quader Chowdhury, a Muslim League leader, had sided with the Pakistani occupation troops during the war. bdnews
