 Dhaka, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com)Food minister Abdur Razzak on Sunday blamed endemic corruption in the transport sector for the perennial problem of price hikes in market essentials over Ramadan. "At least 70 percent of the money required to hire trucks is spend on countless demands for extortion during the transportation of goods, which the public ends up paying for," Razzak said at a signing ceremony of a deal between the Agora supermarket chain and an agricultural cooperative society at the Dhaka Sheraton Hotel. Razzak said it often cost businessmen as much as Tk 20,000 in illegal tolls and other bribes to take a truck full of goods from Jessore to Mymensingh. Razzak said he had informed the detective branch of his findings and the law enforcers would report back to him within four days, after which the concerned ministry would be instructed to take necessary measures to halt the practices. The food minister added that in his home district of Tangail it requires up to Tk 2,500 in illegal tolls to bring a truck full of goods to Dhaka. Agora and Hridoye Maati-O-Manush Shomobay Samity Limited, which comprises 1,000 farmers in Ishwardi and Pabna, signed a deal to work directly with each other bypassing all middlemen. Finance minister AMA Muhith, attending the event as chief guest, said if the nation could control extortion and crime it would become a peaceful and prosperous country within ten years. bd
