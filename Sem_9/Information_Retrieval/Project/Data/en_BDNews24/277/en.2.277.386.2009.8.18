 Dhaka, August 17 (bdnews24.com)The government and local authorities moved to fix wholesale and retail prices of essentials on Monday, for the upcoming month of Ramadan, while the commerce ministry formed four central committees to take immediate legal action against kitchen market traders found to be selling goods at elevated prices or otherwise cheating the public. The committees will take action against traders in the capital who do not display proper price lists or sell adulterated or below weight goods, the ministry said in a statement. Headed by the commerce ministry's four deputy-secretaries, the committees will contain representatives from government agencies, Dhaka City Corporation, the Dhaka deputy commissioner's office and law enforcers. The committees will report regularly to the commerce ministry on their monitoring activities. Outside the capital, taskforces led by deputy commissioners and Upazila Nirbahi Officers will monitor rural markets. Commerce minister Faruq Khan said on Sunday that a comprehensive price list of market essentials, to be displayed in retail kitchen markets throughout the country, would soon be published by the ministry with provision for no more than a five-to-ten percent profit margin for businessmen. "Import, wholesale and retail prices will be included in the list so shoppers can stay informed of the appropriate prices at all levels," Khan had said. The move follows recent rounds of talks between the minister and business leaders that aimed to hammer out a workable approach to the annual problem of kitchen market price hikes. Khan said the ministry's price lists would be effective over the Ramadan period, but permanent regulations on profit margins for businessmen were not being considered for the time being. TCB prices fixed The government fixed the prices of essentials on Monday to be sold by its trading arm, TCB, through dealers during Ramadan, the commerce ministry also announced. The prices were determined at a meeting chaired by commerce minister Faruque Khan with commerce secretary Firoz Ahmed, TCB chairman Md Joynul Abedin, representatives of concerned government agencies and chambers of commerce. Dealers will buy sugar from the TCB at Tk 37 and gram flour at Tk 47 per kg, palm oil at Tk 55 in Dhaka, palm oil at Tk 54 outside Dhaka, unbottled soybean oil at Tk 67 and bottled soybean oil at Tk 73 per litre. The dealers will sell to sugar to the public at Tk 40 and gram flour at Tk 50 per kg, palm oil at Tk 58, unbottled soybean oil at Tk 70 and bottled soybean oil at Tk 76 per litre. TCB will start selling to dealers from its warehouse on August 19. The Trading Corporation of Bangladesh earlier announced it was importing 25,000 tonnes of edible oil, 12,000 tonnes sugar, 200 tonnes of onion and 100 tonnes of pulses for Ramadan. Meanwhile, athe National Board of Revenue last week lifted import duty of Tk 4,000 per tonne on non-refined sugar, and reduced duty on refined sugar to Tk 3,000 from Tk 7,000 per tonne. The government has also decided to withdraw the current 25 percent import duty and 5 percent regulatory duty on dates, a Ramadan staple. City authorities move too In Chittagong, meanwhile, private wholesalers and retailers consented Monday to sell seven essentials at prices set by the city authorities. Deputy commissioner Mohammad Farid Uddin Ahmed announced the fixed prices of the commodities after a consensus was reached at a meeting with wholesalers and retailers at Chittagong City Corporation at midday. The meeting asked wholesalers to sell sugar for Tk 41, gram flour for Tk 41, motor dal for Tk 21, khesari dal for Tk 46 and onion for Tk 16 per kg, and soyabean for Tk 71 and palm oil for Tk 60 per litre. It asked retailers to sell sugar for Tk 44, gram for Tk 43, motor dal for Tk 23, khesari dal for Tk 48 and onion for Tk 17 a kg, and palm oil for Tk 62 and soyabean for Tk 73 a litre. The prices will be enforced for one week to begin, and then another set of prices will be agreed if needed, said Ahmed. Dhaka City Corporation and private market operators in the capital earlier in the month produced a similar price list of essentials for the capital, although discrepancies remain, according to shoppers, between the posted prices and those found on the ground. b
