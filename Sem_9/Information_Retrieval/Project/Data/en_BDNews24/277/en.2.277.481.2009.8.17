 Dhaka, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com)  The government will not retreat from implementing the Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord despite all difficulties, the state minister for CHT affairs said on Monday, a day after the High Court directed the government to temporarily halt withdrawal of troops from the region. "There might be major or minor hurdles in the implementation of the treaty. We will overcome them," the state minister, Dipankar Talukder, told reporters after a meeting with the International Commission on the Chittagong Hill Tracts at the Secretariat. The government is absolutely sincere about implementing the treaty, he told the commission in the meeting. CHT Regional Council chairman Santu Larma has said recently that indigenous communities in the hill region have not been able to keep faith in government pledges. Asked to comment on the remark, Talukder said: "People may say that." But the Awami League government since January has already taken major steps for the peace process, he said, mentioning that that two committees were working on itthe parliamentary standing committee on CHT affairs and the recently formed committee on the implementation of CHT peace accord. Talukder also referred to his government's reconstitution of the CHT Land Commission after seven years. Decisions on next steps will be taken in the meeting of the peace accord implementation committee slated for Aug 19, he said. On Sunday's High Court direction to suspend troops withdrawal from CHT for two days, the junior minister said: "The stay order is a court matter." "It does not have any bearing on the work of the parliamentary committee or the committee for peace treaty implementation." The High Court on Sunday directed the government to temporarily halt withdrawal of troops from the Chittagong Hill Tracts, until Aug 19, on two petitions filed last week. The directive came just hours after the International Commission on the CHT lauded the government's recent move to withdraw a complete brigade, out of five stationed in the region, the single largest pullout of troops since the CHT peace accord was signed in 1997. Lord Eric Avebury, vice chairman of the International Commission, met with foreign minister Dipu Moni on Sunday, hailing the ongoing army pullout from the region and expressing hope that the law and order would not deteriorate there. His comments came in the wake of protests by Bangali settlers in the region in recent days, who say the army pull out threatens their security. The Awami League government, during its last tenure, signed the peace accord with the CHT regional council in 1997 to put an end to decades-long insurgency in the region after indigenous communities lost lands and rights in the region during the 60s and 70s. The main conditions of the accord were phased withdrawal of army troops and restoration of land rights. The CHT International Commission was formed in Copenhagen in 1990s to put pressure on Bangladesh regarding alleged human rights abuses in the CHT region. Avebury, one of the three vice chairmen of the International Commission, visited the three hill districts last week and expressed satisfaction with the present government's policy. The five-member delegation met with the state minister on Monday. bd
