 Dhaka, August 14 (bdnews24.com)  President Zillur Rahman, in a message to mark National Mourning Day on Aug 15, called on the nation to work as one for the success of the government's Charter for Change, in which he said lay independence hero Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's dreams for a prosperous country. "Bangabandhu dreamt a dream of a 'Golden Bangladesh'," said Zillur. "Sheikh Mujib's daughter and successor, prime minister Sheikh Hasina, has declared a 'Vision-2021' for a prosperous Bangladesh to realise her father's dream." "I am asking everyone to work for the success of the vision," said Zillur. He wished peace for the departed souls of Sheikh Mujib and his family members who were slain on the night of Aug 15 in 1975. "Mujib was the pioneer and architect of independent Bangladesh and its sovereignty." "His political prudence, indomitable courage, eloquence and powerful leadership motivated the countrymen to join in the war of liberation. He proclaimed independence on March 26 in 1971 and the people dived into a nine-month bloody battle to achieve their long desired freedom," said the president. "He never ceased in his restless effort to represent an esteemed Bangali nation on the world stage." "August 15 in 1975 is a black-chapter in the history of the Bangali nation ... the nation incurred an irretrievable loss. The country is deeply shocked and full with grief for this shameful incident," said the president.
