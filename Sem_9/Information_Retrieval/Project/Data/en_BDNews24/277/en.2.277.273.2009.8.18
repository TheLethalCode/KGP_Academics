<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com)--The work on a feasibility study over establishment of a cluster industrial park in coordination with the small and medium industries will begin soon, a senior SME Foundation official said on Monday. "We will strike a deal with IFC on the issue by two weeks and then the work on conducting a feasibility test over the establishment of a cluster park will begin," acting managing director of SME Foundation Momtaz Uddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com after a meeting with representatives of the International Finance Corporation. The IFC, the World Bank's lending arm, and SME Foundation will jointly run the feasibility test and IFC will spend $ 0.5 million on the study. "We aim to bring plastics, light engineering, electronics and electrical industries under the roof of one industry as these industries resemble one another." "If the industries remain in the same place, they can provide us with products in less cost and get technical and infrastructural facilities." The three industries scatter across the country; for example, most light engineering industries have been set up at Dholaikhal in the old part of the capital. There has long been a demand to set up a cluster industrial park. The SME Foundation and IFC signed a memorandum of understanding on establishing a cluster park, but it is not clear how much assistance the IFC will provide and under what conditions. Ahmed said, "How much [the study] will cost will be known after running the feasibility test. In addition, it will be known only then how much funding will come from the IFC, government and other sources.
