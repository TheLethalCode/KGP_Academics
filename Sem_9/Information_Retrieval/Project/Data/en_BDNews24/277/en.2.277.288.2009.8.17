 Dhaka, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com) - President Zillur Rahman sought the Supreme Court's opinion on Monday to decide on whether the BDR mutiny trial should be held under civil or military law. The president sent a reference to the chief justice on Monday seeking a directive on whether the accused in the BDR mutiny case could be tried under military law, specifically the Army Act of 1952. The reference was sent by a special messenger to the Supreme Court's registrar's office at around 3pm through the ministry of law, Supreme Court registrar Mohammad Shawkat Hossain told reporters. He said it would be sent to the chief justice the same day. "The reference specifically asks to know if the BDR mutineers can be tried under the Army Act," Hossain told bdnews24.com. "It asks what the process would be and whether a notice would suffice according to Section 5 of the Army Act to try the mutineers under military law." An inter-ministerial meeting on the BDR trial decided last month that the president would seek the chief justice's opinion on the BDR trial process as opinions varied widely on whether the accused mutineers should be tried under military or civil law. Over seventy people were killed in the Feb 25-26 massacre, of whom 57 were army officers, the rest of the victims were BDR members and civilian bystanders. The national probe body on the BDR mutiny, in its report submitted to the government in May, recommended trying the mutineers under the Army Act for fast trial. There were also suggestions from some quarters to try the accused under a specially formed tribunal. But in face of concerns, aired by BDR families and rights groups, over whether a fair and open trial could be held under military law or special tribunal, the government formed an inter-ministerial committee to "look at all aspects" before deciding on the trial process. The government has said the trial of those responsible for the BDR massacre will be conducted according to the constitution and existing laws, either under the BDR Act, the Army Act or civilian laws. But law minister Shafique Ahmed has said "complexities remain on some issues". According to Section 106 of the Constitution, the president can seek an opinion from the Supreme Court on any matter of law or public importance. Truth will ensure justice: BDR chief Monday also saw the border force's first formal meeting in Durbar Hall, at Peelkhana, since the force's annual durbar in February ended in the massacre of more than 55 army officers including the then BDR chief Maj Gen Shakil Ahmed. Shakil's successor, Major General Moinul Islam, told the assembled border guards on Monday that justice would prevail if they were truthful about the events of those two fateful days. "If you give true information, you will receive justice." "Justice is not possible if facts are concealed," said the BDR director general. b
