<TITLE> Woods' bid for 15th major foiled by Yang, poor putting </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CHASKA, Minnesota, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Final round putting was the reason for Tiger Woods's first failure to win a major he led going into the last day, the world number one said on Sunday. "I made absolutely nothing. Terrible day on the greens and I had it at the wrong time," Woods said after his three-over-par 75 left him in second place on five-under-par at the US PGA Championship, three shots behind South Korean Yang Yong-eun. "I hit the ball so much better than my score indicates. I hit it great all day. "I was certainly in control of the tournament for most of the day, but just didn't make anything today. I hit the ball great off the tee, hit my irons well. I did everything I needed to do except for getting the ball in the hole." Woods, who began the round with a two-stroke lead, missed three birdie putts from 10 feet and another from 12 feet. He also missed a 12-foot, par-saving putt at the 17th that would have hauled him back into a tie for the lead. Still, Woods led or shared the lead until the 14th hole. Yang's spectacular chip-in for eagle at the short par-four 14th gave him a one-stroke lead over Woods, which boosted him to his maiden major -- and the first by an Asian man. The final margin of victory was deceiving as Yang led by one stroke going to the 18th, where he birdied to complete a two-under 70, while a demoralised Woods bogeyed. The result ended Woods's 14-for-14 record in cashing in final-round leads in the majors. Woods said his stunning defeat was a combination of his putting woes and Yang's solid play. "It's both. I was in control of the tournament most of the day. I was playing well, hitting the ball well. I was making nothing, but still either tied for the lead or ahead. "And Y.E. played great all day. I don't think he really missed a shot all day. He just made that mistake at 17 (three-putt bogey). Other than that, he hit it great all day. "It was a fun battle. Unfortunately, I just didn't make the putts when I needed to make them." The American, who took 33 putts for his highest total of the event, said the championship turned on holes 13 and 14. "At 13, I stuffed it in there," said Woods, who shared the lead with Yang at the time. "He made a mistake, hit it in the left bunker. He blasted out. I missed my (10-foot birdie) putt. He made his. "And then he chipped in on the next hole. "A lot of different things, a lot of different scenarios could have happened in those two holes. But I didn't execute. I didn't make the putt, and certainly he did." In the end, Woods believed he let his 15th major crown slip from his grasp. "I felt I played well enough to win today and the frustrating thing is I didn't make any putts," he said. "All the other 14 major championships I've won, I've putted well for the entire week and today was a day that didn't hap
