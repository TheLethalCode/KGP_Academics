<TITLE> Open nation's ports to transit: Muhith </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com)Finance minister AMA Muhith said on Monday that Bangladesh had potential to reap huge benefits from development of the country's transit facilities. "We have to cast aside narrow-minded concepts regarding transit issues in the era of globalisation," Muhith said at a meeting with the Chittagong mayor and councillors from the port city. "Anybody should also be allowed to use Chittagong and Mongla ports. In fact, all ports in every country should be open," he said. Muhith said Chittagong mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury's call to connect the port city with the Asian Highway was a "logical demand". He said the government would choose either Tamabil or Ashtogram in Sylhet division as an exit for the proposed highway from Bangladesh. "We wanted to go through Myanmar, but they do not want to be a part of it," said Muhith. He also said work on the planned deep-sea port would also go ahead, even if it could not be completed within the tenure of the current administration. bdnews24.com/r
