 NEW DELHI Aug 18,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said on Tuesday the country must invest in its own environmentally friendly technologies, the latest in myriad pledges from one of the world's biggest polluters to fight climate change. Singh's comments underlined how India was seeking to undercut demands by rich nations for it to do more to curb carbon emissions.

We must also make our own investments in new environment-friendly technologies," he told a national conference on environment and forests in New Delhi. India has already announced several steps to fight global warming, such as ramping up solar power investment, expanding forest cover and bringing in domestic energy efficiency trading. "In dealing with the challenge of climate change and environmental degradation we face the unfair burden of past mistakes not of our making," Singh said. "However, as we go forward in the march of development we have the opportunity not to repeat those mistakes." With about 500 million people, or about half the population lacking access to electricity and relying on dirty coal to expand the power grid, India's booming economy has huge potential to leap-frog to a low-carbon future.
