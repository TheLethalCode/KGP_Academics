 MIAMI, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Florida man pleaded guilty on Wednesday to threatening to kill President Barack Obama in an e-mail that said "the blood of Obama will run down the streets" of the US capital, a federal prosecutor said. Nathan Wine, 21, admitted to a judge in Tampa he sent the threatening e-mail to the US Army Recruiting Command on Nov. 5, 2008, the day after Obama won the US presidential election, US Attorney A. Brian Albritton said in a statement. Wine, who faces up to five years in prison, acknowledged he meant the e-mail as a death threat, according to court documents that did not reveal a motive. Wine said in the poorly spelled note he would "not mind going behind bars for being a trigger man on this tyrent." "I will not rest until this tyrant of america is gunned down," the note said. "The blood of Obama will run down the streets of D.C." No date was immediately announced for sentencing. Wine was indicted in the federal case in January after surrendering to police on a local warrant charging him with stealing a gun. Court records show he pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of petty theft in that case in April, was sentenced to time already served in a county jail and fined $638
