 Tangail, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com)A third defamation suit been filed against BNP MP Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury for his contentious remarks about the assassination of independence hero Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, this time claiming Tk 20 crore "in compensation". Assistant public prosecutor Abdur Rahim, also the senior vice-president of district Jubo-League, filed the case at Tangail's chief judicial magistrate's court on Wednesday. The magistrate ordered authorities to file an investigation report by September 10. A separate Tk 10 crore defamation suit was filed against Chowdhury earlier in the day in Narail by a local Awami League leader, Siddiq Ahmed. The case, filed at the Narail judicial magistrate's court, said: "Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury spoke of the murder of Bangabandhu in 1975 being 'inevitable' at a programme at the National Press Club, which was published in different national dailies the following day." "The people of this country were deeply hurt and sustained damages because of the speech." "Though the damages cannot be measured by any monetary scale, it may well amount to Tk 10 crore," said the plaintiff. An almost identical case was filed in Khulna earlier in the week. Additional public prosecutor Sultana Rahman Shilpi also filed a Tk 10 crore defamation suit against Chowdhury at a Khulna court on Monday. Shilpi said in her deposition that she had been "mentally wounded" by Chowdhury's comment, made on Aug 13, that the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and members of his family had been "inevitable". bdne
