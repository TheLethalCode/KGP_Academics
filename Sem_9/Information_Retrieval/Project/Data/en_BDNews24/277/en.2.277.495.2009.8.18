 Chittagong, August 18 (bdnews24.com)Sound economic governance, over and above revenue collection, is the current government's prime goal in fiscal policy, finance minister AMA Muhith said Tuesday in Chittagong. "Ensuring people's well-being should be our motto," the finance minister told customs officials in a views exchange at Chittagong Customs House. Muhith said the government should focus more on strengthening the economy through investment, industrialisation and administrative reforms rather than all-out effort only to enhance revenue collection. Customs commissioner (import) Syed Golam Kibria said the government is going to lose considerable revenue earnings, as import duties have been cut on a number of commodities. He said the government should in retrospect lower the revenue targets for customs houses. To boost future sources of revenue, Muhith stressed direct taxation, service fees and realising VAT in lieu of levying duties. Admitting that at least 25 percent of the total revenue to be earned remains unrealised due to litigations, the finance minister also said, "The government is working to clear the back-log of tax cases." "Talks have been held with the law minister and the attorney general and the concerned authorities are moving to set up a new special bench soon in the High Court to resolve cases involving objections against government customs and excise duties." He said, "It's not only the Customs House, people in general suffer propensities to sue one another." Muhith also said the government has taken steps to digitise administration systems with a view to curbing corruption. Questioned about raised duty on car imports, he said the explosion of car numbers over the past decade were a major cause of countrywide air pollution, especially in the larger urban areas. "Dhaka and Chittagong cities have been virtually flooded with imported cars. Reduced car imports will bring good to the country and its environment." Regarding cancellation of the pre-shipment inspection (PSI) system, Muhith said, "PSI was introduced 12 years back as an interim arrangement, but we haven't been able to devise any alternative to that in all these years." "This government hopes to put in place an effective alternative system towards the end of this year," he said. In answer to growing public frustration with recent inflation in prices of essentials, the minister said the government was adopting strict measures to curb extortion and profiteering, the main reason for rising prices. Customs Commissioner (export) Shahabuddin Nagri presided over Tuesday's meeting, following which the minister was given a two-hour tour of the Chittagong Customs House. The tour led to some complaints as all activities of Chittagong Customs were suspended during the time. bdnews
