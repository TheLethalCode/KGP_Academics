 Dhaka, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com)Police deny releasing a suspected drug dealer from custody, as he was being arrested in Mirpur Bihari camp on Saturday, due to threatening behaviour from his accomplices. Eyewitnesses said two alleged police informants were attacked during the incident, and were later admitted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital by the police for treatment. According to one of the alleged informants, a 32-year-old man calling himself Apan, law enforcers from Pallabi Police Station entered the Bihari camp in Mirpur Section-11 in the afternoon searching for a drug dealer. Apan said that he accompanied another local man with the police in a raid to catch the "known drug dealer Shahid". He said the police located their target and handcuff him, but soon after his arrest a large gang intervened and secured his release while he was still handcuffed. Apan said the assailants were all members of a local drug dealing gang. Officer-in-charge of Pallabi Police Station, Abduil Malek, said the suspect had escaped while the police were attempting to handcuff him and not after. "I have not heard of any suspect escaping police custody after being handcuffed," said Malek. He said two men had been admitted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital, but they had not provided the police with any information regarding a suspected drug dealer in the area. b
