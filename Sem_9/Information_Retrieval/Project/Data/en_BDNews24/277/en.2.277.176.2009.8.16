<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com)Health minister AFM Ruhul Haq said on Sunday the regional rise in reported cases of the H1N1 flu virus was 'alarming' for Bangladesh, although the country was prepared to deal with the situation. "We are prepared. Stocks of flu drugs are in place and doctors are receiving specialised training on a rolling basis throughout the country," Haq told reporters at his office in the secretariat. He said the disease was now being transmitted at higher rates within the country, but the public should not be alarmed as treatment facilities were in place in every district-level hospital in the country. Over 1,500 cases of the H1N1 virus, also known as 'swine flu', have been confirmed in India to date, with 25 reported fatalities. Globally, over 170,000 cases have been confirmed, with 1,462 fatalities recorded, an Indian ministry of health and family welfare update said on Sunday. The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) said some 37 cases of the virus have been confirmed in the country to date, with 31 of them making a full recovery and six remaining under surveillance. The health minister said recent measures to bolster screening measures in the country's 11 land ports would also assist in checking spread of the virus. "However, we can do nothing about people entering the country illegally and the authorities concerned with this should be aware of the matter," Huq said. Symptoms of the virus include fever with high temperature and respiratory problems. Bangladesh authorities advise schools and offices to grant leave to anyone who displays symptoms of the flu. Health officials also advise people to refrain from spitting and to wash their hands regularly to curb the spread of the flu virus. b
