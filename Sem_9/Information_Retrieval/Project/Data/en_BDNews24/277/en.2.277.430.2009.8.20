 Dhaka, Aug 20 9bdnews24.com)  The High Court dropped a petition challenging the barge-mounted power plant case against prime minister Sheikh Hasina from its cause list on Thursday. The bench of justices Sheikh Rezwan Ali and Md Raisuddin dropped the petition filed by Hasina to challenge the case. "The government has decided to withdraw this case. The legal jurisdiction of the bench has changed too. That is why the court decided to drop the petition against the case from its cause list," Hasina's lawyer Barrister Rafiq-ul-Haque told reporters after the ruling. The High Court on July 7 ordered two-month stays on the proceedings of two cases, including this one, on trial against Hasina. The court also asked the government and the Anticorruption Commission to explain within four weeks why the barge-mounted power plant and Niko graft cases against Hasina should not be scrapped in line with her petitions challenging their validity. Hasina petitioned the High Court on June 2, to cancel the barge-mounted power plant case. Since then the government has decided to cancel this and other cases against Hasina on grounds that they were pressed for 'political harrassment'. The ACC filed the case against Hasina and six others, on Sept 2, 2007, with the Tejgaon police station accusing them of taking Tk 3 crore in bribes in the name of Bangabandhu Memorial Trust in return for undue privileges for setting up three barge-mounted power plants. The government brought the case under emergency powers rules on Sept 20, 2007. The chargesheet in the case was submitted on Jan 11, 2008. The ACC filed the Niko graft case against Hasina and six others on Dec 9, 2007, involving the activities of Canadian firm Niko Resources Ltd. Hasina petitioned the High Court on June 19 to cancel case. bdnews
