 Bagerhat, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com)  Over 1,000 sacked Mongla Port workers withdrew a sit-in programme Wednesday evening, after three days of protest, on the condition that their demands would be met. The decision to withdraw the protest came from a "fruitful meeting" with the port chairman and the Mongla Port Stevedores Association who previously recruited the workers under the port's now-abolished call station booking system. "The meeting formed an 8-member committee, led by the port chairman, to meet our demands," Shamsul Ailam, president of Mongla Port Shipping Workers Association, told bdnews24.com. "The committee, after review, will meet our five-point demand by Eid-ul-Fitr," he said. The demands include re-introduction of the casual worker booking system through call stations, payment of nearly Tk 99 lakh in arrears still owed to the former workers by the Stevedores Association. Around 1,100 former dock workers, retrenched from Mongla Port due to new labour laws in 2008, began the "non-stop" sit-in protest last Monday to press their demands. Alam had said at the time the protesters would continue with the peaceful sit-in protest till their demands were met. The protesting ex-workers included 47 assistant supervisors, 138 paper workers, 52 cargo inspectors, 45 tally checkers, 49 deck foremen, 546 tally clerks and 239 hatch foremen. They were all formerly employed at the port through the Stevedores Association. As the Labour (Amendment) Ordinance 2008 was enforced on August 1, 2008, the Mongla Port Dock Workers Board of Directors and the Stevedores Association call station booking system were abolished, causing 1,016 workers to lose jobs. bdn
