 BRUSSELS, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Apple is investigating media reports that one or more of the company's iPhones have exploded in Europe, a European Commission spokeswoman said Tuesday. The spokeswoman for the EU executive, which oversees the safety of consumer products sold in the 27-country bloc, said Apple had described the reported incidents as isolated. Apple said it was aware of the media reports, which include a case in which a teenager in France said he was slightly injured when his iPhone made a hissing noise and shattered, but did not comment on any contacts with the commission. "Apple have come back to us ... and what they've said to us is that they consider these are isolated incidents. They don't consider that there's a general problem," commission spokeswoman Helen Kearns told a news briefing. "They're trying to get more information on the specific details of those incidents (reported in the media) and they will do tests as necessary to investigate the possible cause," she said. Apple did not comment on the commission spokeswoman's remarks. But a spokesman for Apple Europe Ltd. said: "We are aware of these (media) reports and we are waiting to receive the iPhones from the customers. Until we have the full details, we don't have anything further to add.
