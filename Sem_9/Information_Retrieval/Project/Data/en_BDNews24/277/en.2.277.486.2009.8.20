 Bandarban, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com)Land and water routes were blocked in the three districts of Chittagong Hill Tracts on Thursday as a group opposing the 1997 peace accord called for a daylong blockade protesting the troops pullout from the region. No transports except rickshaws moved in the districts and long-range buses did not leave the towns from 6am after Parbatya Bangali Chhatra Parishad called the blockade programme in Rangamati, Bandarban and Khagrachharhi districts. The Awami League government during its 1996-2001 term signed the peace accord with the Parbatya Chattagram Janasanghati Samiti in 1997. The main condition of the accord was the withdrawal of army from the hills regions. The incumbent AL administration began to partially withdraw one of the five brigades troops from the three hill districts. The High Court on Aug 16 directed the government to suspend the withdrawal of troops until Wednesday on two writ petitions filed by advocate Tajul Islam and Bodiuzzaman, a CHT habitant seeking ban on army withdrawal. The HC lifted the stay order on Wednesday. It also rejected on Thursday two writ petitions seeking ban on partial pullout of troops. Deputy leader of parliament Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, also convener of the committee for implementation of CHT peace accord said on Wednesday that the accord would be fully implemented during the incumbent government regime. bdnews
