 Cox's Bazar, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com)A newly formed unit of 'tourist police' are set to patrol the popular seaside resort of Cox's Bazar to provide additional security to holidaymakers alongside existing law enforcers. "The tourist police will work with the general police to ensure security of the many tourists who visit the beach at Cox's Bazar," inspector general of police Noor Mohammad told reporters after formally inaugurated the new unit of 82 policemen on Sunday. Noor said for the time being the tourist police would work under the Cox's Bazar superintendent of police, although a dedicated tourist police authority was likely to be formed at a later date. "We initially proposed a squad of 159 police personnel for the unit, but the government finally approved only 82 members," he said. The new squad will initially operate out of the existing police camp on the beach, although five acres of land have been acquired in the Himchhari area to establish a permanent headquarters for the unit, said Noor. bdnews24.c
