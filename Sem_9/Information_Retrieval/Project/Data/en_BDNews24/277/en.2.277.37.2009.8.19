 NEW DELHI, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The ruling Congress party said its ministers and members of parliament will take a 20 percent cut in salaries to express solidarity with poor people facing a severe drought in the country. Meagre monsoon rains have pushed India to the brink of drought, putting pressure on food prices and energy supplies and imperiling growth. "All Congress members of parliament, ministers and all those drawing salaries will accept 20 percent voluntary cut of salaries," Janardhan Dwivedi, a Congress spokesman said. "Above all, the way we conduct ourselves both in our private and public life must reflect concern for those who are suffering on account of the drought," said Dwivedi, after a meeting of the Congress Working Committee to review the drought situation. The party has also urged the government to keep prices of essential commodities in check with special emphasis on oil seeds and pulses. India's monsoon rains have been 29 percent below normal since the beginning of the June-September season, hurting crops such as rice and cane and triggering a sharp rise in food prices in India and sugar futures abroad. The monsoon is vital for India's summer-sown crops because most farmers do not have access to irrigation facilities.
