 KABUL, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Exiled Uzbek leader General Abdul Rashid Dostum, whose supporters could swing this week's presidential election, returned to Afghanistan on Sunday after being given a government all-clear. Dostum's supporters, who gave him 10 percent of the vote in the 2004 election, had threatened to withdraw their backing for President Hamid Karzai on Aug. 20 unless the former communist general was allowed to return. Surveys show Karzai in the lead but not by enough to avoid a run-off against his strongest challenger, former Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah. Campaigning ends at midnight on Monday, three days before Thursday's vote. Supporters of the main candidates came out in their thousands on Sunday in a last burst of campaign excitement. For Western countries who now have more than 100,000 troops in Afghanistan, the result of the vote may be less important than ensuring it takes place at all. Taliban fighters, stronger than ever since they were driven from power eight years ago, have said they will disrupt the poll. The vote is a test for US President Barack Obama, who has declared Afghanistan his administration's main foreign focus. More than 30,000 extra US troops have arrived in Afghanistan this year as part of an escalation strategy. The US reinforcements have launched the war's biggest offensives, alongside British troops who since last month have suffered their worst battlefield casualties in a generation. DOSTUM THE KINGMAKER Karzai must secure more than 50 percent of the vote or face a run-off against the next best of 35 challengers. A second round could see his opponents unite behind a single contender. Two US-government funded polls have him at around 45 percent. Dostum, a veteran politician renowned as a kingmaker, has been in Turkey since last year when the Afghan government released him from house arrest imposed for fighting with a rival. It was never made clear if Dostum's exile was ordered or self-imposed but on Sunday a government statement said there was no legal reason to prevent him returning. An aide for the former general said he arrived in Kabul on Sunday night. "Yes, he is back," Sayed Noorullah told Reuters. Dostum was a key part of the alliance that toppled the Taliban in 2001, but has been accused by human rights groups of widespread abuse, including allowing the massacre of several thousand prisoners during his watch. TALIBAN AT STRONGEST The Taliban, now at their strongest since then, rebuffed Sunday's government announcement to observe an "offensive ceasefire" on voting day and said anyone involved in the election put their lives at risk. "In order for them to not get hurt, we are saying to them to not go to the polling stations or close to the Afghan and foreign forces, for we will carry out suicide attacks or even direct attacks against them," a spokesman told Reuters by satellite phone from an undisclosed location. Afghan Defence Minister Abdul Rahim Wardak, at a news conference a day after a suicide attack outside the main NATO base in Kabul, acknowledged security forces faced enormous challenges on voting day. Preparations were boosted by news that the Afghan flag was hoisted for the first time in years over the formerly Taliban-held southern district of Nawzad after being re-taken by US Marines and Afghan forces. The district centre, in the mountains of Helmand, is all but destroyed after years of fighting -- first by British forces and more recently by US Marines -- against Taliban fighters. The Taliban now hold eight of the country's 356 districts. The operation in Nawzad follows last month's Operation Strike of the Sword, the biggest of the war, in which 4,000 US Marines swooped in a single night into three districts in the southern Helmand River valley. British troops launched a huge operation, Panther's Claw, in a separate part of the province, a couple of weeks earlier, but they have suffered Britain's heaviest ground combat casualties since the Falklands War in 1982. With a ban on campaigning coming into effect 48 hours before polls open, supporters of the main candidates came out in their thousands on Sunday. Karzai disappointed his supporters in his hometown Kandahar, who were hoping he would make an appearance at a rally addressed by one of his half-brothers, Ahmad Wali Karzai, the provincial council chief. Kandahar is also the heartland of the Taliban. In his own power base in the north, former Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah was mobbed by supporters who stormed a gate to surge into the compound where his helicopter touched down. There are also fears that fraud could jeopardise the legitimacy of the vote, making violence worse. Abdullah played down concerns that his followers could respond with unrest if they feel they have been denied a victory. "In the unlikely event that Karzai wins, I will encourage sensibility ... but this is unlikely because I have already won," he told Reuters
