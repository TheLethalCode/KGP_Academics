 Dhaka, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com)  Opposition chief whip Jainal Abdin Farrouque has "dismissed" a legal notice regarding the "confusing" birth date of BNP chief and leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia. "August 15 is Khaleda Zia's birth date," Farrouque said on Saturday at a gathering for Khaleda's 65th birthday. August 15 is also National Mourning Day, marking the night in 1975 when independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was slain, along with almost all his immediate family, in a coup. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina and sister Sheikh RehanaSheikh Mujib's daughterswere the only members of the immediate family to survive the killings being in Europe at the time. Shahjada Mohiuddin, a former leader of the pro-ruling party Bangladesh Chhatra League, served a legal notice on BNP chief Khaleda Zia on Friday to clarify her date of birth for the national record. Farroque, at Khaleda's birthday gathering on Saturday, said in reaction, "Those who think that the day is only for one man have served a legal notice by dint of their overweening power and majority in parliament." "We are dismissing the notice," he said. Mohiuddin's notice said Khaleda's date of birth according to her matriculation certificate is September 5, 1946. But, said the notice, after Khaleda became prime minister in 1991, the government issued a bio through the Press Information Department saying she was born on August 19, 1946. According to the most recent voter list, compiled last year, her date of birth was again changed and given as August 15, 1946, the notice said. The petitioner termed her birth date "confusing". The notice also asked her to refrain from observing August 15 as her birthday. Farroque said: "The government is doing whatever it wishes by the power of its majority." "They made a law for their own lifelong security," he said. "Now, they think nobody can have a birthday on August 15; that no one was born on this day. Such autocracy is not acceptable." Farouque wished the BNP chief long life. JSS, a cultural organisation of BNP, organised the gathering. Leaders of BNP and its associated organisations were visiting the party chairperson at her Gulshan office throughout Saturday to wish her happy birthday, said BNP deputy publicity secretary Mohiuddin Khan Mohan. b
