 WASHINGTON, Aug 14, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US consumer prices were flat in July versus June, but fell over the past 12 months by the most since 1950, according to government data that suggested benign inflation pressure even amid signs the recession may be winding down. The Labor Department said on Friday its Consumer Price Index was unchanged after rising 0.7 percent in June, in line with market forecasts for a flat reading.

That was also in line with market expectations for a 0.1 percent gain. Compared to July last year, the core inflation rate rose 1.5 percent, the slowest advance since February 2004, after increasing 1.7 percent in J
