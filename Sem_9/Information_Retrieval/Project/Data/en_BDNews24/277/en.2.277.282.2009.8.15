 MUMBAI, Aug 15, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Panic over the H1N1 flu pandemic in India has claimed an unlikely victim -- Bollywood. Cinemas and multiplexes were closed in Mumbai, India's film industry hub, after the Maharashtra government announced a three-day shutdown this week to combat the rising number of flu cases. "First it is the recession and then the strike and now this," the owner of a cinema said, echoing industry sentiments in a year that saw box-office revenues hit by a film producers' strike and the global slowdown. "This is definitely not a good year for the multiplexes." Despite the setback in Maharashtra, production houses UTV Motion Pictures and Studio 18 have decided to go ahead with film releases on schedule in the rest of India.

"Of course, the film will be affected initially, there is no denying that, but we are confident that we will recover well enough," UTV's chief executive Siddharth Roy Kapur said. "We have a window of opportunity to make up," Kapur said, adding that no big ticket movie releases were planned in the coming weeks. Studio 18 also went ahead with the release of "Life Partner" -- starring Fardeen Khan and Genelia D'Souza -- but experts warned that further delay in the Mumbai-Pune circuit could affect revenues. Trade analyst Amod Mehra said multiplexes could lose up to 50 million rupees per day.

Filmmakers were also worried their films would be hit by piracy. The cast of "Kaminey", including Shahid Kapur and Priyanka Chopra, shot an anti-piracy film on Thursday, urging cinema lovers in Mumbai to wait for the movie and not buy pirated CDs. "A day to go for kaminey! But not for Mumbai n Pune unfortunately," Chopra wrote on her Twitter feed on Thursday. "I'm hopeful u guys will wait to come to theatres and not watch pirated print," the actress said. The swine flu crisis has also affected filming of movies under production. The shoot for filmmaker Karan Johar's production "Kurbaan", which was to take place in Pune this week, was cancel
