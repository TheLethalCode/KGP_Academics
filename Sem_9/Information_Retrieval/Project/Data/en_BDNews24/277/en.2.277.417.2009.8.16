 Dhaka, August 16 (bdnews24.com)Commerce minister Faruq Khan said on Sunday that a comprehensive price list of market essentials, to be displayed in retail kitchen markets throughout the country, will soon be published by the ministry with provision for no more than a five-to-ten percent profit margin for businessmen. "Import, wholesale and retail prices will be included in the list so shoppers can stay informed of the appropriate prices at all levels," Khan told reporters at the Dhaka Reporters Unity building in the city. The move follows a recent round of talks between the minister and business leaders that aimed to hammer out a workable approach to the annual problem of kitchen market price hikes. Earlier, Dhaka City Corporation and market operators in the capital produced their own price lists of the essentials, although discrepancies remained between the posted prices and those found on the ground. Khan said the ministry price lists would be effective over the Ramadan period, but permanent regulations on profit margins for businessmen were not being considered for the time being. "We have talked with members of the business community, and they asked for a five-to-ten percent profit margin on their goods," said Khan. He said the ministry list would not be a problem for the business community, and it had been designed solely to put an end to profiteering. Retailers and wholesalers have consistently blamed one another for price hikes during Ramadan, with efforts in previous years to control prices largely falling flat. In the lead up to Ramadan this year, prices have again shown signs of instability with sugar, edible oil, lentils, potatoes and onions all registering elevated retail prices. "The government has been successful in stabilising prices prior to Ramadan, but the cost of some commodities has risen due to differences between supply and demand," said Khan. "There is no logic behind these price rises," he said, adding that certain big businessmen had been cashing in again this year. Meanwhile, a statement from the National Board of Revenue issued on Friday said the current import duty of Tk 4,000 per tonne on non-refined sugar had been withdrawn, and import duty on refined sugar has been set Tk 3,000 rather than Tk 7,000 per tonne. The government has also decided to withdraw the current 25 percent import duty and 5 percent regulatory duty on dates. The Trading Corporation of Bangladesh has started importing 25,000 tonnes of edible oil, 12,000 tonnes sugar, 200 tonnes of onion and 100 tonnes of pulses to check the price hikes. The goods are yet to arrive in the country. b
