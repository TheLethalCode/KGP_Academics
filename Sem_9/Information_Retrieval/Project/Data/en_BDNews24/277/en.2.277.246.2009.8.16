 Dhaka, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com)Warid Telecom, the country's fourth mobile service provider with 2.58 million subscribers, has launched its new pre-paid package which includes three options along with a basic product, officials at a press conference in the city said Sunday. Chief Executive Officer of Warid, Muneer Farooqui, formally launched the package at the Sheraton Hotel and said, "We believe in innovative, customer-centric and reasonably priced solutions that would create a niche for Warid and engrave its brand image into the hearts and minds of the people." The new package provides minimum call rate at Tk 0.29 per minute for Friends and Family numbers, off-peak rates of Tk 0.49 per minute for other numbers, peak rate Tk 0.59 per minute for Warid numbers and Tk 1.19 per minute for other operators. Local SMS will be charged a minimum of Tk 0.29, while the maximum charge will be Tk 2.49 for international SMS. Existing and new customers can easily switch to any of the new package's three options by SMS anytime, but they may not make more than one switch a day, said Abraham Kaikobad, senior manager, marketing, products and services,. Being asked about their expected deadline for issuing IPOs, chief commercial officer Marius M Voinea told bdnews24.com, "We need a few more years." "Grameenphone took 10 years to float, where we are only two years old. We need more time to join the competition," he added. Warid Telecom, a concern of the Abu Dhabi Group, one of the largest groups in the Middle East and in Pakistan, committed to the government to invest $750 million in the Bangladesh telecommunication sector. The company launched its commercial operations in Bangladesh, with a network encompassing 26 districts, in May 10, 2007. Currently, 61 districts, equal to 35 percent of the land, are under their network coverage.
