 By Syed Nahas Pasha London, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com)Two Bangladeshi teenagers in the UK, found guilty of manslaughter after the death of a Pakistani restaurant waiter, have each been sentenced to 12 years at the London's Old Bailey High Court. Mohammed Shaubuzzaman, 19, and Bahar Uddin, 19, both from London's East End, were found guilty of the manslaughter of Syed Omar Islam at the Old Bailey on July 17. The 28-year-old Islam died following a fight at the Maida restaurant in Bethnal Green Road, in East London on Jan 15. The two nineteen year-olds were sentenced to 12 years on Friday. The pair were also sentenced to four years for a Section 18 assault and two years for a Section 20 assault on other men that occurred during the incident - all sentences will run concurrently. The successful convictions followed an appeal for information following Islam's assault and death at the busy restaurant. Police officers had been called to a disturbance, involving approximately 20 people, at the Maida on the night of Jan 15. Islam had received a blow to the head and died of his injuries. He was a Pakistani national who was studying IT in the UK, living on Bethnal Green Road, and working part-time as a waiter at the restaurant. Detective Inspector Carl Mehta of Metropolitan Police, who led the investigation, said: "This is a case where a small and insignificant argument resulted in the use of excessive violence." Mehta said weapons were used by two young men to resolve their differences with another group of youngsters who were simply enjoying an evening meal at the retaurant. "I would like to thank the staff and customers at the Maida restaurant and residents in the Bethnal Green area who assisted and provided evidence in the investigation."
