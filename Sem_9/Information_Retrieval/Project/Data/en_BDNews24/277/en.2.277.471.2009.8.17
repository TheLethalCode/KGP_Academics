<TITLE> I can run 9.4 seconds, says champion Bolt </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Berlin, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Not one to mince his words, newly crowned 100 metres world champion Usain Bolt said he could run the distance in 9.4 seconds after shattering his own world record with a time of 9.58 in the Berlin final Sunday. Bolt thundered to victory and a world championship gold medal, slashing 0.11 seconds off the mark he set at last year's Beijing Olympics. He left American Tyson Gay to settle for silver in 9.71 and fellow Jamaican Asafa Powell in third. "I said 9.4. I think it will stop at 9.4 but you never know," Bolt told reporters. "We'll just keep racing," the 22-year-old said after his mesmerising run. "I don't run for world records. The aim was just to come and execute because it was going to be a tough race. I got a pretty good start. I was there at 20 metres and that was it," he said. Gay, who has struggled with a nagging groin injury, said Bolt's race proved humans could run even faster. "I've been telling you someone could run 9.5. I'm happy he did it," said the softly-spoken American. "It showed a human can take it to another level. Unfortunately, I wasn't the one to do it but I still have confidence I can do it one day." Gay said he dealt with his injury as best he could. "I showed a lot of heart. I didn't complain about my groin injury. I put it together the best I could," the 27-year-old told reporters. "My groin, it is barely hanging on." The pair are due to meet again in the 200m with the final set for Thursday, though Gay's agent Mark Wetmore said the sprinter's participation would be discussed with his doctor on Monday.
