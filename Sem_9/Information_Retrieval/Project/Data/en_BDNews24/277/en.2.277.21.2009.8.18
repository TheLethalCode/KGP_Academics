 Dhaka, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com)--British high commissioner in Dhaka Stephen Evans met with BNP MP Salahuddin Quader Choudhury at Choudhury's Dhanmondi house on Tuesday. They spent one and a half hours. "It was a courtesy meeting. We have discussed development assistance, climate change and British government's policy towards Bangladesh", Evans said after the meeting. Choudhury said, "It was an introductory meeting with the British high commissioner. We have had conversation on political and climate issues." On query from reporters, he said, "He enquired about my family and I also did the same. He is a foreign diplomat in our country. So I don't want to say anything beyond what he has said." Choudhury had criticised the role of British high commissioner Anwar Choudhury and EU, Germany and UN diplomats in the country during Jan 11, 2007 changeover.
