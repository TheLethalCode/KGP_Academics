<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com)A mobile court will start operating in the city from Friday tasked with seizing all illegal vehicles plying the roads, in a move designed to reduce ever worsening traffic jams in the capital, a minister said on Thursday. "The government has taken up a number of plans to reduce traffic jams in Dhaka, and the city's gridlock will be reduced if the plans are implemented properly," communications minister Syed Abul Hossain told reporters after a meeting at the secretariat. No one will be spared by the mobile court drive, including public officials, said Hossain. He said the meeting had also discussed the possibility of closing schools and colleges in Dhaka over Ramadan to further reduce the city's chronic gridlock. "A decision on this will be taken in consultation with the concerned ministry," said Hossain. Hossain said a committee had been formed to consider the matter of the school closures, headed by additional-secretary of the roads and railways department of the ministry, Shafique Alam Mehdi. The communications minister said many initiatives had been taken by earlier administrations to reduce the capital's traffic jams, but all had failed due to a lack of proper implementation and political will.
