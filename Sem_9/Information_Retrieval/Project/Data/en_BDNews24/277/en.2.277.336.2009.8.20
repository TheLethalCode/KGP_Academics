 Dhaka, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com)Health minister AFM Ruhal Haque has called upon people not to panic as the number of confirmed swine flu cases reached 87 on Thursday, from just 37 last week. He suggested that people across the country should go to their nearest health centre if they have any respiratory problems coupled with fever. He also told people to be aware of simple measures they could take to prevent spread of the H1N1 virus. "People must use handkerchiefs when sneezing. One should refrain from spitting in public and should wash hands using soap and water after fits of coughing," the minister told a briefing on Thursday after an inter-ministerial meeting at the Secretariat. "The total number of confirmed swine flu cases in the country has reached 87. Of them, 32 have recovered," Haque said. According to figures provided by the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research, the number of cases was just 37 as recently as Aug 15. Haque said: "We have handled the situation well so far. The authorities have been directed to beef up preparations to deal with the situation for the future." The minister said there were concerns that the virus might spread further as it had spread widely in Kolkata in neighbouring India. But, he added, sufficient stocks of flu drugs were in place. "We have a stock of 32 lakh doses for treating H1N1. It is also possible to manufacture the medicine in our country," Haque said. The health directorate director general Shah Monir Hossain, state minister for health Mojibur Rahman Fakir, IEDCR director Dr Mahmudur Rahman and other officials were present in the briefing. The health minister had said on Sunday that the regional rise in reported cases of the H1N1 virus was "alarming" for Bangladesh, although the country was prepared to deal with the situation. In India, over 2,200 people have tested positive for the H1N1 virus to date, with 28 reported deaths, an Indian ministry of health and family welfare update said on Wednesday. Screening measures were recently beefed up at Bangladesh's 11 land ports in a bid to check entry of the flu cases from India. Symptoms of the virus include fever with high temperature and respiratory problems. Bangladesh authorities advise schools and offices to grant leave to anyone who displays symptoms of the flu. Health officials also advise people to refrain from spitting and to wash their hands regularly to curb the spread of the flu virus. bdnew
