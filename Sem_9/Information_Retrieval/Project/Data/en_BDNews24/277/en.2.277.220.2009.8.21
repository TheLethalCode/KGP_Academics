<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has said the big guns behind the Aug 21, 2004 grenade attack on the Awami League rally will be hounded out and tried however powerful they are. She alleged that the BNP-Jamaat-led coalition government had been involved with all bomb attacks. "We are working to build a happy and prosperous Bangladesh by eliminating militancy and terrorism from the country," she said at a discussion meeting in Dhaka to mark the fifth anniversary of the grisly attack. Deputy leader in parliament and Awami League presidium member Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury presided over the discussion at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh auditorium. "We must free Bangladesh from the curse of being a country of killers," Hasina said. The prime minister called on the people to be vigilant and cautious of all conspiracies. "Bombs-grenades attacks were launched to make [Bangladesh] a country of unrest by destroying its history and tradition. " But we must build it as a peaceful, hunger- and poverty-free country if the people and [the party] remain united." "Those who reared militancy, terrorism are active until now. (General Ziaur Rahman, late president and BNP founder) released 11,000 convicted war criminals after the killing of Father of the Nation Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1975." "[He] amended the constitution to revoke the penalty and awarded the killers. It is his family that takes revenge on the people of the country whenever they came to power." Hasina promised to curb militancy and terrorism. The ruling AL president called on party leaders and workers to help out the families of those that were killed and injured in Aug 21 grenade attack. Many injured in the attack were present at the meeting. Reminiscing about Aug 21, she said, "I was saved that day as Allah wished." "But why were the grenades that should be used in war field used on a political rally?" "Where was the training imparted to those that detonated the grenades at the rally?" "Same grenades were found in the central jail and graveyard. A jailor had also been given a lot of money. These have to be found out through investigation," Hasina added. "We wanted to discuss that heinous incident in parliament, instead, propaganda was launched against us." "The then prime minister satirically said,'Who will want to kill her (Hasina)?' The BNP-Jamaat government withdrew the special security for me before the attack." "Khaleda Zia made Abdus Salam Pintu's brother Chhatra Dal president as a show of the faith and trust in those involved with the grenade attack." "It proves that she had backed the attack." Referring to the Aug 17, 2005 serial blasts across the country, the prime minister said, "Such an attack is not possible without the government's assistance." "Because guerrillas could attack three out of five targets during independence war." "But in a half-hour gap, it is impossible to plan and attack 500 sites." "We do politics. Let's be faced politically. But the opposition wants to eliminate us wholly. They are repeating this dirty plot." bdne
