The chief executive officers of 61 district councils and their secretaries attended the meeting. Nanak asked the officials to work as a bridge between the government and the people and blamed them for failing to adequately supervise projects under their purview in the past. "This practice will end, now the administration is functioning properly," said Nanak. Also present at the meeting were additional-secretary of the ministry, Syed Mahbub Zaman, and joint-secretary Prasanta Bhusan Barua.
