<TITLE> Flintoff confident of Ashes fitness </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff expressed full confidence Tuesday that he would be fit for the final Test of his career in the deciding Ashes match against Australia at the Oval this week. England need to win the fifth Test starting Thursday if they are to regain the Ashes. The series is tied 1-1. Flintoff bowled England to victory in the second Test at Lord's but missed the fourth Test loss at Headingley in Leeds when the selectors decided his injured right knee would not stand up to the stress of a five-day match. At a news conference Tuesday Flintoff, who will retire from Test cricket after the Ashes series following a daunting sequence of serious injuries, said he not bowled since the drawn third Test but had concentrated on rehabilitation on the knee which required an operation this year. He practised Tuesday with a brace on his heavily strapped right knee and went through his paces in the nets without showing any obvious discomfort. "I have been trying to get ready for this one which is going to be an unbelievably good game," he said. "I am confident that I will be all right but as I say I have to prove it. "I am sure there will be an element of swelling, however that can be managed. Using various treatments I can get the swelling down. "For the past week I have been getting fit for this Test match. It will be the biggest I have ever played, not because it's been my last but because of the position of the series." Flintoff, 31, who was the key England player in the epic 2005 Ashes series with both bat and ball, said he did not think the heavy defeat in the fourth Test would have any bearing on the course of the Oval Test. "It's quite exciting in the dressing room," he said. "People want to get going Thursday and play. "Momentum is a word everyone seems to use but it keeps swinging according to who you speak to. I think this Test match is more of a one-off. "It's how the teams react to the pressure on such a big occasion. I think the team that does that best will take the honours at the end of it. "I think if we win it's going to be a far greater achievement than in 2005 -- 2005 was fantastic but the side had performed well over a period of time. We had beaten everybody in the world. "This side has gone through a lot over the last 12 months, the side has changed a hell of a lot. We have got young players who have never played in the Ashes."
