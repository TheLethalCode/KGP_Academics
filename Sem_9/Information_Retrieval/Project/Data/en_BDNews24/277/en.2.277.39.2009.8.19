 Dhaka, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com)An alleged criminal was killed in a gunfight with RAB after arrest at Agargaon in the capital early on Wednesday. Assistant police commissioner Talebur Rahman told bdnews24.com they had arrested Rafiqul Islam Panku, 32, at Banasree an hour before the gunfight. Panku told them that he had firearms and when the elite force went in front of Agargaon Music College at around 4am to recover those, Panku's associates fired on them, he claimed. The gunfight went on for "sometime" before the criminals fled the scene. Panku took bullets during the firefight and was taken to National Institute for Traumatology, Orthopedics and Rehabilitation and later to Suhrawardy Hospital where the doctors declared him dead. RAB also recovered one revolver, Rahman said.
