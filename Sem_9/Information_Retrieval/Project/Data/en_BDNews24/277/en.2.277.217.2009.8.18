 Dhaka, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com)-The International Commission on Chittagong Hill Tracts on Tuesday recommended making the Land Commission effective to return the disputed lands in the hills region to their original owners. Lord Eric Avebury, one of the three vice chairs of the commission, made the suggestions at a press conference at the National Press Club after a three-day tour of three CHT districts. "We talked with various sections of people, especially indigenous people, people rehabilitated there, the army and local administration. After the discussions, we came to know that it needs quick solution to disputes over the ownership of lands," Avebury said. "Thereafter, they told me that there will be no security hampered in the withdrawal of temporary army camps." The international commission also suggested that the government hold elections to CHT Regional Council and three district councils. It hailed the partial army pullout from three CHT districts and other government initiatives for the region. International Commission on CHT co-chairmen Ida Nicolasan and Sultana Kamal were also present at the conference. b
