<TEXT>
 Bagerhat, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com)Shipping minister Shahjahan Khan said on Thursday that long-standing problems with Mongla Port would have to be resolved before construction of the planned Padma Bridge at Mawa is completed. "Mongla Port will emerge as the biggest port in the country if construction of the Padma bridge goes ahead as planned," Enamul Haque, Mongla Port's harbour master, quoted the minister as saying at a meeting at the port authority's administrative building. Haque said the meeting was told facilities at the port had to be strengthened, with massive dredging operations and purchase of large amounts of modern equipment necessary to bring the port up to the required standard. "The prime minister ordered me to ensure the port is fit for purpose," the shipping minister told the meeting, attended by officials of the port. Khan said foreign investors would use Mongla Port if the planned bridge over the Padma River was realised. On Aug 6, the communications minister said the World Bank had pledged another $160 million for construction of the Padma bridge at Mawa, raising its total loan assistance for the project to $460m. Communications minister Syed Abul Hossain, however, said the government still had a funding deficit for the almost $2 billion bridge project. The minister also held talks with leaders of Mongla Bandar Karmachari Union and Mongla Bandar Shipping Karmachari Union over a slew of demands, including timely payment of wages and bonuses. bd
