 Dhaka, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Export Processing Zone Authority (BEPZA) on Sunday returned 59 acres of land and 94 warehouses to the government, which had been allocated by the immediate past caretaker administration on the advice of the World Bank. SM Golam Kibria, public-relations officer at the food ministry, told reporters that the land contained 94 warehouses in total, although only 35 of them were in a usable condition. Kibria said the 35 usable warehouses had a capacity of 35,200 tonnes and the government intended to utilise them to mitigate shortfalls in national food storage facilities. Executive chairman of BEPZA, Jamil Ahmed Khan, handed over legal documents for the land and warehouses to the secretary of the ministry of food and disaster management at the secretariat. The caretaker government handed over the land to BEPZA towards the end of 2006, at the instigation of the WB, after the initiative was processed by the previous BNP-led administration. Food minister Abdur Razzaq and director-general of the directorate of food, Pius Costa, attended the handing over ceremony. bdne
