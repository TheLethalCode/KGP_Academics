<TITLE> Assembly may reject some Ahmadinejad ministers: MP </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TEHRAN, Aug 20, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A senior Iranian MP served notice on Thursday that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad will face a tough battle to secure approval for his new cabinet, saying the assembly was likely to reject several proposed ministers. The outcome will be another test of how secure Ahmadinejad's grip is on power in the major oil exporter after his June re-election led to street protests and political turmoil. Vice speaker Mohammad Reza Bahonar, a pragmatic conservative who has been critical of the hardline president in the past, suggested up to five members of Ahmadinejad's 21-strong cabinet risked being voted down by parliament. He did not give names. The nominated ministers included current Commerce Minister Massoud Mirkazemi as the new oil minister, a key position since crude sales account for most state revenue. He is seen as an Ahmadinejad ally but has little known oil industry experience. Parliament must approve the nominees and Ahmadinejad may get a rough ride from conservatives who dominate the assembly, as well as from moderate foes who see his government as illegitimate after the disputed presidential election. Speaking after Iranian media said the president on Wednesday evening submitted his proposed government list to parliament, Bahonar was quoted as saying by Mehr News Agency: "Some of my colleagues and I ... are of the opinion that close to five ministers proposed by Ahmadinejad will not receive a vote of confidence." ISNA news agency also carried his comments. Another conservative MP, Javad Karimi Qodousi, predicted 80 percent of the nominated ministers would be approved, the semi-official Fars News Agency said. The Kayhan newspaper quoted a parliamentary spokesman as saying voting would start on the cabinet on Aug 30. Among the nominees, Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki would retain his job and three women would become ministers for health, social welfare and education respectively. It would be the first time a woman becomes minister in the Islamic Republic. "TOUGH" PARLIAMENT State media said Ahmadinejad would deliver a televised speech after nine p.m. (1630 GMT), postponed from Wednesday, to introduce his cabinet and talk about its goals. "Ahmadinejad has made unexpected nominations and appointments including to the oil ministry in the past, favouring close aides over candidates with relevant experience," said Gala Riani of IHS Global Insight. The new oil minister faces the challenge of boosting oil and gas output under U.S. and U.N. sanctions, imposed because of a dispute over Iran's nuclear programme. The West suspects Iran of seeking to build nuclear weapons. Iran says its programme is only for peaceful power generation. Ahmadinejad, who was re-elected for a second four-year term in the June 12 vote, failed to get his first three choices for oil minister appointed in 2005 because of parliamentary opposition. Some of his supporters have abandoned him after the disputed vote which led to the most serious disturbances since the 1979 Islamic revolution, even though he enjoys the backing of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's highest authority. "If the proposed ministers do not have the necessary experience and knowledge ... and are not able to carry out their duty, parliament will act tough with them," conservative member of parliament Parviz Sarvari told ISNA news agency. Several key nominees -- Mirkazemi and the intelligence and interior ministers -- have a background with the elite Revolutionary Guards (IRGC). Mirkazemi is a former deputy head of a Guards university. Seen as fiercely loyal to the values of the Islamic Republic, the force's influence appears to have grown since Ahmadinejad came to power in 2005. Two-thirds of his first 21-man cabinet four years ago were IRGC veterans, like himself. Media said current Defence Minister Mostafa Mohammad Najjar -- a high-ranking Guards officer -- was proposed as interior minister. ISNA said Ahmad Vahidi, a commander, was the nominee for defence minister. Heydar Moslehi, Khamenei's former representative in the Guards' ground force, would become intelligence minister after his predecessor was sacked and Economy Minister Shamseddin Hosseini would retain the p
