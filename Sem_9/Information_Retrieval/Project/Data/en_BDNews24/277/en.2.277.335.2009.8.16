<TEXT>
 Bagerhat, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com)Over a thousand casual workers, who lost their jobs at Mongla Port due to a change in labour laws in 2008, are set to hold a mass sit-in protest at the seaport from Monday after their demands for reemployment and payment of arrears failed to produce any results. However, Commander Enamul Haque, Mongla port's harbour master, told bdnews24.com that the casual workers who had lost their jobs had no direct relationship with the port. "They have no scope to hamper the port's activities," said Haque, who added that two ships were presently docked at the port. Mongla police chief, Kazi Zalal Uddin Ahmed, said he was aware of the planned action and was keeping an eye on the situation. The movement's leaders told bdnews24.com on Thursday that they had informed the port's authority and Mongla Port Stevedores Association in writing about their planned action. Mongla Port Shipping Workers Union president Shamsul Alam said that members of the union were owed at least Tk 8,800,000 by the port's Stevedores Association that employed them as casual hands at the port. Alam said their demands included reintroduction of the call station system for casual workers, that was cancelled according to amendments in labour law last year. They also demanded payment of due death allowances, payment of 'golden handshakes' promised to 741 workers in 2005, and payment of arrears in wages as per conditions laid down in an earlier agreement. He said at least 50 workers had died since 2007 who were members of their union, and whose entitled allowances to families were yet to be paid. bdnews24
