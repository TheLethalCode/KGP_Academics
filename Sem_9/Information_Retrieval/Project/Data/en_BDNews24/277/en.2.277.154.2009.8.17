<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 17(bdnews24.com)A CAAB probe committee on Monday interviewed the 10 crewmembers of an Indian Jet Airways flight and examined the aircraft to gain clues as to why it had veered off a runway at Zia International Airport, holding up flights for more than two hours, earlier in the day. Zia International Airport director, wing commander Saeedul Hasan Khan, told bdnews24.com that the plane, scheduled for a 10.43am take-off, came out of Hangar Bay 9 and during a turn to line-up on Runway 14 veered across a grass verge. No casualties or damage to the aircraft were reported, but take-off and landing were suspended for two and a half hours from around 11am as the plane was towed away. The Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh formed a four-member probe committee soon after the incident. Committee head, wing commander Kamrul Islam, told bdnews24.com later that evening: "We have taken interviews of pilot, co-pilots and other crew members on the flight." Engineers had also examined the aircraft, he said. The 121 passengers of the Indian Jet Airways flight 271 were accommodated on another plane. "It was a small accident. So we are priotising on finding out the cause instead of meting out penalty," said Islam. He added that the crewmembers were allowed to go as interviews ended. "Engineers have also examined the plane. It did not incur much damage and it can take off any time." He said they already gave permission to the plane to depart that night. Islam said his committee might take 8-10 days altogether to complete its report and any recommendations. Airport police chief Abu Saleh Md Shamsuddin told bdnews24.com immediately after the accident that morning, "The passengers were evacuated fast. No one sustained any injury." He said flights resumed at 1.30pm after the plane was towed away to an airport hangar. Flights disrupted Several flights were disrupted during the down time, said airport authorities. Two planesa Bahrain-bound Gulf Airways and an Emirates bound for Dubaihad been in queue for take-off at around 1pm as the Jet Airways mishap occurred. A Bangladesh Biman flight coming from Rome had to be diverted to Chittagong and a GMG Airlines flight was kept waiting in Calcutta en route to Dhaka. The Gulf Airways flight eventually took off at 1.36pm, while the Emirates flight departed at 2.13pm. Biman's Rome flight landed from Chittagong at 2.32pm and the GMG flight from Calcutta arrived at 2.45pm. bdnews24
