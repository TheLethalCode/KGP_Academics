 GALLE, Sri Lanka, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Opener Tim McIntosh scored a battling half-century as New Zealand reached lunch on 137 for three on the third day of the first Test against Sri Lanka on Thursday. McIntosh scored a workmanlike 53 from 161 balls with six boundaries, keeping Sri Lanka's bowlers at bay throughout a tough rain-shortened morning session. The hosts made made 452 in their first innings. McIntosh added 49 in 18 overs with night-watchman Jeetan Patel, who scored 26 before being trapped lbw by off spinner Muttiah Muralitharan. Ross Taylor was unbeaten on six at the break. The scheduled start was delayed by 90 minutes after early monsoon storms drenched the seaside venue.
