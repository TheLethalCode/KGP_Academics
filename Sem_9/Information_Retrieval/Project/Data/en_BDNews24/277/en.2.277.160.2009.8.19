<TITLE> Manpower export crunch to create another 3 lakh jobseekers: CPD </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh will see its ranks of job seekers swell by an additional 300,000 over the current fiscal year as the impact of the global financial crisis hits manpower exports, said a study released on Wednesday. Bearing in mind possible rises in unemployment, the study said increased investment in farming and non-farming rural sectors was necessary to boost employment outside urban areas. The study by Centre for Policy Dialogue, presented at a discussion, found the number of overseas workers fell by 57 percent in May this year, compared to the same month last year. "Around 17 lakh people went abroad during 2007 and 2008. However, the recent trend shows the number for the next two years may not exceed nine lakh," said CPD senior research associate Syed Saifuddin Hossain. It also said that the stimulus packages should have been aimed towards the retrenched workers of the export industry, and not only at entrepreneurs. CPD executive-director Mustafizur Rahman stressed the need for strategies to stimulate labour intensive sectors of the economy to absorb the surplus workforce resulting from the slowdown in manpower export. The global recession has also resulted in more cases of workers' rights violations, according to labour leader Mujibur Rahman Bhuiyan. "Some employers took advantage of the situation...termination of jobs happened without paying any benefits," said Bhuiyan. Bhuiyan came down hard on the government for not implementing labour laws. "Enforcing the labour law in line with ILO convention is a constitutional obligation of the government ... it should not be viewed as a challenge," he said. Summing up the discussion, CPD's Debapriya Bhattacharya said Bangladesh had just entered into the "impact cycle" of the global downturn. According to CPD, the ready-made garments sector has been worst affected by the global downturn, although the textile, jute, frozen foods, leather and ship-building sectors have also been affected. Bhattacharya advocated a shift in policy focus from the export sector to the labour market. "Labour market adjustment is much slower than that for the product and financial markets," said Bhattacharya. ILO Asia Pacific regional director Sachiko Yamamoto drew attention to another dimension of the crisis. "As new recruitment slows, employment creation declines. Young job-seekers are now facing hard times and uncertain job prospects," said Yamamoto. In 2008, young people in Asia were already more than three times as likely as adults to be unemployed, she added. The visiting ILO official said that she had met with prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Wednesday, and they had agreed to work together on schemes linking education and employment policies. The discussion was titled 'Impact of Global Financial Crisis on the Employment and Labour Market of Bangladesh', and was jointly organised by the ministry of labour, the International Labour Organisation and the CPD. bd
