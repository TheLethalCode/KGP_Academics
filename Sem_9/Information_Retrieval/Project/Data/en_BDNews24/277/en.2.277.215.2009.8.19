<TITLE> Jute sector still in doldrums: minister </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com)Textiles and jute minister Abdul Latif Siddiqui said on Wednesday that two more state-owned jute mills had begun operating since the government assumed power, although the mills were still haemorrhaging money due to rampant inefficiencies. "The government is paying out Tk 7,000 to Tk 8,000 crore every year because state-owned mills don't run efficiently, meanwhile private mills are operating at a profit," Siddiqui told reporters at the information ministry conference room at the secretariat. Siddiqui said few workers had been hired in the sector since 1980, which had led to chronic manpower shortages at state-owned jute, textile and cotton-yarn spinning mills. "I don't think only corruption or ignorance is causing such losses. I suggest these sectors were forced into becoming losing concerns for various reasons," he said, in a reference to alleged long-standing misappropriation of government funds in the sector. Siddiqui said there were now 14 state-owned jute mills operating in the country. He also said Tk 100 crore of salary arrears owed to employees in state-owned concerns had now been paid, out of a total Tk 600 crore arrears. "The remainder will be paid soon, and cases involving disabled and deceased workers will be treated as a priority," said the minister. When asked, Siddiqui said a decision on whether the Adamjee Jute Mill should be re-commissioned was not solely within the purview of his ministry, and would require a full state decision. bdne
