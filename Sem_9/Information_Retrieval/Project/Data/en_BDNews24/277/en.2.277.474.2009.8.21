 Moinul Haque Chowdhury bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com)--The Election Commission is unwilling to discuss the issue of whether the caretaker government system should remain during the planned upcoming dialogue with political parties. "A national debate should decide whether or not to continue with the system. But it would not be on the Election Commission's agenda," election commissioner Mohammed Shakhawat Hossain told bdnews24.com on Thursday. "But political parties could place their opinion before the Election Commission in the dialogue for its opinion." If the commission wants to remove the caretaker government system mandated to see the country through general elections, then huge changes would be required to the Representation of the People Order. Mohammed Sohul Hussain echoed his colleague. "Cancellation of the caretaker government system requires drastic changes to the constitution. So the parliament will decide about that." Sohul said another planned dialogue between the EC and political parties over election laws could be held in the Ramadan. The EC sat with the political parties about the same time last year in the run-up to last December's parliamentary elections. Earlier in the week, last Tuesday, Awami League general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam said that the caretaker government "experiment" had failed, and a national debate should decide whether or not to continue with the system. He said the time had come to rethink the interim government system, and all those involved in the electoral process should debate the issue. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain criticised Syed Ashraf for his comments over caretaker government on the next day. Delwar said the AL-led Grand Alliance government was intent on doing away with the caretaker government system since it wanted to control the next elections. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda on Aug 12 said the caretaker government system was for political parties to decide and the EC's main concern was the security of the voters. "If there are honest efforts, fair polls can be held under a political government." Deputy leader of the parliament Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury had called the parliament members to abolish the caretaker government system on June 28 during the budget session of parliament. "The caretaker government would be redundant if the Election Commission is strengthened," she said. The system had been introduced after the political unrest in 1991. The AL strongly advocated the system at that time, while a reluctant BNP eventually conceded to the proposal. The two main political parties have reversed their role on the issue.
