 Dhaka, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com) -- Zimbabwe batsman Charles Coventry has vaulted into the top 100 of the ICC player rankings for ODI batsmen after his record-equaling knock of 194 against Bangladesh in the recently concluded ODI series. Coventry, who equalled Pakistan opener Saeed Anwar's record for the highest individual ODI score against India at Chennai in 1997, has rocketed 103 places and now occupies 83th position in the latest rankings released by the International Cricket Council on Wednesday. The 26-year-old, who in 1998/99 became Zimbabwe's youngest first-class player at the age of 15 years and 303 days, achieved the feat in the fourth ODI at Bulawayo when he clobbered seven sixes and 16 fours in a 156-ball innings. However, Coventry's party was spoiled by Bangladesh opener Tamim Iqbal who now sits in 36th position after rising two places. The left-hander belted six sixes and seven fours in a 138-ball 154 that helped the tourists to achieve the 313-run victory target with four wickets and 13 balls to spare. While there is no change in the top 20 batsmen, Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan, who scored 170 runs in the series, edges closer to a place in the top 20 by climbing four places to sit in 25th spot. Raqibul Hasan, who was Bangladesh's second most successful batsman after Tamim with 183 runs, has jumped 19 places to 63rd spots, respectively. Meanwhile, Sean Williams and Elton Chigumbura have become Zimbabwe's only batsmen inside the top 50 after rising nine and six places to occupy 47th and 50th spots. Hamilton Masakadza, Brendon Taylor and Stuart Matsikenyeri have also made movements in the right directions with Masakadza rising four places to 56th position, Taylor jumping five places to 59th spot and Matsikenyeri leaping four places to 71st position. In the ICC player rankings for ODI bowlers, Shakib Al Hasan has conceded his second position while Mashrafe Bin Mortaza has dropped out of the top 10. Shakib has slipped two places to fourth spot, allowing New Zealand pair of Kyle Mills and Daniel Vettori to rise to second and third positions while Mashrafe has dropped two places to 11th spot after missing the series with a knee injury. The biggest mover is Zimbabwe left-arm spinner Ray Price who sits just outside the top 20 in 21st position after jumping 16 places. The 33-year-old was the leading wicket-taker in the series with eight wickets. Shakib may have slipped in the bowling table but his improvement in the batting ranking has helped him to retain the number one position in the ICC player rankings for ODI all-rounder which remains uncha
