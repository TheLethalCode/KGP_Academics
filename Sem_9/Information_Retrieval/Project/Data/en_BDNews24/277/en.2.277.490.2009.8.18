<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary body has asked state-owned banks to introduce mortgages for middle-class families to allow them to take possession of their housing without having to take out costly short-term loans or pay the full amount up front. Banks in many countries provide mortgaged loans for homebuyers, Oli Ahmad, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on the planning ministry, told bdnews24.com after a meeting of the committee on Tuesday. "Clients would live in their houses while paying monthly installments to the banks; they would become the owners on paper after they repay the whole amount," Ahmad said. If introduced, Ahmad said, the target group would mainly be the lower middle-class. Senior officials of state-owned banks attended the meeting. "They said they would examine the proposal," said Ahmad, who is the House's lone opposition MP from the Liberal Democratic Party. The standing committee meeting also recommended scrapping a provision allowing loan defaulters the opportunity to reschedule their debts, he said. "Loan defaulters simply swindle more money by exploiting the provision allowing rescheduling of the loans. It must stop," said Ahmed. Nazrul Islam MP, also on the committee, told bdnews24.com that every year loan defaulters only pay 10 percent interest to reschedule their loans, and therefore escape repaying the debt. According to Bangladesh Bank data, defaulters hold about Tk 25,000 crore of public and the private banks' funds
