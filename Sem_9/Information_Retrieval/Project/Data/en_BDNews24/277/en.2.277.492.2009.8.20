<TITLE> Past breaks in democracy still hampering governance: PM's adviser </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh's past breaks from democracy continues to hamper good governance, HT Imam, an adviser to the prime minister, said on Thursday. Ensuring the rule of law is the most important component in establishing good governance in the country, he told guests at a discussion at the Sonargaon Hotel. "The fundamental requirement for good governance is a strong democratic system, with the rule of law," said Imam, the prime minister's establishment and administration adviser. Imam said suspension of the democratic process by previous military rulers had been a key obstacle to establishing good governance in the country. "Military rulers passed an indemnity law barring trial of the killers of the head-of-state in 1975, which is at the root of the lack of law and order in the country," said Imam. He said that the killing of independence architect Sheikh Mujibur Rahman led to a history of political killings and violence in the country. The eruption of militancy in the country is also an outcome of the failure to establish the rule of law, said Imam. "To achieve rule of law we must have a fair democratic system," he said. A study by Dhaka University teacher Mohammad Mohabbat Khan, presented at the discussion, said tackling corruption was the "first and foremost challenge" to maintaining good governance. "Meanwhile, controlling law and order, curbing prices and overhauling the educational system are the other priorities," said Khan, a professor of public administration at DU. Chairman of Square Group, Samson H Chowdhury, emphasised the need for accountability of government employees, especially regarding tax issues. "Differences in the accountability of tax payers and tax collectors needs to be removed," said Chowdhury. The discussion was attended by members of the International Business Forum of Bangladesh (IBFB), representatives of different aid agencies and other businessmen. It was supported by USAID. bd
