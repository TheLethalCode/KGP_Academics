 Dhaka, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com)The proposal for reform of Bangladesh Rifles including new name and insignia will be finalised upon guidelines from prime minister Sheikh Hasina, the border force's chief said on Wednesday. BDR director general Maj Gen Moinul Islam handed the proposal to Hasina at her office around noon. The prime minister's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad confirmed the handover. The proposal comprises a whole range of changes to the force's name, uniform, structure and personnel, following the BDR mutiny in February. "On being presented with the proposal, the prime minister made some comments," the BDR chief added. Islam told bdnews24.com that the prime minister said she would add some guidelines. "The proposal with the prime minister's added guidelines will be submitted officially to the home ministry." Faruque Khan, minister in charge of post-mutiny affairs, state minister for home Shamsul Huq Tuku and home secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikder were also present. Faruque said last month the reformation process was underway, while the government had decided on the border force's new name and uniform. He said a questionnaire containing 18 queries was sent in May to former chiefs of BDR and around 6,000 professionals of the armed forces, police and RAB, asking for their suggestions on new names, uniform, organisational reform and training-related issues. The suggestions, in Bangla and English, for a new name were narrowed down to 10. Some seven or eight new designs for insignia were also shortlisted. bdnew
