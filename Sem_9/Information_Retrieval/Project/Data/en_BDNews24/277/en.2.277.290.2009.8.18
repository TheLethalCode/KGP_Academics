 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary panel has recommended giving special civil service examinations to medical graduates to fill vacant doctors' posts in government hospitals. "Why should medical students have to study general subjects like statistics to get jobs as physicians in the government hospitals?" M Amanullah, head of a sub-committee formed by the parliamentary standing committee on the health ministry, told bdnews24.com on Tuesday, after a meeting at the parliament building. Amanullah said they had also recommended cancellation of the common Bangladesh Civil Service examination for the doctors. He said further recommendations included making all government hospitals autonomous to bring much needed improvements to the country's faltering health service. The committee will recommend amending the public procurement regulations to allow for the purchase of much needed high-quality medical equipment for the public hospitals, he said. "The Public Service Commission must give Medical BCS for the doctors," he said. The panel chief said the Public Service Commission had previously conducted similar Medical BCSs for doctors. "Those who made provisions (of general BCS for the doctors) have done huge harm to the nation," said Amanullah, a physician and former state minister for health and family welfare. He said if special BCS were not arranged, there would be no doctors at government hospitals for the foreseeable future. Amanullah said the paucity of doctors had become so acute that the government had to appoint 6,000 physicians on an ad hoc basis. In the current examination system, medical graduates must sit a 100-mark preliminary examination on miscellaneous subjects to become eligible to appear in the written tests. But few of the medical graduates pass the preliminary examinationa precondition to passing the BCS examination. "According to the sub-committee's findings, the health system at the district and upzilla levels has already collapsed, mainly due to the shortage of doctors there," he said. The former state minister said on an average there were two-to-three doctors against ten posts at each the upzilla hospital. "To better manage the government hospitals, they should be made autonomous," said Amanullah. He said the government should make provisions for setting up hospital management committees at the upzilla and districts levels to improve their management. The committee chief said Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University hospital used to perform 80,000 operations per year after becoming autonomous. "Previously, under government management, the hospital used to perform only 10,000 operations," he said. According to health ministry data, there are 44,632 registered doctors and 432 upzilla health centres in Bangladesh. Public Procurement Regulation, 2003. The sub-committee also termed the Public Procurement Regulation for 2003 as one of the main causes of the supply of sub-standard medical equipment to public hospitals. "As per the provisions of the PPR, the government cannot mention any brand name or country of origin in the tender to purchase medical equipment. "Utilising the provisions, a new syndicate developed over the supply of sub-standard medical instruments to the government hospitals," said Amanullah. "Therefore, we have recommended amending the PPR so the government can name the companies and their countries of origin," he said. Amanullah said instruments made in Germany and China could have the same specifications, but would not be of the same quality. "We spend hard-earned money. We have to maximise our resources," he said, criticising the World Bank, which pushed for framing of the provision in the PPR. He said two highly expensive 'linear accelerators', used in the treatment of cancer, had broken at two government hospitals shortly after they were procured. "Each of the machines cost about Tk 12 crore. But have remained unused for years," he said. The sub-committee's suggestions will go to the parliamentary standing committee on the health ministry for final recommendation from the ministry
