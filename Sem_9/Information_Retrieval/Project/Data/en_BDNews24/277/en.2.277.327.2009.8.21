 Dhaka, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com)Land minister Rezaul Karim Hira said on Thursday the government is firm in its resolve to retrieve all publically owned land from illegal occupancy, even from the hands of Awami League 'activists'. "The government will take all necessary legal steps to retrieve the public land," Hira told reporters at the Dhaka Reporters Unity auditorium. He said all government, or khas , land would be reclaimed regardless of who claimed ownership, including those who claim links to the ruling party. By June this year, a government project to provide land for destitute families had distributed publically owned land to over 12,000 families throughout the country. Over Tk 180 crore was allocated to implement the plan. Hira said his ministry would investigate all allegations of irregularities by committed by upzila committees, and others, regarding the distribution of government land. He also said his ministry had received a number of complaints regarding a project to build housing for poor and lower-middle-class families on government land in the Bhashantek area in Dhaka. "Steps will be taken after a full investigation of the allegations is completed," said Hira. Hira, however, said he could not say how much government owned land had been recovered since the present government assumed power. bdnew
