 LONDON, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com.Reuters) - Didier Drogba struck in stoppage time to mark Carlo Ancelotti's first Premier League match in charge of Chelsea with a 2-1 victory over Hull City on Saturday. Italian Ancelotti enjoyed an encouraging pre-season with Chelsea since joining the club from AC Milan, beating champions Manchester United on penalties in last week's traditional curtain-raiser at Wembley, but he was given a fright as the eagerly-awaited league season kicked off at Stamford Bridge. Hull's new signing Stephen Hunt, booed throughout by Chelsea fans because of a tackle that left goalkeeper Petr Cech with a fractured skull in 2006 when the Irishman played for Reading, shot Hull in front just before the half hour mark. The visitors, who survived their first season in the top flight by the skin of their teeth in May, enjoyed their lead for just nine minutes before Ivory Coast striker Drogba curled a free kick past Boaz Myhill. Ancelotti tinkered with his trusty midfield diamond formation at halftime, bringing on Michael Ballack for John Obi Mikel and the hosts duly pummelled Hull for most of the second half without breaking through. However, as they so often do, Chelsea struck at the death. Drogba appeared to have no angle to attempt a shot but his delivery into the area deceived Myhill and the ball nestled into the net, prompting a wild celebration from Drogba who was booked for removing his shirt. Later on Saturday Manchester City parade their expensive new signings at Blackburn Rovers while Arsenal, who face Celtic in the Champions League playoff next week, begin their Premier League campaign at Everton. Champions Manchester United begin their quest for a fourth consecutive title on Sunday against promoted Birmingham while last year's runners-up Liverpool go to Tottenham Hotspur. Ancelotti's first taste of Premier League football said much about England's top flight. While the eventual outcome of the 38-game haul is often predictable, nothing can be taken for granted, even against a team that managed just one win in their last 22 league games last season and who stayed up with a meagre 35 points. Chelsea had already received a couple of wake-up calls with George Boateng twice going close for Hull and they fell behind after 28 minutes when Boateng's shot deflected off Mikel and fell to debutant Hunt to score from 10 metres. Thankfully for Ancelotti Drogba, who signed a new three-year contract this month, sent a dipping free kick into the net before any murmurs of discontent were heard around the Bridge. The 31-year-old will be a vital component this season if Ancelotti is to snap United's hold on the title and win the Champions League, and he again proved his worth after Hull had soaked up a second-half onslaught. Two minutes into stoppage time, he took possession of the ball on the left hand edge of the penalty area and from an impossible angle lofted the ball over Myhill. Fluke or genius, it was just the start Ancelotti would have hoped
