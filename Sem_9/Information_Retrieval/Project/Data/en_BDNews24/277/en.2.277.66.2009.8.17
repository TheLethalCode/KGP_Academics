 Dhaka, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary panel will ask for information from the Public Service Commission on the appointment of 218 class-one social welfare officers who gained their positions between 2001 and 2006. The parliamentary standing committee on the social welfare ministry will also seek information on the recruitment of around 900 class-three and class-four employees appointed by during the tenure of the last BNP-led government. "During the rule of the BNP-led alliance 1,100 staff, including 218 grade-one officers, were appointed to the ministry of social welfare," Mozammel Hossain, the committee chairman, told reporters on Monday after a meeting at the parliament building. "On behalf of the committee, I will ask for information from the Public Service Commission as to whether it maintained the proper procedures in the appointment of the 218 class-one officers," said Hossain. He said the committee members felt there could have been irregularities in the appointments of the staff during BNP's five-year tenure. Jamaat-e-Islami secretary-general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojahid, an ally in the BNP-led alliance, was the social welfare minister during the period. "We have also told the ministry to provide information on the recruitment of class-three and class-four employees at the ministry," said Hossain, who was state minister for social welfare from June 1996 to June 2001. The committee chairman said the standing committee also recommended reducing the age limit for old age allowances. "We have recommended that poor people of 60 years of age will be permitted to receive old age allowances. At present, the age limit is 65 years," said the chairman. He said there would be a five-member panel at the union level to select individuals for the allowances, with the local MPs approving the final list of recipients. The Awami League government in its previous term introduced the old age allowances, with each recipient receiving Tk 200 per month. The allowance is now Tk 300 per month. "During the BNP's term, people of only 40 years got the old age allowance. The Gram Sarker [a controversial local government body created by the BNP and later dissolved by the High Court] was given responsibility of distributing the allowances," Hossain said.
