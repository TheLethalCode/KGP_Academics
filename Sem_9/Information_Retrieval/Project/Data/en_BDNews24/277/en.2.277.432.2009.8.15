 Dhaka, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com)One more case of swine flu has been confirmed in the country taking the total of detected cases to 37. Dr Mahmudur Rahman, director of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research, made the confirmation on Friday. IEDCR on Thursday asked government hospitals to prepare their outdoor patient wards for a potential influx of swine flu patients following reports of at least 18 fatalities from the H1N1 flu in India, with states there deciding to shut schools, malls and cinema halls and nearly a thousand people testing positive for the virus. "Training will be given to all doctors in the country," Dr Rahman told bdnews24.com, adding that Bangladesh had good stocks of flu drug, Tamiflu. Screening measures were recently beefed-up in the country's 11 land ports, since India began reporting fatalities. According to IEDCR, 31 individuals that were detected with the H1N1 virus have now made a full recovery, while six remain under surveillance. As of Thursday, Aug 13, the World Health Organisation had recorded over 160,000 cases of swine flu in 161 countries worldwide and 1,154 deaths. Symptoms of the virus include fever with high temperature and respiratory problems. Bangladesh authorities advise schools and offices to grant leave to anyone who displays symptoms of the flu. Health officials also advise people to refrain from spitting and to wash their hands regularly to curb the spread of the flu virus. bdnew
