<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh Rifles is set to hold the first gathering in Durbar Hall since the bloody events of last February, said BDR's director general on Saturday. "Monday will see the first organisational activity at the hall since the mutiny," BDR chief Maj Gen Moinul Islam told bdnews24.com. Dhaka BDR personnel have held one durbar since the mutiny, on the parade ground of the border force's Peelkhana headquarters, said Gen Moinul. But, he said, this will be the first meeting in Durbar Hall itself since Feb 26, when the force's annual durbar ended with a massacre of over 50 officers who were assembled at the hall, including Gen Moinul's predecessor, BDR chief Maj Gen Shakil Ahmed. "The situation in Peelkhana is now calm. Fifteen army officers (deputed to the border force) have already started residing there with their family members," said Gen Moinul. "I myself am living at Peelkhana. I hope all officers will be living there within a very short period," he said. "Some damaged buildings need repairing and that is going on. All army officers will move there respectively after the repair work is done," said the BDR chief. However, an army officer preferring not to be named told bdnews24.com that although he wanted to live there with his family as it was convenient for his service, his family members did not want him to. He said it was the same with army officers and their families. Gen Moinul said BDR members in Dhaka would attend Monday's function at Durbar Hall. Over seventy people were killed in the Feb 26-28 massacre, of whom 57 were army officers, the rest of the victims were BDR members and civilian bystanders. b
