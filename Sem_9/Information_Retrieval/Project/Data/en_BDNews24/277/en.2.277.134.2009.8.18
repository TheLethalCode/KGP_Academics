 Dhaka, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com)The country's capital markets is set to see some new issues floated this month with a commercial bank-sponsored mutual fund debuting Wednesday. Units of EBL First Mutual Fund, sponsored by Eastern Bank Ltd, will be traded on the bourses Wednesday with a face value of Tk 10 for each share. The Tk 100 crore mutual fund will be traded under the code 'EBL1STMF' on the Dhaka and Chittagong Stock Exchanges. At least four more initial public offerings worth almost Tk 100 crore are set to hit the markets by the end of the month. Meanwhile, issues of Marico Bangladesh Ltd, worth Tk 27 crore, Islami Insurance Bangladesh Ltd's Tk 9 crore and Dhaka Dyeing & Manufacturing Company's Tk 17 crore are soon to start trading on the bourses. And, another mutual fund worth Tk 20 crore, ICB AMCL 2nd Mutual Fund is also set to enter the market in August. The new offerings may not go far enough, however, to meet the market's dearth of share supply, say analysts. An indication of the scarcity of good issues is huge oversubscription of IPOs. Marico's offering closed last week oversubscribed by more than 600 percent. Lack of share supply is also the main cause of market manipulations, say market experts. "Too much money is running after too few shares and that's why the market often gets overheated leading to disaster," said Salahuddin Ahmed Khan, a former CEO of Dhaka Stock Exchange. Market regulators echoed Khan and said they are in the process of encouraging more shares to flow into the market. "Processing IPO approval tops our work agenda," Anwarul Kabir Bhuiyan, executive director of Securities and Exchange Commission said. He also said final approval of Grameen Phone's prospectus, for the telecom market leader's long-anticipated and record-breaking IPO, will come "very soon".
