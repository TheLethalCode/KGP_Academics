 DUBAI, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Australian cricket player has been approached by a bookmaker during the Ashes tour of England, the International Cricket Council said Wednesday. "I can confirm that the Australian team management have reported that their player was approached. It is being investigated by our ACSU (Anti-Corruption and Security Unit)," an ICC spokesman said by telephone. "We are full of praise for the player and the team management for promptly reporting this matter." The incident happened after the second Test at Lord's in July, the spokesman said, but declined to give further details. Cricket Australia declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. "Any anti-corruption issue in cricket is a matter for the ICC," Cricket Australia spokesman Philip Pope said. Australian media reported a player was approached in the bar of the team's London hotel. The report comes after an ICC investigation cleared Pakistan players last week of coming in contact with bookmakers during their recent tour in Sri Lanka. The Pakistan Cricket Board informed the ICC that it suspected bookmakers were staying on the same floor as their team hotel in Colombo after the tourists lost the Test series 2-0 and had lost the first three games of their five-match one-day series. The ICC spokesman said: "It would be naive to assume the issue has gone away and that is why we have the ACSU in place. "But this is also an illustration of the effectiveness the ACSU's education program and the culture of integrity that it promotes with the players."
