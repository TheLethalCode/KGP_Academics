 LONDON, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England batsman Ian Bell survived a torrid examination of his technique and temperament to reach 72 not out at tea on the opening day of the fifth Ashes Test against Australia at the Oval on Thursday. England, who must win to regain the Ashes, were 180 for three after an afternoon of attritional cricket during which two wickets fell for 72 runs. Captain Andrew Strauss, who set the pace in the morning session, was caught behind for 55 in the third over after the break as he played a limp defensive shot at Ben Hilfenhaus. Paul Collingwood then helped Bell add 62 for the third wicket before he was caught at gully by Michael Hussey off Peter Siddle for 24 after a loose drive.

At tea he had scored three. In the morning session, Strauss hit three boundaries through the leg-side in an over from Siddle to reach his half-century from 94 balls after winning his fourth toss of the series. He lost opening partner Alastair Cook for 10, playing at Siddle with an angled bat and edging a simple catch to Ricky Ponting at second slip. Play began under black clouds which rolled over the ground shortly before the scheduled start. The floodlights were turned on after 35 minutes and a few spots of rain fell but the darker clouds soon blew away and the sun appeared in the afternoon. England recalled Andrew Flintoff in place of Graham Onions while Australia kept the side that levelled the series 1-1 in the fourth Test at Headin
