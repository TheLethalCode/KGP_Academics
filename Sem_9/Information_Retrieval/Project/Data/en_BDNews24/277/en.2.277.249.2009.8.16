 Dhaka, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Sunday called on the people of Bangladesh to work for the benefit of the nation, rather than always thinking of personal gain. "Let us work together, turning our grief to strength, to complete the unfinished dreams of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman," said Hasina at a discussion to mark National Mourning Day at the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre in the city. She said developing the nation in line with the ideology of her father would be the ideal response to his killers. "The nation wants to see the verdict executed in the Bangabandhu murder trial to remove the shame attached to this dark chapter," said Hasina. She also said the ruling grand alliance had a tremendous responsibility to fight corruption and achieve economic independence for the country. "My father sacrificed his life because he loved the people of this country, and I too am trying to change the fate of the people. If needed, I will also sacrifice my life," she said. Also attending the event, law minister Kamrul Islam said a hearing on the Bangabandhu murder case would begin in the next few days. "We hope to have a final verdict in the case before December 16," said Islam. Senior Awami League leader Suranjit Sengupta said a case should also be filed against BNP leader Salahuddin Kader Chowdhury for his recent 'provocative comments' on the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, where he claimed the killing was inevitable. Presidium member Sayeda Sajeda Chowdhury presided at the event, which was also attended by Amir Hossain Amu, Abdur Razzak and Matia Chowdhury among others. bdnew
