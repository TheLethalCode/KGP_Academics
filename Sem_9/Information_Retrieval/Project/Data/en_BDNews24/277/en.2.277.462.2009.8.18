 LOS ANGELES, Aug 18,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A judge on Monday approved a deal for the sale of Michael Jackson merchandise, but delayed making a decision on a traveling exhibition dedicated to the King of Pop, amid objections from the singer's mother.

A public memorial for the singer was held in July, but there was never an official confirmation the "Thriller" singer was buried after the event. The reason behind Jackson's cardiac arrest remains a mystery.
