 GALLE, Sri Lanka, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka's Mahela Jayawardene scored an undefeated century as the hosts reached 293 for three at stumps on the first day of the first Test against New Zealand on Tuesday. The 32-year-old right-hander shared big partnerships with Tillakaratne Dilshan and Thilan Samaraweera to pile up 108 from 217 deliveries, including 14 boundaries.

Left-hander Tharanga Paranavitana edged a perfectly-pitched outswinger to be dismissed for a duck while skipper Kumar Sangakkara chipped a catch straight to square leg. New Zealand's luck then changed for the worse and Dilshan unleashed a flurry of extravagant strokes, hammering 40 runs from seamer Ian O'Brien's four-over burst with the new ball. He became the fastest Sri Lankan to bring up a test fifty, reaching the milestone in just 30 deliveries. O'Brien then gained revenge for his early mauling when Dilshan chopped on to his stumps after lunch, which was the last wicket to fall on Tuesday. Sri Lanka have recalled spinner Muttiah Muralitharan and wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene to the team after their recovery from injuries. The start of play was delayed for 90 minutes because of
