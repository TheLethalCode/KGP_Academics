 Dhaka, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com) -- Charles Coventry finished 194 not out to equal the highest score in a one-day international as Zimbabwe ended on 312-8 in 50 overs against Bangladesh in the fourth ODI of the GrameenPhone Cup at the Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo on Sunday. Needing three runs off the final ball of Syed Rasel's over to break Saeed Anwar's 12-year mark record, Coventry only slapped it for two runs back past the bowler wide of long-off to equal it. The right-hander faced 156 balls stroking 16 fours and seven sixes. Along the way, Coventry also became the highest-scoring Zimbabwean. He achieved the distinction after going past Craig Wishart's 172 against Namibia in the 2003 World Cup. "It's a great feeling. I had a bit of luck early on, I suppose that's the way things go. It's staying a bit low, I'm sure we can defend it." Coventry's short of words as he speaks after his team-mates congratulate him with a guard of honour. Zimbabwe, who the toss, made a magnificent recovery after pacer Mahbubul Alam made an early breakthrough removing Mark Vermeulen ( 5 ) who was caught at short midwicket by Junaed Siddique in the second over. Stuart Matsikenyeri was next top scorer with 37. Mahbubul and Enamul Haque Jr shared four wickets. Syed Rasel, Mohammad Ashraful and Naeem Islam bagged a wicket each. Bangladesh made only one change replacing Mehrab Hossain Jr, who played in Friday's third match which they lost by 69 runs, for opener Junaed Siddique. The Tigers lead the five-match series
