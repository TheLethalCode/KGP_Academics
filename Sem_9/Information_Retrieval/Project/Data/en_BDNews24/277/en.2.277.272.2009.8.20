<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 20 (bdnews24.com)The government has showed its autocratic stance by imposing a ban on peaceful activities, BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain says. "By imposing ban on a peaceful commemorative meeting the government has infringed on the people's basic right to freedom of expression," he said at a press briefing on Thursday protesting a ban on a BNP commemorative meeting at his Manikganj constituency. "The ban was imposed fearing that the meeting may discuss the government's failure," he told reporters at the opposition party's central office at Paltan in the capital. He said the local administration's claim that the ban was imposed due to security situation was not right, but was just "a lame excuse". He claimed government leaders were behind the ban. Commemorative and prayer meetings were arranged on Thursday for the late leaders and workers of BNP and its associate organisations at Daulatpur Upazila in Manikganj. But following objections from local Awami League, the administration there imposed a Section 144 ban on gatherings of more than five people from Wednesday night. Delwar and party MP Salahuddin Quader Chowdhur were supposed to take part in the programme as chief and special guests respectively. Asked whether he thought ban had anything to do with making Chowdhury the special guest, he said, "This is not right. Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury is a BNP leader and an MP and a citizen of this country. He cannot be prevented from speakinfg." He alleged that false cases were being filed and the opposition leaders and workers persecuted across the country. MP Barkat Ullah Bulu, Jatiyatabadui Jubo Dal general secretary Syed Moazzem Hossain Alal, officer secretary Rizvi Ahmed, Jatiyatabadi Muktijoddha Dal president Sohrab Uddin, Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal president Sultan Salahuddin Tuku, among others, were present. b
