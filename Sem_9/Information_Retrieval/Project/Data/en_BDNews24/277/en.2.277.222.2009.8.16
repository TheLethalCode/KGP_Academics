 Bandarban, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com)  Two rubber garden employees were abducted from Naikkhangchhari Upazila in Bandarban hill district on Sunday, police and local administration said. Twenty eight year-old Hefazetur Rahman and 24 year-old Nazer Miah, employees of a rubber cultivation project of the TCP Group, were taken from their office at around 2am, Naikkhangchhari police chief Obaidul Haque told bdnews24.com. Deputy commissioner Mizanur Rahman confirmed the news. "The police, administration and Bangladesh Rifles have already held a meeting on the matter," he said. The latest incident brings the total to five people abducted in Bandarban since the government declared troops withdrawal from the Chittagong Hill Tracts region at the end of last month. The previous three, abducted in two separate incidents, were released in exchange for ransom, locals said. Chittagong Hill Tract Regional Council chairman Santu Larma has said opponents of the CHT peace accord might be responsible for the latest spate of kidnappings in the area in an attempt to destabilise the peace process in the hill districts. bdnews
