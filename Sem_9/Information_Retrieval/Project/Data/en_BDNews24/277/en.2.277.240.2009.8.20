 Dhaka, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka's high-rises will not face threat of demolition, despite widespread violations of the national building code, a minister said on Thursday. Abdul Mannan Khan, state minister for housing and public works, told reporters that there was no provision in the code for demolishing buildings that failed to meet the required standard. "If anyone constructed buildings in violation of the building code, we will take legal action against them in line with the code," Khan told reporters after a meeting of the parliamentary standing committee on the housing and public works. The minister said there was no provision in the code which authorised RAJUK to raise the buildings. "There is provision of fining in the code. But you journalists write about demolishing buildings," Khan said. "We will not go crazy and demolish everything," said the minister hinting at measures taken by the previous caretaker government which dismantled thousands of "illegal" buildings across the country. "This is a democratic society. This is not a country of insane people. We will act as per the will of the people," said Khan. However, the minister's statement is different from the policies of previous governments. RAJUK, which looks after city's building construction, earlier demolished buildings for alleged violation of the building code. JS body's recommendations Unplanned urbanisation will consume the country's cultivable land by 2040 if it is not stopped now, the standing committee said at its meeting Thursday. The 10-member parliamentary body unanimously recommended the ministry to adopt a vertical housing policy to end the loss of agricultural land. "We have over 55,000 square miles of land. If urbanisation goes on at the present rate, there would be no cultivable land by 2040," ABM Fazle Karim Chowdhury, the committee chairman, told bdnews24.com at his parliament office Thursday. "Given the circumstances, the committee has recommended the ministry to prepare a policy on zoning," the chairman said. Zoning means, he said, the government would earmark areas for different purposes like industrial zone, residential zone, diplomatic zone and others. The chairman said his committee had suggested the ministry to come up with a draft of the zoning policy. "We will present the zoning policy as soon as possible," Abdul Mannan Khan told reporters after the meeting at parliament building. "We will promote vertical housing policy to save our agricultural land from depletion," he said. Khan said his ministry was preparing a housing policy not only for Dhaka, but also for the whole country. The minister told the meeting that the public works department would construct 4,256 flats in Mohakhali and Mirpur under the public-private partnership. "Besides, four satellite townships will be built under the public-private partnership initiative to lessen pressure on Dhaka," Khan said. bd
