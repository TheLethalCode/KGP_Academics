<TITLE> Hamas kills Qaeda allies in Gaza battle, 22 dead </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 GAZA, Aug 15, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The leader of a Palestinian Islamist splinter group allied to al Qaeda was among 22 people killed when forces from the Gaza Strip's ruling Hamas movement stormed its strongholds around a mosque, Hamas said on Saturday. Local civil rights monitors put the death toll at 28, with some 100 people wounded in Rafah, on the Egyptian border. In the worst inter-Palestinian violence in two years, 6 Hamas policemen and 6 civilians were among the dead. It exposed bitter tensions in the blockaded coastal strip, where Hamas has imposed its own nationalist brand of Islam while also trying to reach out to the West to end its international isolation. Three children died, said Hamas officials who blamed the Jund Ansar Allah, or Warriors of God, and its al Qaeda-inspired leader Abdel-Latif Moussa for provoking the attack by declaring an "emirate," or strict Islamic rule, in a sermon on Friday. The death of a Syrian fighter also challenged denials by Hamas leaders that foreign al Qaeda operatives were in Gaza. Moussa, a middle-aged physician and local cleric, and an aide named Khaled Banat, a Syrian national of Palestinian origin, blew themselves up after killing a negotiator, the officials said. Residents in the town of Rafah, still sealed off to the media by Hamas forces, described a night of terrifying violence. Hamas has ruled Gaza since routing the forces of Western-backed President Mahmoud Abbas in 2007. The bloodiest internal fighting since then has exposed challenges to Hamas on its radical, pan-Arab Islamist flank as the nationalist movement strives for international acceptance and an easing of an Israeli embargo that has prevented reconstruction since Israel's offensive in Gaza in January. Among the dead of Moussa's Jund Ansar Allah (Warriors of God) were former Hamas fighters, Rafah residents said, including Abdullah Abu Jazr, who was once a local commander for Hamas. Police detained dozens of suspected followers of Moussa, who used the al Qaeda-style nom de guerre Abu al-Nour al-Maqdessi and who accused Hamas of failing to impose strict Islamic codes. "SYRIAN" FIGHTER "We hold Jund Ansar Allah and Moussa responsible for what happened because of his rash declaration of an emirate," Taher al-Nono, a spokesman for the government of Gaza's Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, told a news conference overnight. Haniyeh on Friday had described reports of a foreign al Qaeda presence in Gaza as Israeli smears on Hamas's governance. Locals in Rafah said Moussa's lieutenant Banat, also known as Abu Abdullah al-Muhajir, was from Syria. A Hamas official said he had a Syrian passport but was of Palestinian origin. The group is not the first such manifestation of declared al Qaeda sympathies in Gaza since the Hamas takeover, though all such groups share the difficulties of the other 1.5 million Gazans in making physical contact with the outside world. The Warriors of God first made their presence known with a border raid against an Israeli base in June when some of its fighters rode into battle on horseback. Three were killed. Hamas Interior Ministry spokesman Ehab al-Ghsain said the group was behind bombings of Internet cafes and of a wedding party. Palestinian political analyst Hani Habib saw a twofold motive for the crackdown: "Hamas's message to the Palestinians is that the group is the sole ruler of Gaza," he said. But he added: "I think its main aim was to send a message to the West that it can suppress and abort any possible advance for the more radical groups. Hamas wanted to say that it is an Islamist faction but a moderate one." The United States and European Union shun Hamas, which won the 2006 Palestinian parliamentary election, for its refusal to end violence and accept Israel's existence. Western powers are also calling on Israel, however, to ease the blockade and have been urging Hamas to meet conditions to engage in peace talks. Maha Azzam of Chatham House in London said Gaza was not becoming a new international base for al Qaeda: "What has happened in Gaza in recent months, the Israeli invasion and the economic situation, has meant a renewed extremism at the fringes ... It doesn't mean an expansion of al Qaeda into Gaza." Israel unilaterally ended its occupation of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and withdrew its forces and settlers. However, it retains control of Gaza's borders, in cooperation with Eg
