 LONDON, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Uncapped batsman Jonathan Trott will make his England debut in the Ashes decider against Australia, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said on Sunday. The ECB also included all rounder Andrew Flintoff in a 14-man squad for the match, which starts at The Oval on Thursday, but Essex batsman Ravi Bopara has been left out after struggling with throughout the series. Monty Panesar, who was left out of the squad for the fourth Test at Headingley, returns to bolster England's spin options alongside Graeme Swann. Australia won that Test convincingly to level the series at 1-1. "Ravi's omission means Jonathan Trott will make his Test debut at The Oval," the ECB's National Selector Geoff Miller said in a statement. "Having been part of the squad at Headingley, he was the next batsman in line in our view and this rewards him for the excellent form he has shown in county cricket both this summer and with England Lions over the winter." Miller said Bopara's absence was a reflection of his batting struggles. Bopara was bowled first ball in the second innings at Headingley and his top score in the series was 35, in the first innings of the drawn first Test. "Ravi Bopara has been going through a tough time with the bat in this series and we have decided to leave him out of the squad for this game. "He will be extremely disappointed but remains very much part of our plans for the future and I am sure that he has the talent and temperament to regain his place in the side." FLINTOFF TO RETURN Flintoff, who bowled England to victory at Lord's in the second Test, has been struggling with a knee injury and missed the Headingly defeat. However, Miller was confident Flintoff would be fit for what will be his last Test match having announced his retirement from the five-day format. "Andrew Flintoff and James Anderson's injuries are much improved with rest and treatment and we anticipate that both players will be fit and available for selection next Thursday," Miller said. South Africa-born Trott, 28, has scored more than 1,000 runs for Warwickshire this season in the county championship, averaging 92. He is expected to bat at number four after Miller confirmed that his Warwickshire team mate Ian Bell would move up the order to number three. "Ian Bell will bat at three next week, which is a position he has occupied for England before, and we were delighted to see both him and Jonathan make centuries for Warwickshire this week," Miller said. Squad: Andrew Strauss (captain), James Anderson, Ian Bell, Stuart Broad, Paul Collingwood, Alastair Cook, Andrew Flintoff, Stephen Harmison, Graham Onions, Monty Panesar, Matt Prior, Ryan Sidebottom, Graeme Swann, Jonathan T
