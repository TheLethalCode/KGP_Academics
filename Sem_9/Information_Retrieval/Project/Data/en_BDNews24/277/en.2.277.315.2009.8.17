 BERLIN, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - After Usain Bolt rocked the athletics world on Sunday by smashing his own 100 metres record, the women will have their turn in the 100m at the world athletics championships on Monday.

Jamaican Olympic silver medallist Kerron Stewart set the pace in Sunday's qualifying, clocking 10.92 seconds with American champion Carmelita Jeter just behind.
