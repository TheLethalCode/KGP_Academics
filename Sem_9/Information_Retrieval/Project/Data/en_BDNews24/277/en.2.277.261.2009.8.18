 Chandpur, August 18 (bdnews24.com)Foreign minister Dipu Moni on Tuesday reiterated the government's pledge to repatriate the fugitive killers of independence architect Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and bring them to justice on Bangladeshi soil She said the government was working through different extradition treaties and bi-lateral talks. "We have extradition treaties with many countries," Dipu Moni said while distributing corrugated-iron sheeting to businessmen in Rampur Kamranga Bazar in Chandpur, after 25 shops in the market were gutted by fire in May. "There are countries with which we do not have treaties, but we are still trying to retrieve the murderers through bilateral talks with them," said Moni. Moni said the people of Bangladesh expected the Bangabandhu murder trial to be completed as soon as possible. "Anti-liberation forces formulated and enacted the indemnity ordnance to stop trial of the Bangabandhu murder case. But they failed in their evil design," she said. bdnews
