 Dhaka, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh rode on Musfiqur Rahim's brilliant half-century to post a five-wicket victory over Zimbabwe in the fifth and final match of the GrameenPhone Cup at the Queen Sports Club in Bulawayo on Tuesday. Mushfiq, who was promoted up the order, was eventually stumped for 98 in the 45th over as the Tigers reached 212 in 47.5 overs. His 121-ball knock featured 11 fours. Bangladesh, who already clinched the series with a four-wicket victory in the fourth match on Sunday, hunted down the target by way of partnerships: 43 for the opening wicket, 51 for the third and 70 for the fourth. The result meant Shakib Al Hasan's men walked away with the trophy with a 4-1 scoreline. Bangladesh won the first two games by eight wickets and 49 runs and lost the third match by 69 runs. Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan made 30, Mahmudullah Riyad 27 not out and Raqibul Hasan 24. Ray Price took two wickets. Chasing 210, the Tigers had lost quick wickets after a cautious start. Mohammad Ashraful (4) was caught at point off Elton Chigumbura with the score on 48 and an out of sorts Tamim Iqbal, adjudged Man of the Series, was bowled by Ray Price for four with the score on 43. Earlier, Zimbabwe, who won the toss, were all out for 209 in 46.4 overs. The home side made a disastrous start losing six wickets inside the first 15 overs. Only Brendan Taylor (61), Ray Price (46) and Hamilton Masakadza (25) troubled the scorers. Dolar Mahmud grabbed 4-28 to win the Man-of-the-Match award, Syed Rasel 2-45 while Mehrab Hossain Jr, Mahmudullah Riyad and Naeem Islam took one wicket
