<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com)State minister for home Shamsul Haque Tuku said on Sunday that law enforcing agencies, including Rapid Action Battalion, would be working in unison with the ministries to control the price of essentials during Ramadan this year. "The government is determined to control prices during Ramadan. Law enforcers will work in unison with concerned ministries, including the commerce ministry to achieve that," Tuku told reporters after a meeting with RAB officials at the battalion's headquarters in the city. Tuku also called on journalists to root out information on dishonest 'syndicates' operating in the wholesale and retail markets of the country to end the annual price hikes. Turning to the issue of reported extrajudicial killings at the hands of RAB and other law enforcers, Tuku said it was the state's responsibility to ensure the public's personal security and property. "Steps will be taken after investigation," he said referring to reported cases of deaths by 'crossfire' in different parts of the country. bdne
