 Kurigram, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com)  Thirty people sustained injuries, half of them "critical", in clashes sparked by a family feud over 32 bighas of land in a Kurigram village on Saturday, police said. "A family dispute has been going on for 17 years in Kachirchar village over this substantial portion of land," officer-in-charge of Kurigram Sadar police Humayun Kabir told bdnews24.com. Kabir said the failure of a brother and sister to reach a compromise over the land of their late father Kachhadi Mahmood culminated in violence on Saturday. "The clashes occurred as two groups, led by the brother Israil and sister Kamlabhan, went to take possession of the land at around 11am." Police, on duty in the town area to ensure security for local National Mourning Day programmes, reached Kachirchar after being informed of the riot, and of "critically injured" people being taken to hospital. They managed to bring the situation under control around 12.30pm, said Kabir. Fifteen people. 11 men and four women ranging from 16 to 60 years old, were admitted to Kurigram Sadar Hospital, he said. The others received first aid. Both groups lodged cases with police, said the local police chief. "We are trying to arrest all those responsible for the violence. We are drawing up a list of names," said Kabir. Police have been patrolling the disputed land to prevent any further violence, he added. bdn
