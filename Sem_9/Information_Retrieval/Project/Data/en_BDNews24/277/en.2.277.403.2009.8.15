 Dhaka, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com)Applicants to the posts of police sub-inspector and sergeant, who had their selection process terminated when the caretaker government assumed power, asked for the prime minister's assistance on Saturday to take up their positions. In Feb 2007, some 757 candidates for the positions had their appointment procedures cancelled on the orders of the inspector general of police following allegations of corruption and irregularities in their selection process. Ashraful Alam, a spokesman for the group, told bdnews24.com at a demonstration at the Shaheed Minar on Saturday that they had postponed a "mass self immolation" after hearing some high-ups were considering their position. Some of the group have been admitted to hospital since launching an indefinite hunger strike on Aug 2, said Alam. "We have been calling attention to our plight for a long time, and we are now becoming too old to pursue other jobs," he said. "We will face a dire situation if the prime minister does not support us." The group took their police exams in Nov 2005 and by Jan 2007 their police background checks had been completed, before the interim government cancelled their applications. bd
