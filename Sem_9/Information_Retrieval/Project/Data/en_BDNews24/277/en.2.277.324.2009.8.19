<TITLE> Rice seeds for coastal lands by this year: Motia </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com)Agriculture minister Motia Chowdhury has said her government is eager enough to revise the agriculture policy and stressed developing agriculture in the neglected areas in the coastal and drought-prone regions. She called for public-private partnership to develop rice production, specially to produce quality seed in one billion hectares of coastal lands where salinity and flooding have been the threats to rice production. The government cannot develop the seed production only with its own experts and resources, she said and asked private organisations to come up with modern technology. "We'll assist them with our best efforts," Motia said at a workshop on 'Developing PPP for Enhancing Production and Adoption of Stress Tolerant Rice in Coastal Regions". "Thus we can ensure increased rice production in a short time which will lead to food autarky." SouthAsia Enterprise Development Facility (SEDF) organised the workshop at Dhaka Westin Hotel on Wednesday. The minister spoke about the urgency to introduce a variety of seed for the coastal land, and develop more varieties. Recently, a parent variety, salinity and submergence tolerant seed, Swarna sub1, has been collected from India and is under development to produce a suitable one for Bangladesh's condition by the scientists of Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI) and International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). Experts are hopeful about its success by this year. The minister said a rice seed brought from Uganda will be sown in the drought-prone areas. She also asked for collaboration of the local government and Water Development Board (WDB) to assist the development process. Anwar Faruque, director general of seed wing under the agriculture ministry, urged for strengthening the efficiency of the private sector in the maintenance of quality seeds since the production and distribution of quality seeds in the public sector are insufficient. He said the private sector will be encouraged to popularise hybrid seed production and marketing as the sector has not yet got the necessary support. The National Agriculture Policy will be revised to establish a self-reliant and sustainable agriculture adaptive to climate change and responsive to farmers' needs, he added. The draft policy, submitted to the ministry, will try to ensure food security by increasing production, particularly cereal crops, with a special focus on reaching quality seeds to farmers at a reasonable price. The government will support research on emerging issues like biotechnology, hybrid climate change, disaster and stress including flood, drought, salinity, submergence, upland or hill and deep-water crop management and organic farming to further improve the farming sector. Faruque emphasised seed production through molecular breeding methods which cuts production time and ensures more crops. Later, discussants from local and South-Asian research institutes, donor agencies and representatives from private seed producers participated the day-long session.
