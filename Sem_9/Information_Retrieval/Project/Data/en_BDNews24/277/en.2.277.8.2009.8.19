<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court will hear on Aug 25 the president's reference seeking a directive on the BDR mutiny trial, the attorney general said on Wednesday. The full bench of the Appellate Division headed by chief justice MM Ruhul Amin set the date at around 9:45am. Mahbubey Alam told bdnews24.com that the court had set the hearing on the reference on Aug 25. It would also appoint amici curiae (friends of the court) by the midday for the hearing, he said. Alam said: "I applied for the hearing to be held during the vacation. The court has set the date before the vacation attaching importance to the matter." The court will go on one month's vacation from Sept 1. The attorney general in the hearing said amici curiae should be appointed for reference hearing and given 10 days to prepare for the hearing. As the issue is urgent the hearing should be held soon, he said. The Supreme Court can hold the hearing at the beginning of the vacation, Alam added. The court said: "The amici curiae might not be available during the vacation. In addition, some of our judges might go on vacation. But we are ready." Alam said: "If any amicus curiae cannot appear in the court I can request him/her to give written statement and can submit that to the court." The court then set the hearing date on Aug 25 for the convenience of the amici curiae. When Alam asked the court about the names of the amici curiae, he was told that the name of the amici curiae will be set today. Their appointment will be informed by the Supreme Court registrar. The president sent a reference to the chief justice on Monday seeking a directive on whether the accused in the BDR mutiny case could be tried under military law, specifically the Army Act of 1952. "The reference asks to know if there is any bar to trying the BDR mutineers under the Army Act," SC registrar Md Shawkat Hossain told bdnews24.com on Monday. "It asks what the process would be and whether a notice would suffice according to Section 5 of the Army Act to try the mutineers under military law." An inter-ministerial meeting on the BDR trial decided last month that the president would seek the chief justice's opinion on the BDR trial process as opinions varied widely on whether the accused mutineers should be tried under military or civil law. Over seventy people were killed in the Feb 25-26 massacre, of whom 57 were army officers, the rest of the victims were BDR members and civilian bystanders. The national probe body on the BDR mutiny, in its report submitted to the government in May, recommended trying the mutineers under the Army Act for fast trial. There were also suggestions from some quarters to try the accused under a specially formed tribunal. But in face of concerns aired by BDR families and rights groups over whether a fair and open trial could be held under military law or special tribunal, the government formed an inter-ministerial committee to "look at all aspects" before deciding on the trial process. The government has said the trial of those responsible for the BDR massacre will be conducted according to the constitution and existing laws, either under the BDR Act, the Army Act or civilian laws. But law minister Shafique Ahmed has said "complexities remain on some issues". According to Section 106 of the Constitution, the president can seek an opinion from the Supreme Court on any matter of law or public importance. On July 4, 1995, the then president Abdur Rahman Biswas had sent a reference to the Supreme Court to seek its opinion on whether a parliamentarian absent from parliament for over 90 days stands liable to lose his seat. bdne
