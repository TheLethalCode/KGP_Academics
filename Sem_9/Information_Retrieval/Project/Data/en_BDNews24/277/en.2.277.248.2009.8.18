 Dhaka, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com)The International Chittagong Hill Tracts Commission on Tuesday recommended fully empowering the CHT Land Commission to return disputed land in the long troubled hill region to its original owners. "We talked with a broad section of people, especially the indigenous population, but also with people rehabilitated there, the army and local administrations," Lord Eric Avebury, member of the British House of Lords and one of the commission's three vice-chairpersons, told a press briefing at the National Press Club. "After the talks, we learnt that quick solutions are required to resolve disputes over land ownership," Avebury said, on his return from a three-day tour of the CHT. The Land Commission was originally formed in 2001 line with the 1997 Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord, but never gained traction due lack of funds, manpower and political will. It convened for the first time on Aug 4 this year, eight years after its inception. The sensitive region has been troubled by violence and counter-violence between the indigenous population and Bengali settlers since the 1970s. Avebury said security in the CHT region would not be jeopardised by withdrawal of the temporary military camps. The international commission also called on the government to hold simultaneous elections for the Chittagong Hill Tracts Regional Council and three district councils. The commission was formed in Copenhagen in the 1990s to create pressure on the then Bangladesh government to stop alleged human rights violations in the hill region. Co-chairpersons of the international commission , Ida Nicolson and Sultana Kamal, also attended the press conference. They lauded the recent formation of a national committee on implementing the CHT peace accord, re-constitution of the Land Commission and a taskforce on the rehabilitation of CHT refugees, as well as cancellation of leases given in the name of afforestation. The international commission hoped the government would set up a database of demands related to ownership of disputed lands. It also welcomed the recent withdrawal of makeshift army camps from the region. The press conference was told that the commission believed most people of the CHT region would live in peace and amity with each other extending all hands in realising the accord. Members of the commission met prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Monday, who said the withdrawal of a whole brigade, out of five deployed in the region, was part of the peace process and assured them of implementing the CHT accord in a transparent and positive way. bdne
