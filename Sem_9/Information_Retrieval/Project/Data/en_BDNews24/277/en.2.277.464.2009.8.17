<TITLE> Campaign closes as Karzai seeks warlord edge </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KABUL, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan leader Hamid Karzai's main rival drew a chaotic crowd of thousands on Monday, the final day of campaigning before presidential elections, with the poll's outcome hanging on the threat of violence and the clout of old warlords. Security guards for Abdullah Abdullah, Karzai's former foreign minister, beat back enthusiastic supporters with rifle butts at the rally in Kabul's National Olympic Stadium, notoriously once used by the Taliban as an execution ground. Several thousand supporters waved blue flags and cheered as Abdullah gave a passionate address, whipping some in the crowd into a frenzy. A makeshift platform used by television journalists collapsed in the crush, lightly injuring several. Many supporters stampeded through gates and shattered glass doors to get closer to Abdullah, an urbane eye doctor, while others clung precariously to a light tower. Abdullah's frenetic rally came a day after a former Uzbek militia leader, General Abdul Rashid Dostum, jetted back into Afghanistan from exile in Turkey, perhaps to deliver enough support to swing the election for Karzai in a single round. Polls have shown Karzai firmly in the lead with about 45 percent of the vote, but not by enough to win an outright majority and avoid a run-off against Abdullah, who has strong support among ethnic Tajiks in the north of the country. The prospect of violence could hurt Karzai's first-round chances. Taliban militants have vowed to disrupt the poll, which could hurt voter turn-out, especially in the Pashtun south which has overwhelmingly supported Karzai, a Pashtun, in the past. ALARM While Karzai has focused on quiet coalition building, Abdullah's campaign has built surprisingly strong momentum on the strength of popular rallies like the one in Kabul on Monday. Abdullah, once closely allied to enigmatic Tajik guerrilla leader Ahmad Shah Masood, was also due to address followers in the violent southeastern province of Paktia later on Monday. Karzai has secured the endorsements of ethnic chieftains and former militia bosses, but that tactic has raised the alarm of Western donors fearful of a return to power by warlords whose factional fighting in the 1990s tore the country apart. Few of the former militia chiefs are viewed with more suspicion by the West than Dostum, a whisky-drinking ex-Communist general whose militia repeatedly changed sides during the civil war. Dostum won 10 percent of the vote during the last election in 2004, and his support could tip the balance for Karzai. "We love him like our father. He is our elder and anything he says, I'll accept," said Daoud, an 18-year-old working in a juice shop in northern Sheberghan. Dostum arrived in Kabul late on Sunday shortly after the government announced that he was free to return. The United Nations and the United States both expressed concern at the prospect that Dostum could return to a position in government in exchange for delivering votes to Karzai. Aleem Siddique, a U.N. spokesman in Kabul, said Afghanistan "needs more competent politicians and fewer warlords". A U.S. official said Washington had made its "serious concerns" about a future role for Dostum clear to the Afghan government and said Dostum's reputation "raised questions of his culpability for massive human rights violations". Karzai also boosted his chances last week by securing the last-minute endorsement of Ismail Khan, a regional potentate with strong influence in the important western city of Herat. His two vice presidential running mates are former guerrilla chiefs from the Tajik and Hazara minorities, and he has also secured support of ex-guerrillas from his own Pashtun group. Abdullah has been seeking to broaden his appeal and polls show him with about 25 percent of the vote, enough to make him the near-certain challenger in a run-off in October should Karzai fail to win in the first round. The election is a test for U.S. President Barack Obama's strategy of escalating the 8-year-old war in an effort to turn the tide after Taliban advances in recent years. More than 30,000 extra U.S. troops have arrived in Afghanistan this year, raising the number of Western troops above 100,000 for the first time, including more than 62,000 Americans. U.S. and British troops have launched major offensives, taking unprecedented casualties -- more Western troops have died in Afghanistan since March than in the entire period from 2001-2004. A bomb killed three more British soldiers on Sunday.
