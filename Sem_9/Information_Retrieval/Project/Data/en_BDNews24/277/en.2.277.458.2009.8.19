 Dhaka, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com)Top officials of concerned ministries will meet on Thursday to chalk out a strategy to deal with the sharp increase in reported cases of swine flu in the country, the health minister said. "The inter-ministerial meeting will determine the plan of action after considering the latest information on swine flu," Dr Mahmudur Rahman, director of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), told bdnews24.com. Health minister AFM Ruhul Haq will brief reporters after the meeting, a notice from the ministry said on Wednesday. According to the latest IEDCR figures, announced Tuesday, the number of confirmed H1N1 cases more than doubled to seventy-six since the last count of 37 on Aug 15. Dr Rahman said no further cases were confirmed in Bangladesh since Tuesday. The health minister said on Sunday the regional rise in reported cases of the H1N1 virus was "alarming" for Bangladesh, although the country was prepared to deal with the situation. Haq told reporters that sufficient stocks of flu drugs were in place and doctors were receiving specialised training on a rolling basis throughout the country, with treatment facilities ready at every district-level hospital in the country. Meanwhile in neighbouring India, over 2,200 people have tested positive for the H1N1 virus to date, with 28 reported fatalities, an Indian ministry of health and family welfare update said on Wednesday. Screening measures were recently beefed-up at Bangladesh's 11 land ports in a bid to check entry of the flu virus. Symptoms of the virus include fever with high temperature and respiratory problems. Bangladesh authorities advise schools and offices to grant leave to anyone who displays symptoms of the flu. Health officials also advise people to refrain from spitting and to wash their hands regularly to curb the spread of the flu virus. bd
