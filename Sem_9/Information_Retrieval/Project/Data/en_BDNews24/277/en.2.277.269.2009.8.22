 Chittagong, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com)  The deputation of navy officers to the top posts of Chittagong Port Authority, leaving skilled and experienced civilian officials behind, is leading to growing frustration and dissatisfaction among the officials. CPA officials say unplanned and uncoordinated appointments have created vacancies in several key administrative and technical positions, which has left the port with insufficient skilled and experienced manpower. Port chairman, Commodore RU Ahmed, has himself voiced disapproval of the appointments from the navy in a specialised institution like the port. He also admitted regular officials were being deprived of promotion due to deputation of naval officers. Ahmed told bdnews24.com on Friday, "Experienced officials should be given appointments in the vital technical positions, and as members and directors, for the port to function in a proper coordinated way." "There have been unplanned appointments in the past which created many vacancies at a time and left experienced officials without promotions," he said. Currently, navy officers occupy two of the four CPA member posts. One of the others is filled by an acting member, while the fourth member post is still vacant. Three out of four CPA directors have also been appointed from the navy. Moreover, two navy officers are acting as chief engineer and planner of the port, and seven navy men have also been appointed in other key posts such as chief hydrographer. CPA officials, not wanting to be named, have told bdnews24.com regular officials losing out on promotions, due to the deputations from the navy, has left a negative impression among them. They said it was inconsistent with the existing policy of the government. CPA chairman Ahmed, who has held the top post for 13 months on deputation from the navy, said, "The government nominates the candidates for the chairman and four member positions; everyone accepts the chairman as it is a figurative post." "But the functioning of the port would be easier if the member positions were filled from senior CPA officials with the proper skills and experience," said Ahmed. bdn
