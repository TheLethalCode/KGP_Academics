 Sunamganj, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com)Water levels of the Surma and Teesta rivers, in the north, have risen above danger levels after prolonged rainfall in upstream areas inundated lands, leading to fears of more widespread flooding. The Surma in Sunamganj rose on Monday spilling over low-lying regions of Doarabazar upazila,. Sunamganj Water Development Board executive-engineer, Abdul Hakim, said water levels at Shologhar point were now flowing 34cm above the danger mark. "If water levels continue to rise, there will be widespread flooding," said Hakim, who added that the Nabinagar area of the district had already been partially flooded. Water levels of the Teesta River were flowing an average of 15 cm over the red mark, while 22 other rivers in northern districts were also recorded above danger levels. Large tracts of lands in Nilphamari district have gone under water after non-stop rainfall over the last four days, the local bdnews24.com correspondent reports. Homesteads in Nilphamari Sadar, Domar, Dimla, Jaldhaka, Kishoreganj and Syedpur upazilas have been inundated following a record 513mm of rainfall over the last four days, say officials. The unrelenting rain has left other rural communities totally isolated due to the condition of muddy unpaved roads. Floodwater has also entered hundreds of low-lying homes in Niphamari district town, said local authorities. Fish stocks have been lost from many ponds in the area, while Aman rice planted on around 50,000 acres of land have been partially submerged. Farmers are also facing difficulties in locating fodder for their livestock. bdnew
