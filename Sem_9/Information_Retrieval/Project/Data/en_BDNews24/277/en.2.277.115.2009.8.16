 Dhaka, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com)  BNP leader Salauddin Quader Chowdhury could be charged with sedition, for his comments on the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the state minister for home said on Saturday. State minister Shamsul Haque Tuku said a case should be filed following Chowdhury's comments earlier in the week that "August 15 1975 was inevitable just like 1/11 in 2007", referring to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's assassination in a 1975 military coup and comparing it to the January 11 2007 'changeover' to a military-backed caretaker regime during pre-polls political turmoil. He was speaking at a National Mourning Day programme, marking the 34th death anniversary of Sheikh Mujib and his family, held by Pabna district Awami League and local administration at Doyel Centre in the town. He also linked the sensational ten-truck arms case in Chittagong to Jamaat-e-Islami chief Matiur Rahman Nizami and BNP leader Salauddin Quader Chowdhury. "The grenades that had been smuggled into the country with the ten-truck arms consignment was used to attack prime minister Sheikh Hasina's rally in 2004," Tuku said. As the 2004 ten-truck arms case and Aug 21 2004 grenade attack case have been revived, a conspiracy against her has begun again," said the state minister. Tuku later led a mourning procession through the town and launched a blood donation drive organised by Red Crescent Society. State minister for law Quamrul Islam, in a separate statement on Saturday, also said Chowdhury should be "brought to justice" for his derogatory comments about the killing of Sheikh Mujib. He was speaking to the media after distributing food among the poor in front of the Awami League central office at Bangabandhu Avenue as part of the party's mourning day programmes. bd
