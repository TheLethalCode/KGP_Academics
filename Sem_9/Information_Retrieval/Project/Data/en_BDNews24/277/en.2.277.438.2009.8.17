 TAIPEI, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A strong earthquake rattled Taiwan and southern Japanese islands on Monday but there were no immediate reports of casualties or damage. The epicentre of the quake, which struck at 8:05 a.m. (0005 GMT), was about 188 km (116 miles) southeast of Hualien on Taiwan's east coast at a depth of 11 km (7 miles), the island's Central Weather Bureau said in a statement. The US Geological Survey put the magnitude at 6.7 after a first estimation of 6.9. Japan withdrew an earlier tsunami warning. Earthquakes occur frequently in Taiwan, which lies to the southeast of China on a seismically active stretch of the Pacific basin. Taiwan is recovering from a typhoon that struck on Aug 8, causing widespread mudslides and flooding. President Ma Ying-jeou has estimated the eventual death toll from the storm at more than 500. One of Taiwan's worst-recorded quakes occurred in September 1999. Measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale, it killed more than 2,400 people and destroyed or damaged 50,000 buildings
