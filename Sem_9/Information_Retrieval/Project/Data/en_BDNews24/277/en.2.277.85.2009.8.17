 Dhaka, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com)  Shane Warne has called for the end of one-day cricket, saying that the 50-over format has "passed its sell-by date". He is of the opinion that teams should play only Test and Twenty20 cricket with a World Twenty20 being held every two years. "This is a big call, but cricket evolves and the 50-over game has passed its sell-by date," Warne wrote in his column for the Times, according to Cricinfo on Monday.

England are having to move away from early-May Tests because they are struggling to find opponents during a clash of dates with IPL. A gap of a month or six weeks fixed in the calendar would ease all potential problems and keep the players happy." Warne also criticised the present standard of umpiring in international cricket, saying it was "as low as I've known it in 20 years". "Yes, it is a difficult job and technology exposes any mistakes, but some of the performances in the Ashes series so far have been pretty ordinary," he wrote. "Players will accept that the odd bad decision gets through now and again. At the moment, there are just too many." He also felt that the remuneration umpires currently receive should be revised upwards to "reflect the importance of the
