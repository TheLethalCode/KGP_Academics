<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 16 (bdnews24.com)Former national assembly speaker barrister Jamiruddin Sircar filed a petition with the High Court Sunday seeking to challenge the legality of convening a parliamentary committee for probing graft allegations against him, its activities and recommendations. Sircar's lawyer Rafiqul Islam Miah told bdnews24.com the petition was submitted to the HC bench of Justices Tariq-Ul Hakim and Borhan Uddin, seeking an injunction on the committee's report and subsequent actions against Sircar based on it. "They may hear the petition today (Sunday)," said the lawyer. The 11-member parliamentary committee, headed by advocate Fazle Rabbi MP, submitted its report on July 5, recommending cancelling the former speaker's seat and taking legal measures against him for misappropriation of parliament secretariat funds and other offences during his tenure from 2001-08. The incumbent speaker advocate Abdul Hamid convened the parliamentary committee on March 22, acting on calls by sitting MPs, to investigate the graft charges brought against Jamir Uddin Sircar. The petition claims that the parliamentary committee had not been constituted following parliamentary rules of business. It also demanded that the constitution of the committee, its report and recommendations be declared illegal. bdnews
