 Cox's Bazar, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com)At least 20 people sustained injuries in armed clashes over a shrimp enclosure on Moheshkhali Island in Cox's Bazar on Saturday, just days after a gun running operation was busted for supplying firearms to local pirates and land grabbers. Law enforcers arrested a man and recovered three home-made guns and six cartridge shells from the scene of the violence at Narbila on Saturday, said officer-in-charge of Moheskhkhali police Swapan Kumar Nath. "We had sensed a possible clash between two groups over the shrimp enclosure 'Chhara Ghona'," said Nath. Police ejected the two groups from the area, and assigned Ansar members to oversee the enclosure, he said. "But after police left the spot, the two groups returned and engaged in armed clashes. At least two of them from rival groups sustained critical injuries," Nath said. "Police have now been deployed at the spot. Cases are also underway." Rapid Action Battalion, just two days before, on Thursday, raided a makeshift 'munitions factory' on the remote Moheskhkhali island, arresting three men with enough gun-manufacturing equipment for 50 firearms, RAB officials said. RAB officials said gangs who grabbed shrimp enclosures and pirates, who kidnapped fisherman and robbed trawlers in the Bay of Bengal, would have been the main buyers of the arms. bdn
