<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 16 (bdnews24.com)The president will send a reference on Monday to the Supreme Court seeking opinion on which law the Bangladesh Rifles mutineers should be tried, the state minister for law said on Sunday. An inter-ministerial meeting on the BDR trial had decided last month that the president would seek the chief justice's opinion before deciding as opinions varied on whether the trials should be held under military law or criminal law. The law minister Shafique Ahmed had said last week a reference would be forwarded by the president to the chief justice this week. Qamrul Islam, state minister for law and parliamentary affairs, told reporters Sunday that it would likely be sent on Monday. Monday will also see Durbar Hall hold its first BDR gathering since the bloody events of last February, the border force chief director general said earlier. "It will be the first organisational activity at the hall since the mutiny," BDR chief Maj Gen Moinul Islam told bdnews24.com. Dhaka BDR personnel have held one durbar since the mutiny, on the parade ground of the border force's Peelkhana headquarters, said Gen Moinul. But, he said, this will be the first meeting in Durbar Hall itself since Feb 26, when the force's annual durbar ended with a massacre of officers who were assembled at the hall, including Gen Moinul's predecessor, BDR chief Maj Gen Shakil Ahmed. Over seventy people were killed in the Feb 26-28 massacre, of whom 57 were army officers, the rest of the victims were BDR members and civilian bystanders. bdne
