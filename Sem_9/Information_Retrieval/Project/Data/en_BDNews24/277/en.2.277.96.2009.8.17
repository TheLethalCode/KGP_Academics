 Bagerhat, August 17 (bdnews24.com)Over 1,000 former workers, retrenched from Mongla Port due to new labour laws in 2008, began a non-stop sit-in protest Monday morning demanding the reintroduction of the call station booking system and payment of arrears. Members of the Mongla Port Shipping Workers Association began their protest programme at 6am at the port's Call Station Square. MPSWA president Shamsul Alam said the protesters would continue with the peaceful sit-in process till their demands are met. Some 1,100 ex-workers, including 47 assistant supervisors, 138 paper workers, 52 cargo inspectors, 45 tally checkers, 49 deck foremen, 546 tally clerks and 239 hatch foremen, joined the sit-in. The demonstrators were all formerly employed at the port through the Stevedores Association. As the Labour (Amendment) Ordinance 2008 was enforced on August 1, 2008, the Mongla Port Dock Workers Board of Directors and the Stevedores Association call station booking system were abolished, causing 1,016 workers to lose jobs. The rally there was addressed by MPSWA vice president Faridul Alam Majumder, general secretary Ashok K Barhoi and the association's founder GS Abu Bakkar Molla, among others. The movement's leaders told bdnews24.com earlier that they had informed the port's authority and Association in writing about their planned action. Alam said they were pressing for reintroduction of the call booking system and dues of at least Tk 8,800,000 owed them by the Stevedores Association that had employed them in the past. They also demanded payment of due death allowances, payment of 'golden handshakes' promised to 741 workers in 2005, and payment of arrears in wages as per conditions laid down in an earlier agreement. He said at least 50 workers had died since 2007 who were members of their union, and whose entitled allowances to families were yet to be paid. Mongla Port Stevedores Association general secretary, Abdullah Mohammad Khokan, said his association is aware of the demands, "but they'll need time to be met." Mongla Port Authority chairman Commodore M Faruque said workers who had lost their jobs had no direct relationship with the port. The issue of the retrenched workers is the stevedores' problem, "and no one else's", he said. "The port has no ship anchored at the moment, so there's no work there anyway," he added. Mongla police chief, Kazi Zalal Uddin Ahmed, said they were keeping an eye on the situation. bdnew
