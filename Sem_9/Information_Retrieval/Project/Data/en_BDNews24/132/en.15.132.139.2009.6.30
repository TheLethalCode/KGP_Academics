 MILAN, June 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Italy captain Paolo Maldini turned down an offer to join Chelsea's backroom staff, new coach Carlo Ancelotti said on Tuesday. The 41-year-old defender, who retired at the end of last season, spoke to Ancelotti about following the former AC Milan coach from the San Siro to London. "It was a proposal I made to him but at the moment he wants to rest a bit," Ancelotti told Italian radio. Ancelotti, who has been linked in the media with bids for Milan duo Alexandre Pato and Andrea Pirlo, said Cristiano Ronaldo's world record $130 million move from Manchester United to Real Madrid had warped the transfer market. "Now the truth is the market is very complicated because the prices after the sale of Ronaldo to Real Madrid have all become a bit mad," he said.
