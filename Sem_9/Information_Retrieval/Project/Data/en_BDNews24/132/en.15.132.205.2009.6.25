 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, June 25 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary watchdog on Thursday formed a sub-committee to investigate corruption charges against former adviser to caretaker government Mainul Hosein. ABM Fazle Karim Chowdhury, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on housing and public works, said Hosein would be summoned to the sub-committee to give his version on public land allotted to his wife and sons. Nasrul Hamid MP will the head the all-party sub-committee. The other members are Asaduzzaman Khan, Jahirul Haque Bhuiyan Mohan and Enamul Haque and the BNP's Lutfar Rahman. Hosein is the second adviser to the immediate past caretaker government to have corruption charges investigated by parliament. The parliamentary standing committee on shipping has been investigating corruption charges against former shipping adviser MA Matin. Hosein, the executive director of Ittefaq Group of Publications, was heavily criticised for his 'anti-politics' statement made after the declaration of the state of emergency on January 11, 2007. "We have received written allegations that Mainul Hosein as adviser to the public works ministry abused his authority for personal gains," said Chowdhury. "So, we have formed the probe body to investigate the corruption," he told bdnews24.com after a meeting at the parliament building. The committee head, however, would not name those who made the allegations against Hosein. He said the probe committee had one month to report to the standing committee. "Mainul Hosein made a false declaration to conceal his Baridhara house saying he had no plots in Dhaka to get public land . "He allotted land to his wife Sajeda Hossain and his sons abusing his authority," said Chowdhury. The chairman said the former adviser used false name of his wife to get the land. The committee also discussed changing the name of the Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre. "The conference centre was named after Bangbandhu Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre as per the original agreement with China. "But the foreign ministry (in 2002) changed the name without consulting the housing and public works ministry, the owner of the centre," said Fazle Karim Chowdhury. "We may recommend a change in the name in the future and restore the old name Bangbandhu Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre," said the chairman. bd
