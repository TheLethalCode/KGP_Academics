 Dhaka, June 25 (bdnews24.com)The prosecution has filed an appeal for further probe into the murder and explosives cases over the Aug 21 grenade attack in 2004 on an Awami League rally. Chief state counsel Syed Rezaur Rahman filed the appeal with the special dock located at Nazimuddin Road on Thursday. Judge Md Masder Hossain of the First Speedy Trial Tribunal set July 1 for the hearing of the appeal. The proceedings of the two cases are running concurrently. Some 61 among 412 witnesses have so far testified. The witnesses include president Zillur Rahman, prime minister Sheikh Hasina, home minister Sahara Khatun and AL general secretary Abdul Jalil. At least 23 people were killed including party central leader Ivy Rahman and scores of people were injured in the deadly grenade attack on Bangabandhu Avenue. CID assistant police superintendent Fazlul Kabir pressed charges in the cases on June 11, 2008. The BNP-led four-party coalition government made an attempt to divert the case into a different stream by making fake accused, the investigators say. The CID in its charge sheet made 22 people accused in the case including former deputy minister Abdus Salam Pintu, his brother, also the alleged grenade supplier Maolana Tajuddin alias Taj, and banned Islamist outfit Harkatul Jihad leader Mufti Hannan. Of them 13 accused including Pintu and Mufti Hannan are now behind bars while the remaining accused are on the run. bdnews2
