 By M A Taslim Dhaka, June 29 (bdnews24.com)The finance minister has brought down his first budget amid the usual hype and pomp. It supposedly benefited from the copious suggestions emanating from numerous pre-budget dialogues and seminars. A veritable discussion storm is now raging in the media with sombre-faced pundits speculating on the 'ambitiousness' of the budget and the 'challenges' of its implementation. The issue of black money seems to be a hot favourite for moralising. The scripts written after any of the previous budgets could be regurgitated without anyone becoming suspicious. If there is one budget measure that the overwhelming majority of the ordinary people would strongly support, it must be the taxes on the so-called luxury items such as cars and air-conditioners. There is a perception that such items are consumed by the rich people. They should be penalised with punitive taxes for their splurge on goods that the ordinary people cannot afford. On a more technical note, taxes on luxury goods are usually defended on both equity and efficiency grounds. Since luxury goods are consumed by the relatively better-off people who have a greater capacity to bear the burden of taxes, it is only fair that the goods they consume should be taxed at a higher rate. This would ensure that the richer people pay more in taxes than the poorer people. Luxury goods, such as cars and air-conditioners, are mostly imported. The higher taxes on these goods reduce import payments by reducing their consumption. They may also encourage domestic production of these goods since the effective protection on them would be very high. Some of the luxury goods such as cars may cost the society more than they cost the individual due to negative externalities such as pollution, congestion etc. There is thus a divergence between the market price and the true social cost. High taxes on these goods help in reducing the divergence. It is a well-known law of economics that when the price of any good rises, the demand for it falls off. However, it is only the marginal consumers who reduce or forgo their consumption. Hence when taxes levied on luxury goods raise their prices, the first to cut consumption will be the marginal consumers. Intra-marginal consumers will keep up their consumption albeit at a higher cost. Who are likely to be the marginal consumers of a luxury good such as an air-conditioner or a car? Certainly they are not the rich people, but mostly the middle class people such as bank officers or teachers who have saved long and hard in order to afford the luxury of coolness on hot summer days or safe and timely commuting to office and school. The higher taxes push them out of the market. They will have to save harder and longer if they still wish to purchase these goods. Being excluded from the market, they apparently do not bear any burden of the taxes; but in reality they are dealt with most harshly since they are deprived from consuming a desirable good. Most rich people are either business owners or top executives of business firms. They frequently buy luxury goods such as cars and air-conditioners on company accounts. So their private expenses on luxury goods are conveniently converted into company expenses which then translate into higher prices of the products their firms produce. To the extent these products are bought by the ordinary people they ultimately bear much of the burden of the taxes on the luxury goods. A large fraction of the luxury goods, such as cars and air-conditioners, are actually bought by government and semi-government organisations. The higher tax burden on these goods will obviously be borne by the government exchequer. Thus a large part of the revenue earned from the luxury taxes will be spent to pay for these taxes. Since higher taxes raise prices, the demand for taxed goods declines with higher taxes. As a result the tax base also declines. Indeed, the attenuation of the tax base could be of such a magnitude that the net taxes earned by the government after increasing the taxes could be less (or not much more) than what it had earned before the increase. In this case the normal revenue objective of taxation cannot be satisfied by raising taxes. Governments around the world employ various methods in the hope of extracting more tax revenue from the rich people; but the achievement in this regard is modest. The rich people frequently pay a much smaller proportion of their income in taxes than do the ordinary salary and wage earners. The incidence of even the luxury taxes sometimes falls, at least partly, on the ordinary people since the rich and powerful find ways to shift the burden of the taxes to the less fortunate. Hopefully the Finance Minister will be more successful in making the rich pay. Professor M. A. Taslim is currently the CEO of Bangladesh Foreign Trade Insti
