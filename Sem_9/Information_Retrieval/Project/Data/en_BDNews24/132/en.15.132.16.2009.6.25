<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 25 (bdnews24.com)The government is considering raising funds for the power sector by issuing bonds and offloading shares of state owned entities in the capital market, Toufique-e-Elahi Chowdhury, the prime minister's energy adviser, said Thursday. "The government's proposed public-private partnership initiatives should also attract investment at home and abroad," said Chowdhury at a seminar hosted by the Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies. Government-owned power generating companies and gas producers have already enlisted themselves in the capital market and we plan to issue bonds at home and abroad to raise more funds, he said. "Non-resident Bangladeshis will also be welcome to invest in these bonds," said Chowdhury. Former PetroBangla director Makbur-e-Elahi said Bangladesh would benefit enormously if probable deposits of between two to four trillion cubic feet of gas were better exploited. Chowdhury also announced a scheme to distribute 20,000 energy saving bulbs throughout the country from Feb 2010. bd
