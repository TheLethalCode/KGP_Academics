 Dhaka, June 28 (bdnews24.com)Deputy leader of the parliament Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury has led calls on MPs to repeal the caretaker government system, with Jatiya Party chairman H M Ershad getting on board. "I call on the members of house to cancel the system of caretaker government," Chowdhury said in her speech on the budget discussion on Sunday. "The caretaker government will not be needed if the Election Commission is strengthened." The ruling Awami League MP said the interim government provision was 'unconstitutional',: "They took the power in an unconstitutional way. National economy was destroyed. They tortured politicians, partisans, business people and masses from different walks of life," she said, referring to the 2007-08 military-installed caretaker government led by Fakhruddin Ahmed. "That government made the whole country a custody," Chowdhury said. Former president Ershad said the caretaker government was a shame for Bangladesh. "We want an end to the system of caretaker government. We want to be free from it. The system should be cancelled," said Ershad. The session was presided over by speaker Abdul Hamid. Chowdhury asked the government to immediately start the trial of war criminals as it was an election pledge of the Awami League. She said the Election Commission, Public Service Commission, judiciary, executive branches and other important departments of the government were mired in controversy due to endless corruption and irregularities during the BNP-led government. "Everything used to dictated by the phone calls of Hawa Bhaban. The Election Commission and the judiciary became farce at the time," she said. Ershad proposed provincial governance system to develop the country. He said: "Take Bangladesh out of Dhaka." He said the construction of Tipaimukh dam started back in 2001. Everybody was quiet then. Still, it is a highlighted issue and we will have to pay attention to the matter." Ershad proposed the prime minister sit with her Indian counterpart. He supported the declaration of emergency on Jan 11, 2007 because, otherwise the BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami would have held the stage-managed election . "So, if they did any mistake, forgive them." He asked for the withdrawal of duty on the newsprint. "Otherwise the seventh wage board will not be implemented. Journalists will be in trouble." bdnews
