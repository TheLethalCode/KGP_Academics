<TITLE> Time to end player burnout, says Venus </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, June 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Five times Wimbledon champion Venus Williams has called for an end to tennis burnout and urged top players not to head off into early retirement. "If tennis players could play longer, I think it would be great," Venus said when asked after her second-round win on Thursday what she would most like to change about the sport.

Serena and Venus have in the past been criticised for sticking to such a light schedule but the softly, softly approach has clearly paid dividends. When asked about when she might contemplate leaving the game, Venus said: "As long as I've got great tennis on my racket I'll keep playing."
