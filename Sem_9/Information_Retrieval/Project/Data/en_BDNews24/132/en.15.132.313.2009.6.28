<TEXT>
 Dhaka, 28 June (bdnews24.com)Expatriate Bangladeshis called home more frequently than their Pakistani, Indian, Sri Lankan and Filipino counterparts, spending $48 a month to stay in touch, a survey says. The survey '"Teleuse at the bottom of the pyramid", conducted by LIRNEasia, a regional ICT policy research institute, found 87 percent of Bangladeshi migrants called home at least once a week, while 34 percent called home daily. Dr Rohan Samarejiva, chairman and CEO of the LIRNEasia, disclosed the result of the survey on Sunday in Dhaka. Dr Samarejiva said the survey was conducted over 1,500 overseas and domestic migrant workers from Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, the Philippines and Thailand. The survey found that on average a Bangladeshi overseas migrant spends $48 per month, as against $15 by an Indian overseas migrant. Overseas migrants mostly work in the Middle East and east or Southeast Asia. On average, they earned approximately $485 and sent $203 home per month. The most popular way of communicating home was by telephone, though unlike the other nationalities, a significant 28 percent also made calls through the internet. A small but significant number of domestic migrants surveyed in Bangladesh were found to be sending money home through mobile phones, despite the lack of a formal mobile payment system in the country. Many apparently use mobile account recharging to transfer money home sometimes even for a fee as high as 20 percent, the survey said. Often, migrants keep good relations with the village top-up agents who encash load transfers from the migrant to his family. Teleuse@BOP is a series of studies that look at how the lowest socioeconomic groups or the 'bottom of the pyramid (BOP)' make use of telecom and other ICTs in their lives. Teleuse@BOP3, the third of these studies, was conducted between 2008 and 2009 and included Bangladesh for the first time. The 2008 study included a survey of BOP overseas and domestic migrant workers from six countries in emerging Asia. Over 1,500 migrant workers were surveyed in late 2008. In Bangladesh, 180 recently returned overseas migrants and 170 domestic migrants, most of whom were males with secondary education, were surveyed.
