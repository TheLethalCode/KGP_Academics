<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 28 (bdnews24.com)A senior BNP leader has said only one parliamentary team will go to Tipaimukh to see the proposed Indian dam. Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, also BNP's policymaking standing committee member, on Sunday asked the government to go public with all data and information received on controversial dam in India's Manipur state on the upstream Borak, which enters Bangladesh as Kushiara. "Sending two or more teams to Tipaimukh will only jeopardise our national unity andreveal our rifts, weakening Bangladesh's bargaining power with India. People do not want it," he said at a press briefing in his business office in Shegun Bagicha. The former minister, however, indicated that the main opposition party might consider sending a separate team to Tipaimukh only in case the parliamentary delegation fails to include experts recommended by them. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina on June 24 suggested that the BNP send its own team of experts and report to the government. The parliamentary team would also go, she told parliament on. Mosharraf alluded to foreign minister Dipu Moni's request to India not to begin the dam construction before the visit of the delegation to Tipaimukh. "The minister's request only shows that our concerns have been well founded." "We have been protesting the dam construction proposal since India had initiated it a decade back, which the government had not heeded then." BNP is now working to raise public awareness about the Tipaimukh issues, he said and added that party chief Khaleda Zia has written to the Indian prime minister about it. BNP is keeping the leaders of a number of foreign nations informed of the developments, he said. "We'll plan our next move after seeing what the government does in this respect," the former minister said. A former Dhaka University geology professor, he observed that Tipaimukh will harm India and will be a veritable death-trap for Bangladesh. "India's proposal to build a dam at Tipaimukh may cause disastrous earthquakes and landslides in the region, as the active 'Dawki geo-techtonic fault' zone is contiguous to the river Barak. "Even the Indian geologists have opposed the construction of the dam at Tipaimukh." Besides, unilateral construction on a water body shared by more than one nation amounts to breaching the international legal regime too, he said. b
