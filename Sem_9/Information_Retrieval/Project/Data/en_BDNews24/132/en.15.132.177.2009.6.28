<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 28 (bdnews24.com)Malaysia will consider providing visa to 55,000 Bangladeshi workers once it rides over the economic crisis, Malaysia's finance minister said. Ahmad Husni Hanadzlah made known his country's position on the issue at a meeting with foreign minister Dipu Moni in New York. Both of them are in the US to attend the UN conference on global economic crisis and its impact on development. Malaysia on March 10 revoked the visas over the controversial comment of a Bangladeshi diplomat. "The foreign minister mentioned that Malaysia had always been the most preferred destination for workers as similarities of culture, religion and even weather made it the most natural choice," said a foreign ministry press statement issued from New York on Sunday. "The Malaysian finance minister expressed his hope that after the world economic crisis would be over, the 55,000 visas would definitely be reconsidered," the statement added. The finance minister proposed a seminar on the prospects of Malaysian investment in Bangladesh and possible exports from Bangladesh to Malaysia, the ministry further said. On May 7, labour and overseas employment minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain said Malaysia took a "political decision" to lift the visa ban. "Withdrawal of the ban is a matter of time, I think," he told bdnews24.com. In March, Bangladesh labour counsellor Talat Mahmud had told a Malaysian TV channel that his country had no problem amid the world recession as 70,000 more Bangladeshis were going for jobs despite the economic slowdown in Malaysia. The counsellor made similar comments to Malaysia's state-run news agency, angering people and politicians in Malaysia, hard hit by the global economic meltdown. The diplomat was later withdrawn. The far-eastern country sent hundreds of Bangladeshi workers back home empty-handed. Dipu Moni and Hossain last month visited Malaysia and had talks with the leaders of the new government there for lifting the ban.
