<TITLE> Explain why crossfire killings not illegal: HC </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 29 (bdnews24.com)The High Court on Monday asked the government to explain why killing without trial in so-called crossfire or encounter will not be declared illegal. The government is also to explain why departmental and criminal actions should not be taken against those who perpetrate such extra-judicial killings in custody and outside. The bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Kamrul Islam Siddiqui asked the home secretary, the inspector general of police and the director general of Rapid Action Battalion to reply to the rule within four weeks. The rule came upon a writ petition filed on June 21 by human-rights organisations Ain O Salish Kendra, Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust and Karmojibi Nari. The lawyer for the writ petitioners, Saifur Rashid, said in the hearing that 969 men have been killed in 'crossfire' and 'encounters' with the RAB and police since RAB was founded in 2004. These shooting incidents are commonly reported as 'crossfire' in the media, a term which has come to imply 'suspicious' or extra-judicial killings. The lawyer said these killings are violation of the fundamentals of human rights stated in article 27, 31, 32 and 35 of the constitution. On behalf of the government, additional attorney general MK Rahman said the incumbent government was against the extra-judicial killing and alert to any death in the name of 'crossfire'. In Dhaka alone, at least 10 people have been reported dead in recent weeks, in 'exchanges of gunfire' involving Rapid Action Battalion and police. These shooting incidents are commonly reported as 'crossfire' in the media, a term which in the past has also come to connote 'suspicious' or extra-judicial killings. Most recently, controversy was sparked when two polytechnic students were killed in RAB 'crossfire' in the capital early this month. State minister for home Tanjim Ahmed had said the RAB had launched a departmental investigation into the death of the two students. According to rights group Odhikar, 322 people were killed during the last two years of the caretaker government led by Fakhruddin Ahmed in "crossfire". Prime minister Sheikh Hasina herself announced in February that the extrajudicial killings perpetrated during the tenure of the military-installed interim government would be investigated. International and local rights groups, including Amnesty International, US-based Human Rights Watch, Transparency International, Bangladesh and Odhikar, over past decades have frequently expressed concern over the rate of extra-judicial killings in the country. HRW, in May, in a damning report, suggested 'elite' security forces such as Rapid Action Battalion and the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) be disbanded
