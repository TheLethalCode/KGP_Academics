<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 30 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka Metropolitan Police have banned covered goods trucks with a capacity of more than one-and-a-half tonnes from operating in the capital during the day, between Sunday and Thursday in an attempt to reduce large vehicles clogging roads during peak hours. The decision was taken during a meeting between police and representatives from the road haulage sector at the DMP headquarters, a police spokesperson said Tuesday. The movement of these vehicles within the city will be restricted to between sunset and dawn, said DMP additional deputy commissioner Walid Hossain. "Covered trucks will only be allowed to move within the city during the day on Fridays and Saturdays," he said. Traffic police have also been directed to stop vehicles loading and unloading raw materials in Jatrabari and Karwan Bazar kitchen market areas to reduce traffic congestion, he said. Large open-topped trucks are already banned from Dhaka during the day; and the expanded policy aims to prevent vehicle owners sidestepping the rules by altering the appearance of their vehicles, added Hossain. bd
