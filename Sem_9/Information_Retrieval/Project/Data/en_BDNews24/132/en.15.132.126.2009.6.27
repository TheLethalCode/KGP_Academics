 Dhaka, June 27 (bdnews24.com)  As many as 12 national footballers have been cleared fit on Saturday for training after they went through a second medical test in Chittagong. The players coming from Cox's Bazar went through two tests -- eco cardiogram and exercise tolerance test -- at the United Hospital in the port city under the supervision of Dr Jamal Ahmed and Dr Parvez as their reports of electro cardiogram (ECG) found something different in Dhaka. "The first report suggested having further tests on 11 players, who went through the ECG tests in Dhaka and we completed it Chittagong as the players have been training in Cox's Bazar," said BFF vice-president Badal Roy adding that midfielder Arman Aziz had his ECG test in Chittagong. "After having examined two tests, all of them have been cleared fit for practice today (Saturday) as the reports suggested their cardiac was functioning as usual," said Roy adding that coach Edson Silva Dido had opposed to keep those 12 players in the conditioning camp at Cox's Bazar following their EGC reports. Roy, also chairman of the National Team Management Committee, said he and the players were now felt relieved after some anxious days. Those who went through tests are Aminul Haq, Mazharul Islam Himel, Arman Aziz, Zahid Parvez Chowdhury, Enamul Haq, Abdul Baten Komol, Arifur Rahman, Rana, Rezaul, Rasel Ansari and Mubarrak Hossain.
