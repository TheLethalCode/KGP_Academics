 LONDON, June 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova was pleased to get her second round match at Wimbledon out of the way early on Thursday so she had more time to enjoy an afternoon's shopping in London.

But she could not sustain her form and, trailing 5-3 and serving to stay in the match, hit a shot long to hand Kuznetsova an early present ahead of her 24th birthday on Saturday.
