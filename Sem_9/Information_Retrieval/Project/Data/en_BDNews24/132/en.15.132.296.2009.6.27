 Dhaka, May 31 (bdnews24.com)The parliamentary probe body investigating corruption allegations against former speaker Jamiruddin Sircar will submit its findings to parliament in the upcoming budget session, said the committee's chairman Fazle Rabbi Mian on Sunday. The Mian committee met on Sunday and decided to shift the date for inviting Sircar, his former deputy Akhter Hamid Siddiqui and former chief whip Khandaker Delwar Hossain to defend themselves against graft charges. The committee earlier decided to ask them to appear before the committee on June 10. The budget session starts on June 4. "We cannot hear from Sircar and others on June 10 as the parliament secretariat is undertaking huge preparations for placing of the national budget on June 11," Mian told reporters after the meeting at parliament building. "But, we will prepare the report and submit the same in the budget session," he said. Meanwhile, the sub-committee, formed by the standing committee to probe the expenditure on parliament's different purchases, submitted its findings to the main committee. "The report is with the main committee which will meet soon to fix the date for hearing from Sircar and others," Shajahan Khan told bdnews24.com. Speaker Abdul Hamid, in the face of strong demand from the MPs, formed an 11-member probe body on March 19to investigate allegations of corruption and irregularities by the speaker of the 8th parliament Sircar and other high officials. The standing committee formed three sub-committees to thoroughly probe the allegations. One of the sub-committees has said that Sircar drew over Tk 28 lakh illegally for his treatment abroad. Another sub-committee found that former chief whip and BNP secretary-general Khandaker Delwar Hossain took Tk 18 lakh from the MP Club's fund for medical treatment overseas. It found that present chief whip Abdus Shahid and former whip Wahidul Alam also received Tk 1 lakh and Tk 4 lakh respectively from the fund for the same purpose.
