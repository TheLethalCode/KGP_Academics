<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 1 (bdnews24.com)The Trading Corporation of Bangladesh will start selling edible oil, pulses and sugar in the second week of August to keep prices of essentials stable during the month of Ramadan, commerce minister Faruq Khan said on Wednesday. "The TCB will appoint two agents in each Upazila so that no one can monopolise the business," Khan told reporters after a meeting of the parliamentary standing committee on the commerce ministry. The corporation will receive the consignments of edible oil, sugar and pulses by the first week of August, he said. "Ramadan is expected to start on August 20. So, we will start selling the products through the TCB before Ramadan to prevent market manipulation," said Khan. He said the state-run trading body would import gram flour, onion and other products in a second phase. "We have already started appointing TCB dealers," said the commerce minister. Abdul Jalil, the standing committee chairman, told reporters the committee had also asked the ministry to hold talks with the private sector to check price spirals during Ramadan. "The TCB and the commerce ministry have two monitoring cells. Besides, the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry also has a monitoring cell. "We will watch the prices of essentials with the reports of the three cells," said Khan.
