 ROME, Sun Jun 28, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's approval rating has slipped below 50 percent after a scandal about prostitutes and news that his wife was divorcing him because of his relationship with a teenage girl from Naples. Berlusconi's credibility is under attack just when he is about to host a summit of G8 leaders, and he has had to spend his time defending his private life and denying he paid for sex. The 72-year-old media tycoon had an approval rating of 49.1 percent in a new opinion poll by ISPO for Corriere della Sera newspaper published on Sunday.

The ISPO poll showed a sharp fall in support among women and young people, but especially among practicing Catholics, where his approval dropped to 54 percent from 61 percent. The church in Italy has been particularly critical of the "bad" moral example that Berlusconi has been setting for young people. But Mannheimer said Berlusconi's support was still unusually high because, as some of those polled had said, as long as he acted decisively on issues such as the Naples rubbish crisis and the recession, "he can consort with all the girls he wa
