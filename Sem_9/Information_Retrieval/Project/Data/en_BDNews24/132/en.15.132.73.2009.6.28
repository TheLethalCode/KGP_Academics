<TEXT>
 Cox's Bazar, Jun 28 (bdnews24.com)The government has decided to cancel the BNP-led coalition government's policy on the handover of the 'Jhilangja mouja' plots in the district, the land minister said on Sunday. Rezaul Karim Hira said the government has also formed a committee to see if that government had adopted any irregularities to allot the plots. The decision came from an inter-ministerial meeting on modifying government land settlement policy in hotel and motel zones in the district, Hira told reporters after the meeting. Allotment of plots at 'Jhilangja mouja' in Cox's Bazar, which has the world's longest sea beach, is aimed to promote tourism industries and attract tourists from home and abroad. The committee, headed by the tourism secretary as convener, has been given 30 working days to report, based on which the government will decide if the allotment of the plots made so far will be cancelled. The minister said the alliance government had brought changes into a previous policy to allot the plots so that those who got the plots can hand those over to others. Hira said many of the 87 plots allotted so far since 2002 were handed over to a third party. No plots would be handed over until the committee was done with the work, he added. bd
