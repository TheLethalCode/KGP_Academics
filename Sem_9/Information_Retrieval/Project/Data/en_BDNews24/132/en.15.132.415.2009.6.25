 Dhaka, June 25 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court has extended the bail of BNP chief Khaleda Zia's son Tarique Rahman for six more months in the Bashundhara bribery case, a lawyer said on Thursday. The Appellate Division led by chief justice MM Ruhul Amin made the order after Tarique filed an appeal. Tarique's lawyer barrister Rafique-ul-Huq told bdnews24.com after the verdict the court had extended Tarique's bail on health grounds. Huq submitted a medical certificate on Tarique's present physical condition to the court. He said during the hearing that his client had been undergoing treatment in London. "As Tarique needs more treatment the bail period should be extended," Huq said. Additional attorney general Murad Reza opposed the appeal and said Tarique was doing politics in London. Tarique stands accused of taking about Tk 21 crore in bribe to conceal the involvement of Safiat Sobhan in the murder of Bashundhara Group director (communication) Humayun Kabir Sabbir. Sabbir was murdered in 2006. A case was filed three days later with Gulshan Police Station. bdne
