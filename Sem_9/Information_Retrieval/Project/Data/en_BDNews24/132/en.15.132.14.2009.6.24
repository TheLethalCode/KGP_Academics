 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com)Water resources minister Ramesh Chandra Sen told parliament Wednesday that he would disclose all information about India's planned Tipaimukh dam over the Barak river in Monipur state, upstream of the Meghna, one of Bangladesh's major waterways. He alleged that some quarters were campaigning against the Awami League government. "The opposition parties and some opposition-backed media are campaigning against the government over the construction of the Tipaimukh dam," Sen told parliament, while delivering his speech on the proposed new budget. He said a parliamentary team, headed by the standing committee on water resources would visit India and have talks with the India government. "After receiving the relevant date and information, I will let the Jatiya Sangsad and people know all about it," said Sen. However, foreign minister Dipu Moni on June 19 told journalists that India had already provided Bangladesh with data on the planned dam. She said her ministry had sent the information to the water resources ministry for review. But the data has yet to be made public. The dam, according to environmental experts in Bangladesh, may be catastrophic for the greater Sylhet region. It also faces opposition by Indian environmental groups. bd
