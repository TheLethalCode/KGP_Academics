<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 30 (bdnews24.com)The opposition BNP has asked agriculture minister Motia Chowdhury to apologise for her 'false comments' on party chief Khaleda Zia. Vice-president Hafizuddin Ahmed said on Tuesday the comment the agriculture minister made on Khaleda referring to his book 'Rokte Bheja Ekattor' was 'untrue and bizarre'. Motia on Monday said Hafizuddin in his book at page 245 had said that he had asked Khaleda, the wife of then the major Ziaur Rahman, to move to the liberated zone but she did not heed. "That was totally untrue and imaginary," said Hafizuddin, a freedom fighter and a retired army major. There were only 111 pages in the book published in 1997, the BNP leader said. He said that he did not say anything about the conjugal life of Ziaur Rahman. Motia said the book mentioned their unhappy conjugal life. The comment was the reflection of her pervert mentality, the former minister said. "Motia Chowdhury should apologise to Khaleda Zia for her comments." b
