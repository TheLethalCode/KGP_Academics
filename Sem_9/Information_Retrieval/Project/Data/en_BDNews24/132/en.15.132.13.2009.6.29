 Dhaka, June 29 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh cricket team left here on Monday for the West Indies to play two Tests, three one-day internationals and one Twenty20 international in July. It is Bangladesh's second away series in the West Indies since 2004 when they drew the first Test on the final day after Habibul Bashar and Khaled Mashud made hundreds and Mohammad Ashraful hit 81 to help the side reach 416 in the first innings. But this time round, for seven of the 15 players it will be their first tour of the Caribbean as well as facing a new-look West Indies side. The players have not played a longer-version match since January after the two Test series against Sri Lanka at home, but newly appointed captain Mashrafe Bin Mortaza believed that it was just a matter of adjustment. The focus, however, will remain on Mashrafe's predecessor Mohammad Ashraful, who was relieved to allow him to play his natural game. Besides, the newcomers will be hoping to cement their places in the side as pressure mounts on the selectors to allow those cricketers, who scrapped their contracts with Indian Cricket League recently, to return to domestic cricket. Bangladesh will open their tour with a three-day warm-up match in Barbados on July 3. The first Test starts in St Vincent on July 9. Both sides then move to Granada to play the second and final Test on July 17. The one-day internationals are scheduled for July 26, 28 and 31. The lone Twenty20 is on August 2 before the team heads off to Zimbabwe to play in a five-match ODI series in Bulawayo. Squad: Masrafe Bin Mortaza (captain), Shakib Al Hasan (vice-captain), Tamim Iqbal, Zunaed Siddique, Roqibul Hassan, Mohammad Ashraful, Kazi Shahadat Hossain, Syed Rasel, Mahmud Ullah, Rubel Hossain, Mehrab Hossain Jr, Imrul Kayes, Mahbubul Alam, Enamul Haque Jr and Gazi Shahagir Hossain. bd
