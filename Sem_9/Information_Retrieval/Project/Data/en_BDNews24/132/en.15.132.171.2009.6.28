<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 28 (bdnews24.com)Awami League presidium member Amir Hossain Amu has contradicted the power minister's claim that the daylight saving time is saving electricity and said more power outages are happening now. State minister for power Shamsul Haq Tuku on Saturday told parliament that the advancing the clocks by one hour saved 200-330 mega watts of power every day. "Power minister has advanced the clocks by one hour. This move increased instead of decreasing load shedding," Amu told parliament on Sunday in his speech on the proposed budget for 2009-10 fiscal year. "I urge the power minister to look into the matter. Ramadan is ahead. The power minister must take measures so that the Muslim devotees do not face power outage, the former food minister said. Amu came down hard on the opposition BNP for not doing enough to resolve water disputes with India. Tofail Ahmed, another presidium member, in his speech said the Awami League government would not compromise with anyone on the country's interests. "The BNP did not say anything about the Tipaimukh dam (while it governed the country)," Tofail said. "This dam cannot be constructed if it goes against Bangladesh's interests," he said. bd
