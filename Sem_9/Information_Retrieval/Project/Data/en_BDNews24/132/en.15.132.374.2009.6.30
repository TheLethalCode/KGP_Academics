 Dhaka, June 30 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court sent convicted former BNP minister Shahjahan Siraj into jail on Tuesday in a tax dodge case. The former forests and environment minister was shown arrested on twin charges of accumulating illegal assets and hiding wealth information. Judge Jasmine Anwar of Special Judge's Court-4 made the order just before 1pm after the ex-minister turned himself in to the court at around 11am. The judge also ordered the jail authorities to take special arrangement for his treatment and award him division in jail. Advocate Ashraful Alam, barrister Omar Sadat and Sarwat Siraj Shukla stood for the defendant while special public prosecutor Mosharraf Hossain Kajal for the state in the hearing. The defendant's counsels said the cases were filed during the caretaker government to harass him politically. Siraj remained fugitive to save his life, they said. The High Court on Jan 25 granted him bail in the tax evasion case. The National Board of Revenue filed the case against Siraj during emergency rule, alleging that he had evaded paying tax on money spent for the wedding of his daughter, barrister Sarwat Siraj Shukla. A Dhaka Special Judge's Court on Apr 23, 2008 sentenced him to 13 years in jail for accumulating illegal wealth and suppressing wealth related information while another Special Judge's Court on Aug 29, 2007 handed down eight years' imprisonment in tax evasion case. b
