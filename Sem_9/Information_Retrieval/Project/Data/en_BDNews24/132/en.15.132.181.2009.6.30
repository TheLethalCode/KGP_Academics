<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 30 (bdnews24.com)Opposition chief whip Zainal Abdin Farroque has alleged that the government has so polluted the environment of the parliament that they are unable to participate there. "The government has been slandering us all along and of late further intensified their campaign," he told reporters on Tuesday at the parliament media centre. "A senior Awami League leader has asked the opposition to resign and quit the parliament, which only made it apparent that they want it all to themselves." Suranjit Sengupta, AL presidium member, on Monday called upon the opposition MPs to resign and leave the parliament if they continued shunning it. Farroque said: "We condemn this attitude of the government and would like to remind them that the parliament without opposition might very well fail itself, its existence being at stake." The reasons for BNP's boycotting, he said, included non-allocation of required number of seats in the first row and denying them their entitlements. "The government has been maligning us and especially our leader by serving her a house eviction notice. The matter is on trial in the court." "The government has been constantly campaigning against Khaleda Zia on that account. This is very sad." The AL leaders in the budget session made reckless comments about late president Ziaur Rahman also, complained Farroque
