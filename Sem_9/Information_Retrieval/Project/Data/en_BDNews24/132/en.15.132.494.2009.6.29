 Dhaka, Jun 29 (bdnews24.com)Opposition chief Khaleda Zia on Monday sent a list to prime minister Sheikh Hasina containing names for a six -member representative team to visit the controversial Indian Tipaimukh dam site in India. The delegates are BNP vice-president MK Anwar, former water resources minister Hafiz Uddin Ahmed, former water resources secretary Muhammad Asafuddoula, former Dhaka University vice-chancellor Moniruzzaman Miah, former director general of Water Development Board Sharif Rafiqul Islam and water specialist Prof Abdur Rob. Among them, Anwar and Hafiz Uddin have been mentioned as "BNP representative" and the others as "technical experts". A three-member delegation led by BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan handed the letter to the prime minister's assignment officer Manoj Kanti Boral and protocol officer Proloi Kumar Joardar. "We think our national unity would have been reflected well if we all could send one team comprising technical experts to visit Tipaimukh," Khaleda said in the letter. "But you have proposed BNP send a separate delegation to Tipaimukh. We've agreed to your proposal considering national interest. "We want to send a delegation consisting of technical experts," the letter reads. Quoting foreign minister Dipu Moni as saying that India has provided Bangladesh with information on the dam, Khaleda asked Hasina to supply the information to BNP so that the opposition delegation can prepare well. The BNP chief on June 22 wrote to Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh, informing him of Bangladeshis' concern over the proposed dam. Hasina on June 24 suggested that the BNP send its own team of experts and report to the government. The parliamentary team would also go, she told parliament on. India has approved plans for a 1,500 megawatt project at Tipaimukh in Manipur state on the Barak River which flows from the northeast into Bangladesh.. Experts warn that the dam could cause two Bangladeshi rivers, the Surma and Kushiara in Sylhet, to dry up. Oopposition parties and environmental experts say will affect a river system shared by the two countries. Barak carries seven to eight percent of Bangladesh's water supply. Hundreds of small rivers and water bodies are dependent on the river for water supply. Environmentalists in Bangladesh fear that the drying up of the water bodies will lead to the unemployment of millions of people dependent on the water bodies. bd
