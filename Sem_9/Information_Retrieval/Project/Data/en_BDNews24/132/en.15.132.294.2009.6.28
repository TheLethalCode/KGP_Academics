<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 27 (bdnews24.com)Former finance adviser Akbar Ali Khan on Saturday criticised the allocation for women in the proposed budget and said that it was not sensitive to women. "Those projects women have been linked to in this budget are shameful and frustrating. There are so many irrelevant issues in the proposed budget that have nothing to do with women." "Fund allocation in the budget is not the main issue for women development, rather women empowerment is needed to improve women's situation," Khan, also chairman of Regulatory Reforms Commission, said at a discussion. The discussion titled "Proposed national budget (2009-2010): gender perspective," was organised by Bangladesh Mahila Parishad. The meeting was presided over by Ayesha Banu, president of the organisation. "Their (women's) social status should be strengthened. A social structure should be ensured for them." He suggested special allocation in the budget to encourage women entrepreneurs. Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies researcher Dr Naznin Ahmed presented the key note in the meeting. bd
