<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 1 (bdnews24.com)President of the Garment Workers Unity Forum, Moshrefa Mishu, alleged on Wednesday that a 'certain quarter' was exploiting the ongoing labour unrest and creating chaos in the export-focused readymade garment sector. "When garment workers took to the street for their rights, rag traders and other opportunists set fire to production lines among other criminal actions," said Mishu at a press conference in the city. She said the methods garment workers employ to register their demands would change in future with the introduction of adequate trade unions in the sector. "When workers are organised in trade unions, they will strike bargains with management within their factories, undisturbed by outside influence," said Mishu. She said the government could not shirk its responsibility over the killing of two workers on May 27 and 28 by law enforcers. "We want the arrest and trial of the factory owners, Ansars and the policemen responsible for the deaths." The government worries about 4,000 factory owners, but "we would like to know what steps are being taken to ensure the security and safety of two-and-a-half million workers who toil in those factories," he said. Mishu rejected the need for an industry-specific police force, saying the creation of another law enforcement agency prior to the settlement of current demands would only lead to further chaos. b
