 LONDON, June 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former champion Maria Sharapova had her lack of match practice exposed by unseeded Argentine Gisela Dulko who claimed a nailbiting 6-2 3-6 6-4 victory in the second round at Wimbledon on Wednesday. Sharapova, ranked 60 after suffering with a shoulder injury but given a special seeding of 24 here, had battered Dulko for the loss of three games in two previous meetings.

The Argentine stayed calm to seal victory on her nerve-wracking fifth match point and consign the 2004 champion to her second straight second-round defeat at SW19. Dulko now faces a third-round contest against Russian 10th seed Nadia Petr
