<TITLE> Grenade in Kashmir wounds four soldiers </TITLE>

 SRINAGAR, Jun 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Suspected separatist rebels lobbed a grenade at a security patrol in the heart of Srinagar on Saturday, wounding four paramilitary soldiers, police and witnesses said. The attack, the first after many months of calm in Srinagar, Kashmir's summer capital, came a day after two Pakistani soldiers were killed in the first ever suicide bombing in a part of Kashmir held by Pakistan. India and Pakistan claim the disputed Himalayan region in full but rule it in parts. They fought two of their three wars over Kashmir since gaining independence from Britain in 1947. No group has claimed responsibility for Saturday's attack. Separatist violence in Kashmir has fallen sharply since the nuclear-armed South Asian rivals began a peace process in 2004. But India stalled that initiative after November's Mumbai attack. Analysts see Saturday's attack as a grim reminder that militancy had not disappeared completely in Kashmir, where officials say tens of thousands of people have been killed since a revolt against Indian rule broke out in 1989
