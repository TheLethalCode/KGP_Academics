<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 30 (bdnews24.com)  BTCL will provide land line connections free of charge for three months from Wednesday (July 1), and waive line rental charges in a bid to boost connectivity in rural areas, telecommunications minister Raziuddin Ahmed Razu said Tuesday. Optical fibre connections will also be installed at the upazila and village level to encourage cyber caf and call centre businesses to be set up, creating employment opportunities too, Razu told a press conference at the ministry. The free land line connections will be provided on a first-come first-served basis over the next three months, although the deal will not be available in areas without exchanges, said Razu. He said the new BTCL call rate of 30 paisa per minute will also come into effect from July 1, while other operators will have a rate of 65 paisa per minute. The new call rate will be inclusive of monthly line rental, which will effectively be waived for all BTCL users from Wednesday. Meanwhile, the government will spend $211 million to expand state-owned Teletalk's mobile phone network across the country, Razu said. According to the Bangladesh Telecommunications Regulatory Commission, BTCL has an estimated 872,000 customers, while Teletalk has 11 lakh customers countrywide. b
