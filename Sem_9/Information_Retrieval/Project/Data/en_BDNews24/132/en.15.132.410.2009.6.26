 Dhaka, June 26 (bdnews24.com)An adviser to the prime minister has slammed Awami League general secretary Abdul Jalil for his Thursday's criticism of the prime minister's advisers and demanding their removal from cabinet meetings. "He could talk to the prime minister if he felt offended for not having a position in the cabinet. But this is not the way to speak," Alauddin Ahmed, who advises the prime minister on education, social development and politics, told reporters on Friday at the CIRDAP auditorium in the city. Jalil had told the parliament that prime minister Sheikh Hasina can appoint advisers, but they cannot sit at cabinet meetings. The ministers have sworn oath of secrecy, they have not, he added. He also accused unspecified advisers of hampering the work of the government. "If they attempt to steer the cabinet, the proposed budget will not be implemented. Digital Bangladesh will never come true," said Jalil. Ahmed said: "We, the advisors, are sincerely carrying out our responsibilities following the directions of the prime minister." "We have come to run the country with a dream. We are doing our level best to assist the prime minister though we are in small positions," Ahmed said. "We do not care about such remarks as long as the prime minister has faith in us," he said. bdnew
