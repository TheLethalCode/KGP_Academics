 Dhaka, Jun 24 (bdnews24.com)Awami League MP Tofail Ahmed Wednesday defended the three-year amnesty period for undisclosed money saying if the time was shorter they would be unable to put all the funds to productive use. One year was not long enough for the money to enter productive sectors of the economy, he told a post budget discussion organised by the Economic Reporters' Forum. Tofail, who heads the parliamentary standing committee on industry, termed the proposed budget "realistic and up-to-date", adding that there is scope to amend the proposal for legalising black money. "The government will consider the public's opinion at each-and-every step," he said. Tofail critiqued previous administrations for allowing undeclared income to be legalised over short period without any conditions, such as investment, attached. "Those were great chances for black money holders...they just came in and whitened their money." He said the government's maiden budget reflected their election manifesto: "In fact, the election manifesto was the basis of this year's budget." On a separate but crucial issue, Tofail said national shortfalls in power production would not end until the country's coal and gas reserves were more fully exploited. "However, it's tough for a political government to evict people from their homes in the name of coal exploration," he said. FBCCI president Annisul Huq said foreign investment in the country would not grow until the power crisis is solved: "All developed countries, including the US and China, are using coal-fired power plants." Annisul said it is regrettable that a win-win situation could not be created for the inhabitants around the 100-square kilometre Phulbari coalfield. The FBCCI president also recommended renovating all power plants over 20 years old under public private partnership initiatives. bdnews
