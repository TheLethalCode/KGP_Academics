 Dhaka, June 27 (bdnews24.com)Former speaker Jamiruddin Sircar did not appear on Saturday before a parliamentary panel to defend himself against the charges of corruption and irregularities. The 11-member parliamentary committee on June 20 summoned Sircar, his deputy Akhter Hamid Siddiqui and former chief whip Khandker Delwar Hossain to hear their side of the story on seven corruption charges. Siddiqui and Delwar also did not attend the committee meeting at the parliament building. The committee members headed by Awami League MP Fazle Rabbi Mian waited since 10am at the cabinet committee room to see if any of the three would turn up at the meeting. "I did not attend the meeting as they have not provided me with the papers to substantiate their corruption charges against me," Sircar, now an opposition BNP MP who is on a trip to his constituency in Bogra, told bdnews24.com Saturday by telephone. "They are very much prejudiced to recommend measures against me. That is why they refused to provide me the papers," he said. "How I can reply to the charges if I am denied the papers," Sircar questioned. He said the committee in a letter said it would not provide him the documents beforehand. "If they provide me the papers I will attend the meeting in future," Sircar said. The probe committee on June 21 sent a letter to Sircar asking him to clarify his past actions. It also said Sircar would be able to get the papers only if he attended Saturday's meeting. Sircar in his reply on June 22 told the committee that he would attend the meeting provided he was given the papers to defend himself. In the June 21 letter, the committee said Sircar had drawn medical allowances without approval from the authorities, resorted to irregularities in appointing staff in the parliament secretariat and purchasing goods. It also said the former speaker used more vehicles than his entitlement resulting in consumption of additional fuel, spent additional funds on parliament's beautification and failed to return the materials and equipment he had taken from the parliament secretariat. The letter further said Sircar extended the contract of parliament's cafeteria through irregular means. "All the allegations are vague and unspecific. "Besides, the committee was formed in violation of the rules of procedure," said Sircar. He reiterated in his letter that the probe committee was constituted "illegally" with "mala fide and ulterior motive". "The constitution of such a committee has undermined the office of the honourable speaker of the House of the Nation," the letter said. Speaker Abdul Hamid, in the face of strong demands by ruling Awami League MPs, formed the committee.
