<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 25 (bdnews24.com)The government has decided to remove all barriers to re-commissioning the upazila trial courts, the law minister told the parliament on Thursday. Shafiq Ahmed said the government has plans to remove the barriers to re-introducing magisterial courts at the upazila level which will meet the needs of primary trial courts. The minister responded to a query of Benazeer Ahmad, MP from Dhaka-20 constituency, in the 'question-answer' session. The government has not considered scrapping the Special Powers Act, 1974, the minister said while answering a question from Syeda Ashifa Ashrafee Papia. The law allows the law-enforcers to make arbitrary arrests. Another query from Papia on litigations for harassing people prompted the minister to deplore the large number of such cases filed during the caretaker government's regime. The business of the incumbent government is not character assassination of politicians, but it aims to attain economic freedom through establishing rule of law, said Ahmed. All citizens including politicians found guilty of committing irregularities will be taken to task by the government, he said. On the law for combating women and children repression, the minister, replying to a query raised by Apu Ukil, MP, said that the Women and Children Repression (Prevention) Act 2000 did not prescribe any punishment for teasing women or children. Steps will be taken soon, said the minister, to entail appropriate penalties for relevant offences in line with the recent High Court directives. As KH Rashiduzzaman, MP from Kushtia-3, asked about recruitment of judicial assistant judges and judicial magistrates, Ahmed said a case of recruiting over 200 assistant judge judicial magistrates is under process. Answering a question raised by Sunamganj-5 MP Muhibur Rahman Manik, the law minister said some 5, 888 cases had been withdrawn by the home ministry during the BNP-led coalition government's rule, on top of withdrawal of the names of 3,010 accused involved in 935 litigations. On the river water sharing agreements with India, water resources minister Ramesh Chandra Sen said responding to a query from Jafrul Islam Chowdhury, MP, Chittagong-15 that Bangladesh and India share the waters of 54 rivers. India has erected Farakka Barrage on the upstream Ganges, Mahananda Barrage on the upstream Mahananda and Teesta Barrage on the upstream Teesta, he said. Also, India is constructing Khowai Barrage in the upstream of Monu river, Maharani Barrage in the upstream of Gomti river and Kalsi Barrage in the upstream of Muhuri river. Bangladesh in 1996 executed a 30-year Ganges water-sharing treaty with India at Farakka. The India-Bangladesh Joint Rivers Commission in its 32nd meeting convened an expert committee to deal with the water sharing issues concerning the remainder rivers, he added. The JRC has been carrying on deliberations over water sharing issues of eight rivers: Teesta, Monu, Muhuri, Khowai, Gomti, Dharla, Dudhkumar and Feni. The minister expressed hope that treaties will be signed in future involving water sharing issues of the above rivers. b
