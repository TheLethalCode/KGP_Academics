<TEXT>
 KARACHI, June 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ejaz Butt has disbanded the country's senior and junior selection committees a week after the national team won the Twenty20 World Cup in England, the board said in a statement. An interim committee, chaired by former test captain Wasim Bari and set up to pick the squad for the current tour of Sri Lanka, would continue to function, it said. Bari was brought in after former test leg-spinner Abdul Qadir resigned in acrimonious circumstances during the World Cup, saying that Butt did not allow the selectors to make independent decisions.
