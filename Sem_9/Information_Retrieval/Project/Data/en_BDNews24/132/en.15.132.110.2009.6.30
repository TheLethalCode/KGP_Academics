 Dhaka, June 30 (bdnews24.com) - Corporate tax on banks and non-bank financial institutions have been cut from 45 percent to 42.5 percent in the budget passed Tuesday. Finance minister AMA Muhith told bdnews24.com Tuesday that he "forgot" to announce it on Monday. "I forgot to mention the cut in corporate tax cut for the banks and financial institutions when I was presenting the amended budget in parliament on Monday." The amendments to the proposed budget, presented on June 11, included reducing the three-year term for legalising undisclosed money to just one year, and cutting proposed duty on small cars, motor cycles, newsprint and mobile phones. In the face of widespread criticism the finance minister said the period for allowing money whitening had been revised down. In his concluding speech on the 2009-10 budget, Muhith said in the final budget, undisclosed income will be allowed for investment in new industries, infrastructure and the capital market with a 10 percent tax from July 2009 to June 2010. He added that such investment in the capital market could not be withdrawn again for two years. Muhith said that the amended proposals came after considering the situation of middle-class people. Duty on mobile phones was reduced to 12 percent from the proposed 25 percent. For cars with engines between 1000cc and 1500cc, supplementary duty was cut to 30 percent from the proposed 45 percent. bdnews2
