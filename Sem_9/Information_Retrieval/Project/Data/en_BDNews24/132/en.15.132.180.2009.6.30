<TEXT>
 LONDON, June 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sisters Venus and Serena Williams will go into Tuesday's quarter-finals increasingly confident of setting up a fourth family showdown in the Wimbledon final. Five-times Wimbledon winner Venus has ground to make up, having lost twice here to Serena in 2002 and 2003 before enjoying success in the 2008 showpiece. Third seed Venus, consigned to Court One for the second day in a row despite being defending champion, faces Polish 11th seed Agnieszka Radwanska having won the last three of her four encounters with the Pole. Opening on Centre Court will be Russian top seed Dinara Safina, who will enjoy her second consecutive day in the limelight against unseeded German Sabine Lisicki, despite not having yet won a grand slam title. Serena will follow Safina as the American continues her quest for an 11th grand slam title against eighth seed Victoria Azarenka of Belarus. Serena, who destroyed Slovakia's Daniela Hantuchova on Monday, will be looking for revenge having lost to Azarenka in this year's Miami final. Last up on Court One is unseeded Francesca Schiavone of Italy who plays Russian fourth seed and serial grand slam semi-finalist Elena Dementieva. Dementieva has reached the semi-final at every grand slam event including three at Wimbledon in 2000, 2005 and 2008 and is tied 4-4 in her head-to-head record with Schiavone.
