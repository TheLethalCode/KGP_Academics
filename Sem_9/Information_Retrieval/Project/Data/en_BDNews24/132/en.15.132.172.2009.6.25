 Dhaka, June 25 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan (BKSP) emerged champions in the School Girl's Cricket Tournament defeating Viqarunnissa School and College 'B' in the final at the Women's Sports Complex ground on Thursday. Viqarunnissa were bowled out just 32 in 19.4 overs after BKSP racked up 195-4 in the stipulated 20 overs, thanks to a swashbuckling half-century from Azra Raihana. Opting to bat first, BKSP lost opener Marzi Khatun for a two-ball duck in the first over before Nujhat Tasnia and Farzan Haque steadied the innings scoring 28 and 43 respectively. Later, Azra and Sumona Akhter added 94 runs for the unbroken fifth wicket as Azra struck 54 off just 29 balls studded with 11 boundaries while Sumona played a 17-ball 39 that included one six and seven fours. In reply, Viqarunnissa slumped after some quality bowling from woman of the final Sanjida Islam, who claimed four scalps for nine runs while Aka Millika chipped in with two for eight runs to wreck the innings. None of Viqarunnissa players could reach double digits with Dilruba Khushbu and Farzana Monir making an identical four while the highest 19 runs came from extras. bd
