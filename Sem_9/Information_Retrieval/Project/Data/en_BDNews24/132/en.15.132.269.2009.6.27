<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 27 (bdnews24.com)Putting the clock one hour ahead is saving the country 200-330 megawatt of electricity a day, the state minister for power said on Saturday. The country turned its clocks an hour ahead to 12 midnight at 11pm on June 19 for 'an extra hour of daylight' to save power. The saved power is being supplied to export-focused industries and other clients, Shamsul Haque Tuku said in the parliament, replying to a query from woman MP Tarana Halim. More caution about power wastage can contribute to more saving, he said and added that steps such as keeping shops, markets and shopping malls closed after 8pm and load shedding after 8pm would be taken, if it is required. Replying to a query from MP for Naogaon-3 Akram Hossain, the state minister said the government has short, medium and long-term plans to install power plants with 3521 MW generation capacity by 2014. He said the country produces 3500-4200MW against a daily demand for 4000-5200MW on average, he said answering another question from MP for Manikganj-1 ABM Anwarul Haque. Another 726 MW power will be added to the national grid by next year, the junior power minister also said, replying to a query from MP Nazma Akhtar.
