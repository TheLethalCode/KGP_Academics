 Dhaka, Jun 28 (bdnews24.com)Markets across the country ended upbeat on the opening day of the week. Majority of the scrips closed higher due to a buying spree on Sunday which caused the markets to gain for the fourth straight day. Banks drove the day's trading as majority of them ended upbeat with bigwigs like AB Bank and Islami Bank emerging on the top ten turnover board. The buoyant trend of banks, which started last week, is an outcome of speculations over tax cut, according to former DSE chief executive Salahuddin Ahmed Khan. The banking sector, accounting for more than half the total market capitalisation, surged 6.41 percent over the previous week. "The prime minister's assurance on last Sunday of considering bankers' demand to cut down corporate tax from the existing 45 percent caused the hike," said Khan, a professor of finance at the University of Dhaka. Meanwhile, profit-taking caused mutual funds to lose after gaining on Thursday. Pharma and chemical shares ended upbeat, but maintained a slower pace than the previous day. The day turned out to be a good one for power and energy scrips with Power Grid Company of Bangladesh, Summit Power and Titas Gas making it to the turnover board. ICT shares maintained a steady growth along with insurers, but life insurance companies lost. DSE's benchmark general index or DGEN was in an upbeat mood from the outset of the trading. It remained more or less steady in the midday before rising again towards the end to finish 59.41 points or 2.05 percent higher to 2950.47.
