 MOSCOW, Fri Jun 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia and the United States will sign deals on military cooperation when US President Barack Obama visits Moscow next month, Russia's top general said on Friday. "We have outlined the main issues of military cooperation for 2009 and beyond," the head of the Russian general staff, General Nikolai Makarov, said after a 90-minute meeting in Moscow with his US counterpart, Admiral Michael Mullen.

"I'm very encouraged by our meetings and our mutual commitment to address these issues and strengthen our military-to-military cooperation," said Mullen. "We have many common challenges ... whether in Afghanistan or the challenges in missile defence, or in Iran or particularly for security in Europe," he added. Obama travels to Moscow from July 6-8 for a summit with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev where the agenda will include further cuts to ageing nuclear arsenals and US plans to install an anti-missile defence system in Europe. "I very much look forward to the outcome of the very important summit between Presidents Obama and Medvedev in two weeks," said Mullen.
