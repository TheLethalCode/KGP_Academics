 Dhaka, June 29 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Football Federation is thinking of including an African club in the Bangabandhu Cup in October after Algerian Club Cup champions CR Belouizdad showed interest in the eight-team competition in Dhaka. "We have been considering the inclusion of Algerian club CR Belouizdad in the Bangabandhu Cup after the club president through an agent told us that they are interested in participating in the meet," said BFF general secretary Al Mussabir Sadi on Monday. Sadi said that the BFF would arrange accommodation, airfare, food as well as local hospitality for the Algerian side and provide the match fees as there might be no participation fees in the tournament. The African club was initially trying to play a couple of friendly matches in Bangladesh through the agent, through whom the club were offered to play in the tournament, added Sadi. CR Belouizdad, the six-time Algerian league winners, have earned the right to play in the African Confederation Cup after emerging champions in the Club Cup in 2009. They also finished fourth in the league this season. Top clubs from India, Myanmar, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Thailand, Iran, Iraq, Vietnam, South Korea, Malaysia and Uzbekistan are expected to join the country's two favourites outfits Abahani Limited and Mohammedan Sporting in the meet. The BFF general secretary also said that they were trying to bring a French first or second division club's youth team (Under-20 or 21) through a Bangladeshi expatriate, who has close ties with the French Football Federation. bd
