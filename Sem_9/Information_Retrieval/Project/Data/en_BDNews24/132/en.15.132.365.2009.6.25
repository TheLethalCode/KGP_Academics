 Dhaka, June 25 (bdnews24.com)  The Grameen-Danone Nations Cup for 10-12 year-old footballers will get underway on June 28 with 43 districts fighting it out in the first-round at seven different venues. The seven venue champions will later join the BFF development squad in the eight-team finals and the champions of the meet will qualify for the Danone Nations Cup to be held in Sao Paulo, Brazil on October 8-11. The participating teams, split into seven venues, will play in a single-league basis 30-minute match and top two sides will qualify for the regional final, said Anwarul Haq Helal, member of the BFF development committee, at a press conference on Thursday. Apart from Bangladesh, 39 other countries will also take part in the finals in the ultimate footballing nation Brazil, land of the world's greatest players and also a country famous for its festivals and parties. "It is just like a football festival for the 10-12 year-old booters and the matches will take place daylong each and we have already taken measures to ensure the accurate age of the players," said Helal, who, however, expressed his fear that a few teams might withdraw their entries as the parents of the footballers were not willing to release their child to play outside of their respective districts. Bangladesh first took part in the Danone Nations Cup in 2007 with Chittagong kids qualifying for the eighth edition after France legend footballer Zinedine Zidane came to Bangladesh to launch a joint-venture 'Shakti' (curd) product, made by Grameen and Danone. Last year, a school from the remote area of Bogra participated in the finals in France after emerging champions as the food company wanted to make their products popular in Bogra district. "In a bid to extend football among the children, this tournament will take the children to the international arena at the beginning of their life. It is also a dream of going to Brazil and we are pleased to announce the third edition of the tournament in Bangladesh," executive director of Grameen-Danone Food Limited Wahidum Nabi adding that they felt proud of being associated with the Bangladesh Football Federation. "The Danone Nations Cup is 10 years old, ten years of dreams, sharing and sport for over 16 million children," said Marie Soubeiran, the event manager of the Danone Nations Cup. "After six months of national qualifiers in 40 countries, this anniversary will fire up Brazil for a colourful world final rich in adventure. Being held for the first time outside France, Zinedine Zidane, our ambassador and patron, will be there to launch the final of the world's greatest children's football competition. Beyond the sporting aspect, this event is now destined to travel to the four corners of the world and is totally committed to children and their well-being through the implementation of sustainable and long-term actions," said Souberian. She said that from the next year they would try to increase the participating teams as much as possible. BFF general secretary Al Mussabir Sadi and BFF member Sattayajut Das Rupu also spoke on the occasion. Gazipur, Nilphamari, Feni, Kushtia, Rajbari, Sirajganj and Sathkhira will host the regional matches. bd
