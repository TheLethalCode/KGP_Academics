 Dhaka, June 25 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court on Thursday asked BNP leader Hamidullah Khan to move the chamber judge to hear the plea he had made before for a stay on a High Court judgement that Sheikh Mujibur Rahman proclaimed Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan in 1971. "As the chamber judge's bench did not stay the High Court order we appealed to the Appellate Division's regular bench," Khan's lawyer Khandaker Mahbubuddin Ahmed told reporters "The regular bench led by chief justice MM Ruhul Amin asked him to appeal to the chamber judge to set a hearing date for filing the appeal," he said. Another counsel, Moudud Ahmed, said they would file the appeal to the chamber judge on Sunday. A retired wing commander, Khan filed an appeal to the Supreme Court on Tuesday to overturn the HC order. Appellate Division chamber judge Md Abdul Aziz on Wednesday asked Khan to get a copy of that order and file a 'leave to appeal'. The High Court in its June 21 verdict said that Sheikh Mujib, not Ziaur Rahman, proclaimed the independence on a public interest litigation by freedom fighter MA Salam. Khan, who had fought the independence war as the commander of sector 11, I claims that the rule has divided the nation. The High Court also ordered the cancellation of the third volume of Bangladesher Swadhinata Juddho Dalilpatra (Bangladesh Liberation War Documents) printed during the term of the 2001-2006 BNP-led coalition government which described Zia as the 'declarer' of independence. The verdict had also said those who were involved in such distortion of history have violated the constitution and the government could take punitive measures against them. The High Court directed the government to include true history in textbooks at all level. b
