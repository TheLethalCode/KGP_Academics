<TITLE> Suranjit suggests new law to stop MPs skipping parliament </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 29 (bdnews24.com) Ruling Awami League MP Suranjit Sengupta has proposed inclusion of the provision of 'right to recall' in the constitution to prevent opposition MPs from being absent from the parliament. The system will allow the electorate to call back MPs on their failure to deliver. "The opposition should be brought to the parliament. If required the law should be introduced," Sengupta said in the budget discussion in the parliament on Monday. The parliament cannot be effective without the opposition, said Sengupta, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on law, justice and parliamentary affairs ministry. "I request the opposition to discharge their duties coming to the parliament as people have elected them as their representatives," Suranjit, the AL parliamentary party member, said. "'Either come to the parliament or resign', such a system should be introduced. Law should be introduced instead." The veteran MP said it was not possible for the current administration, picked by the BNP-led coalition government, to implement the huge budget. "For that 10-15 percent political recruitment is necessary in the administration." He also expressed displeasure over the absence of finance minister A M A Muhith in the day's budget discussion. Muhith came to the House a few minutes later, though. bdnew
