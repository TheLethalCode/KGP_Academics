 Dhaka, June 27 (bdnews24.com)A rights advocacy group has said it will take the government to court for the changes it made to laws on upazila. SUJON or Citizens for Good Governance is ready to file the writ petition shortly after Upazila chairmen agree to stand as petitioners to resolve their problems, Prof Mozaffar Ahmed, president of the NGO, said on Saturday. If none is found, SUJON will file the writ itself to know if the government has any jurisdiction to change the laws to its own advantage, professor Ahmed said at a open debate organised by Bangladesh Manobadhikar Bastabayan Sangstha (Bangladesh Society for the Enforcement of Human Rights ). The government passed the Local Government (Upazilla Council) Ordinance-2009 with few changes as 'Upazilla Council Act-2009 (Amedment). The upazila chairmen have complained that the new law gave local MPs advisory powers over them and made the lawmakers' suggestions compulsory for the local government bodies to implement Moderator Elina Khan said accountability was a must in every sphere of administration. Coordination, not control, was needed between the MPs and upazila chairmen as both are elected by the people. Speakers demanded a rethink of the activities of the local government, role of the Upazilla Nirbahi officers and area of activities of the MPs. Upazilla chairmen, labour leaders, NGO activists, lawyers and journalists attended the debate. bdnews
