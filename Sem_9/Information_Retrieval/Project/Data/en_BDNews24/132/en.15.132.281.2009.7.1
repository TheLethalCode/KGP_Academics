 Dhaka, July 1 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka University was celebrating 88 years on Wednesday, with the motto 'Higher education through democratisation'. Vice Chancellor Prof AAMS Arefin Siddique formally inaugurated Dhaka University Day, as the annual celebrations are called, by cutting a ceremonial cake in the morning. Professor emeritus Serajul Islam Chowdhury spoke of the university's history and heritage since its birth on July 1 in 1921. "Dhaka University has played unforgettable roles in the last century in bringing about major changes in the socio-political arenas in Bangladesh, which is the chief attainment of this university," said Chowdhury. "A university should always profess to build a base for democratic practices and Dhaka University has accomplished that task most successfully in the past." "We must still strive continuously to acquire knowledge  and raise ourselves as a truly independent nation," Chowdhury said. The day also saw students arriving at the Teacher Student Centre in processions in the morning, where hall provosts hoisted flags of various colours. DU has arranged a three-day exhibition of photographs and paintings titled 'History, heritage and information' at the TSC.
