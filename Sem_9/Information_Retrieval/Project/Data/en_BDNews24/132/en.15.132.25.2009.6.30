 Dhaka, Jun 29 (bdnews24.com)In the face of widespread criticism over the budget provision that allowed investment of undisclosed income for three years in a row, the finance minister on Monday said the period has been revised down to one year. In an unprecedented measure, AMA Muhith in his budget speech on June 11 proposed "acceptance of undisclosed money without any question during the period from July 1 to June 30, 2012. The offer stands provided that 10 percent tax is paid and it is invested in certain new industries such as physical infrastructure facilities and shares of companies listed on the stock exchange. "The undisclosed income invested in the capital market will not be allowed to be withdrawn in two years," he said in the parliament on Monday. The investors will have to clearly spell out how many jobs will be generated. If it turns out that that the fewer jobs have been created than promised, the facility will be cancelled, Muhith said. The government had proposed the three-year amnesty to draw 'black money' into 42 sectors in the capital market, start-up industries and physical infrastructure. The country's apex trade body FBCCI had welcomed the move, a number of other business bodies including the MCCI, BGMEA, BKMEA and the FICCI slammed it. bdn
