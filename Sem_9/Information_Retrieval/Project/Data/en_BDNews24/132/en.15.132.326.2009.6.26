 Dhaka, June 26 (bdnews24.com)Opposition chief whip Zainul Abdin Farroque has accused the government of trying to make the parliament a one-party affair. He demanded that the government make the environment conducive to their joining the parliament. "India is building another death-trap for us by erecting a dam at Tipaimukh. It is also planning to use Bangladesh territory as a corridor by proposing to take the Asian Highway through," Farroque said in a press conference on Friday. "Under the circumstances, the government's efforts to make the parliament 'a single party affair' will only result in weakening the state further." The opposition led by BNP has been shunning the parliament since the beginning of the budget session. He condemned the comments passed by the prime minister Sheikh Hasina in an Awami League meeting on June 24 as 'untrue and baseless'. "The prime minister has called the opposition conspirators. She said BNP assumed power in 2001 by giving an undertaking to India that Bangladesh would be obliged to sell gas to them." "We'd like to protest this saying that the people of this country know very well who all have come to rule the nation on more than one occasion through forfeiting the people's right to voice opinions." The chief whip said, "We hope the government will wake up to the realities and take the initiative to make the parliament effective." Hasina had said on June 24 at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre: "They came to power in 2001 promising India gas sales. I had challenged we would see how they even tried that." The press conference held at the NAM flats raised and discussed a number of issues including the government not accommodating the opposition in the parliament, the attempts at 'ousting' opposition leader Khaleda Zia from her Dhaka Cantonment house, security debacles, and economic crisis. In a written statement, he said, the border guards as a force have been ruined and the army has suffered irreparable losses. The army is being further weakened by 'removal of officers' now, he added. Farroque also demanded a stop to "the oppression" of the opposition. Replying to a query, he said, "BNP will give its names of representatives only if the parliamentary party members to visit Tipaimukh include impartial persons and national experts." "We have forwarded five names under the category of neutral experts. Now the prime minister asks us to send our own team. Will India permit BNP to send in a separate delegation?" the opposition chief whip said on the prime minister's recommendation that BNP dispatch its own Tipaimukh delegation. Among others, MPs Shahiduddin Chowdhury Annie, Abul Khair Bhuiyan, ABM Ashrafuddin, and Syeda Asifa Ashrafee Papia were present. b
