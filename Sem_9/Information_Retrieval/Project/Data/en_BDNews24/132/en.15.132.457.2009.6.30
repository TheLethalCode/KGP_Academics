 LONDON, June 30 (bdnews24.com//Reuters) - Normality returned to Wimbledon on Tuesday after the heady events of the night before with Centre Court open to the sunny skies and the Williams sisters topping the bill in the quarter-finals of the women's singles. Monday's gripping late-night drama in which Andy Murray was made to fight tooth and nail to beat Swiss Stansislas Wawrinka under the new showcourt canopy and blazing lights will go down in Wimbledon folklore as the day the tournament changed forever. Fans arriving at the All England Club on another sweltering day spoke of little else than Murray's spellbinding five-set victory -- a match played out in front of 15,000 fans on Centre Court, thousands more in the dark on Henman Hill and a British television audience of 12.6 million. "The only danger to the roof was that it could have been blown off by the crowds," Wimbledon spokesman Johnny Perkins said of the electrifying events of the previous night. Murray, who had a day off to recover before his last eight assignment against Juan Carlos Ferrero, said it was the noisiest crowd he had ever played in front of -- which for somebody with experience of U.S. Open night sessions was quite a statement. After the "Andymonium" of the night before the quarter-final line-up in the women's singles was always going to struggle to provide the same kind of spectacle. The raucous football stadium atmosphere which reverberated around the All England Club the night before was replaced with the more traditional tranquility and polite applause usually associated with this most English of sporting venues. Since Venus Williams struck her first ball of the tournament there has been an inevitability about her progress and few bets were being taken on Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska, a former Wimbledon junior champion, to halt her march. While Venus, bidding for a third consecutive Wimbledon singles title and sixth overall, was relegated to Court One for the second day in succession, younger sister Serena was scheduled for Centre Court later in the day against feisty Belarussian eighth seed Victoria Azarenka. The American sisters are careering towards a fourth Wimbledon final against each other, although with world number one Dinara Safina and her fellow Russian, Olympic champion Elena Dementieva still there, it is not yet a formality. Safina, who on Monday became the first player to win a match with the new Centre Court roof closed, was on the same lawn on Tuesday, this time under blazing sunshine, to take on unseeded German Sabine Lisicki. Dementieva, who lost to Venus in the semi-final here last year, was up against Italy's Francesca Schiavone who was making her debut in the Wimbledon last eight.
