 Dhaka, June 28 (bdnews24.com)BNP leader Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain says the allegations Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina was served poisoned food in jail should be investigated. Hasina was fed poisoned food while she was in prison during the 2007-08 military-installed caretaker government, deputy leader of the parliament Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury said on Saturday. Mosharraf said, "Such allegations might be well founded in both the ex-prime ministers' (Hasina and Khaleda Zia) cases." "The unelected caretaker government had employed more or less similar tactics to implement their 'Minus Two' theory, which they failed because people would not endorse it." Private TV station RTV quoted the senior Awami League leader as saying. "The leader (Hasina) fell sick having taken the poisoned food and her mouth was swollen. But she never gave in to (pressure)," Sajeda said the prime minister still gets occasional bouts of illness due to the damage caused by the poisoning. Awami League chief Hasina was arrested on July 16, 2007 by the Fakhruddin Ahmed-led interim government on a slew of graft charges and was freed on June 12 next year on bail. Her party says she had been under intense pressure to quit politics and live in exile. Hasina and Khaleda, who was also arrested, were kept in makeshift prisons in the parliament complex. b
