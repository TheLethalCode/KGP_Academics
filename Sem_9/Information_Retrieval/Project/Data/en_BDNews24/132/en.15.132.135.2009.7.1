<TITLE> Democrats reach watershed in Senate </TITLE>

 By Arshad Mahmud Washington, July 1 (bdnews24.com) President Barack Obama got a long-awaited boost on Tuesday as the Democrats reached a watershed in the U.S. Senate, securing a 60-seat majority that would theoretically allow them to pass any legislation without the help of the Republicans. The majority is crucial for Obama at a time when he's pushing for a number of critical issues like healthcare reform and climate change to be passed by Congress. It was reached following a decision yesterday by the Minnesota Supreme Court, which declared comedian-turned-politician Al Franken the winner of the state's U.S. Senate race, ending an eight-month-long legal battle. In a unanimous ruling, the court rejected Republican Norm Coleman's legal arguments that some absentee ballots had been improperly counted and that some localities had used inconsistent standards in counting votes. The ruling led Coleman to concede his Senate seat to Franken, who is expected to be sworn in next week. "The Supreme Court has spoken. We have a United States senator," Coleman said in a news conference outside his home in St. Paul. "It's time to move forward." Franken, joined by wife Franni at a news conference in front of their home in Minneapolis, said, "I can't wait to get started." But he played down the importance of his becoming the 60th Democrat in the chamber. "Sixty is a magic number, but it isn't," Franken said, "because we know that we have senators who -- Republicans who are going to vote with the Democrats, with a majority of Democrats on certain votes, and Democrats that are going to vote with majority Republicans on others. So it's not quite a magic number as some people may say. But I hope we do get President Obama's agenda through." In a statement, the White House said Obama looks "forward to working with Senator-Elect Franken to build a new foundation for growth and prosperity by lowering health care costs and investing in the kind of clean energy jobs and industries that will help America lead in the 21st century." Franken's ultimate victory may have given the Democrats their largest majority in the Senate since 1978, but their ability to prevent filibusters as they attempt to push President Obama's agenda is likely to prove illusory. That is largely because two prominent Democratic senators, Edward Kennedy and Robert Byrd, have missed a raft of votes this year because of illness and, although Byrd was released from a Washington hospital yesterday, it is unclear how often either will be present in the chamber. Besides, there are some senators like Mary Landrieu who are not always in agreement with Obama on issues like health care reform. Furthermore, a number of Senate Democrats representing states that rely heavily on manufacturing jobs have also expressed concern about the climate-change bill, another Obama priority that passed the House last week. "The idea that you've got 60 reliable Democrats for votes for sweeping policy change simply doesn't work; it's not the reality of it," Norman Ornstein, a congressional expert at the American Enterprise Institute, told the Washington Post. "The larger challenge for Obama is managing expectations of people who are thinking: When you get 60 votes, you get do to whatever you want. And they most assuredly do not." Franken, the longtime Democratic activist, is likely to be a reliable vote for the party on nearly every issue and has largely praised Obama's performance thus far. But he has indicated that he will attempt to keep a low profile in Washington. In an interview this year, he said he would seek to replicate the model of former senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, who generally eschewed major speeches in her first few years on Capitol Hill to focus on learning the internal dynamics of the Senate and tried to avoid upstaging her colleagues. Before his Senate bid, Franken had gained a reputation as a comedian appearing on the popular Saturday Night Live for nearly 20 ye
