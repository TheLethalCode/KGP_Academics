<TEXT>
 BEIRUT, Jun 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Lebanon's parliamentary majority leader Saad al-Hariri was appointed prime minister-designate on Saturday, pledging to seek a national unity government but warning that his task would be difficult. President Michel Suleiman issued a presidential decree designating Sunni Muslim Hariri after 86 parliamentarians in the 128-seat assembly nominated him for the post. Hariri said he would seek to form a unity government capable of facing the country's many political, economic and social challenges. "In line with our commitment during the election campaign in favor of a national unity government in which the main parliamentary blocs are represented ... we will begin consultations with all parliamentary blocs ...," Hariri said after receiving his designation decree from Suleiman. "We know that the path to this target won't be easy and the hurdles and bumps might be more than what is apparent, which is already a lot," he warned. The young leader said what was at stake was more serious than forming a government or the allocation of portfolios but rather the very fate of Lebanon during one of the most difficult and critical times in the Middle East's history. Hariri, who is backed by the United States and Saudi Arabia, led a political coalition to victory against Iranian-backed Hezbollah and its allies in this month's election. He is the son of statesman Rafik al-Hariri whose assassination in 2005 plunged Lebanon into the worst crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war. Lebanon's sectarian power-sharing system reserves the premiership for a Sunni. In a sign of the difficulties the 39-year-old leader faces in forming a cabinet acceptable to all sides, Hezbollah and its Christian allies refrained from nominating him. Only 15 out of the minority alliance's 57 deputies backed him in two days of consultations with Suleiman, adding to support from Hariri's 71 deputies. b
