 Dhaka, Jun 29 (bdnews24.com)Registration and photographing of new voters begins on Wednesday under a countrywide programme to updated the photo-based voter list. In the first such attempt of the Election Commission after the electoral roll was prepared a year ago, EC-designated officials went door-to-door in 154 upazilas to collect information on new voters and asked them to go to the registration centres for photo. A government handout on Monday said voters who were not available at home during collection of information but have their names in the registrars can also go to centres to have their names registered and photographs taken. As many as 185 registration teams will be working for two to three days at each union or municipality. bd
