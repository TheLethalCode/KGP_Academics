<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com) - Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has suggested the main opposition BNP send its own team of experts to visit the proposed Tipaimukh Dam site in India and report to the government. The parliamentary team would also go, she told parliament on Wednesday. "And then the government will do whatever is in Bangladesh's best interests." The BNP was asked to provide their MPs' names to be co-opted onto the parliamentary committee that is set to visit the site, said Hasina. "But, they gave a list of experts instead. So we request that they themselves send an expert team to visit the dam." She said BNP wanted "to play games" without resolving the matter. "They were also in power, but they left office without settling the Tipaimukh issue." She said her party and her government would only work in the people's interest. "Awami League will never 'sell out' the country." Hitting out at BNP, who have been loud in their protests against the proposed Tipaimukh Dam, Hasina said they came to power in 2001 offering to sell gas to India. She also took a swipe at the opposition party's criticism of the money whitening offer in the proposed budget. "They should not forget that the prime minister of the BNP government and her two sons, along with their finance minister and his son, whitened black money in the past." She criticised the opposition party for remaining away from parliament and said they were "playing a doll's game". b
