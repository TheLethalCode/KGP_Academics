<TEXT>
 LONDON, Fri Jun 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - One person captured on Internet videos helping "Neda," the young Iranian woman killed last week who has become an icon of the protests, was identified by a British newspaper on Friday as a doctor who has since fled Iran.

He said he had gone outside into Tehran's streets only when he and some friends heard a commotion. Hejazi said Soltan's death would always haunt him but was glad she had become a global symbol.
