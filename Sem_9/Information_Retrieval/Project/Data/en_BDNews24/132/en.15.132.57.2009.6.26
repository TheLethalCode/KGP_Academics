 Mymensingh, June 26 (bdnews24.com)At least 35 students were hurt as two factions of Bangladesh Chhatra League clashed on Friday at Bangladesh Agricultural University. President Sarwar Murshed Akhand and general secretary Mohammed Atiquzzaman Royal of the university unit of the ruling Awami League's student front are leading the rival factions to establish control on the campus. Police raided Bangabandhu, Suhrawardy, Fazlul Huq, Ashraful Huq and Shamsul Huq halls on Friday evening and recovered 24 machetes and 15 hockey sticks. They detained six students but freed four at the behest of the proctor. Additional police superintendent SM Akteruzzaman said violence erupted on Thursday evening and continued on Friday. ASP Akhtaruzzaman said local supporters of the president faction stabbed Shah Mohsinul Huq Shaon of the rival group at Kewatkhali, just outside the campus. Later, around 100 supporters of the secretary-led faction attacked Kewatkhali. At around 9:30pm, local Awami League and Jubo League leaders barricaded the main entrance to the campus and beat the general students, forcing shops at the nearby KR Market and Jobbar Mor to close. At around 10am on Friday the two groups again engaged in clashes at 'Jobbar Mor'. Police charged tear gas shells to tackle the situation. Two cases were filed by the two warring groups. Around 300 policemen have deployed on the campus. The injured include joint secretary Shaon, activists Abdul Wahab Rintu, Abu Raihan, Rana, Dhrubo and Babul Hossain, Jubo League leader of Kewatkhali Abdul Awal Mintu and law secretary of district Awami league Mahbubul Huq Bablu. They were admitted to the Mymensingh Medical College Hospital. Later Shaon and Hossain were sent to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. Besides, 12 more activists received treatment at the medical centre of the university. Proctor Dr Mohammad Shamsuddin said that they had been trying to ensure a peaceful environment for studies. President Akhand told reporters that a faction of the organisation was trying to make the campus a stronghold to run illicit drug business and act as intermediaries of jobs. "We are protesting all the irregularities and anarchy to ensure a proper environment for student politics," he added. Royal said, "A faction is trying to encourage non-student politics by giving assistance to the outsiders. Their dirty politics is making everyone scared." bndnews2
