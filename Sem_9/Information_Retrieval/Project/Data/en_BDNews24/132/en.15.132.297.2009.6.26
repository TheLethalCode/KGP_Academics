<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 26 (bdnews24.com)The main opposition BNP has asked the United Nations to launch a neutral inquiry into the 'persecution and humiliation' of former ministers, MPs and businessmen during the 2007-08 military-installed caretaker and incumbent governments. A BNP delegation, led by the party's international affairs secretary Ehsanul Haque Milon, handed over a memorandum, addressed to the UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, to Kazi Ali Reza, in charge of UN Information Centre at Agargaon in the city. The party also drew the UN's attention to the 'controversial' role of the UNDP resident representative Bangladesh, Renata L. Dessalien's in 'provoking the declaration of emergency in 2007' by issuing a statement. "Questions were raised about the authenticity of the statement issued in your name that was never clarified by her," the memo also said. BNP joint secretary general Abdul Mannan, MP Barkat Ullah Bulu, Jatiyatabadi Juba Dal general secretary Syed Moazzem Hossain Alal, Jatiyatabadi Krishak Dal general secretary Shamsuzzaman Dulu and Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal general secretary Shafiul Bari Babu were present during the memo handover. The memo stated that BNP chief Khaleda Zia, Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina, leading businessmen like former FBCCI presidents Abdul Awal Mintu and Salman F Rahman and many others were harassed during that period. The main opposition party also alleged that at least 40 leaders were killed and more than 25,000 leaders and activists severely injured during the six-month old of government headed by the Awami League. Even opposition chief Khaleda Zia has not been spared, the party also alleged. All the killings and harassment have been committed in violation of the UN Convention against Torture, the party stated in the memo. bdne
