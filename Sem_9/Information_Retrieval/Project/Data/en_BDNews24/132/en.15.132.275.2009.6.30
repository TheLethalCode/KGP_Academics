 Dhaka, June 30 (bdnews24.com)Eight of the nine confirmed cases of swine flu in the country are on the road to recovery and are no longer contagious, IEDCR director Prof Mahmudur Rahman told bdnews24.com Tuesday. The victims were told to remain at home after being diagnosed with the virus and most have now recovered sufficiently to move freely from Wednesday, said Rahman. He said they were no longer contagious or a risk to the public, adding that none of the victims' relatives had become infected either. Travellers arriving in the country continue to be monitored at all the main ports of entry, with 60 individuals being tested for the H1N1 virus to date, said Rahman. He said the most recent case was confirmed on Monday in a person arriving from the United States. Those infected by the virus have largely recovered at home, under observation of the health department, and did not display severe symptoms at any time, said Rahman. According to the latest figures from WHO, approximately 70,000 cases have been detected in 70 countries, with 311 fatalities recorded. Symptoms of the virus include fever with high temperature and respiratory problems. The IEDCR have advised the public to refrain from spitting and to clean their hand regularly. bd
