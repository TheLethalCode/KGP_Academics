 Dhaka, June 28 (bdnews24.com)The government is taking up with the international organisations the issue of Rohingya refugees to permanently send them back to their homeland, the disaster management minister said on Sunday. Abdur Razzaq told reporters after meeting with UN High Commissioner for Refugees country representative Pia Prytz Phiri at his office that the Rohingya were an extra burden on disaster-prone Bangladesh. He further said that Bangladesh wanted to see the refugees returned permanently and added that many of those who had been sent back had returned. The minister said necessary steps would be taken on non-registered refugees. The decision would come after the discussions with the foreign and home ministries. Phiri appreciated the provision of food and shelter to the Rohingya refugees and said the UN was sincere about a permanent solution to the problem that has become a regional issue. She proposed a joint initiative of Thailand, Myanmar and Bangladesh on the problem. They are the remnants of some 250,000 Rohingyas who fled to Bangladesh from November 19991 to June 1992. Among them 2,36,599 returned home and 24,000 are staying in UN-run Kutupalong camp of Ukhiya in Cox's Bazaar and Noyapara camp of Teknaf. The Rohingya, an oppressed Muslim minority from army-ruled Myanmar, have been leaving Myanmar and heading mainly into Bangladesh since the late 1970s. Buddhist-majority Myanmar does not recognise the Rohingya, who speak a Bengali dialect, as an ethnic group. bdnews
