<TITLE> Hockey league hangs in balance </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 27 (bdnews24.com)  Already two months behind schedule, the league committee of the Bangladesh Hockey Federation still could not convince the clubs to sit together and discuss the fate of 11-team Premier Hockey League. The league was supposed to start in April as per the calendar the BHF provided to the National Sports Council (NSC) and now it appears uncertain following the row over the completion period of the prestigious event. BHF general secretary Khondokar Jamiluddin a few days earlier urged the clubs to complete the league by August as the national team are scheduled to leave in the same month for Germany for a two-and-a-half month training as a part of its preparation for the 2010 South Asian Games in Bangladesh. But giants Abahani and Mohammedan are unwilling to take part in the proposed players' transfer on July 8-10 citing that they were not ready to spend a huge amount behind the teams only for one and a half months as they always form a squad for the title. If the players' transfer is completed on the proposed schedule, the league will get only seven weeks to be completed as the 20-22 national players are scheduled to leave for Germany on August 28. "Actually a team needs a month to be prepared ahead of the premier division league and we will have to think twice whether we will spend Tk 70-80 lakh to form the team only for a short period," said Shahidullah Dolan, joint secretary of the Abahani hockey committee. Dolan said that Abahani might not take part in the proposed players' transfer as they would not be able to convince the Abahani management to spend huge money for just one month. The organiser opined it had better start the league after the return of the national team from Germany in November. Mohammedan hockey secretary Sajed AA Adel, however, was more precise than Dolan saying: "Mohammedan will not take part in the premier league if it is only for one month because it is not possible to spend huge money only for a few weeks." Adel also echoed Dolan's view that they also needed at least a one-month preparation as well as season-curtain raising tournament Club Cup before being engaged in the premier division. The former BHF general secretary, opposing the BHF proposal of holding three matches every day, said that how it was possible to hold three matches in each day amid scorching heat in the country. Both representatives, however, have emphasised the need of all the teams sitting together along with the BHF president. Jamiluddin, however, was determined to send the team to Germany. "I have worked hard to arrange the tour and since our team had never been invited to Europe for training I am determined to send them abroad," he said. The issue depends on the decision of the clubs and Jamiluddin said that he would be present in the next meeting of the league committee to make the clubs understand. bd
