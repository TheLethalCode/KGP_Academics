 WASHINGTON, Fri Jun 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US consumer spending rose last month for the first time since February as government stimulus pushed incomes sharply higher, the Commerce Department said on Friday, supporting the view the economy was close to pulling out of recession. Consumer spending, which accounts for over 70 percent of US economic activity, rose 0.3 percent in May after an upwardly revised flat reading in April, the department said.

Excluding the stimulus package, disposable income rose 0.2 percent, the department said. The stimulus provided for one-time payments of $250 to people receiving Social Security, supplemental security income and other benefits. While spending picked up, most of the stimulus money was socked away. Savings jumped to a record annual rate of $768.8 billion, the highest level since records began in 1959. The saving rate climbed to 6.9 percent, the highest since December 1993. The personal consumption expenditures price index rose 0.1 percent.
