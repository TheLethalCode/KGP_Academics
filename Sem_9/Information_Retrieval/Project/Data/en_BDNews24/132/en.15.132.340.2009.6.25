 BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa, June 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States, who were all but eliminated from the Confederations Cup last Sunday, were still coming to terms with their place in the final after Wednesday's astonishing defeat of Spain. Their stunning 2-0 win over the European champions in the semi-final at the Free State Stadium completed one of the greatest turnarounds in the history of any FIFA competition. They now face either hosts South Africa or five-times world champions Brazil in Sunday's showpiece finale at Ellis Park in Johannesburg. Goals from 19-year-old Jozy Altidore and striker Clint Dempsey gave the Americans a deserved win over the jaded looking Spaniards, who were on a world record run of 15 successive wins and went into the match unbeaten for 35 games. Coach Vicente del Bosque had won all 13 games in charge of FIFA's number one ranked side since he took over after last year's European championship triumph, and virtually no-one outside the U.S. camp gave them any hope of victory. Despite being 14th in the FIFA list, the U.S. are still outsiders in world soccer, achieving their ranking largely by virtue of being a big fish in the shallow CONCACAF pond where minnows like the British Virgin Islands and Belize abound. "That might be right," skipper Carlos Bocanegra said after the game. "But no-one can take this victory away from us. "We deserved it. We defended brilliantly, we were sharper in the tackle, we stopped everything they threw at us, we worked as a team. We were going home last Sunday, now we are going to the final, and we deserve to be there." "STICK TOGETHER" Michael Bradley, who was sent off late in the game and will miss Sunday's final, was still overjoyed his team had qualified. "As a team we've said to ourselves we want to be in the big tournaments and on the big stage," said the midfielder, son of coach Bob Bradley. "Now we have a chance on Sunday to win a big trophy. As a player, the individual stuff doesn't mean anything, my sending off doesn't mean anything. It's a team game. We feel so strong as a team, when a game doesn't go our way we just stick together and keep going and work till it does." The U.S. have done that here. After losing their opening two matches to Italy and Brazil, they went into last Sunday's final Group B match with no points and a goal difference of minus five. They only had the slimmest mathematical chance of qualifying but their 3-0 win over Egypt, along with Brazil's 3-0 win over Italy, saw them squeak through on goals scored. Coach Bradley was just about the only member of the squad who said before the match that his team could beat Spain by playing direct, committed footballand he was right. The result was their biggest upset since the famous 1-0 win over England in the 1950 World Cup finals in Brazil. The Belo Horizonte venue of that match is indelibly written into soccer's story, and Bloemfontein is likely to become just as famous for American f
