 Dhaka, June 27 (bdnews24.com)Suranjit Sengupta, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on law ministry, has said that Awami League general secretary Abdul Jalil criticism of the prime minister's advisers should be taken 'positively' He said the Section 70 of the constitution bars the MPs from giving their opinion, but the Awami League has overcome the obstacle, proving that the party is truly democratic. Jalil has taken the liberty to give his opinion, he added at a leadership orientation programme for the MPs on right to information at Hotel Sheraton on Saturday. Jalil in his speech on the proposed budget in the parliament on Thursday demanded the removal of the advisers as they had not sworn any oath of secrecy. He had also accused unspecified advisers of hampering the work of the government. "If they attempt to steer the cabinet, the proposed budget will not be implemented. Digital Bangladesh will never come true," said Jalil. A day later, an adviser to the prime minister slammed Jalil for the remarks. "He could have talked to the prime minister if he felt offended for not having a position in the cabinet. But this is not the way to speak," Alauddin Ahmed, who advises the prime minister on education, social development and politics, told reporters. bdnews2
