<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 25 (bdnews24.com)The government has decided to examine the final report of the 11 'sensational' cases over bomb attacks carried out from 1999 to 2007. "A four-member probe committee has been formed headed by a deputy inspector general of Criminal Investigation Department," home minister Sahara Khatun told reporters on Thursday after a meeting of the monitoring cell on sensational cases. The cases include bomb attacks on Ahmadiya mosque in Khulna, Awami League office in Bagerhat and a cinema hall in Sylhet. The final report, dropping charges, was submitted without naming any accused. Khatun said: "How could final reports be submitted in murder cases?" On whether they would re-investigate the Aug 21 grenade attack case, the minister said: "The court will decide on the matter." The prosecution on Thursday appealed for further probe into the cases over the grenade attack on an AL rally. bdnew
