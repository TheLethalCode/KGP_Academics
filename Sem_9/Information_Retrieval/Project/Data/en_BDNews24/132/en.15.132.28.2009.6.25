 LONDON, June 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Top seed Dinara Safina blasted her way into the third round at Wimbledon on Thursday with a 6-3 7-5 victory over Paraguay's Rossana De Los Rios. Safina, the world number one but still chasing her first grand slam crown, used a mix of powerful serving and superior groundstrokes to unseat the South American, ranked 99 places beneath her. The Russian took the opener in 35 minutes courtesy of a single break and another break was all she needed to wrap up the match in an hour and 22 minutes, sealing victory with a crunching backhand crosscourt winner. Safina will bid to reach the fourth round here for the first in her career against Belgium's Kirsten Flipk
