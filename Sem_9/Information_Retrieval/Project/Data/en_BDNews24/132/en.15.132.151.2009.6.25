<TITLE> WB questions money whitening policy </TITLE>

 Dhaka, June 25 (bdnews24.com)The government's policy to bring black money into the legitimate economy was unlikely to succeed, as similar attempts had failed in the past, a World Bank official said on Thursday. The plan to whiten black money in the proposed budget, by imposing a penalty tax, will not significantly raise revenue, said the Bank's senior economist in Bangladesh Zahid Hussain. The government is mistaken if it expects to collect a significant amount of tax in this way, said Hussain. He also said the World Bank could not support the proposal on ethical grounds. Although various countries offer the facility, it was unfair to honest tax-payers, he said. Briefing reporters on his evaluation of the proposed budget, Hussain said the government's offer to legalise undisclosed money through investment in crucial sectors, especially public-private partnership initiatives, was not likely to succeed either. He said he had come to these conclusions based on past observation. The scope to whiten money has been given before on nine occasions in Bangladesh, he said. Hussain said a total of Tk 18,000 crore had been whitened by different administrations to date, which earned the government revenue of just Tk 1,420 crore. More than half of the Tk 1,420 crore was realised during the two-year caretaker government's tenure. Many people whitened money out of fear over the last two years, said Hussain. Now there was a democratic government in Bangladesh, this fear had disappeared. Because of these factors, there was little reason for optimism regarding the money whitening offer, he said. bdnew
