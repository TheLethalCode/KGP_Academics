 Dhaka, June 25 (bdnews24.com)Foreign minister Dipu Moni has sought UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon's personal support for declaring Bangla an official language of the United Nations. She also asked for the UN's assistance for the trial of war criminals in Bangladesh. "The foreign minister sought the personal support and attention of the secretary-general for the effort of Bangladesh to declare Bangla as one of the official languages of UN and explained the backdrop," a foreign ministry press statement on Thursday. Dipu Moni met Ban Ki-moon Thursday at the sidelines of the UN conference on the global financial crisis and its impact on development. The statement said the foreign minister also discussed the trial of war criminals with Ban Ki-moon, at the UN's New York headquarters. It said Dipu Moni made it clear that her government was pursuing the trial of Bangladeshi war criminals only and had no intention to try any other nationalities who perpetrated war crimes during Bangladesh's 1971 Liberation War. She said the trial of the war criminals was one of the election pledges of the government. The foreign minister assured the trial of the war criminals would be of international standard. Dipu Moni nad Ban Ki-moon discussed the ways in which UN could assist the trials, the statement said. The foreign minister addressed the UN conference as the coordinator of the least developed countries group. Bangladesh is the current chair of the LDC Group. The statement quoted Dipu Moni as saying: "Though the global financial crisis had been created by the developed countries, it was the developing and the least developed countries which were hit the hardest." She told the conference LDCs should also be represented at the G-20 summit. "They should get a greater role in the administration of the international financial institutions." She sought the UN's support to secure Bangladesh's proper share of recession aid funds for developing countries, including that of G-20, said the statement.
