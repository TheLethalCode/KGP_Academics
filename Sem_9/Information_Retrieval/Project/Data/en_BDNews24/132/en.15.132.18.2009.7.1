<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 1 (bdnews24.com) A Dhaka court Wednesday held a partial hearing on a petition by state prosecutors for further probe into the Aug 21 2004 grenade attack on an Awami League rally. Speedy trial tribunal judge Md Masder Hossain set July 12 for the next hearing after lawyers for accused former deputy minister Abdus Salam Pintu appealed for more time. Lawyers for accused Arif Hossain Sumon were also present in Wednesday's hearing. Sumon's counsel Aminul Goni Tito told the court the prosecution did not file the petition complying with the law. The investigation officer was supposed to petition for further probe, not lawyers, he said. Chief state counsel Syed Rezaur Rahman filed the petition last month. The proceedings of the two cases, a murder case and an explosives case, are running concurrently. Some 61 among 412 witnesses have so far testified. The witnesses include president Zillur Rahman, prime minister Sheikh Hasina, home minister Sahara Khatun and AL general secretary Abdul Jalil. At least 23 people were killed, including party central leader Ivy Rahman, and scores of people were injured, including the then opposition leader Sheikh Hasina, in the deadly grenade attack on Bangabandhu Avenue. CID assistant police superintendent Fazlul Kabir pressed charges in the cases on June 11, 2008. The BNP-led four-party coalition government has been accused of attempting to derail investigations after the bombing through false witnesses statements. The CID accused 22 people in its charge sheets including BNP leader Pintu, his brother, also the alleged grenade supplier Maolana Tajuddin alias Taj, and Mufti Hannan, leader of banned Islamist outfit Harkatul Jihad. Of them, 13 accused including Pintu and Hannan are now behind bars while the remaining accused are on the run. bdne
