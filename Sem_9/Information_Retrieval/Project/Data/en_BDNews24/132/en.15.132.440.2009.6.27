 Nilphamari, June 26 (bdnews24.com)Activists of Jamaat-e-Islami and its front organisation Islami Chhatra Shibir on Friday captured a bazaar under Dimla Upazila in Nilphamari district, police said. Around 400 people led by Jhunagachh Chapani union Jamaat leaders Saiful Islam and Amzad Hossain captured the bazaar just after the Fazr prayers, shouting 'Allahu Akbar' slogan, said officer-in-charge of Dimpla Police Station Shawkat Hossain. He said additional police were deployed there. Shawkat said activists of Jamaat and its student front vandalised around 60 shops, looted goods, built some new shops and fenced some places with bamboo. Thana Nirbahi officer Mizanur Rahman, sub-inspector Moinul Islam, Union Parishad chairman Ekramul Huq Chowdhury along with the local elite asked them to leave the place, but they continued throwing up more shops. Nilphamari police superintendent Golam Rosul told bdnews24.com, "They have taken possession under the court orders. Police will take actions if anybody files case for the damages." Deputy commissioner Farhad Hossain said there was a legal fight between the government, and Saiful and Amzad over a piece of land in the bazaar, where the government lost. "So they captured the bazaar on Friday morning, which they cannot do." The Jamaat leaders could not be reached by phone for comments. bdnews24
