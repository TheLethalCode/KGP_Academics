 Dhaka, June 27 (bdnews24.com)Disaster management minister Abdur Razzaq has said the developed countries that are responsible for climate change blamed for more natural disasters should immediately be pressured to disburse the funds they had pledged. Razzaq said the developed countries promised to pay 0.7% of their national income, but none but one or two did so. Climate change is leading to global worming and increasing the frequency of cyclones, floods and draughts, the minister said at a seminar on 'Climate Change: Effect, Mitigation and Adaptation' at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh on Saturday. Civil engineering divisional committee of the IEB arranged the seminar. "As a disaster-prone country, we must follow the global recommendations to fight the situation immediately." "The government also decided to distribute 26 lakh tonnes of food grains in next fiscal year," he added. bdnews
