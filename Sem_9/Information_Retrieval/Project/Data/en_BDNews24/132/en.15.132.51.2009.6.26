<TITLE> Industrial park urges tanneries to shift </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 25 (bdnews24.com)  A top official at the new leather industrial park in Savar has urged tannery owners to start shifting their factories from Hazaribagh to the purpose built site, although a central effluent treatment plant has yet to be built. Shahidul Haque, project director of the 200-acre industrial park, told bdnews24.com: "We have told the tannery owners that everything is ready except the treatment plant." "But the relocation will inevitably take some time. So we want to start immediately," he said. Haque said the roads, drainage, power, water and all other infrastructure requirements were complete, and the plots were almost all distributed. "We asked them please start relocating your industries here from Hazaribagh," he said. Approximately 200 plots have been allocated to 154 tannery owners to date. On June 23, the High Court ordered all tanneries in Hazaribagh to quit the area by Feb 28, 2010. The court also ordered all industries to set up effluent treatment plants by June the same year. The 194 tanneries located in Hazaribagh pump tonnes of toxic chemicals into the Buriganga river every day. President of the Bangladesh Tanners Association, Shahin Ahmed, told bdnews24.com that their biggest problem was the banks' refusal to transfer existing mortgages to the new sites. He said the issue of compensation for relocation costs should also be considered, especially in light of losses to the industry due to global economic downturn. He said: "A High Court order is also pending on effluent treatment plants." "In any case, it will take at least another 15 to 18 months to build the treatment plant at Savar. So it is not possible to start shifting before these are resolved," said Shahin. Construction works on the 'Leather Industrial City, Dhaka' began in 2003. A tender was called for the construction of the CETP twice in 2006. A third tender was called in 2007 and two firms submitted bids. A Bangladesh-Singapore joint ventured WBDC, JV won the contract. But the government was forced to halt the deal on charges of forged documents. WBDC, JV in turn sued the government for cancelling the contract. Terms for the CETP were revised in 2007, saying that the cost of its construction would be collected from the plot owners through installments over a 20 year-period. The tanners association has objected, saying the government should bear the total cost. Asked whether it would be possible for factories to start production at the new industrial site without a CETP, if their relocation from Hazaribagh is completed by February 2010, Shahidul Haq said they would have to wait and see. "The High Court has ordered to treatment plants in every industry by June 2010," he said. "So, the decision would be taken after considering the situation at that time." bdnew
