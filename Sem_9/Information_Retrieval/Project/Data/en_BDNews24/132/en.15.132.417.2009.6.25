<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 25 (bdnews24.com)US ambassador James F Moriarty has suggested that Bangladesh hold dialogue with India to settle the dispute over construction of Tipaimukh dam in India. He, however, ruled out the possibilty of the US mediating to resolve the water disputes in the South Asian region. "I urge the people of Bangladesh, the government of Bangladesh to negotiate with India to settle this (Tipaimukh dam)," Moriarty told a discussion meeting on US president Barack Obama's South Asia policy. He made the comment as some audience drew his attention to the controversial Tipaimukh dam being constructed on the Barak river in India's northeast Manipur state. The US envoy said he did not have data on the flow of water coming from the upstream in India and the possible impact of the Tipaimukh dam for hydroelectric project. On the water disputes in South Asian region, Moriarty said, "Obviously that needs to be worked out through dialogue with the countries engaged". "We support South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation very strongly." He said his country had no stake in the row over waters in South Asia. On the planned war crimes trial in Bangladesh, Moriarty said Dhaka had not sought any "direct" help from the US government. He reiterated that the issue should not be "politicised" and the trial should meet international standards. Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies, a leading think tank on securities studies, organised the discussion meeting at city's BRAC Centre. The institute's president A N M Moniruzzaman presided over the discussion.
