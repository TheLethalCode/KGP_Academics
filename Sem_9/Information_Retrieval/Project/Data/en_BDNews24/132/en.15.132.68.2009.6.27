 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com)Former speaker Muhammad Jamiruddin Sircar has said he will appear before a parliamentary investigation committee probing graft allegations if it provided him the documentary evidence of any corrupt practices. The committee, on the other hand, has said Sircar will get the documents if he appears before it on June 27. The probe body, headed by ruling party MP Fazle Rabbi Mian, last week summoned Sircar, his deputy Akhter Hamid Siddiqui and former chief whip Khandker Delwar Hossain to attend its June 27 meeting to defend themselves against charges of corrupt practices during the eighth parliament. "As a former speaker and sitting MP, I feel that I must uphold the dignity, honour and prestige of parliament as it is an institution and an independent organ of the state," Sircar told the committee chairman in a letter obtained by bdnews24.com on Wednesday. "Therefore  I shall appear," he said. "However, in order to understand the purpose of the appearance, and to clarify matters, I need to see all the materials and documents which were considered by the committee and any other form of evidence that was presented with respect to the issues specified," said Sircar in the letter sent on June 22. "Therefore, I request that the committee provides me with all such documents and evidence for me to understand for clarifying the matters before the committee in accordance with the law." "If the committee does not provide me with the materials it considered, it would be clear to all that the committee is motivated and does not intend to give me a fair opportunity of being heard," it said. The investigation committee discussed Sircar's letter at a meeting in parliament on Wednesday with Fazle Rabbi Mian in the chair. The chairman did not talk to the press on the outcome of the meeting. But committee member Shajahan Khan told bdnews24.com after the meeting, "We have discussed his letter. We are dissatisfied with his letter which contained some objectionable words." "He will get the documents only after he appears at the June 27 meeting. "Otherwise, we will refer the matter to the House for subsequent actions," said Shajahan, the first to air the allegations in parliament against Sircar, who held the post of speaker from October 28, 2001 to January 25, 2009. The probe committee on June 21 sent a letter to Sircar asking him to clarify his past actions. The letter said that Sircar drew medical allowances without approval from the authorities, resorted to irregularities in appointing staff in the parliament secretariat and purchasing goods. It said the former speaker used more vehicles than his entitlement resulting in consumption of additional fuel, spent additional funds for parliament's beautification and failed to return the materials and equipment he took from the parliament secretariat. The letter further said Sircar extended the contract of parliament's cafeteria through irregular means. "All the allegations were vague and unspecified. So, I must see the records first to present my version," Sircar, a barrister, told bdnews24.com at his High Court office Wednesday. He reiterated in the letter that the probe body was constituted "illegally" with "malafide and ulterior motive". "The constitution of such a committee has undermined the office of the honourable speaker of the House of the Nation," the letter said. Speaker Abdul Hamid, in the face of strong demands by ruling Awami League MPs, formed an 11-member committee to investigate the allegations against Sircar, now a BNP MP elected from a Bogra seat.
