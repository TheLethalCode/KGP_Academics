 Dhaka, June 28 (bdnews24.com) The Tigers fly to the West Indies on Monday night hoping to put behind a disastrous World Twenty20 performance. It is Bangladesh's second tour since 2004 and Mashrafe Bin Mortaza's first assignment as captain. "As a captain, I will be hoping all of us will try their best though we did not play well in the World Twenty20, but we are still capable of doing better and if we show that in the first match it will help to regain our confidence," said Mashrafe during the pre-tour conference at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Sunday. "I want 100 percent from them whether we win or not," said the Bangladesh pace spearhead adding that the problem, however, was a lack of confidence. Mashrafe also promised to lead by example so that others could realise that Bangladesh are capable of competing. The Bangladesh new captain also advised his team-mates to talk to the West Indian players for at least half-an-hour to solve their individual problems. After Bangladesh's early exit from the World Twenty20, coach Jamie Siddons went back home to Australia to see the birth of his daughter and he attended the media conference after arriving on the same day. Siddons thought the wicket in the West Indies would suit his batsmen, medium pacers as well as spinners. "The wickets in West Indies will suit us as I have seen the past few home series. It will suit our batsmen, medium pacers and spinners. So there is plenty to look forward to on this tour," he said. Siddons also thinks Bangladesh is a hard side to captain and coach as well. "Bangladesh is a tough side to captain and coach as well. The captain does not have a (Shahid) Afridi to throw the ball to, doesn't have a (Sanath) Jayasuriya to go open the batting for him. No (Lasith) Malinga to bowl the last four overs. But this team has grown over time and that can be seen." Bangladesh have sweet memories of their first Caribbean tour. They drew the first Test against Caribbean with Habibul Bashar and Khaled Mashud striking centuries and Mohammad Ashraful hit 81 to help the side make 416 in the first innings of the first Test. Siddons, however, was not ready to say anything before the tour and said that the time and situation of two tours were totally different. Siddons also said he suggested to the board that Ashraful be relieved of the captaincy in order to concentrate on his batting. "I was the first person to propose to the board that Ashraful needs a break. Let's take the pressure off him. We all know what he is capable of and playing without the added pressure of captaincy will do him good," Siddons said, "Mashrafe is a good choice and a senior player who has performed well for Bangladesh in the past." Khaled Mahmud, who had supervised the Tigers' training in the absence of Siddons for two weeks, has been appointed the assistant coach and Siddons felt it was a positive step after the departure of his compatriot Sean Williams. "I lost my assistant coach Sean Williams a while ago and it's good to have another voice around. I need to know him more I have run into him in some practice sessions," assessed Siddons. Mahmud said that he had worked on the strong points of West Indies during the training camp and would now share those points with Siddons. The former Bangladesh captain, who is considered a good motivator, said if Bangladesh could play as a unit, then they would be able to put up a better performance on the tour. After the two Tests, three ODIs and a Twenty20 match against West Indies, Bangladesh will travel to Zimbabwe to play five one-day internationals from August 5-19 in Bulawayo.
