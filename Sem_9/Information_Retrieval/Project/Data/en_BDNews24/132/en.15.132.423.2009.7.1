 Dhaka, July 1 (bdnews24.com)  Former BNP minister Nazmul Huda and Jamaat-e-Islami assistant secretary general Md Kamaruzzaman face contempt of court charges for slamming last month's High Court ruling on the proclamation of independence. Supreme Court lawyer SM Zafar Ali filed the contempt petition with a High Court bench on Wednesday, accusing them of speaking against the court's judgement. The court on June 21 ruled that independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman proclaimed the independence of Bangladesh in 1971. The proclamation has been a contentious issue between the Awami League and BNP for decades, with the latter claiming their leader and former president was the one to declare independence. Petitioner Zafar Ali said that Huda and Kamaruzzaman had dishonoured the court by terming the judgement 'political' and 'motivated'. He filed the petition following reports in newspapers published on June 30, quoting the two opposition leaders. The High Court, earlier on June 24, charged former vice-chancellor of Dhaka University, Emajuddin Ahmed, with contempt after he spoke against the same verdict. Emajuddin said that High Court was running "a malign campaign". bdnew
