<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 29 (bdnews24.com)Agriculture minister Motia Chowdhury has proposed in the parliament that the government make dividends on savings certificates tax-free for all, not only for civil servants. Speaking on proposed budget for FY 2009-10 on Monday, the agriculture minister requested finance minister AMA Muhith to consider removing the apparent discrepancy. "The savings certificates earnings have been exempted from all taxes for the government officials and employees, whereas taxes have been slapped on the same profits earned by other citizens," said Chowdhury. "I would request the finance minister to waive such taxes for all." Speaking on the militancy, she, alleged that it was during the BNP-led coalition government's term that such menaces had emerged. Militancy arose during the BNP-led alliance rule and they had then conspired to render Bangladesh a failed state through rampant practice of misrule, corruption and resource plundering, she said. "Their conspiracy is still on in sectors such as the readymade garments. This government will foil and combat all conspiracies ensuring people's participation." The minister lauded the finance minister for his budget proposals for social security expansion, introduction of public-private partnership, use of information technology and other innovative approaches. She said it was a pro-growth budget. bdnew
