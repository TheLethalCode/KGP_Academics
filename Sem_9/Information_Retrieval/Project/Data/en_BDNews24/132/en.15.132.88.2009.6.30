 Dhaka, June 30 (bdnews24.com)The first-time MPs of the ruling Awami League on Tuesday shouted "yes" instead of "no" in the parliament on a vote on allocation of funds for the law ministry. Independent MP Fazlul Azim made a proposal to grant Tk 1 only for the ministry instead of Tk 464 crore proposed by the finance minister for the 2009-10 fiscal year. Deputy speaker Shawkat Ali put the proposal to voice voting. "Please say 'yes' who support the cut proposal made by Fazlul Azim and say 'no' who oppose," he told the House. The MPs, mainly women of the treasury bench, shouted "yes", befuddling Ali, who put the motion to vote again. Senior MPs including the chief whip then waved the others on to follow them before voting. All government MPs then shouted "no" at the top of their voice. The MPs then roared with laughter. bd
