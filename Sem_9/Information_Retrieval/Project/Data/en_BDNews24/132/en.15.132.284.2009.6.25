 Dhaka, June 24 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary watchdog on Wednesday recommended slashing the proposed new duty slabs on vehicles up to 2000cc. AHM Mustafa Kamal, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on the finance ministry, said the panel also suggested a similar cut in new duties on mobile phones and accessories in the proposed budget. "Considering people's purchasing capacity, we have recommended reducing the duties on reconditioned vehicles up to 2000cc, but not luxury vehicles. "Up to 2000cc means cars, small micro buses, pick up vans. Because, these are the vehicles used by the middle-classes," Kamal told reporters after the committee's meeting at parliament. But he said the committee had not recommended any specific new rates of duty on the vehicles. Finance minister AMA Muhith in his proposed budget for the upcoming fiscal proposed duty slabs between 45 to 350 percent on reconditioned vehicles. Vehicles up to 2000cc will incur 45 to 65 percent supplementary duty, finance ministry officials have said. The finance minister was present at Wednesday's standing committee meeting. The chairman said the finance ministry had agreed to implement about 90 percent of the recommendations made by the standing committee.
