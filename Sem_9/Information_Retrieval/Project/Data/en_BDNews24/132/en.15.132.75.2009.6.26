<TITLE> BNP-Jamaat going overboard on Tipaimukh dam: CPB </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 26 (bdnews24.com)The Communist Party of Bangladesh (CPB) has accused the opposition BNP and its key ally Jamaat-e-Islami of going overboard on the issue of India's controversial Tipaimukh dam project. "We will oppose the construction of Tipaimukh dam. But, we will have to counter the political intentions of BNP-Jamaat on this issue," CPB general secretary Mujahidul Islam Selim said at a roundtable on Friday. "The Indian high commissioner has said many untoward things about Tipaimukh dam and ridiculed our experts. We protest these. But BNP-Jamaat is going overboard," he said at the discussion on 'Tipaimukh DamNo, Asian Highway, ConnectivityYes" at the central office of the party in Paltan. They remain silent when the US and other Western diplomats talk about Bangladesh's internal issues. So their gung-ho attitude about Indian high commissioner Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty seems politically motivated, Selim said. The CPB leader said that if constructed, the Tipaimukh dam will sour the relationship between Bangladesh and India and the stubbornness of the Indian government will remain responsible for that. Besides, the comments of the ministers have further complicated the situation, he said. He endorsed Bangladesh's move to join the Asian Highway network project. "Only India and Bangladesh are not involved with the Asian Highway. It will connect the entire region. Everyone will have to take advantage of it." Researcher and writer Syed Abul Maksud alleged that the government was playing hide and seek with the people on the issue. "It seems that the government has some weaknesses for the dam. It seems that the government is trying to safeguard someone's interest," he said. He urged the government to specify their position on the issue in a week. "It can be said beforehand that the report to be submitted by the parliamentary committee being sent by the government to inspect Tipaimukh will not be to our liking," said Maksud. Abdul Matin, the general secretary of Bangladesh Paribesh Andolon, an NGO that works on environmental issues, said, "It will be nothing but a tour if the parliamentary party goes to Tipaimukh. Go to [New Delhi] instead and talk directly with the [Indian government]." He asked the government to display the design of the dam and make public the report on the possible impacts the dam in the upstream Borak River would have on the environment and on the people of both Bangladesh and India. He said if a social movement cannot be created on this issue then Jamaat will take advantage of it. "This issue should be solved politically," said Angikar Bangladesh chief Muhammad Hilal Uddin, calling for a unified movement of the leftist forces against the dam. "We will have to move ahead in the interest of the people of Bangladesh, not for the sake of opposing India," said CPB president Manzurul Ahsan Khan. b
