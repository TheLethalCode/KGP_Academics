 Dhaka, June 30 (bdnews24.com)Finance minister A M A Muhith told parliament on Tuesday that the government was doing all to check violence in the readymade garment sector, following days of rioting by workers at Ashulia. Muhith's comments came after independent MP Fazlul Azim urged the government to increase the home ministry's budgetary allocation to contain such violence and and maintain law and order. Azim referred to the burning of factories by demonstrators in Ashulia on Monday and said "terrorists" were involved in the three-day violence that left two people dead. "Over the years, the ready made garment sector has been plagued by violence," Muhith said. "We have also seen terrorists getting the shelter of the ruling party. "But we are aware of it. We will contain violence in the sector," said Muhith who sought funds for the home ministry for 2009-10 fiscal year in absence of the minister Sahara Khatun, who is ill. "We have granted necessary funds to maintain law and order in the country," said the finance minister. The parliament on Tuesday allocated Tk 5879 crore to the home ministry. The violence at Ashulia in Savar came to a head on Monday as angry apparel workers set ablaze a 10-storey building of Hamim Group in protest at the death of two co-workers in clashes over the previous two days. The ground and first floors that housed the sweater factory in the 10-storey building were burnt to ashes.
