 Chanpainawabganj, June 28 (bdnews24.com)Ghatak-Dalal Nirmul Committee (Ghadanik) convenor Shahriar Kabir has urged the government to begin war crimes trial right way, warning that a delay might put the entire affair in stake. "The parties or organisations opposing the independence war are needed to be tried along with the people who opposed freedom," he said at a discussion meeting at Chanpainawabganj on Sunday to mark former Ghadanik chief Jahanara Imam's 15th death anniversary "The government must begin the trials as soon as possible. Any delay in the process will render the process difficult and cumbersome. There are pro-BNP and pro-Jamaat people in the administration who will always meddle in the trials; the government will have to purge the administration of them, Kabir added. He alleged that Jamaat-e-Islami were still conspiring against independent Bangladesh. "Jamaat is conspiring to foil the war crimes trials." They are also busy trying to put up barriers to implementing the 1972 constitution. They are spending huge sums on production of anti-liberation materials and disseminate the same, he added. Independence war sector commander Abu Osman Chowdhury, Ghadanik central organising secretary Shafiqul Alam and freedom fighters Lal Mohammad and Rafiq Hasan Bablu also spoke, among others, on the occasion. Abu Osman Chowdhury said through the nation will be honouring Jahanara Imam, referred to as the mother of the martyred, most by holding the war crimes trials,. He called upon people to put pressure on the government to expedite the trials. bdnews
