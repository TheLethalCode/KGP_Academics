 TOKYO, Sun Jun 28, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japanese and South Korean leaders agreed on Sunday that Pyongyang's nuclear moves are unacceptable and said they will strengthen cooperation between each other and with regional powers to halt North Korea's nuclear ambitions. The meeting between Japan's premier Taro Aso and South Korean President Lee Myung-bak in Tokyo, where Lee was visiting for a day, came as the North has rattled the region with a nuclear test in May and with preparations to fire long- and mid-range missiles.

They also agreed senior officials of Japan and South Korea would meet on Wednesday to discuss the possibility of resuming stalled negotiations for a free trade deal. "If Japan and South Korea can understand each other's positions well, then I am positively thinking that an agreement may be reached at a surprisingly early period," Lee said. Japan and South Korea, key trade partners withe one another, launched negotiations for a free trade deal in 2003, but talks stalled a year later due to wrangling over tariffs, as pressures mounted in both countries to protect their farm sec
