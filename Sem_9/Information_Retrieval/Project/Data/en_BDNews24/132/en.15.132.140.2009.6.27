<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 27 (bdnews24.com)Foreign minister Dipu Moni has urged India not to go ahead with the controversial Tipaimukh dam construction until a Bangladesh parliamentary delegation visited the dam site. She has also proposed that a Bangladesh-India joint survey on the project as people were raising concerns against the hydroelectric project. The foreign minister made the proposal as she met with India's state minister for foreign affairs Preneet Kaur in New York, according to a foreign ministry press statement. She and Kaur are now in New York to attend a UN conference on global economic crises. Dipu Moni told Kaur that Bangladesh was banking on the Indian assurance that New Delhi would not do anything "detrimental" to Bangladesh's interest, the statement said. "She (Dipu Moni) proposed meeting of the Joint Rivers Commission and reminded the Indian state minister that joint assessment should be done of the project, as it was widely believed that this would harm the environment of Bangladesh," the statement said. The foreign minister also met her Chinese counterpart Yang Jiechi and discussed bilateral issues. The Chinese foreign minister thanked Dhaka for its support to "One China Policy" and the issues of Tibet crisis and human rights situation.
