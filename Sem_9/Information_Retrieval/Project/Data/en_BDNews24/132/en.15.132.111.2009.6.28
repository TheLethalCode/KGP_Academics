 Dhaka, June 27 (bdnews24.com)Information minister Abul Kalam Azad has said an independent Information Commission will be formed in four days, while a parliamentary watchdog chief said that the commission should not be turned into a club for retired judges and government officials. The Right to Information Act-2009, passed into a law in the parliament on March 29, comes into force on July 1. Eight intelligence and law-enforcing agencies were exempted, but all other public-funded agencies are obliged to reveal information to citizens. The commission should not be an "extension of bureaucracy", either, Suranjit Sengupta, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on law ministry, said at a leadership orientation programme for the MPs on right to information at Hotel Sheraton on Saturday. Azad said the names of the information commissioners from the ruling and opposition parties have already been sent to the president. Sengupta said it was a courageous move to make the law. "The civil society should play a vital role here, while the government and the opposition along with the journalists should be integrated for the success of the newly born law." Speaker Abdul Hamid said the execution of the RTI law is tougher than enacting the law. He said with dissemination of accurate information should be ensured. He cautioned that there may erupt social and political complications from the abuse of law. The speaker said the execution of the law is important for the protection of democratic environment and added that secrecy is the base of corruption in the government departments. Hamid hoped that the commission will be consisted of skilled, neutral and right persons to safeguard the people' fundamental rights. "Right information in the hand of political leaders and elected people's representatives can not only meet the people's interest but also prevent the corruption and the abuse of political power," the speaker added. bdnews2
