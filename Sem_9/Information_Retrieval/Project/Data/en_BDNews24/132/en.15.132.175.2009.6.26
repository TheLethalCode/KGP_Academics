 YANGON, Jun 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A UN special envoy to Myanmar will fly to the army-ruled country on Friday, a Foreign Ministry official said, a visit aimed at laying the groundwork for a possible visit by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The trip will be Ibrahim Gambari's eighth to Myanmar and he is expected to arrive as the widely-condemned trial of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi resumes in Yangon. "He is due to arrive here on Friday morning and as far as I know, he is scheduled to stay here only for two nights," the Myanmar Foreign Ministry official, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters on Thursday.

She is charged under Section 22 of a draconian law protecting the state from "subversive elements", but her lawyers say the charges should be dropped because the legislation is outdated. Yettaw and two of Suu Kyi's housemaids are also charged under the same law. Western diplomats at the United Nations last week said the junta had invited Ban to Myanmar. The diplomats, speaking under the condition of anonymity, said Ban was concerned the regime would use the visit for propaganda purposes to try to legitimise Suu Kyi's t
