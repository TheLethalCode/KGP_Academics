 LONDON, June 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former England captain Michael Vaughan will attend a news conference on Tuesday, the England and Wales Cricket Board said in a statement on Sunday. There has been speculation that the 34-year-old was poised to announce his retirement with newspaper reports saying he was ready to quit after failing to win a place in England's preliminary squad for this year's Ashes series. Vaughan enjoyed his finest hour in 2005 when he led England to a long awaited Ashes victory over Australia on home soil and he was the world's top-ranked batsmen in 2003. He has struggled with a succession of injury problems in recent years, playing the last of his 82 tests in 2008.
