 Dhaka, June 26 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court on Friday sent to jail Hussain Al Masum, executive director of the illegal banking outfit Jubo Karmasangansthan Society (Jubok). Metropolitan magistrate Tofail Hasan rejected his bail prayer after the hearing, general recording officer of the court Abdul Haque, also sub-inspector of police, said. Police arrested Masum on Thursday on charges of fraud. He had nine arrest warrants out against him in separate cases, Shah Jalal, sub-inspector of Paltan Police Station, told bdnews24.com. Jubok originally enlisted as a 'society' under the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies, but then began running unlicenced banking operations, allegedly amassing around Tk 1000 crore from around 25,000 depositors over the years. On May 24, 2006, Bangladesh Bank served a notice on Jubok asking it to explain why its activities such as receiving deposits and borrowing money from the public on interests should not be declared illegal. The central bank found the outfit guilty of illegal banking in July 2006 and directed it to repay Tk 100 crore it owed the depositors by Dec 31 that year. Thousands of those depositors are still waiting for their money. Other top Jubok officials have also been charged with cheating customers. Police arrested Jubok Housing chairman Lokman Hossain on May 5 this year in connection with at least eight counts of fraud and embezzlement. bd
