 Dhaka, Jun 25 (bdnews24.com)Awami League general secretary Abdul Jalil voiced criticism of the prime minister's advisers in parliament on Thursday, and demanded their removal from cabinet meetings. Jalil also said the ruling AL, his party, was in the doldrums. "The party, which led all democratic movements, has become stagnant. It must rouse itself," he said during his speech to the House on the proposed budget. Regarding the prime minister's advisers, he demanded their removal as they had not sworn any oath of secrecy. "The prime minister can appoint advisers. But they cannot sit at cabinet meetings. The ministers have sworn secrecy, they have not." Jalil accused unspecified advisers of hampering the work of the government. "If they attempt to steer the cabinet, the proposed budget will not be implemented. Digital Bangladesh will never come true," said Jalil. bd
