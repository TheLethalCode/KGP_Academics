<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 29 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has said the problems posed by the controversial Tipaimukh dam project by India could be resolved through bilateral discussion . "I believe I will be able to resolve the problem through bi-lateral discussions." She accused the main opposition BNP of making an issue of Tipaimukh dam in her speech on the proposed budget in the parliament on Monday. Opposition chief Khaleda Zia earlier in the day sent a list to the prime minister containing names for a six -member representative team to visit the dam site.. Hasina said, "I have heard of a letter being sent to me before coming here. I do not know what it is, but I will go through it." "Every problem needs everyone's assistance," she added. "Our opposition party is now aware of the Tipaimukh dam, but they were silent when the project was launched. A parliamentary committee team will visit Tipaimukh dam and we would like to have BNP representatives in the team." She suggested a slash in the proposed import duty on newsprint, motorcycle, low-price mobile-phone sets, cars under 1500cc and microbus under 2000cc. "Newspapers have developed into an industry now, no matter they write in favour or otherwise. So, I would request the finance minister to reconsider the duty." Finance minister A M A Muhith Muhith was present. Muhith on June 11 proposed to impose 5 percent duty on newsprint in the budget for the fiscal year 2009-10. "Car is a luxury, but you may revise the imposed duty on those that the middle-class uses. Please reduce duty on cars under 1500cc On the provision for whitening black money, Hasina said, "Many are criticising the scope to whiten money, even those who have done so. They have taken care of their needs. Why is that?" She said the trend of legalising undisclosed money and default on loan payments had started from the time of president Ziaur Rahman. "It cannot end overnight... It is not possible until corruption is eliminated." Hasina said new schools will be set up where there is no school. Monitoring will be introduced to ensure proper education and elected representatives will have to answer for that The prime minister declared a separate commissions for pay and appointment of teachers. The prime minister gave her speech on the proposed budget for one and a half hours, starting at 4:27pm. Speaker Abdul Hamid chaired the session. On the opposition's boycott of the parliament, she said the opposition leader is not coming to the parliament over the seating arrangement dispute which is not related to the public interest. "I cannot understand this." She asked Khaleda to leave her cantonment house and stay in the Gulshan residence. The prime minister said that the government would not control the Anticorruption Commission and that it would work freely. The caretaker government took initiatives against corruption but it failed when it mixed politics with it, she observed. Hasina said the proposed budget was a reflection of the election manifesto of her Awami League party. "Rural economy will be developed if this budget is implemented. Within 2014, one person from each family will be given job." She said export overall increased 12.8 percent this year under her government, though export of a few products declined. The prime minister spoke of the 'corruption, looting and transfer of money abroad' during the 2001-2006 term of BNP-led coalition government. Likewise, the 2007-08 caretaker government scared all and the administration came to a standstill. She, however, appreciated the interim government for holding a fair election on a digital voter list and a strong Election Commission. The prime minister also announced a separate job commission for teachers and building a software industry in the country. She said her government has put special focus on women empowerment. "There are five 'woman' ministers in the cabinet along with the deputy leader in the parliament. Participation might increase further. More party nominations will be given to women," she added. The prime minister described the initiatives her administration has taken for the freedom fighters and said, "Bangladesh is free because of those fighters. We will do everything for them." Hasina said trial of the war criminals will definitely take place. "We have even allocated money for the procedure." bdnews24.
