<TITLE> Ivanovic to use past lessons in Venus clash </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, June 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former French Open winner Ana Ivanovic will draw on lessons from her last Wimbledon clash with Venus Williams when she plays the five-time champion on Monday for a place in the quarter-finals. The 21-year-old Serbian, who marched past Australia's Samantha Stosur 7-5 6-2 on Saturday to secure a meeting with Williams, said she had learnt a lot from playing the world number three in the semi-finals two years ago.

Venus and sister Serena, who faces unseeded Daniela Hantuchova on Monday, are firmly on course for a repeat of their 2009 clash in the final and are characteristically stepping up a gear with each round. But Serena, who won the last of her two Wimbledon crowns six years ago, is not expecting her bid to reach the quarter-finals to be an easy ride. "She is such a smooth player and she takes her time on the court," said Serena. "I have to make sure I don't rush myself because she is playing well... so I'm going to have to really bring a tough ga
