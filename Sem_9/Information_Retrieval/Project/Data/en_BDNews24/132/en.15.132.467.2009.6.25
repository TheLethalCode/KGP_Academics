 Dhaka, June 25 (bdnews24.com)  Hussain Al Masum, head of the illegal banking outfit Jubo Karmasangansthan Society (Jubok), was arrested on charges of fraud Thursday, said police. Masum had nine arrest warrants out against him in nine separate cases, Shah Jalal, sub-inspector of Paltan Police Station, told bdnews24.com. Jubok originally enlisted as a 'society' under the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies, but then began running unlicensed banking operations, allegedly amassing several crore taka from around 25,000 depositors over several years. On May 24, 2006, Bangladesh Bank served a notice on Jubok asking it to explain why its activities such as receiving deposits and borrowing money from the public, offering interest, should not be declared illegal. The central bank found the outfit guilty of illegal banking in July 2006 and directed it to repay Tk 100 crore owed to depositors by Dec 31 that year. Thousands of those depositors are still waiting for their money. Police arrested Masum in Motijheel at around 4:30pm Thursday, said Shah Jalal. Other top Jubok officials have also been charged with cheating customers. Police arrested Jubok Housing chairman Lokman Hossain on May 5 this year in connection with at least eight counts of fraud and embezzlement. bdnews
