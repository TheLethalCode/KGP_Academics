 Dhaka, June 29 (bdnews24.com)A Bangladesh-Japan joint venture has offered to generate 1,000 MW of power by installing environment-friendly windmills in Bangladesh. "We are ready to utilise the latest wind-generated power production technology. The government now has to assist us,". Jun Tsutsumida, chairman of BJ International, said at a press conference at Hotel Sonargaon on Monday. Mustafizur Rahman, the managing director of the company, said they had a research report which said windmills in Bangladesh could very well generate 1,000 MW electricity. BJ International also announced their plans to get involved in drug manufacturing and hospital construction in the health sector. The other plans include enhancement of crop production through improving soils, providing assistance in chemicals-free preservation of agricultural produces including fish, vegetables and fruits, and their exports, providing consultancy services and improved technology to trade and finance organisations and also servicing the telecommunication sector. The joint venture aims to start with energy-saving bulbs, digital security and video conference appliances and other IT products, Rahman said. "On July 1, we'll formally launch our commodity supply services with energy-saving bulbs, the latest digital security systems and video conference appliances," said the MD. Ro Shogen, the vice president, said different types of energy-saving bulbs will be imported first and after feeling the pulse of the market here, they planned to go for assemblage or production plants. About the prices of these bulbs, he said prices of their commodities will be about the same as others available in Bangladesh. But their bulbs will guarantee much longer lifeabout five to seven times more than those in the market, he claimed. Tsutsumida, the company chairman, said they wanted to do business in Bangladesh for three years without taking profits out. "We won't take our profits back as other business people do. We'll do good business for three years, the capitals will buildi up and then we'll think of new business plans to invest the profits," said Tsutsumida, also the chairman of IT firm Jun International and Self International, a health sector enterprise. b
