 By Shihab Uddin Kisslu, from New York New York, June 27 (bdnews24.com)Foreign minister Dipu Moni has stressed the need for friendly relationship with India and said the data provided by the Indian government on the controversial Tipaimukh dam will be made public once a parliamentary committee examined them. "It is necessary for Bangladesh to maintain friendly relations with the neighbouring countries, particularly India, for development and maintaining peace," the minister told bdnews24.com on Friday at the Bangladesh mission to the UN in New York. She attended the June 24-26 United Nations conference on the world financial and economic crisis and its implications on development. The foreign minister said the extradition treaty with India was under discussion. She said that she had discussed the issue of war crimes trial with UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon and other officials. The government has no problem with controversial writer Taslima Nasrin, now living in exile in India, returning home, but her security issue is to be considered by the home ministry, she said. On the allegations of diplomats meddling in the internal affairs of Bangladesh, Dipu Moni said journalists sometimes created a situation where the diplomats happened to make unwarranted comments. "The blame not only goes to the reporters, the politicians and diplomats are also equally responsible," she said. The minister observed that militancy was not only a problem of Bangladesh alone but of the whole region. She was confident that Bangladesh would be able to deal with the aftermaths of the global recession if the situation did not worsen. "Many more workers have gone abroad compared with the number of workers who have returned home. The media should highlight the issue." Dipu Moni said the government was always searching for new labour markets. On unconfirmed media reports of the appointment of former army chief Moeen U Ahmed as Bangladesh's ambassador to the UN, she said she did not have any information about that. She was due to return home on June 30
