 KATHMANDU, June 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nepal confirmed on Monday its first cases of H1N1 flu virus, in three members of a family who had returned from the United States, the Himalayan nation's health ministry said. The three -- a 44-year-old man, his 38-year-old wife and their eight-year-old son -- arrived in Nepal last week from Washington, where they spent eight months, said Raj Kumar Mahato, an epidemiologist with the government's Department of Health Services. "We had some suspicion when they arrived at the airport. After necessary investigation they tested H1N1 positive," Mahato told Reuters. "All three are getting necessary treatment in an isolation ward in a hospital in Kathmandu," he said without giving further details. Authorities said they were trying to find details of the family's transit routes before coming to Nepal.
