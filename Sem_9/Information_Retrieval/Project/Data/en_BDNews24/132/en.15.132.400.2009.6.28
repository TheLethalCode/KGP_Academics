<TEXT>
 Rangpur, Jun 28 (bdnews24.com)An indefinite strike by interns at Rangpur Medical College Hospital rolled into the second day on Sunday, leaving scores of patients to suffer without treatment. "No doctor came to see me since morning," said Mamtaz Ahmed, a patient at the surgery ward. Two employees of the hospital's medicine ward, Solaiman and Abdul Motabel, said none of the interns were working. The president of the Intern Doctors Association of the college, Pintu Kanti Das, said the strike would continue until their demand was met. Pintu claimed that nurses and fourth-class employees of the hospital supported the strike. However, acting director of the college Anisul Karim said the patients were not suffering due to the strike. Karim said initiatives have been taken to resolve the problem. Interns and general students of the medical college enforced the strike on Sunday afternoon after an attack by "a group of criminals" on 'Imran', former president of the association on the campus on Saturday. The protesters on Sunday laid a seize to the director's office and took out processions demanding arrest and punishment of the attackers. They also demanded security. Additional police force has been deployed at the college premises. bdne
