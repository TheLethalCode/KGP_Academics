 JOHANNESBURG, Jun 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Holders Brazil fought back from 2-0 down with three second-half goals to beat the United States 3-2 and win the Confederations Cup for the third time in an entertaining final Sunday. The US., who shocked Spain in the semis, looked set to complete an even greater upset when goals by Clint Dempsey and skipper Landon Donovan put them 2-0 ahead at halftime. US goalkeeper Tim Howard produced several good saves before striker Luis Fabiano took his tournament tally to five just after the restart and he equalized with a header. Brazil captain Lucio completed his side's stunning recovery when he rose superbly to power home an Elano corner six minutes from time. The match was a fitting climax to an outstanding tournament which provided shocks, excellent football and noisy crowds, auguring well for next year's World Cup finals in South Africa.

Brazil had the majority of the possession but rarely threatened until a minute after the restart when Luis Fabiano turned and shot through the legs of a defender in one movement. Brazil twice went close to an equalizer, Howard pulling off an excellent diving save from a Lucio header and getting lucky when Kaka's downward header looked to have crossed the line before the keeper held on to it. But he was not quite as fortunate the next time Brazil hit the bar. Kaka accelerated past Spector on the left before crossing to Robinho on the six-yard line. He first time shot came back off the bar to Luis Fabiano who headed in the rebound. Brazil were now in command and the decisive breakthrough came when Lucio rose to power the ball home with a his head
