 BISHKEK, June 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kyrgyzstan's parliament on Thursday unanimously approved a deal with the United States to keep open the only US air base in Central Asia. A total of 75 deputies voted for the agreement in the 90-seat parliament, with none voting against. Five deputies abstained. The United States has agreed to pay $180 million to Kyrgyzstan to keep open the Manas air base, a key refuelling point for U.S. aircraft in NATO operations against Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan. Washington had been haggling to keep the base open since February, when the former Soviet republic announced its closure after securing pledges of $2 billion in aid and credit from Russia. A Kremlin source said Wednesday the deal to keep the base open had been agreed with Moscow.
