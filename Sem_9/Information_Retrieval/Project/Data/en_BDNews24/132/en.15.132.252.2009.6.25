 Dhaka, June 25 (bdnews24.com)Workers of Gazi Fashion in Hatkhola blocked Hatkhola Road on Thursday morning protesting non-payment of salary arrears, police said. Police later cleared the road at 10am and the agitated workers took position at the Central Shaheed Minar. Sutrapur police chief Tofazzal Hossain told bdnews24.com that Gazi Fashion workers had not been paid since May. The factory owners assured them of clearing their wages for May-June on June 30. But the workers arriving at the factory at 8:30am today (Thursday) found the gate locked, he said. Then they put up barricades on Hatkhola road which caused serious traffic gridlock in the area. Police then intervened, moved the pickets away and cleared the road. The agitated readymade garment workers subsequently moved to the Central Shaheed Minar and staged a sit-in there. bdnew
