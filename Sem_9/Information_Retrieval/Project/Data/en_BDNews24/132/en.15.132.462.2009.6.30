 Dhaka, June 29 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has suggested a slash in the proposed import duty on newsprint, motorcycle, low-price mobile-phone sets, cars under 1500cc and microbus under 2000cc. "Newspapers have developed into an industry now, no matter they writes in favour or otherwise. So, I'll request the finance minister to reconsider the duty," she said during a budget discussion in the parliament on Monday. Finance minister A M A Muhith Muhith was present. Muhith on June 11 proposed to impose 5 percent duty on newsprint in the budget for the fiscal year 2009-10. "Car is a luxury, but you may revise the imposed duty on those that the middle-class uses. Please reduce duty on cars under 1500cc On the provision for whitening black money, Hasina said, "Many are criticising the scope to whiten money, even those who have done so. They have taken care of their needs. Why is that?" She said the trend of legalising undisclosed money and default on loan payments had started from the time of president Ziaur Rahman. "It cannot end overnight... It is not possible until corruption is eliminated." bdnews24.
