 KABUL, Fri Jun 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tens of thousands of Afghans gathered in central Kabul on Friday to support President Hamid Karzai in the first big rally to be held before elections on Aug. 20. Thousands of people, many of them ethnic Hazaras who once opposed Karzai, spilled into the streets after the rally in a sports stadium. Only months ago Karzai, who has ruled Afghanistan since the Taliban was ousted following a US-led invasion in 2001 and who won the country's first direct vote for president in 2004, had seemed beatable and was perceived as weak in the face of a growing Taliban insurgency. The election is seen as a crucial point for both Karzai's Western-backed government and for Washington, which has put Afghanistan and Pakistan at the top of its foreign policy agenda and is pouring in thousands of extra troops this summer. But Karzai has managed to consolidate his position in recent weeks by winning the support of some of his key former rivals, especially from minority ethnic groups, and dividing the rest of the opposition. Karzai is from the majority Pashtun ethnic group and chose as vice presidential running mates former guerrilla leader Mohammad Qasim Fahim, once a leading opposition figure and a Tajik from Afghanistan's second-largest ethnic group, and former vice-president Karim Khalili, an Hazara. UNFLATTERING Official campaigning for the election kicked off 10 days ago. Friday's gathering in Kabul was the biggest rally to date and was organised by an Hazara group known as Paiwand Milli, or National Unity. Karzai's election campaign manager said 30,000 people had gathered at the stadium to show their support. An unflattering report by the International Crisis Group think tank this week said poor security and failure to capitalise on gains since the 2004 poll and strengthen state institutions meant widespread fraud was possible in the voting. Some of the Hazaras noted past criticism of Karzai for leading a weak government, growing insecurity and widespread but unproved allegations of corruption, but said there were few realistic alternatives. "People say Karzai did not do us any good in the past seven years but he will in the future," said Mohammad Hassan, holding a picture Karzai in his hand. "Now Karzai knows what to do. If someone else replaces him it will take many years to learn what Karzai has already learnt." Fahim, who led US-backed Afghan forces which toppled the Taliban's strict Islamist government, spoke at the rally. Karzai's choice of Fahim as a running mate raised eyebrows because he has been linked to human rights abuses and corruption. An opinion survey by a US-based group published last month gave Karzai a wide lead, with 31 percent support as the most popular choice of voters for president. His main rivals among the list of 40 challengers, former foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah and former finance minister Ashraf Ghani, could both attract only single-digit sup
