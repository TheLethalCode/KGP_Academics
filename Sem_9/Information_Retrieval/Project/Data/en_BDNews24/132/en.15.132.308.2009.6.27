<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jun 27 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina was fed poisoned food while she was in prison during the 2007-08 military-installed caretaker government, a private TV station quoted a senior Awami League leader as saying on Saturday. "The leader (Hasina) fell sick having taken the poisoned food and her mouth was swollen. But she never gave in to (pressure)" deputy leader of the parliament Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury said at a programme in the capital. At a discussion marking the birth anniversary of slain national leader AHM Quamaruzzaman in the capital, Sajeda said the prime minister still gets occasional bouts of illness due to the damage caused by the poisoning. Awami League chief Hasina was arrested on July 16, 2007 by the Fakhruddin Ahmed-led interim government on a slew of graft charges and was freed on June 12 next year on bail. Her party says she had been under intense pressure to quit politics and live in exile. Hasina and her arch rival, BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, who was also arrested, were kept in makeshift prisons in the parliament complex. bdnew
