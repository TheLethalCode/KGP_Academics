 Dhaka, June 30 (bdnews24.comTurnover on the Dhaka Stock Exchange touched a new high at Tk 942 crore on Tuesday, a day after a hoax bomb threat shut trading an hour earlier than the scheduled and on the day of budget passage. This is fourth time this month that the daily transactions have leapt to a new height. Authorities had halted transactions at 1:15pm and then evacuated the building on Monday after the bomb threat was made over phone by an anonymous caller that the stock building will be blown off soon. The caller said that a bomb had been kept inside the building. Turnover crossed the Tk 800 crore mark on June 21, surpassing the previous high of Tk 781 crore billion on June 7.
