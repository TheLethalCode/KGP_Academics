 MADRID, June 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rafael Nadal was left out of Spain's Davis Cup squad on Tuesday for their World Group quarter-final against Germany. The world number one has been struggling with tendinitis in his knees since being knocked out of the French Open last month and was forced to miss Wimbledon. Spain captain Albert Costa called up Fernando Verdasco, Tommy Robredo, David Ferrer and Feliciano Lopez for the match on clay in the Puerto Banus bullring in Marbella on July 10-12.
