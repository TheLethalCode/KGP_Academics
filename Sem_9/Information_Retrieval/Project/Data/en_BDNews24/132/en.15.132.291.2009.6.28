 Dhaka, Jun 28 (bdnews24.com)A secretary-level committee mandated to suggest ways to implement the seventh pay commission recommendations for civil servants could not finalise a report on Sunday, three days to the deadline. The report needs the go-ahead from the prime minister for government officials to get a pay hike from July. "The recommendations may be finalised in the next meeting on July 1," cabinet secretary Abdul Aziz, head of the committee, told bdnews24.com on Sunday after a meeting of the committee. Aziz on June 22 had told bdnews24.com that they would submit the recommendations to the prime minister's office by June 30. Aziz said on Sunday that his committee had recommended reduction of the highest pay ration of 11.25:1, suggested by the commission, to less than 10:1. In line with the pay commission recommendations, the lowest salary will be set at Tk 4000, but the highest salary will be lowered to a "logical level" to avoid any major disparity. bdnew
