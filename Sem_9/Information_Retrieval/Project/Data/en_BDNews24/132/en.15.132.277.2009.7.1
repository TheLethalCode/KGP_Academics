<TITLE> Bus strike hits South </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 30 (bdnews24.com) - Private bus operators in the south called an indefinite strike Tuesday on 33 routes in four districts, Khulna, Bagerhat, Pirojpur and Jhalakathi, to press home five demands. BTRC buses were moving on the routes as usual under the tight security of police and no untoward incidents were reported on the day, but thousands of people suffered from the lack of public transport as BTRC barely meets the demands of the public on the routes. The Coordinated Owners-Workers United Council formed called the strike to press demands that include prevention of "irregularities" in the transport sector, banning informal public transport, such as Nasiman and motorcycles, and opposition to BTRC buses. The bus operators also demanded withdrawal of cases against officials of Jhalakathi and Bagerhat Bus-Minibus Owners Association. Barisal so far has been out of the strike as they said operators in the district fix their programme after July 8. Barisal bus owners associations will sit in talks with the communications ministry on the day, they said. bdnews24.
