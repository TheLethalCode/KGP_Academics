 Dhaka, Jun 26 (bdnews24.com)--Vested interest groups in the administration are one of the barriers to implementation of the government's vision of having a Digital Bangladesh by 2021, speakers observed at a post-budget discussion on Friday. Emphasis on bridging the digital divide in the country have been also suggested at the seminar titled' Contribution of the Proposed Budget in Building Digital Bangladesh', organised by Dhansiri Communications Ltd. Finance minister AMA Muhith attended as the chief guest of the seminar. IT specialist Mustafa Jabbar said in his keynote presentation that the government should have to go digital first in the way it goes about its business. "That would be the base for a Digital Bangladesh." He identified local government, education, agriculture, industry and commerce as the most important sectors in need to be digitised. Jabbar urged the minister to withdraw VAT on internet usage, saying it contradicts the government's vision. He also asked for governmental measures to facilitate online credit card transaction in a bid to introduce e-commerce. The proposed budget for FY 09-10 has no clear guidelines on network computerisation, rules of business and development of human resources for a digitised Bangladesh, he added. Former caretaker government adviser Akbar Ali Khan told the seminar that a "vested interest group" in the government always act as an obstacle to e-governance. "These quarters should be dealt with strictly or else, implementation of e-governance would not be possible." Ex-finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said that the government needed to be careful about the digital division that might arise. "We have to be conscious that a non-digital Bangladesh does not erupt in parallel with the digital Bangladesh." Finance minister AMA Muhith said that a guideline on digital aspects is on the cards. On e-commerce, he said the security arrangement was not sufficient in Bangladesh for introduction of online credit card transactions. "We are not equipped enough to protect the consumers' information." Citing e-governance as the most important component for a digital Bangladesh, he said the government would do its best to establish it within its tenure. On the crucial issue of duty on mobile phone and SIM cards, he said whatever necessary would be done.
