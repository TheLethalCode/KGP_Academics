 Dhaka, Jun 27 (bdnews24.com)The killing of three men by gunmen in Karwan Bazaar on Friday and a garment worker in Savar on Saturday are 'stray incidents' that do not mean a slide in law and order, the home minister has said. "Law and order is improving in the country. Incidents in Karwan Bazaar and Savar are sporadic and such things will be happening," Sahara Khatun said. "Despite limitations in the police department, we are trying to further improve the situation," the minister said at a programme at BGMEA office in Dhaka, where the apex apparel traders' body presented two pick-up vans to Gazipur police. She sought assistance from the businessmen and industrialists saying that the government equipped with limited resources was struggling to work for the people. Sahara highlighted the shortcomings of the police, saying that they do not have adequate manpower and vehicles. The patrol cars often stop on the roads chasing the criminals. "What will they do then, fix up the car or chase the criminals?" The minister urged the BGMEA o contribute more pick-ups to help police work more efficiently. BGMEA president Abdus Salam Murshedi said law and order has improved with fewer numbers of extortions, abductions and other crimes. "Some sporadic incidents are still taking place. Extortion cases have reduced but not stopped. Many businessmen do not speak in fear, they prefer to remain silent." Murshedi urged the minister to take steps to stop "silent extortion" and demanded constitution of 'industrial police' force to ensure highest security at the export-focused readymade garment factories. bdnews2
