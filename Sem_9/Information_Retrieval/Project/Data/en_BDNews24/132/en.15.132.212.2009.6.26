The court also told the BRTA to install corresponding devices at its traffic control rooms to monitor speeds. The government was directed to organise recruitment and training necessary to implement the measures. The bench of justices ABM Khairul Haque and Momtaz Uddin Ahmed reissued the directives as an original order, issued in December 2007 with a deadline of March 10 last year, was not followed.
