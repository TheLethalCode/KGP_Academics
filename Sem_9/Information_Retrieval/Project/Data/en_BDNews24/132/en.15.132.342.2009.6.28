<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 28 (bdnews24.com)  Community policing can play an effective role in eliminating religious terrorism, the visiting British minister of security and counter terrorism has said. A big reason for concern is the young people's involvement with the fundamentalist groups, Lord West told reporters after visiting the police headquarters on Sunday during his three-day Dhaka tour. He put emphasis on hitting the roots of religious terrorism and said that only arrests cannot deter the terrorists. Protecting human rights is a big issue in containing terrorism, he added. The minister sympathised with the families who lost their loved ones to the militant attacks. He said organisations like Al Qaeda are soiling the image of a great religion like Islam. Additional inspector general (admin) of police Naba Bikram Kishore Tripura was with him at that time. In the morning, he and state minister for foreign affairs Hasan Mahmud signed a memorandum of understanding to form 'joint working group' of Bangladesh and United Kingdom through which UK will assist in eliminating terrorism. Bilateral activities, besides working internationally, will help more, West observed. b
