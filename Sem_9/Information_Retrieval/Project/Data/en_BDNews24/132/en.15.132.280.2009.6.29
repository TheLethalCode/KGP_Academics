<TITLE> EC awaits speaker's reply on SQ Chy's fate </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Pabna, Jun 29 (bdnews24.com)The Election Commission is waiting for the reply to its letter from the speaker to decide on the fate of BNP MP Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury, an election commissioner said on Monday. In line with a court ruling, the EC sent a letter to speaker Abdul Hamid asking him to take measures against opposition MP Chowdhury for supplying 'false information' about his educational credentials. In a press briefing in Pabna, Sohul Hossain said, "We'll take next step as soon as he [the speaker] answers the letter." Chowdhury had said that he studied law in London and again he said he had studied in Karachi. And his parliamentary biography reads that he studied at Notre Dame College in Dhaka, Hossain pointed out. "Chowdhury took five months from the commission to collect these certificates, but he has yet to give the facts although the deadline ended on May 31." The EC accuses Chowdhury of violating Section 12 3 (b) of the Representation of the People Order by concealing information about his qualifications. According to the RPO, a candidate for parliamentary elections must divulge specific information, including education, in an affidavit along with nomination papers. Flouting of the rules give grounds for cancellation of candidacy even after election to parliament, says the law. The EC says Chowdhury, a graduate, submitted that he had no degree, and failed to correct the information given despite an extended deadline and a High Court order. Chowdhury, however, has argued that supplying educational credentials is only "a matter of disclosure" and failure to do so does not amount to dismissal as a sitting MP, according to constitutional law. bdnews2
