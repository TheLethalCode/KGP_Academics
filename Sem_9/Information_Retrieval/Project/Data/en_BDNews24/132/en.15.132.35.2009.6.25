<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 25 (bdnews24.com - The High Court has ordered the government to accurately demarcate Dhaka's river system within four months, to protect the boundaries of the city's major rivers. It has ordered the work to start no later than July 1. The court served a number of directives on the government Thursday in a bid to safeguard the ecologically threatened Buriganga, Turag, Shitalakhha and Balu rivers, which circle the capital. It directed the deputy commissioners of Dhaka, Narayanganj, Gazipur and Munshiganj to demarcate the river boundaries, to prevent encroachment, after carrying out Cadestral Surveys. The court also ordered the environment secretary to declare the four rivers 'ecologically critical zones'. It ordered the continued demolition of illegal structures encroaching the four rivers. The directives follow a petition by non-government organisation Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh. bdne
