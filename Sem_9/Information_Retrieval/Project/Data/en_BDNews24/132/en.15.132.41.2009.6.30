<TEXT>
 LONDON, June 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Third seed Venus Williams stayed resolutely on course for a third successive Wimbledon title with a 6-1 6-2 victory over Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska in their quarter-final on Tuesday. Venus, seeking her sixth career title here, has not lost a set at Wimbledon since the 2007 third round and the 11th seeded Radwanska rarely threatened a shock on a sun-kissed Court One. "She's such a great grasscourt player, she plays the ball so low and plays so quick. I was happy to get through," Venus said in a courtside interview. "I can't complain, the semi-finals at Wimbledon is right where I want to be." At the prospect of a fourth Wimbledon final against sister Serena on Saturday, she said: "That would be fantastic, something I am hoping for, of course." Venus raced to the first set in 27 minutes and though the Pole broke early for a 2-0 lead in the second, the seven-times grand slam winner reeled off six straight games, clinching victory with a forehand winner after an hour and eight minutes. She will play top seed Dinara Safina of Russia or unseeded German Sabine Lisicki for a place in Saturday's final.
