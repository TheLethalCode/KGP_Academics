 Dhaka, June 30 (bdnews24.com)The High Court on Tuesday stayed jail sentences in three graft cases against former minister Anwar Hossain Manju. The bench of justices Md Abdul Wahab Miah and Md Abdur Razzaque gave the order after hearing out the petition submitted by the ex-minister. On May 6, Manju surrendered in the court and submitted a prayer seeking bail. The court rejected his bail petition and ordered him into jail. However, he was freed on June 3 on bail. Special Judge's Court-10 on Aug 26, 2008 sentenced Manju to 13 years in jail on twin charges of amassing wealth illegally and concealing wealth related information. Earlier, Manju had been sentenced in two separate cases of bribery and illegally hoarding narcotics to five and seven years in jail. The verdicts were given in his absence during the 2007-08 caretaker government's term. b
