<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Sunday granted bail to former prime minister Sheikh Hasina in the Bangabandhu Memorial Trust graft case and halted the proceedings of the case under emergency rules. Hasina filed a writ appeal with the High Court bench of Justice Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Justice Zubayer Rahman Chowdhury on Oct 28, challenging the case. The judges issued a rule on the Anticorruption Commission and the government, asking them to explain in eight weeks why approval for bringing the case under the emergency rules would not be declared illegal. In the ruling, the judges also said the investigation of the case would continue. The case filed with Tejgaon Police Station on Sept 2 alleged that the accused had taken Tk 3 crore in "donations" to Bangabandhu Memorial Trust for approval to set up three barge-mounted power plants. ACC deputy secretary SM Sabbir filed the case against seven people including Hasina, former energy secretary Towfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, former Power Development Board chairman Nuruddin Mahmud Kamal and Summit Group managing director Muhammad Aziz Khan. The case alleged the accused had misused power and colluded with one another to sign an agreement with Wartsila Power Development to install the three power plants, instead of selecting the lowest bidder. The case was taken under the emergency powers rules on Sept 20. The writ petition said that putting the case under the emergency powers rules violated the law. bd
