 TEHRAN, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thousands of Iranians chanted "Death to America" and vowed not to yield to US pressure over Iran's nuclear programme at a demonstration on Sunday marking the 28th anniversary of the seizure of the American embassy. Students burned the Stars and Stripes outside the leafy compound in downtown Tehran that once housed the US mission stormed by radical students on Nov. 4, 1979, almost 10 months after the US-backed shah left into exile. "The crowd shows that pressures from abroad cannot weaken our national will and Islamic unity," said Abdollah Salehi, a 22-year-old Tehran University student. "Sanctions will not lead to any result."

Interior Minister Mostafa Pourmohammadi said the crowd had gathered to "pay homage to this great and glorious event" of the takeover in which 52 Americans were held for 444 days. In a speech, he said Iran would not give up its atomic programme. Some teenagers, however, were enjoying time out from class. "It's worth coming just to be out of school for a couple of hours," said Alireza, 15, who only gave his first name. Bahman, 14, playing on the sidelines of the crowd with some schoolmates, said he had been brought by this teachers. Some of the student leaders who took over the US embassy are now among Iran's most liberal pro-reform politicians. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a leader of one student faction 27 years ago, at first opposed the US embassy seizure. He proposed taking over the Soviet embassy instead, leading hostage-takers s
