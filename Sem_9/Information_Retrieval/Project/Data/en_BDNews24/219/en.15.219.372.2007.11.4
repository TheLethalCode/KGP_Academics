Parliamentarian Saleh Ashour told al-Anba that Humaidhi's resignation was verbal.

Humaidhi, a former finance minister, took the oil portfolio in a broad cabinet reshuffle a week ago, but deputies critical of his past performance immediately opposed his appointment. Islamist MP Dhaifallah Buramia submitted a request to question Humaidhi last month after a newspaper suggested he had made administrative and financial mistakes as finance minister. Kuwait's ruler, Emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, who has the last say in politics, addressed the reopening of parliament after the summer break last week and told deputies and the government to work together.
