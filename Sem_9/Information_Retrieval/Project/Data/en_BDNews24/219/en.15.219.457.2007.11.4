 ISLAMABAD, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police detained hundreds of Pakistani opposition figures and lawyers on Sunday as military ruler President Pervez Musharraf tried to stifle the outcry over his imposition of a state of emergency. Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz said national elections, due in January, might be rescheduled because of General Musharraf's decision on Saturday to announce emergency rule, which was condemned by the United States and other Western allies. "If you look at Pakistan's constitution, when you have an emergency, the parliament could give itself more time, up to a year, in terms of holding the next elections," he told a news conference. Musharraf has also suspended the constitution. Across the country, opposition figures were detained after Musharraf announced his decision, and Aziz said between 400-500 people were being held in preventive detention. He declined to say how long the state of emergency would last. Musharraf said he acted in response to rising Islamist militancy in nuclear-armed Pakistan and what he called a paralysis of government by judicial interference. Most Pakistanis and foreign diplomats believe his main motive was to prevent the Supreme Court invalidating his Oct. 6 re-election by parliament while still army chief. Musharraf, in a midnight televised address, said the country was in grave danger of becoming destabilised. "I cannot allow this country to commit suicide," he said after purging the Supreme Court of judges opposed to him and rounding up lawyers. The United States, which regards Musharraf as a crucial ally against al Qaeda in Pakistan and neighbouring Afghanistan, had earlier urged Musharraf to avoid taking authoritarian measures. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said on Sunday Musharraf must affirm that elections will take place. "It is in the best interests of Pakistan and the Pakistani people for there to be a prompt return to the constitutional course, for there to be an affirmation that elections will be held for a new parliament and for all parties to act with restraint," Rice said during a visit to the Middle East. CHIEF JUSTICE FIRED Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, suspended eight months ago by Musharraf and reinstated in July, was fired after refusing to take a fresh oath following the suspension of the constitution. Pakistan Television said that the cabinet, national and provincial assemblies would continue to function and that Abdul Hameed Dogar had been appointed as new Chief Justice. A lawyers' movement that emerged at the vanguard of an anti-government campaign last March called for a countrywide strike on Monday to protest Musharraf's move. Veteran Islamist Qazi Hussein Ahmed, leader of the opposition religious alliance, called for street protests to overthrow "the military dictator", during a speech to 20,000 followers on the outskirts of Lahore. Pakistan's English-language newspapers were unforgiving of the draconian measures that included a ban on any coverage "that defames, and brings into ridicule or disrepute the head of state" on pain of up to three years' jail. "General Musharraf's second coup," was Dawn's headline. A text message circulated on mobile phones provided a satirical take on Musharraf's emergency proclamation. "Suicide attack on the constitution, judiciary and media. The victims died, the bomber survived." There were no troops or large numbers of police on the streets of Islamabad or other main cities -- Karachi, Lahore or Peshawar -- though the detentions were conducted in all of them. Barricades blocked the main boulevard to the presidency building in Islamabad, where police arrested 40 opposition activists including a former chief of the army's Inter Services Intelligence agency, Hameed Gul, a supporter of Islamist causes. A leader of exiled former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's party voiced defiance as he was detained in Multan, a major city in Punjab province. "People will win. Generals will lose. They have to surrender," Javed Hashmi told reporters. WAVE OF ATTACKS Musharraf, who took power in a coup eight years ago, said he still planned to move Pakistan to civilian-led democracy. He had been promising to quit the army and become a civilian leader if he was given a second five-year term, but uncertainty over the court's decision had left the country in suspense and stock markets fell last week amid the uncertainty. Pakistan's internal security has deteriorated sharply in recent months with a wave of suicide attacks, including an assassination attempt on former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto last month that killed 139 people. In July, Musharraf ordered troops to storm the Red Mosque in Islamabad to crush a Taliban-style movement based there. At least 105 people were killed in the raid and a wave of deadly militant attacks and suicide bombings followed in which more than 800 people have been killed. Bhutto flew back to Pakistan on Saturday from a brief visit to Dubai and accused Musharraf of imposing "mini-martial law" in a move to delay elections "by at least one or two years". Another leading opposition figure, former cricket captain Imran Khan, was put under house arrest, but escaped hours lat
