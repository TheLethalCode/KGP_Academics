 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)  Acting Awami League chief Zillur Rahman told the Election Commission Sunday that releasing party chief Sheikh Hasina from jail was necessary for free and fair elections. He demanded that the state of emergency be withdrawn without delay. "You have yourself said that it would be best if the emergency was withdrawn well before elections," Zillur said to chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda. "We think the emergency must go right now," he said. The AL advocated banning "anti-liberation forces and religion-based political parties" from contesting polls. The AL delegation said it asked the commission not to display a "controlling attitude" during party registration. Huda said the Awami League was not just a political party, but a "torchbearer of independence". "You were the torchbearers of independence. You formed the Mujibnagar government and led the liberation war. So you must aid in development and advancement," the CEC said. Zillur led an eight-member team to the meeting that started at 10:45 am at the commission secretariat in Dhaka's Sher-e-Bangla Nagar. Party presidium member Tofail Ahmed said the basis of discussions was a 31-point charter of demands placed in 2006 by Sheikh Hasina before the administration of Khaleda Zia. Hasina had made the demands on behalf of the 14-party alliance, but the Khaleda administration did not adequately respond to it, he said. The CEC and colleagues Sakhawat Hossain and Sohul Hossain were at the meeting. Asked whether the AL had forgiven war criminals, Zillur said, "Bangabandhu did not forgive the murderers, rapists, arsonists and looters of the liberation war." "Some 22,000 war criminals were in jail during his tenure. Ziaur Rahman released them after taking power." Tofail said: "The commission agrees with many of our proposals. We will assist the EC in implementing the roadmap." "We spoke to the EC under these circumstances: our leader remains behind bars, and general secretary Abdul Jalil has been detained." The CEC said: "We are talking with all political parties on electoral law reforms. The commission wants to finalise a law acceptable to the parties." The reform proposals placed before the EC included legal bars on candidature of former government functionaries for at least three years after retirement, declaring NGO officials ineligible for polls, using transparent ballot boxes and cancelling the commission's proposed 'no' vote. bdnews24
