 ROME, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Torino held AC Milan to a goalless draw in Serie A on Saturday as the European champions misfired again in front of their home crowd. Milan, who are seventh with 14 points from 11 games, have not won a league game at the San Siro since April. Alberto Gilardino, who scored twice in Wednesday's 5-0 rout of Sampdoria, wasted two excellent chances laid on by Clarence Seedorf in the first 20 minutes. Kaka hit a right-footed shot just wide from outside the area in the 31st and Torino keeper Matteo Sereni saved a powerful Andrea Pirlo effort just before halftime. Torino's David Di Michele, playing for the first time after serving a three-month ban for illegal betting, gave the home side a scare with an angled effort in the 51st. Milan had a shout for a penalty denied shortly afterwards when Cesare Natali barged Massimo Ambrosini over in the area. Another Pirlo shot whistled past the left post in the 63rd minute and Filippo Inzaghi fired into the side netting when clean through on goal in the 78th but the dogged visitors hung on for a draw. Earlier, unbeaten Fiorentina won 1-0 at Lazio to go second with 23 points, one behind leaders Inter Milan, who travel to fourth-placed Juventus on Sunday. Striker Giampaolo Pazzini pounced on a blunder by Lazio's 43-year-old keeper Marco Ballotta, who let go of the ball as he tried to stop a back header going out for a corner in the 19th minute. Lazio, who had midfielder Massimo Mutarelli sent off in stoppage time for a second yellow card, are just two points above the relegation zone after suffering their third consecutive league defeat
