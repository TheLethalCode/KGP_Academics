 ATHENS, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Benjamin Kiprotech led a procession of Kenyans to victory in the Athens Classic Marathon on Sunday and Russia's Svetlana Ponomarenko won the women's race in a course record time. Running much of the race in light rain, Kiprotich broke away at the 35-km mark to complete the course in two hours 14 minutes 23 seconds, ahead of his compatriot Hosea Kiptanui. Kenyans filled eight of the top 10 positions. Ponomarenko finished in 2:33:44, a record for the event which largely follows the ancient route from the town of Marathon that gave its name to the race. Marathon was the site of a battle in 490 BC when the Athenians defeated the Persians and, according to legend, the runner Pheidipidis ran into Athens to deliver the news. The event was introduced to the first modern Olympics in Athens in 1896. Former double world marathon champion Abel Anton said he believed every elite runner should make a point of running the Athens race at least once. "Athens is one of the greatest marathons in the world because it is the original," said the 41-year-old Spaniard who won his first world championship in Athens in 1997. "It is historic and it has atmosphere. Athens must be one of the targets of every runner whether they are club runners or elite. At least once they must do it.
