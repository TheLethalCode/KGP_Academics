 LONDON, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Pervez Musharraf's imposition of emergency rule in Pakistan drew international condemnation on Saturday, with key ally the United States saying it was "deeply disturbed" by the move. Musharraf deployed troops, shut down privately-run television stations and sacked a top judge, saying the action was needed to counter rising militancy and a hostile judiciary. In a televised address Musharraf, who seized power in a bloodless coup in 1999, appealed for understanding from the international community. However, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called the measures "highly regrettable" and urged that parliamentary elections planned for January should be held. "The US has made very clear that it does not support extra-constitutional measures as they would take Pakistan away from the path of democracy and civilian rule." Britain, the former colonial ruler and which has a large Anglo-Pakistani community, echoed the US view. "It is vital that the government acts in accordance with the constitution and abides by the commitment to hold free and fair elections on schedule," Foreign Secretary David Miliband said. "We hope the strong communities in the UK of Pakistani origin will also use their contacts through family and business to make the case for democracy and the rule of law." Violence in nuclear-armed Pakistan, viewed as a bulwark in the US's "War on Terror" after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, has risen sharply in recent months with a wave of suicide attacks by al-Qaeda-inspired militants. "MINI-MARTIAL LAW" Former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, whose return from self-imposed exile last month triggered a suicide attack that left 139 dead, accused Musharraf of declaring "mini-martial law" and vowed her party will seek to overturn it. The emergency rule was designed to postpone parliamentary elections for "at least one to two years", she told Sky News. Musharraf was elected president last month by parliament but could not take up the appointment until the Supreme Court ruled on whether he could legally be elected president while still remaining head of the army. The Commonwealth Secretary-General said he was concerned at the action by a member state. "The suspension of the country's Constitution days before the Supreme Court was due to pass judgment on General Musharraf's re-election as president is a matter of deep concern to the Commonwealth. It is a step in the wrong direction and a serious setback to democracy," Don McKinnon said. Initial reaction from neighbour India, with which Pakistan has fought three wars, was relatively muted: "We regret the difficult times that Pakistan is passing through. We trust that the conditions of normalcy will soon return permitting Pakistan's transition to stability and democracy to continue," its Ministry of External Affairs said. Farzana Shaikh, Pakistan expert at London's Chatham House thinktank said Musharraf may have gone too far. "I wouldn't be surprised if the US felt that perhaps General Musharraf had outlived his usefulness" "This decision was taken in clear defiance of the U.S. and the UK and for many inside the Bush administration might well be regarded as a slap in the face." Husain Haqqani, director at the Center for International Relations at Boston University, agreed. "Musharraf has overplayed his hand. He risks dividing an already polarized nation further. In the past, generals have suspended the constitution to remove from power unpopular rulers. This is the first time an unpopular ruler has suspended the constitution to save his position."
