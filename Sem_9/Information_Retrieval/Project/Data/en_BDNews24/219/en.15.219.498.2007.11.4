 Dhaka, Nov 04 (bdnews24.com)  World Bank president Robert Zoellick Sunday said procurement, transparency and government rules must be done properly to avert harsh conditions tagged by the lending agency for assistance. Zoellick made the comments after a civil society group asked the WB president not to attach tough conditions with WB's lending progarmmes to Bangladesh. "Since Bangladesh is a client and partner of the World Bank, we don't want that our money is stolen," Zoellick told reporters at Radisson Water Garden Hotel after a series of meetings with businessmen, civil-society representatives and media people. "I am here to listen and learnto know Bangladesh's priority and its principle and what they want to do," he said. "Bangladesh has to ensure that right policy is taken," Zoellick, a former US Trade Representative (commerce minister), told reporters. Prof Wahiduddin Mahmud as a representative of the civil society group told reporters after the meeting that they had asked the WB president not to tag tough conditions to the aid package. "There should not be any conditions to give aid for development," Prof Mahmud said. He said: "We ourselves can undertake policy decisions and don't need conditional policy supports." Zoellick said his primary purpose of the visit was to listen and learn from the country. He had meetings with the chief adviser, finance adviser, investors, private-sector representatives and civil society. "Bangladesh is doing well in many areas, including millennium development goals," he remarked. But he believed the country has much more potential to export further. Some institutional policy reforms, including anticorruption and energy reforms, are needed, Zoellick emphasised. He said the country needs more investment in agriculture, rural development and energy sectors. "We (WB and Bangladesh government) are trying to work together in these areas," he said. Replying to a question on Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus' demand to bring reforms to WB's policies, he said WB needs reforms and it is "going through reforms continuously". He cited that the Bank has increased its amount of international development assistance (soft loan) to $3.5 billion from only $1.5 billion since he assumed charge of the bank. Zoellick became the 11th president of the World Bank Group on July 1. The civil society group also told the WB president that the Bank's policy had harmed the country's jute industry and asked him to address the issue. Earlier, a group of selected businesses -- pharmaceuticals, aviation, telecommunication, food, leather, education and agro-based industries met with the WB president at Radisson. "We've sought help from the WB to improve the country's infrastructure," Abdul Muktadir, managing director of Incepta Pharmaceuticals, told reporters. A group of editors, including Mahfuz Anam of The Daily Star, Mahbubul Alam of The Independent and Reazuddin Ahmed of the News Today met the WB president. Zoellick leaves Dhaka Sunday night for Berlin. He visited Bangladesh as part of his trip to South Asia. bd
