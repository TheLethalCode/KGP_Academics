<TITLE> Indonesian volcano Kelud spews ash -official </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JAKARTA, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indonesia's Mount Kelud spewed ash about 500 metres into the air early on Sunday, a top volcano official said, a day after confusion over whether the mountain had already started erupting. Umar Rosadi, a scientist monitoring the volcano, told Reuters there had been constant tremors from the 1,731 metre (5,700 foot) mountain in East Java, while the temperature of its crater lake had risen sharply. "Technically, the condition today is more critical than yesterday," Rosadi said. Officials at Indonesia's Centre for Vulcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation said on Saturday that the volcano had erupted while hidden by heavy cloud cover, but late on Saturday they said that an eruption had not in fact taken place. The authorities have been monitoring the volcano for several weeks and raised its alert status to the highest level about two weeks ago as its activity increased and an eruption appeared imminent. An estimated 350,000 people live within 10 km (6 miles) of the volcano, which is about 90 km (55 miles) southwest of Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city. When it last erupted in 1990 at least 30 people were killed. Indonesia has the highest number of active volcanoes of any country, sitting on a belt of intense seismic activity known as the "Pacific Ring of Fire".
