 BERLIN, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany's GDL train drivers' union said on Sunday it wanted an improved wage offer from rail operator Deutsche Bahn [DBN.UL] or it would stage strikes on freight services as early as Tuesday. A German court on Friday gave the GDL permission to extend stoppages to long-haul and freight routes, overturning a prior ruling and setting the stage for more crippling walkouts. GDL deputy leader Claus Weselsky told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper union leaders would meet on Tuesday or Wednesday to assess the situation and strikes on goods services could begin immediately after. "For the time being we want to spare customers on local services, who have been seriously affected recently," he said. The GDL union, which represents some 34,000 drivers, says its workers are underpaid compared with counterparts elsewhere in Europe and is seeking pay rises of up to 31 percent and an independent collective labour agreement. It has rejected a deal for a 4.5 percent wage hike struck between Deutsche Bahn and two larger rail unions and refused a separate offer which Bahn says amounts to a 10 percent wage hike and a one-off payment of 2,000 euros ($2,896). The drivers have staged sporadic walkouts for months which have caused delays and disruption for millions of passengers. Transport Minister Wolfgang Tiefensee has warned that further strikes could have a disastrous impact on Europe's largest economy and industry groups urged Deutsche Bahn and the GDL to quickly restart talks to find a compromise. August Ortmeyer, a transport expert at the DIHK chambers of industry and commerce, told NDR it would be difficult for firms to shift transport of goods to road routes in the event of a strike as there was little reserve capacity. Deutsche Bahn, a transport and logistics giant with interests across Europe, Asia and the Middle East, is Germany's largest employer. It transported 1.85 billion passengers last year and brought in revenues of 30 billion eur
