<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 03 (bdnews24.com) Supreme Court registrar Iktedar Ahmed Saturday said that another 391 judicial magistrates would be appointed by February. The registrar told bdnews24.com: "At present, 201 judicial magistrates have been appointed from the judicial cadre and 16 others have been brought from the executive branch on deputation." "More magistrates will be appointed by February," he said. Replying to a question, Iktedar said court sub-inspectors will remain there to handle criminal cases for the state in magistrates' courts. No public prosecutors, additional or assistant PPs or other government counsels or lawyers will be appointed to the magistrates' courts, he added. Iktedar said: "From now on, the general recording officers (GRO) will keep records of the criminal cases' primary hearings." Asked how the newly appointed 10 judicial magistrates will manage the work of 25 executive magistrates, the registrar said the assistant judges will be appointed to the magistrate's courts during the yearly one-month court vacation in December. "It will solve the problem," he said. The registrar hoped that work would go on in full swing if helped by the police, lawyers and administration. bdnews24.c
