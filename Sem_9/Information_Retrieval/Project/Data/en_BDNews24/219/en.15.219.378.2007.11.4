 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)  Speakers at a gathering at the National Press Club Sunday called on the government to observe a Constitution Day and made calls to uphold the spirit of the constitution. Five of the 34 members of the constitution draft committee attended the discussions to mark the 35th anniversary of the promulgation of the constitution. The speakers also strongly demanded the inclusion of basic aspects of the constitution in secondary school curriculums. They said several amendments to the constitution during periods of dictatorship had eroded the secular nature of the state's basic law. Dr Kamal Hossain, who was chairman of the constitution draft committee, called for a strong "national will" to uphold the spirit of the constitution. "A constitution is the basic document of a country and cannot be changed to serve the interests of a vested group," he said. "The Bangladesh constitution is secular and non-communal and is based on the spirit of the liberation war." Dr Kamal said Sheikh Mujibur Rahman wanted the country's constitution to enshrine people's values and protect their fundamental rights. Supreme Court Bar Association President Barrister Amirul Islam, also a member of the constitution draft committee, denounced the rise of communalism in the country, saying secularism was one of the state's founding principles. "Mixing religion with politics is a real impediment to the exercise of a people's democratic rights. Our basic objective in drafting the constitution was to establish an orderly government, and uphold basic rights through the practice of democracy," Islam said. Awami League presidium member Suranjit Sengupta said: "The original character of the constitution which upheld secularism must be restored without compromise." "Let us be united to restore the spirit of the original constitution which has been mutilated," Sengupta said. Former AL information minister Prof Abu Sayeed said, "The constitution was written in the blood of martyrs. We were able to deliver the constitution to the people in the shortest possible time because we were united." bdnew
