<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)  Acting Awami League chief Zillur Rahman in talks with the Election Commission said Sunday that freedom of Sheikh Hasina was a must for a free and fair election. Zillur made the comment at the start of the meeting on electoral reforms and also demanded withdrawal of the state of emergency without delay. "You said the emergency must be lifted well ahead of the election," Zillur said to chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda. "We think the emergency must go right now," the AL leader said. The party also said it wanted a ban on war criminals and religion-based political parties to stop them from taking part in the polls. Also, it suggested that the commission should not show a "controlling attitude" during registration of the political parties. In the beginning of the meeting, Huda said the Awami League was not only a political party, but a torchbearer of independence. "You are the torchbearer of independence (of the country). You had formed the Mujibnagar government, led the liberation war. So you have to bear the responsibilities of the country's development and advancement." The crucial meeting started at 10:45am at the commission secretariat in the city's Sher-e-Bangla Nagar area. Zillur led an eight-member team to the talks. Party presidium member Tofail Ahmed, prior to the meeting, said that the basis of their discussion would be a 31-point charter of demands placed in 2006 by Sheikh Hasina before the administration of Khaleda Zia. Hasina had announced the demands on behalf of the 14-party alliance but the then Khaleda administration did not take them into account. bdnew
