 Khulna, November 4 (bdnews24.com)  A Khulna court Sunday granted police to question detained city mayor Sheikh Tayebur Rahman for five days in their custody in a case involving charges of extortion. Khulna chief metropolitan magistrate Mahbubur Rahman approved the remand prayer after police investigator Enamul Huq wanted a 10-day remand. Tayebur was in the dock but stood silent when the magistrate made his decision. But his lawyers insisted in the court that their client was innocent. Gulshan police in Dhaka late Friday arrested the mayor at his home on charges of corruption after a suspended official of the city corporation filed a case, accusing the mayor of taking Tk 2.90 lakh from him. Otherwise, the complainant said, the mayor had allegedly threatened to halt his promotion. bdnews
