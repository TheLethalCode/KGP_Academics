 ANKARA, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Eight Turkish soldiers, kidnapped last month by Kurdish guerrillas, were released in northern Iraq on Sunday in a move which could ease public pressure on Turkey's government to launch a major cross-border incursion. The release of the soldiers came a day after the Iraqi government vowed to hunt down Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants responsible for cross-border raids into Turkey, in an effort to avert a Turkish military response. Washington has urged NATO-ally Turkey not to carry out a major offensive, fearing it could destabilise northern Iraq and escalate into a bigger regional crisis. President George W. Bush is due discuss the standoff with Turkey's Prime Minister Tayyip Ergogan in Washington on Monday. "The eight soldiers in question returned (to) the Turkish Armed Forces on Nov 4," the chief of staff said on its Web site. Turkish TV said the soldiers talked to their families on phone after landing in Turkey. In response to what it sees as foot-dragging by the Iraqi government and the United States, Turkey has mustered 100,000 troops on the border with Iraq and threatened to go after the PKK if nothing is done to rein them in. Turkey wants leaders of the PKK arrested and the closure of camps in northern Iraq which they have used as bases for cross-border attacks in their 23-year campaign for a homeland in southeastern Turkey. The Turkish government stepped up pressure on Baghdad to act against the PKK after it killed at least 12 soldiers and captured eight others in an attack on a Turkish army post near the Iraqi border last month. Abdul Rahman Chaderchi, a senior PKK member, said the eight soldiers were in good health and were released in Iraq without ransom or conditions. "At 7.30 the eight Turkish prisoners were delivered to a delegation from the Kurdistan region which also included members of the Democratic Society Party (DTP)," he told Reuters. The soldiers were flown from the northern Iraqi city of Arbil to Turkey on Sunday. The PKK last captured and then released a Turkish soldier in 2005. "The soldiers were very happy because they are going back home," Turkish lawmaker Osman Ozcelik, in northern Iraq as part of a pro-Kurdish DTP delegation, told broadcaster CNN Turk. Turkish TV said U.S. officials played a role in the release and showed footage of the soldiers in vehicles after they were handed over. DIPLOMATIC PRESSURE An escalation of separatist violence in recent weeks and the capture of the soldiers sparked a huge public outcry in Turkey and calls for an offensive against the militants based in northern Iraq. Major powers and countries in the region, at an Iraqi security conference in Istanbul on Saturday, said the Turkish-Iraqi crisis must be solved by diplomacy. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice visited Turkey to seek to avert a major incursion into northern Iraq as well as to pressure Iraqi authorities to do more to clamp down on the PKK. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said on Saturday his Baghdad government would do all in its power, with the help of the northern Iraqi regional government, to end the PKK threat. While Maliki's government has little influence over the semi-autonomous Kurdish region in the north, intense diplomatic pressure may have convinced Iraqi Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani to put pressure on the PKK, diplomats say. In northern Iraq, a Kurdish official said on Saturday the regional government had shut down the offices of a political party which sympathises with the PKK. The PKK wanted to deliver a message with the release of the soldiers, Chaderchi said. "We want Turkey to release our president Abdullah Ocalan," he said. Another PKK official told Kurdish Firat news agency that the release was to help boost dialogue with Turkey. Ocalan is serving a life sentence in prison on an island in Turkey's Sea of Marmara. The PKK is considered a terrorist organisation by the United States, Turkey and the European Union. Nearly 40,000 people have been killed since the PKK took up its armed struggle for Kurdish self-rule in southeast Turkey in 19
