The case accused Moni and the others of stealing corrugated iron sheets used as a building and roofing material that had been allotted as relief, bdnews24.com's Barguna correspondent reports. Barguna additional sessions judge Shahjahan Majumdar handed down the verdict, which in addition to a 14-year jail term, fined the four accused Tk 5,000 each. The convicts have to serve another year in prison if they fail to pay the fine. The other three convicts are Saiful Islam Jamal, brother of the ex-MP and general secretary of Patharghata upazila BNP unit, BNP leader Shamsuddin Shanu, and Sramik Dal leader Jamal Hossain. The judgment was delivered in the absence of the convicts. The former lawmaker has been on the run since the promulgation of emergency rule.

The upazila project implementation officer, Abdul Qayyum, filed a graft case against the convicts with Patharghata Police Station the same day. bdnews2
