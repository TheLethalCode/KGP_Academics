<TITLE> Bhutto says Musharraf imposes "mini-martial law" </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KARACHI, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Pakistan prime minister Benazir Bhutto described the imposition of emergency rule by President Pervez Musharraf on Saturday as "mini-martial law" and vowed that her party will protest against it. "We condemn this martial law. We will protest it," Bhutto said in a news conference in the southern city of Karachi a little over an hour after arriving back from Dubai, where she had been visiting her family. Bhutto had been negotiating with Musharraf over Pakistan's transition to civilian led-democracy and had been allowed to return from self-imposed exile last month without fear of prosecution in old corruption cases thanks to an amnesty granted by the president.
