 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)  The home secretary Sunday said legal action would be taken against suspects who had made false or misleading statements after charges were pressed in the terrorism cases. Abdul Karim told reporters despite important strides in investigating cases after militant kingpin Mufti Hannan's confessional statements, nothing had yet been done against suspects who misled investigators. The home secretary was speaking to reporters after an inter-ministry meeting on the progress of investigations into "sensational cases". Investigations into the bomb blasts at CPB rally in Paltan, grenade attacks at Ramna Batamul, the Aug 21 attack on an AL meeting and a church bombing at Baniachong had made significant advances, he said. Karim said steps were being taken to try Yaba and 'Molom Party' cases in the speedy trial tribunals. Police had been asked to send a proposal upon which the government would later decide, he said. The meeting also discussed the issue of medical doctors testifying in cases. The home secretary said summonses for doctors would be sent to the deputy secretary (administration) to the health ministry and director (administration) of the health directorate to verify the doctors' code number. Karim said the meeting reviewed the progress of 10 cases that were included in the previous meeting. Two new cases had been included in the monitoring cell's list, he added. They are the Amit Hasan Khan Raja abduction case and the murder case of singer Nasir Srabon. The meeting reviewed progress made in investigations into the murder of Chandpur teacher Lokman Hakim, the murder of NSU faculty Rahat Karim Mukul, the murder of Jhalakathi's PP Haider Hossain, the grenade attack on Sylhet mayor Badruddin Admed Kamran, the grenade attack on AL leader Suranjit Sengupta at Sunamganj, the murder of journalist Belal in Shatkhira, the murder of DU teacher Humayun Azad, the murder of Dhaka businessman Humayun Kabir, the murder of engineer SM Shafik Ul Moula, and the murder of former National University vice-chancellor Aftab Ahmed. bdnews24
