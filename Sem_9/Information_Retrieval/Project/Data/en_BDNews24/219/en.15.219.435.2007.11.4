<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 04 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Sunday set Nov 15 for the verdict in a corruption case against former BNP state minister Iqbal Hasan Mahmud Tuku. Judge Ashraf Hossain of the Special Judge's Court-5 fixed the date after closing statements from the state and defence lawyers. The High Court earlier halted the trials of Tuku's wife Romana Mahmud, son Abed Hasan Mahmud and daughter Sara Hasin Mahmud. The Anticorruption Commission filed a case with Mohammadpur Police Station on March 21 charging the four with concealing information on their wealth statement on assets worth Tk 4.96 crore. Police arrested Tuku's wife and daughter on July 3 and the same day his son turned himself in to authorities. All three were bailed out although the former state minister has been in prison since his arrest on Feb 3. "The allegations made against the defendant have been proved from the facts presented. I appeal to the court for the severest form of punishment permitted by law," said state counsel Md Rafikul Haque Benu in his closing statement. Counsels for the defence Barrister Azmalul Hossain and Dr Azizur Rahman Chowdhury said the state had failed to prove the charges and asked for the defendant to be set free. Tuku has claimed his innocence throughout the trial. bdnews24
