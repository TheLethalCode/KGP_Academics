<TEXT>
 LONDON, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Conservative candidate was summoned to meet the party chairman on Sunday after saying Enoch Powell's notorious "rivers of blood" speech on immigration had been proved right. Nigel Hastilow, due to contest a marginal West Midlands seat at the next election, will meet Caroline Spelman in London, a Conservative spokeswoman said. Labour ministers said his comments exposed the Tory party's "racist underbelly" and called on party leader David Cameron to sack him. Writing in a newspaper, Hastilow said Powell was right to warn that uncontrolled immigration would change Britain forever. "He was right," he wrote in the Wolverhampton Express & Star. "It has changed dramatically." Powell was sacked from the shadow cabinet in 1968 after saying in a speech that Britain was "mad, literally mad" to allow large-scale immigration. Hastilow later said his views were in line with party policy and reflected the views of many people in the West Midlands. "Uncontrolled immigration will do this country great damage," he told the Observer. "In the last 10 years we have had more or less uncontrolled immigration." Immigration has risen to the top of the political agenda in recent months. The government came under intense pressure last week after it said it had underestimated the number of foreign nationals who have come to work in Britain. The Conservatives say the current level of immigration is unsustainable. They want tougher controls to ease pressure on schools, housing and health services. Cameron has, however, sought to avoid inflammatory language when discussing the issue. In a speech last week, he called for a "grown-up discussion" on immigration. Shadow Home Secretary David Davis told ITV1's "The Sunday Edition" that the comments were not representative of the party. "He (Hastilow) has got to understand that this is an area where you have to deal with great sensitivity," he said. Labour's Work and Pensions Secretary Peter Hain said Hastilow should be dropped as a Tory candidate. "This Conservative candidate really exposes the racist underbelly of the Tory party," he told BBC News
