 Dhaka, November 4 (bdnews24.com) The Awami League Sunday sat in a meeting with the Election Commission at the commission secretariat to talk about electoral reforms. Acting party chief Zillur Rahman was leading an eight-member team to the crucial meeting that began at 10:45 am. Party presidium member Tofail Ahmed, prior to the meeting, said that the basis of their discussion would be a 31-point charter of demands placed in 2006 by Sheikh Hasina before the administration of Khaleda Zia. Hasina had announced the demand on behalf of the 14-party alliance but the then Khaleda administration did not consider the issue. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda and his deputies Sakhawat Hossain and Sahul Hossain were attending the meeting. bdnews24.co
