<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)  A probe committee chief has accused the former BNP state minister for youth and sports of depriving the National Sports Council (NSC) of Tk 50 crore in revenues in the allotment of shop in the Bangabandhu National Stadium (BNS). "We have stumbled into terrible accounts of corruption in every step as [M Fazlur Rahman Patal] misused his power to do this and he can't avoid the responsibility," Brigadier Nazib Hasan told bdnews24.com Saturday. "We will recommend punishment to several persons taking their names in the report," he said, adding that he hoped to submit the report by Nov 15. The Fakhruddin Ahmed-led emergency-government formed a seven-strong probe committee in March to enquire into corruption and other irregularities in the NSC, the country's apex sports body. He alleged plunder of public money through tampering with the tenders. "For instance, a shop worth Tk 3 crore had been allotted for only Tk 60 lakh, another outlet priced at Tk 35 lakh had been allotted for Tk 9 lakh. Such examples galore," Brigadier Hasan said. The former BKSP director general said they were now working on the NSC's tenders floated in the last five years. The committee also discovered that funds had been siphoned off from the construction work of the NSC, even outside the capital. The investigators after talking to the constructors and the suppliers found that NSC counted Tk 4 crore in losses from the construction of the multi-storied NSC Tower. "The stated materials were not used in constructing the NSC Tower, but hefty payment was made. Even the site book (where engineers write down their opinions) clearly reads that substandard materials were used in the NSC Tower," said Hasan, adding that a total of Tk 4 crore was wasted in the construction. The committee found the Bangabandhu National Stadium to be "very risky" after examining the tender for its renovation. "The stadium can collapse any time," said Hasan. He suspected financial scam in the BNS renovation as the budget was extended from Tk 3 crore to Tk 24 crore. The committee also found involvement of the then NSC director (planning and development) Nurul Haq Prodhan, who appeared before the investigators several times, in the corruption. "Not only him (Prodhan), other former NSC officials directly or indirectly were also involved in corruption," said Hasan. bdne
