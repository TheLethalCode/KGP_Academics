 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Sunday granted bail to businessman Salman F Rahman, former FBCCI chief Abdul Awal Mintoo but declined bail to former Jaamat MP Shahjahan Chowdhury. It halted the proceedings and asked the state to explain why the inclusion of the cases under the emergency powers rules were not illegal. The High Court bench of justices Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Zubayer Rahman Chowdhury gave the rulings on three separate writ petitions filed by the defendants. Barrister Rafiqul Haque defended the three, while deputy attorney general Syeda Afsar Jahan and advocate Abdul Aziz Khan argued for the state. The Anticorruption Commission filed a case on Oct 1 against Rahman on charges of amassing Tk 182 core by rescheduling a loan of Tk 192 crore from AB Bank by forging documents for six plots of land in Gazipur. The case was included under the emergency powers rules the same day. Salman subsequently challenged the decision in a writ petition. On Aug 12, a case was filed at Ramna Police Station charging Mintoo with extorting Tk 50,000. The former chief of the apex trade body also challenged the decision to include the case under the emergency powers rules. The corruption watchdog filed a case on July 1 at Chittagong Port Police Station charging Shahjahan with concealing assets worth Tk 30 lakh in a wealth statement required when importing a duty-free automobile. The former lawmaker later challenged the legality of taking the case under the cover of the emergency powers rules. bdnews24
