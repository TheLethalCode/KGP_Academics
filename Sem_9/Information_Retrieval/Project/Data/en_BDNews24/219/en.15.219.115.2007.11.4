 KHARTOUM, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two high-profile detained Sudanese opposition politicians said on Sunday they would begin a hunger strike until they are either released or charged with a crime. Mubarak al-Fadil, head of the opposition Umma Party for Reform and Renewal, and the Deputy Secretary-General of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), Ali Mahmoud Hassanein, are among 25 opposition figures who were arrested and accused of a coup attempt but have not been charged almost four months later.

The violations ... and ... the lack of prompt access to legal counsel, will undermine the defendants' right to a fair trial," she said in a report last month. "The Special Rapporteur has received allegations that some of the detainees were tortured or ill-treated by National Security officers to force them to admit involvement in the alleged coup," her report added. She urged the government to work with more transparency in the matter. Fadil's cousin, Sadig al-Mahdi, won the last democratic elections in 1986 and was prime minister until the current government took power in a bloodless coup three years lat
