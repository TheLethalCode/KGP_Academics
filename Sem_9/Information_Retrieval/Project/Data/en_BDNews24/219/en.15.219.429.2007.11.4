 ISLAMABAD, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan police placed leading opposition figure and former national cricket captain Imran Khan under house arrest early on Sunday, hours after President Pervez Musharraf imposed emergency rule citing militancy and a hostile judiciary. Activisit Asma Jahangir, chairman of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, was also placed under house arrest, as was dismissed chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry. "Imran Khan has been put under house arrest while (opposition lawyers) Munir A. Malik and Aitzaz Ahsan were arrested under a one-month detention order," Khan's close aide and senior lawyer Hamid Khan told Reuters.
