 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)  RAB arrested and detained Hotel Purbani International managing director Mahbubur Rahman Joynal, after a Dhaka magistrate refused to accept his surrender to court Sunday. Accused in four separate cases, he surrendered to a Dhaka court but chief metropolitan magistrate Enamul Haque refused to accept the surrender An assistant to the CMM said the day's working hours were over, despite Joynal's hours-long wait after surrendering to the court. Minutes later RAB arrested Joynal, commanding officer for RAB-3, Sultan Mohammad Nurani, told bdnews24.com. Joynal's girlfriend Jannatul Ferdous Niki had earlier been arrested by RAB, an officer confirmed to bdnews24.com. The Rapid Action Battalion had widened its hunt for the businessman and his girlfriend, both accused of having close ties to the Yaba trade. As part of the recent drive against the drug, a RAB-3 team raided Joynal's home in Dhanmondi Monday to arrest Niki, a well-known model. Niki was dragged away by security forces from the court premises in Old Dhaka when she also tried to surrender, witnesses said. Several lawyers present on the scene said Niki was seen on the court premises, but later "remained untraced". Her lawyer, Barrister Abdullah Al Mamun, told bdnews24.com: "We came to court to seek justice, but that was not possible. Jannatul Ferdous was illegally dragged away by the security officers." At least 30 lawyers were on the court premises when the drama unfolded, bdnews24.com's legal affairs correspondent reported from the scene. Major Imrul Kayes Chowdhury, an officer of RAB-3, confirmed the arrest of Niki, but refused to confirm where she had been arrested. He said a formal announcement would come soon. bdnews24.com/
