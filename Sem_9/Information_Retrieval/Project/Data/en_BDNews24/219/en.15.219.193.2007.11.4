 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)  ASM Hannan Shah, the BNP chairperson's adviser, asked the Election Commission Sunday to involve ousted secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain and detained party chief Khaleda Zia in any future talks on electoral reforms. The request came from an 11-member BNP delegation, headed by Hannan, that called on Chief Election Commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda at the commission's office. Hannan told reporters after the one-hour meeting that they had submitted a letter to the CEC requesting the EC to include the BNP chairperson and Delwar in future dialogues. "I hope that the commission will invite Khandaker Delwar Hossain in accordance with the EC's stated policy and our party's own charter," said the chairperson's adviser. Responding to a query on the outcome of more then one BNP faction conducting talks with the EC, Hannan said: "There is only one BNP." "It remains united under the leadership of Khaleda Zia, and no one else. The EC would not do anything to hamper the electoral process," said Hannan. Election commissioner Md Sohul Hossain said the commission would decide within a day or two which elements within the divided party would be invited for discussions. Also present at the meeting were Akhtaruzzaman, Moazzem Hossain Alal, Ashraf Uddin Nizam, Sohrab Uddin, Shirin Sultana, Abdul Momin Talukder, Abul Kalam Azad, Rizvi Ahmed and Mujibur Rahman. bdnews24.co
