 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnes24.com) - Stocks rebounded Sunday buoyed mainly by institutional buying, after a week of profit taking dampened the markets. "It appears that merchant banks have adjusted their margin loans to some extent. The market is witnessing investors buying again after a minor correction last week. It's quite normal," said Salahuddin Ahmed Khan, chief executive of the Dhaka Stock Exchange. The market grew over 1.5 percent early in the day amid a rush to buy. It calmed down midway but picked up toward the end of the day. The DGEN or general index was up 35.44 points or 1.24 percent to 2871.76. The DSI or all-share price index climbed 31.98 points or 1.32 percent to 2443.96. The DSE-20 blue chip index rallied 35.64 points or 1.62 percent to 2230.30. Gainers beat losers 123 to 76. Some 17 scrips remained unchanged. A total of 12,810,602 shares worth Tk 2.11 billion changed hands. Social Investment Bank ruled the turnover board on rumours that it would be removed from the central bank's list of problem banks. Social Investment Bank climbed 8.87 percent to Tk 502.75. The bank said it had applied to Bangladesh Bank to be taken off the problem bank list. But it had not yet received a consent letter from the central bank, Social Investment Bank officials said. Sharif Ataur Rahman, a broker at SAR Securities with 30 years' experience said," Investors are upbeat. Now new shares are needed to cool down demand." The second most active issue, BRAC Bank, recovered from losses last week and grew 1.04 percent to finish at Tk 1492.75. Trust Bank ended at 1117.5, up 3.32 percent the previous day. Islami Bank also regained pace. Energy stocks declined amid profit taking. Power Grid Company of Bangladesh led the downturn, losing 0.56 percent to end at Tk 616. DESCO shares also declined. Grameen1 Mutual Fund led the gains in mutual funds. Grameen1 MF added 3.82 percent to Tk 84.10. Insurance issues ended higher with Fareast Islami Life Insurance gaining as it emerged as the most active issue in the sector. Speculations that life insurance companies' paid up capital would be increased to Tk 150 million under new insurance laws drove up life shares in the sector. All the major indices on the Chittagong Stock Exchange rallied, led by banking, insurance and mutual funds shares. A total of 2,392,552 shares with a value of Tk 239.72 million were traded. Sixty-seven scrips advanced, 46 lost and nine held steady. bd
