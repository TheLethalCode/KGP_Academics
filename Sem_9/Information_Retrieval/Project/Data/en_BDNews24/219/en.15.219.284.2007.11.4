 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)  BNP's acting secretary general Hafizuddin Ahmed Sunday challenged Mir Shawkat Ali's statement that he had participated in the arrest of general Ziaur Rahman on Nov 3, 1975. "It was not me, it was captain Hafiz who had gone to arrest Zia. General Shawkat committed a blunder in mistaking me for captain Hafiz," said retired major Hafizuddin. On Saturday Mir Shawkat concurred with a statement by Hannan Shah alleging Hafizuddin's involvement in the arrest. "We heard major Hafiz went to arrest Zia at his residence on November 3. I was not in Dhaka that day. But I'm sure [Khaleda] Zia and Bangabandhu murder case convict major Mohiuddin will be able to testify as to who went to arrest Zia that day, as they had witnessed the event," Mir Shawkat said. But, Hafizuddin, a sector commander during independence war, challenged Mir Shawkat. "The general said Khaleda Zia was one of two witnesses who could corroborate his claim. Well, I'll leave politics immediately if Khaleda Zia says that I had gone to arrest her husband on that occasion." While briefing reporters at his Banani home, Hafizuddin said, "General Shawkat has made a mistake and many officers serving in the army at that time can vouch for me." He alleged that some news organisations were maligning the BNP and tarnishing its reputation by publishing confusing and unverified reports. He called on journalists to uphold the principle of responsible reporting. Hafizuddin said, "I was brigade major of the 46th Infantry Brigade when those incidents occurred under the orders of chief of general staff Khaled Musharraf. We all know that the army is based on carrying out superiors' orders." Saying that he served the BNP for 16 years, Hafizuddin said, "General Shawkat is my senior and I respect him. But he has said that I served the army for six years and that I'm a newcomer to the party." "I beg to differ. I served the army for seven years and joined the BNP in 1992 at the request of Khaleda Zia after winning a seat in parliament in 1991." Hafizuddin said many ex-lawmakers had telephoned him to say that they had not made statements in favour of Khandaker Delwar Hossain, amid newspaper reports that they had. Newspapers Sunday ran reports claiming that 122 former MPs had given statements supporting Delwar. He said Lutfur Rahman Khan Azad, Kalimuddin Milan and Nurul Islam Moni, who is in Singapore for medical treatment, told him over the telephone that they were surprised to see their names included in the reports. "I don't think BNP needs to be divided, despite efforts by some to sow rifts in the party. Khaleda Zia is our leader and she will remain so, wherever she may be," said Hafizuddin. In reply to a query, Hafizuddin said, "Misunderstandings had come up over [Abdul] Mannan Bhuiyan's ouster, which was done by misrepresenting certain facts to the chairperson with a view to angering her." "But that has been taken care of now." He said he planned to visit Khaleda in jail soon. ZA Khan, Shah Abul Hossain, and Ali Newaz Mahmud Khayyam were present at the press briefing. Retired major Manzur Kader said that he was not aware of the statement allegedly made by 122 BNP leaders and published on the party letterhead without anyone's signature. He said he had not signed the statement and that he respected the ideals and philosophies of Ziaur Rahman to consolidate the solidarity of the country's people and armed forces. bdnews24
