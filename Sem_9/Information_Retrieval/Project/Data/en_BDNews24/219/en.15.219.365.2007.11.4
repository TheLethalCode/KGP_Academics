<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 04 (bdnews24.com) BNP chief Khaleda Zia will write to the Election Commission to confirm if the new committee of the party has any mandate to run the party, a lawyer said. There is confusion among party activists about the new committee formed recently at a meeting at the home of former finance minister M Saifur Rahman. The party is sharply divided over the issue. Shimul Biswas, also a BNP leader, broke the news quoting the detained party chief after he met her in the special jail on the Sangsad Bhaban premises. "Khaleda Zia has asked followers and leaders of the party to stay united," Shimul told bdnews24.com. He said Khaleda also asked to form a legal team to free the detained leaders and workers of the party. Shimul said the party had given some other policy instructions to the party leaders. "I will discuss them with party leaders first. We will then inform the media," he said. DIG (prisons) Shamsul Haider Siddiqui said Shimul stayed inside the special jail for more than one hour. bdnews24.com/l
