<TITLE> Asia calmer after Fed, but vigilance necessary </TITLE>

 HONG KONG/SINGAPORE, August 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The panic over credit conditions that hammered Asian stock markets last week subsided on Monday, but analysts warned against complacency and the Australian central bank again boosted money market liquidity. Stock markets rallied strongly after the US Federal Reserve moved on Friday to cut the discount rate that governs direct loans to US banks by a hefty half a point to 5.75 percent and signalled a willingness to take more dramatic action. "The Fed's move has given everyone a psychological boost. It's a short-term thing, though. It doesn't deal with the longer-term issues, the underlying problem from the decelerating housing sector in the United States," said Song Seng Wun, economist and head of research at CIMB in Singapore "There's a little bit of a break in the clouds now. Of course, a cut in the Fed funds rate will be debated now. If that was to follow, it would mean growth in the United States is significantly slower than expected." Australia's central bank again injected a sizable amount of liquidity into the banking system on Monday, seeking to temper upward pressure on some short-term money market rates. Money markets elsewhere seemed to be functioning normally. Japanese Finance Minister Koji Omi, asked by reporters whether the Group of Seven industrialised countries would take joint action against market volatility, said only: "I am watching developments." Germany, which holds the G7 presidency, said on Friday there were no plans for a special G7 summit and that policymakers were already keeping in close touch with each other. Japan's central bank now seems unlikely to raise interest rates at this week's policy board meeting. Before the market turmoil, a quarter-point increase to 0.75 percent -- the highest in a decade -- had been widely expected. RALLY ON RATE CUT HOPES The Fed's surprise action fuelled a relief rally in Asian stocks. MSCI's measure of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan had risen 4.7 percent by 0440 GMT. That followed a 9.6 percent slump last week -- the biggest weekly decline since January 1998. Japan's Nikkei average ended 3.0 percent higher, recovering from its biggest one-day fall in nearly six years on Friday. Still, stock market watchers were wary about further credit problems arising and the risk that financial market turmoil would cut economic growth. "I'm still a wee bit cautious. Our position in our funds is generally on the defensive side. We built up fairly high cash positions. We put some of that to work on Friday," said Robert Horrocks, Hong Kong-based head of research at Mirae Asset, which manages about $45 billion. "We've taken the opportunity today to make sure that all portfolios are positioned in what we'd regard as stocks with a high degree of earnings certainty." Strength in equities cut into demand for safe-haven government bonds, pushing Japan's 10-year bond futures down from a 17-month high struck last week. Spreads in the yields of emerging market sovereign bonds over US Treasuries, an important measure of risk appetite, narrowed a further 3 basis points, having tightened more than 15 basis points on Friday. Some participants questioned whether the more positive mood in emerging fixed-income markets could be sustained. "There could be managers out there looking at this as an opportunity to reduce risk until all redemptions are met. I would give it at least 1-2 months' time. The situation is still unfolding," said Clifford Lau, a fund manager with Pramerica. In a sign the US credit market problems are far from over, Sentinel Management Group Inc filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Friday. The cash management firm serving the US futures industry decided on Tuesday to freeze client accounts. The yen stabilised around 114.80 per dollar after dropping from a 14-month high of 111.60 hit on Friday. The yen had rallied on the unwinding of carry trades, in which the low-interest-rate Japanese currency was used by speculators as a cheap source of funds to buy higher-yielding and often riskier assets in other currencies. The New Zealand and Australian dollars each fell as much as 1 percent against both the dollar and the yen on Monday as those carry trades were unwound. Asian currencies rallying against the dollar included the South Korean won, Singapore dollar and high-yielding Indonesian rupiah. "Overall, the Fed's prompt action lowers the risk of a recession for the US economy and bolsters confidence in our baseline forecast of a favourable macro-environment in emerging Asia," JPMorgan strategists Claudio Piron and Yan Ping Ho said in note. "Having said that, the route to normalisation is unlikely to be immediate and markets are likely to remain very unsettled in the next several weeks," they said.
