 SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two Americans who served as Marines in Fallujah, Iraq, in 2004 face charges of killing three men detained in the search of a home in which weapons were found, US officials said on Monday. The charges represent the latest in a series of incidents in which members of the US armed forces are alleged to have committed violent crimes in Iraq, actions that have intensified international criticism over the US invasion. Military prosecutors charged Sgt. Jermaine Nelson "for the unlawful murder of an unknown foreign national in Fallujah Nov. 9, 2004," a statement from Camp Pendleton, north of San Diego, said. Nelson's squad leader, Jose Luis Nazario, also faces criminal charges, but since he has left the military he was charged with voluntary manslaughter by the US Attorney in Riverside, California. Nazario and other Marines detained four men while searching a house from which they had earlier taken fire, according to the complaint filed with the US District Court in Central California. They also found AK-47 rifles and ammunition. "Nazario said that he was asked 'Are they dead yet?" to which Nazario responded 'Negative,'" the complaint said, referring to a radio conversation. "Nazario said he was told to 'Make it happen.'" The complaint said Nazario killed one of the unarmed men who was lying on his back on the floor. "Who else wants to kill these guys, because I don't want to do it all myself," Nazario then said, according to the charges. The execution-style killings were so brutal that bits of brains and blood splattered on Nazario's boots and rifle. The charges referred to two other Marines acting with Nazario, but the names are redacted in the version made public. Nazario was released on $50,000 bail and faces a Sept. 12 arraignment after pleading not guilty, a spokesman for the US Attorney's office said. He had been working most recently with the Riverside Police Department as a probation officer but was released from the force on August 7, said Steven Frasher, a police spokesman. Both Nelson and Nazario served with Kilo Company, 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment. Some members of the same unit are facing charges over the killing of 24 civilians in an incident in Haditha, Iraq. Camp Pendleton spokesman Lt. Col Chris Hughes said Nelson was not detained and continued to work on the base. He said the nearly 3-year-old case came to light when a Marine from the unit was taking a lie detector test while applying for a civilian job
