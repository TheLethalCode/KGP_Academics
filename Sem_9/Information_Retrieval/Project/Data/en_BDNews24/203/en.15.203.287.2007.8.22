<TITLE> Iran, IAEA agree ways to defuse atom suspicions </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TEHRAN, Wed Aug 22, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran and the UN International Atomic Energy Agency said Tuesday they had agreed on a plan on how to help defuse Western suspicions about Tehran's atom work, a move hailed as a "milestone" by a senior IAEA official. But a senior US official said on Wednesday, a nuclear cooperation pact Iran struck with the International Atomic Energy Agency has "real limitations" and Tehran should stop trying to manipulate UN inspectors. "Of course, we welcome any progress in resolving troubling questions about Iran's nuclear activities," Gregory Schulte, US ambassador to the UN nuclear watchdog, said of Tuesday's deal announced in Tehran and hailed by the chief IAEA negotiator as "a milestone". "But we understand there are real limitations with the plan, including Iran's continued refusal to implement the IAEA's Additional Protocol," Schulte told reporters by conference call in Vienna, headquarters of the IAEA. He was referring to a measure allowing inspectors to check at sites not declared to be nuclear but seen as important to resolving longstanding questions about the scope and nature of Iranian nuclear activity. Schulte also said Iran's condition that it would not implement the transparency plan unless the UN Security Council shelved steps to increase sanctions on Tehran was unacceptable. After two days of talks in Tehran, the two sides said they had drawn up a timeline for answering outstanding questions about Iran's nuclear program, which the West believes is aimed at building atomic bombs. Iran insists its plans are peaceful. But the United States, leading efforts to isolate Iran, has said Tehran must both cooperate with the UN inspectors and halt sensitive nuclear work, a step Iranian officials have rejected, if it wants to avoid a third round of UN sanctions. "We have in front of us an agreed work plan. We agreed on modalities on how to implement it. We have a timeline for the implementation," IAEA deputy director Olli Heinonen said after the negotiations, which he described as "good and constructive." "I think this was an important milestone," he told a press conference. "But this process will take its time." Iran agreed in June to draw up an action plan within 60 days to grant more access to its nuclear sites for inspectors of the Vienna-based IAEA and clear up longstanding agency questions about the nature and scope of the program. The UN body has long complained that Iran has stonewalled its inquiries into the murky history and scope of Tehran's nuclear activities and curbed inspector movements, preventing the agency from giving Tehran a clean bill of health. Heinonen said work would start swiftly on implementing Tuesday's agreement, with activities later this month as well as in September and October. Details of the deal would be included in a report for the IAEA board by early September. "We have a basic framework of agreement between Iran and the agency," Iranian deputy nuclear negotiator Javad Vaeedi told the joint news conference, saying talks yielded "great results," according to a translation of his words by Iran's PRESS TV. "We are serious about implementing this," Vaeedi said. In Washington, the State Department said the agreement was "insufficient" and does not bring Iran in line with demands by the UN Security Council to halt uranium enrichment, or face more penalties. "Given Iran's failure to fulfill its UN Security Council requirement to immediately and verifiably suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, we believe the UN Security Council must move forward as soon as possible with additional sanctions," State Department spokesman Gonzalo Gallegos said in a statement. "... 'Plans' for cooperation are no substitution for actual cooperation and Iran's actions in the coming weeks will speak louder than its words," Gallegos said. The latest discussions had been due to tackle some of the thorniest issues such as the origin of traces of highly enriched -- or bomb-grade -- uranium found on some equipment and the status of research into advanced centrifuges used in enrichment. Iran and the IAEA previously met in July and earlier this month. After the July talks, Tehran allowed UN inspectors to revisit the Arak heavy-water reactor, which is under construction. Tehran had cut off access in April in protest at UN sanctions. The United Nations has imposed two sets of sanctions since December because of Iran's failure to halt uranium enrichment, a process which can make fuel for power plants or bomb material. Iran, the world's fourth largest oil producer, says it wants to generate nuclear electricity and save oil and gas for export. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad made clear again his country would not bow to pressure and stop enrichment. "The enemies are not able anymore to cause obstacles for Iran's developments in the nuclear issue," he said in Ardebil, northwest Iran, the Fars News Agency report
