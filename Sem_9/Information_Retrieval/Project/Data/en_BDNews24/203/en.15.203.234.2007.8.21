 Dhaka, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com) -- The government Tuesday decided to withdraw troops from the Dhaka University campus, a day after a spell of violence left about 200 people, mostly students, injured. The pullout was to begin at 8pm Tuesday, according to a government statement. The move for army pullout from the violence-torn campus was meant to ease the nervy situation that continued through a second day, but it apparently did not calm the angry students. The latest incident was reported in F Rahman Hall where students clashed with the police, prompting rounds of teargas shells, bdnews24.com correspondent Jannatul Ferdous Tanvi reports. The emergency government decided to open a judicial inquiry into the violent incidents at Dhaka University, the government said in the statement. The army has already started an investigation into the incident that took place at the Dhaka University playground Monday, according to the statement. "The probe will end soon and action will be taken against the persons responsible as per the findings of the investigation," the government said in the statement. The statement said the government had regretted the incident and appealed for calm and discipline on the campus. The chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim had earlier confirmed the news to bdnews24.com after a rushed meeting at the Chief Adviser's Office. The chief adviser and other caretaker advisers, the army chief, home secretary, pro-vice chancellor of Dhaka University, chiefs of law-enforcement agencies and military and other officials were present. DEMAND FOR APOLOGY Meanwhile, angry Dhaka University students demanded a public apology from army chief Moeen U Ahmed for what they said was an unwarranted incident on the campus. General Moeen has been set a deadline to apologise to the students by Wednesday noon. From a press conference at Madhu's Canteen on the campus, the students said if the army chief did not apologise they would press ahead with their movement. The students rolled out a five-point charter of demands, including the army pullout from the campus. bdnews24.co
