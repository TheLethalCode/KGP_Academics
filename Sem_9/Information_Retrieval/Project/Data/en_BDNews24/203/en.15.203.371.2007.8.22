 Dhaka, Aug 22 (bdnews24.com) -- A top civil servant at the Chief Adviser's Office has said that curfew will start at 8pm Wednesday in six divisional headquarters. A formal announcement is expected soon. In an early statement Wednesday, the government had asked people to maintain peace and discipline. The emergency government issued the statement amid violence that spread to parts of the country. The government also warned people of stern action if they do not listen to the call for calm and violate law and order. The statement released by the Press Information Department said some "rowdy non-students" continued to stage protests and damaged private and public property, despite the withdrawal of the army camp from Dhaka University. "The government would not hesitate to resort to the strictest possible measures in case unlawful acts were perpetrated," the PID handout added. bdnew
