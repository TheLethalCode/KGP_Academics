 KHARTOUM Tue Aug 21, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sudanese forces surrounded and attacked Darfur's most volatile camp on Tuesday to flush out rebels they say are behind recent attacks on police, an army source and camp residents said. The move on Kalma camp, home to 90,000 people, follows two attacks in the past week on police posts in South Darfur, one near Kalma and the other inside al-Salam camp. One policeman was killed and eight injured. "At 6 a.m. the government of Sudan moved 2,000 soldiers to surround the camp -- army, police and border intelligence," said Abu Sharrad, a spokesman for Kalma Camp. Sharrad, who called Reuters from inside the camp, said government forces had opened fire but it was unclear if anyone was killed or injured. "We still cannot tell. They are still surrounding the camp," he added. An army source said those who attacked the police posts were believed to be in Kalma camp, where rebels have previously taken refuge. "This is an administrative, organizational operation to restore internal security," he said, adding the army was not involved, only police forces. Kalma camp is one of Darfur's most volatile. Government offices were torched and officials expelled from the camp in 2005. Last year frustrated camp residents rioted, looting an African Union police base in the camps and hacking to death their Sudanese translator. The 7,000-strong African Union force in Darfur has failed to stem the violence despite a 2006 peace deal. While large-scale fighting has largely ended, rebels and militias have fractured creating lawlessness and uncontrolled banditry. International experts estimate some 200,000 people have died and 2.5 million driven from their homes since mostly non-Arab rebels took up arms in early 2003. Khartoum agreed to a 26,000-strong joint UN-AU force which will absorb the AU mission and try to stop violence which has hampered the world's largest aid operation in Darfur. Some 500,000 people are out of reach of relief worke
