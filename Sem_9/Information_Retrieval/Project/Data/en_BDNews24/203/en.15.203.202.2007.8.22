<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 22 (bdnews24.com)The Dhaka University Teachers' Association (DUTA) Wednesday reaffirmed its demand that the state of emergency be lifted. A DUTA silent procession starting from Aparajeyo Bangla marched to the Shaheed Minar at 11:30 am defying the ban on processions and rallies under emergency rule. Thousands of students joined the DUTA procession, demonstrating their solidarity with the DUTA demands. "Some of our demands placed Tuesday are still unmet, the most crucial of which is our demand that the Caretaker Government repeal the emergency rule immediately," said Professor Anwar Hossain, the DUTA general secretary at the Minar. Anwar, however, thanked the government for meeting some of their demands tabled earlier and expressed the hope that the CG would accede to their remaining demands. Meanwhile, police-student clashes continued at the DU campus for the third straight day Wednesday. Police, driving riot cars, chased demonstrators near the Nilkhet cross-section, trying to disperse them with tear gas shelling. Students vandalised an auto-rickshaw outside the Vice Chancellor's residence at around 11:45 am The students, on the other hand, taking up positions in front of Jahurul Haque Hall and Sir F Rahman Hall threw brickbats at the police in retaliation. bdnews24.
