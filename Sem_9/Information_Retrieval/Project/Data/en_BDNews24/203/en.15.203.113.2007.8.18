 Abdur Rahim Harmachhi bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com)  Lutfor Rahman, like some 50 lakh Bangladeshi expatriates, has been working in Riyadh of Saudi Arab for more than three years But he is not aware of the fact that the money the country receives is not being put into productive sectors. "I will be working in Saudi Arabia for four more years and do something when I return home," Rahman told bdnews24.com, hours before his travel back to Riyadh from his home village in Bhuapur in Tangail. On what he would do back home, he said, "My father had purchased some land with the money I've sent. I'll buy some more land, repair the house and get my younger sisters married." Rahman is not alone. Many expatriate Bangladeshis do not know that the remittances are being spent in unproductive sectors. Economists, business leaders and bankers say the government only emphasises increasing remittance, but it does not make proper use of what the expatriates earn through hard work. A major portion of the remittance is spent on luxuries. Shops were built in village markets, but no investment was made in industries or in the capital market. According to the latest data of the central bank, expatriates had remitted nearly $6.0 billion back home in fiscal 2006-07, the highest in Bangladesh's history, which is a rise from $4.8 billion a year ago. The remittance over the last few years has kept the country's economic cycle running. The remittance fuelled inflation too. According to the latest data of Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, point-to-point inflation was 9.20 percent in June, the highest in 15 years. Qazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmed, president of Bangladesh Economic Association, told bdnews24.com: "We conducted a research under Bangladesh Unnayan Parishad and found that 80 percent of the remittance had been spent on luxury items." "Part of the money was spent on running cases and building mosques. The prices of essentials were higher in areas where people sent money from abroad," he said. "In statistics, it was found that prices are higher in Sylhet, Maulvibazar, Faridpur and Tangail as many people from these regions stay abroad." "It is very difficult to use the remittance in productive sectors if the government does not take any initiative. Expatriates must be provided special incentive to invest in Bangladesh," he said. "The government can also initiate an expatriate bank. Investments in small and medium enterprises would also be possible through this bank." A former deputy governor of Bangladesh Bank, Khondker Ibrahim Khaled, said: "Remittance is contributing greatly to inflation. Fish which sells at Tk 400 in other areas of the country, sells for Tk 1,000 in Sylhet as the expatriates from Sylhet number the most." "The government should look into the matter so that remittance does not increase inflation," he said. "A trust, at government initiative, can be set up as in neighbouring India so that remittance is not spent on purchasing land and luxury items. The trust would contribute to industrialisation," he said. FBCCI president Mir Nasir Hossain said: "Remittance is not having any contribution to industrialisation. The government too is not taking any initiative in this regard. We have to make arrangement so that the remittances find their way into the capital market." "Large amounts in remittance are coming to the country. This is a good sign for the economy. We have to be careful so that the remittance is used in the productive sectors and inflation not increased," he said. bdnews24.
