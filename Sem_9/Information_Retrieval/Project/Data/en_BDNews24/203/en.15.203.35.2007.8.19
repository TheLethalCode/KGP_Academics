 KABUL, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghans should stand on their own feet and save their country from further foreign meddling and intervention, President Hamid Karzai said on Sunday as the nation marked the 88th anniversary of its independence from Britain. Afghanistan has relied largely on Western troops for its security and on foreign donor funds to prop up its economy since US-led forces overthrew the Taliban in 2001. "Gaining independence is one word ... but maintaining independence is a separate word," Karzai told a large audience at an anniversary celebration in at Kabul's sports stadium. "In order that our dear Afghanistan does not again come under attack, intervention and machinations -- acquiring education is a must for us ... so that we can rid ourselves of the need for foreign assistance." Frustration is growing with Karzai's government, not only among ordinary Afghans but the country's foreign backers too, over rampant corruption, insecurity and the booming heroin trade. The ceremony was held under tight security, largely provided by Afghan forces but also by some US personnel. Huge billboards of Afghan figures who had fought against British Empire, Soviet invaders and the Taliban, were displayed at the stadium, where the Taliban used to stage public executions. Karzai said Afghans, with the help of the international community, had "freed" Afghanistan from the Taliban and their foreign allies such as al Qaeda. But Afghanistan's enemies were still trying to block the country's progress, he added. "Dear youths of the country, once again we see that our soil is under the attack by Afghanistan's enemies," said Karzai. "We again see that efforts are made to block our development ... to hamper reconstruction, progress and development of Afghanistan." He said the past two days of deadly suicide attacks in the southern province of Kandahar were examples of the efforts to "stop Afghanistan's progress". The Taliban's elusive leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar, on the eve of anniversary, said Afghanistan was still occupied, referring to the presence of nearly 50,000 Western troops under the commander of NATO and the US military. He urged Afghans to unite and join the Taliban Islamic movement in its campaign to drive out the troops from Afghanistan
