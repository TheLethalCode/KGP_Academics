 Dhaka, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Monday sentenced film actor and ward commissioner Monwar Hossain Dipjal and his wife to seven years rigorous imprisonment for possessing illegal ammunition. Judge Nuruzzaman of Dhaka Metropolitan Special Tribunal-7 handed down the verdict although only Dipjal's wife, Romana Monwar, was present for sentencing. Dipjal has remained at large since joint forces raided his Gabtoli home on March 8 and seized 585 rounds of ammunition and five magazines. His wife Romana was at home during the raid and was ordered to open a locked cabinet where the illegal ammunition was discovered. The judge said Dipjal's sentence would begin the day he is imprisoned, although Romana's sentence will be reduced by the time she has already spent behind bars. The husband and wife were charged under the section 19 of the Arms Act. On hearing the verdict Romana broke down in the dock while her children vented their frustration over the verdict. On July 26, another court sentenced Dipjal, in his absence, to 17 years rigorous imprisonment in a separate arms case. bdnew
