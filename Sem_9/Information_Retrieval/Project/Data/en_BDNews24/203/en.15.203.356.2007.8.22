 YANGON, Aug 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Myanmar's military rulers arrested 13 leading dissidents on Wednesday in a series of midnight raids in Yangon designed to quash protests against rising fuel prices and falling living standards. The junta also deployed armed police at street corners in the former capital, as well as truckloads of men from its feared Union Solidarity and Development Association (USDA) network. Dozens of USDA members carrying brooms and spades were seen in the city centre, pretending to be street cleaners. In a rare announcement in all state-run newspapers, the junta said the dissidents had been arrested for "agitation to cause civil unrest" and "undermining peace and security of the state", charges that could put them in jail for up to 20 years. The reports, which also referred to the "ill-intention of grabbing power", confirmed names given to Reuters by relatives and friends. Min Ko Naing, Ko Ko Gyi, Min Zeya, Ko Jimmy, Ko Pyone Cho, Arnt Bwe Kyaw and Ko Mya Aye -- all leaders of a 1988 student-led uprising put down ruthlessly by the military with heavy loss of life -- were among those detained, they said. Min Ko Naing, winner of US, Canadian and European human rights awards, was released in November 2004 after 15 years in jail, but was detained last September for four more months. "Military intelligence and government intelligence seized their houses and searched their houses," another dissident, Htay Kywe, said in a recording emailed to Reuters by Myanmar exile groups in neighbouring Thailand, referring to the detained dissidents. The government agents had seized papers and mobile phones, he added. Htay Kywe had managed to evade capture during a similar raid on his family home in Yangon and had gone into hiding, one of the exile groups said. The arrests came ahead of a planned protest on Wednesday against huge fuel price rises, the latest in a rare series of small demonstrations against deteriorating living conditions and galloping inflation in the former Burma. The government raised fuel prices by up to 500 percent without warning last week. TORTURE FEARS The Washington-based US Campaign for Burma said it feared those arrested would be ill-treated. "Min Ko Naing and the other leaders arrested have all been severely tortured during previous incarcerations and we are gravely concerned for their immediate well-being," policy director Aung Din said in a statement. Min Ko Naing's 88 Generation Students Group had condemned publicly the fuel price increases and organised a 400-strong peaceful protest march through Yangon city centre on Sunday. However, Min Ko Naing -- a nom de guerre which means "conqueror of kings" in Burmese -- was not linked to Wednesday's planned protest under the auspices of Ko Htin Kyaw, a social activist who has been arrested four times this year. Ko Htin Kyaw had said Wednesday's protest would go ahead unless the military regime that has been in charge for the past 45 years rescinded the price rises. The world's biggest rice exporter when it won independence from Britain in 1948, Myanmar is now one of Asia's poorest countries. Its most prominent detainee, 62-year-old Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, has been confined for much of the past 17 years. Human rights groups and the United Nations say as many as 1,100 others are behind bars for their political beliefs. bd
