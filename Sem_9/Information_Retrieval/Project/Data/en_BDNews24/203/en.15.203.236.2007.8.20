<TEXT>
 BEIJING, August 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The death toll from the collapse of a Chinese bridge made with rocks and concrete rather than stronger steel has risen to 64, state media said on Monday. More than 1,500 people were searching for bodies in the rubble of the bridge across the Tuo river, in the southern province of Hunan, which was near completion when it collapsed last Monday, the China Daily said. Some 152 people were believed to have been working on the structure when it fell apart, according to one rescuer quoted in newspapers "like beancurd". Twenty-two workers were injured. The search for victims became easier after explosives were used to blast open the three collapsed concrete pillars but a source with rescue headquarters said final figures of the dead and missing could only be known after the rescue work was over. The government on Saturday suspended work on all unreinforced arch bridges across the country for safety checks.
