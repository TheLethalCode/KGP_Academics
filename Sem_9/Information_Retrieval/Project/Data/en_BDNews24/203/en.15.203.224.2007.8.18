 Dhaka, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh Football team left Bangkok for Malaysia to take part in the Merdeka Cup following intervention of private airlines GMG officials in the transit visa crisis the team faced. The footballers left the country for Malaysia on Saturday at 12 noon on a GMG flight via Bangkok and were confined to the Bangkok airport for four hours for not having transit permission, and later they left Bangkok after GMG officials intervened. "We did not take the transit visas as we knew that we would have to take the Air Asia flight at the same airport, but Air Asia of Malaysia uses Thailand's domestic airport and the players were confined to the Bangkok international airport," said Bangladesh Football Federation acting general secretary Manzoor Hossain Malu. "The GMG officials, however, came forward to mange the transit issue and the team left for Kuala Lumpur," said Malu. Hosts Malaysia are providing the team tickets from Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur while the Bangladesh Football Federation, from Dhaka to Bangkok.
