 Dhaka, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com) - Central bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed Saturday ruled out any negative impact on the banking business from lowering interest rates on the import of some essentials. Ahmed was speaking to reporters following a memorial lecture on late Barrister Syed Ishtiaq Ahmed, titled "The roadmap to financial system standards for middle income Bangladesh". The governor said that an interest rate cut would not affect the banking industry because part of its business was related to food import. He said that banks opened 2 to 3 percent LCs for food import. Despite that Ahmed assured the bankers saying that the move was a temporary one and had been taken for the greater welfare of the people. The Bangladesh Bank last week fixed the interest rate for import of 11 essential items at a maximum of 12 percent, earlier above 15 percent. The move was taken to rein in the rising prices of food items in the local market. "I hope the bankers and the businesspeople will cooperate with the government to tackle the current situation," the BB Governor told reporters. Replying to a query on the contracting monetary policy, Ahmed said the issue of following the policy was not so important at the moment. He also said that the government planned to increase supply and production to contain the soaring inflation. Prof Sirazul Islam chaired the lecture, organised by Barrister Syed Ishtiaq Ahmed Foundation at Asiatic Society, Bangladesh. National Professor Sufia Ahmed also spoke. bd
