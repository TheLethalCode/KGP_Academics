 Dhaka, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com)The High Court Sunday granted bail to former law minister barrister Moudud Ahmed in a narcotics case. The court also ruled that the government must explain within eight weeks why the inclusion of the case under the emergency powers rules should not be declared illegal. A High Court bench of Justice Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Justice Zubayer Rahman Chowdhury handed down the verdict on a writ petition by Moudud. Moudud's lawyer Md Azizul Haque said, "My client won't be released for now, as there is a detention order against him under the emergency rules, although there is no other case against him." Joint forces arrested the former minister on April 13 at his Gulshan home. Fourteen bottles of foreign wine and 32 cans of beer were seized after joint forces raided his house. Police filed a case the same day under the Narcotics Control Act with Gulshan Police Station. However, the government later brought the case under the emergency powers rules on April 26. Moudud filed a writ petition with the High Court earlier this month, challenging the legality of bringing the case under the emergency powers rules. bdnews
