 Dhaka, Aug 19 (bdbnews24.com) - Smarting from a 2-0 drubbing against Syria, the Bangladesh national football team face hosts India in their second match of the 13th ONGC Nehru Cup at Ambedkar stadium in Delhi Monday. To be in the race in the five-nation tournament, Bangladesh will have to overcome hosts India, who recorded their biggest victory in four decades trouncing Cambodia 6-0 in the tournament opener. Before leaving the country, Bangladesh's Indian coach Syed Nayeemuddin and captain Nazrul Islam said they want to win against hosts India and Cambodia in the tournament. Nayeemuddin Saturday took a defensive strategy of 4-5-1 formation against tournament's top- ranked Syria and came out successful till the first half, but they had paid off the mistakes made by the Bangladesh defenders in the second half. Bangladesh might get the extra inspiration from Nayeemuddin under whose guidance India once beat Bangladesh 2-0 to clinch the SAF Football Championship title back in 2005 in Pakistan. Besides, their involvement with football in last six months may inspire them to produce a good show against the hosts. India, however, are ahead of Bangladesh according to the statistics. Of 21 meetings, Bangladesh beat India only three times and were beaten 10 times and other eight meetings ended in draws. According to the Indian media, India have improved a lot in last one year under the guidance of English coach Bob Houghton and the team are gradually improving their standard of the play. India also showed brilliant performances in the matches they had played against the Portugal clubs as part of their preparation for the Nehru Cup.
