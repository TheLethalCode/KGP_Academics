 TOKYO, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Australian author of a controversial book on Japan's Crown Princess Masako said on Tuesday he had received death threats, ahead of the book's Japanese-language release this week. The Japanese government has said that the original version of Ben Hills' "Princess Masako - Prisoner of the Chrysanthemum Throne" was an insult to the royal family and had sought an apology from him.

Japan's Foreign Ministry sought an apology and "appropriate steps" from Hills regarding the book in February, but did not comment at the time on aspects such as his assertion that Princess Aiko may have been conceived through in vitro fertilisation. Kyodo news agency said the Japanese edition's publisher had also been threatened by an ultra-nationalist group to stop the publication. Hills said publishing the book in Japanese was a matter of freedom of speech. "I'm very happy that it's being published in Japanese because I think that it doesn't matter whether the Japanese people like it or don't like it," he said. "What matters is that they should have the chance to read it and judge for themselve
