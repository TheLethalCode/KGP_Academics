 Dhaka, August 21 (bdnews24.com)Several political parties Tuesday commemorated the third anniversary of the grenade attack which wrecked havoc on an Awami League rally in August 2004. The assailants, who are yet to be identified, attacked an anti-terrorism rally in front of the Awami League's party headquarters on Bangabandhu Avenue. The then opposition leader Sheikh Hasina narrowly escaped the attack although 22 party activists died and a further 500 were wounded. Tuesday's commemoration was a low-key affair in view of the state of emergency, which has barred all political gatherings. The brief ceremony began with the placing of wreaths at the memorial plaque on Bangabandhu Avenue. The Awami League and its front organisations, the Workers' Party of Bangladesh and the Sammyabadi Dal joined the ceremony. Also present were many victims of the attack, some of whom still carry their scars from that day. Acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman reaffirmed his belief that the previous BNP-led coalition government had masterminding the attack. The BNP has repeatedly denied the allegation. Zillur said: "We demand the interim government open a new investigation into the carnage and bring those guilty to justice." "It is really sad that she [Sheikh Hasina] is not here with us today," Zillur added. Rashed Khan Menon, president of the Workers' Party of Bangladesh, said: "Sheikh Hasina, the main target of the August 21 attack, is now in jail." "This government must prove whether the rule of law will exist in this country or not. We demand a proper investigation into the Aug 21 attack," he said. bdnews24.
