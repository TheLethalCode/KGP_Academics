<TITLE> Britain's public finances set record July surplus </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's public finances swung dramatically into the black last month as robust tax receipts helped government coffers record their biggest ever surplus for a month of July. The strong economic picture could strengthen speculation that Prime Minister Gordon Brown will call a general election later this year or next. However, some economists say that with global financial markets in turmoil and economic growth set to slow in the coming months and years, the government's longer term targets look challenging. Official data on Monday showed the public sector posted a net cash repayment of 13.1 billion pounds last month. This beat forecasts for a reading of 11.0 billion pounds and was the biggest repayment for a month of July since records began more than 20 years ago. The government's preferred accruals-based measure -- which is less volatile than the cash measure -- showed a surplus of 6.5 billion pounds. This also beat forecasts and was a record for July. January, April, July and October are traditionally surplus months in the public finances calendar due to the timing of tax receipts. "The figures are better than the market expected and show government borrowing is progressing in the right direction," said David Page, economist at Investec. CHALLENGE AHEAD The government had pledged to keep a tight lid on spending and has a borrowing target of 34 billion pounds for the full financial year. Against a background of strong growth and low unemployment, most analysts think this looks achievable. However, recent financial market troubles have only added to the downside risks and the government has precious little room for manoeuvre in the event of a downturn. "At the moment at least, economic growth seems to be holding up tax receipts but looking forward, whether the target is met on public finances depends a lot on the global economic picture," said Mark Miller at HBOS. The Bank of England downgraded its growth forecasts earlier this month and now reckons growth will slow from 3.0 percent currently to 2.5 percent in two years -- below the rate pencilled in by the government in its March budget. Government projections imply public spending growth will need to slow to just two percent a year in real terms from 2008 to 2011, half the rate it has been growing for the past five years. "It remains to be seen how fiscal performance might change should the present credit crisis become extended," said George Buckley, economist at Deutsche Bank.
