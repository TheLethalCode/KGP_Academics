 NEW DELHI, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) --India's communists stepped up their opposition to a controversial nuclear deal with the United States on Monday, with one senior leader threatening to cut off vital support to the government if it pursued the pact. The four main left parties, who have 60 MPs in the Lok Sabha have urged Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's coalition not to pursue talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to clinch the deal. When asked if the left would withdraw support if the government ignored its warning and went ahead with the talks, A.B. Bardhan, head of the second largest communist party, said: "There is no doubt about it." Bardhan's Communist Party of India accounts for 10 of the 60 left MPs. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) is the largest with 43 MPs and it is yet to clearly spell out whether it intends to end its backing. The government would fall or be reduced to a minority if the left lawmakers withdraw support. Under the deal, India will get access to US nuclear fuel and equipment for the first time in three decades to meet soaring energy needs, even though New Delhi has tested nuclear weapons and not signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Supporters hail the deal as a landmark in improving India-U.S. relations. Critics in India say it impinges on India's nuclear programme and independent foreign policy. The communists had earlier warned the government of "serious consequences" if it went ahead with the deal, virtually putting it on notice nearly two years before its term ends in 2009. "The left parties can understand the setting up of a committee or any other mechanism which can go into the objections regarding the agreement," a joint statement from the communist parties said, referring to a government plan to set up a panel to address their concerns. "But this can follow only when the next step at the IAEA is not taken," they said after top leaders held talks. The fresh communist warning came a day after the Congress party-led coalition closed ranks behind Singh and expressed optimism that the left's concerns could be addressed. Singh again emphasised on Monday the importance of nuclear energy for India as it tries to boost its energy sources for its rapidly growing economy. "I urge all political parties to appreciate the vital interest of pursuing a sound energy security strategy. India is on the move and we must be able to address its growing energy demand."
