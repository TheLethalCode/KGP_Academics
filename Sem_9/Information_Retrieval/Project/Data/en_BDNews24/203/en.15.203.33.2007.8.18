 Dhaka, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com)  The government is contemplating formation of monitoring committees with government and non-government officials, including members of joint forces, to control the prices of essential commodities during the Ramadan. Members of the committees will visit marketplaces to monitor prices, according to a plan. The council of advisers at its meeting at the Chief Adviser's Office Saturday discussed ways to form the committees. After the meeting, the chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim said: "The government is worried about the price spiral. Some short-term steps have been taken and the government hopes they will help bring down prices." Munaim ruled out any possibility of famine in the country. The government had an adequate stock of grains. He said the food ministry had a stock of 4.5 lakh tonnes of rice and 3.5 lakh tonnes of wheat. The press secretary said the commerce ministry and the BDR had presented information about the market situation to the meeting. Commerce adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam told the meeting that the local market was experiencing an adverse impact from price hikes on the international market. The adviser presented a comparative picture of market prices in fiscal 2006-07 and 2007-08, which showed that the price increase on the local market was lower than on the international market. Munaim told reporters that the measures meant to lower and withdraw duties on different commodities were short-term steps to keep the market prices tolerable. He also said the food and disaster management ministry would start open market sales of rice through 15,000 dealers across the country from September through Eid-ul- Fitr. bdnews24.c
