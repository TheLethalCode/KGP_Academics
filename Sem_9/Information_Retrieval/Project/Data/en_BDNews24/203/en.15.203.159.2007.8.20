 CHICAGO, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sentinel Management Group Inc., the cash management firm serving the US futures industry that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection late on Friday, failed to keep adequate books and records, according to a National Futures Association document filed in federal court on Monday. The NFA went to Sentinel's offices on August 14, the document shows, and reviewed the firm's books and records. That review found "that Sentinel failed to maintain adequate books and records, including records to demonstrate the location" of some accounts and whether or not the account's assets were in any way encumbered, the NFA document says. As a result, the NFA issued an order prohibiting Sentinel from "liquidating, selling, transferring, encumbering or otherwise disposing of any securities." That order came one day after the firm, which managed about $1.6 billion of assets, had already frozen client accounts -- a move that helped roil global financial markets last week.
