<TITLE> Crackdown gives hope to Taslima Nasreen </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KOLKATA, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Taslima Nasreen said Sunday she hoped that a crackdown on corruption and crime in politics by an army-backed government back home would eventually pave the way for her return. The writer fled Bangladesh for the first time in 1994, when a court said she had "deliberately and maliciously" hurt Muslims' religious feelings with her Bangla-language novel "Lajja", or "Shame", which is about Hindu-Muslim riots. At the time, thousands of radical Muslims protested against her, demanding that she be killed for blasphemy, and some have continued to threaten her life. Taslima, who now lives in Kolkata after having taken refugee in Europe and the United States, said she hoped the interim government in Dhaka would launch a crackdown against "religious fundamentalist forces" as well. "The recent action is good for Bangladesh as corruption had spread to all corners of the country," Taslima told Reuters in an interview by telephone. "I hope they will take action against fundamentalist forces and curb their growing influence also. "I will live in Kolkata now, but continue to fight for my return to Bangladesh." "CANNOT PLEASE ALL" Taslima, 44, has not made any new attempts to return home and her Indian visa was extended for six months last week. Her comments came two days after Kolkata's Muslim clerics issued a "death warrant", threatening her life if she did not leave the country. Earlier this month, Taslima was attacked by radical Muslims in southern India during the launch of a translation of one of her novels but she was not hurt. The author describes herself as a "secular humanist", and criticises the use of religion as an oppressive force. She did not link her desire to return home to the recent threats to her. "I know I cannot please everyone and I will continue to criticise inequality through my writings," said Taslima, who has not left her highly guarded home for the last few days. "I have been writing poems and articles and have seen a few close friends only," she said. The author said she was not afraid of the threats to her life and hoped that last week's "death warrant" would be withdrawn soon. "The clerics should realise that I am not an expert on religion and I only write for women and their rights," said the author, who was awarded the Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought in 1994 by the European Parliament. "I am sure most people who want my head never read my books." bd
