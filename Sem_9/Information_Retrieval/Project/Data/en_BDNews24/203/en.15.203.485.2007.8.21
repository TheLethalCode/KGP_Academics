 Dhaka, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh national cricket team Tuesday handed a 60-run and five-wicket defeat to the Australia-bound National Cricket Academy in two Twenty20 practice matches ahead of the ICC Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa in September. To be accustomed to the Twenty20 cricket, the practice scheduled for the national team has been decked up featuring more practice matches, but there was a little sign of the attitude of the Twenty20 match at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium Tuesday. The national team raced to 104 for five in 17.2 overs in reply to the Academy team's 103 for six in 20 overs in one of two matches. "They should have chased the target of 104 in 12 to 14 overs," said Academy team batting coach Minhajul Abedin Nannu after the match. But, Bangladesh team captain Mohammad Ashraful defended his side saying, "Yes, there was lack of excitement, but it was not bad to reach the target in 17 overs. It is more important to be habituated to winning the match. Besides, we had a lot of overs to win the match." The captain, however, said that they had returned to action after 25 days and all of them might not be hundred percent fit following the commando training held in Sylhet last week and that it seemed there was no excitement in the matches. Brief score of the first match: Bangladesh: 144 for nine in 20 overs (Aftab Ahmed 43, Saqib Al Hasan 33, Alok Kapali 21, Mushfiqur Rahim 12, Farhad Reza 8, Mashrafee Bin Mortaza 7, Tamim Iqbal 6, Mohammad Ashraful 4, Mahmudullah 2, Junaed Siddique 0, Abdur Razzak 0 not out, Dollar Mahmud 3/30 and Nayeem Islam 2/17). Academy: 84 all out in 19 overs (Nasiruddin Faruque 21, Nayeem Islam 12, Saqib 3/12, Razzak 2/5). Brief score of the second match: Academy: 103 for six in 20 overs (Mehrab Hossain 39, Nayeem Islam 33, Dhiman Ghosh 16, Mashrafee 2/13 and Razzak 2/25). Bangladesh: 104 for five in 17.2 overs (Ashraful 45, Saqib 15, Nazimuddin 8, Junaed 7, Tamim 6, Nadif Chowdhury 8 not out, Kapali 6 not out and Dollar Mahmud 2/16).
