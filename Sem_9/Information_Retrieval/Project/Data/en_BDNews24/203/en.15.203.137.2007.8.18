<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com) -- The interim cabinet Saturday took a decision to raise the president's personal fund allocation to Tk 1 crore from its current figure of Tk 50 lakh, a spokesman said. The increase in the fund will see an amendment to the President's Remuneration and Privileges Act 1975, the chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim told reporters after a cabinet meeting. The allocation to the president's personal fund had not been increased since 1987, but the allocation to the personal funds of the prime minister, ministers and state ministers had been raised twice in the same period, Munaim pointed out. However, he could not say what their present allocations are. Munaim said the cabinet also approved proposals to amend the Court Reform Implementation Act 2004. Also approved in the meeting was a proposal for an amendment to the municipality ordinance guiding the suspension of ward commissioners elected to general and reserved seats. The municipality ordinance was previously amended in April this year, although the provision at that time only covered the suspension of municipality chairmen. bdnews24.com/
