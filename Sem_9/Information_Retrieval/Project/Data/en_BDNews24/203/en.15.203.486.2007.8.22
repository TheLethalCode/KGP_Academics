 Dhaka, Aug 22 (bdnews24.com) - Violent clashes between students and police broke out in the city's Mohakhali areas Wednesday morning. The trouble started when students of Titumir Government College took out a procession in a show of solidarity with their Dhaka University comrades. bdnews24.com correspondent Abdur Rahim Harmasi reported from the spot the demonstrating students, later joined by locals, fought pitched battle with the law-enforcers in front of the Square Corporate Building on the main road from Mohakhali to Gulshan 1 roundabout and inside the college premises. Traffic on the entire stretch of the road came to a screeching halt and all offices on the main road were shut down following the clashes. Private TV channel ATN Bangla cameraman Pintu, Focus Bangla photojournalist Ratan and Titumir College history teacher Nazma Begum were injured during the clashes. The clashes began at around 9:30am when the agitating students started smashing windscreens of vehicles passing on the road. They started throwing stones and sticks at cars and the on-duty policemen. After a few rounds of clashes, students threw stones at the multi-storeyed Square Headquarters at about 11:30am, breaking several windows. The mob tried to break into the building, but failed as the main entrance to the building was kept locked. Police entered Titumir College campus at 12:30pm and beat up students. They also entered the main college building and beat some more students. After about 15 minutes of clashes the students regrouped on the campus and chased police out. They again came out of the campus and pelted stones at police on the main road. bdnews24.com correspondent Fahmida Wadud Chaity who witnessed the attacks said police put up barricade on the main road near the BRAC University. Students of East West and BRAC universities, located on the main road, were trapped inside their campus buildings and had been advised not to go out. Teachers of Titumir college were trying to calm their students down when last reports came in. Apart from large police forces, troops from the nearest camp were also present to protect public property. bdnew
