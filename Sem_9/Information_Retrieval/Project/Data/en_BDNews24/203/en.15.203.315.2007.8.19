<TITLE> Joorabchian calls for new inquiry into Tevez saga </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kia Joorabchian, the agent of Carlos Tevez, says he wants a new inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the Argentine's move to Manchester United from West Ham United earlier this month. Tevez joined Manchester United in a complicated deal from West Ham after playing a big part in saving the London club from relegation last season. West Ham were fined 5.5 million pounds ($10.87 million) in April for breaking Premier League rules which outlaw third-party ownership when they signed Tevez last August. They were not punished with a points penalty, however, and were allowed to keep playing Tevez after satisfying the Premier League that the third-party agreement with Joorabchian had been torn up -- something Joorabchian says he did not agree to. "I don't like the way (Premier League chief executive) Richard Scudamore has, in a roundabout way, made suggestions and dragged me, my players, West Ham and the Premier League through the mud during this period of time," Joorabchian told Sky Sports. "That's why I want a proper independent inquiry and if the Premier League clubs agree, I'm willing to finance it, whatever it costs. Let's have total transparency Mr Scudamore, we have nothing to hide. "Why was a full, transparent and thorough investigation not done when your member clubs have a right to know what's happened? Why are they clouding this issue? "Why were the full facts not heard? Why were people not questioned? They never once asked us about any paperwork, never held discussions with us, never wrote us a letter. How did they decide on a 5.5million fine with only 50 percent of the facts." Joorabchian insisted that he still owned Tevez's economic rights last month as the player's move to Manchester United stalled. He launched High Court legal proceedings against West Ham, although the two parties eventually struck a deal in which West Ham received a two million pounds fee and Tevez moved to United on a two-year loan deal. This week Sheffield United said they will sue West Ham for the cost of relegation from the Premier League last season -- estimated at more than 30 million pounds. The Yorkshire club were refused leave to appeal against the Premier League's decision not to dock points from West Ham last season over the Tevez saga
