<TITLE> Turkish parliament votes on Gul presidency, again </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ANKARA, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul was expected to finish ahead in the first round of a presidential election in Turkey on Monday, but was unlikely to secure the two-thirds majority needed in parliament for an outright win. Turkey's military and secular elite blocked his first bid to become head of state in April because of his Islamist past, triggering a parliamentary election in July which was intended to defuse the crisis over the presidency. Gul's centre-right AK Party has been strengthened by its convincing election win but it is still far short of the two-thirds majority in parliament needed for him to be elected president in the first- or second-round vote. He is expected to defeat his two rivals only in a third round of voting on Aug. 28, when he would need just a simple majority to win. The presidency has traditionally been held by the secular elite, and a former Islamist has never been elected president. Victory for Gul, 56, would complete the AK Party's capture of all key posts in Turkey's political hierarchy. Parliament's speaker will first check there is a quorum of at least 367 parliamentarians, and deputies will then cast their ballots. The first vote in April was derailed by a court ruling that two-thirds of parliament had to be present to make the process valid -- impossible amid an opposition boycott. This time emough parties have pledged to participate. The army undermined the April vote by threatening to intervene in the election process, but has signalled that this will not happen again. As recently as 1997 the army ousted a government in which Gul served because it was seen as Islamist. Turkey's financial markets had been troubled by the dispute that derailed Gul's first election bid, but are now more focused on volatility in global markets because Gul's eventual victory is widely regarded as a foregone conclusion. Turkey's lira came off earlier highs to trade at 1.3475 against the dollar, still firmer on the day. STATE AND RELIGION The presidential campaign has again brought to the surface the great divide among Turks, who are predominantly Muslim, over the role of religion amid fast economic and social change. Gul says he backs secularism but opposition from the secularist elite remains fierce as they accuse the AK Party of seeking to break down the division between state and religion. "If I am elected president, I will be careful with maintaining the balances within the country's administrations," Gul told reporters before the vote. Gul's wife wears the Muslim headscarf, seen by secularists as a provocative symbol of religion. It has become an unwritten rule that headscarves are not worn in the presidential palace. The main opposition CHP has said it will boycott Gul's presidential receptions and will again be absent for the vote. Having him as commander-in-chief will irritate a military establishment that sees itself as the ultimate guardian of the secular state and has removed four governments in 50 years. Gul is a respected diplomat who has overseen the launch of European Union accession talks as foreign minister and was briefly prime minister when the AK Party came to power in 2002. A Gul presidency will make the next government's job easier as it will no longer have to get laws and appointments past President Ahmet Necdet Sezer, who frequently vetoed their bills.
