<TITLE> Iraqi PM to urge Syria to curb insurgents </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 DAMASCUS, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki held talks in Damascus on Monday aimed at persuading Syria to drop what Baghdad sees as its support for insurgents in Iraq. Maliki is the first Iraqi prime minister to visit Damascus since the U.S.-led invasion toppled President Saddam Hussein in 2003 and ushered in instability that helped drive more than one million Iraqi refugees to neighbouring Syria. "There is no doubt of security figuring highly in these talks. But we will be also discussing economic underpinnings for our ties," said government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh. Maliki, who spent years in exile in Syria as a member of the Iraqi opposition to Saddam, met Syrian Prime Minister Naji al-Otari and was due to meet President Bashar al-Assad on Tuesday. An Iraqi official, who declined to be named, said Maliki would urge Assad to take measures to stop an alleged flow of fighters and weapons across the border. "Lax bordertrol is unacceptable. Insurgents are even using some of the same routes the Iraqi opposition used to smuggle weapons during Saddam's days," the official said. Damascus this month hosted an international conference on security in Iraq at which Iraqi officials urged Syria and other neighbouring countries to help boost Iraqi security or risk militancy at home. Syria agreed during the meeting to participate in an intelligence network to help the U.S.-backed Iraqi government counter the rebels and stop cross-border movement of fighters and arms. Iraq says Syria has been slow to take action in accordance with past security agreements. Syria says it has been boosting border control and insurgents have killed members of its own border force. The United States accuses Syria and its ally Iran of helping destabilise Iraq. Damascus and Tehran deny this and say a stable Iraq is in their national interest. Maliki won pledges of support from Iran during a visit to Tehran earlier this month.
