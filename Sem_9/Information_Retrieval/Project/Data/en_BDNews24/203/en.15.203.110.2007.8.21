 MADRID, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas has pulled out of the Spain squad for this week's friendly against European champions Greece after sustaining an injury during training on Monday. The Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) said Casillas bruised his right knee after colliding with Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas in a practice match at the team's training base in Las Rozas. Coach Luis Aragones has drafted Sevilla goalkeeper Andres Palop into the squad, although Liverpool's Pepe Reina is likely to start Wednesday's match. The national team doctor said Casillas's Real Madrid team mate Sergio Ramos would travel with the squad to Greece despite suffering injuries to his ankle and toe in Sunday's 5-3 defeat to Sevilla in the second leg of the Spanish Super Cup
