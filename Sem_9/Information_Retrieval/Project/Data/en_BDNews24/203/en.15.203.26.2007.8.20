 Dhaka, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com)  Hundreds of Dhaka University students Monday night burst into protest against army action that left at least five students injured, witnesses said. The students demanded withdrawal of the army camp from the campus and declared a strike for Tuesday at the university. They also said if their demand was not met, they would go on indefinite strike. In the wake of the army beatings, about 300 students gathered in front of the central library on the campus and announced the plan for the strike. A student of the international relations department spoke on behalf of the students. Some angry students vandalised a police car on patrol in front of the house of the vice chancellor. bdnews24.com dispatched three reporters and two photographers, who said the situation turned chaotic. They said the police tried to maintain order. The troops swung into action after students demanded public apology from an army man for verbally abusing a student when they were watching a football match in the DU playground. A bdnews24.com correspondent was among the witnesses to the incident. Police stepped in later and beat students when they took out a procession to press their demand for army pullout.
