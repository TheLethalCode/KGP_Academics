<TITLE> Orascom Telecom tumbles, weighs on Egypt's bourse </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CAIRO, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Foreign institutions dumped shares in Orascom Telecom on Monday, pushing the regional mobile phone operator to an eight-week low and sending main Egyptian stocks down despite a recovery in global markets. Shares in Orascom Telecom, the biggest listed Egyptian firm and the second heavily traded stock in the session by turnover, fell 4.7 percent to last trade at 68 Egyptian pounds ($11.97). Investors boosted international stocks and moved back into other riskier assets on Monday as immediate fears of a global credit crunch waned following the U.S. Federal Reserve's confidence-building move last week. Egyptian stocks led by OT, however, went in the other direction. "There is a lag in orders from last week," said Angus Blair, head of research at Beltone Financial in Cairo. "Some institutions still want to raise cash in some emerging markets. This is some people are taking profits rather than a major sell-off." he added. OT could also have been hit by negative retail sentiment after its withdrawal from an auction for a long-term mobile licence in Iraq, said Mohamed Ashmawy, trader at CIBC brokerage. The company said on Sunday it may sell its Iraq subsidiary after it deemed the cost of a long-term licence too high. Overall the well watched CASE 30 index lost 2.2 percent to 7,644.35 points while the benchmark Hermes index fell 1.9 percent to 67,942.88 points. The broader CIBC index was 1.4 percent down to 353.61 points. Other big caps were also in the red on Monday. Orascom Construction Industries shed 2.3 percent to 361.25 pounds and investment bank EFG Hermes lost 1.4 percent to last trade at 40.85 pounds. Commercial International Bank stock also was down 1.2 percent to 65.90 pounds. Bucking the market were shares in El Sewedy Cables, topping best CASE 30 performers and rising 1.6 percent to last trade at 75.80 pounds.
