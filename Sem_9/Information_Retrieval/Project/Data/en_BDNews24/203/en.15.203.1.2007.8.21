 NEW DELHI, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Angry Indian lawmakers disrupted parliament on Tuesday, saying the country's ambassador to Washington had likened them to a "headless chicken" for opposing a nuclear deal with the United States. Ambassador Ronen Sen said the comment was aimed at journalists not at politicians and apologised if he had hurt anybody's feelings. That did not placate MPs who forced both upper and lower houses of parliament to be adjourned. Some shouted slogans against Sen and asked the government to recall him.

Critics say the deal had compromised India's nuclear sovereignty and would bring India under Washington's strategic embrace, eroding the country's foreign policy. Communist allies who shore up the coalition have virtually put the government on notice, with some left-wing MPs threatening to withdraw support if New Delhi pursued the deal. On Tuesday, senior leaders of the two sides held fresh talks to resolve the crisis but reported little progress. Sitaram Yechury, a top leader of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the largest of the four left parties in parliament, said the government had yet to give in to their demand to stop seeking key global approvals for the deal.
