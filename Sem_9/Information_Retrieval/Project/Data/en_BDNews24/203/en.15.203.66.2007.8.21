<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com)  It all began Monday afternoon: a bout of violence that turned the Dhaka University campus into a battlefield. Mehedi Mohammad, a master's student of the public administration department, was watching a football match, holding up an umbrella against the blazing sun. A man from behind shouted and asked Mehedi to fold the umbrella, as it was blocking view. The man used abusive words as the players of the public administration and the mass communication and journalism squared off in the football match, Mehedi said. "I was watching the game, standing down the gallery. A man from behind asked me to fold my umbrella. He was abusive." "I looked back and asked who used the abusive words. One man held me by the scruff and said 'You should know I am from the army. How dare you! You mess with the army?'" The incident triggered the worst student protests after the emergency government came to power in mid-January. At some point, witnesses said, Mehedi also grabbed the army man by the collar. Some other army men stepped in and two of them started beating Mehedi. The troops tried to take the student to their camp but his classmates and friends came forward to rescue him. Army officer lieutenant colonel Huda intervened and tried to defuse the tension. bdnews24.com correspondent Mahbub Alam Rony witnessed the incident. Mehedi was taken to the Dhaka University health centre with injuries. bdnews
