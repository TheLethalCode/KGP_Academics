 Dhaka, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com) August 21 that jolted the nation three years ago comes again Tuesdayunresolved. Confusions and suspicions still abound over the 2004 brutal grenade attack on the Awami League rally when the party was in the opposition. The BNPJamaat coalition government that came to power in 2001 ended its five-year term without revealing any major lead to the incident that makes one of the bloodiest days in the country's recent history. It is still unclear what prompted and who were behind the attack that had left 22 Awami League activists dead. It was a normal busy day in the capital. The streets around the Awami League headquarters on Bangabandhu Avenue were crammed with vehicles and people. But the grenade attack came on the anti-terrorism rally by the Awami League crowding out all normal activitiesas the then leader of the opposition was just concluding her speech. Hasina escaped the attack almost unhurt, except some damage to her hearing organ. Apart from the dead, about 500 people, mostly Awami League leaders and activists, were wounded in the attack. Some journalists were among them. The government had appointed justice Joynul Abedin to probe the grenade attack but it had failed to trace the source of the grenades, if Sheikh Hasina was the main target or if there was any connection of a "third force" outside the country. The probe had only said "a foreign hand" could be in it. The Awami League had rejected the report and pointed at the then government for the attack. Hasina had said that such a wide-scale attack could not happen without support from government agencies. The BNP-led government had rejected the allegations. Meanwhile, an unofficial probe committee of the Supreme Court Lawyers' Association, led by Dr Kamal Hossain, also submitted a report, saying that the target of the attack was Hasina. The nerve-jangling attack also brought the FBI and Interpol to Dhaka to assist in the investigations. The Awami League Monday renewed its demand for a fair trial of the Aug 21 attackers, as the commemoration of the day Tuesday would pass without any major event since a state of emergency hangs over the country. A simple tribute, to be precise, wreaths will be placed at the scene of the violence. Acting AL president Zillur Rahman Monday said the law enforcement agencies did not capture the attackers although the attacks had been conducted in their presence. "The evidence of the attack was intentionally destroyed," he alleged. "The then alliance government did not accept the case filed by the Awami League as it (the alliance government) was involved in the attack," he told reporters at his Gulshan home. Zillur did not name any political party but apparently referred to the Jamaat and said: "Instead of arresting groups against which there were specific allegations of patronising militants, extortion and corruption, an adviser was speaking in their favour. "This is sad and unwarranted." bdnews
