<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com) -- The Criminal Investigation Department has been investigating whether militant groups had any connection with the August 21 grenade attack on an Awami League rally, a top official said Monday. The home ministry has directed the law-enforcement agencies, including different detective agencies, to remain on the alert for the activities of different militant outfits. "A substantial progress has been made in the investigation into the grenade attack," home secretary Abdul Karim told reporters after a meeting at the home ministry that reviewed the progress of the probe into the Aug 21, 2004 grenade attack that had targeted former prime minister Sheikh Hasina. Besides, a meeting of the monitoring cell for different sensational cases was held at the home ministry Monday. Karim presided over both meetings. Inspector general of police Noor Mohammad, Rapid Action Battalion director general Hasan Mahmud Khandaker and CID's additional director general Fani Bhushan Majumder were present. Replying to a question on whether the real culprits would get away due to the delay in the investigation, the home secretary said that Joj Miah, arrested in connection with the case, had given a confessional statement. "The truth will surely win," he asserted. He denied an allegation that Joj Miah's mother was promised money to make her son give a confessional statement and later not paid the promised sum. "The ministry and the monitoring cell were only looking into the progress of the case. I hope investigators will succeed in unearthing the real cause behind the incident and identify the criminals," he said. On the review of the progress of sensational cases, Karim said that 267 cases had been filed in connection with the Aug 17, 2005 countrywide bomb attacks. Of the cases in which chargesheets were submitted, the trial of 44 had been completed. As many as 153 cases are on trial, he said. In the cases that completed trials, 35 people were sentenced to death and 70 to life imprisonment. Karim said the government restarted an initiative to create mass awareness against militant activities. The programme remained stalled for some time for different reasons. At present, the ministries of home, information, religious affairs, education, social welfare and local government were working to chalk out a publicity strategy. A decision will be taken soon at a meeting. bdnew
