 BAGHDAD, August 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A mortar attack killed 10 people on Sunday in a Shia district of eastern Baghdad where witnesses reported clashes between US forces and Shia militiamen. The US military last week launched a new nationwide offensive targeting Sunni Islamist al Qaeda and Shia militias. Washington and the US military say they fear al Qaeda and militias will step up attacks to try to influence debate ahead of a report on the Iraq war due to be presented to Congress in mid-September. At least four mortar rounds fell in al-Obeidi, which is close to Sadr City, a sprawling Shia slum and stronghold of powerful anti-American cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and his Mehdi Army militia. More than 40 other people were hurt. Al-Obeidi residents reported clashes between US forces and the Mehdi Army in the area after at least one US vehicle had been attacked by a roadside bomb during a patrol a day earlier. Police and residents said those clashes appeared to be separate to the mortar attack in a different area of al-Obeidi. The US military could not immediately comment on the reports of the clashes. Major-General Rick Lynch, commander of US forces south of Baghdad, said he believed up to 50 members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' Quds force were in his area of command, training militia fighters to use mortars and rockets. "We are concerned primarily about the training of Shia extremists. We think there are about 50 members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards," Lynch told a news conference. An Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman in Tehran called Lynch's accusations "baseless" and said they were not new. Lynch said there had been an increase in mortar and rocket attacks on US forces in his area of command and that rocket attacks were becoming "more accurate and more effective", a fact he attributed to more sophisticated Iranian weaponry. Washington has accused Shia Muslim Iran of fomenting violence in Iraq through its support for Shia militias. Iran denies the charges and blames the 2003 US-led invasion for the sectarian violence between majority Shias and minority Sunni Arabs that has killed tens of thousands. The latest US offensive is part of a security crackdown Washington says is meant to buy time for Iraq's fractured Shia-led government to reach a series of political benchmarks. US President George W. Bush said on Saturday while political progress was being made at a local level, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's government still had many important measures to resolve in order to meet those goals. Maliki, under pressure from over his government's negligible progress, was preparing for a second round of crisis talks on Sunday with political leaders from Iraq's Shia Muslim, Sunni Arab and Kurdish communities. An opening round of talks on Saturday were described by Deputy Prime Minister Barham Salih as "cordial but candid", but they did not reach agreement on any of the key issues. Washington wants signs of political progress towards reconciliation before US ambassador Ryan Crocker and General David Petraeus, commander of US forces in Iraq issue their report.
