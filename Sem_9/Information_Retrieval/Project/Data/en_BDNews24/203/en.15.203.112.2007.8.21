"They have all the required qualities to become the top side in the world. My main focus would be on improving their fitness and making them a more consistent side," he told a news conference. Lawson has been appointed on a two-year contract by Pakistan's cricket board and succeeded former England player Bob Woolmer, who died during the World Cup in March. He is Pakistan's third foreign coach since 1999 after South African Richard Pybus and Woolmer. Lawson said Pakistan had always been an unpredictable side, a trait that worked both ways. He said unpredictability could be a big advantage if it was used positively and did not become a habit. Lawson has taken up his new post a day after four top players, former captain Inzamam-ul-Haq, senior batsman Mohammad Yousuf, all-rounder Abdul Razzaq and batsman Imran Farhat joined an unofficial Indian Twenty20 league.
