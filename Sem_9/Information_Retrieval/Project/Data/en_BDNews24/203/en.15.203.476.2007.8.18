<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh national football team started their 13th ONGC Nehru Cup campaign being beaten 2-0 by top favourite Syria in their tournament opener at the Ambedkar stadium in Delhi, Saturday. After a tentative first half, Bangladesh went one goal down three minutes into the second half as Syrian skipper Maher Al Sayed found the back of the Bangladesh net. Then, striker Zyad Chaabo doubled the margin for Syria, the highest ranked team in the tournament. Bangladesh, coached by Indian Syed Nayeemuddin, played a containing game in the first half with a defensive formation 4-5-1 and the tactics of packed midfield worked as they hustled Syria into errors, according to All India Football Federation website. On the counter attack, Bangladesh came close to scoring in the 22nd minute when right winger Zahid Hossain, the most impressive Bangladesh performer, cut in, his long ranger nearly dipping in. After the first half, Syrian skipper Sayed from the left edge of the box, bulged the net with a rising left footer. In the 79th minute, after a quick exchange of passes, striker Chaabo placed past onrushing Bangladesh goalkeeper Biplab Bhattacharjee to make the final score 2-0. Despite making three changes Bangladesh rarely came into attack and struggled to contain Syria's cohesive moves. Bangladesh will play their second match against India on August 20. Teams: Biplab Bhattacharjee, Ariful Islam, Rajani Kanta Barman, Kazi Nazrul Islam (cap), Wali Faisal, Zahid Hossain, Abul Hussain (Mehdi Hasan) Arman Aziz, Firoj Mahmud Titu (Zahid Parvez Choudhury), Jahid Hasan Ameli and Robin (Alfaz Ahmed).
