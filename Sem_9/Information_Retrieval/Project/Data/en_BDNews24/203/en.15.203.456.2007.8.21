<TITLE> EU must act on Kosovo without UN: think-tank </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PRISTINA, Serbia, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union must recognise Kosovo's independence from Serbia by early 2008 even without a United Nations resolution or face "chaos on its doorstep," an influential think-tank said on Tuesday. The Brussels-based International Crisis Group warned that failure by the 27-member bloc to support a possible declaration of independence by Albanian leaders could lead Kosovo to "explode" and destabilise the region. The report said the EU should proceed on the assumption that fresh talks starting later this month will fail to close the chasm between Serbia and Kosovo's 90-percent ethnic Albanian majority. "The risks to Europe of inaction are substantial," the ICG said, adding Kosovo Albanian leaders will be under irresistible internal pressure to declare independence before 2008. "If they act and are not supported, Kosovo would fracture: Serbia reclaiming the land pocket north of the Ibar River, Serbs elsewhere in Kosovo fleeing, and eight years of internationally guided institution-building lost." If Russia holds firm in its opposition to a UN resolution offering Kosovo independence, the EU must take over supervision of the territory and "as many member states as possible" should recognise Kosovo if it declares independence following the end of talks in December. "To avoid chaos on its doorstep, the EU and its member states must now accept the primary responsibility for bringing Kosovo to supervised independence," the ICG said. It said the crisis would destabilise neighbouring regions, notably Macedonia and the Presevo Valley in southern Serbia, where large ethnic Albanian minorities fought for greater rights in 2000 and 2001, and where tensions remain beneath the surface. The report reflects the widely held assumption that the latest diplomatic push for compromise - led by a troika of envoys from the United States, Russia and the European Union - is destined to fail. The envoys are due to hold separate meetings with Serbs and Albanians in Vienna on Aug 30. A Russian threat to use its U.N. veto has blocked the adoption of a Western-backed plan to grant Kosovo independence under European Union supervision - the product of 13 months of sterile Serb-Albanian talks led by UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari. The territory has been run by the United Nations since 1999, when NATO bombed for 11 weeks to drive out Serb forces and halt the ethnic cleansing and killing of Albanians in a two-year war with Albanian separatist guerrillas. The EU has so far balked at the idea of deploying a law and order mission into Kosovo without a UN resolution, let alone recognise the territory as Europe's newest state. But Kosovo's 2 million Albanians say there is no way back. They are supported by Washington, which has 1,500 troops here as part of a 16,000-strong NATO-led peace force. The troika is due to report back to the United Nations by Dec 10, which Washington says is the deadline for talks to e
