 TEHRAN, August 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bandits blocked a road in southeastern Iran, opened fire at passing vehicles and took 30 people hostage on Sunday, Iran's ISNA news agency said. Some people were wounded in the shooting, it said. Police surrounded the area near the city of Chabahar in Sistan-Baluchestan, a volatile province known for frequent clashes between security forces and drug smugglers and other criminals. The IRNA news agency earlier reported that two people were taken hostage but said details were still not known. The gunmen blocked the way for a passenger bus, ISNA said, but it was not clear whether all the hostages were from the bus. They also shot at other vehicles and wounded some passengers, it said. Last week in southeastern Iran, officials said bandits took two Belgian tourists hostage. At least one of them has since been released. bd
