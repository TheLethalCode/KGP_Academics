 JOHANNESBURG, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Captain Shoaib Malik insists his team has not been affected by recent turmoil in Pakistani cricket as they prepare for next month's Twenty20 World Cup. "We have had three training camps in Pakistan and they have been very nice," Malik told reporters during a conference call from Lahore on Tuesday. "I am satisfied with the way the players are training and they have given me their support all the time, which is all I want. Pakistani cricket has had a difficult year after a disappointing World Cup and the untimely death of coach Bob Woolmer. The squad's preparations for the Twenty20 World Cup have been hampered by reports of a row between players and senior administrators, the defection of Mohammad Yousuf, Inzamam-ul-Haq, Abdur Razzaq and Imran Farhat to the Indian Cricket League and disciplinary problems for Shoaib Akhtar. Pakistan Cricket Board's (PCB) appeals committee decided on Monday to suspend the fine and penalty imposed last week on fast bowler Shoaib. The PCB had fined Shoaib $10,610 (5,344 pounds) and docked him 1.5 disciplinary points after he left a training camp in Karachi without informing the team's management. Malik added: "It is difficult at the moment... I am just focusing on the team. "Shoaib Akhtar is an asset and he has been supporting the youngsters in the camp. Of course Pakistan need him." Malik said he would be relying on Pakistan's tearaway fast bowlers to spearhead their challenge in the inaugural Twenty20 World Cup, which starts in Johannesburg on Sept. 11. "One good spell is all you need to win a game and our priority is our fast bowlers, that is our strength," he said. "Twenty20 is good for the game. It is exciting and it only takes three hours." Pakistan take on arch-rivals India in one of the showpiece games of the tournament in Durban on Sept. 14 and Malik said he expected a typically entertaining meeting. "It is always competitive and exciting when we play India and we are really looking forward to that game," he said. Malik was due to meet with new Pakistan coach Geoff Lawson for the first time on Tuesday afternoon
