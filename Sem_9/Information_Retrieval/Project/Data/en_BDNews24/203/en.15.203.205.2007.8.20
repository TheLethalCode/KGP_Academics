 GAZA, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Israeli missile killed six Hamas gunmen and wounded one other in the Gaza Strip on Monday, Palestinian hospital staff said. The Israeli army confirmed that it had fired at the vehicle carrying the militants. "There was a strike on a car carrying militants who today fired rockets into Israel and we identified hitting it," an army spokeswoman said. Hamas denied the dead gunmen had fired rockets. It has not claimed any rocket attacks on Israel since its violent takeover of the Gaza Strip from the rival Fatah group in June. Other militant groups have continued to launch many rockets across the border into nearby Israeli towns and agricultural communities causing some damage, a few injuries and deaths but great panic among civilians and a disruption of daily life. Hamas identified all six dead as members of their Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades military wing. It said the vehicle was hit as it arrived at a Hamas security post near the al-Bureij refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip. One of the dead was named as local Hamas commander Mohammed abu Arab. The Israeli army spokeswoman said the missile was not fired from an airborne platform. Local Palestinian residents had previously said the rocket was fired from an aircraft. A Hamas spokesman described Israel's action as an "ugly Zionist massacre" and said "all options were open" for a response. "The Zionist enemy (Israel) is playing with fire and they will have to shoulder the responsibility for the consequences of this crime," Izz el-Deen al-Qassam spokesman Abu Ubaida said. Asked whether Hamas would resume firing rockets into Israel, Abu Ubaida added: "If the Zionist enemy fears the possibility of a response with rockets then they should know that we have even more dangerous weapons." He did not elaborate.
