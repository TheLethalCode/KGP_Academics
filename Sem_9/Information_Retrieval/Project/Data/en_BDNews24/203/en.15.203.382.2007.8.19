 Dhaka, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com)  The government feels some recent initiatives it has taken have reduced the prices of local and imported essential commodities. "The ratio between the price of imported and domestic essentials has come down recently due to governmental measures," finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam told a seminar on inflation. Bangladesh Bank organised the seminar Sunday at the CIRDAP auditorium in the wake of spiraling market prices. According to the Bureau of Bangladesh Statistics, point-to-point inflation reached 9.2 percent in June, up from 8.05 percent a month ago. Food inflation rose to 9.8 percent in June from 8.98 percent in May. Asked why the government had failed to contain inflation the adviser said: "This is one point of view. What would have happened if we had not taken the measures we did?" "These have included the introduction of alternative markets run by the BDR, market monitoring and a cut in the interest rate?" He added: "Except for palm oil the ratio between domestic and imported prices has fallen for most items." The adviser attributed the continued hike in world prices for the ongoing rise in domestic inflation. Azizul said: "Basically, we should attempt to protect those [the poor] who are most affected by the rising inflation." The finance adviser also hinted he would go beyond budget provisions in order to protect the poor from surging market prices. The adviser reminded the seminar that per capita income had increased by 11 percent between FY 2005-06 and FY 2006-07. He said: "Bangladesh is not a small economy in the global market place, at least in terms of certain commodities." "The reality is that a rise in international market prices also affects this country," he added. Bank Asia chairman M Syduzzaman chaired the seminar, also attended by Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed. bdnew
