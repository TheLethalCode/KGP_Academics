 Dhaka, Aug 21 (bdnew24.com) - Bangladesh suffered a lone-goal defeat against Indonesia in their Merdeka Cup opener at the Shah Alam Stadium in Kuala Lumpur Tuesday. The Bangladesh second string football team conceded the lone goal in the 25th minute from a free kick, according to the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) official website. Saifur Rahman Moni squandered two sitters in the first half to disappoint Bangladesh. Bangladesh also dominated the Southeast nation in the second half, but they failed to restore the parity due to the Indonesian defensive strategy. Bangladesh will take on Singapore on Thursday in their second match of Group B, which also comprises Zimbabwe. Squad: Mazharul Islam Himel (goalkeeper), Amit Khan Shuvra, Hasan Al Mamun (captain), Mahmudul Hasan, Arafat Ali Rony, Parvez Babu, Enamul Haq Sharif (M Ronny), Saifur Rahman Moni, Zumratul Islam Mithu (Rony Islam), Motiur Rahman Munna and GM Mamun (Arup Kumar)
