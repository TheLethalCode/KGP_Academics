<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com) -- Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam warned bankers Sunday that action would be taken if they did not reduce their lending rates. "Bankers are charging high interest rates while offering a disproportionately low return on deposits," Azizul said at a seminar on inflation, organised by Bangladesh Bank at the CIRDAP auditorium. "I am seriously considering additional measures to reduce the gap between lending and deposit rates." Businesses leaders have described domestic rates as 'very high' compared to most other countries. According to central bank data, the gap between what banks lend at and what they provide to savers increased to 5.73 percent by March 2007. The figure was 5.38 percent in June 2006. During the same period lending and deposit rates increased by 64 basis points and 29 basis points respectively. For private commercial banks, nationalised commercial banks and foreign commercial banks, the spread rose by 47, 39 and 34 basis points respectively. However, the interest rate spread of specialised banks declined by 68 basis points during that time. Businesspeople sought intervention from the government to regain their confidence in effective management of the banking sector. "I will try to regain business confidence," said Azizul. The finance adviser asked business leaders to accept a temporary reduction in their profits for the sake of the nation. The seminar was also attended by Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed and leading economists and businesspeople. bd
