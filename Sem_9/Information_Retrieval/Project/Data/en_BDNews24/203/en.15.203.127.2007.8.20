<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com) The Bangladesh football team square off Indonesia after 22 years when the second string Bangladesh football team start their Merdeka Cup campaign at the Shah Alam Stadium, Kuala Lumpur, Tuesday. (Correction) In five meetings, Bangladesh beat the Southeast Asian nation, Indonesia, once and played a 1-1 draw in their last meeting in the Quaid-e-Azam Football tournament in Peshawar, Pakistan, in 1985 and it may be Bangladesh's lone inspiration for the Tuesday match. "Indonesia are better side than Bangladesh as we witnessed their practice Monday after having completed our practice at the Shah Alam Stadium," manager Amirul Islam Babu told bdnews24.com by phone from Kuala Lumpur. "In line with the strategy of the coach (Hasanuzzaman Bablu), the team will try to go for counter-attack after keeping the backline tight," said Babu adding that the team would play in 5-3-2 formation. The manager said that the boys are in a good shape and determined to produce a respectable result against Indonesia. The Bangladesh team, led by defender Hasan Al Mamun, are comprised mostly of young players along with four to five senior players and they got a little time to be prepared at home following the inclement weather. Bangladesh had a bitter experience against Indonesia in their first-ever meeting as they went 4-0 down in the same tournament in Kuala Lumpur in 1975, but in the second meeting, Bangladesh offered a tough fight against them and went 2-1 down in the Continental qualifier in Jakarta in 1984. In the FIFA world Cup qualifiers in 1985, Bangladesh suffered a 2-0 defeat in their away match and beat them 2-1 at Dhaka. According to the manager, the 11 probables of Bangladesh are Mazharul Islam Himel (goalkeeper), Hasan Al Mamun, Amit Khan Shuvro, Arafat Ronny, Parvez Babu, Mahmudul Hasan (defenders), Mohammad Sharif, Motinur Munna, Mamunul Islam Mamun (midfielder), Saifur Rahman Moni and Mohammad Ronny (strikers).
