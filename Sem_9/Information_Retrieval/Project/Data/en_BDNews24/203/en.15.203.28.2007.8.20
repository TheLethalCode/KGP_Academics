<TITLE> Baichung sinks Bangladesh in Nehru Cup </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com) - A five-minute strike from Baichung Bhutia sank Bangladesh's hopes to beat India as they suffered a 1-0 defeat to the hosts in their second match of the 13th ONGC Nehru Cup at Ambedkar Stadium in Delhi Monday. With the second defeat in a row, Bangladesh is almost certainly ousted from the five-team league tournament, though they have two remaining matches against Cambodia and Kyrgyztan on August 22 and 24. Capitalising on a right-side short from Steven Dias, Baichung shrugged off his marker Ariful Islam to score with a low angular left-footer, which struck the far post and trickled in. India enjoyed a comparatively superior ball procession throughout the game, but they failed to widen the margin because of Bangladesh keeper Biplob Bhattachariya, who stood tall to foil all Indian attacks. Compared to their previous match against Syria, Bangladesh's midfield was more organised in this match, and their subtle angular passing created many chances, according to the All Indian Football Federation's official website. In the 19th minute central midfielder Abul Hussain's stiff shot was saved by Indian goalkeeper Subrata Paul and a few minutes later Rajani Kanta Burman's long throw created panic in the Indian defence and Bangladesh were unlucky to not get a goal. Striker Jahid Hasan Ameli back-headed Rajani's throw to foil Indian goalkeeper Paul, but the ball hit the crosspiece to disappoint Bangladesh. Afterwards midfielder Zahid Hussain's long ranger also went narrowly over the crosspiece. After the breather, Baichung led by example in the second half and his quick turns and running off the ball troubled the Bangladesh defence. Clifford Miranda replaced Renedy and added thrust on the left flank. Clifford's long ranger was parried by goalkeeper Biplab, and following the corner kick by Dias Mahesh Gawli headed narrowly wide. Bangladesh coach Syed Nayeemuddin was happy with his boys' improved performance but felt that their attack needs to be sharper. Bangladesh: Bipalab Bhattachariya, Ariful Islam, Rajani kanta Barman, Nazrul Islam (capt.), Wali Faisal, Zahid Hossain, Abul Hossain, Arman Aziz, Firoj Mahmud Hossain Titu, Jahid Hasan Ameli and Mohammad Robin (Alfaz Ahmed) bdn
