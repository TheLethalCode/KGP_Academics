 Shaugat Ali Sagor bdnews24.com North America Correspondent Toronto, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com)  An influential US committee has marked Bangladesh for special watch for the human rights record of the country's security forces, according to an official document. The US Congressional Appropriations Committee has already nodded a bill, and it is expected to be passed into a law next month, according to the document available to bdnews24.com. Once the bill is signed into a law, Bangladesh will be the latest on the US watch list as countries such as Haiti, Guatemala, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sri Lanka, Ethiopia, Libya, Angola, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Indonesia, Bosnia, Herzegovina and Nigeria are already in the group. According to the document, the US provides military financing for many countries including Bangladesh, and if there is any proof that the security forces of a particular country are involved in any human or civil rights violation the US stops the fund. It means if the congressional committee finds that Bangladesh's security forces are involved in rights violations it would result in cancellation of the military fund, officially called Foreign Military Financing (FMF). According to the document, the Secretary of State monitors the activities of the security forces and submits a report to the "committees on appropriations". Section 671 of the proposed law says: "Not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations describing the procedures being applied, on a country-by-country basis, to monitor whether funds appropriated by this Act under the heading "Foreign Military Financing Programme" for assistance for Bangladesh, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Pakistan, Philippines, and Sri Lanka, are misused by units of the security forces of such countries against civilians, including civilians who are members of political opposition parties and human rights groups." bdnews
