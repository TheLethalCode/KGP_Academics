<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com) -- The government Tuesday decided to withdraw troops from the Dhaka University campus, a day after a spell of violence left about 200 people, mostly students, injured. The pullout begins at 8pm Tuesday, the government said in a statement. The chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim had earlier confirmed the news to bdnews24.com after a rushed meeting at the Chief Adviser's Office. The move for army pullout from the violence-torn campus was meant to ease the nervy situation that continued through a second day. Meanwhile, angry Dhaka University students demanded a public apology from army chief Moeen U Ahmed for what they said was an unwarranted incident on the campus. General Moeen has been set a deadline to apologise to the students by Wednesday noon. From a press conference at Madhu's Canteen on the campus, the students said if the army chief did not apologise they would press ahead with their movement. The students rolled out a five-point charter of demands. bdnews24.co
