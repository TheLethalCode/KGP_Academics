<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 19 (bdnews24.com) -- The High Court Sunday granted bail to former state minister Amanullah Aman in an extortion case. A bench of Justice Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Justice Zubayer Rahman Chowdhury passed the bail order on a writ petition filed by Aman. The HC also suspended the trial-court proceedings of the case for three months and issued a rule on the home secretary and other officials to explain why the inclusion of the case in the emergency powers rules would not be declared illegal. The case has it that Aman had played a role in extorting Tk 13,500 from Swapan, son of Shahar Banu in Keraniganj on January 14, 2005. Shahar Banu filed an extortion case with Keraniganj Police Station against Aman and others on March 5, 2007. On April 15, the government brought the case under the emergency powers rules. Barrister Mahbub Uddin Khokon defended Aman in court. Joint forces arrested Aman on Feb 5 before a Dhaka court sent him to Dhaka Central Jail. Aman was sentenced to 13-year rigorous imprisonment on June 21 in a case filed by the Anticorruption Commission on charges of having wealth beyond known income and suppressing information about property. bdnews24
