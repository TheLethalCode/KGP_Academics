 AMMAN, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jordan's Finance Minister Ziyad Fariz resigned on Tuesday after the government overruled his recommendation to hike petrol prices to curb a spiralling budget deficit, officials said. Prime Minister Marouf a-Bakheet told reporters the government had rejected any new hike of petroleum products and petrol that was widely expected by the end of the month, saying it would have hurt low-income Jordanians, who make up the majority of the country's 5.6 million population. Fariz had argued that the rise in world oil prices would derail efforts to trim a budget deficit of the energy dependent economy to 2.7 percent of gross domestic product in 2007. This compares with a budget deficit of 4.5 percent of gross domestic product in 2006. Under parliamentary pressure, Fariz decided earlier this year to delay a petrol price hike agreed with the International Monetary Fund to take place last March. It would have been the last of several hikes undertaken in the last two years that would have led up to full energy price liberalisation by the end of the year. A price hike is fraught with risks in a country with a restive population and high unemployment, where in past years civil unrest has broken out after steep petrol price rises, analysts said. Fariz is a reformist who won the respect of the IMF and World Bank during stints as a key economic decision maker. The IMF had said the budget outcome would be highly sensitive to oil price developments with an oil price increase of $5 a barrel adding about one percentage point of gross domestic product to the budget deficit. The country's oil imports have soared to over a $1 billion annually and the U.S. and Gulf states cut back assistance to the government. Jordan's imports most of its energy at commercial rates from Saudi Arabia. Jordan's budget was thrown into disarray in mid 2005, when Saudi Arabia ended a 50,000 barrels-per-day oil grant to compensate for the loss of cheap Iraqi energy supplies Jordan relied on before the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. Before the outset of the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, the government cushioned its state treasury coffers by access to cheap Iraqi oil after its former oil provider Saudi Arabia severed supplies during the 1990-1991 Gulf Crisis. Traditionally, the kingdom's budget shortfalls are covered by large infusions of foreign aid to underpin the stability of the pro-US ally at the centre of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
