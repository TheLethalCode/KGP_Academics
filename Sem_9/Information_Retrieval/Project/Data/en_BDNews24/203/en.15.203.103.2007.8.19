 JOHANNESBURG, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Twenty-two people were killed in a collision between a truck and a minibus taxi that exploded into flames in South Africa, SABC radio news reported on Sunday. The taxi, which was carrying all 22 victims, hit the truck from behind and caught fire, trapping its passengers inside. The accident took place near Komatipoort, about 400 km (250 miles) east of Johannesburg. About 10,000 die on South Africa's roads each year, making the country one of the world's most dangerous places to drive. According to road safety group Arrive Alive, an estimated 4 in 100,000 people die in road accidents across Europe, compared to 25 per 100,000 in South Africa.
