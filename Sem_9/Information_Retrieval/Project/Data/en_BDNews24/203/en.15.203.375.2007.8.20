 Comilla, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com) - Law adviser Mainul Hosein Monday said the present government did not want reforms to stay in power, but to ensure a corruption-free society. "Not only in politics, the government will undertake reforms in all other areas as well," he said at a meeting in the Deputy Commissioner's Office in Comilla. "The country's economic plight is the result of a political calamity. The country was heading towards a civil war. After this government assumed power, the spontaneity of the people saved the country from a civil war." Mainul said: "Now there is no relief thief in the country. The stigma of ours being a corrupt country is fading. A revolution is going on in the country. Some problems are associated with any revolution. For this we will have to be patient for some time." Deputy commissioner for Comilla Manzurur Rahman presided over the meeting, also joined by government and non-government officials and civil society representatives. bdnews2
