 Dhaka, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com) Chairman of the National Board of Revenue Badiur Rahman Sunday criticised donors for imposing "unreasonable conditions" on the government for loans. "The Economic Relations Division would be redundant if tax collections increased to the optimum level," Rahman said in his speech to a meeting on tax management reforms, organised by Bangladesh Economic Association at the Jatiya Press Club. "We can easily manage with our own internal resources. It is not possible for any patriotic person to serve in the ERD due to donor loan conditions," he said. The NBR chairman added that if the government decided not to take any further loans it would still take 40 years to get out of foreign debt. Rahman said that 13,300 people had "whitened" Tk 2,300 crore since the government's offer to bring undisclosed money into the legal arena with a 5 percent penalty. The central tax authority has earned Tk 427 crore from the initiative, although Rahman made it clear that the offer would not be extended a further time. Quazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmed, president of Bangladesh Economic Association, said the country could move ahead without foreign loans and criticised what he said was a culture of dependency embedded in the psyche of policymakers. "The country could easily survive without foreign loans if the people only paid their tax to the optimum level," he said. "Foreign loans are not utilised for the poor, instead the money is commandeered by the few people who make these policies. "It has been fixed in the psyche of policy makers that the country cannot work without foreign assistance. "I don't see any justification to accept foreign loans as our remittance has increased from $1 billion to $6 billion." According to the latest data of the central bank, expatriates had remitted nearly $6 billion back home in fiscal 2006-07, the highest in Bangladesh's history, which is a rise from $4.8 billion a year ago. "The government used to take foreign loans amounting to $1 billion when the remittances stood at only $1 billion," Ahmed said. "The government still takes a similar amount in foreign assistance from the donors," he said. bdnews
