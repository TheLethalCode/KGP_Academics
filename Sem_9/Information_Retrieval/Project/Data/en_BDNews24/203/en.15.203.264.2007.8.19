 Dhaka, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com) -- The government has completed all formalities to free the judiciary from executive control, an adviser said Sunday. Approval for the organogram (manpower structure) of the judicial service is the latest crucial step to carve out a free judiciary, law adviser barrister Mainul Hosein told reporters after a meeting of the National Implementation Committee for Administrative Reforms. The judiciary will become "completely separate" from the executive from the day fixed by the Supreme Court for implementation of an amendment to the Criminal Procedure Codeanother important step in judiciary separation. Mainul said the NICAR meeting had also approved the organogram of the Anticorruption Commission. For the judicial service, the adviser said, an organogram of about 4,500 people has been approved. Of them, 650 are magistrates. The magistrates have been divided into two categories: judicial magistrate and metropolitan magistrate. Of them, there are 600 posts of judicial magistrate. Mainul said: "The organogram proposed by NICAR was approved after scrutiny." "Only a formal circular remains to be done. If the Supreme Court is satisfied with government work it will fix a date for implementing the amendment to the CrPC," he said. On an allegation that deputy commissioners would have no work after judiciary separation, the adviser said, "That's not true. They would not have judicial powers but would have administrative powers. The new procedure will cut workload on them." On inviting applications from general magistrates interested to work permanently with the judiciary, law secretary Kazi Habibul Awal said many have already responded. The Supreme Court detailed a 12-point directive to the government on December 2, 1999 for separation of the judiciary from the executive. The successive foot-dragging governments took repeated extensions of time for implementation of the directives. Finally the Khaleda administration, at the fag end of its tenure, made four sets of rules on judicial service. The Supreme Court, however, on January 10 ordered the government to frame fresh rules, and repealed the earlier ones because they were not framed in accordance with its directives. The present interim government framed four sets of new rules on January 16 and announced the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Ordinance on Feb 11. bdnew
