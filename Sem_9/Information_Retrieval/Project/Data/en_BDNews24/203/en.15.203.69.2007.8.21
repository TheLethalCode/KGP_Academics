 Dhaka, August 21 (bdnews24.com) - Stocks tumbled Tuesday as police-student clashes continued at Dhaka University campus from Monday evening. "The market was a bit under pressure due to the tense situation in the wake of the student protests at Dhaka University," an analyst of an asset-management company told bdnews24.com. Heavy traffic jams and halting of vehicles by students stopped many investors from trading, he said. "However, some investors locked in gains," the analyst said. Almost all the sectors led by banks fell across the board. Summit Power slumped 5.95 percent to Tk 1555 after it hit an all-time high at Tk 1653.5 the previous day. State-run power issues, however, went up on speculation that the government would sell further shares of the two entities. DESCO, the most traded issue, added 2.62 percent to Tk 1035. Power Grid gained 0.63 percent to Tk 556.2. Square Pharma having the biggest share in market capitalisation, led the downturn in pharmaceuticals stocks. Square Pharma lost 0.43 percent to Tk 3678. The banking sector that constitutes over 50 percent of total market capitalisation, fell, led by AB Bank, BRAC Bank and National Bank. AB Bank lost 6.30 percent to Tk 1976.75. BRAC Bank dropped 0.58 percent to Tk 934.75. The DGEN or general index slumped 26.33 points or 1.09 percent to 2368.81. The DSI or all-share price index was down 21.49 points or 1.07 percent to 1969.30. The DSE-20 blue chip index tumbled 25.45 points or 1.29 percent to 1937.38. Losers outnumbered gainers 147 to 43. Some 20 issues held steady. A total of 10,179,129 shares worth Tk 1.56 billion were traded. Mutual funds finished mixed but cement and IT stocks dipped. A government announcement barring internet providers from having VOIP licences affected IT stocks, said a market analyst from Equity Partners Securities. All the major indices on the Chittagong Stock Exchange slumped. Losers beat gainers 21 to 70. Some eight scrips held steady. A total of 1,104,974 shares worth Tk 116.35 million were traded. bdn
