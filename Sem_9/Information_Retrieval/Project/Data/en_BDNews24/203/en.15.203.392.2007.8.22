 Dhaka, Aug 22 (bdnews24.com)  Violence spilled into Old Dhaka Wednesday morning when students of Jagannath University clashed outside the campus with police, leaving 20 pedestrians, policemen and commuters injured. The students who had earlier declared an indefinite strike threw stones at riot police deployed on the main street of Johnson Road in front of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court. The agitators pelted stones at the Sadarghat branch office of Bangladesh Bank while chasing police. Joined by locals, the students set fire to the Nayabazar police box and attacked the Sadarghat police box. The violent mob vandalised at least 100 vehicles on the road. The demonstrators gathered at the vice chancellor's office building from 10:00am and took out a procession marching on the main streets of old Dhaka. They smashed several vehicles. Police used batons and tear gas to disperse them, but violence continued to spread to other areas. Police car driver Sohag and assistant sub inspector Manjurul Islam were injured. By 11:30am, students took control of several areas of old Dhaka including Nayabazar, Tantibazar, Sadarghat, and CMM's Court premises.
