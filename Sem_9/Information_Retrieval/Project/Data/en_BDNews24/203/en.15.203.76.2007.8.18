 BAGHDAD, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Seven people were killed when a mortar barrage hit the town of Khalis north of Baghdad on Saturday, police said. An estimated 17 mortar rounds hit the local market, residential areas and a hospital. Ali Hamid, a sewerage engineer in the religiously mixed town, was in the market when the attack took place. "It began raining bombs above our head. People in the market began running. I saw the body of an old woman lying in the street," he said. Tens of thousands of Iraqis have been killed in a wave of sectarian violence since the bombing of a revered Shi'ite shrine in the town of Samarra in February 2006. The US military launched a major offensive against Sunni Islamist al Qaeda and Shi'ite militias this week.
