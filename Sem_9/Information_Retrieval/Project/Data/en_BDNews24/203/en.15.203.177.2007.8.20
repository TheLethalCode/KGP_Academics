 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, August 20 (bdnews24.com) -- The government will auction three international gateway (IGW) and two interconnection exchange (ICX) licences among private operators in October, a top official said Monday. But no foreign company or foreign joint venture will qualify to apply for IGW or ICX licence, Manzurul Alam, chairman of Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission, said at a press conference at the telecoms ministry. "Even the non-resident Bangladeshis' business outfits are not eligible either," he said. "Only the companies fully owned by resident Bangladeshi citizens are qualified for these international telecoms licences." The retired major general said fixed or mobile phone operators also cannot contest in this race. But the state-owned Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board (BTTB) gets the IGW and ICX licences by default being the incumbent international services provider. BTRC will invite applications from mid-September and will organise a pre-bid meeting after two weeks followed by holding the auction in October sometime after the Eid-ul-Fitr. The private international phone services are expected to begin in mid-2008. The regulatory chief has outlined a two-tier international licensing regime for the private sector international telecoms services. The proposed three IGW facilities will be connected with the submarine cable of BTTB. All of them will be installed in Dhaka. BTRC will issue two separate licences for interconnection exchange (ICX) in Dhaka, which will be linked with the three IGW facilities. The ICX operator will establish similar facilities in smaller scale in Chittagong, Sylhet, Bogra and Khulna. The incumbent fixed and mobile operators' overseas calls will first terminate in one of the six ICXs. Then the calls will be processed in the IGW and get routed to the overseas destinations via BTTB's submarine cable. Similar path will be followed for the inbound calls from abroad. "The operators will install 'lawful interception equipment or LIE' in their facilities to help the government for monitoring the international calls," said the former major general who had also served in the military intelligence. The IGW and ICX operators are the two "middlemen" in the government's privatisation plan for overseas telephony. Will they not make the calls expensive for consumers? The BTRC chairman said his organisation will "strictly regulate" the international tariff the way it has been regulating the mobile phone charges. The government's new international telecoms policy strongly discourages the use of very small aperture terminal or VSAT for private overseas communications via satellite. "We will assess the justification of using VSATs on a case-by-case basis and decide accordingly," Alam said. The regulatory chief said the IGW operators may use BTTB's backup link via satellite if BTTB's only submarine cable gets shut down. "We have to live with it until the country links another undersea telecoms cable." The BTRC chairman said the government is "seriously exploring" to get the second submarine cable. Alam has admitted that interconnection problem challenges the government's roadmap to privatise the international telecoms services. "BTTB and Grameenphone have not been fully complying with the interconnection law. But an effective interconnection regime has been stipulated in the new licences to ensure level-playing field." He has admitted that BTTB and Grameenphone are charging "very high prices" for their nationwide transmission capacity. But the regulatory chief has denied the allegation of "imposing" the International Long Distance Telecommunication Services (ILDTS) Policy-2007 without public consultation. "The policy is not a rigid document and the telecoms ministry can modify it anytime." Alam also faced the questions of "not consulting the people in international telecoms business" while formulating the policy. "BTRC has consulted many resource persons and academics within the short time," he said. This is the first time the regular, instead of the ministry, has prepared a policy. Section 33 of the telecoms law says, "The functions of the Ministry shall be to determine the general policy of the Government in the telecommunication sector and to encourage the development of that sector in Bangladesh." bdn
