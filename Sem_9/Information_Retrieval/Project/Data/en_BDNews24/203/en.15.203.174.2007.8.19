 Dhaka, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com) -- Incompetent judges, who were appointed on political considerations by previous governments, must resign, speakers told a discussion Saturday. A social campaign against such judges could be a powerful tool to force them to resign their posts, they said. The speakers sought intervention from the chief justice as temporary remedies. The Citizens' Rights Movement, a civil-society outfit, organised the discussion on "Irregularities in Appointing Judges and the Role of Chief Justice" at the National Press Club. Justice Syed Amirul Islam, who returned to legal profession after retirement as judge, said the civil society could put pressure on the authorities to remove the "incompetent judges". Columnist Syed Abul Maksud Ahmed asked the chief justice to keep the "controversial judges" off duty. Abed Khan, editor of Bangla-language daily Samokal, said the judiciary's lost pride should be restored. In a paper, Tushar Rehman, secretary general of the outfit, said people should have the right to point fingers at "controversial officials and judges". bdnews24.com/m
