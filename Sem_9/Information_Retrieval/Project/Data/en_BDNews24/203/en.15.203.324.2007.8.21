 MUMBAI, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former India captain Kapil Dev has been sacked as chairman of the national cricket academy for refusing to give up his involvement with an unapproved Twenty20 league being launched this year. "The board has expelled Kapil Dev and all the players and officials who are with ICL (Indian Cricket League)," a senior Indian cricket board official, who did not wish to be named, told reporters. He said a news conference would be held later on Tuesday. Kapil, one of the game's great all-rounders who led India to a World Cup victory in 1983, had refused to step down as chairman of ICL's executive board after the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) refused permission for the league. Former India players Madan Lal, Erapalli Prasanna, Kiran More, Balwinder Sandhu and Sandeep Patil are among those who have joined the league's board or as coaches. Former Pakistan skipper Inzamam-ul Haq and players Mohammad Yousuf, Abdul Razzaq and Imran Farhat have signed up despite the Pakistan cricket board, like India and Sri Lanka, threatening players with bans. Retired West Indies skipper Brian Lara was the first big name to sign up for the league, promoted by India's Essel Group which owns the nation's largest listed media firm, Zee Telefilms Ltd
