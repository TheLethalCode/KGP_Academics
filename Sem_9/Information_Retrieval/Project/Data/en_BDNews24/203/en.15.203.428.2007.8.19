 KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China hit back hard after Indonesia drew first blood in the mixed doubles finals on Sunday at the world badminton championships, winning the men's singles through Lin Dan and the women's singles with fifth seed Zhu Lin. In the mixed, Indonesian second seeds Nova Widianto and Lilyana Natsir beat top seeds Zheng Bo and Gao Ling 21-16 21-14 after the Chinese failed to produce their best badminton. With the help of some powerful smashes from in-form Widianto the Indonesian pair ran out worthy winners. But China got on the board when Zhu beat Hong Kong's sixth seeded Chen Wang 21-8 21-12 in the women's event, avenging Wang's semi-final defeat of Chinese top seed Zhang Ning. Defending men's champion Lin, appearing in the final for a third successive year, controlled affairs against Indonesian ninth seed Sony Dwi Kuncoro in the first game but had to battle all the way in the second to record a 21-11 22-20 victory. Sony trailed 12-7 in the second but fought back to lead 19-17 only for Lin to produce two brilliant smashes and a fine piece of net play to avert the crisis and keep his crown.
