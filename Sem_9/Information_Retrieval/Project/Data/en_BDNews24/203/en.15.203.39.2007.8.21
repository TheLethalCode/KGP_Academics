 NEW YORK, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Wall Street stocks opened lower on Tuesday after US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said he saw no quick solution to problems in the credit markets, while bonds held early gains. Paulson, speaking prior to the open of regular US stock exchange trading, also said the global economy is strong and liquidity will return to normal once investors re-price risk. After the market open, the Federal Reserve said it added $3.75 billion of temporary reserves to the banking system through overnight repurchase agreements. The dollar declined slightly against the yen after Paulson's comments. US Treasury issues held steady at higher levels. At 10:01 a.m. (1401 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was down 16.99 points, or 0.13 percent, at 13,104.36. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 0.30 points, or 0.02 percent, at 1,445.25 and The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 2.05 points, or 0.08 percent, at 2,510.64. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was off 0.3 percent to 1,477.52. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei share average earlier rose 1.1 percent to close at 15,901.
