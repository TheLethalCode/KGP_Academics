 NEW DELHI, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian oil workers called off a strike for higher wages within hours of it beginning on Tuesday, while oil companies said there was no serious impact on production, refining and fuel supplies. More than 45,000 oil workers, including managers and senior executives, at India's leading oil firms had gone on strike from the early hours of Tuesday, demanding more than double their current pay and their perks to be tax-free. S. Sundareshan, a senior official at the Indian oil ministry, said the government had agreed to raise an advance payment allowance to 60,000-120,000 rupees ($1,460-$2,930) from 50,000-100,000 rupees. In September 2006, the same oil workers' union called a strike, but called it off after the government promised to look into their demands for higher wages. "Whatever the government has offered last night as an ad hoc payment has been considerably improved, so we have withdrawn the strike," said Ashok Singh, convener of Oil Sector Officers' Association, an umbrella union for industry employees. State-run explorer Oil and Natural Corp chairman R.S. Sharma said oil production remained unaffected. "We are now working on the finer details of the settlement," Sharma said. Smaller oil company Bharat Petroleum Corp said its refineries were running at 100 percent capacity, but Hindustan Petroleum Corp said earlier its refining operations had been affected. Top refiner Indian Oil Corp. had said on Monday its refineries could reduce production at its 10 refineries. ($1 = 41.0 Indian rupees) bd
