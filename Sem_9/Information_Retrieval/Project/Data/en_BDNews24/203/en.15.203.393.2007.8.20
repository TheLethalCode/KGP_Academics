 Dhaka, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com)  The Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC) Monday approved 11 projects, including construction of the Tk 10,162 crore Padma Multipurpose Bridge. The 10 other projects, including preparation of a voter list with pictures and national identity cards, are to cost Tk 2,988 crore. ECNEC chairman and chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed chaired the meeting, the first of its kind in fiscal 2007-08. "Construction of the Padma Multipurpose Bridge is a high priority national project," finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam told reporters after the meeting. Azizul said: "The bridge will contribute a lot to the economic development of the south-western part of the country that has remained quite neglected since long." He said that the bridge would connect the whole region with the capital Dhaka. Of the Tk 10,162 crore needed, Tk 6,881 crore would come from different development partners as project assistance. "The Asian Development Bank will make a detailed design of the bridge under a technical assistance project of the Bank," the finance adviser said. Planning secretary Jafar Ahmed Chowdhury said land acquisition for the bridge would start this year. Chowdhury said construction work would begin in 2009 and end in 2014. According to the feasibility study by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the 6.01-km-long Padma Bridge is to be constructed at the Mawa-Janjira point, some 35 km south of Dhaka. Meanwhile, preparation of voter list with photo and national identity card is to cost Tk 581 crore, including Tk 345 crore in project assistance. Replying to a query, the finance adviser said that there would not be any significant cut in the total outlay of this year's Annual Development Programme despite extra spending for flood rehabilitation work. Among other projects cleared by the ECNEC are: rehabilitation and modernisation of units 3,4 and 5 of the Ashuganj power plant worth Tk 940 crore, water resources development project in greater Mymensingh, Faridpur and Sylhet worth Tk 454 crore and the Tk 553 crore 2004 flood damaged rural infrastructure development project.
