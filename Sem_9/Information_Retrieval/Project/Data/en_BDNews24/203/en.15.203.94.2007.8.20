 NEW DELHI, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian Oil Minister Murli Deora said on Monday oil workers had rejected the government's request to call off a planned strike starting Tuesday. "It is very unfortunate that our appeal to the oil sector officers' association has not been accepted by them," Deora told reporters after a meeting with union leaders. Indian Oil Corp chief S. Behuria said: "The impact on refinery throughput as a result of the strike will be known the day after tomorrow."
