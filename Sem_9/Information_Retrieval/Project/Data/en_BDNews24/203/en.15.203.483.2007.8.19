<TITLE> Thais approve new army-drafted charter: exit poll </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A healthy majority of Thai voters approved an army-drafted constitution on Sunday designed to prevent a repeat of the powerful single party government of ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, an exit poll showed. A survey of 20,200 voters nationwide by the Suan Dusit polling agency suggested 68 percent of Thailand's 45 million voters had approved a replacement for the 1997 "People's Constitution" torn up in last September's military coup. Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont, appointed after the military ousted twice-elected Thaksin, said passage of the draft with a turnout of "more than half of voters" meant elections would be held in December as planned. "Elections will definitely be held at the end of the year," Surayud said in a televised national address after polls closed in Thailand's first ever referendum. The army-backed government has already pencilled in Dec. 16 or Dec. 23 as the most likely election dates. Neither Surayud, exit polls nor television stations gave a more precise indication of turnout -- a key factor in a poll that Thaksin dubbed "fruit of the poisonous tree" from exile in London. Election Commissioner Sodsri Satayatham said as voting started she believed the turnout would exceed 70 percent. Although approval needs only a simple majority, a low turnout would be a serious embarrassment for the government and an endorsement of Thaksin, still hugely popular in the countryside which swept him to successive election victories. Fearing Thaksin's lingering influence, the government launched a massive "Yes" campaign, with 400,000 military personnel to persuade people to vote for the charter. Many voters also appeared motivated by a desire to hasten a return to democracy in the hope of ending nearly two years of political turmoil that started with anti-corruption street campaigns against Thaksin. "MANAGED DEMOCRACY" Passage would be a relief to many Thais who have watched with dismay the turmoil that erupted when Thaksin's family sold its controlling share in the telecommunications empire he founded for a tax-free $1.9 billion to Singapore in January 2006. Financial analysts said the stock market should rise on Monday, especially given Friday's rally on Wall Street. Analysts say the charter is designed to restore rule by the elites challenged by Thaksin, son of an ethnic Chinese silk merchant, and rekindle the "managed democracy" of the 1980s under ex-army chief Prem Tinsulanonda -- now the King's top adviser and seen by the Thaksin camp as the coup mastermind. "The most important thing now is for Thais to be reconciled," Prem said after voting. "I hope the referendum will end misunderstanding among Thais, leading them to a clean and fair election and narrowing their different opinions." A majority vote against the constitution, drafted by a council appointed by the military, would have allowed the army to impose any one of Thailand's previous 17 constitutions. Coup leader and army chief Sonthi Boonyaratglin said on Friday that if the charter were rejected, it would take him "a couple of days" to pick his favourite. Election officials expect to have a preliminary result late on Sunday and an official count on Monday
