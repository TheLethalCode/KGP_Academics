<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 20 (bdnews24.com)  Stocks shot up Monday as investors, ignoring watchdog advice to avoid rumours, rushed to bag shares over speculations that the bull-run would continue. Heavyweights Square Pharma, DESCO, BRAC Bank, Summit Power and AB Bank paced the gains, blessed by the entry of new funds from banks, real estate and savings instruments. "It appears that the market is driven by demand. Stagnancy in various sectors of the economy has prompted many investors to come in and reap the benefit of capital gains," Mahmood Osman Imam, who teaches finance at Dhaka University, told bdnews24.com. "The behaviour of a lot of investors to chase the trend is also fuelling the shares," he said. Shares surged in the morning to midday trade pulling the benchmark index as much as 80 points up, although the Dhaka Stock Exchange asked investors to make investment decisions not based on rumours, but on fundamentals and information disclosed by the companies. Profit taking in the last spell, however, helped the market calm down a bit. The power sector finished mixed as Power Grid Company of Bangladesh slipped on profit-taking. DESCO, the most traded issue, gained 4. 39 percent to Tk 1008. In the six-month period up to June, it reported an earning of Tk 35.38 per share. Summit Power remained upbeat on its right share announcement and growth prospects despite its reported Tk 15.86 earning per share in the January to June period. Summit shares ended at an all time high of Tk 1653.5, up 5.11 percent. Square Pharma re-bounded and climbed up 7.10 percent to Tk 3694. Mutual fund and banking stocks ended up but cement stocks finished mixed. BRAC gained 1.75 percent to Tk 940.25. Half-yearly results and a plan to establish an electronic money transferring company pulled AB Bank shares 7.80 percent up to close at Tk 2109.75. A senior official with the DSE, who preferred not to be named, warned investors that a market correction could well turn the newcomers into losers. "Obviously there will be correction for the way the shares are going up. There is a chance of both losses and gains. Late entrants will become more and more vulnerable," he said. The DGEN or general index finished at 2395.15, up 51.71 points or 2.20 percent. The DSI or all-share price index rallied 40.62 points or 2.08 percent to 1990.80. The DSE-20 blue-chip index surged 54.38 points or 2.84 percent to 1962.84. Losers however beat gainers 110 to 92. Some 14 issues held steady. Buying spree pushed turnover to Tk 1.93 billion against trading of 1,07,24,812 shares. The Chittagong Stock Exchange also rallied amid buying pressure. A total of 26,51,365 shares worth Tk 254.0 million traded. Of the issues traded on the CSE, 62 gained, 46 lost and nine finished unchanged. bd
