 Dhaka, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com)  Army chief General Moeen U Ahmed Tuesday called for an alternative, broader syndicate of importers of essentials to curb the runaway prices. "A syndicate that would sell commodities at lower prices to people has to be created," Moeen said, adding the nation cannot remain hostage to a handful of importers. The army chief asked banks to give loans and other facilities to the importers and blamed the bankers for panicking the businessmen and the ordinary people. "The banks do not give loans to the new importers for import of commodities. The banks give loan only to the syndicates that have been built up over a long period. "Commodity import has to be encouraged by building new syndicates and providing them loans. "The bankers have created panic among the businessmen and common people by saying that they would not be allowed to withdraw more than Tk 5 lakh." The army made the remarks at a meeting with the chairmen and managing directors of 29 private banks at the Bankers Association of Bangladesh office in Banani. Turning to the flooding, he said: "All have to face the floods together. The government is trying its level best. This time there is no corruption in distribution of relief. "The floods damaged the infrastructure and agriculture sectors the most. All will have to stand by the hapless farmers so that they can overcome their losses soon. "The banks will have to come forward to encourage the farmers in different agro-based industries and agricultural production," Moeen said. On electricity crisis, the army chief said, "The power crisis is a major problem of the country. Instead of looking at the foreign investors to solve the problem, the local entrepreneurs will have to come forward. "The private banks will have to give syndicated loan for setting up power units. Besides, the people will have to prevent waste of electricity by using energy-saving bulbs. "The foreign mobile companies have taken away huge amounts of foreign currency. If the entrepreneurs had invested in this sector taking syndicated loans, the money would have remained in the country." Citing traffic jams as the main problem in Dhaka City, he said, "In a city of one crore 20 lakh people everything has been built in an unplanned way. In making any plan, one will have to think what will happen after 10 years. "Expressway and more flyovers have to be built in the capital to remove the traffic jam. For this, the banks will have to give syndicated loans to local entrepreneurs." "Thirty crore hands of the 15 crore people have to be utilised. Every person will have to be built up as a skilled person through proper training. "Every bank will have to take up new projects which will contribute to building skilled manpower and creating new employment." bdnews24.
