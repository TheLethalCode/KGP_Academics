 KARACHI, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan all-rounder Abdul Razzaq has announced his retirement from international cricket, giving credence to media speculation that five leading Pakistani players are set to join the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL). Razzaq told Geo television from London on Monday that he had decided to retire in protest over the Pakistan Cricket Board's indifferent attitude. "They dropped me from the Twenty20 World Cup squad and I was very upset and disappointed. But none of them bothered to call me up and tell me why I was dropped," the 27-year-old Razzaq said. "Their attitude has hurt and disappointed me a lot which is why I have decided to retire from international cricket," he added. Razzaq, who has appeared in 46 tests and 231 one-day internationals, denied that he had signed up to play in the ICL Twenty20 tournament, saying he had received an offer but had yet to make a decision. Former captain, Inzamam-ul-Haq, Mohammad Yousuf, Imran Farhat and Azhar Mahmood are the other four players being linked with the ICL. The Twenty20 World Cup is being held in South Africa from Sept. 11-24
