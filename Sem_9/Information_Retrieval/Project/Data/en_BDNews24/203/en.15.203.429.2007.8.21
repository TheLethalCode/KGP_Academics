 Dhaka, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com) More than 100 students were injured in violent clashes with troops and police Monday night after Dhaka University students burst into protest against army action, witnesses said. At least 50 students were taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital for treatment. Police teargassed and charged the angry students with batons after the violence spread through the campus, turning it into a "battlefield" as a witness described the situation. Police also used rubber bullets to calm the situation, several witnesses said. A quick effort by the university authorities failed to calm down the melee as bdnews24.com correspondents and photographers at the scene said the situation turned extremely violent. The protesting students demanded withdrawal of the army camp from the campus and declared a strike for Tuesday at the university. They said if their demand was not met, they would go on indefinite strike. In the wake of the army beatings, about 300 students gathered in front of the central library on the campus and announced the plan for the strike. A student of the international relations department spoke on behalf of the students. Some angry students vandalised a police car on patrol. The students and police concentrated the battle between F Rahman Hall and Nilkhet crossing at 9:30pm as authorities put up barricades on all entry points to the campus. The campus was made off-limits to traffic. The students of F Rahman Hall burnt newspapers to protest the police action, said bdnews24.com correspondent Mokarram Hossain Shuvo from the scene. Police raided Surya Sen Hall and beat students in a late-night crackdown. bdnews24.com correspondent Jannatul Ferdous Tanvi said the police pushed their way into the DU medical centre and DMCH and beat the students who took shelter there from police beatings or gathered for treatment. The action came after a group of students marched to the army camp and pelted it with stones. The troops countered the students with batons. A student, named Majedul Islam, broke his leg in the beatings. On the other front of the battle, some other angry students shouted slogans against the army as a contingent of police stood guard in front of the residence of the vice chancellor apparently for a fight. bdnews24.com correspondent Prodip Choudhury said the police lobbed at least 25 teargas shells in half-hour's time to control the tempers of the students. They said the police tried to maintain order. The troops swung into action after students demanded public apology from an army man for verbally abusing a student when they were watching a football match in the DU playground. A bdnews24.com correspondent was among the witnesses to the incident. Police stepped in later and beat students when they took out a procession to press their demand for army pullout. The injured students were taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. The incident appeared to be an irony. The same day, Dhaka University and the National Defence College held a discussion on how to improve the army's relations with civilians. Acting vice-chancellor for DU AFM Yusuf Haider told bdnews24.com that he had held a meeting with army officers after the incident. He said the army officers regretted the incident. bdnews24.com correspondents Golam Mortuja Antu, Liton Haider and Rohan Ziad were also on the scene. bdnews24.com/jf/mar
