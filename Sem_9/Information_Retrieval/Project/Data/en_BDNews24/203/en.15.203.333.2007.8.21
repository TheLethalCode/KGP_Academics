 Dhaka, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com)  Police fired teargas Tuesday to quell protests that spilled into its second day amid a strike at Dhaka University as more than 1,000 angry students marched through the troubled campus. The marauding students smashed several vehicles at Shahbagh and Nilkhet on the fringe of the campus as the overnight battle raged on. The demonstrators also set fire to an army car in front of Aziz Super Market in Shahbagh. They attacked an army driver who suffered head injuries and was taken to hospital. The Dhaka University Teachers Association has thrown their weight behind the students demanding army pullout from the campus. The association, after an emergency meeting, demanded the army camp be withdrawn from the campus by Wednesday noon, said Professor Akhteruzzaman, a member of the association. The university Syndicate also sat in a meeting to review the situation. Sirajul Islam, convenor of the provost standing committee, speaking separately to reporters, condemned Monday night's police action at the dormitories. In another development, a military press statement said Tuesday the army officer, accused of assaulting a university student Monday on the university playground, had been withdrawn from the camp on the DU campus. An investigation has also been opened against the officer, a statement of the ISPR said. The protests spilled over into other institutions including the Jahangirnagar University, as students boycotted class and put up barricades on Dhaka-Aricha highway for a while. They smashed several passing vehicles on the highway and briefly clashed with police. The protests are the first major defiance of the restrictions clamped under the emergency rules. The students of the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) linked their hands on their campus to protest the army action on the DU students. They also announced a protest meeting on the BUET campus for Wednesday. More than 100 students were injured in violent clashes with troops and police Monday night after the students burst into protest against army action. bdnews24.com correspondents and photographers said the situation on the DU campus became volatile Tuesday morning after students came out of their dormitories defying tight security. Some 1500 policemen were deployed on the campus to quash the demonstrations. The students gathered in front of the Aparajeyo Bangla in the Arts Faculty building and then marched through the campus, carrying at least two effigies of the army chief General Moeen U Ahmed. But it was not clear immediately if the protesters had burned the effigies. The protesters then moved toward the TSC but the security officials fired teargas on them as they reached Begum Rokeya Hall. The students dispersed and gathered in front of the home of the vice chancellor and started throwing stones at it. Acting vice chancellor AFM Yusuf Haider tried to tame the protesting students but in the face of unrelenting protests he went back home without much success. bdnews24.com/gma/ans
