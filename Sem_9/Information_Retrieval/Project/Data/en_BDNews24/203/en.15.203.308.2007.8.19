 ASTANA, August 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev's party won every available seat in a new parliament, results showed on Sunday, in an election that further tightened his grip over the Central Asian state. Kazakhstan has never held a vote judged free and fair and the Soviet-style 88.05 percent share of the vote for Nazarbayev's Nur Otan party, dubbed the party of bureaucrats, left democracy advocates with little hope to cling to. Six other parties in Saturday's poll all failed to reach a 7 percent hurdle required to enter the lower house, the Mazhilis, including the main opposition All-National Social Democratic Party (ANSDP) which received 4.62 percent of the vote. "Kazakhstan has taken a real step towards democracy," the presenter on state-controlled Khabar Television said after a live broadcast of the preliminary results. An opposition source said the ANSDP was digesting the results: "We're trying to formulate a statement that does not contain swearwords." The opposition said it had evidence of electoral fraud but, unlike parties in Ukraine and Georgia that called protests to oust entrenched leaders after rigged ballots, it cannot command large crowds to take to the streets in Kazakhstan. Nur Otan will control 98 seats in the 107-seat parliament. A further nine seats are to be filled by nominees from a Nazarbayev-appointed body, the Assembly of People of Kazakhstan. The old parliament, elected in 2004, had just one moderate opposition member but also included other parties and independents, now banned, who supported Nazarbayev. POLL MONITORS Saturday's poll for the Mazhilis set the 67-year-old former Soviet apparatchik's wish to keep a tight grip on the vast country against his desire to be viewed in the West as a reforming international statesman. Monitors from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) were due to give their verdict on the poll later on Sunday. Ahead of the announcement of the results by Central Election Commission chairman Kuandyk Turgankulov, the ANSDP said it had gathered photographic evidence of a range of violations including multiple voting and campaign literature for Nur Otan in polling stations. Hopes of greater plurality in parliament had been based on Nazarbayev's desire for Kazakhstan to chair the OSCE, a 56-member democracy, rights and security body, in 2009. He has faced opposition due to his poor record on democracy. He called the election two years early after enacting constitutional changes that hand the lower house more powers such as naming the prime minister. They also removed any limit on how many terms he can serve as president. bd
