 SANTIAGO, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chile striker Marcelo Salas received a surprise call-up on Monday for next month's European tour after nearly two years out of the national team. Salas, 32, who stopped playing altogether for the first six months of this year, was one of 13 home-based players named by new coach Marcelo Bielsa for the matches against Switzerland and Austria. Chile's all-time leading scorer with 35 goals, Salas was last picked away for a World Cup qualifier away to Brazil in September 2005 but missed the game through injury. The former Lazio and Juventus striker's career has been plagued by injury in recent years. However, he has made an impressive return with his club side Universidad de Chile and scored with a back-heeled goal in a 5-2 win over Deportes Concepcion at the weekend. Bielsa, who led Argentina at the 2002 World Cup, was named as coach earlier this month, replacing Nelson Acosta who resigned following a 6-1 loss to Brazil at the Copa America in Venezuela. Chile face Switzerland on Sept. 7 and Austria four days later, both games in Vienna. In October, they are away to Argentina in their first match of the 2010 World Cup qualifying competition
