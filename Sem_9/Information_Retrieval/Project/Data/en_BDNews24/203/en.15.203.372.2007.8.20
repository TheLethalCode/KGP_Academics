 BAGHDAD, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The governor of the Shia southern Iraqi province of al-Muthana was killed in a roadside bombing that targeted his convoy on Monday, officials in the province said. Governor Mohammed Ali al-Hassani was on his way from Rumaitha to Samawa, the provincial capital, when his convoy was attacked, they said. At least five of his bodyguards were wounded. Hassani is the second Shia governor killed this month in what appears to be a Shia infighting. He was a member of the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council (SIIC), the biggest Shia party in Iraq, whose armed wing, the Badr organisation, has been in conflict with the Mehdi Army militia of the Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. Diwaniya governor Khalil Jalil Hamza, who was also a member of SIIC, was killed along with the province's police chief earlier this month. A vehicle curfew was imposed on Samawa shortly after Monday's bombing
