 MALE, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Maldives President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom claimed victory on Sunday in a poll to decide which democratic model the island chain will adopt, in a vote seen as an acid test for Asia's longest serving ruler. The remote Indian Ocean island chain best known as a luxury honeymoon destination and playground for Hollywood stars like Tom Cruise, is choosing between a British-style parliament and a US-style presidency to reform an autocratic system. With much of the vote counted, 81,854 people had voted for the presidential model Gayoom advocates and 48,981 in favour of the parliamentary system the main opposition had billed as a vote against the man who has ruled for 29 years. There were no details on how many of the 176,500 eligible voters had turned out for the poll. "The people have spoken. I think this is an overwhelming endorsement of President Gayoom and show of public support for his reform agenda," chief government spokesman Mohamed Shareef told Reuters. "It would take a miracle now to change the result." Gayoom, who aides say will run again in the first multi-party election due next year, and his Dhivehi Rayyithunge Party (DRP) endorsed the presidential model but his opponents say he is dragging his feet on pledged reforms and say it is time he went, and backed a parliamentary system. Gayoom's DRP and the main opposition Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) accuse each other of voter intimidation and breaking election rules. Election officials said ballot papers were short at some stations, and ordered a recount of one ballot box, but said overall the vote appeared to be fair. "It is an ill-gotten result so far," said MDP spokeswoman Mariya Didi, who said her party was not conceding and would wait until all votes were counted. "Look at how they used state media, bribery, corruption, voter intimidation and threats to withhold jobs. "It comes as no surprise. The MDP always said giving ballot boxes to election officials appointed by the president was like taking Dracula to the blood bank." RIGHTS RECORD Gayoom's critics say he is stalling on implementing a raft of democratic reforms pledged in late 2004 to revamp the power structure in the face of harsh criticism of the government's rights record. His opponents billed a vote for a parliamentary system as a vote for him to quit, saying revenues from 89 luxury island resorts -- some charging well over $1,000 a night for rooms on stilts over azure lagoons -- are not benefiting the half of the population who live in poverty on a dollar a day. "The money is not distributed to the people. There are no rights for workers, we have a lot of problems," said 35-year resort worker Zara, who gave a nickname for fear of retribution for speaking out against Gayoom. "We don't even have electricity on my native island." Zara earns $200 a month working at a luxury resort island, and must rely on tips from customers to supplement his income. "He is not a good president, he has been cheating the public. I wanted change," he added, traditional wooden ferries bobbing in clear waters behind him that have made the cluster a top scuba destination. Dissent has also flared within the ranks of Gayoom's cabinet, which under existing rules he handpicks and appoints. Two leading members of his government quit earlier this month, accusing him of stalling on a new constitution and judicial independence in a country that only legalised the existence of political parties in 2005
