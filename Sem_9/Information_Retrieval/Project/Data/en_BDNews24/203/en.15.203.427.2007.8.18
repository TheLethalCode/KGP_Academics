 Dhaka, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com) - Defender Isa Mia and goalkeeper Jahid Hossain have been appointed captain and vice captain for the Bangladesh team in the 7th Asia Cup to be held in India from August 31 to September 9. The decision was taken at a governing body meeting of the Bangladesh Hockey Federation Friday. Bangladesh will start their campaign playing against Thailand of Pool B, which also comprises hosts India, Korea, China and Sri Lanka, on August 31. Bangladesh will play their second match against China on September 1, third match against Sri Lanka on September 3, fourth match against India on September 4 and the Pool last match against Korea on September 6. Pakistan, Japan, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore will compete in Pool B of the 11-nation tournament. "The National Sports Council (NSC) is providing Tk 14.32 lakh out of the revised budget of Tk 17 lakh, and the BHF officials will provide the remaining money to complete the participation," BHF treasurer Abdur Rashid Shikdar told reporters Saturday. "The meeting had planned to send the team by road to Chennai because of the shortage of money, but one of the BHF vice presidents has desired to provide additional money for the air tickets so that the players can start the tournament in fresh mood," said Shikdar. He further said, "To reduce the expenditure, some of the BHF officials were also bearing the daily expenditures of the camp for two days and they would continue it until the team leaves for India." "BHF vice presidents Shahriar Alam, Monir Ahmed and Shaheen Mahmud have taken the responsibilities to manage the sponsors for its National Youth Hockey, School Hockey, Shaheed Smriti Hockey, Independence Day and Victory Day Hockey Tournaments," said the BHF treasurer.
