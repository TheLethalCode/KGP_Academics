 Dhaka, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Tuesday demanded an explanation from the government on why some rules of the emergency powers rules including those on denying bail and confiscating property should not be declared unconstitutional. A High Court bench of Justice Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Justice Zubayer Rahman issued the rule on a writ appeal filed by Abdul Quddus Mondal of Natore. The court also stayed the proceedings of an extortion case against Mondal. The home secretary and other civil servants have also been asked to explain in eight weeks why the inclusion of the extortion case under the emergency powers rules should not be declared illegal. bdnew
