 Dhaka, August 19 (bdnews24.com) -- Dhaka stocks Sunday ended down as market heavyweight Square Pharma plunged on its ex-dividend day. Losses in two major players, Lafarge Surma Cement and Power Grid Company of Bangladesh, compounded the fall. Square Pharma, the biggest scrip by market capitalisation, plunged 24.89 percent to Tk 3449.25, due to a lift on price limit restrictions in its shares trading on the ex-dividend day. Square had earlier issued 50 percent cash and 50 percent stock dividends for the year ending March 2007. Market trends, however, remained bullish as other blue chips in the pharmaceuticals, power and cement sectors bagged in gains. Banking stocks, which constitute over 50 percent of total market capitalisation, finished up. They were buoyed by gains in Uttara Bank, AB Bank, BRAC Bank, National Bank and IFIC Bank. AIMS of Bangladesh fund manager Yawer Sayeed said the market carried upbeat due to the injection of funds from banks, real estate and savings instruments. Sayeed said: "Low credit demand from banks, price hikes in the real estate sector and a 10 percent tax on savings instruments has brought investors to the market." "Good corporate postings, merchant banks' loan extension and the steady entry of new shares also inspired investors to come in," he added. Summit Power, the mostly traded issue, continued rallying following its right share announcement. It climbed 5.42 percent to reach a one-year high of Tk 1573. DESCO added 0.52 percent to end Tk 966. UCBL, one of the mostly traded issues, fell 1.94 percent to Tk 3598. Uttara Bank surged to a one-year high, adding 10 percent to end Tk 3022.25. The DGEN or general index was down 17.90 points or 0.75 percent to 2343.43. The DSI or all-share price index narrowed its losses due to gains in Rupali Bank and IFIC Bank. The DSI finished at 1950.17 down 0.52 points or 0.02 percent. The DSE-20 blue-chip index tumbled 115.20 points or 5.69 percent to 1908.45.
