<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com) - Awami League's acting president Zillur Rahman said Saturday the Election Commission should discuss with political parties before preparing the voter list. "Preparing the voter list is not possible without the cooperation of the leaders and workers of political parties," he told reporters at his Gulshan home. Zillur repeated the demand for withdrawal of the ban on parlour politics saying: "If the ban is not lifted, discussion with the Election Commission is not possible." Replying to a question he said: "Nothing is progressing properly. However, we are ready to do everything possible for the welfare of the country and the nation." On Awami League president Sheikh Hasina's intention to talk with her son, daughter and sister, Zillur said, "The jail code clearly says that if anybody wants to talk with relatives by phone they can do so. We request the government to give her the opportunity to do so." Zillur said Awami League leaders and workers would lay flowers on the site of the August 21 grenade attack on Hasina's rally on Bangabandhu Avenue. A milad mahfil will be held at his home in memory of his wife Ivy Rahman who died after being fatally wounded in the attack. The AL leaders and workers will also go to the homes of some of those injured in the same grenade attack. bdnews24.c
