 Dhaka, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com)  Angry students of Dhaka University late Monday chased a senior army official on the campus when he had gone to talk to them introducing himself as a teacher of the university, witnesses said. The official, a brigadier general, took two teachers of the university with him at 11:45pm to pacify the protesting students who rampaged through the campus for hours on end. The students however recognised and swore at him before they started kicking and pushing him. The official finally fled by a motorcycle, according to two bdnews24.com correspondents who witnessed the incident. DU assistant proctor Nazmul Ahsan Kalimullah was at the scene along with another teacher. The incident occurred on the street between the vice-chancellor's house and the Teachers' Club when the angry students elsewhere on the campus were fighting with the security officials. The students swooped on another security official, who tried to save the troubled army officer. The second man left the scene with a bleeding head, the witnesses said. bdnews24.com/pc/
