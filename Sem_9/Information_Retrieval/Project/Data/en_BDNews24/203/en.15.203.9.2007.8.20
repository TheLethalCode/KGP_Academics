<TEXT>
 MADRID, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sevilla got the new season off to a glittering start when they claimed their fifth trophy in a little over a year after a 5-3 win over Real Madrid in the second leg of the Spanish Super Cup at the Bernabeu on Sunday. A hat-trick from leading striker Frederic Kanoute and a double from Brazilian midfielder Renato earned Juande Ramos's side a 6-3 aggregate victory over the Spanish champions. Sevilla have won back-to-back UEFA Cups, the King's Cup and the European Super Cup in the space of the last 15 months. Real, who have overhauled their squad since Fabio Capello was sacked after steering the team to the league title last season, looked ragged and disorganised throughout and new coach Bernd Schuster will have plenty to do before the league begins next week. It was the second time that Schuster has fallen victim to Sevilla at the Bernabeu in the last two months. The German's former club Getafe lost to the Andalucians in the final of the King's Cup in June. Sevilla, 1-0 up after last week's first leg, made a confident start against a sluggish-looking Real, taking the lead when Renato steered home unopposed in the 17th minute after some slack defending from a free kick. Real barely threatened the Sevilla goal in the opening quarter, but they equalised out of the blue thanks to a spectacular goal from new signing Royston Drenthe. The former Feyenoord player looked up and cracked a fierce drive off the underside of the bar and into the net from close to 30 metres out. RESTORED LEAD But Sevilla restored their lead five minutes later, Renato notching up his second when he got between the Real centre-backs to head home after Duda had spun a fine cross into the area. Real were still reeling from the blow when Sevilla were awarded a penalty after new signing Pepe handled as he battled to clear the ball from the area. Kanoute, who had scored in each of Sevilla's previous four trophy victories, made it five out of five when he sent Iker Casillas the wrong way with a coolly taken spot kick to put his side 3-1 up in the 38th minute. The first-half action was not over yet, however, and Real narrowed Sevilla's lead just before the break when Fabio Cannavaro powered in a header at the far post after a Wesley Sneijder free kick. Schuster threw playmaker Guti on at halftime and Real began to play more fluently, levelling the game when former Sevilla player Sergio Ramos headed in 12 minutes from time. But Kanoute put his side in front again four minutes later, making the most of a misunderstanding between Pepe and Casillas to slot home from close range. Real were reduced to 10 men soon after when Pepe ended a forgettable home debut with a red card and Kanoute took immediate advantage to complete his third when he slotted home in injury time
