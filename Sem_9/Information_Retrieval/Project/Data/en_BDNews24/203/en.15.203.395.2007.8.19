 MIRANSHAH, Pakistan, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan army helicopters pounded two militant hideouts near the Afghan border on Sunday, killing three pro-Taliban fighters, a military spokesman said. Major General Waheed Arshad told Reuters the pre-dawn attack continued for several hours near Mir Ali town in the North Waziristan tribal region. "They were carrying out attacks on security forces from the two compounds and we're targeting them," Arshad said. He said three militants were killed in the strike, though intelligence officials in Mir Ali said two women and two children also died. Meanwhile, in neighbouring South Waziristan, tribal elders and clerics were making efforts to secure the release of 16 paramilitary soldiers abducted on Aug. 9. Both South and North Waziristan are regarded as hotbeds of support for al Qaeda and Taliban. Violence has intensified since July, following the break down of a 10-month peace deal with militants in North Waziristan and the storming by the army a radical mosque in the capital, Islamabad. Ten soldiers and 17 militants have been killed in bomb attacks and clashes in the Waziristan region since Thursday. More than 200 people, most of them soldiers and policemen, have been killed in the northwest since last month. The violence is one more headache for President Pervez Musharraf as he seeks re-election for another five-year term, expected next month or in October
