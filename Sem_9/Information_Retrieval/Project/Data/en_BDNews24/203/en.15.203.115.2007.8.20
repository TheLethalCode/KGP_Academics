 MADRID, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bernd Schuster promised a return of spectacular, crowd-pleasing soccer to the Bernabeu when he took charge of Real Madrid after the dismissal of Fabio Capello in the close season. But the German is unlikely to have envisaged the sort of entertainment that accompanied his home debut as he watched his team slump to a 5-3 defeat to Sevilla in the return leg of the Spanish Super Cup on Sunday. Trailing 1-0 after last week's first leg, Schuster had been talking up his side's chances of staging a comeback, but it was Sevilla who stole the show with an ultra-efficient display of clinical, attacking soccer. The Andalucians became the first side to score five goals at the Bernabeu since Real Mallorca in the 2002-03 season thanks to a hat-trick from leading striker Frederic Kanoute and a neat double from Brazilian midfielder Renato. Although Real managed to score three, they were never given a look-in by Juande Ramos's side, who secured their fifth trophy in the space of just 15 months. Schuster said he was not worried by the defeat, but his brusque replies in the post-match news conference gave a different impression. "I don't understand why you journalists keep interfering in our work," the German said in a response to a question about why playmaker Guti was not in the starting line-up. "I don't interfere in your job because I haven't got the qualifications. You can't judge anything because I'm the one that works with the players every day. Asked about whether he was concerned about his team's defensive lapses, Schuster replied by criticising the referee and said he was more worried about the team's lack of firepower up front. "It is too easy to blame the defence when you concede five goals, but there were some general errors leading up to the goals and the referee was at fault too. "What I'm most preoccupied about is that we aren't creating any chances." Schuster has less than a week to rectify the problems before his side take on Atletico Madrid in the opening game of the season. If they fail to beat their city rivals next Saturday, the German will find himself with some even more difficult questions to answer
