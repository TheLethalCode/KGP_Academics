 BAGHDAD, August 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A mortar attack killed 10 people and wounded 28 more in the Shia eastern Baghdad district of al-Obeidi on Sunday, police said. At least four mortar rounds fell in al-Obeidi, which is close to Sadr City, a sprawling Shia slum and stronghold of powerful anti-American cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. Tens of thousands of Iraqis have been killed in sectarian violence since the bombing of a revered Shia shrine in the town of Samarra in February 2006. That attack sparked waves of reprisal attacks between Iraq's majority Shias and minority Sunni Arabs, who were dominant under Saddam Hussein. The US military last week launched a major new nationwide offensive targeting Sunni Islamist al Qaeda and Shia militias, who they fear will step up attacks ahead of a key report on the Iraq war due to be presented to Congress soon. The latest offensive is part of a push announced earlier this year of 30,000 extra US troops. That security crackdown is meant to buy time for Iraq's fractured Shia-led government to reach a series of political benchmarks aimed at promoting national reconciliation between Iraq's warring sects. US President George W Bush said on Saturday that, while political progress was being made at a local level, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's government still had many important measures to resolve in order to meet those goals. US ambassador Ryan Crocker and General David Petraeus, commander of US forces in Iraq, will deliver the progress report to Congress in mid-September. bd
