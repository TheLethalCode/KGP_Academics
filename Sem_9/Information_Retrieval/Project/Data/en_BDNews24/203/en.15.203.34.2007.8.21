 Dhaka, August 21 (bdnews24.com) -- The dollar extended gains against the taka for a second day Tuesday as demand in the inter-bank foreign exchange market rose due to increased pressure for import payments ahead of Ramadan and the Eid, fund managers said. The dollar traded at Tk 68.60-Tk 68.70 Tuesday against the taka, up from Tk 68.52-Tk 68.60 Monday. "The market appears to remain under pressure a bit this week. We are now clearing payments of letters of credit opened to cater for the month of Ramadan," said a fund manager for a private bank, asking not to be named. He however felt that the increase was acceptable. "This rise is reasonable," he said. The inter-bank foreign exchange market has been upbeat in exchange rates since August 19, the beginning of the week, when the greenback traded at Tk 68.50-Tk 68.55 against the taka. A shortfall in the inflow of export proceeds and remittances pulled the demand up, fund managers said. "The dollar rate went up as buyers outpaced sellers," said a senior official of a foreign bank. bd
