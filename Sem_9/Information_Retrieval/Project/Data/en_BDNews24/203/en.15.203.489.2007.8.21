<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com)  Troops pulled out from their Dhaka University camp Tuesday night amid a fresh spell of violence that spread to parts of the city. At least 10 army cars moved out of the camp at 10:40pm, bdnews24.com correspondents reported from the scene. The pullout came hours after the government decided to withdraw troops from the DU campus, concerned by two days of violence that had injured about 200 people, mostly students. The move for pullout from the violence-torn area was meant to ease the nervy situation, but it apparently did not calm the angry students. The latest violent incident was reported in F Rahman Hall where students clashed with the police, prompting rounds of teargas shells, bdnews24.com correspondent Jannatul Ferdous Tanvi reports. Meanwhile, violence spread to other parts of the city, especially Dhanmondi, where protesters burnt two motorbikes, creating panic in the area. In an early statement, the emergency government decided to open a judicial inquiry into the violent incidents at Dhaka University. The army has already started an investigation into the incident that took place at the Dhaka University playground Monday, according to the statement. "The probe will end soon and action will be taken against the persons responsible as per the findings of the investigation," the government said in the statement. The statement said the government had regretted the incident and appealed for calm and discipline on the campus. The chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim had earlier confirmed the news to bdnews24.com after a rushed meeting at the Chief Adviser's Office. The chief adviser and other caretaker advisers, the army chief, home secretary, pro-vice chancellor of Dhaka University, chiefs of law-enforcement agencies and military and other officials were present. DEMAND FOR APOLOGY Meanwhile, angry Dhaka University students demanded a public apology from army chief Moeen U Ahmed for what they said was an unwarranted incident on the campus. General Moeen has been set a deadline to apologise to the students by Wednesday noon. From a press conference at Madhu's Canteen on the campus, the students said if the army chief did not apologise they would press ahead with their movement. The students rolled out a five-point charter of demands, including the army pullout from the campus. bdnews24.com/mhs/j
