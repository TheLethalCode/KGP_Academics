 RIO DE JANEIRO, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Central defender Lucio has been ruled out of Brazil's friendly against Algeria on Wednesday because of a bruised left knee, the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) said on Sunday. The Bayern Munich player, a World Cup winner in 2002, will be replaced by uncapped 22-year-old defender Miranda, who plays for Brazilian champions Sao Paulo, the CBF said in a statement on its Web site. Brazil face the North Africans in Montpellier, France, in their first match since they won the Copa America in Venezuela last month. The game marks the return of Ronaldinho and Kaka, who both asked to be rested from the Copa America in a move widely criticised in Brazil. Brazil and Algeria last met in the 1986 World Cup when a goal by Careca gave Brazil a 1-0 win
