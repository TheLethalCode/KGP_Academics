<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Bank Sunday said it would stand by its tight monetary policy despite sharp opposition from businesspeople and economists. "Now a U-turn on the policy may fuel inflation," BB governor Salehuddin Ahmed told reporters after a seminar on "Inflation in Bangladesh: The evidence and policy alternatives" organised by the central bank at the CIRDAP auditorium. Ahmed said the banks have about Tk 10,000 crore in excess liquidity. "A loose monetary policy will be like ghee to fire," he said, using the metaphor to describe the roiling money market. Ahmed said the current private sector credit growth was nearly 16 percent. "The growth should not be more than this for now," he said. The central bank governor's comments came after economists and businessmen demanded a change to the existing monetary policy, which they said hurting investment. "Please don't go for contractionary monetary policy for the sake of the economy," Prof Muinul Islam of Chittagong University, said. Islam said the government should go for massive credit disbursement, especially in agriculture, to overcome the "shaky and panicky" situation. "Contractionary policy will be a disaster to the economy," BGMEA president Anwar-Ul-Alam Chowdhury told the seminar. Debapriya Bhattacharya, executive director of a nongovernmental think-tank, Centre for Policy Dialogue, said: "Contractionary monetary policy is not suitable for us at the moment." Bhattacharya said the government should beg people to invest and import more to avert the current ongoing crisis in the economy. He also said investment, credit growth, food import, stocks and consumption have all gone down in the recent months. The governor said the monetary policy pursued by the BB aims at supporting the highest sustainable output growth while maintaining price stability, adjusting smoothly to internal and external shocks faced by the economy. "Monetary policy is designed around a projected real GDP growth rate and a moderate level of CPI inflation attainable without unduly depressing output," Ahmed told the seminar. bd
