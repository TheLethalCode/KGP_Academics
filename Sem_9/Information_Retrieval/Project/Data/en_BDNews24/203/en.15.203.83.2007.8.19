<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Aug. 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A court-martial will start Monday for a US Army intelligence officer charged with abuses at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison, where he headed the interrogation center, the Army said on Saturday. The trial of Lt. Col. Steven Jordan will be convened at Fort Meade, Maryland, outside Washington, the Army said. Jordan is charged with cruelty and maltreatment of detainees as well as making false statements and obstruction of justice, disobeying a superior officer and failure to obey orders. The charges stem from violations of the Uniformed Code of Military Justice alleged to have taken place at the Joint Interrogation Debriefing Center at Abu Ghraib on or about September 17, 2003 to August 19, 2004. A lawyer for Jordan could not immediately be reached for comment. The court-martial is being convened by the commander, Joint Force Headquarters for the national capital region and US Army Military District of Washington. An investigation of prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib carried out by Army Maj. Gen. Antonio Taguba in 2004 described Jordan as one of several directly or indirectly responsible. A preponderance of evidence showed Jordan failed to prevent the unauthorized use of dogs and the humiliation of detainees kept naked for no acceptable purpose while he was a senior officer in charge, among other failings, Taguba said. Between May 2004 and September 2005, seven US troops were convicted of Abu Ghraib-related offenses, sentenced to prison and dishonorably discharged from service. Brig. Gen. Janis Karpinski, the commander of Abu Ghraib, was demoted to the rank of colonel in 2005. She denied knowledge of the abuses
