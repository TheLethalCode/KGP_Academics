<TEXT>
 KHARTOUM, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sudan has broken up a group of Sudanese plotting to attack the French, British, US and UN diplomatic missions in Khartoum, caught most of them and seized arms and explosives, the state news agency SUNA said on Monday. SUNA quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Ali al-Sadig as saying late on Sunday that the authorities had caught all but two of the group and were continuing the search for them. A senior ministry official met French, British, U.S. and U.N. diplomats in Khartoum to tell them of specific threats against them by Sudanese arrested last week with grenades, explosives and other weapons, SUNA said. The official briefed the diplomats on "events related to some groups recently arrested with explosives who were targeting these specific embassies", SUNA quoted Sadig as saying. "The government is completely committed to offer the (embassies) all the protection possible to allow them to work in safety and security," he said. Justice Minister Mohamed Ali Mardi told reporters that the government was keeping the embassies informed of events. "The minister of foreign affairs will tell them ... the safeguards that are given and the precautions taken by the government of Sudan for the safety of the diplomats and the employees of these embassies, at least to make them feel safe," he said. Interior ministry sources said last week that the Sudanese police had arrested eight Sudanese in connection with the discovery of three weapons caches in the capital, containing mainly grenades and ammunition. Britain's Foreign Office warned Britons on Saturday not to travel to Khartoum because of heightened fears that Western interests might be attacked. The British embassy told Britons living in Sudan to be vigilant and review their security arrangements. It closed its public services on Sunday and Monday and cancelled its regular Thursday night social club.
