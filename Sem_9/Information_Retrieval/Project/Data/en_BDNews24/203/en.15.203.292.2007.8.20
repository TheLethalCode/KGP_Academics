<TITLE> South Korean right to name candidate for president </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SEOUL, August 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korea's opposition conservatives on Monday name their candidate for December's presidential election, which opinion polls show they are almost certain to win. Former Seoul Mayor Lee Myung-bak, 65, who rose from poverty to become a high-flying executive at the centre of the country's economic transformation, is the projected winner, the national daily JoongAng Ilbo said based on its survey of party members. The official results of the Grand National Party's (GNP) primary are expected to be released at 0730 GMT. But GNP leaders are nervous that the viciousness of the nomination campaign fought by the two main contenders could cost them votes and their commanding lead in the race to take over the presidential Blue House. For months, the favourite to win the GNP nomination has been Lee, whose projects to beautify the architecturally bland capital during his stint as its mayor have been a major factor in his popularity. But he has more recently been targeted by prosecutors -- and GNP opponents -- over suspect land deals more than a decade ago, allegations that threaten to tarnish his reputation. His main rival Park Geun-hye, the 55-year-old daughter of a former dictator and hoping to be South Korea's first woman president, almost closed the gap with Lee in polls taken in the final days before the party primary. "When the primary is over, I want to meet with Park and talk about joining forces to change government," Lee was quoted by local media as saying. But the lingering distrust was clear, with the two attacking each other up until the vote on Sunday. GNP leaders met late last week to draw up an agreement that the losing camp would accept the outcome of Sunday's vote and not undermine the winner's bid for the presidency. Under election laws, the primary loser cannot run as an independent in the presidential race. "Many people are disappointed at how violently they clashed up to the primary," Yonsei University politics professor Yang Seung-ham said. Opinion polls show two out of three voters will support the GNP presidential candidate, which indicates the country is set to bring in its first conservative leader in a decade. The conservatives, with the promise of lower taxes and pro-business policies, have seen their support grow as that of left-leaning outgoing President Roh Moo-hyun has faded. Both have also promised to take a harder-nosed approach to communist North Korea if it steps out of line, though in general they support the engagement policy adopted by the past two governments. Judging by opinion polls, neither has much to fear from the splintered left, whose top presidential candidates have at best mustered 5 percent support. The former ruling Uri Party on Monday re-emerged under a new name after joining forces with civic leaders and defectors from minority liberal parties. Uri, formed less than four years ago as a vehicle to support Roh, fell apart due to dwindling support. While Lee has won favour as a can-do politician, Park has a built-in support base from the legacy of her father, President Park Chung-hee, who took power in a 1961 coup and led the drive to make the country an economic powerhouse. She was acting first lady after her mother was shot dead by a bullet meant for her father. President Park was assassinated five years later. Park supporters say the link has strong appeal to the older generation but resonates less well with younger voters, for whom the Park Chung-hee presidency is a reminder of the country's despotic past.
