 Dhaka, August 21 (bdnews24.com)  Political parties Tuesday marked the third anniversary of the brutal grenade attacks on an Awami League rally with a renewed demand for a fair investigation into the gruesome political killing. On Aug 21, 2004, unidentified assailants launched an assault on an anti-terrorism rally in front of the AL's headquarters on Bangabandhu Avenue, leaving 22 party activists dead and at least 500 wounded. The then opposition leader Sheikh Hasina narrowly escaped death but had her eardrums damaged. Tuesday's commemoration was a low-key formality since a state of emergency is in force, barring all forms of political gathering. The brief commemoration began with placing of wreaths at a memorial plaque on Bangabandhu Avenue. The Awami League and its front organisations, the Workers' Party of Bangladesh and the Sammyabadi Dal placed the wreaths. Many of the maimed victims of the attacks also visited the place. Awami League acting president Zillur Rahman again accused the previous BNP-Jamaat-e-Islami coalition government of masterminding the attack, an allegation the parties have denied. "We demand the interim government open an investigation into the mayhem afresh and bring the assailants to justice," Zillur said as he along with senior party leaders visited the scene of the violence. He regretted his party chief not joining them. Hasina has been detained in a special jail pending trial on charges of corruption. "It's really sad that she isn't here with us today," Zillur told reporters before leaving the scene. After the Awami League paid respects to the victims, Dilip Barua from Sammyabadi Dal and Rashed Khan Mennon, Bimal Biswas and Haider Akbar Khan Rano of the Workers' Party of Bangladesh placed wreaths at the plaque. "Sheikh Hasina, the main target of the August 21 attack, is now in jail. This government must prove whether a rule of law will be in the country or not," Menon said. "We demand a proper investigation into the August 21 attack," he said. bdnews24
