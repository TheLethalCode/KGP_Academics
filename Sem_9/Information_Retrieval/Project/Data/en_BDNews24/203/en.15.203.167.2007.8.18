 BAGHDAD, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraq's political leaders were set to meet on Saturday to try to end an impasse that has stymied national reconciliation efforts and left Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's national unity government in tatters. Maliki is under growing pressure from the United States, which is frustrated by negligible political progress. The leaders of Iraq's Shi'ites, Sunni Arabs and Kurds are unlikely to agree on all or many of the thorny issues up for discussion, but the summit is seen as a final chance for them to show whether they can finally put aside loyalty to sect or ethnic group to work together. The summit will bring together Maliki, President Jalal Talabani, a Kurd, Sunni Vice President Tareq al-Hashemi, Shi'ite Vice President Adel Abdul-Mahdi, and Masoud Barzani, president of the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region. Maliki and Hashemi were seen arriving at Talabani's house in Baghdad's Karrada district at about 4 p.m. (1200), indicating that the summit would probably get under way shortly. Maliki and Hashemi do not get on, with the Sunni Arab politician often complaining that the prime minister ignores his suggestions and even refuses to interact with him. At one meeting, Maliki left the room rather than speak to Hashemi. "This week may witness a significant step which may help in solving the problems," said one Iraqi official. The summit follows the formation this week of a new alliance between the four leading Shi'ite and Kurdish parties, a voting bloc in parliament that cuts across ethnic and sectarian lines and is aimed, said Maliki, at "shaking the political paralysis". But the four parties were unable to persuade the biggest Sunni Arab party, the Iraqi Islamic Party, to join them, leading U.S. ambassador Ryan Crocker and other observers to question the credibility of an alliance without Sunni Arabs. The Iraqi Islamic Party is the biggest party in the Accordance Front, the Sunni Arab bloc that pulled out of Maliki's cabinet last week in protest at his failure to address their demands for a greater say in government. "Among the issues that will be addressed today are the demands of the Accordance Front and their participation in the government. So far, we feel that their decision of leaving is not final and could be reversed," the Iraqi official said. A long-standing Sunni Arab demand for the constitution to be amended will also be discussed, he said. Sunni Arabs, politically dominant under Saddam Hussein, have accused Maliki's government of marginalising them. Since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 that toppled Saddam they have formed the backbone of the insurgency. Recently though, a number of tribal sheikhs have formed an alliance with the government against Sunni Islamist al Qaeda, a move that has helped to pacify restive Anbar province in Western Iraq, once the most dangerous region for U.S. troops. Washington has said it hopes that drawing Sunni Arabs more firmly into the political process and addressing their grievances will help ease sectarian tensions that have, by the most conservative count, killed tens of thousands. It has urged Maliki to pass laws on sharing oil revenues and easing restrictions on former members of Saddam's Baath party serving in the army or civil service. But Maliki has lost nearly half his cabinet since April: the Accordance Front and Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr's movement have pulled out their ministers, and ministers loyal to former Iraqi prime minister Iyad Allawi are boycotting meetings.
