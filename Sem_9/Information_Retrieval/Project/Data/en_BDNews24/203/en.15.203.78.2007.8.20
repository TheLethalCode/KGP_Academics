<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League Monday demanded that people with "direct or indirect ties" to the August 21 grenade attack be punished. The party's acting president Zillur Rahman described the cases filed against Sheikh Hasina as conspiratorial, false and fabricated. From a press conference at his Gulshan home, he demanded immediate withdrawal of the cases for continuation of the rule of law. Zillur without naming the Jamaat said, "Instead of arresting groups against which there were specific allegations of patronising militants, extortion and corruption, an adviser was speaking in their favour. This is sad and unwarranted." Criticising the government, Zillur said, "The people expect that a people's government will be established through a free, fair and neutral elections in the quickest possible time, and in a terror and corruption-free environment. "The government formed thus will uphold the spirit and values of the liberation war, and pave the way for building a non-communal, prosperous Bangladesh free from hunger and poverty. It is expected to try the really corrupt, communal militants and plunderers. But "unfortunately, Sheikh Hasina who had contributed to the changeover of January 11 with her tireless, unmatched and bold work and sacrifice" is now behind bars in "conspiratorial, fabricated and false cases", he said. Zillur alleged that the law enforcement agencies did not arrest the attackers though the grenade attack had been conducted in their presence. "The evidence of the attack was willfully destroyed," he alleged. The AL acting president said: "The then alliance government did not accept the case filed by the Awami League as it (the alliance government) was involved in the attack." Motia Chowdhury, Ataur Rahman Khan Kaiser, Abdul Mannan, Akhteruzzaman, Dr Mostafa Jalal Mohiuddin and Dr Dipu Moni were present. bdnews
