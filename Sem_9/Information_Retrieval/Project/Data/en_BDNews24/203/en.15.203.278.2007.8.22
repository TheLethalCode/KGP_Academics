 Dhaka, August 22 (bdnews24.com)  A rickshawpuller died in police firing at Rajshahi University as violent student protests over Monday's army assault at Dhaka University raged across universities and colleges Wednesday. Dhaka University, Rajshahi University, Chittagong University, Government Azizul Haque University College in Bogra, BL College and Government Azam Khan Commerce College in Khulna, and BM College in Barisal became restive as students clashed with police, correspondents report. Violence broke out at Rajshahi University Wednesday morning as students demanding withdrawal of the law enforcers from the campus clashed with police. Students locked in fights with police for a third day at Dhaka University at around 12:30pm after a brief respite in the morning. Jahangirnagar University also burst into protests for a second day as students blocked the Dhaka-Aricha Highway. Agitated students at Rajshahi University ransacked and vandalised the Administrative Building, Shahidullah Arts Building, Senate Building and the frontage of the vice chancellor's home, cutting off its telephone, power and cable TV connections. Clashes began when police stopped a procession of some 20 students initially marching off from Shahidullah Kala Bhaban in front of the Administrative Building. A rickshawpuller took a bullet as he was waiting in front of the university medical centre to carry students injured in police beatings. He died on the way to Rajshahi Medical College Hospital. Students also attacked a police box and blocked roads on the campus. Clashes also took places in residential halls. Hundreds of demonstrators took out a procession at Chittagong University in the morning and vandalised the police box at the railway station and arts faculty, commerce faculty and social science faculty buildings. Violence erupted as police fired teargas shells to disperse the students who vandalised the glasses and furniture of the union building. Agitated students took position at the rail station, Shaheed Minar and various faculties. The protesters also smashed a bus and a CNG autorickshaw. Two teachers of the university were injured when students threw stones at police. Classes in most of the colleges on the port city remained suspended. Students at Government Azizul Haque University College blocked the eastern part of the college. The road block created huge traffic.
