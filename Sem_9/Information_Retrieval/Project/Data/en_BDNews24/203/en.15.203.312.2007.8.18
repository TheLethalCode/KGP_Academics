 Dhaka, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com) - Fears of a further deluge in parts of the country deepened Saturday after some rain-fed rivers continued to swell amid reports that flood victims were facing an acute shortage of safe drinking water. Diarrhoea and other diseases rampaged through the worst-hit eastern zone of Dhaka in the wake of a severe water crisis. A bdnews24.com correspondent during a visit to the eastern zone found that the floodwaters had overwhelmed the water supply system by WASA. Health adviser ASM Matiur Rahman had earlier held WASA responsible for "spreading waterborne diseases". "It doesn't matter whether the WASA agrees or not. The fact is, it's spreading the diseases," he said. The water supply infrastructure of WASA is rudimentary in most of the places in the capital and its suburbs. The adviser said the council of advisers in a recent meeting asked the water supply authority to repair its rundown underground infrastructure as soon as the floodwaters recede. "It must be done as quickly as possible," he said. As many as 18 more people died overnight raising the official death toll from this year's flooding to 554 Saturday. Officials at the cholera hospital in Dhaka's Mohakhali said most patients came in for treatment Saturday from the eastern part of the capital. At least 10,000 people struck by diarrhoea and other waterborne diseases went to hospitals across the country in the 24 hours to Saturday noon, according to the Directorate of Health. River waters along the Jamuna and Ganges basins rose Saturday, the official Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre said, adding that a strong monsoon in Indian states of West Bengal and Bihar are causing incessant rains. But the rains are expected to ease in the battered Indian states in a couple of days, said the centre in a bulletin, referring to a forecast by the Indian weather office. The floods are likely to worsen in Manikganj, Munshiganj, Faridpur, Rajbari, Madaripur, Shariatpur, Gopalganj, Chandpur and Nawabganj in the next 24 hours. But the rivers around the capital did not rise Saturday, it said. Doctors at the diarrhoea hospital run by the ICDDR,B said they got most patients from eastern Dhaka. Doctors said polluted water is causing most of the waterborne diseases. Shahadat Hossain, a doctor in the ICDDR,B, said availability of safe drinking water is a must to address the diarrhoea menace. "If that's not possible, the flow of patients will remain as it is now," he said. Many of the patients from the area said they fell sick as they are being forced to drink polluted water. CRISIS IN EASTERN ZONE Many hand-pulled tube-wells connected with WASA lines are still under water in some areas of Dhaka's eastern zone. Water in many parts stink and many residents are compelled to bathe or wash their household appliances with polluted water. In Madinabagh area under Sabujbagh, bdnews24.com correspondent Mokarram Hossain Shuvo found seven rickshaw-pullers suffering from diarrhoea and other diseases. Yunus, an owner of a rickshaw garage, said he wades through knee-deep water to reach home every day. His two sons have been suffering from diarrhoea while his wife from fever for days. "We don't have safe drinking water. We get bad odour from stagnant water around my home," Yunus said. "Now we drink water after boiling. But many can't do that because they have no money to buy fuel," he said. Fatema came to the ICDDR,B hospital from South Badda to treat her grandchild. She said her family drinks boiled water but they could not do that always. "Many in our neighbourhoods are suffering from diarrhoea," she said. According to the health directorate, about 3,400 people have been struck by diarrhoea across the country in the past 24 hours. In a statement, WASA director Shahidul Islam said WASA workers were ferrying water on vans, trolleys and tankers in some parts of the city. "We couldn't reach drinking water to many places, still under flood water," he said. bdnews24.com/mhs
