<TITLE> Market turmoil offers Sarkozy challenge, opportunity </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PARIS, Aug 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Global market turmoil poses risks to French growth but gives President Nicolas Sarkozy a chance to hone his image as a man of action, determined to inject new dynamism into the economy. Hectic activity after his May election means that, even before his first 100 days in office are up on Thursday, Sarkozy has passed a series of laws, including huge tax cuts and a guarantee of minimum service during public transport strikes. Opinion polls show his popularity is high -- which is just as well since tougher reforms lie ahead, including changing pension rules to make people work longer and overhauling labour laws to make them more flexible and streamlined. Sarkozy must also square promised budget deficit cuts with the prospect that disappointing growth may result in lower tax revenues than expected, particularly if financial market turbulence persists and drags further on economic activity. But even this new risk to his well-laid plans is unlikely to deter the hyperactive Sarkozy, who has yet to come across a problem which cannot be converted into a public relations triumph, analysts said. "There is not a lot that he believes is out of his reach," said Laurence Boone, European economist at Barclays Capital. "The economic outlook may be less bright than when he was elected but that's not necessarily an impediment to proceeding with structural reforms and even gives him an argument to stress the urgency of such reforms." Sarkozy has already made clear he is not prepared to allow financial market turmoil to hold his economic plans hostage. On holiday last week, he fired off a letter telling German Chancellor Angela Merkel that the Group of Seven industrial nations should discuss ways of improving market transparency. While he said he did not expect the real economy to be affected by market turmoil -- a line that Economy Minister Christine Lagarde hammered home on a subsequent publicity blitz -- his government is keen to show its readiness to act. Lagarde and Prime Minister Francois Fillon will meet bankers next week to ensure rising financial market risk aversion won't prevent small firms from continuing to obtain credit. The government will follow up the tax breaks voted before the summer break with more steps to lift growth, for example corporate tax credits to encourage investment in research and moves to boost exports and competitiveness. It will also unveil measures to ensure all homeowners receive tax breaks on home loans, even though a court dealt setback to the government's first stab at achieving this. But despite the barrage of policy initiatives, some things may be beyond even Sarkozy's capacity, analysts said. "Things are really on a knife's edge at the moment for France, as for Germany and other countries, and even though Sarkozy has good intentions, he can't fight market turbulence of this scale," said Maryse Pogodzinski, economist at J.P. Morgan. "He forgets there is an economic reality beyond France's borders and thinks he can do everything and control everything. It is just his personality but here he is facing something which doesn't depend on him and is much bigger than him." Economists said turbulence on the global financial markets had so far not been extreme enough or protracted enough to inflict too much damage on French economic activity and added that Sarkozy should press on with much-needed economic reforms. "Reforming the tax system and the structure of the economy will be much more important than the current turbulence, which is likely to have a limited impact on the economy," said Laurent Calvet, associate professor at HEC business school near Paris. "The reforms of the labour market are politically very tricky but providing more flexibility there is quite a critical next step." But the risk is that more aggravated market turbulence could end up hurting growth, which economists already expect will struggle to achieve even the bottom of the government's 2.0-2.5 percent forecast for this year. While Sarkozy's government is putting a brave face on the situation for now, it will have its work cut out to deliver budget deficit reductions promised to other euro zone countries. The silver lining in this fiscal cloud may be that Sarkozy now has scope to blame any budget slippage on international market turmoil and can domestically present any budget clash with Brussels as a fight to defend national interests. "For him the challenge will be just be more exciting," said Boone at Barclays Capit
