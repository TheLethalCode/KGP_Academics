 Dhaka, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com) -- An unknown group attacked education adviser Aiyub Qaudri's Dhanmondi home Tuesday night as a fresh spell of violence spread in the neighbourhood. The adviser was at home when the attack came at 10:45pm, police constable Salam Moral who was on duty there told bdnews24.com. Nobody was injured in the attack, the education adviser's wife said when she talked to bdnews24.com by phone from their Road No. 7/A home. Dhanmondi police chief Monwar Hossain told bdnews24.com correspondent Liton Haider on the scene that the attack had come from a procession. "Some people hurled brickbats at the house," Hossain said. Security was tightened after the adviser contacted the police control room for more forces. Constables Salam Moral and Alamgir Hossain were on duty at the house, but they were overwhelmed by the sudden attacks that had smashed windowpanes of the building. The attackers also vandalised the two guardrooms of the house. bdnews
