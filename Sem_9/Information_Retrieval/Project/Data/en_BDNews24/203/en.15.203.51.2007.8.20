<TEXT>
 KATHMANDU, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A packed bus skidded off a mountainous road and fell into a gorge in western Nepal on Monday, killing 22 people. Police said dozens of passengers were also hurt when the bus tumbled 250 metres (820 feet) off a narrow road about 200 km (125 miles) west of the capital, Kathmandu. Hundreds of people are killed in road accidents every year in the impoverished Himalayan nation, which has about 17,000 km (10,600 miles) of poorly maintained roads.
