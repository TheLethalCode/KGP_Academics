<TEXT>
 ATHENS, Aug 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Greek investigator has found government officials mishandled a structured bond affair that has rocked Greece for months but stopped short of naming individual culprits, Greek papers reported on Wednesday. The head of Greece's committee against money laundering, George Zorbas, has been investigating the sale of structured Greek government paper to several state pension funds, in a scandal that analysts say may have prompted snap elections on Sept. 16. "It is obvious that there are strong indications of acts of bribery," the Zorbas report said, according to extracts published in the major dailies Eleftherotypia, Ta Nea and other papers. The report said finance ministry officials knew the bond would be sold on, profits made by the intermediaries "were extremely high" and that there were witness testimonies indicating money ended up with an unnamed political party. At the centre of the affair that has dominated media headlines since March is a 280 million euro, 12-year structured government bond, with an initial 6.25 percent coupon issued in February this year and underwritten by JPMorgan . The bond passed through the hands of several brokers before ending up with state pension funds. Intermediaries included London-based North Asset Management, HVB Bank in Athens and the Acropolis brokerage. A public prosecutor in June ruled that more than 60 people are to face criminal charges for their role in the sale of government bonds to pension funds at inflated prices but no one has yet been named.

Zorbas, head of the Commission against Money Laundering, was due to appear before parliament on Aug. 21 to answer questions about his report. With the snap polls announcement, parliament was dissolved before Zorbas could appear. "After the latest developments no citizen in this country can have the slightest doubt that Karamanlis was forced to call elections. He is systematically trying to cover up the huge structured bond scandal," said main socialist opposition PASOK spokesman Yannis Ragousis. There was no immediate government reaction to the report which Zorbas submitted to the chief appeals court prosecutor. Karamanlis, whose party leads by 1-2 percentage points in opinion polls, called elections six months ahead of schedule, saying he was seeking a fresh mandate to push on with economic and social reforms. The leaked report, even though it does not name specific individuals, sparked a media frenzy, with papers running headlines such as "Zorbas bomb smashes government" and "Zorbas bomb burns New Democracy". In June, the funds accepted an offer by underwriter JPMorgan to buy back the bond after the government promised to compensate them for interest they would have earned had they put the money in a central bank deposit inste
