 Dhaka, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com)The government has sought $150 million (about Tk 1,050 crore) from donors in aid to cope with the flood aftermath, a top official said Sunday. Officials urged the donors to release the fund on an emergency basis for post-flood rehabilitationapart from their committed funds for development in Bangladesh. Finance secretary Mohammad Tareque briefed donors and other international organisations on the floods that ravaged major parts of Bangladesh, at a meeting at the Planning Commission Sunday. And the food and disaster management ministry appraised the donors in detail of the damage wrought by the recent floods. "The finance secretary asked the donor community for the additional help urgently," Economic Relations Division secretary Aminul Islam Bhuiyan told reporters after the briefing session. World Bank country director Xian Zhu said the donors had been closely observing the devastating flood situation in Bangladesh. "We also agreed to help Bangladesh with additional aid. But the size of that assistance hasn't been determined yet," said Zhu, also coordinator of donor representatives in Bangladesh. "We are also assessing the flood damage on our own," he said, adding that the amount of additional assistance would be announced after integrating the flood damage data. According to the finance secretary's briefing, the government will spend funds, equivalent to 0.8 percent of GDP, on post-flood rehabilitation. Urgent assistance from the donors at this "critical juncture" is required for maintaining the overall economic stability and fulfilling the growth targets, Bhuiyan said. He told donors that the government may have to borrow additional amounts from banks, leading to further inflation, in the wake of the disastrous flooding. Private sector investments may also shrink, and the government's development programmes may be hampered, which may mean the annual development programme may eventually have to be curtailed, he said. According to the food and disaster management ministry report, up to August 18, the floods affected 1.05 crore people in 39 districts. The death toll numbered 554. Standing crops on 7.55 lakh acres were totally destroyed and crops on another 7.62 lakh acres were partly damaged. Over 2,800km of highways, motorways and roads suffered serious damage, while 72 bridges and culverts were completely washed away. To initiate rehabilitation work in all the fields, the requested funds were urgently needed, the ministry said. bdnews24.c
