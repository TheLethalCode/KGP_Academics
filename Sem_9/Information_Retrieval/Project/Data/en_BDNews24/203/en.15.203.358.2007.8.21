<TITLE> UK fund may have to sell assets due to subprime </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A vehicle run by UK hedge fund Solent Capital Partners LLP that invested in US residential mortgage-backed debt has become the latest in a string of firms hit by the subprime mortgage crisis. The Mainsail II vehicle said on Monday it may be forced to sell assets, because it has been unable to raise short-term funding due to volatile markets. "Market volatility and lack of market liquidity with respect to subprime lending markets" meant Mainsail II could not raise funding in the commercial paper markets and was forced to draw on backstop liquidity lines, it said in a statement. This has triggered a "wind-down event," Mainsail II said, which means it could be forced to sell assets and close out hedge positions at a loss. The risk of using short-term borrowing to invest in longer-term assets has moved into sharp focus in recent weeks as borrowers around the world have found it more difficult and more costly to roll over maturing debt. In Canada, 17 issuers of asset-backed commercial paper sought cash last week due to market disruption, according to rating agency DBRS. Germany's IKB and Sachsen LB have both had to raise emergency credit facilities due to difficulties in funding off-balance sheet investment vehicles. A number of other funds that invest in asset-backed securities have suspended redemptions as they have been unable to value their investments due to illiquidity in the asset-backed market. "Liquidity has been drying up for some time, particularly in the important and risk-averse commercial paper market," analysts at CreditSights said in a note to clients. $4 BLN CP PROGRAMME Officials at Solent could not immediately be reached for comment. According to ratings agency Standard & Poor's, Mainsail has a commercial paper programme of up to $4 billion in place that is rated A-1+. It has also issued $407 million of mezzanine notes rated AAA and AA and $112 million of capital notes rated BBB-. The agency warned in its preliminary ratings on Mainsail in June 2006 that "there is a significant mismatch between the maturities of the assets (which mature in decades) and the liabilities (which mature in weeks or months)". Data from Moody's Investors Service show that as of March 31 all of Mainsail's assets were invested in triple-A or double-A rated securities, with 93.6 percent in U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities. Moody's did not rate the notes but had rated the commercial paper Prime 1. The agency said in a presale report published in July 2006 that this was Solent's first commercial-paper-funded structure and that it had a "high concentration" in subprime RMBS. Solent was founded in 2003, according to its Web site, by Tim Gledhill, formerly responsible for structured credit trading at Merrill Lynch; Jonathan Laredo, previously responsible for European and Asian structured finance at JP Morgan; and Geoff Smailes, formerly responsible for trading and capital allocation at Credit Suisse First Boston's fixed income emerging markets business.
