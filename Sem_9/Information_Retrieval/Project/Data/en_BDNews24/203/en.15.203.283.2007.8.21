 ZHUKOVSKY, Tue Aug 21, Russia (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin vowed to revive Russia's once mighty aviation industry on Tuesday as he opened an airshow aimed at showcasing the country's industrial and military ambitions. Putin, who watched as two dozen military jets, passenger planes and helicopters roared past him in acrobatic formation, last week ordered Russian strategic bombers to resume Soviet-era permanent air patrols over the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The move, which has irked the West, is part of Russia's growing assertiveness. The military, whose hardware is being built up as part of this policy, is in line for more and newer planes. "Russia...faces the task of maintaining supremacy in producing military aircraft," Putin said at the opening of the MAKS-2007 airshow at Zhukovsky airbase east of Moscow, where one of the strategic bombers was on display. The production of passenger planes is also growing. The government plans to replace hundreds of ageing Soviet-era passenger planes over the next 10 years with new Sukhoi and Tupolev jets meeting the latest standards. "The show presents the unique potential of our country," Putin said, addressing participants from all main Russian producers and delegates from 110 countries. This year's show, the biggest yet, involved around 800 participants and good attendance from Western planemakers such as Boeing and Airbus. Russia's planemaking industry, neglected after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, has become a focal point for Kremlin efforts to diversify the energy-dependent economy on the back of strong economic growth. As part of plans to revive the sector, Putin has ordered Russian aviation firms to merge into United Aviation Corporation (UAC) and pledged a total of 18 billion roubles ($696.6 million) of government investment in 2008-2010. Putin also said he wanted UAC to help boost exports of Russian-made passenger planes. "The main point of our exposition is the revival of Russia's aviation industry," UAC president and CEO Alexei Fyodorov told government daily Rossiiskaya Gazeta on Tuesday. Russia's military jets like the MIG-29 or Sukhoi-30 have been in demand abroad and formed a large part of the country's arms exports, worth more than $5 billion. Russian planemaker Sukhoi said at the show it had signed a contract to supply Indonesia with 6 Sukhoi fighters, worth $300 million, which will increase Jakarta's Russian-made fleet to 10 plan
