 MAPUTO, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Central banks' provision of short-term liquidity to markets was appropriate and while the credit crisis may have some impact, world economic prospects are good, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Rodrigo Rato said on Monday. "I think that the reponse of central banks to provide liquidity, short-term liquidity to the markets is an appropriate one to overcome the lack of liquidity among participants," Rato told reporters in the Mozambican capital Maputo. "As we understand, there will be some impact on growth but we still believe that prospects for the world economy are good," he said. The IMF had recently revised its global economic growth forecast upwards, he added. Global markets have been battered in the past month by fears of financial instability after trouble with risky US sub-prime mortgages and a credit squeeze. Central banks poured billions of dollars into the financial system to help ease fears and add liquidity while the US. Federal Reserve on Friday cut 50 basis points off the primary discount rate at which banks borrow from the Fed. Rato said the IMF is monitoring financial markets very closely. "We are monitoring now very closely the movements of the markets and also the implications of the credit crisis for the real economy". Rato is in Mozambique for a meeting of the African Consultative Group, a body formed in 2006 to facilitate consultation between African finance ministers and the IMF. Rato said the IMF had been stressing for months that transparency of the financial sector should be enhanced. "The financial sector is very dynamic and very creative and has been at the heart of world expansion in recent years but at the same time the appraisal of risk maybe have to be contemplated in a more realistic way," he said. The IMF head said market operators, participants, investors, consumers and the financial industry have to have a re-appraisal of risk while regulators in some markets also had to increase their understanding of different financial operations. "Right now, as far as the implications on growth and macro-economic stability of the crisis, we believe that both the central banks and the IMF should monitor the circumstances very closely," Rato said.
