<TITLE> Nokia replaces batteries in India: Report </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com) -- Battery fiasco may cost Nokia 8 crore rupees and the buyers' faith, said the Economic Times Tuesday. "At least 1.8 lakh Nokia customers in India are set to get replacements for BL-5C batteries in their mobile phones even as the Finnish giant's Indian unit has been bombarded with 30 lakh requests as on Monday," a company official told the newspaper. Though no incident of overheating (the cause for Nokia's offer of replacement) has been reported in India, the brand image could have taken a beating in this market, where it enjoys 70 percent share. "The market price of each BL-5C battery is Rs 720 and the cost at the company level is about half of it. When a shipment cost of Rs 50 is added, the total cost comes to about Rs 410 per battery replaced." Nokia is facing an expenditure of Rs 7-8 crore, though it is still unclear how much of the cost will be passed on to Japan's Matsushita, the manufacturer of the batteries. Further, the number is expected to go up as more users approach Nokia. The number of messages from worried customers to Nokia India has shot up from merely 4 lakh Friday. Of the 30 lakh requests, "5 percent to 6 percent are people whose batteries need to be replaced", Nokia India marketing director Devinder Kishore told ET. About 95,000 batteries bound for India have been shipped and replacements are yet to begin. "The batteries are in transit, but we would like to deliver new batteries within a minimum of 10 days after receiving a complaint," Kishore said. Some of the new batteries have also come from Nokia's manufacturing facility in Chennai, where the company makes handsets. Last week, Nokia announced a recall of 46 million batteries globally after discovering they could overheat and explode. These batteries were manufactured by Matsushita between October 2005 and November 2006. Nokia CEO Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo is set to visit India for three days beginning Wednesday. He is expected to make a statement on the issue, which has been hogging headlines for the past few days. "While Kishore said no incident of overheating had been reported from India, the company's image has definitely taken a beating. This is because despite Nokia's best efforts, customers are having difficulty finding out whether their batteries are defective and how long it will take to replace them," the Economic Times said. bdn
