 WASHINGTON, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A military judge on Monday dismissed two charges against a US Army intelligence officer charged with abuses at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison. Lt. Col. Steven Jordan headed the interrogation center at the prison and is the highest-ranking person charged in the abuse scandal which came to light after pictures showed US troops sexually humiliating detainees.

The charges stem from violations of the Uniformed Code of Military Justice alleged to have taken place at the Joint Interrogation Debriefing Center at Abu Ghraib on or about Sept. 17, 2003 to Aug. 19, 2004. A lawyer for Jordan could not immediately be reached for comment. An investigation of prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib carried out by Army Maj. Gen. Antonio Taguba in 2004 described Jordan as one of several directly or indirectly responsible.

Between May 2004 and September 2005, seven US troops were convicted of Abu Ghraib-related offenses, sentenced to prison and dishonorably discharged from service. Brig. Gen. Janis Karpinski, the commander of Abu Ghraib, was demoted to the rank of colonel in 2005. She denied knowledge of the abuses
