 BEIJING, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China has sent back a shipment of pacemakers imported from the United States because of quality problems, the country's standards watchdog reported on Monday, in the latest tit-for-tat measure over product safety. The General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine said the shipment of 272 pacemakers valued at about $250,000 that arrived in Shanghai in April did not meet standards. "The Inspection and Quarantine Department found on inspection that the pulse strength of the pacemaker device was not in line with its indicated properties," the administration said on its Web site (www.aqsiq.gov.cn). "As a result, they could create major hidden dangers in the lives of sick people," said the statement. On Monday, the quality inspection watchdog also announced it was creating an inspection database of imports and exports to help strengthen product safety. China has been struggling to convince the world its goods are safe after a series of scandals over the safety of products from toys to toothpaste. Officials say the world should have faith in the "made-in-China" label and charge that a spate of product recalls has been unfair, biased and politically motivated. Monday's announcement was the latest move by Beijing to turn the tables and charge that it also faces risks from unsafe imports, as it reels from a massive recall of Chinese-made toys manufactured for US toy giant Mattel. Central authorities had asked supervision and inspection deparments around the country to strengthen supervision of imports and "guarantee that the quality of imported products, especially those that touch upon human health and safety, meet standards". The inspection agency is developing a database to integrate inspection and quarantine information about imports and exports, the official Xinhua news agency reported. The data will help officials and businesses respond faster to developments, the report said.
