 REUTERS, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com)--- A majority of top US foreign policy experts say the world is a more dangerous place for Americans today than just six months ago, thanks largely to the war in Iraq and a failing US war on terrorism, a new survey shows. A majority of the 108 experts polled by Foreign Policy magazine and the Center for American Progress also said they would expect another Sept. 11-scale attack within the next decade, despite substantial improvements among US security, law enforcement and intelligence agencies. The findings appear as a Terrorism Index in the September/October issue of Foreign Policy magazine, which is published by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
