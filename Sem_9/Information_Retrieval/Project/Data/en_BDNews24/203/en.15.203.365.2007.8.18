<TITLE> S Korea's top party to pick presidential favourite </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SEOUL, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korea's leading party will choose between the country's most powerful women politician and a former business magnate in a primary on Sunday, where the winner is certain to emerge as the front-runner for the presidency. The results of the primary for the conservative Grand National Party will be known on Monday. The election for the president of the world's 12th largest economy is in December. Polls indicate Lee Myung-bak, a former top executive at the Hyundai Group who later was Seoul's mayor, is the favourite. But Park Geun-hye, the daughter of the iron ruler who pushed South Korea on the road to economic prowess in the 1960s and 70s, has almost closed the gap. About two out of three voters would pick either Lee or Park to be president, according to recent surveys, while the top left-leaning candidate is supported by only about one in every 20 voters. South Koreans want their next president to take a business-friendly approach to the economy and a harder line toward North Korea, surveys indicate. They have also grown weary of left-of-centre President Roh Moo-hyun, who is perceived as failing to stabilise an uncertain labour situation or cool down an overheated real estate market. Just ahead of the primary, prosecutors have launched an investigation into a possible shady land deal by Lee some 12 years ago. Lee denies any wrongdoing and many in his camp accuse the office of outgoing President Roh of using its influence to damage Lee's chances of election. Widely praised during his time as mayor for projects to add green spaces to the urban sprawl of the capital, the 65-year-old Lee's popularity rests heavily on his image as a person who can get things done. A pet theme is his promise of government backing for a $15 billion dollar project to build a waterway from Seoul to the main southern port of Busan. Park has a built-in support base due to her father, former President Park Chung-hee, who took power in a 1961 coup and created the conditions that turned South Korea into an economic powerhouse. He ruled until he was shot dead by his spy chief 18 years later and now is a polarising figure, seen by many Koreans as the country's best president while others revile him as a despot who tried to destroy democracy. Park, 55, who is trying to be the country's first woman president, acted as his first lady after her mother was killed by an assassin's bullet meant for her father.
