 BERNE, Switzerland, Aug 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazil remain top of FIFA's world rankings following a quiet month without any major international matches. The South Americans, who regained top spot in July thanks to their victory in the Copa America, stay one place in front of beaten finalists Argentina, while Italy hold onto third place. France and Germany complete an unchanged top five. Although none of the top ten teams were in action during the past month, there are some changes further down the list with sides losing points gained in previous years. Croatia climb one place to sixth at the expense of the Netherlands while Spain and the Czech Republic leapfrog 10th-placed Portugal. England remain in 12th place after slipping out of the top 10 last month. Iraq are the month's biggest climbers, jumping 16 places to 64th thanks to their unexpected triumph at last month's Asian Cup. Top 20 rankings 1. (1) Brazil 2. (2) Argentina 3. (3) Italy 4.
