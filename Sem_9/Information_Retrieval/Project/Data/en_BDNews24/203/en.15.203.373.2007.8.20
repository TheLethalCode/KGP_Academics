<TITLE> Oil slips as Dean seen sparing refiners </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil fell more than $1 on Monday after forecasts projected Hurricane Dean would skirt to the south of the US Gulf of Mexico that is home to half of US refining capacity and pumps a third of its oil. US crude was down $1.06 at $70.92 a barrel by 9:44 a.m. EDT, erasing Friday's rally when the US Federal Reserve cut its discount rate to restore order to financial markets and as Dean menaced. London Brent crude fell 68 cents to $69.76. The US National Hurricane Center forecast Dean would remain south of the U.S. portion of the Gulf and cross the Yucatan Peninsula en route to the east coast of Mexico. "Barring a sudden northerly veering of the track of the storm, Gulf of Mexico production should be materially unaffected," Citigroup analysts said in a research note. But Mexico's Bay of Campeche, home to 70 percent of Mexican oil output including the giant Cantarell field, was vulnerable to the storm, Citigroup noted. There are no significant refining operations in the area under threat, however. Hurricane Dean, a Category 4 storm packing winds of 145 miles per hour (230 km per hour), pounded Jamaica's southern coast on Sunday and could still strengthen into Category 5. U.S. operators shut around 23,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil output and 54 million cubic feet of natural gas. Mexico's state oil company Pemex said it had begun evacuating more than 13,000 workers from rigs. Mexico is among the top crude oil suppliers to US refiners, with Mexican exports to its neighbor averaging 1.469 million barrels per day (bpd) this year. Oil had rallied on Friday, recovering from its lowest close in a month and a half after the Federal Reserve's move to cut its discount lending rate by a half-percentage-point lifted stock markets battered by the credit market squeeze. European stock markets continued to rally on Monday. Last week's losses in financial markets had taken a toll on oil as investors sold to cover positions, knocking US crude prices nearly 10 percent down from its record high on August 1. "Should the Fed's action prove insufficient to calm market concerns, we believe that further liquidation could cause US WTI prices to drop to the mid-$60 a barrel level given the large remaining net speculative length in the energy market," Goldman Sachs wrote in a research note. It listed three factors that may trigger further liquidation: continued fund redemptions and the need to obtain liquidity; data suggesting a credit contagion to the real economy; data such as a US oil stock build. "Longer term, the continuing global credit turbulence raises significant risks for oil demand growth, but in the short term the biggest impacts on oil markets will likely be a flight to safety and a need to liquidate holdings to unwind leveraged positions elsewhere," PFC Energy said in a report.
