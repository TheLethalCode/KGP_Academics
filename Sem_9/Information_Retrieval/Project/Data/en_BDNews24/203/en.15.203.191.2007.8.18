 NEW DELHI, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian communists, who shore up the government, issued a fresh warning on Saturday against pursuing a historic nuclear energy deal with the United States. The left parties, whose 60 MPs ensure the survival of the government, were expected to boycott a panel formed to liaise between them and the ruling coalition or switch to offering only conditional support to protest against the deal. But the two sides had apparently bought time after communist leaders held talks with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the head of his ruling Congress party, Sonia Gandhi. "Given the widespread opposition to the agreement and the fact that a majority in parliament do not support the nuclear cooperation deal, the government should not proceed further with the agreement," the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI (M), said in a statement. "It is for the Congress leadership to decide on the matter which will have serious consequences for the government and the country," it said at the end of a two-day politburo meeting. There was no immediate comment from the government or Congress but leaders were likely to hold talks later on Saturday, party officials said. The deal aims to give India access to US nuclear fuel and equipment for the first time in three decades despite New Delhi having tested nuclear weapons and not having signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty. But critics, including India's Hindu nationalist opposition, say it will eventually hurt India's nuclear security because of U.S. laws on nuclear trade governing the pact. The communists say it would also impose American hegemony. India must negotiate an inspection regime for its civil nuclear facilities with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and win approval from the 45-nation Nuclear Suppliers Group before nuclear commerce can begin. The pact also needs the approval of U.S. Congress, where it is expected to face some dissent over proliferation fears. Prakash Karat, general-secretary of the CPI (M) -- the largest of the four left parties in parliament -- said he had urged the government and the ruling party not to pursue steps such as negotiating the IAEA safeguards. "We realise that the bilateral agreement is done," Karat told a news conference referring to the India-US pact finalised last month. "There are two or three other steps they have to take to operationalise it. We are saying don't operationalise it."
