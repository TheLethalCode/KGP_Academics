<TEXT>
 BUDAPEST, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jewish leaders in Europe and the United States have called on Hungary to prevent a far-right party from forming a body whose uniforms will, they say, ape those worn in the World War Two fascist era. The World Jewish Congress has asked Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany to act against the Jobbik party's plan to form a "Hungarian Guard" with black uniforms and red-and-white flashes associated with Nazism. "... We respectfully call upon you to do your urgent utmost to see to it that any political party which manifests expressions of hatred or bigotry ... is stopped," the WJC said in an open letter to Gyurcsany published on Tuesday. Jewish groups in Hungary have complained of rising anti-Semitism and the use of symbols like a red-and-white striped flag during anti-government demonstrations last year. The flag is similar to one used by the wartime Arrow Cross regime, which murdered thousands of Jews and deported hundreds of thousands to Nazi death camps. Those who support its use say it is a merely a medieval Hungarian flag. Jobbik, which denies it is anti-Jewish, has said its 56 founding members will take an oath in uniform at Budapest castle on Saturday to defend Hungary, and that hundreds may join them. It denies the uniforms are associated with the Nazi era. "What is true is that black will be the dominant colour. Black is a colour of celebration ... a dignified colour," Jobbik leader Gabor Vona told the right of centre Magyar Nemzet paper at the weekend. Hungary's Socialist and Free Democrat coalition government has condemned the guard but not banned it. The main right of centre opposition Fidesz party has not condemned it. Lawyers say that while marching around in black shirts is not illegal in Hungary, there is a risk in any post-communist state in eastern Europe that the situation could get out of control. "What makes it special is that in Hungary and other central European countries, democratic institutions are not strong enough to deal with this sort of challenge," said Zoltan Fleck, professor of the sociology of law at Budapest's ELTE university.
