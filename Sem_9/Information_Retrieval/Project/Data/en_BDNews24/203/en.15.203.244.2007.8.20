 TEHRAN, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran expects the UN nuclear watchdog to highlight Tehran's cooperation over its atomic plans in a report next month that could determine whether it faces fresh UN sanctions, an Iranian official said on Monday. Senior officials from Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency meet for a third round of talks later on Monday to discuss Tehran's offer of greater transparency, part of the country's bid to ward off a third UN sanctions resolution. Iran, under UN pressure to suspend work the West suspects is aimed at assembling atom bombs, agreed in June to draft an "action plan" within 60 days to give the IAEA more access to atomic sites and defuse suspicions about its aims. Two earlier rounds of negotiations were held in July and August. Mohammad Saeedi, deputy of head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation, on Monday described those talks as "very good and constructive" but said discussions still had a long way to run. "Our expectation from Mohammad Elbaradei, the agency's director, is that he would point to this cooperation in his report," Saeedi told the official IRNA news agency. ElBaradei has said Iran's pledge to work out an action plan has raised hope of resolving the row between Iran and the West. An IAEA report is due out by September, and world powers have put off efforts to toughen sanctions at least until then. Iran insists its atomic work is solely civilian. The IAEA team in Tehran, led by deputy director in charge of nuclear safeguards Olli Heinonen, will hold talks with a team led by Iran's deputy nuclear negotiator, Javad Vaeedi. An Iranian official told Reuters the first meeting would start on Monday afternoon, with more talks scheduled for Tuesday. This round of discussions will tackle some of the trickiest issues such as the origin of traces of highly enriched -- or bomb-grade -- uranium found on some equipment and the status of research into advance centrifuges used in enrichment. Enrichment, the part of Iran's programme that most worries the West, is a process for making fuel for nuclear power plants but, if Iran wished, it could be used to make bomb material. After Heinonen's talks in July, Iran reopened the Arak heavy-water reactor it is building for inspection after barring access in April in protest over the second batch of sanctions
