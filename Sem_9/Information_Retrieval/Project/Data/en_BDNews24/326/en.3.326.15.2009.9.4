 URUMQI, China, Sep 4,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tension flared in China's western city of Urumqi on Friday, when hundreds of Han Chinese tried to push past security barriers into an ethnic Uighur neighbourhood and shouted demands for better security. The confrontation came a day after many thousands of Han Chinese massed in the streets in Urumqi, regional capital of Xinjiang, protesting that they were the targets of mysterious attacks with syringes and that authorities had been too slow to punish Uighurs behind deadly riots on July 5. China announced arrests and indictments over the July 5 violence between Han Chinese and Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking Muslim people native to the area, as officials sought to prevent fresh protests by Han Chinese. But the flare-up showed the city remains volatile despite a security crackdown across the energy-rich region. "They have no right to block off the road like this. These Uighurs have been stabbing us with needles," said one man trying to push through barriers sealing off a Uighur neighbourhood. "We need to take care of the problem." Thousands of Han Chinese protested in Urumqi on Thursday. Some demanded the resignation of the region's veteran Communist Party Secretary after a wave of reports of attacks with syringes. Later, troops carrying riot shields and rifles guarded city streets after authorities imposed a night-time curfew in response to the noisy 3,000-strong gathering in People's Square. But the tight security failed to deter some protesters. After the confrontation at the barrier, a group of about 50 young men who appeared to be Han Chinese, unfurled a Chinese flag and marched around shouting demands for "safety", followed by several hundred people. Police snatched away the flag, but the crowd continued shouting. "The main thing is nobody here feels secure any more," said onlooker Zhen Guibin. Many people complained that those behind the killings on July 5 had not been tried. A protest by Uighurs that day gave way to a spree of violence across the city in which 197 people were killed, most of them Han Chinese. Two days later, Uighur neighbourhoods in the city were attacked by Han Chinese demanding revenge. "TERRORIST CRIME" Li Zhi, Urumqi's Communist Party boss, raised the political stakes on Thursday by saying the syringe stabbings were part of a plot by separatist forces to sow conflict, the official Xinhua news agency said. "This was a grave terrorist crime," Li said in a speech. "The goal was to create ethnic division and stir up ethnic antagonism in a bid to overturn social order, split the motherland and split the Chinese nation." China says Uighurs campaigning for independence are allied with Islamist militants in the region, and there have been occasional deadly bomb attacks on government targets in Xinjiang. Xinjiang's population is divided mainly between Uighurs, who were long the region's majority group, and Han Chinese, many of whom moved there in recent decades. Most Urumqi residents are Han. The Xinjiang government, apparently trying to staunch anger, announced on Thursday that 196 suspects have been charged over the July riot. Fifty-one were indicted and will face prosecution. The announcement was reported by Xinhua news agency late on Thursday, and the government sent a similar message via text messages to Urumqi residents from Wednesday evening, after a small protest that day over the syringe attack reports. Some Han Chinese residents were unimpressed. "I think the government has been way too lax towards the Uighurs," said a Han shop owner who identified himself as Zhang. "This policy has got to change. We shouldn't have all these minorities, we should only have one Chinese ethnicity." But Uighur residents said they were the victims of panic. "There have been many Uighurs beaten up," said Arwa Quli, a Uighur woman on her way to work. "If you just brush against someone, they might think that you tried to stab them." The turmoil also brought rare public demands for Wang Lequan, the region's Communist Party chief for 14 years, to leave office. Government text messages in recent days warning of attackers armed with hypodermic needles may have stoked the alarm. The Xinjiang health office has said that over the past two weeks 476 people have gone to hospital to report apparent syringe stabbings -- 433 of them Han Chinese. Regional television said doctors had "found clear syringe marks in 89 cases". But rumours of AIDS patients attacking people with hypodermic needles have previously rattled parts of China, but were later shown to be unfoun
