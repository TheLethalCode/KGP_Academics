 Dhaka, Sept 4 (bdnews24.com)--Health minister A F M Ruhal Haq visited the National Committee on Protection of Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources and Power and Ports member secretary professor Anu Muhammad who was injured in Wednesday's police atrocities during a demonstration. The minister inquired after the health of prof Muhammad, who also teaches at Jahangirnagar University, and expressed his sympathies at Square Hospital. Former police chief M A Mabud was with him. Haq later saw Azad Group chief Abul Kalam Azad, released on bail in a case regarding attempted murder of a police officer, at the hospital Around 50 people were injured when police charged around 500 demonstrators of the national committee with baton at Paltan as they were marching towards Petrobangla head office at Karwan Bazar. The protesters had been demanding cancellation of recent offshore oil and gas exploration deals in the Bay of Bengal with two international companies.. The government on Thursday said the police assault was 'unexpected and sad'. The home ministry said in a statement said authorities will take legal action against the law-enforcers if any excesses were committed by any member linked to the clash. Convenor of the committee Sheikh Shahidullah said another procession would be organised on Sept 10 to the prime minister's office after a programme at Muktangan if the government failed to cancel the offshore deals. He also warned of a wider programme, including strikes and further sieges if the government did not fulfil the demands. On Aug 24, the government approved offshore oil and gas exploration deals with ConocoPhillips and Tullow Oil plc in three sea blocks in the resource-rich Bay.
