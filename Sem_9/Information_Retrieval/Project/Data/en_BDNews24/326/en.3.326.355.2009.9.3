 Dhaka, Sep 3 (bdnews24.com)Stocks closed the week with a slight rise on perked-up market participation which observers said was an outcome of market correction. "The market has lost steam over the last couple of weeks; it seems the market is going through correction," said Bashir Ahmed, investment consultant for brokerage firm Stocks & Bonds. Brokerage house officials said Thursday's trading was marked with both increased buying and selling. "After a long interval, we had to deal with a lot of buying and selling orders today," said an official of Akij Securities, who would not be named. Of the traded issues, 117 advanced, 116 declined and five remain unchanged. Dhaka Stock Exchange started the day upbeat, but fell on profit-taking around midday. It, however, remained steady for the last one and half hours of the session. The benchmark general index or the DGEN rose just over 10 points to end on 2985.46 while turnover increased to Tk 5.26 billion from Wednesday's Tk 4.46 billion. The all share index or DSI ended on 2500.53 points, up 20.27 points or 0.81 percent, while the blue chip DSE-20 closed 14.97 points up, or 0.71 percent, to close on 2120.28. The banks, market driver, performed well after seeing depressing trend over the last couple of weeks while non-banking financial institutions (NBFIs) continued to gain. Mutual funds shed after Wednesday's highs while most of the insurers followed with pharmaceutical majors rising. Most of the scrips in power and energy also fell, although the day turned out to be a good one for IT shares. Beximco Pharma topped the turnover board, with shares of Tk 589.630 million traded, although it gained only 1.82 percent to Tk 167.40. Beximco slipped 0.93 percent to Tk 284.40, with shares worth Tk 200.548 million changing hands following Wednesday's gains.

Premier Bank, which had a turnover of Tk 169.603 million, saw its price closing 4.99 percent higher at Tk 268.25 on reports of the bank's decision to purchase some real estates. Among the other scrips on the boardLanka Bangla Finance and Summit Power also ended higher. Selling pressure caused ICB 2nd NRB Mutual Fund and AIMS 1st Mutual Fund to erode the previous day's gains. Indices on the Chittagong Stock Exchange also ended upbeat, driven by banks, NBFIs and pharmaceutical shares. The benchmark selective categories index closed 31.39 points, or 0.47 percent higher, at 6700.23, while the all share price index or CASPI ended on 10482.25, up by 45.75 points or 0.43 percent.
