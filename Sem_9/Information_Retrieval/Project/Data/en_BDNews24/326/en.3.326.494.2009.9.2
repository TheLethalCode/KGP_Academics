<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 1 (bdnews24.com)The government formed a committee to investigate circumstances surrounding the arrest of Azad Group chairman Abul Kalam Azad, for reportedly assaulting a CID officer last week, after an FBCCI delegation approached the home minister on Tuesday. The two-member committee will be headed by additional secretary to the home ministry Md Iqbal Khan Chowdhury. The committee has been given 15 days to submit a report. Police arrested Azad on Aug 27, following a case filed by CID officer, Golam Sarwar, who accused him of attempted murder. Azad secured bail in the case on Monday, but was jailed the same day in connection with a forgery case filed by the investigating officer in the first case. Azad's son Ziaur Rahman Azad in a press conference on Aug 29 claimed that his father had been tortured in police custody after his arrest in a "false case". The country's apex trade body FBCCI has also protested Azad's arrest and "remand in police custody on charges of assaulting a police officer". Business leaders, led by FBCCI president Anisul Huq, met the home and commerce ministers Tuesday, asking for a probe. The government formed its probe committee a few hours after the meetings. An FBCCI press release said the delegation requested the ministers to treat the issue with sympathy as Azad was designated a CIP (Commercially Important Person). Businessmen also expressed concern over the cases filed against Azad, his arrest and remand, and demanded a fair inquiry into the whole affair. CID officer, Golam Sarwar, who reportedly went to the Grand Azad Hotel owned by Azad last Thursday to see the latter about a job for a relative. Sarwar alleged Azad, being furious at being approached without an appointment, had assaulted him along with several hotel employees putting his life at risk. Azad was arrested in the early hours of Friday. The investigation officer in the attempted murder case Mazharul Amin filed a forgery case on Sunday morning. Amin's case statement said two seals, used by government offices, and a design of a high-rise building, were recovered from Azad. The statement alleged the accused had kept these seals in his office with a motive to forge documents. Azad was produced before the Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Court on Monday, granted bail in the first case and sent to jail in the second. bdnew
