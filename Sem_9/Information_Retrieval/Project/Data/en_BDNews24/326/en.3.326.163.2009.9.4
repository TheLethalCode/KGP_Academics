<TITLE> New law will curb irregularities at private universities: Nahid </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 4 (bdnews24.com)The new law on private universities has been designed with strict provisions to deal with the irregularities, according to the education minister. Nurul Islam Nahid told bdnews24.com on Friday that the universities, leaving one or two, disregard law in running affairs. "But we're going to enact the amended Private University Act 2009 soon with strict measures to supervise their activities," the minister added. Asked why had the president, the chancellor, not attended the convocation of Asian University Bangladesh, Nahid said, "The president and I did not join the ceremony because they do not have the approval to open campuses outside Dhaka and run distant learning education." The convocation ceremony at the private university on July 27 was abandoned as students refused to accept diplomas from none other than the president, Zillur Rahman. The students of its Dhaka campus refused to join classes after the incident, while protests have been swelling on campuses outside Dhaka over recognition of its certificates, environment and removal of the vice chancellor. "I have heard that many private institutions are operating without government approval, certifying certain courses... the students will have to face trouble in the future. "They do not provide quality education, proper accommodation to ensure a sound environment for studies, and are violating the law, the minister observed. "They are taking chances." "Those at fault still can ensure proper environment by providing necessary facilities. "The authorities will be given opportunity to address the lacking and continue operations for the students' sake," Nahid added. University Grants Commission chairman Professor Nazrul Islam told bdnews24.com on Sunday the draft law, aiming to raise education standards in the private sector that has long been accused of irregularities, is set to be tabled in the upcoming parliament session. "We have submitted a draft of the law to the ministry and expect it to be placed in the next parliament session scheduled to sit from Sept 7." Though the caretaker government passed the Private University Ordinance 2008 on Nov 24 last year, it became ineffective for not being enacted in time by the ninth parliament. An education ministry official told bdnews24.com that the proposed law would be sent to the cabinet for approval and subsequently placed in the parliament as a bill. There are 51 private universities in Bangladesh, many of which are charged, most commonly, with setting up without proper facilities and providing sub-standard education.
