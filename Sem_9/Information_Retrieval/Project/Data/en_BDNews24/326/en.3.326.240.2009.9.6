<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 6 (bdnews24.com)Parliament goes into the third session on Monday, with main opposition BNP looking likely to maintain their long absence. Opposition chief whip Jainal Abdin Farrouque said since they were observing a three-day mourning programme, that began Sunday, following the death of veteran BNP leader M Saifur Rahman, they would not join the House on the first day of the session. He said they would hold a meeting with opposition MPs and make a decision after the mourning programme that ends on Tuesday. The ruling coalition headed by the Awami League has taken no move to bring the opposition back to the House. Reconvening at 11am, the House is likely to dispose of the day's business before the Asr prayers, parliament secretariat sources say. "This will be a short session," speaker Abdul Hamid told bdews24.com on Saturday. The sources say the parliament secretariat has proposed that the session be run for nine working days until Sept 17. But the duration of the session will be fixed at the meeting of the Business Advisory Committee, headed by the speaker, on Monday morning. Chief whip Abdus Shahid said to bdnews24.com on Sunday morning when asked if the treasury was making an effort to bring the BNP back: "What initiative should we take to bring them back to the House?" He said the BNP should come to parliament first and then raise their demands. "People have voted them to come to parliament. Their boycott is really unfortunate," he said. The BNP started staying off parliament from Jan 28, the second day of the first session, over a seating arrangement dispute with the ruling coalition. The ruling coalition reduced the BNP's frontline seats to four from eight. Outgoing speaker Jamiruddin Sircar, now a BNP MP elected from a seat vacated by opposition chief Khaleda Zia, gave the main opposition nine seats without the consent of the Awami League. The BNP MPs returned to the House on Feb 23 as Speaker Abdul Hamid assured them of allocating 'respectable' number of seats on the front row in the second session. Hamid agreed to give the BNP one more seat in the front row while it demanded three. The BNP stayed away from the second and budget session over the dispute. Parliament secretariat sources say the government will table a fresh billReal Estate Development and Management Bill, 2009in the upcoming session. Eight more bills also await passage. The bills are: Artharin Adalalt (Amendment) Bill-2009, Local Government (City Corporation) Bill-2009, Local Government (Pourashabha) Bill-2009, Pesticides (Amendment) Bill-2009, Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Authority (Amendment) Bill-2009, Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (Amendment) Bill-2009, Insurance Regulatory Authority Bill-2009 and Insurance Bill-2009. bd
