<TITLE> Japan's Hatoyama to meet US envoy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Sep 3, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's next leader Yukio Hatoyama was to meet the US ambassador on Thursday as concerns simmered about the allies' ties after an election win by Hatoyama's party, which has pledged a more independent diplomatic course. Hatoyama, whose Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) crushed the long-ruling Liberal Democrats in Sunday's election, sought to reassure US President Barack Obama in a phone call early on Thursday that the relationship would stay central to Tokyo's diplomacy. "I told him we think the US-Japan alliance is the foundation (of Japanese diplomacy) and I would like to build US-Japan relations with eyes on the future," Hatoyama told reporters after his conversation with Obama. The prospect of a Democratic Party administration in Japan, ruled for most of the past half-century by a conservative party that put the US partnership at the core of its security stance, has raised worries in Washington about a tilt away from the alliance. Most analysts say no huge shift is in store once Hatoyama takes up the premiership on September 16 but investors are also concerned about a possible rocky road ahead. The Democrats pledged in their campaign platform to create a more equal partnership with Washington while forging warmer ties with Asian neighbors such as China. The U.S.-educated Hatoyama also raised eyebrows in Washington with a recent essay, published in English, in which he attacked the "unrestrained market fundamentalism" of U.S.-led globalization. He has since sought to play down those comments. "It was an error of judgment on the part of Hatoyama and the DPJ to have the essay published in English," said Koichi Nakano, a professor at Tokyo's Sophia University. "It was for domestic consumption and had its purpose in the campaign context, but putting it out in English for an American audience was unwise." U.S. officials, however, have raised eyebrows themselves in Tokyo by forcefully reiterating Washington's position that deals on U.S. forces in Japan were not up for renegotiation. RISKING BACKLASH? The Democrats have said they want to reexamine an agreement governing U.S. military forces in Japan and a deal on rejigging U.S. troops under which about 8,000 Marines would leave for the U.S. territory of Guam and a Marine air base be shifted to a less populated part of the southern island of Okinawa. "Just to make it abundantly clear, both the United States and Japan, at the government-to-government level, have made it absolutely clear that these agreements have been signed, agreed to, and are going forward," new U.S. ambassador John Roos said in an interview with U.S. National Public Radio on Wednesday. Roos was scheduled to meet Hatoyama later on Thursday. Few analysts expected a Democratic Party government to make big changes in the alliance, given decades of close ties and Japan's reliance on the US nuclear umbrella to protect it from such regional threats as unpredictable neighbor North Korea. But Washington would do well to avoid a strident tone in talks with Japan's government-in-waiting, some analysts said. "Japan is so heavily reliant on the United States that radical change is not going to happen," Sophia University's Nakano said. "But American senior officials taking such a haughty stance after the Japanese people have spoken in favor of a change of government is not diplomatically very sound. "They have to be careful. They don't want a backlash." Such concerns may have been reflected in comments in Washington by the top U.S. diplomat for Asia, Kurt Campbell, who said Washington saw no contradiction between a call for more independence from Washington and a healthy alliance. "For the alliance to maintain its relevance and its influence ... a degree of independence, of confidence, is absolutely essential on the part of Japan," Campbell, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, told a think tank in Washington.
