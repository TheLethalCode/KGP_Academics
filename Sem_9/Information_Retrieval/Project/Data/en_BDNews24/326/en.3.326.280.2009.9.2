 JAMRUD, Pakistan Sep 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan troops killed 40 militants on Tuesday in a new offensive in the rugged Khyber region, a crucial thoroughfare for US military supplies heading for Afghanistan, officials said. They also said up to 45 militants had been killed in the past five days on a second front in the Swat Valley, scene of a massive offensive since April that resulted in hundreds of thousands of civilians being displaced. The show of force in Swat and elsewhere has helped allay fears among allies -- particularly the United States and others with troops in neighbouring Afghanistan -- that nuclear-armed Pakistan was failing to confront Islamist militancy. The Khyber's top government officer told a news conference in Peshawar, capital of neighbouring North West Frontier Province, that troops fired artillery at militants. Residents said helicopter gunships flew several sorties but did not open fire. "Forty militants were killed and 43 arrested during the operation," Peshawar official Tariq Hayat Khan said. "It will continue till we achieve our objective and restore writ of government." The Khyber is one of seven Pakistan regions with a high degree of autonomy based on tribal law. On Aug. 27 a suicide bomber killed 22 border guards at the main crossing to Afghanistan and there have also been attacks on military supply convoys. In Swat, troops killed 15 militants during an operation that began late on Monday, said military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Akhtar Abbas. The military puts the toll of militants it has killed since the latest fighting there began on Friday at 45. Another 104 insurgents surrendered in Kanju, once a militant stronghold in the restive Swat valley, the military said in a statement. The army went on the offensive in Swat in late April and says it has killed more than 2,000 militants and lost 312 soldiers in the fighting. Independent casualty estimates are unavailable. Despite the Taliban's losses, the recent clashes and a suicide attack on Sunday that killed 12 police recruits in Swat's main town of Mingora showed they can still hit back. The Aug. 27 suicide attack in Khyber was the first since Pakistani Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud was killed in a U.S. missile strike in early August. Hakimullah Mehsud, who led militants in the Khyber, Orakzai and Kurram tribal regions, has been chosen as the new overall commander of the Pakistani Tali
