 Dhaka, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com)--Main opposition BNP has asked the government to withdraw all cases against Tarique Rahman and put no hurdles to his return home. "Tarique Rahman should be allowed permanent release by withdrawing all cases against him," secretary general Delwar Hossain said in Naya Paltan on Thursday, marking one year of the release of former senior joint secretary general and BNP chief Khaleda Zia's elder son from jail. Delwar demanded withdrawal, also, of all cases filed against Khaleda and other leaders. He accused the government of double standards in its treatment of cancelling cases filed for political persecution. "They (the government) are violating law by withdrawing only the cases filed against their people. "If the government is democratic and respectful to law, it will withdraw all cases against all political parties," he said. The public prosecutor at Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court recommended cancellation of a case against Tarique on Wednesday. Businessman Abu Shahed Shahel had filed Tk 4.89 crore extortion case against controversial businessman Gias Uddin Al Mamun with Gulshan Police Station on May 4, 2007. Eleven cases were filed against him and 24 more cases against the family of Khaleda. Another BNP leader, Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, said the government should take action against those who tortured Tarique. "Otherwise, the politicians will have to face the same fate in the future." He claimed that Tarique was still senior joint secretary general and added that he would resume working for the party after return. Tarique, who was arrested on Mar 8, 2007, was released on Sept 3 after securing bail in 12 cases. He is in London for medical treatment. Tarique formally quit the political scene, leaving a note at the airport, resigning from his post as BNP senior joint secretary general, before boarding a London-bound flight on Sept 11 to apparently live in exile. Earlier in the day, Delwar told reporters at former president Ziaur Rahman's grave in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar that Tarique would return home soon after his recovery. Khaleda and senior leaders laid flowers at the grave and offered prayers at around 11:30am. b
