 Fri Sep 4, 2009 8:30am BST CHENNAI, India, Sep 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A leading French chess player turned up drunk and dozed off after just 11 moves in an international tournament in Kolkata, losing the round on technical grounds, domestic media reported Friday. Grandmaster Vladislav Tkachiev arrived for Thursday's match against India's Praveen Kumar in such an inebriated state that he could hardly sit in his chair and soon fell asleep, resting his head on the table, Hindustan Times newspaper reported. Indian papers carried pictures of the world number 58 sleeping and the organisers' futile attempts to wake his up. The game was awarded to the Indian on the technical ground of Tkachiev being unable to complete his moves within the stipulated time of an hour and 30 minutes, the paper said. The player was warned and reprimanded by the organisers afterwards but has been allowed to take part in the remainder of the competition, the paper said.
