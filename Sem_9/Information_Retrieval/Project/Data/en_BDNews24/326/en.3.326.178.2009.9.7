 Dhaka, Sept 07 (bdnews24.com)A Jatiya Party MP has proposed farming Hilsha fish in ponds. "Hilsha fish has become dearer in market. My proposal is whether we can cultivate Hilsha fish in ponds," Hafiz Uddin Ahmmad, a Thakurgaon MP, asked fisheries and livestock minister Abdul Latif Biswas during parliament's question and answer session on Monday. The fisheries minister said he would look into the matter. Hilsha, the national fish of Bangladesh, are traditionally caught when they make their way into the sweet water river system from the Bay of Bengal to release their eggs during the rainy season. bdnews24.com/krc/sum/sm/am/1725
