<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 1 (bdnews24.com)Sugar mill-owners in the country have agreed to sell sugar directly to Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB) dealers in Dhaka at a fixed price to keep the cost of the essential item a tolerable level over Ramadan. The agreement was struck at a meeting between commerce minister Faruq Khan and representatives of sugar mill owners at the Secretariat on Tuesday. Under the arrangement, TCB dealers in Dhaka will be permitted to procure up to five tonnes of sugar a day from the mills over Ramadan at the fixed price of Tk 39 a kilogram. "The move should have a positive impact on the market, providing TCB dealers can buy sugar at Tk 39 a kilogram and sell at a maximum price of Tk 42," Firoz Ahmed, a secretary at the commerce ministry, told bdnews24.com after the meeting. He said refiners had been selling sugar at Tk 39 a kilogram, but regular wholesalers had been realising up to Tk 46 a kilogram, while retailers were charging shoppers up to Tk 48 a kilogram in the capital's markets. According to TCB, the price of sugar rose by 13.10 percent over the last month, with the lone state-run trading company's website on Monday reporting the essential retailing at Tk 47-48 a kilogram. Shoppers on Tuesday, however, said the price of sugar in the market was as high as Tk 52 a kilogram. In a bid to stabilise the price of sugar, the government recently suspended its import duty on unrefined sugar and reduced its duty on refined sugar from Tk 7000 to Tk 3000 a tonne.
