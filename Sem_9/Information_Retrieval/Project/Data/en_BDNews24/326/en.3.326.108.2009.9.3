<TITLE> ICC seeks to explore cricket-specific WADA code </TITLE>

 CHENNAI, India, Sep 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The International Cricket Council will ask the World Anti-Doping Agency to consider a cricket-specific code for its controversial "whereabouts" rule, ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat told Indian media Thursday. The influential Indian cricket board rejected the WADA directive last month, backing its players' refusal to sign up over security and privacy issues. The ICC became a WADA signatory in 2006 and world cricket's governing body last year unanimously approved out-of-competition tests on players in accordance with amendments made to the code. The issue is yet to be resolved and will be discussed by the ICC board in October. "We will ask them (WADA) for a cricket-specific code or a relaxation of the whereabouts clause," Lorgat told DNA newspaper. "For the time being, we have referred the issue to our executive board. We will take the matter from there. The issues need discussion with a broader range of people. The code cannot be country-specific."
