 Barguna, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com)Twenty-four hours of incessant rain, caused by a low in the Bay of Bengal, has left hundreds of thousands marooned as some 65 villages in Khulna and Barguna districts inundated, WDB officials said on Saturday, blaming delayed or poor repairs to damaged flood barriers after Cyclone Aila hit the southwest region in May. Flash floods damaging a flood embankment submerged some 20 villages, affecting over 100,000 people, in Dakope upazila of Khulna, officials said. Water Development Board divisional engineer Abdur Hawladar told bdnews24.com, the villages were inundated as cracks developed in seven to eight spots in the embankment of the rivers Shibsasdaki and Vadra on Saturday evening. Hawladar said daylong rainfall along with a tidal surge of four to five feet caused the embankments to breach at different points. The submerged villages include Sutarkhali, South Kalabhogi, Nolian, East Nolian, Gunari, Katabunia,Golbunia, Madyam Bunia, Sutarkhali Majpara, Kamarkhola, North Kamarkhola, Joynagar, Sreenagar, Kalinagar, among others. Sutarkhali Union Parishad chairman Bidhu Narayan Sarkar said over one lakh people were stranded and suffering great difficulties. Most of the victims took shelter in different shelter centres and educational institutions, he said. PDB deputy engineer Anwar Hossain told bdnews24.com, the damage occurred as dams and embankments hit by Aila in May were not repaired properly. In Barguna, at least 45 villages were flooded when water levels of the rain swollen Paira and Bishkhali rivers passed their danger marks, Abdul Majid Mollah, executive engineer of Barguna Water Development Board, told bdnews24.com. Mollah said the local WDB recorded 63 centimetres of rainfall in the 24 hours up to Saturday afternoon. Many houses located outside the flood protection embankments in the area were inundated with two-to-four feet of water, while some villages inside the barriers were also affected due to damaged flood defences, said Mollah. Mollah said some flood protection embankments in the district had been weakened by Cyclone Aila in May this year. Seven villages in Barguna Sadar upazila were inundated, five in Betagia, 11 in Patharghata, seven in Bamna and 15 in Amtali upazilas, he said. "The water have receded to some extent as a result of the natural ebb of the rivers," said the WDB official. Gazi Mahmud, a resident of Barguna Sadar upazila, told bdnews24.com he knew of over 200 families that had sought shelter on the embankment's higher ground. Meanwhile, Golam Mostofa Chowdhury, president of Barguna District Trawler Owners Association, said over 500 trawlers made it back to shore Saturday afternoon when waters in the Bay became turbulent. bdnew
