 Dhaka, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com)The National Education Formulation Policy Committee submitted the long-awaited education plan to the education ministry on Wednesday. Committee chairman national professor Kabir Chowdhury and co-chairman Dr Quazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmed handed the National Education Policy 2009, with a recommendation to extend primary education up to eight years, to minister Nurul Islam Nahid. The policy also recommended extending secondary level to Class 12, as well as uniform curricula across different school systems, modernising madrasa studies and forming a permanent education commission. The National Education Formulation Policy Committee was formed on Apr 8 with 17 members. The committee, once formed, was supposed to submit the report within 90 working days but the deadline was later extended by a month. The policy document is furnished with separate chapters on primary, secondary and higher education, technical education as well as madrasa education. The new guidelines recommend phased extension of primary level education, which is compulsory, up to Class 8, Kholiquzzaman said on Tuesday. He said primary level would be extended to Class 6 by 2012, Class 7 by 2015 and up to Class 8 by 2018. Identical curriculum and syllabus have been recommended for all existing primary education systems, Kholiquzzaman said. Some fundamental subjects will be compulsory including Bangla, moral education, Bangladesh studies, mathematics, natural environment, social studies, IT and science. Final primary level exams will be held at the end of Class 8 and secondary school scholarships will be awarded based on the results. The new policy also recommends that secondary level studies would extend over four academic years, Classes 9-12, and the government scholarship exams would be taken at the end of Class 10 in lieu of SSC exams. Final secondary level exams would be held at the end of the Class 12. The new education plan also stresses modernisation of madras education by including information technology and vocational training among compulsory subjects. "It places importance on technical and vocational education to produce a skilled workforce," Kholiquzzaman said. The policy calls for some form of vocational education to be introduced at all secondary level institutions, including madrasas. It also recommends increasing the number of polytechnic, textile and leather institutes in order to expand technical education. The policy also suggests unifying the syllabus for degree-level subjects across all universities. It also recommends decentralisation of National University, with centres in all divisions as a part of the decentralisation process to run its activities smoothly. The guidelines in its latter part recommend formation of a permanent education commission to implement policy, Kholiquzzaman said. The report also says that the commission will help the education ministry and University Grants Commission in implementing the national education policy. It will present annual reports on the implementation and development of the policy with timely recommendations bdne
