 SYDNEY, Sep 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia wicketkeeper Brad Haddin has been ruled out of cricket's Champions Trophy in South Africa this month while he recovers from finger surgery. Haddin, who broke his finger during the recent Ashes Test series in England, had hoped to join his team mates in South Africa after returning home for the operation but has been told to wait. "While the surgery was a success and there have been no complications, the timeframe for recovery is not sufficient and therefore he cannot be considered for selection," Australia's team doctor Trefor James said in a statement Thursday. Haddin said he hoped to be available for Australia's tour of India this year while team officials have asked the International Cricket Council to allow Tim Paine to replace Haddin in the Champions Trophy squad.
