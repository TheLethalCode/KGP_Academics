 Dhaka, Sep 3 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina, in Geneva, has called for climate adaptation funds, affordable and eco-friendly technology transfer to developing countries with commitments for deeper cuts in greenhouse gas emissions by rich nations. Hasina, addressing the WMO's World Climate Conference 3 in the Swiss city on Thursday, said the challenge to countries like Bangladesh of facing natural disasters from global warming and climate change is "monumental" She backed the World Meteorological Organization's proposal for a new World Climate Services System, but stressed the system would only work with international support and funding for climate change adaptations. "Bangladesh is among the countries severely affected climate change, and estimates indicate that 20 million Bangladeshis would require relocation by 2050," Hasina said. "A metre rise of sea level would inundate one third of Bangladesh. This would result in mass migration northwards, imposing increasing pressure on land and resources, and loss of livelihood of about 40 million people." "The International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR) ranked Bangladesh, as the most vulnerable country to floods, third most to tsunami, and sixth most to cyclones, in terms of human exposure." She said Bangladesh is already experiencing erratic patterns of flooding and droughts, which has also become a threat to ensuring food security through sustained agricultural production. Bangladesh itself is already invested in a Climate Adaptation Strategy Plan, one of the first such plans of any country, and established a Climate Change Fund. Hasina also said the country, long-facing natural disasters due to its geographical location, had spent over $10 billion since its independence on flood management schemes, coastal polders, cyclone and flood shelters, and elevation of roads and highways above flood level. Bangladesh had also developed crop varieties attuned to climate change, initiated programmes to cover 20 percent of land with forests by 2015, strengthened the coastal green belt and built 14,000 cyclone multi-purpose shelters, she said. But, the prime minister said, truly effective climate change adaptations "can only be addressed through enhanced and effective international cooperation." The prime minister told the Geneva meet, "Our agreement here would empower us in our efforts to reverse the alarming climatic trends, which are threatening our sheer existence." "Devising collective strategies based on informed decisions can improve the dire prognosis about our future," she said. She said the outcome of the Geneva talks must pave the way for adoption of an assured, adequate and easily accessible fund at the crucial Copenhagen climate conference in December. "It must also ensure affordable and eco-friendly technology transfer to developing countries, particularly Least Developed Countries (LDCs) side by side with all important specific commitments for deeper cuts in greenhouse gas emissions." Hasina flew to Switzerland on Tuesday, with foreign minister Dipu Moni and state minister for environment Hasan Mahmud, to attend the World Climate Conference 3 of the World Meteorological Organization. bd
