<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com)The total number of people infected by swine flu in Bangladesh on Thursday reached 275, as 16 more cases have been identified. Dr Mahmudur Rahman, the director at the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), said, "It's not important to count the patients. We are not even attempting to screen everyone with the H1N1 symptoms." "The most important action is to take the treatment urgently as soon as the symptoms show up." Three of the 16 most recently diagnosed patients arrived from abroad, he added. In a briefing held at IEDDR office, Dr Rahman said, "A lot of patients are coming to us. The apparent trends of the disease indicate that 98 percent of the affected should be getting well on their own." "The rate of swine flu infestation in Bangladesh is rather low. Only two percent warranting treatment again won't need hospitalisation. "Only those with serious respiratory troubles and other complications will need hospital admission." The press briefing notified all that the resident physicians of large hospitals outside Dhaka are being called in to Dhaka to train them in swine flu treatment methods from Sept 5. Rahman said stocks of necessary medicine are being scaled up at the districts and upazilas will also have stocks of the same. He said they would notify all about the latest swine flu situation every day at 11:30am at the IEDCR office. About the swine flu patients being admitted to the private hospitals, he said, "We have already sent medicine to the private hospitals and we are offering all cooperation. But they all must observe the basic rules of maintaining separate wards, so that the disease does not spread." He expressed hope that they would soon receive the newly invented swine flu vaccine. Fifteen private hospitals have meantime been brought under the swine flu management network, Dr Rahman said and added that some more will be included, if necessary. bd
