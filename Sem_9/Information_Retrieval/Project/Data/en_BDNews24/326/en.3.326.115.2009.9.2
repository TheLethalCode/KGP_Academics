 Rajshahi, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com)The indefinite bus strike called on Tuesday by the district road transport group in Rajshahi began on Wednesday. Since no one knows when the strike should end, the city commuters have been faced with immense sufferings. A lone Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation bus left Kumarparha depot on Wednesday morning for Charghat but was intercepted by the agitating transport workers picketing at Talaimari intersection. Police charged the protesting workers with baton and later, the bus left escorted by the police. No other bus left the depot after the incident. Kamal Hossain Robi, president of Rajshahi District Motor Workers' Association, told bdnews24.com that no-one had approached them with any discussion proposal and the strike would continue until their demands were met. The bus strike was called to demand withdrawal of BRTC's double-decker buses at upazila level and relocation of the inter-district bus terminal from Kumarparha to Naodaparha. Deputy commissioner Shefaul Karim said the administration is committed to keep operational the government-run bus service of BRTC. bdnews
