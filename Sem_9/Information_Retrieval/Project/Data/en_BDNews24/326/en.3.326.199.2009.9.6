 Rohan Ziad business correspondent Dhaka, Sep 6 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka Stock Exchange launched an OverTheCounter market on the country's premier bourse Sunday, with SEC chairman Ziaul Haque Khondker inaugurating the OTC trading floor at the DSE premises. The OTC has been set up as a separate trading station where buyers and sellers of non-performing, under-performing and delisted companies can announce prices and numbers of shares to be traded, a DSE statement said. However, market observers stressed an OTC market should not, according to international practice, be a dumping ground for junk shares. The move follows Securities and Exchange Commission directives to facilitate trading in under-performing shares, DSE president Rakibur Rahman said at the opening ceremony. The bourse, however, has no plans to place all 'Z Category' shares in the new market. "Non-operational and non-performing companies will be brought into the OTC market," DSE acting chief executive Satipati Moitra said at the launch. The OTC market initiative is not, however, new to the country's capital markets. In 2004, the Chittagong Stock Exchange established an OTC market, although it met with little success. Officials of the CSE said the initiative failed due to "non-cooperation from delisted companies". "Back then all CSE delisted companies were asked to enlist in the OTC market, but none came forward," AB Siddique, a former CEO of the port city bourse, told bdnews24.com on Sunday. Market experts fear the same could happen with the current DSE move. "The whole philosophy is wrong. OTC is not a market for junk shares," said mutual fund operator Yaweer Sayeed. "Rather it's a facility for companies which fall short of requirements to get listed on the main board," he said. "Delisted companies are declared bankrupt by the court and liquidated, before being distributed among shareholders. That's the global practice to deal with such issues," said Sayeed, the CEO of asset management firm AIMS of Bangladesh. The SEC chief, however, said he held high hopes for the market, and it would add "a new dimension to market transparency". "This initiative will send the message the SEC and DSE are aware of investors and eager to protect their interests," SEC chief Ziaul Haque Khondker told the opening ceremony. Khondker said delisted and non-operational companies as well as companies who had shares in "private equity" could be traded in the OTC market. But, most 'Z Category' companies are untraceable, with many having ceased operations. Trading 'Z Category' shares is nevertheless going on, as many retail investors are unaware of the companies' statuses. From early July, the market regulator suspended share trading on more than 30 low-profile companies. Meanwhile, the SEC sent a directive to the DSE on Sunday asking it to provide OTC market facilities to companies which were delisted non-voluntarily
