 Dhaka, Sep 5 (bdnews24.com)Three men, including two suspected extremists, were killed in encounters with law enforcers in three districts, Khulna, Pabna and Rajshahi, police said on Saturday. A 42-year old suspect, identified as 'Akkas', was killed in an encounter with RAB at 3am in front of the Hatiadanga Community Clinic at Koyra upazila, said Khulna police. Khulna police super Md Shamsuddin told bdnews24.com that Akkas was arrested Friday evening at the city's Khalishpur Housing Estate. Police and RAB launched a joint operation to recover arms from a gang in Koyra early Saturday taking Akkas with them as he had information about the suspects, said Shamsuddin. "The gang, who were gathered near the Hatiadanga clinic, opened fire at police. RAB and police had to reply with fire." He said Akkas took a bullet when he tried to escape during the drive. Police said a double barrel shotgun, a single barrel shotgun and seven rounds of ammunition were recovered from the scene. Akkas faced eight cases with different police stations in Khulna, said Shamsuddin. He was once arrested in an arms case in 2004.
