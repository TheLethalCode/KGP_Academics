 Rohan Ziad bdnews24.com business correspondent Dhaka, Sep 1 (bdnews24.com)The retail sector, experiencing sluggish sales so far for the time of year, is expecting the seasonal "boom in trade" from this weekend as extended shopping hours coincide with monthly pay cheques. Wholesalers are already reporting brisk trade as retailers from around the country stock up ahead of the rush. "The government's decision to allow shops to remain open until 10pm from the start of Ramadan has increased the flow of customers somewhat," Zohra Ferdous, who runs a fashion boutique in the capital, told bdnews24.com. But he says sales will really pick up from next weekend, after salaries and festival bonuses are paid. Ferdous said the previous timings had been inconvenient for office workers. The government had earlier strictly enforced 8pm shop closing times, especially in the capital, in a bid to conserve power. In the lead up to Ramadan, the prime minister gave the go-ahead to allow retailers to operate until 10pm on Fridays and Saturdays in the lead up to Eid. The business community, however, criticised the move, saying they would be inundated with shoppers on the weekends. On Aug 26, a meeting with retail sector leaders and the prime minister extended the late shopping hours to every day of the week during Ramadan. "But, at the moment, shoppers are just strolling around the market checking out the latest arrivals, rather than buying," Habibur Rahman, the manager of an outlet of Ecstasy in the city, told bdnews24.com. "The boom will start from this Friday, as most people will have been paid by then," said Md Jalaluddin, who runs a children's apparel shop at Rifles Square. Meanwhile, wholesale markets in the capital are already seeing their stocks fly. "I bought in a stock of clothing for about Tk 100,000, mostly children and women's items," said Alamgir Hossain, a retailer from Mymensingh, speaking at the city's Bangabazaar. Pir Yemeni Market, one of the largest wholesale markets at Gulistan, has seen a marked increase in business from last month. "Business has been good since mid-August ... retailers from throughout the country started to arrive since then," said Kalequzzaman, of Bithi Garments at the market. Kalequzzaman said some of his clients had now returned to the city for a second time in under a month to stock up on goods. Ganu Miah, a retailer from Tangil, said he had returned after around 20 days to restock his shops. "I brought clothes worth Tk 200,000 about two-and-a-half weeks ago, but I am here again to buy some more items, especially punjabis," said Miah, who added his sales would likely reach Tk 600,000 this season. Traders say punjabis, a traditional item, is in hot demand this year. A visit to Khalil Hazi's packed punjabi wholesale shop at Sharif Market in the capital confirmed the news. "This season is good compared to the last few years," said Hazi, who added his sales had already crossed Tk 4,000,000, this year, a figure he hoped to triple by Eid. Sales ahead of Eid, the country's largest festival, accounted for more than 40 percent of total annual turnover, according to traders. "We always look forward to this season, as everyone, irrespective class or income, buy a new outfit at this time of year," said Helaluddin Ahmed, president of the city's Shop Owners Association. Last year, wholesale and retail sales in Dhaka over Ramadan stood at around Tk 4,000 crore, and is expected to top Tk 6,000 crore this year, said Helaluddin. Meanwhile, the country as a whole last year witnessed total wholesale and retail turnover of Tk 35,000 crore, of which Tk 14,000 crore was made over Eid, according to the countrywide trade bodyBangladesh Shop Owners Association. President of the association, Amir Hossain Khan, said they expect this year's Eid sales to reach Tk 15,000 crore
