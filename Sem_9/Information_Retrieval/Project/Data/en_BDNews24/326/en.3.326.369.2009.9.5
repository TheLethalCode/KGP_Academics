 Faruque Iqbal bdnews24.com Chittagong bureau chief Chittagong, Sep 5 (bdnews24.com)The construction work of the country's lone river way container terminal, on the Buriganga at Pangaon in Narayanganj, is nearing completion, ushering in the possibility for transporting one hundred containers at a time from Chittagong port at minimum cost and time. The inland terminal equipped with back up facilities and linkages to the country's main seaport is expected to start handling containers on completion of its construction work next year, the Chittagong Port Authority said this week. Containers have until now been transported from Chittagong port to the capital by road and rail. Although transportation is relatively cheaper by rail, the high cost of road transportation greatly affects prices of goods. Port officials and business leaders view that container transportation by river might halve shipment costs and reduce risks. CPA chairman Commodore RU Ahmed told bdnews24.com, "The under construction inland container terminal at Pangaon is likely to launch its operation by mid or towards the end of 2010." Seventy percent of the construction is almost complete and other infrastructures including jetty is going on at full swing, Ahmed said Port officials estimated the construction cost of the new inland terminal at Tk 154 crore which might rise if further delayed. On completion of construction, the terminal would be capable of handling 116,000 TEU (twenty feet equal unit) containers annually, they said Port secretary Syed Forhad Uddin told bdnews24.com, "BIWTA has already awarded a work order to manufacture two specialised barge-type ships at Narayanganj dockyard for carrying containers from Chittagong port to Pangaon by waterway." On top of that enlistment of private organisations with experience in related fields is underway, Farhad said On waterway transportation of containers, Farhad said that it would be possible to transport at least one hundred containers at a time which is possible neither by rail nor road. He also said that though a good many containers could be transported by rail, there was scarcity of container wagons, which often leads to container jam. Chittagong Chamber of Commerce & Industries president, and former convener of the Waterway Transport Coordination Cell, MA Latif MP told bdnews24.com, "The port users are eagerly awaiting completion of Pangaon ICT as waterway shipments will halve expenditures resulting in positive impact on import and export of products." He said that shipment of a 20 or 40 feet container from Chittagong Port to Dhaka cost Tk 40-50,000 by road while it cost Tk 10,000 by rail. Latif said that there would be no need to unload Dhaka-bound containers from mother vessel at outer anchorage through lighter vessels once Pangaon ICT comes in to operation. Rather, containers could be transported to Pangaon ICT direct to Dhaka by specialised ships which would save both time and money, he said The CCCI president also said an option for waterway shipment of containers should be open for all, especially those operating coaster and lighter ships for container transportation to provide businessmen with competitive options. He said, enlistment of only a few companies might pose a barrier to the process as government officials or officials concerned might benefit unduly, which was not desirable. Latif said if there was option for open competition, private sector firms could supply required number of vessels, which might benefit both importers and exporters. BJMEA first vice-president Nasir uddin told bdnews24.com said Dhaka based businessmen would reap most benefit of the new ICT. b
