 Dhaka, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com)--Bangladesh's longest-serving finance minister M Saifur Rahman was buried on Monday at the family graveyard in Baharmardan of Moulavibazar after he died in a crash crash on Saturday. The veteran BNP policymaker, credited with liberalising the economy and presenting the budget for unprecedented 12 occasions, was laid to final rest at 5:30pm after a Namaj-e-janaza at Moulavibazar Government High School. The body reached the school ground at 3:45pm after a Janaza at Shahi Eidgah ground in Sylhet at around 12:50pm. The septuagenarian BNP leader passed his childhood playing in the school field. Thousands of people from the four districts in Sylhet division encircled the body to catch one last glimpse of man who singularly channelled scarce fund to develop the infrastructures in the region. Leaders and activists of local BNP, Awami League and other political parties placed flowers on his coffin in tribute. Many broke down in tears. Maulana Mizanur Rahman, former Imam of Rahman's village mosque, led the Janaza at 5pm. Moulavibazar district BNP's joint convenor M A Ahad said around 10,000 people participated in the funeral prayers. Awami League MP for Moulavibazar-4 Syed Mohsin Ali, former BNP foreign minister M Morshed Khan, BNP standing committee member A S M Hannan Shah, former BNP food minister Abdullah Al Noman, Sylhet district BNP convenor Mohammad Ilyas Ali, among others, attended the Janaza. Earlier, the ambulance carrying the veteran BNP leader from Dhaka reached Shahi Eidgah ground in Sylhet at around 12:50pm. People from across social and political spectrum paid their last tribute to Rahman at the Sylhet Central Shaheed Minar. Sylhet mayor Badaruddin Ahmed Kamran laid flowers on the coffin on behalf of all parties. Among those who attended the janaza were the mayor, Sylhet district BNP convener M Ilias Ali and metropolitan BNP president Shahriar Hossain Chowdhury, Sylhet district Awami League president ANM Shafiqul Haque, central AL organising secretary Misbah Uddin Siraj, Sylhet metropolitan Jamaat-e-Islami chief Ehsanul Mahbub Jubayer, former whip Fazlul Haque Aspia and former MPs Kalim Uddin Milon and Dildar Hossain Selim. Saifur Rahman was not only the pride of Sylhet, but the whole country, speakers said at a brief discussion held on the life of the former finance minister after the janaza. His loss is irreparable, they said. Senior BNP leader Abdullah Al Noman said it was due to Saifur's earnest efforts that Bangladesh government can now tailor budget without depending on others. Rahman's son Kaiser Rahman Titu requested all to pray for the salvation of the departed soul. He also sought forgiveness from all if his father did any wrong with anybody. Earlier, mayor Kamran, Ilias Ali and metropolitan BNP president Shahriar Hossain Chowdhury received the coffin. The coffin was kept at Central Shaheed Minar for the public to pay their last respects. BNP on Sunday demanded that the veteran leader should be buried with state honour. Secretary-general Khandaker Delwar Hossain made the demand to the government in a news conference at 11pm his old Dhaka house. Rahman's Qulkhwani will be held at Gulshan Azad Mosque on Friday after Asr prayers. Ruling and opposition members of parliament, family, friends, supporters and people from all walks of life paid tribute to the veteran politician in three separate namaj-e-janaza in the capital on Sunday. bdnew
