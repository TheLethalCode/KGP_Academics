<TITLE> Wimbledon exhibition proves costly to Venus </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Venus Williams scratched Wimbledon officials off her Christmas card list on Sunday. The American has long held the grasscourt major close to her heart as she has ruled supreme in London five times in the last decade. But the All England Club's decision to invite Kim Clijsters for an exhibition match in May to unveil its new multimillion-dollar roof over Centre Court cost the American dearly on Sunday. Playing against an opponent who was returning to action following a two-year hiatus, Williams was thumped 6-0, 0-6, 6-4 in the fourth round of the US Open. To add insult to injury, Clijsters also handed Williams her first 'bagel' set at the Open since 1997 -- when the American was just a precocious 17-year-old competitor rather than a seven-time Grand Slam champion ranked third in the world. For Williams, it felt as if Clijsters had never been away as she had also come off second best the last time they met, at the 2005 Open -- when the Belgian went on to win her sole major. "She always played well throughout her career, I'm sure she will continue to do that," said a glum Williams, who has been hampered by tendonitis in her left knee throughout the tournament. For Clijsters, who admitted that "until I started practising for that exhibition at Wimbledon, I never thought that I was going to be back," the remarkable victory was something she could only have dreamed about only a few weeks ago. "I can't believe it, I managed to beat Venus... this is one of the reasons I came back - to experience moments like this on the court again!," she said on her Twitter feed. After whacking a service winner past Williams on match point, she sank into her seat with the crowd still roaring in excitement. She buried her face with a towel, only to emerge with tears streaking down her face. "It was unbelievable. It was the emotions of that last game especially and the crowd and everything," the ecstatic 26-year-old, who took time out to start a family, told reporters. "It just all built up and it just came out as soon as it was over. Recalling the final game, she added: "My arm felt like 50 pounds or more. But I just told myself, 'Look, don't give it away like that. I was shaking." Chances are there are plenty more rivals who are now shaking at the prospect of facing Clijsters, who on this form could become the first mother to win a Grand Slam title since Australian Evonne Goolagong captured the Wimbledon crown in 1980. As for the officials who run a certain grasscourt tournament in a leafy suburb in southwest London -- they can look forward to getting a thank you note through the post from a grateful Bel
