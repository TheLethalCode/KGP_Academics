<TITLE> Place BRTA under police to ease Dhaka gridlock: panel </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary panel has observed that Bangladesh Road Transport Authority should be put directly under police administration to ease traffic snarls in capital Dhaka. "The police control traffic. We all blame the police for operation of unfit vehicles," Abdus Salam, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on the home ministry, said after a meeting at parliament building on Thursday. "The BRTA, under the communications ministry, issues fitness certificate, route permits and driving licences. So, the BRTA should go under the police for efficient traffic management," said Salam. The home ministry has been asking for years that the government put the BRTA under the police department but the proposal has faced stiff opposition from the communications ministry, mainly the Roads and Highways Department. Successive governments discussed the issue, but failed to do anything tangible.
