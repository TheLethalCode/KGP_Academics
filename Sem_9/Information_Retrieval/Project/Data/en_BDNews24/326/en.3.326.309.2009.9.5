<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 5 (bdnews24.com)An exhibition of dresses made by acid attack survivors opened in the city on Saturday, with hopes that a successful show would lead to a permanent outlet in Dhaka to benefit victims of the barbaric crime. "We're trying to provide survivors with an education, employment and a means to generate their own income," Parvin Mahmud, chairman of the Acid Survivors Foundation (ASF), told bdnews24.com. Mahmud said many acid attack victims were unable to return home and became cut off from their families due to social rejection and needed their own means of income. "Out of approximately 5,000 recorded victims of acid crime in the country to date, at least 1,500 have been given medical and psychological assistance by ASF in our own hospital," said Mahmud. She said it was imperative to ensure exemplary punishment for those guilty of acid crime in Bangladesh to reduce the incidence of future attacks. Project designer Shaila Akter said the programme initially trained five acid attack survivors for three months in dressmaking skills. "We are now hoping to expand the project and establish a permanent shop to sell goods made by the survivors," said Akter. Taslima Akhter, an acid attack survivor from Mymensingh, asked the public to support the initiative, saying: "With your help this small initiative will flourish." Australian High Commissioner Justin Lee opened the show, which launched the wider Naksha Ghor initiative for acid survivors, at the ASF Banani office. The programme is backed by the Australian Small Scheme Human Rights Grand Fund. The show will be open to the public till Sep 7 at House 12, Road 22, Block-K in Banani. b
