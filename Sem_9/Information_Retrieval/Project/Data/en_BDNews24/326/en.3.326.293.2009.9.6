<TEXT>
 Khulna,Sep 05(bdnews24.com) Shipping minister Shajahan Khan has said the planned construction of a long-proposed deep sea port at Sonadia in Kutubdia, Chittagong, could pose a "security risk" being close to the Myanmar border. He suggested Akram Point near Mongla would as a more suitable location. "Security risk may loom large if a deep sea port is constructed at Sonadia, very close to Myanmar border," the minister said at an open discussion at a Khulna hotel on Saturday. "From view point of security, it would be more reasonable to install deep sea port at Akram Point, and the construction of the Padma Bridge would enhance the importance of Mongla Port," Khan said. He said the government was already moving to dredge the river Pashur in Mongla to restore greater navigability. "Long-term plans have been chalked out to develop and modernise Mongla port, which could rise to be the greatest sea port in Bangladesh," said Khan, who took over the reins of the shipping ministry from Afsarul Amin after a cabinet reshuffle at the end of July With its geographic location, Bangladesh is looking to the long-proposed deep-sea port to make it a major player in regional trade and act as a gateway to the region. A feasibility study for the proposed deep-sea port project, undertaken by a Japanese consulting firm, suggested the Sonadia-Moheshkhali point as the best location as recently as April. Japan's Pacific Consultant International (PCI) said the deep-sea port could be set up at Sonadia channel in three phases until 2055 at a cost of $ 1.2 billion with the first phase completed by 2016. Sonadia Island succeeded so far as the best optimal location for a deep sea port out of nine possible locations, PCI said in its 'Techno-Economic Feasibility Study of a Deep Sea Port in Bangladesh'. The present government has also said work would start on a three-phase construction of the deep-sea port by the end of the next year Khan's predecessor Amin had said last July that the first phase of the work in the Sonadia Island in Cox's Bazar at a cost of Tk 13,000 crore was expected to end by 2015. Amin was optimistic that the port would be operational after the first phase of work and the second segment would start between 2016 and 2017. Together with the second and the final stage, the work has been estimeated to cost Tk 60,000 crore and end in 2055. The deep-sea port could handle 75 million tonnes of cargo a year by 2020 against just one million tonnes at the country's existing seaport in Chittagong, KM Ahmed, project coordinator of Pacific Consultants International told bdnews24.com in July. PCI's master plan of the port envisages this eventually rising to 325 million tonnes. Shahjahan Khan was focused on Mongla port on Saturday. Khan said just last month that long-standing problems with Mongla Port would have to be resolved before construction of the ambitious Padma Bridge at Mawa is completed. Khan said he believes Mongla Port will emerge as the country's major port once construction of the Padma bridge goes ahead as planned. He also said on Saturday that parks and tourist centres would be developed, centered around the Sundarbans, in the Khulna region, which includes Mongla. There would be arrangements for a cable car over the Sundarbans so that tourists could enjoy the flora and fauna of the forest safely, he said The minister also said an overseas firm had offered to invest Tk 2000 crore in the area, but he declined to name the firm. Chaired by Greater Khulna Development Coordination Committee president, Liakat Ali, the key paper of Saturday's discussion was presented by Khulna University Professor Shahanewaj Nazimuddin. The state minister for labour and employment Mannujan Sufian said Mongla port had been left to ruin during the past BNP-led alliance government. bdn
