 Dhaka, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com)At least 22 people, including professor Anu Muhammad, were injured in the capital on Wednesday after police baton charged demonstrators attempting to besiege Petrobangla headquarters over recent exploration deals granted to two international companies. Around 500 people participated in a rally organised by the National Committee to Protect Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources, Power and Portsa public pressure groupwhich marched towards state-owned Petrobangla headquarters at Karwan Bazar from Muktangan at midday. The rally was intercepted by police at Paltan and in the ensuing melee police mounted a baton charge that left committee member secretary Prof Anu Muhammed and dozens others injured. In response, demonstrators pelted the police with stones leaving several vehicles damaged during the half-hour clash. Traffic on the Kakrail-Paltan road was also suspended. While receiving treatment Prof Muhammed, a teacher of economics at Jahangirnagar University, told bdnews24.com: "We were peacefully observing our programme when the police beat us without any reason. Several people were injured in the incident." "We waged this movement to protect the assets of the country. We are not against the government. "It is the government's responsibility to protect the life and property of citizens. I cannot understand why this incident took place," said Prof Muhammed. Convenor of the committee, Sheikh Shahidullah, later told reporters the government must cancel offshore oil and gas exploration deals in the Bay of Bengal to two international companies, ConocoPhillips and Tullow Oil plc, by Sept 10. Shahidullah, speaking at the Communist Party of Bangladesh office, said another procession would be organised on Sept 10 to the prime minister's office after a programme at Muktangan if the government failed to cancel the offshore deals. He also warned of a wider programme, including strikes and further sieges if the government did not fulfil the demands. Shahidullah said 35 leaders and activists of the citizens' action group were injured in the police attack and were currently receiving medical treatment at different hospitals. He demanded the police responsible for the attack are punished for obeying "illegal orders from their seniors". "The government leased out the gas blocks to foreign companies on the condition they get 80 percent of the gas, where in fact 100 percent would go to them," said Shahidullah. He also alleged the gas blocks were allocated to the foreign companies as repayment of a debt to "imperial groups" who helped the government to power. On Aug 24, Bangladesh approved offshore oil and gas exploration deals with ConocoPhillips and Tullow Oil plc in three sea blocks in the resource-rich Bay, although the deals stipulated that they would not be permitted to operate in any disputed waters in the areas.
