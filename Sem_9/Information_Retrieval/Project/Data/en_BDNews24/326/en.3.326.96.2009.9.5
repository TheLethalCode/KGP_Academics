 Dhaka, Sept (bdnews24.com)The Association of Private Universities of Bangladesh (APUB) on Saturday demanded immediate cancellation of the proposed Private University Act 2009, saying current legislation was adequate. "The autonomy and freedom of private universities will be affected if the bill is passed into law," APUB vice-chairman Abul Kashem Haider told a press briefing at the National Press Club auditorium. The new law on private universities has been designed with strict provisions to deal with irregularities in the sector. Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid told bdnews24.com on Friday that private universities, leaving one or two, disregard the law in running affairs. "But we're going to enact the amended Private University Act 2009 soon with strict measures to supervise their activities," the minister said. Haider said on Saturday the proposed legislation would unnecessarily increase governmental control over private universities. The law would also hamper private initiatives for tertiary education in Bangladesh and lead to a brain drain, as the most brilliant students went overseas for their education, he said. Haider said many of the most common complaints against private universities, including distance learning programmes, establishing secondary campuses and supplying certificates from foreign universities, were actually incorporated in the proposed bill. "APUB thinks proper implementation of the existing 1992 and 1998 laws could resolve all irregularities in the sector. The government is making new laws rather than implementing existing legislation," he said. The APUB vice-chairman also said corruption in the education sector would increase if private universities were permitted to operate on a temporary basis. He said APUB also strongly protested sections in the proposed legislation relating to easing restrictions on establishing university campuses and giving more power to the University Grants Commission. There are 54 private universities operating in Bangladesh at present. bdnew
