 Dhaka, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson and former prime minister Khaleda Zia expressed her deep shock Saturday over the death of M Saifur Rahman, veteran BNP leader and former finance minister, calling it "an irreparable loss" for her party and the country. Rahman was pronounced dead at Brahmanbaria Sadar Hospital at around 3pm following a road accident on the Dhaka-Sylhet highway. His sudden death drew condolences from parties and fellow politicians across the spectrum. "The nation has lost a wise politician. It is an irreparable loss that has caused a huge vacuum in national politics," Khaleda said in a condolence message. She prayed for peace for the departed soul and extended her sympathy to the bereaved family. She also described his eventful life. "He played a vital role in establishing the BNP and later in its organising work as well as being a close confidante of president Ziaur Rahman." "He played a significant role in re-establishing democracy ... He had a vast role, too, in repairing the country's devastated economy and establishing it on a strong footing." "We worked together for a long time. He helped me greatly as an honest and skilled colleague in running the government. As a wise economist, he won national and international renown." Khaleda later visited the Rahman residence after his body reached the Gulshan house at around 7.45pm on Saturday night. She arrived at 8.30pm and paid her respects standing before the coffin. She also consoled his sons and daughter. BNP secretary general Khandakar Delwar Hossain, former speaker Jamiruddin Sarkar, standing committee members Khandakar Mosharaf Hossain, Maudud Ahmed and M Shamsul Islam were among the party leaders present. Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mujaheed, secretary general of BNP ally Jamaat-e-Islami was also there. State minister for home Shamsul Huq Tuku, Worker's Party chief Rashed Khan Menon MP and Jatiya Party leader Hasanul Huq Inu MP also paid their respects at the house on Saturday. They expressed deep sympathy for the grieving members of the family. bdnews2
