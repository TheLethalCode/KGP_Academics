 Cox's Bazar, Sep 6 (bdnews24.com)Seven fishing trawlers were confirmed to have gone down in the Bay of Bengal and 30 others remain missing, officials said Sunday, after a depression over the coastal belt led to squally weather and rough seas over the weekend. The 37 trawlers went missing on Friday. Thirteen fishermen were rescued from one of the capsized trawlers, although at least 80 more seamen from the seven stricken vessels are still missing, a trawler association official said. He said at least 400 more crew from the 30 still-missing trawlers were also unaccounted for. Two rescued seamen, Abdur Rahim and Kabir Ahmed, said they had been trying to return to the Cox's Bazar coast for two days before their vessel succumbed to the rough seas. Rahim and Ahmed said they regularly faced potentially fatal situations at sea as there were no lighthouses or marker buoys along the Cox's Bazar shore. Joint-convener of Cox's Bazar Fishing Trawler Owners Association, Nurul Islam, told bdnews24.com at least 80 trawlers had taken shelter along the coast up to 6pm on Sunday. Another official of the association, Moshtaq Ahmed, said they had identified six of the sunken trawlers, although one was yet to be named. They are the FB Mobareka, FB Ziauddin, FB Bhai Bhai, FB Bhai Bhai-1, FB Rupa and FB Rafique. Moshtaq said a trawler from Chittagong rescued the 13 fishermen of the FB Bhai Bhai-1 on Saturday morning. bdn
