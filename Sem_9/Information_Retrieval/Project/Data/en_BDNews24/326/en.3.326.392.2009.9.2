<TITLE> Australia coach Nielsen to head home for a break </TITLE>

 MELBOURNE Sep 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia cricket coach Tim Nielsen, who presided over the team's 2-1 Ashes defeat last month, will return home after the fourth one-day international against England, Cricket Australia (CA) said Wednesday. "The Australian team has played back-to-back international cricket since September 2008 and looking at the busy schedule over the next 12 months, we believe it is the right time for Tim to take a break," CA general manager of cricket Michael Brown said in a statement. "This will provide an excellent opportunity for Tim's assistant, Troy Cooley, to continue his professional development by stepping up as acting coach for the remainder of the tour." Cooley would take the reins for the remaining three one-day matches, CA said, while Nielsen would rejoin the squad in South Africa on September 22 for the ICC Champions Trophy. Nielsen, who took over from John Buchanan in 2007, has led Australia to three losses in their past five Test series and his position has come under greater scrutiny in the wake of the Ashes defeat.
