 Dhaka, Sept 4 (bdnews24.com)--Leaders of several garment workers' organisations have demanded the payment of their wages and Eid allowances by the 20th day of Ramadan to celebrate the biggest religious festival in the country. They also appealed to the government to ensure the pay from processions and rallies held at Muktangan in the capital on Friday. Jatiya Sramik Jote president Shirin Akhtar warned against dilly-dallying over the payment and slammed apparel exporters' association BGMEA for seeking Tk 3000 crore from the government to clear pay and bonuses. Among others, organising secretary of the Jote M Habibur Rahman Shawkat spoke. Leaders of Bangladesh Garments Sramik Oikya Parisad demanded that workers should be given paid wages and allowances by 20th Ramadan. Garment workers are no government employees, and factory owners are responsible for paying them, they said. President of the Parisad Sirajul Islam Ronnie presided over the rally where Rokeya Sultana Anju and M N Zaman Chowdhury also spoke. bd
