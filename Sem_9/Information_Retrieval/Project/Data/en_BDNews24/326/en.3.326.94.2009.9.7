<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com)--People from across social and political spectrum paid their last tribute on Monday to former finance minister M Saifur Rahman at the Sylhet Central Shaheed Minar. Sylhet mayor Badaruddin Ahmed Kamran laid flowers on the coffin on behalf of all parties. The ambulance carrying the veteran BNP leader reached at Shahi Eidgah ground at around 12:50pm where a namaj-e-janaza was held. Another namaj-e-janaza would be held at Moulavi Bazar Government High School. Rahman, the longest-serving finance minister, would be later buried in the family graveyard in Baharmardan village of Moulavibazar. Among those who attended the janaza were the mayor, Sylhet district BNP convener M Ilias Ali and metropolitan BNP president Shahriar Hossain Chowdhury, Sylhet district Awami League president ANM Shafiqul Haque, central AL organising secretary Misbah Uddin Siraj, Sylhet metropolitan Jamaat-e-Islami chief Ehsanul Mahbub Jubayer, former whip Fazlul Haque Aspia and former MPs Kalim Uddin Milon and Dildar Hossain Selim. Saifur Rahman was not only the pride of Sylhet, but the whole country, speakers said at a brief discussion held on the life of the former finance minister after the janaza. His loss is irreparable, they said. Senior BNP leader Abdullah Al Noman said it was due to Saifur's earnest efforts that Bangladesh government can now tailor budget without depending on others. Rahman's son Kaiser Rahman Titu requested all to pray for the salvation of the departed soul. He also sought forgiveness from all if his father did any wrong with anybody. Earlier, mayor Kamran, Ilias Ali and metropolitan BNP president Shahriar Hossain Chowdhury received the coffin. The coffin was kept at Central Shaheed Minar for the public to pay their last respects. BNP on Sunday demanded that the veteran leader should be buried with state honour. Secretary-general Khandaker Delwar Hossain made the demand to the government in a news conference at 11pm his old Dhaka house. Rahman's Qulkhwani will be held at Gulshan Azad Mosque on Friday after Asr prayers. Rahman, one of BNP senior-most leaders and Bangladesh's longest-serving finance minister, was killed in a car crash on the Dhaka-Sylhet highway on Saturday afternoon. Ruling and opposition members of parliament, family, friends, supporters and people from all walks of life paid tribute to the veteran politician in three separate namaj-e-janaza in the capital on Sunday. bdnew
