 Abdur Rahim Harmachi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Sep 03 (bdnews24.com)Remittance hit yet another new high in August, with $937.9 million sent back by Bangladeshi workers overseas, marking a 30 percent rise from August of last year and breaking all previous monthly records. Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman told bdnews24.com on Thursday evening. "It is undoubtedly a good sign for our economy to see a rise in inflow of remittance even amid the global meltdown." Rahman said he expects that the economy as a whole will remain unaffected by any major recession fallout in future. "But, the present trend of remittance flow will must be harnessed for investment in productive sectors, other wise inflation may soar," he said "The global recession is discouraging large investments, however, so investment should be diverted to small and medium industries." According to the Bangladesh Bank's forex reserve & treasury department, August, the second month of FY 2009-10, saw the biggest remittance flow in a single month. June saw $919.1 million remittance which was the highest inflow at the time. July, the first month of current fiscal year, saw a dip to $886.4 million but was slightly up on $885.3 million in July of last year. According to Bangladesh Bank, the country saw $9.69 billion in remittance in FY 2008-09 compared to $7.91billlion during FY 2007-08 Meanhwile, foreign currency reserves have crossed $9 billion, an all-time high. On Thursday, they amounted to $9.19 billion, enough to meet import expenditure for more than six months. Continuing growth of remittance and a recent IMF loan of $700 million have pushed reserves up, Rahman said Over the past year, development partners World Bank, IMF and ADB feared that one of the main indices of the Bangladesh economy, remittance, might fall sharply as overseas workers lost their jobs due to the recession. Local economists echoed the same apprehension. But the present scenario appears to have belied the concerns. According to the expatriate welfare and overseas employment ministry, at present some 6.5 million Bangladeshi expatriates are employed in different countries of the world. Some 350,000 flew abroad since January, according to the ministry. bd
