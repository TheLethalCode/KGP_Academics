<TITLE> Bright future seen for Bangladeshi solar pump </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 6 (bdnews24.com)The Renewable Energy Research Centre at Dhaka University has invented a low-cost solar water pump, which they hope will drastically reduce the cost of irrigation for farmers in Bangladesh. "The pump is highly cost effective and will allow farmers to irrigate more land for less money," Prof Nimchandra Bhaumik, director of RERC, told at a press briefing at the centre's premises on Sunday. Prof Bhaumik said the pump's superiority lay in its RERC developed invertors, devices that allow pumps to operate at reduced speeds, therefore cutting energy costs. He said RERC's new design was a two-horsepower pump powered by 14 solar panels. "Our locally manufactured pump will be good for 15 years, while its solar panels should last at least 25 years," he said. Prof Bhaumik said he was seeking governmental support to disseminate the solar pumps to farmers, particularly those living in off-grid areas. He said it should be possible to produce two-horsepower solar pumps in Bangladesh for Tk 700,000, while in future six-horsepower could be available for Tk 2,000,000 and ten-horsepower for Tk 4,200,000. He said foreign made pumps cost up to six times that amount, and usually come with only a one-year guarantee. "Diesel oil powered irrigation is much more expensive for farmers," he said. Prof Bhaumik said almost 65 percent of the country's agricultural land was not adequately irrigated, and access to cheaper alternatives could bring about an agricultural revolution. b
