 Dhaka, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com)--The Supreme Court has stayed until Oct 4 a High Court order that granted former telecommunication minister Aminul Haque bail in the Barapukuria graft case. The Appellate Division chamber judge S K Sinha made the order on Thursday on a government petition. Attorney general Mahbubey ALam represented the state while former attorney general A J Mohammad Ali stood for Haque. The BNP leader secured bail from the High Court on Aug 27 in this and five other cases. The Anticorruption Commission filed the Barapukuria case in February, 2007. The prosecution also petitioned for staying the five cases. But the chamber judge did not give any order. Other cases include a case on charges of corruption in the installation of two bridges in Rajshahi filed with Tanor Police Station in the district in October, 2007. Four other cases were filed for abetting the executed chief of the banned Islamist militant outfit Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh, Siddiqul Islam, better known as 'Bangla Bhai'. Three cases were filed with Atrai Police Station in Rajshahi in 2006 and the other one in April, 2007. b
