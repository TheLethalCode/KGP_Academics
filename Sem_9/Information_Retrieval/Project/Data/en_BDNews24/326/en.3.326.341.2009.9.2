 Golam Mortuza Antu bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com)At least 22 people were injured on Wednesday in the capital as police clubbed demonstrators who attempted to besiege Petrobangla headquarters over recent exploration deals with international companies, witnesses said. Progressive Students' Front, a combine of left-leaning student organisations, marched down the Dhaka University campus in protest against the police assault. The demonstrators of the National Committee to Protect Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources, Power and Ports, numbering nearly 500, marched towards the state-owned Petrobangla headquarters at Karwan Bazar with a scheduled procession from Muktangan at midday. They were intercepted by police at Paltan. As the demonstrators tried to break free, police charged them with baton that left committee member secretary professor Anu Muhammed and dozens others injured. The demonstrators hurled stones at police. Several vehicles were also damaged during the half-hour clash. The traffic on Kakrail-Paltan road was also suspended. The committee members sat in a meeting at the Communist Party of Bangladesh office in Paltan. Anu Muhammed told bdnews24.com while receiving treatment: "We were peacefully observing our programme. But police intercepted and beat us without any reason. Several people were injured in the incident." A professor of economics at the Jahangirnagar University, Muhammed condemned the police atrocity. "We have waged this movement to protect the assets of the country. We are not against the government. "It is the government's responsibility to protect the life and property of the citizens. "But I cannot understand why this incident took place," Muhammed added. AMong those injured are Biplobi Workers Party leader Saiful Haque, Gonotantrik Biplobi Party leader Moshrefa Mishu, Bangladesher Samajtantrik Dal leader Bazlur Rashid Firoz, Abu Naser Sabuj, Rahat Ahmed, Biplob Mandal, Mintu Biswas, Keshab Lal Samaddar, Eva Biswas, Roksana Afroz, Sangeeta Barai, 'Anita', Tania Alam, Afsana Sumi, Tapashi Rabeya Ankhi, Fahmida Mouri, Jasmine Akhter, Kawser Ahmed and Mohammed Mohsin. They received first aid. Committee convener Sheikh Mohammad Shahidullah told bdnews24.com that they had called a news conference at 4pm at the CPB office where they would announce their next move. He said the latest incident only goes to show that the government is working against the interest of the country. Those who work to protect people's interest are facing harassment, he alleged. Earlier, the committee held a rally in Muktangan. Shahidullah, justice Golam Rabbani, Syed Abul Maksud, CPB general secretary Mujahidul Islam Selim, Gono Front leader Tipu Biswas, CPB leader Ruhin Hosain Prince, AN Rasheda, Bangladesher Samajtantrik Dal leader Bazlur Rashid Firoz addressed the rally. The committee on Saturday called the protest programme against the government's recent decision to award gas exploration rights in the Bay of Bengal to foreign companies. It said the prime minister's approval of offshore oil and gas exploration deals in the Bay to two international companies, ConocoPhillips and Tullow Oil plc, ran counter to her campaign pledges. "The government is trading on the nation's assets by allocating oil and gas rights in the Bay to multinational companies," Sheikh Shahidullah, the group's convener, told reporters at a press briefing at Mukti Bhaban in the city on Saturday. "We won't let a single drop of oil or gas leave the country," said Shahidullah In addition to the planned siege at the Petrobangla headquarters, Shahidullah said protests would also be held out at UNO offices around the country. On Aug 24, Bangladesh approved offshore oil and gas exploration deals with the two companies in three sea blocks in the resource-rich Bay, although the deals stipulated that they would not be permitted to operate in any disputed waters in the areas. Shahidullah said his group demanded cancellation of the Model Production Sharing Contract 2008, adopted by the last caretaker government, saying pressure from "colonialists" had been behind it. "The present government has decided to allow 80 percent export of our resources by multinational companies ConocoPhillips and Tullow Oil on a tender based on the anti-public interest model, devised during the tenure of the previous unelected government," said Shahidullah. Anu Muhammad said the present government was not working as the true representative of the people. "The energy ministry and Petrobangla are working for multinational companies," said Mohammad. "Now three of 28 blocks have been allocated to international companies, then gradually the rest will also be given over to them," he said. Also attending the press briefing, Communist Party general-secretary Mujahidul Islam Selim said prime minister Sheikh Hasina had told the US president Bill Clinton in 2000 that Bangladesh gas would not be sold without ensuring a 50 year supply for the country. "After such a promise, this latest agreement is extremely treacherous," said Selim. The government on Aug 24 approved offshore oil, gas exploration deals with ConocoPhillips and Tullow Oil plc in three sea blocks. The companies, however, will not be able to operate in any disputed waters of the blocks in the resource-rich Bay of Bengal. ConocoPhillips, the third largest energy company in the US, will get deep-sea blocks 10 and 11. Shallow-sea block 5 will be awarded to Irish company Tullow that already operates in Bangladesh's Bhangura gas field. bd
