<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 4 (bdnews24.com)--Former health minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain has slammed the recent government move to appoint 6000 doctors on ad-hoc basis sidestepping the Public Service Commission, terming it 'illegal and politically motivated'. He said if his Bangladesh Nationalist Party formed government, all such recruitments would be cancelled. "Appointing doctors on ad-hoc basis is illegal as such appointments are to be made by the PSC," Mosharraf said at a meeting of Doctors Association of Bangladesh (DAB), a pro-BNP organisation, on Friday. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina announced on Apr 10 that the government would appoint the doctors to offset the crippling shortage of physicians at public hospitals. She said the doctors may be appointed on an ad hoc basis, and will be regularised, subject to their coming through the BCS examinations. "The service sector has already lost its efficiency for nepotism and favouritism," Mosharraf said."People are being deprived of health care facilities," he claimed. He demanded immediate release of DAB secretary Dr A Z M Zahid Hossain who was arrested on charge of submitting false wealth statement to the Anticorruption Commission. "The government is not keeping any promises it made earlier to the people. Rather, it is very much after serving the purposes of the foreign countries," BNP standing committee member alleged. He also blamed the government for the price hike, extortions, tender-rigging, deteriorating law and order. Chaired by the DAB president A K M Azizul Haq, the meeting was addressed by former state for health Mizanur Rahman Sinha and acting DAB secretary SM Rafiqul Islam. b
