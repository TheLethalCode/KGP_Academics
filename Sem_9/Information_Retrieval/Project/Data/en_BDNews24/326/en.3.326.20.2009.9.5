 Dhaka, Sep 02 (bdnews24.com)  The government wants to hear from the public on policy recommendations put forward by a national committee to bring changes to the country's troubled education system, education minister Nurul Islam Nahid said Saturday. He said the National Education Policy 2009, submitted to the government last week, would be available on the ministry's website so that people can give their inputs. Hanid said the government was keen to bring in changes to the education system, and to that end the administration would start implementing the recommendations from this year. He made the statement Saturday at a roundtable discussion on education organised by Bangla-language daily Samakal at CIRDAP auditorium in the city. The government announced the formation of a national committee to craft an education policy, in April, with Professor Kabir Chowdhury at the helm. It submitted its final recommendations to the government Wednesday. The recommendations include extending compulsory primary education up to class eight and higher secondary level from IX to class XII, introducing uniform curricula, modernising madrasa studies and forming a national education commission. Former adviser to the military-backed caretaker government Rasheda K Chowdhury said, "Common people should be made aware of the recommendations on the issue of female education mentioned in the education policy." Moderated by Samakal editor Golam Sarwar, the roundtable was also addressed by Rashed Khan Menon MP, UGC chairman Professor Nazrul Islam, Dhaka University professor Syed Anwar Hossain and National University treasurer Kazi Faruk Ahmed. bdn
