A further 28 were killed elsewhere in clashes with insurgents and airstrikes on suspected militant hideouts. The Khyber is one of seven Pakistani regions with a high degree of autonomy based on tribal laws. On August 27 a suicide bomber killed 22 border guards at the main crossing to Afghanistan. Helicopter gunships and fighter planes also pounded militant positions in the tribal region of Orakzai that borders Khyber, and intelligence officials said there had been casualties. In Swat, security forces killed a militant commander and arrested five others, according to a military statement. Seven more militants surrendered to security forces.
