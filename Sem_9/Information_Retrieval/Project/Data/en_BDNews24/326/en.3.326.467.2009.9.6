<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com)The Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (BELA) served a legal notice on Kabir Steel Ltd on Sunday, for compensation to the families of five ship yard workers seriously injured in a fire, one of whom died, saying the accident occurred because of negligence over workplace safety. The five workers, breaking up a Korean vessel, suffered critical burns on Saturday as fire broke out at the ship breaking yard of Kabir Steel at Baro Aulia in Sitakunda. One worker later succumbed to his injuries at Chittagong Medical College Hospital. The notice accuses Kabir Steel of unauthorised ship-breaking operations lacking an environmental clearance certificate from the proper authority. It also blamed the owners of the yard for not putting adequate safety measures in place in line with previous directives of the High Court. BELA lawyer Md Iqbal Kabir sent the legal notice, also served on 10 others including environment secretary, home secretary, labour secretary, industry secretary, inland navigation secretary, director general of the environment directorate. The notice said the latest incident demonstrated that many ship yards were still operating without adequate safety arrangement, and pollution continues unabated. The notice stated that BELA had earlier filed more than one writ petition involving pollution control and safety of workers in ship-breaking yards. On March 17, the High Court in response to a public interest litigation case gave a number of directives regarding entry of ships with toxic elements to Bangladesh waters. The directives also spelled out measures against pollution by ship breaking yards and ensuring worker safety. The High Court ruled that without proper scrutiny of a ship and review of relevant information and ensuring proper infrastructure in relation to pollution control, no imported vessel could enter the country. At the same time before import of any ship for the purpose of breaking, it has to be freed from toxic elements for entry to Bangladesh. The higher court had also ordered closure of 36 yards, which run without proper clearance. Following an appeal by the Bangladesh Shipbreakers Association against the directives, the chamber judge of the Appellate Division stayed parts of the High Court order. bdne
