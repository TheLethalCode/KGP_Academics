<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com)The government plans no separate law to stop extrajudicial penalties such as 'caning' on Fatwa in village arbitration, the law minister said on Monday. "There is no legal basis of whipping. It is an illegal practice," Shafique Ahmed replied to a query by reserved women seat's MP Begum Salma Islam. "If any person is tortured physically or punished or disgruntled they can file a case against the illegal activity in line with existent law," the minister said. "The government has no plan to formulate any separate law to stop whipping," he added. The High Court on Aug 25 ordered the government, law-enforcing agencies, union parishads and municipalities to immediately act against those who slap extra-judicial penalties such as beating or caning in village courts and provide security and protection to the victims. The third session of parliament reconvened at 11am on Monday. Replying to another query by Feni-3 MP Muhammad Moquarram Hossain, Ahmed said that the government had appointed nine judges to the High Court Division of the Supreme Court and 11 as permanent judges. Four High Court judges were also given appointment to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, he said. bdnews24.
