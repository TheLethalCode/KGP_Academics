 BERLIN, Sep 6, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Defence Minister Franz Josef Jung defended his troops on Sunday for calling in a NATO air strike in Afghanistan and warned against hasty judgments over the most deadly operation involving German forces since World War Two. Three weeks before a federal election, Jung tried to dispel growing doubts about Germany's increasingly military mission in Afghanistan that were exacerbated by the air strike near Kunduz. Afghan officials say scores of people, many of them civilians, were killed when a US F-15 fighter jet called in by German troops struck two hijacked fuel trucks on Friday. Because of Germany's belligerent past, the country has kept a tight leash on its military and only reluctantly began deploying troops on peacekeeping missions in the 1990s. The Afghan mission has become unpopular in Germany as its nature has shifted in the once-safe northern Kunduz province. "The air strike was absolutely necessary," Jung told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. "I can't comprehend how some can so quickly criticise the military action without knowing what the situation was or the background information." European Union foreign ministers criticised NATO on Saturday for the air strike, saying it could undermine the Western effort in Afghanistan. Jung, who has repeatedly said Germany is not engaged in "war" in Afghanistan, said German officers had "very detailed information" collected over several hours about the two hijacked fuel trucks. "We had clear information that the Taliban had seized both fuel trucks about six kilometres away from our base in order to launch an attack against our soldiers in Kunduz," Jung said of the attack, ordered by a local German commander. "If that had succeeded, it would have had horrible consequences for our soldiers. That's why, in my view, the commander made the right decision ... Based on the information I got, only Taliban terrorists were killed in the strike." Germany has 4,200 troops in Afghanistan, making it the third largest contingent after the United States and Britain. So far 35 Germans have been killed, the last three in June. Opinion polls show two-thirds of Germans oppose the mission, but it has not become a campaign issue as both ruling parties, Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and Vice Chancellor Frank-Walter Steinmeier's Social Democrats, agree troops must stay. The conservatives have been on alert for attacks on German forces in the run-up to the election, aimed at influencing German public opinion. Several opposition parties want Germany to leave Afghanistan. "We are facing a critical challenge at this time," Jung told reporters on Saturday. "We are aware of Taliban declarations targeting the German army due to the electi
