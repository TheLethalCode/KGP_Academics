 Dhaka, Sept 4 (bdnews24.com)Thirty-four public university teachers and researchers have condemned Wednesday's police atrocities on the National Committee on Protection of Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources and Power and Ports of late and the injury to committee secretary professor Anu Muhammad. In a statement issued on Friday, the university teachers also demanded that the perpetrators of the excesses are heavily punished. "We express our solidarity with the national committee's demand for cancellation of any agreement with any foreign company to mine and sell our oil-gas-mineral resources in a manner detrimental to our national interests." Around 500 demonstrators of the national committee were marching towards Petrobangla head office at Karwan Bazar in a procession demanding cancellation of recent offshore oil and gas exploration deals in the Bay of Bengal with two international companies when police attacked them at Paltan. They charged the demonstrators with baton, injuring over 50. The statement issuers included Dhaka University professor Sirajul Islam Chowdhury, KAM Sa'ad Uddin, Ajay Roy, Ahmed Kamal, Akmal Hossain, AK Manwar Uddin Ahmed, Abul Barakat, Sadeka Halim, Md Samad, Monirul Islam Khan, Nurul Islam, Nurur Rahman Khan, Shafiq Uz Zaman, M Wahiduzzaman Chan, AKM Salauddin, Aman Ullah Ferdous, Masuduzzaman, Md Tazim Uddin Khan, Harun Ur Rashid, MM Akash, Rajshahi University's Hasan Azizul Haque, Malay Bhowmik, SM Abu Bakar, Suranjit Sarkar, Shamsuddin Ilias, Ali Reza Opu, Shatil Siraj, Chittagong University's Moinul Islam, Irshad Kamal Khan, Sylhet Shah Jalal University's Muhammad Zafar Iqbal, Reza-e-Karim Khandaker, Sushanto Kumar Das, Yasmine Haque and Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology's M Shamsul Alam. The government on Thursday said the police assault was 'unexpected and sad'. The home ministry said in a statement said authorities will take legal action against the law-enforcers if any excesses were committed by any member linked to the clash. Convenor of the committee Sheikh Shahidullah said another procession would be organised on Sept 10 to the prime minister's office after a programme at Muktangan if the government failed to cancel the offshore deals. He also warned of a wider programme, including strikes and further sieges if the government did not fulfil the demands. On Aug 24, Bangladesh approved offshore oil and gas exploration deals with ConocoPhillips and Tullow Oil plc in three sea blocks in the resource-rich Bay, although the deals stipulated that they would not be permitted to operate in any disputed waters in the areas. b
