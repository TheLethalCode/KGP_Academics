<TITLE> TSS to make phones for local market </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com)The first locally manufactured mobile phone sets are set to hit the market by next January, while Bangladeshi made digital land phones will be available this month, an official said on Wednesday. The state-owned Telephone Shilpa Sangsta is looking to manufacture and market mobile-phone sets for between Tk 1,500 to Tk 10,000, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on post and telecommunications told reporters at the parliament media centre. "The committee also recommended the ministry prepare a master plan to enable Khulna Cable Shilpa Sangstha to release fibre optic cables to the market by December 2010 at a reasonable price," said Hasanul Huq Inu MP, the head of the committee. He said other plans included reaching low-cost laptop computers and solar panels to the public, particularly to students and the rural population. Inu said the technology to manufacture laptops would, however, come from abroad. "It will be possible to market digital land sets for Tk 500-600," he said. Inu said the production-oriented plan would breathe life into the moribund state-owned telecom entities. "These organisations are facing losses, which is why the decision was made to manufacture land phones, mobile sets, laptops and fibre optic cable rather than the old copper wire," he said. Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Ltd (BTCL) and other government entities including Teletalk have been directed to have their goods manufactured in domestic factories, he said. "These measures should make it possible to meet 25 percent of local demand in the sector, as well as earning foreign exchange," said Inu. Inu, head of JSD, a ruling alliance party, said the past interim administration and BNP-led government had crippled Teletalk: "The present government will transform it into a premier organisation." bdne
