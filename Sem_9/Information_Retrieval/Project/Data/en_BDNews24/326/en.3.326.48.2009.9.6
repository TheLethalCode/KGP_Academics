 NEW YORK, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fans embraced a new darling at the US Open on Saturday, showering 17-year-old American Melanie Oudin with encouragement and affection after her three-set upset win over 2006 champion Maria Sharapova "I thought it was fantastic," Roopram Ramharack of Long Island told Reuters in the National Tennis Centre plaza where thousands of fans gathered to watch Saturday's third-round match on a giant TV screen.

How she would come out fearless and ready to play, Oudin kind of reminded me of that." "I think New York fans are phenomenal," said Tim Lo of Toronto. "It was packed, completely packed out here.
