 Dhaka, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com)The apparel exporters have asked the government for a Tk 30 billion (3,000 crore incentive package to pay workers wages and Eid festival allowances even though the readymade garment sector achieved four percent export growth in last fiscal year. Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers' and Exporters' Association president Abdus Salam Murshedi launched the demand from a news conference on Thursday. "With the Eid-ul-Fitr approaching, BGMEA has to cater for a 5,000 crore taka (Tk 50 billion) incentive package to give away to the sectoral employees and workers before the festival," said Murshedi. Of the package, BGMEA wants the government to ladle out Tk 3,000 crore (30 billion) in assistance by Sep 7, he added. Murshedi said: "This is required as 40 percent of the 1,500 garment factory owners attending our general meeting admitted that they wouldn't be able to pay their workers salaries and Eid bonuses because business has been rather bad." He claimed that there was a 15-20 percent cut in the first two months' exports this year compared with last year and that's why many factory owners cannot pay their workers duly. BGMEA leaders have often been pressing the government from time to time for incentives, clamouring all through that their business suffered losses due to global economic crunch. The exports data, however, do not reflect any negative impact of global recession. According to Export Promotion Bureau statistics, in FY 2008-9 Bangladesh exported woven products worth $ 5.9 billion, which surpassed the export target, set by the sector, by 4.13 percent and 14.54 percent more compared with that for 2007-8. Bangladesh exported knitwear worth $ 6.4 billion in FY 2008-9 which fell short of its target by 2.35 percent, but compared with the preceding year, it was 16.21 percent more. Murshedi also demanded an additional Tk 10 benefit per dollar during exchange on 30 percent of the total export costs, minimum five percent subsidy on the interests accrued on the debts in the RMG sector and Tk 10 per litre of diesel until power and gas supply situations improved. He also claimed that 50,000 RMG workers have been laid off because of the closure of 107 factories forced by the global financial downturn. b
