 Dhaka, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com)--The committee to reform National University has submitted a report containing six recommendations to the education ministry, proposing changing the name of the university. University Grants Commission chairman professor Mohammed Nazrul Islam, the head of the committee, handed the report to education minister Nurul Islam Nahid on Thursday. The other committee members were also present. The committee recommended the name be changed to National Affiliating University. Prof Islam said they had made three main recommendations in the report. The report suggests formation of six or more regional centres in six divisions and bringing the colleges of the regions under the centres. The Dhaka divisional centre can be installed on the university's main campus located at Gazipur, the report said. The second recommendation says teachers' training course and other foundation courses can be held on the main campus like now. But the BA (pass or honours), M Phil, PhD programmes should not be operated there. The M Phil and PhD programmes are being operated by the university now. In the third recommendation, the committee stressed on curbing irregularities and corruption at the National University and legal actions against the perpetrators. The other recommendations include promoting the traditional and renowned government colleges in divisional towns to university based on particular standards and keeping the institutes of the university under the management of the main campus. The education minister told reporters the implementation would start soon on completion of some procedures. The report will be sent to the prime minister after she returns home and placed before the cabinet meeting for approval. The government formed the 11-member committee on March 25 to reform the university. b
