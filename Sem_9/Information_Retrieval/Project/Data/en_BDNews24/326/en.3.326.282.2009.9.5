<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com)Awami League acting general secretary Mahbub-ul Alam Hanif on Saturday asked factory owners to clear up wages and allowances to garment workers before Eid. He also claimed "conspiracies were going on" to create unrest in the garment sector, but he would not elaborate on the nature of the conspiracies and who might be behind them, as he addressed party activists in the party headquarters at Bangabandhu Avenue. His statement came two days after leaders of Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) said that many of the factories were unable to pay wages and salaries before Eid, as the sector had been pinched by the global economic crisis. It demanded assistance from the government, but finance minister AMA Muhith later turned down the plea. Hanif further said "ghosts" in the commerce ministry were obstructing the government's move to activate the state-owned Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB), which is responsible for creating competitiveness with private sector to keep prices of daily commodities under control. "Despite repeated directives by the prime minister, TCB could not be made fully effective due to obstruction by this group of people in the ministry," he said. Admitting that the government has failed to fully rein in price spirals, Hanif said: "The government is determined to bring prices of essentials under control". He also said anti-liberation elements, war criminals and murderers of Bangabandhu were trying to make the government unstable. bdnew
