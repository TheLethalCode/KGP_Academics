 Correction in paragraph six: Sunnydale School did not close because of swine flu concerns Dhaka, Sep 2 (bdnews24.com)Concern over the spread of swine flu is growing in educational institutions around the country, despite repeated government statements asking the public not to panic. "We're really scared because kids can't judge who is infected and who is not, but we are helpless until the schools are closed," Shahidul Huq, the father of a student at Sunnydale School, told bdnews24.com. Meanwhile, Dhaka University, the country's largest educational institution, is set to distribute information leaflets to students to raise awareness on the H1N1 influenza virus. DU pro-vice chancellor Prof Harun-or-Rashid told bdnews24.com the leaflets would be distributed soon. Prof Rashid said he was advising students to contact the university's medical centre if they felt feverish, while students displaying severe symptoms would be sent to other medical centres for treatment. One of the largest English medium schools in Dhaka, Scholastica, announced an "indefinite" closure recently in the wake of swine flu fears, although there was no government directive on school closures. The school reopened days later, but the move heightened concerns among teachers, students and parents throughout the country. Teachers' association leader Insan Ali said primary schools will start their vacations from Sep 8, while secondary schools would follow the normal academic calendar. On Tuesday, education minister Nurul Islam Nahid said the current situation did not warrant closing educational institutions, and there was no need to panic. The government confirmed the first H1N1 death in Bangladesh on Monday, after a 35-year-old woman succumbed to the virus on Sunday night. The World Health Organisation declared the swine flu pandemic on June 11. bdnews24.co
