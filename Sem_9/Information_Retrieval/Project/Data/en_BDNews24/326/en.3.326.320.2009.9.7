<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Sep 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Second seed Andy Murray blunted the big serve of American Taylor Dent to post a 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 victory to reach the fourth round of the US Open Sunday. The Scotsman allowed the hard-hitting Dent only two 145 mile-per-hour (233.3 kph) aces, getting everything else back into the court and taking advantage of his superior all-around skills to win in a brisk 90 minutes on a chilly night. Murray belted seven aces himself among 39 winners and faced only two break points in bringing the day seven program to a close. The 22-year-old Briton, runner-up last year to Roger Federer, will face 16th seed Marin Cilic of Croatia for a berth in the quarter-finals.
