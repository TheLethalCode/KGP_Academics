Inspector general of police Noor Mohammad, DMP police commissioner AKM Shahidul Haq and Nitol Niloy Group chairman Abdul Motlub Ahmmad attended among others.

Each car can enlist in the Ntrack system at TK 12000 with a monthly fee of TK 625. The service charge is expected to drop with more subscribers registering for the service.
