 Dhaka, Sep 1 (bdnews24.com)The government has formed an eight-member 'core group' to finalise preparations ahead of the World Trade Organisation's seventh ministerial conference in Geneva next November. The committee was formed at a meeting presided by commerce minister Faruq Khan at the Secretariat on Tuesday, and is scheduled to submit its report to the ministry by Sept 25. "Bangladesh will try and negotiate duty-free access for local goods to developed economies at the upcoming meet," Amitabh Chakrabarty, director general of the commerce ministry's WTO-cell, told reporters after the meeting. The sixth WTO ministerial conference in 2005 mandated 97 percent of goods exported from least developed countries (LDCs) qualify for duty free access to developed markets. However, most Bangladeshi exports, including readymade garments, leather products and frozen foods, failed to qualify for the initiative's duty free status to rich nations. Chakrabarty said Bangladesh is negotiating with the wealthy countries, especially the US, to put all its exportable products into the 97 percent group. "If the US put textiles and readymade garments into the 3 percent list of dutiable products, Bangladesh will not get preferential benefits," he said. An LDC ministerial meeting will be held in Tanzania in October, ahead of the WTO meet from Nov 30 to Dec 2 in Geneva. Chairman of Bangladesh Tariff Commission Md Mozibur Rahman will head the committee, with Centre for Policy Dialogue executive director Md Mustafizur Rahman and FBCCI adviser Manzur Ahmed among other members. b
