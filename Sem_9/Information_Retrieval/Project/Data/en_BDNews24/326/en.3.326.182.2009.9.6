 JOHANNESBURG, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Strikers Samuel Eto'o and Didier Drogba scored as Cameroon revived their World Cup qualification hopes and Ivory Coast moved within one point of the finals on Saturday. Eto'o set up the first goal and netted the second as Cameroon scored twice in two minutes midway through the second half to beat Group A leaders Gabon 2-0 in Libreville on Saturday. Drogba scored twice to help the Ivorians overwhelm their closest rivals Burkina Faso 5-0 in Abidjan on Saturday in their Group E match. They now need a single point to advance to the finals for a second successive tournament.
