<TITLE> Residents attack REB office in Rangpur for better power supply </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Rangpur, Sep 1 (bdnews24.com) Hundreds of residents late on Monday attacked an office of the Rural Electrification Board (REB) to protest against frequent power outages at Paglapir in the district, police and witnesses said. The protesters demonstrated for hours when they broke doors and smashed windowpanes of the office, said Tofazzal Hossain, general manager of the local REB committee. The committee ensures electricity supply to the district's Gangachhara, Taraganj and some parts of Rangpur Sadar upazila. Residents complained that they suffer from frequent power cuts when they break their fast during sunset and perform tarabi prayers at night. Noor Alam, officer-in-charge of Kotwali Police Station, said they brought the situation under control while REB officials tried to convince the protesters that they had very little to do in improving the situation since they were getting less supply from the main grid now-a-days. Hossain said that they got barely one-third of the required electricity, and it was difficult for them to meet the demand of the residents. No case was filed. bdn
