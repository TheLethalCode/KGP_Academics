 Dhaka, Sep 2 (bdnews24.com)--The public prosecutor at Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court has recommended cancellation of a case against Khaleda Zia's elder son Tarique Rahman on Wednesday. Businessman Abu Shahed Shahel had filed Tk 4.89 crore extortion case against controversial businessman Gias Uddin Al Mamun with Gulshan Police Station on May 4, 2007. Tarique was shown arrested in the case after Mamun admitted the BNP leader's involvement in a confessional statement under 164 section, although Tarique was not named in the case statement by the complainant. Abdullah Abu, the prosecutor, told bdnews24.com on on Wednesday evening, "I recommended his exemption from the case." Tarique was released from prison a day shy of completing a year behind bars. Eleven cases were filed against him and 24 more cases against the family of Khaleda. A press briefing on Wednesday noon at BNP's Naya Paltan central office demanded withdrawal of all cases filed against Tarique. The government earlier decided to withdraw one case against BNP leader Moudud Ahmed. bdnew
