In a statement issued on Sunday, the Swedish Committee for Afghanistan (SCA) said soldiers had entered its hospital in Wardak, south of Kabul, on Wednesday evening without explanation and conducted a search, including of female wards and toilets.

When the soldiers left, hospital staff were told to report any potential insurgents they treated to the NATO forces, the Swedish group said. Fange said the SCA did not have to do so.
