 Dhaka, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com)The Small and Medium Enterprises Foundation has signed an agreement with International Finance Corporation to assess the pre-feasibility of setting up an industrial park comprising a cluster of small and medium industries. The agreement was signed at the SME Foundation office at Karwan Bazaar on Sunday. Syed Akhter Mahmud, senior programme manager, IFC-BICF and Mamtajuddin Ahmed, managing director, SME, signed the agreement. "Our aim is to bring in plastics, light engineering, electronics and electrical industries under one umbrella since they are so akin to one another. If they are so set up that they happen to be physically close to one another, these industries will enjoy enhanced technical and infrastructural benefits, offering products at reasonably more affordable prices," remarked Mamtazuddin Ahmed at the protocol signing ceremony. Most of the existing light engineering workshops are currently scattered in Dholai Khal area in Old Dhaka, who have of late been demanding establishment of an industrial park to enable all the above mentioned workshops and plants can be clustered together conveniently. SME and IFC had signed an MoU to this effect in January. b
