 Barguna, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com)A low in the Bay of Bengal causing two days of incessant rain has left at least 45 villages in Barguna district inundated under four feet of water, a WDB official said on Saturday. The areas were flooded when water levels in rain swollen Paira and Bishkhali rivers passed their danger marks, Abdul Majid Mollah, executive engineer of Barguna Water Development Board, told bdnews24.com. Mollah said the local WDB recorded 63 centimetres of rainfall in the 24 hours up to Saturday afternoon. Many houses located outside flood protection embankments in the area were inundated with two-to-four feet of water, while some villages inside the barriers were also affected due to damaged flood defences, said Mollah. Mollah said some flood protection embankments in the district had been weakened by Cyclone Aila in May this year. Seven villages in Barguna Sadar upazila have been inundated, five in Betagia, 11 in Patharghata, seven in Bamna and 15 in Amtali upazilas, he said. "The water has receded to some extent as a result of the natural ebb of the rivers," said the WDB official. Gazi Mahmud, a resident of Barguna Sadar upazila, told bdnews24.com over 200 families had sought shelter on the embankment's higher ground. Meanwhile, Golam Mostofa Chowdhury, president of Barguna District Trawler Owners Association, said over 500 trawlers returned to shore Saturday afternoon when waters in the Bay became turbulent. bd
