 Syed Nahas Pasha London, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com)Three Bangladeshis were charged with murder at Sheffield Magistrate Court on Tuesday after 23-year-old Safrajur Rahman Jahangir (Shaju) was shot dead in the northern city last week. Police believe Safrajur, also Bangladeshi, was deliberately lured to the spot where he was murdered in a planned hit. Safrajur, from the Darnall area of the city, was shot twice in the body. Police arrested three brothers Mohim Khan, 36, and his brothers Mukid, 33, and Munaim, 28 who have been charged with conspiracy to murder. Brother of Safrajur, Shahinoor told bdnews24.com, "Our family is devastated. He was kind and considerate to every one. It just doesn't seem believable that anyone would want to hurt him in any way." Safrajur owned the Spice Hut takeaway restaurant in Middlewood Road, Hillsborough. Detectives investigating the murder of the 23-year-old say a phone call was made to his business shortly before he was killed. They say a false takeaway order was placed and the killers were lying in wait for him when he arrived to make the delivery on Scraith Wood Drive, Shirecliffe. When Safrajur pulled up in his silver Vauxhall Corsa to deliver the food, he was shot twice at close range through the driver's side window in what police are describing as an "organised hit". Detective Superintendent Peter McGuinness, who is leading the murder investigation, said, "We believe that one gun was used and that Mr Jahangir was shot twice from close range." "He was either stationary at the time or going very slow. This wasn't a drive-by shooting, it was an organised hit where Mr Jahangir was lured to the street and aimed at." "This was a planned, targeted assassination of Mr Jahangir, in that he was lured to a spot and killed quite clinically." A paramedic and the driver of a bus, which Safrajur almost crashed his car into when he was hit, tried to resuscitate him. But the young man was pronounced dead at the scene. A post-mortem examination revealed he had died from two gunshot wounds to the body. Safrajur's brother told bdnews24.com, "He was constantly harassed by a group of Bangladeshi and Pakistani men. Last year he was beaten up and suffered serious injuries in an attack outside his takeaway business." Following the murder, police raided houses in different locations across city and arrested the three brothers Mohim Khan, of Handsworth Road, Mukid Khan, of Ribston Walk, and Munaim Khan, of Gainsford Road, in Sheffield.
