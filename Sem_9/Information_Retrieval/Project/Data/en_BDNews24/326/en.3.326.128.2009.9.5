 Syed Nahas Pasha London Sept 4 (bdnews24.com)The UK government has launched a new campaign to cut carbon emissions by 10 percent in 2010, targeting around 90,000 homes in some of the poorest areas in the UK and aiming to save them 20 percent on their fuel bills. That's an average of a 300 saving per year per household on fuel bills, while energy companies will spend 350 million over the next three years to deliver whole house, whole street energy makeovers. Energy and Climate Change Secretary Ed Miliband has welcomed the new campaign call 10:10. In the past year, more than 1.2 million homes have received some form of insulation under the Government Carbon Emissions Reduction Target with enough professional loft insulation installed to stretch from London to Sydney and back. The number of households getting this help through energy companies has been increased, with Government recently increasing the target by 20 percent. The Carbon Emission Reduction Target (CERT), an obligation on energy suppliers to promote household carbon reductions is operating at a higher level than ever before, with the target recently increased. In 2010 topping up a loft could contribute around 2 percent to a 10 percent saving. In 2010, government will start trialling "Pay As You Save". This is a new way of paying for whole house energy retrofits as part of our commitment to treat 7 million homes by 2020. All government departments have signed up to playing their part in achieving the world's first carbon budgets, which will set the UK on track to reaching its emissions cuts in 2020 and 2050. Each department is already taking steps to reduce emissions - for example, when the Home Office replaces its fleet cars it has committed to selecting the most efficient, and the Department of Culture, Media and Sport is using software which switches off computers during non-working hours. Energy and Climate Change Secretary Ed Miliband has said: "By signing up to the10:10 campaign, I hope people will be sending a broader message to governments round the world. They need to agree a global deal at Copenhagen that is ambitious in cutting emissions, fair to developing countries and effective in holding countries to their word." "We will cut emissions in the UK by at least a third by 2020. Concerted action shows the world we are serious about tackling climate change ahead of the crucial climate talks in Copenhagen."
