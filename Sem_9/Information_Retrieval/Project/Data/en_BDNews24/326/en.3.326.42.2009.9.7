 KARACHI, Sep 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Pakistan Test captain Wasim Bari has pledged to lobby for the return of international cricket to the troubled country after being appointed as the national cricket board's chief operating officer Monday. "My priority as COO is the promotion of cricket and also to work with the chairman (Ejaz Butt) on trying to convince the International Cricket Council and member boards to resume international cricket in Pakistan," Bari, 61, said. Pakistan became a no-go zone for international sporting events after seven Pakistanis were killed and six Sri Lanka cricket players were injured during an armed attack on their team bus as they travelled to a test match in Lahore in March. Bari, named COO after ex-Pakistan Test player Salim Altaf's sacking last week, was a wicketkeeper who played 81 Tests and 51 one-day internationals and also served as the country's chief selector at the last two World Cups in 2003 and 2007. He is stepping down as Pakistan Cricket Board director of human resources and takes up his new role immediately.
