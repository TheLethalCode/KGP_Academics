 Dhaka, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com)Foreign minister Dipu Moni left for New Delhi on Monday to have talks on all unresolved bilateral issues with Indian leaders. The minister flew by a Jet Airways flight at around 10:20am, an airport immigration official at Zia International Airport told bdnews24.com. Dipu Moni will meet her Indian counterpart SM Krishna on Tuesday, among other high officials. "We will discuss all unresolved bilateral issues including the huge trade gap and water-sharing issues on common rivers between the two countries," Dipu Moni told reporters on Sunday at her foreign ministry office after a meeting with Indian high commissioner Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty. "I will also meet the honourable prime minister, finance minister, energy minister and railway minister," she said. Chakravarty, who finalised the foreign minister's itinerary, said her expected appointment with leader of the Indian parliament Sonia Gandhi was yet to be fixed. He said the bilateral talks would also include transit issues between the neighbouring countries. India has been requesting both road and rail transit facilities to its under-developed north eastern states through Bangladesh territory for some time. Successive Bangladeshi administrations, however, have not provided India with the access due to the political sensitive nature of the issue. The foreign minister is scheduled to return to Bangladesh on Sept 10.
