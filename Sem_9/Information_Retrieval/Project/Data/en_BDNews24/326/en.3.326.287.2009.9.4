<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Sep 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Andy Roddick used a rocket serve and superior court coverage to romp to a 6-1, 6-4, 6-4 victory over Marc Gicquel of France to reach the third round of the US Open on Thursday. The fifth-seeded American boomed 13 aces past Gicquel, who sprayed 37 errors around Arthur Ashe Stadium to lose by the same score as his third-round defeat by Roddick at Roland Garros. Roddick faced only one break point in the match, which was in the final game, but he turned that away with a sizzling ace. Two points later an off-balance half-volley from Gicquel floated wide to end it. Roddick, whose 2003 triumph makes him the last Open winner other than Roger Federer, next faces compatriot John Isner, who earlier defeated Turkey's Marsel Ilhan in straight sets.
