<TITLE> Govt job quotas can't be withdrawn suddenly: law minister </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 5 (bdnews24.com)Law minister Shafique Ahmed said Saturday quota facilities for government jobs could not be removed all of a sudden. He, however, said the government would take steps so that talented people do not lose out because of the quota system. He made the statement at a discussion on 'Eliminating Quota System' as some participants said meritorious job-seekers were leaving the country being deprived of jobs here. Some of the participants voiced strong objections against the district-based quota system now in place for government jobs. The minister said he believed one day there would be no need at all of the quota facilities, "but for now it has relevance to some extent". "The system was introduced in line with the constitutional spirit," he said. The existing quota system, enacted in 1972, comprises 30 percent for freedom fighters and their children, 10 for women, 10 for district and 5 percent for the indigenous communities. The remaining 45 percent of government jobs are given on merit. The system was introduced to bring the deprived to forefront to create a balanced society while ensuring gender balance was also a priority. He said the district-based quota would be withdrawn gradually, and the special scope for the freedom fighters and their children might not last much longer. Proposals came up in the discussion that the government increase the percentage of merit-based places to 65 percent from the current 45 percent. Professor Abdul Mannan Chowdhury, vice chancellor of privately-owned World University, in his key-note paper said, "Intellect has been devalued by the quota system." He said the district-based quota facilities should go immediately, the sooner the better. bdnews
