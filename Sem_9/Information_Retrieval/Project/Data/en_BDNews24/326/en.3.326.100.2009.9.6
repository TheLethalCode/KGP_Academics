 Barisal, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com)  Road communication between Barisal and the rest of the country remained suspended on Sunday after transport workers and owners called an indefinite strike following the seizure of a bus. The strike suspended communication between Barisal and Dhaka, Madaripur, Babuganj, Mirganj, Banaripara and Swarupkathi. Barisal Transport Workers' Union president and Metropolitan Sramik League convener Aftab Ahmed told bdnews24.com on Sunday that police had seized two buses on Saturday on allegation that they did not have route permit. But the buses had route permit, Ahmed claimed. "We have called the strike against the illegal seizure," he added. Nathullabad Bus Owners' Association general secretary Alamgir Hossain said they would continue with their strike until there is a satisfactory resolution of the dispute over the illegal seizure. Barisal Metropolitan Police acting commissioner Abdur Rahim said the buses did not have any route permit while they were confiscated. They could not show any documents till Saturday night though they claimed that they had valid papers, he said. bd
