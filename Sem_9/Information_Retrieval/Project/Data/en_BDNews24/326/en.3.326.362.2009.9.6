 Dhaka, Sep 6 (bdnews24.com)  Leader of the opposition and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia will appear before court for proceedings of the Zia Orphanage Trust case, her lawyer said Sunday. Khaleda failed to appear before the court twice before as scheduled, on Aug 12 and 30, with her lawyers citing security reasons. The court on Aug 30 moved the proceedings to Sept 7 (Monday) in response to defence counsel's plea. It ordered six accused, including Khaleda and her son Tarique Rahman, to appear in the court Monday. Miah said Tarique would not be able to appear since he is currently residing in London. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case on July 3 last year, accusing Khaleda and five others of embezzling funds of the Trust worth Tk 2.10 crore. The ACC pressed charges in the case on Aug 6. bd
