 Barisal, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com)--Road communication between Barisal and the rest of the country resumed on Monday after transport workers and owners called off their indefinite strike after two buses had been seized. The bus workers and owners had called an indefinite strike in protest at the seizure of two Babuganj-bound buses from Notun Bazar by police on Saturday on allegations that they did not have route permit. The organisations claimed that the buses had route permit. Barisal Metropolitan Police's acting commissioner Abdur Rahim told bdnews24.com they held a meeting with Bus Owners' Association and Transport Workers' Union on Sunday midnight. The meeting decided that buses would be operating on all routes including Notun Bazar and Babuganj but would have to show route permit after the Eid-ul-Fitr, Rahim said. Barisal Transport Workers' Union president and Metropolitan Sramik League convener Aftab Ahmed said they had called off strike after the meeting. Police also released the buses, he said. bdn
