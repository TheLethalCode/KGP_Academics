<TITLE> Broaden climate change fight: WCC3, UN </TITLE>

 GENEVA, Sep 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The world should widen the fight against global warming beyond curbing CO2 emissions, the UN Environment Programme said on Friday as climate talks in Geneva established a Global Framework for Climate Services to strengthen availability and application of science-based climate prediction and services. The World Climate Conference-3 in Switzerland, which brought together more than 2000 climate scientists, sectoral experts and decision-makers from Aug 31 to Sept 4, adopted the global framework in its high-level segment on Thursday. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina, in her address to the high-level segment, also stressed the need for adaptation funds and transfer of green technologies for developing countries to combat the threat of climate change. She backed the proposal for a World Climate Services System, but said the system would only work with international support and alongside funding for climate change adaptations. The prime minister said Bangladesh is eager to collaborate with the world community, in the areas of mitigation, adaptation, financing, investment, and transfer of technology for facing the threat of climate change on mankind. But, mentioning the threat of rising sea-levels, she said the challenge to countries like Bangladesh in facing natural disasters from global warming and climate change is "monumental". "It is clear all must acknowledge their sacred duty to save our climate system, and hence our planet as a habitable place for future generations," Hasina said. UN's Ban fears sea rise UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, in his address on Thursday, also warned of the threat of rising seas, saying inaction could spell a rise in seas levels of up to 2 meters (6.5 ft) by 2100. "By the end of this century, sea levels may rise between half a meter and two meters," he said. That would threaten small island states like Mauritius, river deltas like Bangladesh and cities such as Tokyo, New Orleans or Shanghai, he said. His sea level projection is above the range of 18 to 59 cms (7-24 inches) given in 2007 by the UN's own panel of experts. Their estimates did not include the possibility of an accelerated melt of vast ice sheets in Antarctica or Greenland. Ban said greenhouse gas emissions, mainly from burning fossil fuels, were still rising fast. "Our foot is stuck on the accelerator and we are heading toward an abyss," he said. Climate Services Ban also welcomes the Climate Services initiative. "Scientific knowledge must be the basis for global climate policy, both for mitigation and adaptation to inevitable climate impacts," he said. "The Global Framework for Climate Services is an important step toward strengthening the application of climate science in local, regional, national and international decision-making." Michel Jarraud, secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization, which convened WCC-3 with partners including the UNEP, said, "The work to implement the Global Framework for Climate Services goes beyond WCC-3 and beyond climate negotiations in Copenhagen this December." "Society will need information tools to adapt as the climate will continue to be variable and to change notwithstanding steps taken to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases." The climate services pact has five essential components including a Global Climate Observing System, the World Climate Research Programme, and Climate Services Information Systems taking advantage of existing national and international arrangements. Curbing a string of pollutants Meanwhile, the UNEP has said the fight against global warming should be widened by curbing a string of pollutants other than carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas. Heat-trapping methane, nitrogen compounds, low-level ozone and soot are responsible for almost half of the man-made emissions stoking climate change in the 21st century. A wider assault on pollutants, twinned with cuts in carbon dioxide, would help toward a new UN climate pact due to be agreed in Copenhagen in December and have other benefits such as improving human health, raising crop yields and protecting forests. "The science is showing us that global warming is happening faster and on a greater scale than anticipated," UNEP executive director Achim Steiner told Reuters on the sidelines of the WWC-3 in Geneva. "There are other avenues by which we can move forward" than cutting carbon dioxide, the main focus of a planned new UN climate deal to be agreed in Copenhagen in December. Soot or 'black carbon', for instance, is among air pollutants blamed for killing between 1.6 and 1.8 million people a year, many from respiratory diseases. Ozone, a component of smog often linked to emissions of fossil fuels, has been blamed for loss of billions of dollars worth of crops. Nitrogen compounds, from sources such as sewage and inefficient use of fertilizers, stoke global warming and can cause "dead zones" in the oceans that cut fish stocks. And methane, which comes from sources such as deforestation and livestock, contributes up to 20 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions. "We believe that those involved in the negotiations (on a new climate pact) should broaden their field of vision," Joseph Alcamo, UNEP chief scientist, told a news conference. "It's not just a matter of carbon dioxide and energy." Many of the non-carbon dioxide pollutants are not regulated by international treaties.
