 Dhaka, Sep 4 (bdnews24.com)Two young Bangladeshi mountaineers are set for an expedition to climb the Cho Oyu peak of the Himalayas, which they believe would inspire the country's youth to be adventurous. "Our aim is to spread the spirit of adventure among the young generation," M A Mohit, leader of the team, told bdnews24.com on Friday at the flag-off ceremony, where they were handed the nation's flag to be hoisted at the sixth tallest peak of the Himalayas. "Not only climbing mountains but all sorts of adventures would keep the young generation away from all the harmful elements," he said, referring to the problems drug addiction and violence. Mohit, joined by Tareq Onu who has climbed the Mont Blanc, the highest mountain in the Alps and is the first Bangladeshi to be at the North Pole, are scheduled to leave for Kathmandu on Sep 7. Their forty-day long expedition would start from Nepal's Zangmu at the Tibet border, according to Mohit, who climbed four Himalayan peaks over 20,000 feet recently. At the ceremony and news conference organised by Bangla Mountaineering and Trekking Club (BMTC) at National Press Club, the organisers said the natural wonders of the world are more like "public property" and every nation should claim their right over them through expeditions. "Every mountain is open to all and anyone can go over therethis mission would claim the nation's right over it," BTMC founder Enam Ul Haque said. Haque said the club has already 12 expeditions in five years since inception. "We are grateful to Transcom Beverages for being a partner since the beginning." Former caretaker government advisers Zillur Rahman Siddique and Akbar Ali Khan handed the flag, put together in an ice-axe, to the two mountaineers. Khan echoed Haque on the issue of "public property", and stressed on establishing every nation's "justified right over it". "Let these (mountains) not be the properties of powerful nations only." He referred to China and India's move to place hydro-electric plants on the Himalayas and said it was a grave threat to Bangladesh's existence. "I urge the government to take necessary diplomatic steps to prevent such anarchy." Onu gave a presentation on the planned expedition and said: "We are not just climbing it but we are going there to share the experience and joy of conquering the peak with you." The ceremony also heard from Siddique and G Q Chowdhury, executive director of Transcom Beverages.
