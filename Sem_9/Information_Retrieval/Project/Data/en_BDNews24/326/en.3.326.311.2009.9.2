 MUMBAI, India, Sep 2 (Reuters) - Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and in-form Sri Lankan batsman Tillakaratne Dilshan have each been nominated in three categories for this year's International Cricket Council (ICC) awards. Dhoni has an opportunity to pick up a second consecutive one-day international player of the year award, and also features in the cricketer and Test player categories in the list of nominations released by the sport's governing body on Wednesday. Dilshan has been named among the nominees for the cricketer, Test player and Twenty20 international performance of the year. The nominations were compiled by a five-man panel chaired by former West Indies captain Clive Lloyd with performances during the period from August 13, 2008 to August 24 this year taken into consideration, the ICC said. Awards will also be handed out to the emerging player, women's cricketer and umpire of the year, and will be presented in Johannesburg on October 1. The Test and ODI teams of the year will also be selected and an award to the team that has adhered most to the spirit of cricket will also be named.
