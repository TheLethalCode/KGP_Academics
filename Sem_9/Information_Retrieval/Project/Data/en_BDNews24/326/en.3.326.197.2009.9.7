 PERTH, Sep 7(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil prices fell below $68 a barrel on Monday on concerns that high unemployment in the United States, the world's top energy consumer, will weigh on demand.

US crude prices have been trading in a range between $65 to $75 a barrel since the start of August, with prices swinging on economic data as investors seek clues about the speed of a recovery from the recession. Traders will also be watching a weather disturbance which is moving westward from Africa. There is a medium chance of it becoming a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the US National Hurricane Center said on Sunday.
