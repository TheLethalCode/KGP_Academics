 Faruque Iqbal bdnews24.com Chittagong Bureau Chief Chittagong, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com)Container handling firm Esack Brothers has threatened to sue Chittagong Port Authority for Tk 200 crore in damages in case its cargo-handling deal at Chittagong Container Terminal is cancelled. Managing director Haji Mohammad Yunus spoke to bdnews24.com as the shipping ministry referred a case to the ACC this week accusing former shipping adviser MA Matin of irregularities in awarding Esack Bros the contract. According to a probe by the parliamentary standing committee on shipping, the contract was executed in a hurry during Matin's last 24 hours in office and illicitly awarded to Esack on Jan 6, as the present government was actually being sworn in. The standing committee report also said Esack Bros does not possess required experience to handle the work order. The shipping ministry referred the case with the probe findings to the Anticorruption Commission on Tuesday (Sept 1). Incumbent shipping minister Shajahan Khan has indicated that the ACC may bring charges against eight to nine persons including Matin in the coming week. Yunus told bdnews24.com: "If the CPA unjustly decides to deprive us of the CCT's container handling work order, we'll sue them claiming a minimum Tk 200 crore in compensation." Ahsanul Aziz Shelley, the executive director of the firm, said the same when he talked to bdnews24.com on Tuesday. Yunus insists the company secured the three-year contract through a proper tender process and "negative propaganda" against the company is causing both financial and reputation losses. "We would be compelled to go to a court of law if any decision goes against the company's interest, and Esack Brothers is deprived of the CCT contract." Rejecting the allegation of inexperience lodged against the company, Yunus said Esack Brothers was licensed by the CPA and the National Board of Revenue, and they have been efficiently handling containers since 2003. The firm handled 1,85,000 TEU containers in 2008, he added. Meanwhile, berth operator Everest Enterprise filed a Tk 25 crore compensation suit against Matin on Tuesday, also accusing the ex-adviser of irregularities in the CCT tender that caused Everest to lose the deal. Matin had cancelled a previous CCT bid on Nov 20, 2008 and floated a new tender on Dec 22. Everest was the lowest bidder in the original tender, quoting Tk 453 handling charges per container. In the second tender, Esack came out as the lowest bidder quoting Tk 340 per container. Matin awarded the contract to Esack and faxed a copy to the CPA chairman on Jan 6, the last day of caretaker government's tenure. No evidence was found, however, of any bribe involved the deal. A three-year contract was signed between the CPA and Esack Bros on Feb 2. Everest has called for cancellation of the second tender. Everest Enterprise chief Shahadat Hossain Selim has also demanded that a fresh tender should be floated. CPA officials said advice has been sought from the law ministry with respect to the efficacy of the agreement executed with Esack Bros, who was meant to take over at CCT last month. CPA chairman Commodore RU Ahmed told bdnews24.com that he would seek the ministry's clarification and direction with regard to a letter received about cancellation of Esack's contract and floating of a new tender. Authorities, meanwhile, have kept former operator Saif Power Tech on at the terminal. Saif, whose contract ran out on Aug 15, has been charging Tk 505 per container on an "interim basis", according to the shipping ministry. CCT sees a turnover of more than 2,000 containers daily. bdnews24.c
