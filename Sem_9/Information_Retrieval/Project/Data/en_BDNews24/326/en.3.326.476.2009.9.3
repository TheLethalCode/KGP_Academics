 Dhaka, Sep 3 (bdnews24.com)The Election Commission on Thursday served a show-cause notice on independent MP for Narail-1 Md Kabirul Haque, asking him to explain why he should not be stripped of parliamentary membership for running election while holding a public office of profit. Deputy secretary of the EC AKM Salimullah told bdnews24.com the notice was sent on Thursday asking for a reply within 10 days. "Kabirul Haque cannot continue as a member of parliament if he ran in the general election being the mayor of Kalia municipality in Narail." According to the Representation of People Order none holding a profitable post can contest in parliamentary elections. Election commissioner M Shakhawat Hossain on Aug 27 told bdnews24.com legal steps would be taken against all involved in violation of the RPO. The notice on Haque said as a mayor holding office of a "statutory public authority" he had been disqualified under the RPO to contest the parliamentary election. The EC on Monday served a similar notice on ruling Awami League MP for Jhenaidah-3 Shafiqul Azam Khan. Salimullah said another MP, of Jatiya Party, Begum Nasrin Jahan Ratna, who also held a mayoral post while running for parliamentary election, was not issued a notice yet as a case is still pending. The EC will take decisions immediately, he added. bdn
