 Dhaka, Sep 2 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka stocks finished upbeat Wednesday for the second straight day on an investor buying spree, which caused over 70 percent of issues to gain. The day's highs were largely driven by pharmaceutical and non-banking financial institutions (NBFIs), according to brokers. "NBFIs gained the most, on expectation of their capital base doubling," an official of brokerage house Royal Securities told bdnews24.com. The official, however, said the buying spree had followed depressed market prices. "Buying often occurs after a few days of losses to gain benefit from the low prices," said Salahuddin Ahmed Khan, a former CEO of Dhaka Stock Exchange. Salahuddin expressed doubt on the sustainability of the trend: "Market participation is dropping day-by-day, which is apparent from the declining turnover." He said a further fall in turnover is expected ahead of Eid: "Funds will probably be pulled for festival expenses." Meanwhile, pharmaceutical shares gained significantly, followed by mutual funds, although the bellwether, banks, ended mixed. Most insurers eroded Tuesday's gains, although some ended upbeat while fuel and power shares edged up and cement shares continued their rise. Dhaka Stock Exchange's benchmark index gained around 24 points to end on 2974.49, while turnover slipped to Tk 4.46 billion from Tuesday's Tk 4.99 billion.

Gainers outnumbered losers 172 to 58, with four issues holding steady. Latest entrant to the market, Navana CNG continued to top the turnover board, with shares of Tk 245.807 million traded, although it fell 4.71 percent to Tk 210.20 on profit taking. Off-dock service entity, Summit Alliance Port Ltd followed with a turnover of Tk 198.109 million, climbing 3.44 percent to Tk 2254.50. Beximco edged up 0.55 percent to Tk 287.40, with shares worth Tk 170.524 million changing hands.
