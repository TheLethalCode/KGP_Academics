 Dhaka, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com)  The activity of extremists in the southwestern zone is now "under control", RAB director general Hasan Mahmud Khandaker said on Thursday, but added that extortion and tender-grabbing were still the major crimes in the region. He said investigations were ongoing into who are directly involved and who are behind such crimes and why they are on the rise. "Those indirectly backing these crimes in the region are being identified. RAB has already intensified its operations to keep such crimes control," Khandaker told reporters at a views-exchange meeting at RAB headquarters. "Efforts are on to curb them," he said. Replying to a query, he said law enforcing agencies were for banning more extremist organisations. He also said coordinated efforts were ongoing to crackdown on religious militants. Earlier, director of RAB's media wing, Abul Kalam Azad, produced RAB's five-year statistics before the press. According to the RAB's figures, 557 people died in crossfire in 472 incidents between Mar 26, 2004 and Aug 31, 2008. RAB captured around 52,500 criminals in that time. Of them, 461 were militants. The elite crime-fighting force also recovered 6,000 illegal arms, around 53,000 rounds of ammunition. He said 624 RAB personnel were brought under various charges and penalised in the five-year period. Of them, 314 received major and 310 received minor sentences. The statistics also showed that RAB recovered 1,080,000 Yaba tablets, over 160 kilogrammes of heroin and 10,098,000 bottles of Phensidyl. RAB also earned the state around Tk 2 crore in fines during anti-adulteration drives, and realised around Tk 600 crore from companies on charges of illegal uses of VoIPs. b
