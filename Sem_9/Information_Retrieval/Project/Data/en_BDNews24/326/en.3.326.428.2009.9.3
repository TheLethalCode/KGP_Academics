 Dhaka, Sept 01 (bdnews24.com)Britain considers Bangladesh, one of the most vulnerable nations to climate change, as the "key" player among the Least Developed Countries for a fruitful outcome at the Copenhagen climate talks, the UK's visiting minister for energy and climate change, Ed Milliband, said Tuesday. His cabinet colleague, minister for international development Douglas Alexander, said a successful Copenhagen summit would also help Bangladesh mobilise more funds for climate change adaptation. Wrapping up their 24-hour visit to Bangladesh on Tuesday, both ministers acknowledged that developed countries should take the lead in reducing carbon emissions, the main cause of climate change. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina, meanwhile, headed for Switzerland the same morning to attend the World Climate Conference-3, accompanied by foreign minister Dipu Moni and state minister for environment Hasan Mahmud. Mahmud told reporters before departure that Bangladesh would demand compensation from the counties responsible for climate change. Alexander told reporters at a press conference at Hotel Radisson before leaving Dhaka, "Bangladesh can claim more funds for climate change adaptation after the successful completion of the Copenhagen summit (in December)." "Bangladesh is at the frontline of the climate vulnerable countries." He said the UK had backed its commitment in providing climate change adaptation funds to Bangladesh and would continue to do so. "After the Copenhagen summit, more sources of funds can be collected from other donors," said Alexander. The minister's comment came against the backdrop of the Bangladesh government's lack of success so far to mobilise further funds for a multi-donor trust fund to support climate change adaptation in Bangladesh. Created by a joint Bangladesh-UK initiative in September last year, the UK is the only country to make a contribution so far of 75 million. Many countries have pledged contributions, but none have materialised so far. "Given its vulnerability to climate change, we see Bangladesh as a key partner amongst the LDCs to help deliver a successful outcome in Copenhagen in December," said Ed Milliband. Milliband said developed countries must take responsibility for global warming, but the developing nations should also play their role by creating low-carbon emitting economies. The two ministers visited a DFID-funded project on a river island to witness the impact of climate change on some of the most vulnerable inhabitants of Bangladesh. Terming Bangladeshis "resilient" Alexander said, "Bangladesh's efforts to adapt to, and reduce the impact of, climate change offer lessons to the rest of the world". Bangladesh last week finalised a draft of a comprehensive Climate Change Strategy Action Plan, with 44 separate initiatives under six themes, that has been recognised as one of the first such initiatives by any country. Planning minister AK Khondker heads a cabinet committee tasked with oversight of the climate change plan, which is likely to cost in the region of Tk 30,000 crore over 30 years.
