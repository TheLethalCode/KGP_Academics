 Dhaka, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com)The third session of parliament that began on Monday will run through to Sept 15, according to a decision of the Business Advisory Committee of parliament. The council sat in a meeting headed by the speaker just before the session opened at 11 am. The meeting decided that the parliament will be in session starting at 11am to continue through 2pm. The third parliamentary session began after the council meeting ended. The MPs of the main opposition BNP along with Jama'at-e-Islami and Bangladesh Jatiya Party are absenting. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina, parliamentary deputy leader Sajeda Chowdhury, MPs Tofail Ahmed, Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, law minister Shafiq Ahmed, deputy speaker Shawkat Ali, parliamentary chief whip Abdus Shaheed, opposition representative Jamiruddin Sircar, Rahmat Ali, MP and Rashed Khan Menon of Workers' Party were present in the meeting of the BAC. No opposition Main opposition BNP was absent on the first day and most likely to maintain its long absence that began in the inaugural session. Opposition chief whip Jainal Abdin Farrouque said on Sunday that since they were observing a three-day mourning programme, that began Sunday, following the death of veteran BNP leader M Saifur Rahman, they would not join the House on the first day of the session. He said they would hold a meeting with opposition MPs and make a decision after the mourning programme that ends on Tuesday. The ruling coalition headed by the Awami League has taken no move to bring the opposition back to the House. Chief whip Abdus Shahid said to bdnews24.com on Sunday morning when asked if the treasury was making an effort to bring the BNP back: "What initiative should we take to bring them back to the House?" He said the BNP should come to parliament first and then raise their demands. "People have voted them to come to parliament. Their boycott is really unfortunate," he said. The BNP started staying off parliament from Jan 28, the second day of the first session, over a seating arrangement dispute with the ruling coalition. The ruling coalition reduced the BNP's frontline seats to four from eight. Outgoing speaker Jamiruddin Sircar, now a BNP MP elected from a seat vacated by opposition chief Khaleda Zia, gave the main opposition nine seats without the consent of the Awami League. The BNP MPs returned to the House on Feb 23 as Speaker Abdul Hamid assured them of allocating 'respectable' number of seats on the front row in the second session. Hamid agreed to give the BNP one more seat in the front row while it demanded three. The BNP stayed away from the second and budget session over the dispute.
