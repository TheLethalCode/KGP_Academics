 Dhaka, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com) -- The government has moved up close to 500 senior civil servants in one mass promotion. The establishment ministry issued the order on Monday. Among the 494 promotees, 271 senior assistant secretaries were made deputy secretary, 163 deputy secretaries were elevated to joint secretary and 60 were made additional secretary from joint secretary. Officials who were overlooked for promotion in the past mostly made up the list, , Khurshed Alam Chowdhury, the ministry's joint secretary (appointment, posting and deputation), told bdnews24.com. Chowdhury said officials of ninth and tenth BCS batches were given priority for elevation to deputy secretary from senior assistant secretary. The list also shone spotlight on those of previous batches who had also been left in the cold, he said. The promoted officials have been asked to join as officers on special duty (OSD) at the establishment ministry. This is one of the biggest mass promotions in the civil service's history, in particular the first promotion by the present administration of so many senior assistant secretaries to deputy secretary. The coalition government headed by the Awami League has previously promoted a number deputy secretaries to joint secretaries and additional secretaries to secretaries in several phases. But before Monday, it elevated only two senior assistant secretaries to deputy secretaries. Those two officials were made additional secretary and joint secretary in the space of four months. The Superior Selection Board made the list in August after meetings in phases with the "deprived officials" following widespread discontent. The list was sent to prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who herself oversees the crucial ministry, for approval and she took several days to scrutinise the list. She approved the list before leaving the country to join the World Climate Conference-3 in Geneva on Sept 1. And, the decision came into force, a day after her return . bdne
