 Abdur Rahim Harmachchi bdnews 24.com. senior correspondent Dhaka, Sep 1 (bdnews24.com)The central bank has established a Tk 500 crore fund for collateral free loans to sharecroppers in the country, the first of its kind in Bangladesh, to be distributed through BRAC. Under the initiative, BRAC, the country's largest NGO, will borrow from the refinancing scheme at 5 percent interest and distribute collateral free loans to sharecroppers at 10 percent interest. "For the first time in the history of Bangladesh a fund has been created for sharecroppers which will play an immense role in development of agriculture," Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman told bdnews24.com ahead of the deal signing ceremony. The governor and BRAC chairman Fazle Hasan Abed were set to ink the deal on Wednesday. Atiur said sharecroppers historically had little access to loan facilities as they usually had little or no collateral to guarantee their debt. A number of NGOs applied to take part in the scheme, but BRAC was selected on the workability of their application, a BB official told bdnews24.com. The central bank earlier asked all government, private, specialised and overseas banks to assist in distributing Tk 11,500 crore in agricultural loans during FY 2008-09, of which over TK 9,000 crore has been disbursed to date. bd
