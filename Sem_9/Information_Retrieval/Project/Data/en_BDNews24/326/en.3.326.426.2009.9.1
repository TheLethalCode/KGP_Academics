 Liton Haider bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Sep 1 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Chhatra League activists have again been accused of manipulating a lucrative tender in the capital, just a day after prime minister Sheikh Hasina expressed concern over such allegations. Members of BCL, a student body associated with the ruling Awami League, were accused of fixing a tender process on Tuesday for procurement of furniture worth Tk 1.10 crore for the National Institute of Ophthalmology in the capital. They reportedly barred Navana Furniture from submitting its bidding papers while tender documents of furniture giant Otobi Ltd went missing from the tender box, said bidders and bystanders. Officials of Navana Furniture said they failed to submit their tender documents despite repeated attempts, as a group of youths introducing themselves as "Chhatra League" stopped them. On the other hand, an official of Otobi Ltd said they submitted their tender documents in the morning, but when the box was opened they found that their sealed packet was not inside. Project director of the institute Md Rezanur Rahman, however, told bdnews24.com that only three companies among five aspirants finally submitted their documents on Tuesday, the deadline for joining the bidding. He said Otobi and Navana had bought schedule papers, but Partex, Jhalak Enterprise and Babel Corporation participated in the final bidding. The tender-fixing allegation against BCL comes less than 24 hours after words of concern from Sheikh Hasina in the wake of widespread media reports of "tender terror" by AL's one-time student wing. She told a gathering of BCL leaders and activists in Dhaka on Monday that she was extremely upset to see the name of Chhatra League associated with "tender-grabbing" in newspapers. She was speaking at a discussion organised by BCL to conclude a month-long programme commemorating the Aug 15 death anniversary of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Navana's senior executive officer Parvez Hassan told bdnews24.com when some young men prevented him from submitting his tender papers on Tuesday, one of them identified himself as Sohel, saying he was the president of Mohammadpur thana Chhatra League. He said he couldn't tell the identity of the other men of the group who had been on the institute premises for hours. Chandan Kumar Biswas, junior executive officer of Otobi, told bdnews24.com they dropped their bidding papers off at around 9am. Biswas said their packet was large in size, so they faced trouble to drop it in the tender box. Later, the institute's accountant Rezaul Karim opened the lock of the box and put it inside. "But we didn't find the submitted tenders of Otobi when we opened the box in front of the tender committee and the participants," said the project director. Accountant Rezaul Karim told bdnews24.com that he put Otobi's tender papers inside the box. Then how did they go missing? Rezaul declined to comment further. Md Rezanur Rahman, the project director, said he had no idea about such a thing. Witnesses said the tender box, which was kept in front of the project director's room, went missing for 15-20 minutes. Later, it was returned to the original place. Both Otobi and Navana filed their complaints in writing to the tender committee. The project director said he would form a committee to look into the complaints. bdnew
