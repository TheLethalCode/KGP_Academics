 LONDON, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Frank Lampard penalty and a well-taken goal from in-form Jermain Defoe gave England a laboured 2-1 friendly win over Slovenia on Saturday in a warm-up for the home team's midweek World Cup qualifier against Croatia.

Defoe, who also scored both goals in a 2-2 draw with Netherlands last month, has scored seven for club and country in a superb start to the season. The last third of the match was played out at little more than walking pace before Ljubijankic gave the visitors a deserved consolation with his well-taken hea
