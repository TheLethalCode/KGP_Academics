<TITLE> Essential prices rising despite price control efforts: FBCCI </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com)  FBCCI president Annisul Huq has conceded that prices of some essential commodities have gone up despite the efforts by the government and business leaders to contain them. "The reason behind the price hike should be investigated," he told reporters after visiting Karwan Bazar wholesale kitchen market on Saturday. Huq, the chief of Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the apex business chamber, expressed his dissatisfaction as shops did not display price list in the market. "I have asked the traders about that, but they could not give me any proper reason," he said, adding that action should be taken against those who neglected their duties. He blamed delay in issuing delivery order for the sugar price hike. The price of sugar rose by Tk 2 per kg. Asked whether business leaders visiting the market would make any positive impact, Huq said: "As long as we are here prices are not increasing." Huq said he did not believe that reactivation of the state-run Trading Corporation of Bangladesh saw any major success. "But people might have derived some little benefit," he added. In the last few days, the price of lentil increased from Tk 3 to Tk 5 per kg; traders at Karwan Bazar blamed the retail market for such hikes.
