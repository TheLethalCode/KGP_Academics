<TITLE> Iran coverup allegations baseless, must stop: IAEA </TITLE>

 VIENNA , Sep 7, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The UN nuclear watchdog chief on Monday rejected Israeli and French suggestions that he has hidden information about Iran's atomic programme as groundless and said they should stop immediately. Mohamed ElBaradei delivered a rare public comment on the International Atomic Energy Agency's sensitive inspections work in response to allegations he has sat on "evidence" his critics say point to an Iranian drive to "weaponise" uranium enrichment. An Aug. 28 IAEA report said Western intelligence material implying Tehran secretly combined uranium processing, explosive tests and work to remodel a missile cone in a way that would fit a nuclear warhead was compelling. It said Iran must clarify the matter instead of just rejecting the intelligence as fabricated, without substantiating its denials. But the report contained no concrete evidence of an Iranian nuclear weapons agenda. In an address opening a meeting of the IAEA's 35-nation Board of Governors, ElBaradei said all information on its Iran investigations released so far had been vetted for substance and the agency would stick to that standard of objectivity. "I am dismayed by the allegations of some member states, which have been fed to the media, that information has been withheld from the Board. These allegations are politically motivated and totally baseless," he said. "Such attempts to influence the work of the (IAEA's non-proliferation inspectorate) and undermine its independence and objectivity are in violation of ... the IAEA Statute and should therefore cease forthwith." MORE INFORMATION French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said last week the IAEA had yet to publish annexes of findings on Iran which he said were "important" for an assessment of "possible military dimensions" to Iran's uranium enrichment campaign. Israel's Foreign Ministry has said the IAEA report "does not reflect" all the agency knew about Iran's "efforts to continue to pursue its military (nuclear) programme and its ongoing attempts at concealment and deception". Israel is Iran's arch-foe believed to harbour the Middle East's only nuclear arsenal. It has been lobbying six world powers to intensify efforts to stop Iran's nuclear activity -- by crippling sanctions or even last-resort military action. The West suspects Iran is pursuing the means to produce atomic bombs behind the facade of a civilian nuclear programme. Iran says it wants only electricity from uranium enrichment. ElBaradei said Iran last month complied with longstanding IAEA requests for tighter monitoring of its Natanz enrichment plant to help verify no diversions into nuclear weapons work. "On other issues relevant to Iran's nuclear programme, however, there is stalemate," he said, referring to Iran's withholding of design information on planned nuclear sites, the weaponisation probe and Iran's refusal to adopt an IAEA protocol permitting inspections ranging beyond declared nuclear sites. Iran has spurned UN demands to halt enrichment, drawing three rounds of moderate UN sanctions since 2006. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad declared on Monday Iran would continue uranium enrichment and never negotiate on its "obvious" rights to a sovereign nuclear energy sector. US President Barack Obama has given the Islamic Republic until later in September to take up a six-power offer of talks on trade benefits if it shelves enrichment, or face stiffer sanctions, something the major powers are likely to consider in talks at the United Nations later this mo
