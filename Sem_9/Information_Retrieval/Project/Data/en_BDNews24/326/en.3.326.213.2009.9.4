<TITLE> `Arrest known war criminals before trial' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 4 (bdnews24.com)A citizen's group campaigning to put alleged perpetrators of the 1971 war crimes on trial has asked the government to arrest some of the people branded war criminals before formally commissioning the trial. It also asked the government to roll out a roadmap on the trial process of war criminals by Sep 30. If the roadmap is not announced within that time they will join forces with social, cultural and political organisations to launch a movement, he added. "Arrest those immediately, who the countrymen know about, who had been directly involved or abetted in the killings, rapes and lootings," Kabir Chowdhury, president of the Ekatturer Ghatak Dalal Nirmul Committee, said on Friday. "Outside [the prison] they pose danger to the country, threat to the peace and stability," said Chowdhury in the first session of the emergency representatives' conference of the committee. A nine-point draft proposal was placed at the conference that included publication of the list of war criminals. Mohammad Golam Rabbani, Ajay Roy, Shahriar Kabir, Muntasir Mamun, Ferdousi Priyobhashini, Jeyad Al Malum, Shirin Banu Mitil, Syed Mahbubur Rashid, Salma Haque and Kazi Mukul were present at the conference held at the Supreme Court Bar auditorium in the capital. "I hope I will be able to see the trial of war criminals in my lifetime," said Rabbani. "The government is saying since April that the trial will start from the next day, next week but that next is yet to come," said Shahriar Kabir, acting president of the committee. "It is beyond me, why the work has not started after the prime minister said that the proposal was passed in parliament. Then is the ministry defying the prime minister?" "The government has no preparation against the propaganda of Jamaat-e-Islami. We offered our assistance but still the government is not interested. "Now we are left with no other option than waging a movement," Kabir added. Jamaat, the country's biggest religion-based political party, is accused by many of having opposed independence and complicity with the Pakistani army in killings, rapes and other atrocities. "I think the entire country is prepared for this trial, save Awami League. From the look of the house [the government has set for the tribunal to seat], it seems that the government has no plan to try the war criminals," said Muntasir Mamun. "They are doing ridiculous things. We want the trial to start at the old High Court building." Referring to AL and its rival BNP's ties with the war criminals, he said, "You have associated yourselves with the war criminals but we have not. We will have to see whether this ultimately proves to be stalling the trial." "We want the government to announce the names of the probe committee and the head of the prosecution and select a nice place for trial. But not the house on Abdul Gani Road," said Ajay Roy. He urged the leaders of the committee to arrange a convention in Dhaka after Eid, a congregation at the Central Shaheed Minar with renowned personalities and forming human chains in front of the parliament building to mount pressure on the government. The nine-point draft proposal include allocation of the old High Court building instead of the proposed house on the Abdul Gani Road to set up the tribunal and appointment of skilled, honest and pro-indepence people as tribunal judges, investigators and lawyers, regardless of their political identity. The proposals also include not inviting war criminals to any state function, not giving them visa to go abroad, closure of financial organisations run by them, re-introducing the constitution of 1972, forming commission and publishing white paper to investigate persecution of minority communities during the rule of 1996-2001 BNP-Jamaat government, the grenade attack on Aug 21, 2004 and 10-truck arms haul in Chittagong. The centre-left Awami League-led Grand Alliance government took the initiative to try the war criminals during the 1971 war of independence from Pakistan after assuming office in Jan. But the Committee and the Sector Commanders Forum -- an organisation of commanders of the nine-month bloody conflict -- have been critical of the procrastination in the trial process. Around 3 million people died during the 1971 war at the hands of the Pakistani army and local collaborators, official records say. b
