<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 7 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court on Monday accepted charges pressed by the ACC against former prime minister Khaleda Zia for allegedly embezzling over Tk 2 crore from Zia Orphanage Trust that existed only on paper. The court of Dhaka metropolitan special judge A N M Bashirullah set Oct 25 to frame charges against five other defendants including Khaleda's elder son Tarique Rahman. It issued arrest warrants against defendants Mominur Rahman, nephew of Khaleda, and former principal secretary Kamal Uddin Siddiqui who did not appear in court. The court also ordered authorities to submit report at the next hearing on whether the two fugitives were arrested. Khaleda, the opposition BNP chief, appeared before the court amid tight security at 1:25pm and the hearing on the acceptance of the charges began five minutes later. The court on Aug 30 set the Monday's hearing and directed the government to ensure security for Khaleda, a two-time former prime minister, to facilitate her court appearance. Other accused in the case are Khaleda's elders son Tarique Rahman, who is currently staying in London for medical treatment, former BNP MP Kazi Salimul Haque and Sharfuddin Ahmed. The Anticorruption Commission pressed charges in the court against Khaleda, Tarique and four others on Aug 5. A total of 36 people have been listed as state witnesses in the case, according to investigation officer Harun-or-Rashid. The Supreme Court in the first week of August upheld the previous High Court bail orders secured by both Khaleda and Tarique in the case filed with Ramna Police Station on July 3, 2008. 'No embezzelement, no due process' Khaleda's lawyers alleged that the government headed by Awami League did not cancel the case in an attempt to revenge itself on her, even though it had withdrawn many cases filed for political persecution. Advocate Khandaker Delwar Hossain, also the BNP secretary general, said proper process was not followed in pressing the charges in that approval was not taken from the proper authorities. He said there was no element of money embezzlement in the case. The money sent from abroad was not embezzled in the name of the trust. Land was bought in Bogra with the money, Hossain added at the hearing. Advocate Sanaullah Miah told the court that all 20 cases against the Zia family were filed plainly to politically persecute them. The government withdrawing such cases that were filed only against the AL leaders, he said. "The military-backed (caretaker) government sent Khaleda Zia to jail on Sept 3, 2007. The then government failed twice by trying to send her abroad," Miah said. "Khaleda told the government that she would not go anywhere leaving the country. "There is no legal reason to accept charges against Khaleda Zia, her elder son Tarique Rahman and four others," he said. Another counsel, barrister Rafiqul Islam Miah, said at the hearing that the case was filed to politically harass the defendants. He asked: "Why does Khaleda Zia have to be discriminated against if (prime minister) Sheikh Hasina gets cases against her withdrawn?" Barrister Jamiruddin Sircar presented legal explanations citing the grounds that buck a trial. Special public prosecutor Mosharraf Hossain Kajal refuted the contentions of the defence lawyers. "There are sufficient documentary evidence to take the case into cognisance. The defendants have embezzled money by bringing money from Saudi Arabia, with the scheme led by Tarique and Mominur," he said. "The Saudi government gave Tk 4.44 crore in assistance for the poor and orphan. Of the money, Tk 2.10 crore was channeled to Zia Orphanage Trust. But the money was not used for the orphans," Kajal said. Scores of counsels for Khaleda shouted in protest at the statement. Defence counsel Masud Ahmed Talukder told the judge that the prosecution was providing wrong information about the case. It cannot show any document on the assistance provided by the Saudi government. The Kuwait government gave the donation, he claimed. Kajal said: "I am not delivering any statement beyond the case record. I am submitting evidence before the court." The courtroom was teeming with crowd during the hearing. Security upped The government heightened security measures at the court premises ahead of the appearance. Senior officials of Dhaka Metropolitan Police were on guard around the court. Kajal, who also suggested measures, earlier told bdnews24.com that over 400 law-enforcers were present around the court to ensure Khaleda's security. The hearing was deferred twice on Aug 12 and 30 since Khaleda did not appear in the court on security reasons. b
