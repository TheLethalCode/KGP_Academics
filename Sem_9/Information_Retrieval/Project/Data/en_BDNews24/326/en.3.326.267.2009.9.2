 Dhaka, Sep 2 (bdnews24.com)  Three more senior lawyers opined against the possibility of trying the BDR mutineers under the Army Act 1952, with one speaking of withholding a judgment altogether on the president's reference on the trial of the Feb 25-26 mutiny, on the fifth day of proceedings on Wednesday. An 11-strong full Appellate Division bench, headed by chief justice MM Ruhul Amin, heard from amici curiae Mahmudul Islam, Rokanuddin Mahmud and Ajmalul Hossain, while Dr Kamal Hossain concluded his statement from the previous day. Ten amici curiae were appointed by the court to give opinions on the president's reference. Only two so far have spoken in favour of trial by Army Act. Six others have either been against army trial or against answering the reference as it may interfere with ongoing investigations. Another two have yet to give their statements to the court. Kamal Hossain said, on the second day of his submission, that the defendants would have to be classified based on their offences through investigation. "We want punishment for the criminals. But we do not want innocent BDR personnel punished," he said. Written submissions on the presidential reference were then presented on behalf of Mahmudul Islam and Ajmalul Hossain, who are currently abroad. Mahmudul's statement said trial of BDR members is not possible under the Army Act, and last February's incident could not be tried by notification with retrospective effect. Ajmalul Hossain's statement also said the provisions of the Army Act were not applicable for BDR members, nor could a notification have retrospective effect. Kamal Hossain had said the same the day before, as had Barrister Amir-Ul Islam. Barrister Rokanuddin Mahmud was not in favour of the reference itself. He said 57 army officers were killed in the BDR mutiny, more than were killed in the 1971 independence war and, therefore, the trial should be "exemplary". But, Mahmud said, the mutiny case was filed under the criminal code. He said investigation was ongoing, with charges yet to be pressed and if the court gave answer to the president's reference it could "tie the hands of investigators". Mentioning different examples in India and Pakistan's Supreme Court, he said the reference could be sent back. Amicus curiae AF Hassan Ariff just began his statement to the court, when the hearing adjourned for the day. ASM Mesbahuddin, one of the ten amice curiae is yet to deliver his opinion. Last week, advocate T H Khan had also spoken against trial under the Army Act, and against the reference itself, while barrister Rafique-Ul Huq and advocate Khandaker Mahbubuddin Ahmed said the border guards could be tried under military law by issuing notification under the Army Act, Section 5though Mahbubuddin also said there may be some question about the notification's retroactive effect. bd
