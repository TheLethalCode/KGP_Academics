<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 2 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh signed a credit agreement worth $ 130 million with the International Development Association (IDA) on Wednesday for the installation of affordable Solar Home Systems in rural areas to help to increase access to electricity. The project will purchase and distribute 10 million Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFL) in exchange for incandescent lamps in densely populated areas, where the replacement would reduce the peak demand of electricity by about 360 MW, said a joint statement. Only 40 percent of the population has access to electricity in Bangladesh, it added. The agreement was signed at the Economic Relations Division while Musharraf Hossain Bhuiyan, secretary of Economic Relations Division and Tahseen Sayed, World Bank acting country director, signed on behalf of the respective parties. While addressing Sayed said, "The conventional power grid will not be adequate to ensure access to electricity for all, especially for the people living in remote areas. This additional financing would help to light up 300,000 homes through solar home systems." The credit by IDA, a concessionary arm of the World Bank, is provided as additional financing to the existing Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Development (RERED) project, which is functioning to connect consumers to the electricity grid, construction of distribution line, and providing Solar Home Systems since 2003. The credit has 40 years to maturity with a 10-year grace period carrying a service charge of 0.75 percent.
