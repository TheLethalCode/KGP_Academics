 CORRECTION to first para: Previous story mentioned 'link to ruling party', corrected to 'no direct link to ruling party' Dhaka, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary watchdog has observed that the law and order in the southwestern region has deteriorated in recent times but said they found no direct link of ruling party activists with the security slide, as alleged by some quarters. The home minister who attended the meeting of the parliamentary standing committee on home ministry on Thursday said that the government would not spare the ruling party leaders if associated with terrorism in the region, according to the committee chairman. "We have discussed the law and order in the southwestern region which recently saw a slide," Abdus Salam, the committee chairman, told reporters after the meeting at parliament building. "As per the reports of the inspector general of police and the Rapid Action Battalion, only the bandits are involved in the terrorism in the region." "They also informed us that there was no existence of political parties like Purba Banglar Communist Party or others. They are simply goons." The chairman, however, said there was an attempt to link the ruling party leaders with the law and order slide in the region. "The Awami League is a big party. There may be some bad people. But that does not mean that they will get away with it. "The home minister has told us that the government will not hesitate taking legal actions against the ruling party members if they are found guilty," said Salam, a retired major general. The committee's observations followed media report about the involvement of the ruling parties in crimes including snatching of tender documents.
