 Dhaka, Sep 3 (bdnews24.com) - The High Court on Thursday appointed three amici curiae for their opinion on the legality of forming a parliamentary probe committee to look into alleged corruption by former speaker Jamiruddin Sircar when he was in office in 2001-2008. A two-member panel of Justice Tariq Ul Hakim and Justice Boarhan Uddin appointed Rafique-ul Haque, M Zahir and Abdul Wadud Bhuiyan for their expert opinion involving a writ petition filed by Sircar seeking the higher court's intervention against the probe body. The court said it might appoint two more amici curiae, and the hearing is expected to be held next week. An 11-member parliamentary committee, headed by advocate Fazle Rabbi MP, submitted its report on July 5, with recommendations that Sircar's parliamentary membership be cancelled and actions be taken against him for misappropriation of parliament secretariat fund. It also observed that Sircar was involved in other unlawful practices during his seven-year term. The committee recommended that parliament ask him to refund the medical expenses worth Tk 27.86 lakh, and cancel appointments of third and fourth-class employees who were reportedly appointed without due process during Sircar's tenure. Challenging the legality of such a committee, its activities and recommendations Sircar filed the petition with the High Court on Aug 16. Sircar claimed his innocence. The BNP leader in his petition also prayed to the court to stay the proceedings and recommendations made by the probe body against him, saying its formation was not done following due processes of law. Speaker Abdul Hamid, probe body chief Fazle Rabbi Mia and 13 others were made respondents to the petition. Hamid formed the parliamentary probe committee in March. bdnew
