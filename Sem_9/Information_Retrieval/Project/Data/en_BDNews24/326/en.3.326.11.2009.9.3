<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Sep 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serena Williams beat Melinda Czink Wednesday to set up a US Open third-round grudge match with Maria Jose Martinez Sanchez, the Spaniard she accused of cheating at the French Open. Williams beat Martinez Sanchez 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 in the third round at Roland Garros in May but the left-hander from Barcelona won the opening set after scoring a break with a controversial shot that appeared to have bounced off her arm. Martinez Sanchez denied the ball had touched her body, leaving Williams furious. "The rules of tennis are when the ball hits your body, then it's out of play. You lose a point automatically. So the ball hit her body, and therefore, she should have lost the point instead of cheating," Williams said at the time. "I just have no respect for anybody who can't play a professional game and just be really professional out here." Wednesday, it was clear time had not changed Williams's take on the incident. "She was hit, yes," the 27-year-old told reporters, adding that she was looking forward to playing the Spaniard again on hardcourt at her home grand slam. "She's a tough cookie. She's aggressive," the second seed said. "It will be a good match. It's not on clay, so that will be interesting to see."
