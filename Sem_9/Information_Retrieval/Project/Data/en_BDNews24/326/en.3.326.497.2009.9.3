 Narayanganj, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com)Ministers Motia Chowdhury and Shamsul Huq Tuku said on Thursday that the government was looking into the "unwarranted" baton charge by police on protestors in the capital the previous day. At least 23 people, including Prof Anu Muhammad, of Jahangirnagar University's economics department, were injured after police charged demonstrators of citizens' action group, the national committee to protect oil, gas, mineral resources, power and ports. The group was attempting to besiege Petrobangla headquarters in protest against recent exploration deals with international companies. Agriculture minister Motia Chowdhury visited Anu Muhammad at Square Hospital in Dhaka on Thursday. Speaking to reporters after the visit, Chowdhury said Wednesday's incident was regrettable. She said an investigation was on to unearth what actually happened. State minister for home Tuku, replying to reporters' queries at a meeting of knitwear manufacturers in Narayanganj, also said, "The incident was unwarranted and the matter is being looked into with seriousness." Committee protests 'police attack' Meanwhile, members of the action group staged a rally in the capital denouncing what they termed the "police attack" the previous day. Thursday's rally was presided over by the committee's convener Sheikh Muhammad Shahidullah at the Muktangon premises. Shahidukkah told the gathering: "This protest will continue until peoples' demands are fulfilled. This protest is to achieve the rights of people. This protest cannot be stopped." He condemned Wednesday's police action, saying Prof Anu Muhammad was beaten in the streets "like an animal". "The incident was to take revenge," he added. Rashed Khan Menon MP also condemned the incident. "We achieved democracy after seven years of fight. An effort is on to destroy this democracy, which is an unforgivable crime." The the national committee to protect oil, gas, mineral resources, power and ports has announced another procession on Sept 10 to the prime minister's office if the government failed to cancel the offshore deals. bdnews24.c
