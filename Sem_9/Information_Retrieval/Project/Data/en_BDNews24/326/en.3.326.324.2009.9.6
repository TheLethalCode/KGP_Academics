<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 06 (bdnews24.com)Foreign minister Dipu Moni will fly to India on Monday morning to meet her Indian counterpart SM Krishna, among other high officials. "We will discuss all unresolved bilateral issues including the huge trade gap and water sharing issues on common rivers between the two countries," Dipu Moni told reporters on Sunday at her foreign ministry office after a meeting with Indian High Commissioner Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty. The foreign minister said she would meet her counterpart, SM Krishna, on Sept 8 to discuss bilateral issues. "I will also meet the honourable prime minister, finance minister, energy minister and railway minister," she said. Chakravarty, who finalised the foreign minister's itinerary, said Dipu Moni's expected appointment with leader of the Indian parliament Sonia Gandhi was yet to be fixed. He said the bilateral talks would also include transit issues between the neighbouring countries. India has been requesting both road and rail transit facilities to its under-developed north eastern states through Bangladesh territory for some time. Successive Bangladeshi administrations, however, have not provided India with the access due to the political sensitive nature of the issue. The foreign minister is scheduled to return to Bangladesh on Sept 10
