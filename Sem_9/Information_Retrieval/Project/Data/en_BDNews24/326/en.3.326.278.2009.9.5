 Dhaka, Sept 5 (bdnews24.com)-A young man infected with swine flu died in Dhaka on Friday, the second reported H1N1 fatality in Bangladesh. Dr Kazi Tariqul Islam, in charge of the ward earmarked for swine flu patients at Dhaka Medical College Hospital, told bdnews24.com that the victim was 20-year old Abdus Sobhan. The first H1N1 death in the country was reported by Lab Aid Hospital on Aug 30 as Mitali Chakravarty, a 35-year old woman from Savar. The death was confirmed as a swine flu fatality by IEDCR the next day. Sobhan was admitted to DMCH with a high fever and respiratory problems, tell-tale signs of the killer flu, on Friday, according to Dr Islam. He died later the same day. His body was taken back home in the early hours of Saturday. Father Mohammed Hanif Shikder said Sobhan, a stonemason, lived at Shekhertek in Mohammedpur in the capital. He had been suffering from high fever and breathing problems for the last three to four days, the father added. He said his son died at 9pm on Friday. The ward where the latest death took place now has four patients. The death raised the possibility of the country's alert level being raised from 2 to 3, signalling an epidemic. Meanhwile, a swine flu patient was admitted to Rajshahi Contagious Diseases Hospital on Friday, a doctor said, in a third case reported outside Dhaka. An air force officer and a doctor were the first confirmed swine flu cases, last week, in Chittagong and Sylhet respectively. At least 275 people have been detected with the virus, according to the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), the institute within the health ministry that is responsible for disease surveillance and outbreak response. Officials have said the virus was now being transmitted at higher rates within the country but there was no cause for panic. Experts have stressed the need for better dissemination of information about swine flu to ensure people in both urban and rural areas get proper treatment and take simple measures to curb the spread of the virus. Senior scientific officer of IEDCR Mushtuq Husain said there was no reason to fear. "We have been alert since the day WHO declared a pandemic." The first swine flu patient was detected in Mexico in April. The World Health Organization declared a global H1N1 flu pandemic on June 11. The first case was confirmed in Bangladesh on June 18. Health minister A F M Ruhul Haq has said the country is prepared to deal with the situation. The government has sufficient stocks of flu drugswith almost 30 million doses of oseltamivir, commonly known by brand name Tamiflu, in stockwhile doctors are receiving specialised training on a rolling basis throughout the country. IEDCR advises schools and offices to grant leave to anyone who displays symptoms of the flu. bdnews24
