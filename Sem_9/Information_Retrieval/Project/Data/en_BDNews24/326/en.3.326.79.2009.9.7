The court on Aug 30 set the Monday's hearing and directed the government to ensure security for Khaleda, a two-time former prime minister, to facilitate her court appearance. Other accused in the case are Khaleda's elders son Tarique Rahman, who is currently staying in London for medical treatment, former BNP MP Kazi Salimul Haque, Sharfuddin Ahmed, Mominur Rahman, a nephew of Khaleda, and former principal secretary at the prime minister's office Kamal Uddin Siddiqui.
