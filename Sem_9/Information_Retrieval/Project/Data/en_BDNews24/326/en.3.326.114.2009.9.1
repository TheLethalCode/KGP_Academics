<TITLE> CPA asks private sector to build multi-storey car depot </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Sept 1 (bdnews24.com)Chittagong Port Authority has shelved plans to build its own multi-storey car park for imported vehicles and invited private sector operators to establish a dedicated depot outside the port area. "The CPA will encourage any enterprise, especially Bangladesh Reconditioned Vehicle Importers and Dealers Association (BARVIDA), to come forward on the initiative," CPA chairman Commodore RU Ahmed told bdnews24.com on Monday. Commodore Ahmed said a multi-level building was necessary to keep ever-increasing numbers of imported vehicles under a single roof. BARVIDA general secretary Mahbubul Haque Chowdhury Babar, however, sounded cautious on the proposal, telling bdnews24.com the issue would be raised at their next meeting. "We have been demanding a multi-storey car park for imported vehicles for a long time, and a meeting last February ended in CPA agreeing to build a car park with its own money," said Babar. He said the plan was wholly conceived by the CPA, although BARVIDA supported the initiative and lobbied the government to implement it. "It would benefit both the CPA and the importers," said Babar. Babar said vital land would be freed by construction of the car park, while a single structure would reduce manpower required to guard the vehicles. CPA secretary Syed Farhad Uddin Ahmad said an extension to the port yard had created sufficient space to store imported vehicles, while importers could also clear their vehicles at Mongla Port. "Nevertheless, an inland depot for vehicles built with private sector funds would be helpful, and the CPA would extend help if BARVIDA volunteered to implement it," said Ahmad. But the BARVIDA general secretary said a ship carrying 575 cars was now idling in the outer anchorage for lack of space at the port. "A multi-level car park with a 4 to 5,000 capacity is very much needed," said Babar. b
