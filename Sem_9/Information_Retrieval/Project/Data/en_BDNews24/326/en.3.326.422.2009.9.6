<TITLE> War crimes trial roadmap likely this month: Shafique </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 6 (bdnews24.com)Law minister Shafique Ahmed on Sunday said the war crimes trial process may start before the deadline of a citizen's group campaigning to put alleged perpetrators of the 1971 war crimes on trial. Ekatturer Ghatak Dalal Nirmul Committee on Sept 4 asked the government to roll out a roadmap on the trial process of war criminals by Sep 30 and arrest some of the people branded war criminals before formally commissioning the trial. "The trial process may start before September 30. But the date for formally commissioning the trial will be finalised after completion of the investigation," the minister told reporters at the secretariat. Ahmed said, "We are repeatedly saying that the government is very keen on bringing the war-time criminals to trial and the necessary preparation have been completed." There should be no doubt over the start of the trial, he asserted. The government would proceed further on getting some logistic support it needed for holding the trial, he added. "We have sent letter to the public works ministry to fix a court building, as we would need space to sit the investigation team and the judges. We will appoint judges and a prosecution team after getting the place right." The law minister once again said that the government was under no pressure to ditch the planned trial for crimes committed during the 1971 war of independence from Pakistan. The government plans to put in the dock Bangladeshis who face charges of committing murders, rapes, arsons and looting and abetting the Pakistani occupation army during the bloody nine-month war. Ahmed said no political party or personality will be put on trial for political vengeance. The citizen group threatening to launch a movement against the government if it fails to start the trial process within the deadline, placed a nine-point charter of demand about the trial including publication of the list of war criminals. The Awami League-led alliance government took initiatives to try the war criminals after storming to power in January. bdnews
