<TITLE> No extrajudicial killings occurring: Sahara </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com)--Home minister Sahara Khatun has said that the ongoing crackdown on outlaws and extremists in the southwest is based on a list prepared by the law-enforcement agencies. "The law-enforcers are carrying out the clampdown as the extremists and terrorists regrouped in the south-western region," the minister told reporters at the Secretariat. She claimed that no extra-judicial killing was taking place during the swoop. "Those who are getting killed are dying in gun battles with the police and RAB." "Will the law-enforcers take bullets trying to detain the extremists?" she snapped at reporters. "The outlaws, terrorists and militants should be nabbed and they (the law enforcers) will take any measure for that," the minister said. Security has deteriorated in recent times in the region, which was a 'death valley' a few years back, with a number of murders taking place. Eight people died in the alleged gunfights with police and RAB in last two weeks. Two people were killed on Sunday morning in Kushtia and Faridpur in so-called 'gun battles' with the police and RAB. Sahara hinted that another list was going to be prepared. "The people linked to the outlawed parties should be listed." "They are changing their strategies. The law enforcers will have to change theirs as well," the minister said. Human-rights watchdog Odhikar said 19 people were killed in crossfire with RAB and police in August; most of them occurring in the southwestern region. Ten of the victims were activists of outlawed parties. The human-rights organisations have long been asking the government to stop the killings terming them extra judicial. RAB on Thursday said as many as 577 people were killed in 'crossfire' in 472 incidents until Aug 31 since the formation of the elite force on March 26, 2004. The High Court on June 29 asked the government to explain why killing without trial in so-called crossfire or encounter will not be declared illegal, and why departmental and criminal actions should not be taken against those who perpetrate such killings in custody and outside. The shooting incidents are commonly reported as 'crossfire' in the media, a term which has come to imply 'suspicious' or extra-judicial killings. Most recently, controversy was sparked when two polytechnic students were killed in RAB 'crossfire' in the capital in early June. Former state minister for home Tanjim Ahmed had said the RAB had launched a departmental investigation into the death of the two students. According to rights group Odhikar, 322 people were killed during the last two years of the caretaker government led by Fakhruddin Ahmed in "crossfire". Prime minister Sheikh Hasina herself announced in February that the extrajudicial killings perpetrated during the tenure of the military-installed interim government would be investigated. International and local rights groups, including Amnesty International, US-based Human Rights Watch, Transparency International, Bangladesh and Odhikar, over past decades have frequently expressed concern over the rate of extra-judicial killings in the country. HRW, in May, in a damning report, suggested 'elite' security forces such as Rapid Action Battalion and the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) be disbanded. bd
