 Dhaka, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com)Over a hundred people who had taken the 28th BCS written examinations demonstrated in front of the Public Service Commission office on Thursday alleging lack of transparency in publishing the results. Hafiz Al Asad, a demonstrator picketing the PSC office since 9am, said to bdnews24.com, "The results published lack transparency. Names of many brilliant and meritorious students are missing." "We are genuinely unhappy to have not found our names on the lists. The PSC officials refused to cooperate when we approached them to enquire about the provision of submitting application to obtain mark-sheet after depositing specific fees," said another agitator, Nihar Ranjan Das. The protesters tried to prevent PSC chairman Dr Sa'dat Husain from entering his office at 11:45am. Police escorted him along with two protesters into the office later, assistant sub-inspector Masud Sheikh of Kafrul Police Station told bdnews24.com. Arun Chowhan and AHM Manzoor Uddin, the two representatives of the demonstrators, told reporters after coming out of the PSC, "We've been assured that the provision and procedure for obtaining the mark-sheets will be notified in newspapers." "We've also handed over a list of the examinees who want to obtain their mark-sheets to the PSC officials." The results of the written exams were out on Wednesday. As many as 5,881 candidates passed the tests and will sit the oral exams likely to be held in October 4, Public Service Commission's public relations officer Mir Mosharraf Hossain told bdnews24.com. Of the successful candidates, 2,426 passed in general cadre, 1,593 in combined general and technical cadres, and 1,862 in technical cadres, Hossain said. Over 100,000 candidates took the 28th BCS preliminary exams against 1,720 posts on Nov 28 last year. The results were published on Feb 1. The written exams started on April 30 and ended in May. b
