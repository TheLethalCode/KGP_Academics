 Rajshahi, Sept 6 (bdnews24.com)Police arrested Islami Chhatra Shibir (ICS) leader Sabbir Ahmed Tafsir on Sunday night on charges of attacking and injuring policemen in Binodpur Bazar police camp near Rajshahi University on May 23 and sent him to jail on Monday. Tafsir, also the literary secretary of pro-Jamaat-e-Islami organisation's Rajshahi University unit, was picked up by Motihar police from Binodpur Bazaar at around 10pm. Police also arrested Ekram Ali, president of Sayyid Amir Ali Hall unit of ICS, on the same charges on Sunday. "Tafsir was picked up by the police Sunday night on charges of assaulting and injuring policemen on May 23 at Binodpur police camp," Motihar police chief Tofazzal Hossain told reporters. "He was sent to jail this morning through the court." Tofazzal said on May 23, a huge number of ICS activists along with outsiders brought out a procession in Binodpur when police intervened. The armed ICS members and outsider hooligans clashed with the police and swooped on Binodpur police camp, which left at least 20 people, including 10 policemen injured, he said. The Motihar police chief and Binodpur police camp in-charge filed two separate cases with Motihar Police Station against the Shibir leaders and activists. Following a bloody clash between the BCL and ICS activists on March 13, the university syndicate declared the campus closed for an indefinite period. To avoid any further unpleasant incidents, the university authorities banned meetings and processions on May 12 in line with a a syndicate decision. The ICS elements, however, decided to flout the prohibition and took out procession again with a huge number of outsiders on May 23. The clashes sparked when police tried to stop and dissuade them. bdnews2
