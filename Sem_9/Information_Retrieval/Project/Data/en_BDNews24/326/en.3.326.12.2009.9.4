 Mintu Chowdhury bdnews24.com correspondent Chittagong, Sep 4 (bdnews24.com)--Three water treatment projects at an estimated Tk 1200 crore undertaken by Chittagong WASA over the last one year have been in limbo, but authorities have moved to take another water supply project without fixing glitches in the previous ones. With Mohra water treatment plant and 78 deep tube-wells at its disposal, WASA currently meets only a third of the city's water demand, which may also stumble anytime, senior WASA officials have said. At present, WASA supplies only 19 crore litres against the daily needs of 54 crore litres. While bureaucratic delays, complications over land acquisition and litigations have put the three projects in trouble, Chittagong WASA has forwarded a proposal for setting up another Tk 600 crore water treatment plant at Bhandarjhuri under Boalkhali upazila. Officials said they are trying to push the three hanging water treatment projectsMohra 2, Modunaghat and Rangunia. The projects were scheduled to be initiated in 2003, 2001 and 2005 respectively. But city residents are not happy about the new promises since such moves failed to get through in the past. About the new plant, officials say survey work has been done, and Korean International Co-operation Agency has developed its master plan and forwarded it to the local government ministry in May for approval. Officials say the proposal is presently lying with the Economic Relations Division (ERD) of the finance ministry. On the slow progress on installation of the previous treatment plants, Chittagong WASA chairman AKM Faizullah said they were trying to solve the city's water crisis, but expectation of an overnight change was not practical. The planned projects, he said, are expected to be implemented one by one over next two to three years. Faizullah said prime minister Sheikh Hasina is likely to inaugurate installation work of the Karnaphuli water treatment plant in Oct-Nov, as the land owners are getting paid now for acquisition of their land. Faizullah said water supply would be possible maybe in two years from the plant. Meanhwile, he said, the World Bank has shown interest in financing the Modunaghat project. WASA chief engineer Shafiqul Islam told bdnews24.com that they were failing to meet the growing demands of water in the city. Once commissioned, the three treatment plants should be supplying 30 crore litres of water everyday, the chairman said. Mentioning that water demand is rising everyday in the city, as the city is expanding, the chief engineer said. He said considering increaser of population, they want to install the new plant at Bhandarjhuri. Another 10 crore litres of water can be added to the city's supply lines once this project is installed, he said. WASA officials said Modunaghat project was initiated in 2001 but work stopped becaue of bureaucratic tangle, he said, adding nine crore litres of water can be supplied everyday from this plant. If implemented, Karanaphuli plant will yield 13 crore litres daily, he added. Mohra 2 project, which got stuck due to litigation filed by a bidder, may get a stay order clamped on it removed when WASA will move against it after Eid-ul fitr. bdnews24
