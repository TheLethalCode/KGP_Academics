 GLENDALE, Calif. Sep 4, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Michael Jackson was laid to rest on Thursday at a funeral attended by family and celebrities, more than two months after the pop star died at age 50 of a drug overdose that has been ruled a homicide. Tight security kept fans, reporters and even aircraft well away from the Forest Lawn cemetery in the Los Angeles suburb of Glendale, where Jackson will lie in the stellar company of such Hollywood icons as Walt Disney and Humphrey Bogart.

Those concerts were to have helped the singer pay off debts and shore up his finances. Police have said they will seek criminal charges in the case but so far officials have not filed any. But scandal was likely far from the minds of the Hollywood celebrities who attended the service, including actress Elizabeth Taylor, child star Macaulay Culkin and Jackson's ex-wife Lisa Marie Presley, daughter of Elvis Presley. Jackson's final resting place is a crypt in the Grand Mausoleum, a vast, mock-Renaissance building on the stately property. His body had been kept at the cemetery since his public memorial service at a basketball arena in downtown Los Angeles on July 6. The Jackson estate will reimburse the Glendale Police Department for its expenses, estimated at up to $150,000. The city of Los Angeles absorbed the estimated $1.4 million cost of the memorial serv
