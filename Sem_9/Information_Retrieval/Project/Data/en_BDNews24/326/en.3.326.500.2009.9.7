 KABUL, Sep 7, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Afghan journalist, sentenced to death for blasphemy, reduced to 20 years' jail on appeal, has been set free and is living in exile in an undisclosed country, a media watchdog said Monday. Perwiz Kambakhsh, 24, a reporter with the Afghan Jahan-e Now daily, was sentenced to death in January 2008 by a court in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif.

Karzai's office was not immediately available for comment. Earlier this year, RWB warned that press freedom in Afghanistan had become worse and threats against Afghan journalists had risen in recent years. Threats against Afghan journalists were mostly in the form of attacks or kidnappings by Taliban insurgents and criminal gangs.

"The Perwiz Kambakhsh affair will remain a judicial lapse marked by religious intolerance, ill treatment by police and incompetence by certain judges," said RWB Secretary General Jean-Francois Julliard in the statement released Monday.
