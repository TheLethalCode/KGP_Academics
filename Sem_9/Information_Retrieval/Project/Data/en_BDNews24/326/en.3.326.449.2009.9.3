 Jessore, Sept 3 (bdnews24.com)An alleged top criminal of the southwest and his brother were killed in a reported gunfight with RAB in Jessore early on Thursday. According to police, Ahsan Kabir Hassan, 42, was also the kingpin of a smuggling racket. There are 20 cases with different police stations against him, police said. Hassan was allegedly linked to journalist Shamsur Rahman killing and Jessore Udichi bomb blast. The other deceased was Mizanur Rahman Mizan, 38. RAB-6's lieutenant commander Tareq Aziz told reporters, on a tip-off that a group of arms traders had been meeting at Sharapole playground, a team of the elite force went to the spot at around 3:30am. The criminals opened fire on the team, forcing them to retaliate, Aziz said. Hassan and Mizan died on the spot during the gunfight while others fled the scene, he said. Twelve arms and huge ammunition were recovered from the spot, the RAB official said.
