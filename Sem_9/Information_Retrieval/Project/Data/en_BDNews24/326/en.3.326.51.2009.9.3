 Dhaka, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com)Officials at the communication ministry have said the government's mobile court drive to remove illegal vehicles from the capital's gridlocked roads has stalled, after just ten days, due to insufficient space to dump impounded vehicles. Only a handful of tens of thousands unfit vehicles have been taken off the roads so far, Shafique Alam Mehdi, convenor of the 12-member committee on traffic tasked with coordinating concerned government agencies, told bdnews24.com on Wednesday. "It's impossible to find space for seized vehicles, which is preventing the mobile courts from seizing more," Mehdi said.. The courts have seized just 23 vehicles, but have filed almost 700 cases, while around Tk 800,000 has been realised in fines since the drive kicked-off on Aug 23, according to the communication ministry. Mehdi said it was a drop in the ocean as an estimated 50,000 unfit vehicles remained on the capital's roads. He also said, "An agency with unilateral power is required to tackle the city's traffic jams; one body empowered to make decisions while overseeing concerned organisations." Fifteen mobile courts, under the direction of Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) and the Dhaka district authorities, have been operating in the city. However, of these, BRTA mobile courts seized all 23 vehicles, while district administration mobile courts had failed to remove a single unfit vehicle from the roads. Mehdi, an additional-secretary of the communications ministry, said the drive was specifically targeting vehicles more than 20-years-old in line with the law.
