 Dhaka, Sep 7 (bdnews24.com)--Growth of knitwear exports has suffered a setback because of global economic crisis while increasing pressure of price fall in global market may worsen the situation in coming months, a top leader of the sector said Sunday. The country exported knit items worth $6429.26 million in 2008-09 fiscal year, which accounted for 41.30 percent of the total exports, but export growth shrank. The sector had seen an average growth of 26.78 percent over the last 10 years. But in 2008-09 it was just 16.21 percent. The previous year it was 21.50 percent. Export growth in the first three months was 52.05 percent in the last fiscal year while the last nine months saw a growth of only 6.29 percent, said Mohammed Fazlul Hoque, president of Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BKMEA). Talking to bdnews24.com on Sunday, he painted a grim picture of the sector, but said it is possible to overcome the hurdle if they get assistance from the government. Hoque said price fall of knitwear in the global market is a burning issue. He said buyers from major importing nations such as Germany, United States, France, United Kingdom, Spain and Italy are putting pressure for price-cuts of the items they import from Bangladesh. Even buyers from Germany, which has topped the list of importers for Bangladesh knitwear since 2003-04, are looking for lower prices, Hoque said. He said it was difficult for them to lower the rates for various obstacles. "So we are getting fewer orders as a result." Just last month, the sector, despite setbacks, reported gaining third place in the global market for knitwear exports in 2008-09, leaving major competitor India behind. But, Hoque on Sunday described why they were unable to continue to fight with global competitors like India and China, to survive price falls. He said the absence of backward linkage industries and scarcity of raw materials such as raw cotton, dice chemical, machineries is the major constraint for the industry. "So we can't take orders at low rates, whereas India and China can since they have their own raw materials and low-cost machineries," he said. He said to remain afloat as a strong competitor Bangladeshi entrepreneurs need assistance from the government. "We have requested the government to support us with portion from the declared stimulus package meant for the affected industries," he said. The government has allocated Tk 5000 crore for export sectors in the current budget to offset losses stemmed from the global recession. He referred to the finance minister's comment that a decision is expected in mid-September when a meeting on issue will be held. Hoque said that smaller knit factories are facing serious trouble because they are unable to continue operations in the face of impacts of price fall. "Many of the factories have stopped operations," he said. Still, he said, the entrepreneurs are trying to continue the fight and looking for new markets. Japan, Hong Kong and South Africa are their major targets for that, he said. Meanwhile, the finance minister said on Sunday the government will sanction the major portion of a Tk 500 crore fund in cash support before Eid, the BKMEA president said. The fund, set aside for the knitwear sector in the budget, is often released late due to audit. "We've placed our export status, which has been on a slide since last September year due to the global recession, and asked the finance minister to sanction 70 percent of the fund from the budget immediately before Eid," Hoque said at a news conference at his office. It will help the knitwear manufacturers to easily meet the urgent needs ahead of Eid-ul-Fitr, he added, after meeting finance minister AMA Muhith at his office. "The minister took the matter seriously and assured us of taking quick steps," Hoque added. bd
