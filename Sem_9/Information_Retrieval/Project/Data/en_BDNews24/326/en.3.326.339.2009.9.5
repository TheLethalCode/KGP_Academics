<TITLE> Kan tipped as Japan national strategy minister </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Sep 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Naoto Kan, a former health minister, is likely to head the incoming Japanese government's planned new National Strategy Bureau, a powerful cabinet post that will oversee the budget process and set policy priorities, newspapers reported on Saturday. Prime minister-elect Yukio Hatoyama, who will take office on Sept. 16 following his Democratic Party's huge election win last Sunday, is also leaning toward picking Katsuya Okada as foreign minister, the papers said. Both Kan and Okada are former leaders of the Democrats and had been tipped as potential finance ministers. A 77-year-old former finance minister, Hirohisa Fujii, has also been tipped for the post. The appointment of the finance minister will also be in focus given concerns the Democrats' ambitious spending plans to put more money in the hands of consumers will inflate a public debt already about 170 percent of GDP, the highest among advanced countries. Hatoyama's choice for the top diplomatic portfolio is being closely watched after concerns emerged that his party's policy of adopting a more independent stance from the United States could damage ties with Tokyo's biggest security ally. Mainichi daily newspaper said Hatoyama picked Okada for his connections in the United States. The new National Strategy Bureau, to include both public and private sector officials, will be tasked with reforming what the Democrats have said is a cumbersome policy-making system in which the former ruling party, the Liberal Democrats, often had feuds between its numerous lawmakers pursuing vested interests and cabinet members. Kan's experience in tangling with bureaucrats when he exposed a scandal over tainted blood products at the health ministry could stand him in good stead. The new strategy bureau will seek to implement a Democrats' promise to bring elite bureaucrats to heel and put politicians back at the centre of policymaking
