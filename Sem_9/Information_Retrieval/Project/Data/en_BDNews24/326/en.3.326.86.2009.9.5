 URUMQI, China, Sep 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- Unrest in Urumqi, the capital of China's frontier Xinjiang region, is testing Chinese security forces as Han Chinese demonstrators impugn their loyalty, two months after deadly ethnic rioting on July 5. On Saturday, the city center was once again under heavy security and roads were blocked to cars after three days of protests this week. Troops used tear gas on two occasions on Friday to stop the crowds, after five people died in demonstrations on Thursday when crowds called for the regional party secretary to resign for not ensuring better security after a spate of syringe attacks. Han Chinese seeking to break into Uighur neighbourhoods or march on government offices called security forces "traitors" and "turncoats" for blocking their way, with older men often making emotional appeals directly to police and paramilitary troops to let them through. The unrest this week in Urumqi is unusual in that it is a sustained challenge by the Han Chinese who make up the majority of China's population. Security forces have been patrolling Uighur neighbourhoods since July, and occupied Tibetan areas for months in a show of force after demonstrations against Chinese rule in March 2008. "When they curse us, we feel wronged and heartbroken," a plainclothes military cameraman said on Friday. "We are also here to protect the people. Still, they ask why we are suppressing them when we didn't protect them on July 5." SYRINGE ATTACKS Four paramilitary armoured vehicles were removed from one intersection after Han Chinese crowds vociferously complained, but troops and police broke up crowds wherever they coalesced. On Thursday, crowds severely beat a Uighur man they accused of syringe attacks, and then attacked the ambulance that had tried to extract him from the crowd. It is not known whether any of Thursday's casualties died in that incident. Some of the units blockading roads in Urumqi, a city where most of the population is Han Chinese, used bullhorns to plead with the crowds for their understanding. "We understand and sympathize with you, but please cooperate in maintaining order and security in the city," one group announced to a crowd attempting to march to People's Square, site of the regional government. Most of the 197 people killed when Uighurs, a Muslim people with cultural ties to Central Asia, rioted on July 5 were Han Chinese. Han Chinese launched revenge attacks on Uighur neighbourhoods two days later. Uighurs in Urumqi complained of harassment by police and civilians alike, saying they are subject to regular harassment and have to carry additional identity cards. "Look at how the security forces are allowing the Chinese to protest. If a Uighur does anything at all, any Chinese citizen can call the police," said a Uighur man, Ali, who said he had been detained for 48 hours in late July. In the Uighur neighbourhoods behind the barricades, patrol groups stood watch with fixed bayonets. Han Chinese complained about the security measures. "On July 5, the Uighurs were allowed to rampage as they liked, but troops intervened with us before we were even allowed to do anything. They should at least let you kill someone and then arrest you," said a Chinese shopkeeper surnamed Du
