<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 2 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh will propose formation of a special compensation fund for the countries most vulnerable to impacts of climate change, foreign minister Dipu Moni has said ahead of Geneva climate talks. In an interview with German Deutsche Welle Bangla radio, aired on Wednesday, Dipu Moni said Bangladesh would press for implementation so that the demand for the fund is not confined to words only. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina and Dipu Moni flew to Geneva on Tuesday to attend the World Climate Conference-3a crucial gathering ahead of the UN climate summit in Copenhagen in Decemberto draw international attention to vulnerability of Bangladesh and other LDCs to impacts of climate change. Bangladesh, current chair of the LDC Group, and one of the countries on the frontline of climate change, has been described as a 'key player' in climate negotiations between rich and developing nations. The United Nations in a report has said $500 to 600 billion is required for a global fund to offset the possible impacts of global warming on vulnerable countries, and the money should come from rich nations. Dipu Moni said the Bangladesh delegation to Geneva, led by the prime minister, would place its position about possible future adaptation steps since Bangladesh stands among the most vulnerable countries to the impacts of global warming, including turbulent weather patterns and rising seas. She said they would also discuss how donor communities and rich nations can come forward with possible options in dealing with climate change impacts, which Bangladesh is already facing and will face in the future. She said the proposed global fund is very relevant for Bangladesh for its current and future "mitigation and adaptation" schemes, and added that British prime minister Gordon Brown has also talked of such a fund. She said only formation of a fund is not enough, rather rich nations must come forward to ensure technology transfer to vulnerable countries like Bangladesh. "We will prominently highlight these points with an argument that vulnerable countries including Bangladesh do need international cooperation," she said. Dipu Moni said Bangladesh will continue to press for such demands in all international conferences and discussions ahead of the Copenhagen summit slated for December. The conference in Geneva will formally begin on Thursday, and prime inister Sheikh Hasina is scheduled to address it on the first day
