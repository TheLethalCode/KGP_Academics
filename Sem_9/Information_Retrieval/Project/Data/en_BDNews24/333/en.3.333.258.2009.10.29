 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)Local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam has said they will take action against ruling Awami League men involved with tender terrorism, extortion and grabbing of property. "We have been speaking against them from the very beginning," he told reporters after the fourth cabinet committee meeting on law and order on Thursday. "There is a difference between political statement and government statement," said Ashraf, also Awami League general secretary. "If any person faces punishment he will also face political action as well. There will be no compromise here." Action has already been taken against the people involved with such activities, he claimed. Home minister Sahara Khatun, who also attended the meeting, said they had decided to take tough action against tender manipulation, extortion and property grabbing. The related ministries and firms have been asked to inform the local police stations on the day of tender submission and tender opening. Police will be deployed on the spot on that day, she said. "We have decided to involve police chiefs and superintendents of police with the tender process. We hope these steps will reduce tender manipulation." Nobody will be spared if found involved with tender terrorism, extortion and grabbing, the home minister said. b
