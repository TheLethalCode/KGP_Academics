<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com)Former BNP state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar was faced with remand Wednesday, in the Aug 21 2004 grenade blast case, only to be reprieved hours later as his lawyers succeeded in securing a stay on the remand order until Nov 1 on a High Court directive. The first additional chief metropolitan magistrate for Dhaka, Ehsanul Haque, had granted police five days remand to grill Babar, in connection with the 2004 grenade attack on an Awami League rally, as the accused was produced in the court at around 12.30pm. The BNP leader's lawyer Gazi Quamrul Islam immediately filed a petition with the High Court seeking an order for his client to be questioned at the jail gate. "Babar is now very sick. If he is taken into remand his life might be at risk," Islam told reporters after filing the petition. The High Court bench of justices Syed Mohammed Dastagir Hossain and Mohammed Roisuddin issued the order for police to question him at the jail gate. The High Court order was then submitted to metropolitan magistrate AKM Enamul Haque's court by another of Babar's lawyers Khandaker Mahbub Hossain. Haque set Nov 1 for another hearing and stayed the earlier remand order till then. Babar, already behind bars since March this year, serving 17 years on an arms conviction, was shown arrested in the grenade attack case on Monday. The grenade attack on the rally at Bangabandhu Avenue killed at least 23 people and left scores injured, including prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who was then opposition leader. Some 22 people stand charged in the cases, including former BNP state minister Abdus Salam Pintu, his brother Maolana Tajuddin, also the alleged grenade supplier, and Mufti Hannan, leader of banned Islamist outfit Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami. Of them, 13 accused including Pintu and Hannan are now behind bars while the remaining accused are on the run. The Criminal Investigation Department pressed charges in two cases, a murder case and an explosives case, on June 11 last year. Some 61 among 412 witnesses have so far testified. The witnesses include president Zillur Rahman, prime minister Sheikh Hasina, home minister Sahara Khatun and AL's former general secretary Abdul Jalil. bdnew
