<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com)For the first time, two parliamentary standing committees had a joint-meeting on Tuesday, to scrutinise a bill aimed at recovering outstanding loans from defaulters. The standing committees on law and finance met at the parliament building to discuss the Artha Rin Adalat (Money Loans Court) Bill 2009. Law minister Shafique Ahmed tabled the bill on 18 Feb, for an amendment to the 1990 law. It went, as is custom, to the parliamentary standing committee on law ministry for further examination. The amendment was initiated to realise outstanding loans from defaulters. Suranjit Sengupta, chairman of the committee on law ministry, told bdnews24.com after the meeting Tuesday, "This is a historic day in our parliamentary democracy." "We had a joint meeting with the parliamentary standing committee on the finance ministry and discussed the bill together." "We will sit again soon to finalise our joint recommendations so that a good law is passed," said Sengupta. As per parliamentary practices in Bangladesh, bills tabled in parliament go to the standing committee on respective ministries which move them. For instance, any bill piloted by the finance minister will go to the parliamentary standing committee on finance. But, parliamentary experts say, there are many bills which should also be examined by standing committees on other ministries.
