 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com)--A Dhaka court on Sunday granted the police three days to grill Safiullah Safu, who was arrested earlier in the day in connection with the bomb attack on ruling party MP Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh. Chief metropolitan magistrate Ehsanul Haque made the order after rejecting the 10-day appeal of Detective Branch of police. Safu is alleged to have links with both the Freedom Party and opposition BNP party. The Detective Branch arrested Safu from the capital's Segunbagicha area shortly after Saturday midnight, investigation officer in the case, Mohammed Akbar Hossain, told bdnews24.com. Since Wednesday's bomb attack, police have arrested four people, two of them relatives of convicts in the case regarding the assassination of independence leader 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The other two are the members of the Freedom Party, which was founded by another of the convicts in the case. "Safu had been an activist of the Freedom Party. At present he is involved with BNP," said Hossain. Advocate Mostafizur Rahman sought Safu's bail. He said: "Safu was implicated in the case as part of a conspiracy. He is not linked to the bomb attack. "Though it is said that he is an activist of Freedom party he is not a member at all. "There is an office of Bangladesh Krishak-Sramik Awami League in his house. His family members are members of BKSAL," he said. Safu's brother-in-law Khorshed Alam told bdnews24.com he had business of printing machinery in Purana Paltan. Safu is not a member of Freedom Party. His family members are involved with Awami League, Alam said. Taposh, also one of the lawyers advising the state in the appeals proceedings of the Sheikh Mujib's assassination case, was leaving his Motijheel office last Wednesday when his car was hit by a bomb blast. The young MP escaped unharmed, but 13 bystanders were injured in the explosion. Taposh, the ruling Awami League, including the prime minister, and police have said they believe the blast was an attack on the MP's life in an attempt to derail the final outcome of the long-stalled proceedings of the assassination case. They say family of those convicted instigated the bomb attack. On Saturday, DB arrested Khandakar Mehnaz Rashid, the daughter of fugitive death convict Lt Col (retd) Abdur Rashid. Police arrested Kamrul Haque Swapan, brother of Shariful Haque Dalim, another fugitive convict, on Thursday. They also arrested Freedom Party member Abdur Rahim. Investigators are now quizzing all three in remand. bdnew
