<TEXT>
 Barisal, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com)Students will be given school textbooks free of cost by December despite the huge damage the recent fire caused to the National Curriculum and Textboard Board, the education minister said on Wednesday. The government will take necessary steps to ensure maintenance of standards of higher education in the national institutions, Nurul Islam Nahid said at the inauguration of the 38th National Summer Athletics Meet 2009 at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Barisal. The present government is not for formulating the national education policy all by the Awami League adherents, the minister said. It would surely be finalised after consulting all the relevant quarters, he added. The minister said a certain quarter has been opposing the draft policy without even going through it; they are doing so just because they belong to the opposition. The minister urged the opposition to refrain from rejection and cooperate with the nation instead. Barisal mayor Shawkat Hossain Hiran also spoke at the meeting presided over by professor Mohammed Noman Ur Rashid, director general at the Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education. All education boards chairmen were present on the occasion. About 500 competitors from various national educational institutions will be taking part in the four-day swimming, football, kabadi and handball matches ending Oct 31. bdn
