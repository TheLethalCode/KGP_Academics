 Dhaka, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com)--Intern doctors at Sir Salimullah Medical College Hospital continued with their work abstention for the second day on on Monday following Saturday's factional clash of Bangladesh Chhatra League. The Out-Patient Department (OPD) opened at 8am. Intern Doctors' Association president Syed Ashraful Islam Rajib said they had opened OPD being concerned about the patients but they would not join work until they got proper justice. The hospital's director Brig Gen Khademul Insan Mohammed Iqbal told bdnews24.com: "The evening and night shifts are usually dependent on honourary and intern doctors. "Since they are now refraining from work we have asked the assistant registers, registers, residential doctors and indoor medical officers to provide service to patients." No intern doctors were available on Monday. Some honourary women doctors were seen at the labour ward on the fifth floor. Patient Firoza Begum, admitted at the women and children ward a week ago, said she was not getting treatment she used to since Sunday. At least 20 people were injured during the clashes on Saturday night. A number of rooms of the main student hostel were also ransacked. General students boycotted classes from Sunday claiming they were assaulted during Saturday's event. They were demonstrating on the campus demanding justice. A three-member committee was formed on Sunday to investigate the clashes. No classes were held on Monday though authorities gave no such declaration. College lecturer SM Shafiullah told bdnews24.com he went to the classroom but did not find any student there. Raquibul Islam Sujan, a second-year student, said they would not return to classrooms until they got justice. Students wore black badges on the campus condemning the incident and demanding justice and removal of vice principal Dr Saniul Alam Sadi. Prof MA Azhar told bdnews24.com the probe committee was working. He said they hoped the situation would become normal 'very soon'. Extra police were deployed on the campus after the clash. bdnews
