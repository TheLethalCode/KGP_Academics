 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)Foreign minister Dipu Moni has said Commonwealth reforms must meet the modern-day hopes and aspirations of its member nations and their citizens. "It needs to be a real platform representing two billion people," Dipu Moni told a discussion on Commonwealth reform, in the city on Thursday. Media Initiative for Public Policy organised the meeting ahead of the upcoming Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Trinidad and Tobago in late November. Dipu Moni called for making the international body more relevant in an age of globalisation. "It needs to be ensured that the Commonwealth reflects the interests and aspirations of the citizens of its member states," said the foreign minister. "And that it creates opportunities and opens networks for them whether in business, education, sport or politics." The Commonwealth is a voluntary association of 53 countries which were once part of the British empire. Former minister Mizanur Rahman Shelly moderated the meeting, addressed by former foreign secretary Shamsher Mobin Chowdhury, former ambassador Waliur Rahman, senior journalist Farid Hossain and Zaglul Ahmed Chowdhury. The British High Commission provided assistance for the meeting at the Hotel Razmoni Isha Kha in Dhaka.
