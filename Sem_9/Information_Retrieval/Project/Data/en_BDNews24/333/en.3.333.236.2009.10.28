 KABUL, Oct 27, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan forces exchanged gunfire with a group of militants holed up inside an international guest house in the center of Kabul on Wednesday, police said. The United Nations mission in Afghanistan said it was possible some of its staff and other foreigners were inside. Intense automatic weapons fire and an explosion resounded in the capital, and plumes of black smoke rose above buildings. A Reuters witness said a number of streets had been cordoned off by the police as the gunfire continued, and sirens reverberated across the city. "There are five or six terrorists inside," said Waheed Sadiqi, a policeman at the scene. An increasingly resurgent Taliban have vowed to stage attacks ahead of a second-round run-off in Afghanistan's presidential election on November 7. Eight US troops were killed in southern Afghanistan on Tuesday, the NATO-led alliance said, in the deadliest month for US forces since the start of the war eight years ago. The mounting violence comes as US President Barack Obama is weighing whether to send more soldiers to Afghanistan to fight a Taliban insurgency that is at its fiercest since 2001.

Ahmed Wali Karzai was quoted as denying the report and the CIA neither confirmed nor denied the reported payments. "No intelligence organization worth the name would ever entertain these kinds of allegations," a CIA spokesman told Reuters. The eight US soldiers killed in the bomb attacks on Tuesday pushed the October death toll to 53, topping the previous high of 51 deaths in August, Pentagon officials said. Efforts to stabilize Afghanistan have been complicated by weeks of political tension over an election in August marred by widespread fraud in favor of Karzai, forcing the second round vote. Karzai's camp said on Tuesday a run-off must take place even if his challenger, Abdullah Abdullah, quits the race. Karzai agreed last week to a run-off under severe international pressure after a U.N.-led fraud investigation annulled a large chunk of his votes in the original election. US soldiers now make up two-thirds of the 100,000-strong coalition force, with Obama considering proposals to send an extra 40,000 troops or a far smaller number. As part of his review of US strategy in Afghanistan, Obama is set to meet on Friday with Admiral Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the heads of the military services, the White House s
