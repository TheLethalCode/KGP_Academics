<TITLE> Nothing gained from threats: Ashraf to Khaleda </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com)Local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam, also general secretary and spokes person for ruling party Awami League, has said BNP had nothing to gain from "threats" against the government. Asked, he commented on opposition chief Khaleda Zia's recent statement that the government would be toppled by a people's movement and have to leave office before the end of its tenure. Ashraful said, "Her statement is non-democratic and treasonous. An elected government can only be changed through a vote of no-confidence in parliament." Khaleda had also spoken of a movement against the government following her BNP party's national council in December. "Awami League does not fear threats; (so) it's better not to give such threat. We are congenial enough to discuss all issues," Ashraf said at a news briefing at AL president's political office in Dhanmondi on Monday. "There are no gains from threat. We are determined to try the war criminals in the country, no matter how much hindrance may there be. No barrier, threat will be able to resist us. Law will take its own way." Ahsraful came down hard on Khaleda who on Saturday last, mocking the government's election pledge of 'charter for change', had said that the government intended to change the country's map. "We once have changed the map destroying her beloved Pakistan's map," he said. It was those who were against Bangladesh's existence and democracy that wanted to change the map, he said. Ashraful was speaking to the media after a meeting with the visiting all-party delegation of the UK. Philip Broom of Conservative Party, Nabila Sattar of Labour Party, Paul Speller of Liberal Democratic Party and Marina Narnor of Westminster Foundation, among others, attended the meeting from the visiting UK all-party delegation. bdnews2
