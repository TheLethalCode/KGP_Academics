 Dhaka, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com)--The country will fall into hands of killers if the ruling Awami League and prime minister Sheikh Hasina failed, a senior Awami League leader has apprehended. "Sheikh Hasina will not be let to fail. If she and Awami League fail, the country will go to the grips of the killers," AL leader and former home minister Mohammad Nasim said on Friday at a rally. The ruling AL's youth front Jubo League hosted the programme in front of the party's headquarters at Bangabandhu Avenue protesting the bomb attack on MP Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh. Pointing to home minister Sahara Khatun, Nasim said "Why are you not launching action? People want action and the government can not run without action." He vented his grievance over not arresting the police officers who made themselves controversial during four-party alliance government stint. "Why are the criminal police officers still at large? Why are they not being captured?" Nasim wanted to know why people such as BNP MP Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury, accused of war crimes, went not detained. Joint secretary Mahbub-Ul-Haque Hanif said, "We will not leave the street until the verdict of Bangabandhu murder case is implemented." "Those who killed the father of nation in 1975 have launched the attack on Taposh after being reunited," he said Taposh survived a bomb attack outside his office in the capital's Motijheel business district on Wednesday, which left at least 13 people wounded Chaired by acting chairman of Jubo League Omar Faruq, the rally was also addressed among others by state minister for local government Jahangir Kabir Nanak and whip of parliament Mirja Azam. bd
