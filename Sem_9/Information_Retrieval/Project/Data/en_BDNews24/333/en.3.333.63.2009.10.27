 Dhaka, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court has fixed Nov 30 for submission of the investigation report in an ACC money-laundering case against Tarique Rahman and business partner Giasuddin Al Mamun. Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Mohammad Abdur Rahim set the date after receiving the case files on Tuesday. Anticorruption Commission assistant director Mohammad Ibrahim filed the case with Cantonment Police Station the day before. Tarique and Mamun are accused of laundering Tk 20.4 crore (Tk 204 million) from Bangladesh by several routes to Singapore that violated the Money Laundering Act, Dhaka Cantonment police chief Hosne Ara Begum told bdnews24.com, quoting the case details. Ibrahim told bdnews24.com that Mamun received the money in exchange for awarding a work contract for a proposed 80MW power plant at Tongi. The amount was deposited to a Citi N.A. account in Singapore. "Tarique is also accused as he was also a beneficiary of the money," Ibrahim said. Mamun has previously been questioned by a special taskforce about the laundering during the past caretaker government. Later, the amount, transacted in Bangladeshi currency, was recovered by the government and deposited in the Sonali Bank, Ibrahim said. Tarique, elder son of former prime minister and leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia, is in London for medical treatment on bail from the Supreme Court. He already faces 14 graft cases against him. Mamun is currently behind bars in Bangladesh also facing a raft of corruption cases. bdn
