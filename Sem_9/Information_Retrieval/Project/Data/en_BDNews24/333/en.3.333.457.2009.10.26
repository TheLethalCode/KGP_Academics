 Reazul Bashar bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com)Exports have nosedived against targets in the first two months of the fiscal year compared with figures from the same period last fiscal, Export Promotion Bureau statistics show. The EPB figures indicate exports in the first two months fell by 6.86 percent against the target, 3.29 percent lower than exports in Jul-Aug 2008. This trend is likely to continue through incoming months, an expert on foreign trade has said, considering a 13 percent greater export earning target this fiscal. Zayed Bakht, BIDS research director, told bdnews24.com, "We happen to export most of our wares to Europe and the US, who are still trying hard to come out of the shadows of the all-encompassing recession." "The still conservative trends may cut our moderately ambitious export earning targets attainment through the first and second quarters." Md Shahabullah, EPB vice chairman, told bdnews24.com, "The last fiscal year saw a stupendous 60 percent export growth in July and another 42 percent in August juxtaposed with which the current year's earnings look dwarfed." "Escalation of export growth rates might occur at different times through years. Bangladesh is expected to do better towards the year-end in meeting the target." The overall export earning target in the last fiscal fell short in the end by 4.50 percent, EPB statistics revealed. As per the EPB figures, exports in all sub-sectorswoven, knit, textile fabrics and home textilesof the main sector of readymade garments have fallen. Processed food products, tea, leather and ceramic wares exports also nosedived. Chemical products, bicycles, computer software and services and handicrafts exports which shone last year have experienced cuts too. But exports of electronic equipment, jute goods, agro-basedespecially processed agricultural products including vegetables, tobacco etchave been augmented. The knitwear exports in Jul-Aug have bagged $1204.31 million, which fell short of the current year's target by 3.66 percent and 0.48 percent compared with the last year's earnings. During the same period, woven wear exports earned $1011.87 million, which fell short of the current year's target by 11.68 percent and 2.06 percent compared with the last year's earnings. FBCCI president Annisul Huq told bdnews24.com, "Usually, the first couple of months see export earnings escalating. But this year, the picture is different." "I'll say we have to exercise caution even if we refrain from raising an alarm reacting to this situation. "The overall exports and importsboth sectors have experienced cuts. Imports of raw materials and capital equipment have seen reductions. Foreign currency reserves have risen." Export of pharmaceutical products in Jul-Aug has fallen by 16.92 percent against the targets and by 37.15 percent compared with the earnings during the same period last year. Bicycle exports which registered a 31.52 percent growth last year have fallen. The sector this year experienced a cut in Jul-Aug by 15.77 percent and by 14.91 percent compared with the last year's figures. Export of frozen food products in Jul-Aug has fallen by 12.84 percent against the target and by 32.95 percent compared with the earnings during the same period last year. Export of tea in Jul-Aug fell by 80.09 percent against the target and by 82.88 percent compared with the earnings during the same period last year. Leather export in Jul-Aug has fallen by 24.26 percent against the target and by 22.33 percent compared with the earnings during the same period last year. Export of electronic products, however, in Jul-Aug went up by 119.23 percent against the target and by 83.87 percent compared with the earnings during the same period last year. Bakht said, "To offset any jolt to the national economy due to exports slump, we should have made efforts to bolster our domestic economy through encouraging enhanced private investments, which hasn't been done." "The export earnings constitute about 18 percent of the total GDP. Under the circumstances, a slump in the exports is likely to affect our overall economic wellbeing," he concluded. bdnews24
