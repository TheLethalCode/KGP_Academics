 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com)  The chief election commissioner on Sunday called for state funding of political parties, while conceding that parties would resist the move. "There is undoubted influence of black money and muscle power in the elections," said CEC ATM Shamsul Huda. "There is no alternative to state funding to bring transparency in the financing of political parties," he said at a TIB-organised discussion on 'Transparency in political finance'. "The subject can be discussed with political parties in the next round of dialogue," said Huda. But the election chief warned there would be resistance to the idea. "Political parties raise objections even to submission of audit reports." "It has to be kept in mind that political parties do not want to be under the thumb of the EC. But if the government finances them, the parties will be under the control of the commission." Nevertheless, there is plan to introduce state funding in the next election for campaign meetings, postering and party debates, he said. The Election Commission has had a poor record in the past of ensuring transparency and accountability in party spending for lack of adequate legal structures. The EC received support in this area through electoral law reforms under the past caretaker government ahead of the most recent 2008 national elections. But despite this, the commission suffered manpower shortage at the field level for monitoring party finances. Huda said, "The code of conduct was observed well in the last election. The EC will remain conscientious in applying the laws in the next election too." "But post-elections, we were not up to following up on breaches of the code." The CEC also added, "This government does not interfere with the commission activity in anyway." Others who spoke at the discussion, held at the BRAC Centre Inn, included Transparency International Bangladesh chairman M. Hafizuddin Khan, TIB executive director Dr Iftekharuzzaman, Rashed Begum Hira MP, and journalist Muhammad Jahangir. bd
