<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com)Main opposition BNP wants the Election Commission to declare Hafizuddin Ahmed elected for Bhola-3 constituency or hold fresh polls there involving the three eligible candidates, barring Awami League's Jasimuddin. "To us, by-election at Bhola-3 will be against justice and fair play. We would like to see major Hafiz declared MP from the seat," secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said at a news conference on Sunday. "Or, the Election Commission should hold fresh polls to be contested by the three candidates considered eligible by the EC then." Delwar's comments came three days after Hafiz, the BNP vice-president, himself called the EC to declare him winner. Asked what he would do if by-election is given, Delwar retorted, "The Election Commission is regulated by the Awami League that has failed to hold proper and unbiased election in the past." "No fair and proper polls have ever been held in the past nor any will be in the future." The High Court on Feb 26 declared Jasim's nomination unlawful after Hafiz filed a writ petition on Dec 17 to declare Jasim's nomination illegal. Jasim moved the Supreme Court on July 13 to overturn the verdict but the top court on Oct 18 upheld the HC ruling, leaving the Bhola-3 vacant. Jasim, a retired major, defeated his nearest rival Hafiz, another retired major, by nearly 14,000 votes in last year's general elections. The electoral law stipulates that none can contest the polls in three years from the date of retirement and in five years after compulsory retirement. Jasim went into compulsory retirement on Aug 3, 2004. The EC said Jasim's application was validated following the opinion of judge advocate general (JAG) Lt Col Mohammed Aziz Ahmed after the chief election commissioner sought opinion. The JAG told the EC that Jasim's retirement had not been a mandatory one. Alleging large scale administrative anomalies, Delwar said, "Newspapers published stories that 17 of the Grand Alliance polls candidates who eventually were elected MPs and appointed ministers, state ministers, whip etc had not submitted income tax returns during submission of nomination papers." "If the law had been strictly applied, all these 17 MPs would be declared ineligible to run the election. In that event, their opponent BNP contestants would win the polls easily." Delwar also criticised the way the prime minister and an election commissioner tried to defend Jasim's candidature. Hafiz said, "I demand justice. The court has made it evident today how we were defeated in the election." "BNP leaders and workers in Bhola-3 area have all along been persecuted and oppressed since months before the polls until today," he alleged at the news conference. Former speaker and now BNP MPJamiruddin Sircar, Barkatullah Bulu, joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan and Khaleda Zia's press secretary Maruf Kamal Khan Sohel were also present. b
