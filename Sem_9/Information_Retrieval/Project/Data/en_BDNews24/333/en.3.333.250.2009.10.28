 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com)BNP MP Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury secured temporary bail on Wednesday in another case that charges him with passing derogatory comments about the assassination of independence architect Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The High Court bench of justices AFM Abdur Rahman and Mohammad Imdadul Haque Azad granted Chowdhury six months' anticipatory bail and ruled on the government to explain within four weeks why he should not be given permanent bail. Chowdhury in a discussion at the National Press Club on Aug 13 this year had said that the Aug 15, 1975 killings of Sheikh Mujib and his family members were "inevitable". On Oct 20, Boda Upazila Bangabandhu Parishad general secretary Sheikh Abul Kashem filed the case against the controversial politician with the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court in Panchagarh. A total of five cases have so far been filed against the BNP MP in Tangail, Magura, Khulna, Thakurgaon and Narail on the same charges. He has secured bail in two more cases. There are allegations of Chowdhury's involvement in war crimes committed in 1971. The BNP leader, however, has so far been refuting all such allegations. bdnews2
