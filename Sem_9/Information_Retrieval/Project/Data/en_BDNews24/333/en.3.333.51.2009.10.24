<TEXT>
 Naogaon, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com)  Authorities imposed a Section 144 ban on public gatherings in Naogaon as Abdul Jalil was about to address an Awami League rally on Saturday, with AL associate organisation Swechchhasebak League calling a meeting at the same venue at the same time. Jalil, MP for Naogaon-5, was due to address the AL rally at 3pm but he had not reached there before the ban was imposed. Naogaon deputy commissioner Ahsan Habib Talukder told bdnews24.com: "Section 144 has been imposed on Naozowan ground and its surrounding area to avert any untoward situation as Awami League and Swechchasebak League both called meetings at the same spot at 3pm." No comments were available either from the local Awami League or Swechchhasebak League leaders. Jalil, earlier this month, was granted anticipatory bail from the High Court in a tax evasion case. The veteran politician has become a controversial figure within the ruling party, ousted from its higher ranks as well as being removed as the chair of a parliamentary standing committee, following outspoken comments about his own party and its leaders, including the prime minister, which sparked a political storm in recent weeks. bdnews
