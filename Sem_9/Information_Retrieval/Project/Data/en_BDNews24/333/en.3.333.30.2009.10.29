 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)--The Supreme Court has frozen a High Court directive that had stayed a metropolitan magistrate's order for remand of former BNP state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar in the Aug 21 2004 grenade blast case. The Appellate Division chamber judge, Justice Mohammed Mozammel Hossain, halted the order for seven days on Thursday, clearing the obstacle for the police to remand Babar in custody for questioning. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam said in the hearing: "The petition was filed in the High Court before the remand order was issued. That was a premature petition. "Lutfozzaman Babar was taken into remand earlier. He needs to be questioned for the sake of investigation of Aug 21 grenade attack case." Babar's lawyer Khandaker Mahbub Hossain said his client was seriously ill and his life might be at risk if he was remanded. Babar was faced with remand on Wednesday, only to be reprieved hours later as his lawyers succeeded in securing a stay on the remand order until Nov 1 from the High Court. The first additional chief metropolitan magistrate for Dhaka, A K M Ehsanul Haque, had granted the police five days to grill Babar when he was produced in the court at around 12.30pm. The BNP leader's lawyer Gazi Quamrul Islam immediately filed a petition with the High Court seeking an order for his client to be questioned at the jail gate. "Babar is now very sick. If he is taken into remand his life might be at risk," Islam had told reporters after filing the petition. The High Court bench of justices Syed Mohammed Dastagir Hossain and Mohammed Roisuddin issued the order for police to question him at the jail gate. The High Court order was then submitted to metropolitan magistrate Haque's court by another of Babar's lawyers Khandaker Mahbub Hossain. Haque set Nov 1 for another hearing and stayed the earlier remand order until then. Babar, already behind bars since March this year, serving 17 years on an arms conviction, was shown arrested in the grenade attack case on Monday. The grenade attack on the rally at Bangabandhu Avenue killed at least 23 people and left scores injured, including prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who was then opposition leader. Some 22 people stand charged in the cases, including former BNP state minister Abdus Salam Pintu, his brother Maolana Tajuddin, also the alleged grenade supplier, and Mufti Hannan, leader of banned Islamist outfit Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami. Of them, 13 accused including Pintu and Hannan are now behind bars while the remaining accused are on the run. The Criminal Investigation Department pressed charges in two cases, a murder case and an explosives case, on June 11 last year. Some 61 among 412 witnesses have so far testified. The witnesses include president Zillur Rahman, prime minister Sheikh Hasina, home minister Sahara Khatun and AL's former general secretary Abdul Jalil. b
