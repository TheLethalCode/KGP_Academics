 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com)  Detective Branch police made another arrest on Sunday in connection with the bomb attack on ruling party MP Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh. The arrestee is alleged to have links with both the Freedom Party and opposition party BNP. Detective Branch police arrested Safiullah Safu from the capital's Segunbagicha area shortly after Saturday midnight, investigation officer in the case, Md Akbar Hossain of the DB, told bdnews24.com. "Safu had been an activist of the Freedom Party. At present he is involved with BNP," said Hossain. Taposh, also one of the lawyers advising the state in the appeals proceedings of the Sheikh Mujibur Rahman assassination case, was leaving his Motijheel office last Wednesday when his car was hit by a bomb blast. The young MP escaped unharmed, but 13 bystanders were injured in the explosion. Taposh, the ruling party, including the prime minister, and police have said they believe the blast was an attack on the MP's life in an attempt to derail the final outcome of the long-stalled proceedings of the assassination case. They say family of those convicted instigated the bomb attack. Among those arrested in connection with last Wednesday's bomb attack, two are the relatives of the convicts in the Mujib assassination case and two are the members of the Freedom Party, which was founded by another of the convicts in the case. On Saturday, DB arrested Khandakar Mehnaz Rashid, the daughter of fugitive death convict Lt Col (retd) Abdur Rashid. On Thursday, police arrested Kamrul Haque Swapan, brother of Shariful Haque Dalim, another fugitive convict. They also arrested Freedom Party member Abdur Rahim. Investigators are now quizzing all three in remand. b
