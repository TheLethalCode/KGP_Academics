 Dhaka, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com)The government is set to move against listed criminals, extortionists and tender manipulators, the local government minister said on Monday. "We've prepared a list of these people, and the government will take on them in the harshest manner. You will see," said Syed Ashraful Islam, also ruling Awami League general secretary, at a news briefing at AL president's political office in Dhanmondi. He spoke to the media after a meeting with the visiting all-party delegation of the UK. Asked, he commenedt on opposition chief Khaleda Zia's statement about launching a movement against the government after her BNP party's national council in December. "Awami League does not fear threats; (so) it's better not to give such threat. We are congenial enough to discuss all issues," Ashraf said. "There are no gains from threat. We are determined to try the war criminals in the country, no matter how much hindrance may there be. No barrier, threat will be able to resist us. Law will take its own way." Ahsraful came down hard on Khaleda who on Saturday last mocking the government's election pledge of 'charter for change' had said that the government intended to change the country's map. "We once have changed the map destroying her (Khaleda's) beloved Pakistan's map," he said. It was those who were against the Bangladesh's existence and democracy that wanted to change the map. Khaleda had also said that the government would have to leave office before the end of its tenure. Ashraful said, "Her statement is non-democratic and treasonous. An elected government can only be changed through a vote of no-confidence in parliament." Citing recent statements of Khaleda and BNP leaders on the judiciary, AL's law secretary Abdul Matin Khosru said, "Khaleda Zia is talking as if she is mentally retarded. The attorney general is the lawyer of the state. "Such statements are coming from BNP when he is moving its corruption cases." He said BNP-Jamaat alliance government had appointed judge a man with fake certificate without the recommendation of chief justice. "We don't support anyone who disobey the court, let it be the attorney general," Khosru said. Philip Broom of Conservative Party, Nabila Sattar of Labour Party, Paul Speller of Liberal Democratic Party and Marina Narnor of Westminster Foundation, among others, attended the meeting from the visiting UK all-party delegation. bdn
