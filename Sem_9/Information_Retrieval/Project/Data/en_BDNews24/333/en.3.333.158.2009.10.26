 WASHINGTON, Oct 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President Barack Obama asked Spain to pass Cuba a message on the need for democratic reform when he met Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero earlier this month, according to a US official. Six days after their meeting on Oct. 13 at the White House, Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos visited the Caribbean island and met President Raul Castro. "When (Obama) learned that Foreign Minister Moratinos was about to go to Havana, he suggested that Moratinos urge the Castro regime to take steps to reform and improve human rights," the US official said on Sunday, speaking on condition of anonymity. Washington and Havana have had hostile relations since Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution steered Cuba toward communism.

In one sign of a thaw in the relationship, a senior US diplomat who participated last month in talks in Havana about resuming mail service stayed around to meet with Cuban officials and other Cubans. But Obama has said the 47-year-old US trade embargo against Cuba, the main point of contention between the two countries, should stay in place until Cuba releases political prisoners and improves human rights. Moratinos met Castro on Oct. 19 and said the communist leader had affirmed his commitment to economic reform and expressed his desire to continue improving relations with the United States. Spain, one of Cuba's biggest trading partners, has highlighted improved ties between the European Union and the island as one of its priorities when it takes over the rotating EU presidency in Janu
