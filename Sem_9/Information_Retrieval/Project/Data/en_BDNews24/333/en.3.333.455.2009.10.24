 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com correspondent, reports from Stockholm Stockholm, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com) - The caretaker government had failed in its anticorruption drive after it went on to please politicians who forfeit electoral deposits and have little public backing, the prime minister has said. "The anticorruption drive during the caretaker government was alright in the beginning. But, they then started harassing politicians through arrests by filing cases against them." "Problems arose when they went against the politicians. And then it failed," Hasina said, speaking at a civic reception hosted by Bangladeshis at 6pm local time on Friday. "It happened because [the interim administration] wanted to serve politicians whose deposits in elections are forfeited and who don't get public response in politics." However, she added, the caretaker government held a free and fair elections. The prime minister outlined his government's development efforts before the expats and urged them to invest back home. "The scope of investment has been widened in the country so that expatriates can invest there more." She slammed the BNP-led government and the caretaker government, saying "no development work was done during their stints, so the economy stagnated." "In seven years they put the country 20 years back." But, she added, her administration has taken a slew of measures to revive the economy. Her voice laden with emotion, Hasina also spoke of the trial for the assassination of her father independence hero Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. "We moved to hold trial of the killing like those of other ordinary citizens when we had assumed power in 1996. Those who killed have themselves confessed to the murder." She criticised opposition chief Khaleda Zia for not joining an all-party anti-poverty conference on Oct 17. "The agenda of this conference was 'National consensus will prevent poverty' She did not probably like it. She would have come if the agenda would be 'We will loot property, be rich'." Hasina flew to Stockholm, the Swedish capital, to attend an international development summit. She is expected to address the summit on Saturday. On Thursday, she also addressed the launch of the conference. bd
