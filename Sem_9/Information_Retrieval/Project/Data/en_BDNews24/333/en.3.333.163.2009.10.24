<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com)--Vice-chancellor professor A A M S Arefin Siddique has said Dhaka University Central Students Union (DUCSU) elections will be held only on assurance that classes and exams will not be hampered. He said they do not lack intention. "There are a few mental reservations. It is the duty of the student organisations to ensure classes and exams are not hampered. The authority will have no problem once it is ensured." His speech at "Barriers to DUCSU elections and what to do", a discussion session, revealed his intentions. The session was organised by 'Jogajog Ishkul' at the Arts Faculty cafeteria on Friday. Majority of the discussants and leaders of various student organisations demanded removal of barriers to DUCSU election after nearly 19 years. Last DUCSU elections were held on June 6, 1990. Pro-vice-chancellor professor Harun-Ur-Rashid said, "Since decision about holding DUCSU elections are no longer limited to university authority, combined effort of students and teachers are needed." Former DUCSU vice-president and Communist Party of Bangladesh leader Mujahidul Islam Selim said, "Elections cannot be held because of the absence of mentality to accept defeat in the student organisations." Another of DUCSU's former VP, Mahmudur Rahman Manna, said, "Elections can be held any time if the authority wants. No other barriers can stop the elections." Last general secretary and former BNP MP Khairul Kabir Khokon alleged that DUCSU has been inactive due to those who want to rule through repression. Current president of central Chhatra League Mahmud Hasan Ripon said favourable conditions to hold DUCSU are prevalent now more than ever before. "So, the authorities should announce the election schedule." Sultan Salahuddin Tuku, president of Chhatra Dal's central committee, on the other hand said, "Equal right of presence has to be ensured in all halls to create favourable conditions for election. "Three hundred (Jatiytabadi) Chhatra Dal workers have been injured at hands of Chhatra League since the national election. DUCSU elections cannot be held is such conditions." President of Students Unions' central committee Khan Assaduzzaman Masum said, "Current conditions are better than any past conditions. So authority should be fast to take steps for the election." Former VP of Rokeya Hall, Shirin Sultana, GS of Chhatra League Mahfuzul Haidar Chowdhury Roton, Chhatra Dal's GS Amirul Islam Khan Alim, President of Dhaka University's reporter's association Riadul Khan gave speeches in the session amongst others. The last DUCSU committee carried out responsibilities for a long eight-year term instead of the normal one year after being elected in 1990. The DUCSU council was later abolished on May 28 of 1998. After that multiple attempts were taken to hold elections in the then AL tenure. But Chhatra Dal did not participate claiming the conditions unfavourable. Same reason was shown during the last BNP tenure. After the current government came to power, the issue of DUCSU elections came to the fore. Recent remarks of the vice-chancellor that initiative to hold DUCSU elections would be taken has created renewed enthusiasm among student organisations. bdnews2
