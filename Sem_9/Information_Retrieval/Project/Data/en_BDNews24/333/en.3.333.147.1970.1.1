 Dhaka, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com)--Bangladesh Supreme Court Bar Association has condemned the bomb attack purportedly on MP Fazle Noor Taposh, a panel lawyer in the Bangabandhu murder case. It has demanded immediate arrest and exemplary punishment to the perpetrators at a protest meeting at the Supreme Court premises on Thursday. "The attack on Taposh proves that those who do not want the trial of the murder of Bangabandhu are trying to become active," said Mahbubey Alam, attorney general and former president of the association. "Those conspirators want to subvert the trial," he said, adding that this attack may have been carried out to intimidate the public prosecutors. "Those of us who are public prosecutors are not scared after the attack. We are going to fight this case resolutely," Alam said. He asked all to work jointly against the anti-liberation forces. A bomb attack was carried out on Taposh at Motijheel Wednesday night. Though he escaped the attack 13 others were injured. On August 15, 1975, his father Sheikh Fazlul Haque Moni and mother Arzu Begum were also killed. Sheikh Moni was a nephew of independence hero 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. "It will be wrong to think that the attack was on only Taposh," said Amirul Islam, a former president of the association. "After the sweeping victory of pro-liberation forces a group wants to politically destabilise the country and the government," said Rokanuddin Mahmud, Bangladesh Bar Council vice-chairman. He demanded heightened security at the Supreme Court premises. "This attack is not on an individual, it is on the democratic force. There can be more attacks," said former law minister Abdul Matin Khasru. He demanded a quick end to the trial of Bangabanshu murder case. The meeting was presided over by the association's president A F M Mesbah Uddin. Awami League presidium member Yusuf Hossain Humaun, Nurul Islam Sujon MP and Rezaul Karim spoke among others. bdnew
