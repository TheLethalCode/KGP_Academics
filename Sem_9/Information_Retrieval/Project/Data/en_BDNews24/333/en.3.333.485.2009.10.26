<TEXT>
 Narayanganj, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com)Shipbuilders on Sunday sought incentives for a boost to the industry. "We need a 30 percent incentive for the industry for at least five years," Abdullahel Baki, chairman of Ananda Shipyard, the country's leading shipbuilder, said in a seminar. "The government needs to patronise this burgeoning sector to foster its growth." Addressing the seminar, shipping minister Shahjahan Khan said the industry has as much potential to become a top industry as the garment sector. "It can play a significant role to advance the country's economy," he said. The seminar was followed by a German Asia Pacific Business Association delegation's visit to the Ananda shipyard. The delegation contained representatives of German industries like shipbuilding, shipping, textile, renewable energy, food and finance. German envoy Holger Michael, shipping secretary Mannan Howlader, Abdullah Al Kaiser Hasnat MP, Shah Zikrul Ahmed MP and managing director of the company Afroza Bari were also present among others. bdnews24
