<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court resumed hearing arguments on Bangabandhu murder appeals on Wednesday. The five-judge Appellate Division bench headed by Justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam began the 18th day's hearing at 9:45am with advocate Abdur Rezzak Khan presenting his arguments on behalf of death convict Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan. The apex court at the previous day's hearing termed former army chief Maj Gen KM Shafiullah "a coward" for his "inaction" during the assassination of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and family on Aug 15, 1975. Rezzak, like other defence counsels before him, questioned the roles of army chief Shafiullah and deputy army chief Ziaur Rahman on that fateful night. Two lawyers so far concluded their arguments for their respective clients. Barrister Abdullah Al Mamun contended for retired Major Bazlul Huda and retired Lt Col A K M Mohiuddin (lancer). Advocate Khan Saifur Rahman argued for dismissed Lt Col Syed Faruk Rahman and retired Lt Col Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery). The freshly formed bench began hearing the appeals on Mujib murder case on Oct 5.
