<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com)  Probe bodies were formed Sunday following violence and riots by medical students at Chittagong Medical College and Sir Salimullah Medical College in Dhaka that forced the former to close its doors and disrupted patient treatment at the latter's hospital. The violence at both medical colleges were sparked by the battle to recruit fresher students to the student organisations that are associated with political parties. A five-member probe committee was formed to look into violent clashes between Chhatra League and Chhatra Shibir forcing Chittagong Medical College to shut indefinitely on Saturday. The committee headed by CMC vice principal Dr Aminuddin has been asked to submit its investigation report within the next 15 days, said principal Dr Gofranul Haque. The CMC principal told bdnews24.com that all students had left the campus by Sunday morning after the college and its dormitories were declared closed following the bloody clashes. First year MBBS admissions, however, were ongoing despite the student riots and closures, Haque said. Additional police have been posted in and around the hostels and the campus, he said. Losses to the CMC and its hostels in the Saturday riots are yet to be assessed, he added. Violence sparked between Chhatra League and Shibir on Saturday over recruiting fresher students into their organisations. The rioting medical students, some with faces concealed behind hoods and masks, torched some 15 rooms and further vandalised over 50. Police were forced to charge with batons and fire tear gas shells to bring the situation under control. Authorities and student leaders said at least 15 were injured during the two hours of violence. Other members of the probe committee are professors Dr Anwar Hossain, Dr Mohibullah, Dr Zillur Rahman and Dr Saroj Kumar Majumder. Treatment disrupted at Salimullah MCH A three-member probe committee was formed Sunday following a factional clash between two groups of pro-ruling party Chhatra League at Sir Salimullah Medical College the previous day. Treatment at outpatient and emergency departments of the hospital remained disrupted on Sunday following the violence the previous night. Classes were suspended at the college from Sunday morning and the college authorities sat in a meeting of the academic council at around 8am. The probe committee, headed by prof ABM Maksudul Alam, was asked to submit its report by two days. Other members are prof Tejendra Chandra Das and dr Firoz Ahmed Quraishi. At least 20 people were injured during the clashes on Saturday night. A number of rooms of the main student hostel were also ransacked, witnesses said. Vice principal at the college Dr Shamiul Alam Sadi said: "Students have started being admitted into first year. The clash occurred over getting the new students to join up." A group of unruly students went to the outpatient department at around 11am Sunday and forcefully removed the duty doctors from the premises demanding "justice" for Saturday's clashes. Hundreds of patients were waiting there for treatment, said witnesses. bdnews24.com correspondent Kamal Hossain Talukder said both the outpatient and emergency departments at the hospital in old Dhaka remained virtually closed Sunday, causing untold suffering to patients. Patient Amir Hossain, who came all the way from Bikrampur, with chest pain, failed to get any treatment at the outpatient department, his companions complained. Meanwhile intern doctors at the hospital stopped work on Sunday, also demanding action by auhtorities for the assault on their fellow colleagues and medical students. Intern Doctors Council president Dr Syed Ashraful Islam Rajib told bdnews24.com they would not return to work at the outdoor and indoor departments until they received justice for Saturday's events. None except the most critical patients were being treated at the emergency department up to 2pm. Mahbubur Rahman, a doctor of the emergency department, said he was asked by intern doctors and students to provide treatment only to the serious patients who needed emergency attention. The hospital's director Brig Gen Khademul Insan Md Iqbal told reporters the outpatient department would open on Monday. He claimed that they were continuing their treatment activities though the intern doctors were abstaining from work. "Treatment is not being disrupted, but I hope the intern doctors will rejoin work soon," Iqbal said. Several students, claiming that they were assaulted during the clashes on Saturday night, formed a human chain on the campus on Sunday in protest. Extra police were deployed on the campus after Saturday night's clash. bdnews24.
