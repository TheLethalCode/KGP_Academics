 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)--The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has urged all to work collectively to develop and advocate for concrete and tangible steps to be taken by Bangladesh as the leader of LDCs to ease climate change risks in line with the upcoming Conference of Parties (COP15) in Copenhagen. "It is important at policy and financing level to explore linkages and synergies between climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction interventions so that Bangladesh can stand out as the global leader of adapting the inevitable impacts of climate change,"said UNDP Bangladesh country director Stefan Priesner during an inception workshop marking the start of the first climate change adaptation project in Bangladesh. The project, 'Community-Based Adaptation to Climate Change through Coastal Afforestation in Bangladesh', is the first ever field-level project by the government that directly targets vulnerable people living in coastal communities, according to a media release by UNDP. The project focuses on coastal afforestation and livelihood diversification, which is a top priority identified in the Government'sNational Adaptation Programme of Action for Climate Change (NAPA). The five coastal districts in which the project will be operated are Barguna, Patuakhali, Bhola, Noakhali and Chittagong. The project intends to build a natural embankment through coastal afforestation with silt trapping mangrove species, which will offset the adverse impact of sea level rise and at the same time form a natural protection against tidal surges. "The afforestation will provide a protective belt against cyclones; tidal surges and sea level rise for vulnerable coastal communities and also create opportunities for future carbon sequestration. In this context I would like to call on the policy makers to expand this programme all along 700 km of coast line to reduce the imminent climate related risks", Stefan Priesner added. The total value of the project amounts to $ 5.4 million (nearly Tk 37 crore). Of that, $ 3.3 million (nearly Tk 22.7 crore) is contributed by the Global Environment Facility/Least Developed Countries Climate Change Fund (GEF/LDCF), $ 1.1 million ( nearly Tk 7.5 crore Taka) from UNDP and $ 1 million in kind contribution (about Tk 6.8 crore) from the government. It is hoped that this project will be a show-case for other Least Developed Countries (LDCs) also working on climate change adaptation projects. The results of the project are intended to be present to the upcoming Climate Conference in Copenhagen in December 2009. The project will also enhance the adaptive capacity of local communities to anticipate dynamic climate-related threats and protect their livelihoods. It will also improve the individual, institutional and systemic capacity at all levels of public administration to plan for and respond to climate change risks in coastal ar
