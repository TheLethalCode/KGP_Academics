<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com)Defence counsel Khan Saifur Rahman has said his client Syed Faruk Rahman, convicted for the murder of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, "deserves" to have his death penalty commuted to a life sentence. The five-judge Appellate Division bench headed by Justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam had resumed hearing of appeals by death convicts in the Bangabandhu assassination case for the 15th day at 9:45am on Sunday. It ended the proceedings for the day at 1:30pm with advocate Khan Saifur delivering his arguments on the appeal by Faruk. He said Faruk had been on death row for 14 long years and his death sentence "deserved" to be reduced to a life sentence. Citing an example of a previous case at the Appellate Division, Saifur said the penalty for a death convict who has spent that long in a condemned cell can on precedent be reduced to life imprisonment. He also said it has not been proved that Faruk was present at the scene at the time of occurrence and even the following day. Referring to case at the High Court on conspiracy, Khan Saifur said, "As per the state's argument, wife of fugitive death convict Major Khandaker Abdur Rashid, Jubaida Rshid was the key designer of the event. "More than one individual shall have a common intention for a conspiracy. "Conspiracy cannot be proved here as a single individual, according to the state argument, is the key plotter of the incident, he argued. The issue of the assassination being carried out with identical mission has not been proved in the case. The event was orchestrated to topple the government. Hence, the murder charges are irrelevant, the senior lawyer contended. Khan Saifur told reporters after the hearing: " I do not know what the punishment will be, still if there is a way to save life, it has to be pointed out. I have done that in the court. There's no question of hanging someone who has been in a condemned cell for 14 years." Citing statement of different witnesses, he said, "Charges brought against the convicts are motivated as conspiracy and identical mission were not involved in the assassination." Confessional statement was gleaned from Faruk by placing him on long 32-day remand while the law does not permit over 15 days, he said Long remand exerts a negative impact on the mind, Khan Saifur said He said another convict Mohiduddin (artillery) was put on seven-day remand but he was produced before the court after nine days. His statement is not a deliberate and authentic one, he said "There was mention of three deaths under the military law in the case complaint. So no question arises to frame charge under penal code," he said Charges have not been justified lawfully, he said "Nowhere in the case is there any reference to the assassination as an outcome of conspiracy, pre-planning and shared desire." "If the incident is a part of mutiny, the provision for shared desire will not be applied. "If appeal petitioners were discovered at the spot of occurrence, the offence would be taken for mutiny or coup attempt, not an ordinary assassination," he said. "Their presence at the workplace, cantonment, and night parade means that they are innocent." After hearing, chief lawyer for state Anisul Haque said, "When we defend any accused, our last resort is to minimise the sentence." "We plead for replacing death sentence by life term and defence lawyer (Khan Saifur) for the convict has done the same." Khan Saifur will continue with his arguments on Monday. At Thursday's hearing Rahman had told the court that a military coup was orchestrated on Aug 15, 1975. He said the trial of the mutiny should be held under military court martial and the trial and verdicts in the case held under civil law should be nullified. The freshly formed bench headed by Justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam began hearing the appeals on Mujib murder case on Oct 5. A day before, chief justice M M Ruhul Amin constituted the bench with justices Mohammed Abdul Aziz, Bijoy Kumar Das, Mohammed Mozammel Hossain and Surendra Kumar Sinha being the other members. None was allowed to file a case immediately after the assassination of the president and independence hero 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Aug 15, 1975. The government of Khandker Mustaque Ahmed that was installed after the bloody military coup passed an ordinance in November that year indemnifying the perpetrators and closing the door on the possibility of a trial. The Awami League government revoked the indemnity ordinance in 1996 and cleared the way for the trial. Then, President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's personal assistant Muhitul Islam filed a case on Oct 2, 1996 with Dhanmondi Police Station against 24 persons. On Nov 8, 1998, Dhaka sessions judge Golam Rasul awarded death sentences to 15 of the 20 accused. Four of the convictsMajor (retd) Bazlul Huda, Lt Col (dismissed) Syed Faruk Rahman, Lt Col (retd) Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Lt Col (retd) Mohiuddin Ahmedappealed to the High Court against the verdict. On Dec 14, 2000, the High Court gave a split verdict in the caseJustice Md Ruhul Amin upheld death sentences of 10 of the convicts but Justice A B M Khairul Haque retained death sentences of all the 15. On April 30, 2001 Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim of a third High Court bench upheld death sentences of 12 and acquitted three. Of the 12 death convicts, four submitted 'leave to appeal' in the Appellate Division in the same year. Another death convict, lancer AKM Mohiuddin, made an appeal from jail after he was deported from the United States on June 18 last year. Of those having received death sentence, former Lt col Abdur Rashid, Lt Col Shariful Haq Dalim, Lt Col Noor, Risalder Moslemuddin, Lt Col Rashed Chowdhury and Capt Majed are absconding. Absconding convict Aziz Pasha died in exile in Zimbabwe. bdne
