 Dhaka, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com)  Abdur Razzak and Rubel Hossain brought Bangladesh back into the contest in the first of the five-match one-day series against Zimbabwe at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur on Tuesday. Left-arm spinner Razzak ripped out three wickets, two off successive deliveries in the eighth over and four overs later Bangladesh's quickest bowler Rubel Hossain had Hamilton caught at superbly at backward point to leave the tourists on 62 for four in 13 overs.
