 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com)Former state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar will not be questioned in police custody as the High Court has ordered police to question him at the jail gate. The bench of justices Syed Mohammed Dastagir Hossain and Mohammed Roisuddin made the order on Wednesday on a petition filed by Babar. Babar's lawyer Gazi Quamrul Islam filed the petition seeking an order for his client to be questioned at the jail gate. "Babar is now very sick. If he is taken into remand his life might be at risk," Islam told reporters after filing the petition. Khandaker Mahbub Hossain, another lawyer, told reporters after the order that the High Court had directed the police to question him at the jail gate. Earlier, the first additional chief metropolitan magistrate for Dhaka, Ehsanul Haque, granted police five days to grill the ex-junior minister in connection with the Aug 21, 2004 grenade attack on an Awami League rally. Babar, already behind bars since March this year, was shown arrested in the grenade attack case on Monday. Babar began serving 17 years on March 5 this year in an arms case. The grenade attack on the rally at Bangabandhu Avenue killed at least 23 people and left scores injured, including prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who was then opposition leader. Some 22 people stand charged in the cases, including former BNP state minister Abdus Salam Pintu, his brother Maolana Tajuddin, also the alleged grenade supplier, and Mufti Hannan, leader of banned Islamist outfit Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami. Of them, 13 accused including Pintu and Hannan are now behind bars while the remaining accused are on the run. The Criminal Investigation Department pressed charges in two cases, a murder case and an explosives case, on June 11 last year. Some 61 among 412 witnesses have so far testified. The witnesses include president Zillur Rahman, prime minister Sheikh Hasina, home minister Sahara Khatun and AL's former general secretary Abdul Jalil. b
