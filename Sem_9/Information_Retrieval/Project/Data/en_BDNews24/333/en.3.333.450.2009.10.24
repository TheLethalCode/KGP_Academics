 Dhaka, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com)Opposition leader and the BNP chief Khaleda Zia said Saturday a people's movement would topple the Awami League government before their five-year tenure, given the "prevailing situation" in the country. "This government is functioning to change the country's map in the name of a 'charter for change'," she said, while addressing a discussion programme 'protesting the government's actions'. Pro-BNP lawyers claimed blatant interference by the government in the judiciary, the collapse of law and order and torture of opposition leaders in custody, in the discussion held at the Supreme Court Bar Council premises and organised by the Jatiyatabadi Ainjibee Forum. The party's senior leaders, such as justice TH Khan, former speaker Jamiruddin Sarkar, and BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain also spoke. Khaleda said, "The people will act, the government will have to depart from power before their time." She presented complaints against the government of politicisation in the judiciary and administration, and tender grabbing by ruling party backers. "People realise the present situation of the country's insecurity." "Those in power are too busy ensuring security for themselves to provide security for the people," said Khaleda in a reference to the recently passed law to ensure lifetime security for members of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's family, which includes his daughter prime minister Sheikh Hasina. "The government have failed the people," said the opposition chief. "They're now plotting conspiracies against the country as they came to power to do so," she said "They were brought to power to grant a corridor to India and allow them to construct the Tipaimukh Dam. Thus they're pledged to foreign powers," said Khaleda, a two-time former prime minister. She claimed her previous BNP-led administrations "neither sacrificed the country's interests nor ignored their will". "No election pledges of this government will be implemented," she said, adding that people "are well aware of this". Accusing the government for "torturing people of all professions", Khaleda said journalists were the most recent victims, referring to an recent report of a RAB attack on a newspaper reporter. She called for national unity "to fight the conspiracies against the country". Khaleda also reiterated BNP's claim that the Awami League government wanted to re-establish BAKSAL, "one party rule", in the country. "They don't want democracy." Regarding the upcoming BNP council on Dec 8, she said, "We will revive our party through the council and work to protect democracy in this country." bd
