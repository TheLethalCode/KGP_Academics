 Chittagong, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com)  Tension returned to Chittagong Medical College Sunday as Chhatra League and Chhatra Shibir activists continued to clash on campus Sunday despite riots forcing the college to close its doors the day before and evacuate general students. Three troublemakers were detained Sunday, said Nurul Huda, assistant police commissioner of Chittagong Metropolitan Police. The chase and counter chase between the two groups of medical students reached Chatteshwari roundabout beyond the campus, said witnesses. The trouble started when Chhatra League activists chased the Shibir group as they tried to enter a male dormitory, said witnesses and police. "Shibir tried to enter the male dormitory over the wall at around 2:30pm. Chhatra League prevented them," said sub-inspector Zahurul Haque of CMC Police Station. The detained were identified as Mashrur Hossain, Rajib Md Waliullah and 'Rusho'. Their organisational identity could not be confirmed. Extra police have been posted on the campus since the clashes on Saturday. Though CMC remains closed, the admission process for the first year MBBS course was still going on, said the authorities. Violence sparked between Chhatra League and Shibir on Saturday over recruiting fresher students into their organisations. The rioting medical students, some with faces concealed behind hoods and masks, torched some 15 rooms and further vandalised over 50. Police were forced to charge with batons and fire tear gas shells to bring the situation under control. A five-member committee has been formed to investigate the incident. The general students had evacuated dormitories by Sunday morning following orders of the authorities. bdne
