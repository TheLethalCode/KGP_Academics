 Dhaka, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com)  At least 20 people were injured in a factional clash between two groups of pro-ruling party Bangladesh Chhatra League over control of Sir Salimullah Medical College campus. Officer in charge at Kotwali Police Station Salauddin said: "The violence began at around 9:15pm over gaining control on campus." "But we have brought the situation under control," he told bdnews24.com at around 10.30pm. Vice principal at the college doctor Shamiul Alam Sadi said: "Students have started being admitted into first year." "The clash, in fact, occurred over getting the new students to join their organisation." The injured were admitted to Sir Salimullah Medical College Hospital and other private clinics. Chittagong Medical College was closed sine die earlier in the day following a violent clash between Chhatra League and pro-Jamaat-e-Islami Chhatra Shibir leading to riots, arson and vandalism on the campus. bdnews2
