 Dhaka, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court ended hearing arguments on the Bangabandhu murder appeals on Monday for the sixteenth day. The five-judge Appellate Division bench headed by Justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam ended the hearing at 1:35pm which had begun at 9:45am. At the Monday's hearing Abdur Rezzak Khan, counsel for death convict Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, started delivering his arguments after advocate Khan Saifur Rahman concluded his arguments on behalf of death convict Syed Faruk Rahman. On the fifteenth day Khan Saifur said Faruk "deserves" to have his death penalty commuted to a life sentence. Faruk has been on the death row for 14 long years and his death sentence "deserved" to be reduced to a life sentence, he said. Khan Saifur also said it has not been proved that Faruk was present at the scene at the time of assassination of Mujib and his family. The freshly formed bench headed by Justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam began hearing the appeals on Mujib murder case on Oct 5. A day before, chief justice M M Ruhul Amin constituted the bench with justices Mohammed Abdul Aziz, Bijoy Kumar Das, Mohammed Mozammel Hossain and Surendra Kumar Sinha being the other members. bdne
