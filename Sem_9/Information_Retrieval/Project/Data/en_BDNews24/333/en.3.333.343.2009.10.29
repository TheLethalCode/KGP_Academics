 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has suggested an international committee be formed under the United Nations to counter climate change. Hasina made the suggestion at a meeting on Thursday with visiting French environment minister Jean-Louis Borloo. The meeting focused on the UN climate conference in Copenhagen in December, as well as bilateral issues including trade relations between the two countries, said the prime minister's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad. Hasina expressed the need for more international action and combined global efforts to combat climate change, said Azad. She also informed the French minister about Bangladesh's 15-point action plan to face the impacts of global warming and rising sea levels. Borloo, the most senior member of the French cabinet after prime minister Franois Fillon, conveyed the greetings of president Nicholas Sarkozy. He also extended an invitation for Hasina to visit France before the Copenhagen conference. Hasina also invited the French president to Bangladesh, Azad said. Foreign ministry officials say this is the first visit of a French minister in 10 years. They also say France wants Bangladesh, one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, to play an active role in the Copenhagen talks in December. Borloo was scheduled to have lunch with Dipu Moni at state guest house Padma to discuss bilateral issues as well as the upcoming climate change negotiations in Copenhagen. The European Union and developing economiesChina and Indiaare in dissent on reduction of greenhouse gases to combat global warming and climate change. They discussed the trade and diplomatic relationship between the two countries, the Copenhagen conference and more international help and combined efforts to counter climate change, said Azad. Scientists say small island nations and low-lying countries such as Bangladesh may loose significant chunks of their landmass owing to sea level rises caused by melting polar caps. Bangladesh has taken 15 action plans worth $ 100 million to fight the difficulties wrought by climate change, prime minister Hasina told the French minister. The work of river dredging has already started, she added. Hasina called for formation of a committee under the United Nations to counter climate change during the meeting. The French minister has welcomed the speech of Hasina in Stockholm about climate change. French ambassador Charley Causeret was present at that time. Earlier, in the morning the non-resident Ambassador of Kazakhstan to Bangladesh Bakhtibek Shabarbayev made a courtesy call on Hasina. He expressed interest about opening a consulate office of Kazakhstan in Bangladesh and Hasina assured him of taking required steps for that. Shabarbayev praised her leadership and said the sweeping victory of Awami League in the ninth parliament is a significant incident. Hasina discussed climate change with him, said Azad. Two crore people of Bangladesh will be affected due to climate change, she told Shabarbayev. bd
