<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com)The purported bomb attack on Awami League legislator Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh only reflects the worsening security in the country, BNP joint secretary general Goyeshwar Chandra Roy has said. "If a person like MP Taposh is under attack then it is needless to say the plight of the common people. That's why the people of this country are concerned about law and order situation," he said at the party office at Naya Paltan on Friday. He condemned the attack and demanded trial of the perpetrators. Goyeshwar urged the government to arrest and put them on trial instead of seeing it from a political angle. A bomb attack was carried out in front of Taposh's office when he was returning home from his office at Motijheel Wednesday night. Though he escaped the attack 13 others were injured. On Aug 15, 1975, his father Sheikh Fazlul Haque Moni and mother Arzu Begum were also killed. Sheikh Moni was a nephew of independence hero 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. About the preparation of BNP's council on Dec 8, he said the organising committee, led by chairperson Khaleda Zia, and sub-committees have been formed. Goyeshwar was released on bail Tuesday after spending eight days behind bars on illegal wealth charges. "The dispute in the convening committees in the troublesome districts will be resolved within a few days," he said. The process of forming committees has started in the districts, upazilaa and thanas through councils, said Goyeshwar, also the convener of the broadcast sub-committee. "We will be able to form all committees through the council within the stipulated time. He urged the government to implement the campaign pledges. "Our leader is talking about cooperating with the government time and again. If the government moves the country ahead in the interest of common good then we will surely cooperate," the joint secretary general said. b
