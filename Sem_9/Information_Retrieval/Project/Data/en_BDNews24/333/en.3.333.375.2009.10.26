<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com)Public Procurement Rules will see further proposed revisions, the finance minister said on Sunday. The changes will be made to ensure transparency and inject pace to the government's development programmes, AMA Muhith said after attending a cabinet division meeting on PPR. He did not mention the rules to be revised. The cabinet on Oct 5 approved an amendment to the Public Procurement Act relaxing the rules for experience of contractors, and introducing a lottery system, for public work orders of up to Tk 2 crore. Opposition BNP protested the amendment, saying it was made to award contracts to ruling party leaders and supporters. When asked on Sunday, Muhith did not say if this particular amendment would be revised or revoked. Asked if reported conflicts with developments partners had arisen, regarding the recently approved amendments, he said, "We don't have any argument among us on this issue while we're also following their suggestions." Several newspapers have reported conflicts with the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank who said the government's proposed PPR changes would "have a bearing on the role of development partners". But the agencies have not made any such statement formally. Muhith said Sunday the cabinet would soon approve the final recommendations for a proposed public procurement bill to be tabled in parliament. The meeting, chaired by the planning minister AK Khandaker, was also attended by communications minister Syed Abul Hossain, housing and public works minister Abdul Mannan Khan, agriculture minister Matia Chowdhury and secretaries of the ministries. The meeting will continue on Monday, said Muhith. bdn
