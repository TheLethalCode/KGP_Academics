 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com)  Local entrepreneurs must overcome their sloth and hesitation in domestic investment which in turn would renew the growth of foreign direct investment, finance minister AMA Muhith has said. After attending a meeting with a visiting German trade delegation on Wednesday morning, the finance minister said, "The two cardinal reasons of hesitant investment are a new government and the global recession." "In the first place, everybody looks askance at the new government. The global crunch has obviously cut investments all over. "Which is why we now have concentrated more in the domestic investment sector. Once our internal investors open their purses without much ado, the foreign investments should also pour in," he said. Muhith said, investment growth involves a number of complicated issues like high bank rates and bureaucratic rigmarole, which are being addressed already. Steps to solve the problems of gas and power shortages have also been taken, he added. Muhith hoped the prevailing sloth in investment will pass in the near future. He said, "It's a good news that investment in capital machinery saw an increase in September." About his meeting with the German businessmen, he said, "They expressed keen interest in investing in our emerging shipbuilding sector." "The Germans said, Bangladesh, once an importer of ships has turned into a shipbuilding nation, which will play a positive role in our economic uplift. "This should also help in augmenting foreign direct investments, they said. The Germans have expressed their eagerness to invest in gas and power sectors too." At the meeting held in NEC conference room at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar Wednesday morning, the 17-strong German delegation was headed by Peter Clansen, chairman of German Asia Pacific Business Association. German ambassador in Bangladesh Holger Michael and Bangladesh-German Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Saiful Islam were present at the meeting. The delegation is scheduled to hold an official press briefing on their visit later at noon. bd
