<TITLE> Court says Moeen's power of attorney legal </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court on Tuesday said the vokalatnama, or power of attorney, submitted by ex-army chief Moeen U Ahmed for contesting the Tk 100 crore defamation suit by the former BNP state minister for power Iqbal Hasan Mahmud Tuku was acceptable. The third joint district sessions judge SM Saiful Islam accepted the vokalatnama, rejecting a petition challenging its legality by Tuku. The court set Nov 17 for the submission of Moeen's response. Tuku on Oct 1 filed the petition challenging the power of attorney on the plea that proper legal procedure was not followed during the submission. The power secretary is also an accused in the case. Protesting the former army chief's comment made on Mar 27, 2007 that a whopping Tk 20,000 crore was smuggled out of the country from the power sector alone during the 2001-06 BNP-led alliance rule, Tuku filed the Tk 100 crore defamation suit on July 12. He mentioned in the case statement that the present state minister for power had said in parliament on Feb 5 that the BNP-led alliance government's total power sector allocation was Tk 13, 500 crore, which automatically trashes the ex-army chief's allegation. bdne
