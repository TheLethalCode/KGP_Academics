<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com)  Traders at Islamia and Babupura markets in Nilkhet and associates of a man who claimed himself to be owner of the markets chased each others over for retaining control over the property on Monday. Traders were seen taking position in front of the markets by closing the shutters of their shops. Shah Alam, owner of Islamia Market's Bidyaniketan Library told bdnews24.com that on hearing that one Khairul Hassan Khokan from Tejgaon came to occupy the markets with his associates early in the morning, the traders went there at around 7am. Both the groups were locked in chasing each other in several phases, he said. Khokan left the scene with his associates as the number of traders increased, Alam said. Md Mokbul Hossain, president of Islamia Market's Traders' Association, said Khokan had claimed himself as the owner of the two markets. "These two markets have a total land measuring 62 decimal. The process of allocating the land at Tk 9 lakh among the traders started in 1998 and it is still ongoing," he said. Hossain said he had been running business there with government registration since 1982. "Under the circumstances, Khokan was trying to evict us," he said. Babupura Small Traders' Association president Belayet Hossain said Khokan and his associates had attacked them with pistols and machetes in the morning. A security guard, Nurunnabi, was injured in the clash at that time, he claimed. The traders alleged some files and of papers of the association office were set on fire by the attackers. Enayet Karim, former president of Islamia Traders' Association, said they would shut their shops until the government assured them of security. New Market police chief AM Quamrul Islam said the court would decide as to who was the real owner of the land. "We are watching so that no further clashes occurs in the market," he said. bdnew
