 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com)  The third defence counsel concluded his arguments on Wednesday in the Bangabandhu murder case appeals. The five-judge Appellate Division bench, headed by Justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam, heard the concluding deliberations of Abdur Rezzak Khan on behalf of death convict Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan. Barrister Abdullah Al Mamun also began his arguments for another death convict retired Lt Col A K M Mohiuddin (lancer). He also argued for another death convict appellant, retired major Bazlul Huda, earlier in the proceedings. The 18th day's hearing began at 9:45am and ended at 1.30pm. As he concluded his arguments, Rezzak repeatedly told the court that his client Shahriar Rashid was not involved in the Bangabandhu killing. "One cannot be given death sentence if one is not directly involved with a killing," he told the court at the previous day's hearing. Rezzak, like other defence counsels before him, questioned the roles of army chief Shafiullah and deputy army chief Ziaur Rahman on that fateful night. The Supreme Court began hearing the appeals on Mujib murder case on Oct 5.
