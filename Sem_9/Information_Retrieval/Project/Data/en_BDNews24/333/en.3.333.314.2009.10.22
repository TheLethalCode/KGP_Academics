 Dhaka, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com)BNP organising secretary Amanullah Aman was released on bail on Thursday, a prisons official said. He was freed from the prison cell at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University at 8:40pm, Touhidul Islam, superintendent at Dhaka Central Jail told bdnews24.com. A Dhaka court on Wednesday granted the former state minister bail in a case that accuses him of an armed attack to kill businessman Osman Gani. The case involving an armed attack on Gani was filed by the victim's brother, Abdul Mannaf, with Mohammadpur police in the capital on May 31 this year. One of the accused gunmen in the case, Ataur Rahman, in a confessional statement said he and others had acted on Aman's order and shot Gani. Aman was arrested at Zia International Airport as he returned from medical treatment in Singpaore on Sept 30. Gani, a BNP activist and a businessman from Aman's parliamentary constituency in Keraniganj, earlier told bdnews24.com that he had been refused nomination by BNP for Keraniganj constituency. Aman who contested as the BNP candidate later pressed Gani to work for him. As Gani refused to do so, Aman sent terrorists to kill Gani on May 29. The case details, seen by bdnews24.com senior legal affairs correspondent, say Gani and his friend Abdus Sobhan were in a car at Mohammadpur in the capital on May 29 when gunmen stopped their car near Salimullah Road and opened fire. Gani, it was alleged, took five bullets in his body. Former DUCSU vice president Aman was also arrested during the immediate past military-installed caretaker government. bdnews24
