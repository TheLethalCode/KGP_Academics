Speaker Abdul Hamid adjourned the third session on October 13, which started on Sept 7. Earlier, parliament went into first recess until October 4 for Eid and Puja vacation. "We are yet to decide about duration of the current session. "It may either continue through the first week of November or Nov 26 with another adjournment," Speaker Abdul Hamid told bdnews24.com Tuesday afternoon at his office in parliament. He said some ruling party leaders wanted to see parliament's next session (4th) to convene on Jan 25 to mark the first day of the 9th parliament. "If we want to see first session of the next year start on Jan 25, we must stretch the session at least up to Nov 26," said Hamid.
