 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com)Rapid Action Battalion officer flight lieutenant Anisur Rahman was withdrawn from duty on Sunday over the incident of torture on a Daily New Age journalist. "He has been closed to the headquarters and later would be sent back to the Air Force," the director of Legal and Media wing of the elite force, Abul Kalam Azad, said. The anticrime force, according to the daily, detained F M Masum on Oct 22, its staff correspondent, from his rented house at Jatrabari in Dhaka and severely tortured him in public. RAB later tried to frame him as a drugs dealer keeping him in detention for around 12 hours. RAB issued a note of apology saying that an untoward incident had taken place as a team of RAB-10 went to an area of Jatrabari in an anti-drug drive at around 12:30pm. "A sincere apology is being offered on behalf of RAB. RAB is treating the incident with special importance and RAB headquarters has already formed a committee to probe the incident. Proper punishment will be meted out to those responsible for the incident," said the statement. Journalists, officials and employees working at the New Age said in a joint meeting that RAB members, led by flight lieutenant Anis, on Thursday beat up Masum by binding his hands and legs for half an hour. They planted six bottles of banned Phensidyl cough syrups on Masum's bed and later retrieved them, they alleged. Masum was seriously injured and is now undergoing treatment at a private hospital in the capital. bdn
