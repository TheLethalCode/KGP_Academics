 Dhaka, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com)  The country will face a serious crisis if the foreign companies are allowed to extract minerals from sea blocks in line with a Production Sharing Contract drafted in 2008, a pressure group said on Saturday. The National Committee on Protection of Oil, Gas and Mineral Resources, Power and Ports asked the government to revoke such contracts detrimental for the interest of the country. "Bangladesh is facing a severe crisis due to 'looting contracts'. The government is betraying people though it came to power with their votes," Sheikh Mohammed Shahidullah, convener of the committee, said launching a convention. The convention opened at around 11am at the Institute of Engineers, Bangladesh to press for demands including "an export ban on oil, gas and coal and revoking model PSC 2008". The military-installed interim government drafted the model PSC in 2008 on proposals by US-based ConocoPhillips and Irish company Tullow Oil for oil and gas exploration in the Bay of Bengal. The government in August approved the proposals to award the two companies contracts to explore in three offshore blocks under the PSC. ConocoPhillips, the third largest energy company in the US, will get deep-sea blocks 10 and 11. Shallow-sea block 5 will be awarded to Irish company Tullow that already operates in Bangladesh's Bhangura gas field. The National Committee is protesting against the deals; it claims the PSC would allow the two foreign companies to export up to 80 percent of gas extracted. The government has said the committee was confusing the public on the issue with "misinformation". Shahidullah said: "Prime minister Sheikh Hasina said gas would be extracted for development. "Though the extraction operation will start now, the gas will be extracted 12 years later. It will not solve the current crisis. "The gas will be eventually looted abroad," he said. Shahidullah asked the government to deal with the current energy crisis by excavating coal through shaft mining. "If coal extraction starts now, the energy problem can be solved within four years," he said. Shahidullah praised the government's many initiatives in education, agriculture and jute sectors. "Though the government has taken positive steps in education, agriculture and jute sectors people are worried about its moves in commerce and energy sectors," he said. The national committee's member secretary Anu Muhammad, justice Golam Rabbani, Prof Khan Sarwar Murshid, Prof Serajul Islam Chowdhury and Col (retd) Kazi Nuruzzaman attended the convention. Among politicians were Workers Party of Bangladesh president Rashed Khan Menon, Communist Party of Bangladesh president Monjurul Ahsan Khan, Bangladesh Samajtantrik Dal convener Khalekuzzman, Ganatantri Party's Tipu Biswas. The convention began by commemorating those who were killed while protesting against the open pit mining at Dinajpur's Phulbari Coalmine. bdnew
