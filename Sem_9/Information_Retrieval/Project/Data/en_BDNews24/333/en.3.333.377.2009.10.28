 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com)  National identity cards will have a validity of 15 years, and renewal will have to be applied for at least six months before expiry, according to a new bill tabled by the law minister in parliament on Wednesday. The 'National Identity Registration Authority (NIRA) Bill 2009' was tabled with these clauses and a maximum seven-year jail term for those giving false information, carrying multiple and/or fake National IDs. Over 85 million registered voters have been provided National Identity cards to date, under the programme that began last year. Speaker Abdul Hamid forwarded law minister Shafiq Ahmed's bill to the standing committee on law, justice and parliamentary affairs ministry for further scrutiny. The committee is to submit a report within 7 days. The bill has provision for prison sentences, up to a maximum seven years and fines of up to Tk 1 lakh, for anyone providing false information or forging National IDs. The same provision was kept for Election Commission officials involved such crimes. The bill also says the EC will be responsible for manufacture, distribution and preservation of National IDs under it normal voter listing programme. National IDs will be given to all registered voters. They will have a validity of 15 years from date of issue and have to be renewed by paying required fees along with application to EC at least six months before expiry. Errors on National ID cards can also be fixed by paying required fees along with application to EC, but errors made by the EC will be fixed free of charge. In case of relinquishing citizenship, the ID card will be cancelled and the ID number cannot be used again. Availing government services with National ID cards can be started after circulars from concerned authorities. But, the new law proposes, such circulars cannot be issued until all eligible citizens have their IDs. Showing or submission of National ID cannot be made compulsory for services until such circulars are given. Also no citizen can be deprived from any facility or services for not having a National ID card. The 'National Identity Registration Authority Ordinance 2008' was issued under the past caretaker government. It was presented in the first session of the parliament on Jan 25 but was not immediately enacted. A new draft law was approved at a cabinet meeting on Sep 14 to continue the ongoing work of issuing National IDs. The accompanying text of the NIRA bill says, "The EC is issuing National ID cards to voters." "The ID is being issued for official use in government and non-government offices." "Since the ID has a variety of roles and for continuing its work, the EC has requested the law, justice and parliamentary affairs ministry to renew the law." bdnews24.com/
