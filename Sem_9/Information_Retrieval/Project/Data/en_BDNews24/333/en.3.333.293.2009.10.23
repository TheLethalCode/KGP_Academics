 Dhaka, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com)--Dhaka University will take measures against Mohiuddin Ahmed, a teacher and spokesman for Hizb ut-Tahrir, if he keeps being involved with the disbanded Islamist outfit, the vice-chancellor said. "We have to see now if Mr Mohiuddin is still involved with the organisation. We will definitely take steps against him if he is involved," professor A A M S Arefin Siddique told bdnews24.com on Friday. A statement reading "The Hizb ut-Tahrir will continue with its movement with Muslim Ummah" was issued after the police foiled a news conference called at his house on IBA Compound, Green Road earlier in the morning. The warning from the VC came after Ahmed, an assistant professor at the Institute of Business Administration of the university, has been mentioned as the chief coordinator of the organisation in a press release. "Any teacher of Dhaka University can independently take part in any political activities. Mr Mohiuddin have so far also done that." "So, there is something to see here since the government has disbanded his organisation." The government on Thursday banned the Hizb ut-Tahrir in Bangladesh, saying the Islamist outfit posed threat to public safety. "We had kept the outfit under watch for long," home minister Sahara Khatun told bdnews24.com on Thursday. "Based on a final report from intelligence agencies, we took the decision today." More details were given to bdnews24.com by the home secretary, Abdus Sobhan Sikder. "The ban on the activities of Hizb ut-Tahrir will take effect from today (Thursday)," the secretary said. "The organisation has been banned in quite a number of countries, including Turkey because of their involvement with terrorist activities," he said. "We have also been observing their activities for so long. It has seemed to us the activities of this organisation is threatening to the public security in the country," Sikder said. Hizb ut-Tahrir became the fifth militant organisation to be banned in Bangladesh, the home secretary said. Four organisations have been banned in Bangladesh since 2001 on charges of links with militancy. They are Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami, Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh, Jagrata Muslim Janata Bangladesh and Shahadat-e Al Hikma. bd
