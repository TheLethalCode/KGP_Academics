 Ansar Hossain bdnews24.com correspondent Cox's Bazar, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com) -The Cox's Bazar district administration has taken up a project to develop a plantation of coconut and date trees along the sea beach to check land subsidence and promote an environment-friendly tourism industry. The plantation would be grown in five rows along a stretch of 110-kilometre-long sea beach running from Nazirartek to Teknaf, officials said. A demand letter seeking Tk 2.53 crore was sent to the forest and environment ministry for implementation of the project. Deputy commissioner Mohammad Giasuddin Ahmed claimed that the government in principle agreed to implement it to develop the country's untapped tourism potentials. A report sent to the ministry said there are 'Zhau trees' in some areas of the beach. Since roots of these trees are soft, they are easily swept away by sea waves. Already, thousands of Zhau trees along some seven-kilometre stretch from Nazirartek to Himchhari fell down in the face of tidalbores during last rainy season. Zhau trees do not bear fruits, have no timber value and never nestle birds thereon. Taking opinions from experts, the district administration has decided to plant coconut, date and palm trees along the beach. If these trees can be planted in four rows, they would build natural barrier creating elavated sand-dunes on the shores of the sea. Those trees would bear fruits that could generate economic activities through setting up food processing and agro-based factories. But most importantly, those trees would help create a beautiful landscape to attract more tourists to this unspoiled and wonderful sea beach, one of the world's longest. The project will be implemented following the guidelines of social forestry where people from all tiers of the society would be involved. Additional deputy commissioner (revenue) Mohammad Sukur Ali said the existing Zhau trees on the beach are not environment-friendly. Many, specially hotel and motel owners, do not like Zhau trees on the beach because they obstruct the seaview. Under the social forestry project, 50 percent benefits would go to the local people, 20 percent to Union Parishads and 10 percent to authorized NGOs. The residue income would be utilized for maintenance and creation of a revolving fund for further developing the plantation. Sukur Ali said if coconut and date trees are planted in four rows, 600 saplings could be planted along a stretch of one kilometre. On that basis, 60,000 plants may be planted along 100 kilometers. Committees at district, upazila and union parishad level would be formed to implement and supervise the project, said officials. Local members of parliament would be advisers to the district committee while deputy commissioner would be convener and additional deputy commissioner (revenue ) the member secretary of the project. Concerned government officials, UP chairmen and NGO representatives nominated by the deputy commissioner would be enlisted as members of these committees. Deputy commissioner Mohammad Giasuddin Ahmed told journalists that a financial estimate for the project was sent to the forest and environment ministry which has accepted the proposal in principle. It was estimated that Tk 1,53,600 would be spent for plantation on one square kilometer area. The total project cost would be Tk 2.53 crore. A small fund would be earmarked for motivation and training of local people, it was learnt. Officials said work on the project is expected to start in the next rainy season (April-May 2010), subject to fund availability. bdne
