RAB issued a note of apology saying that an untoward incident had taken place as a team of RAB-10 went to an area of Jatrabari in an anti-drug drive at around 12:30pm. "A sincere apology is being offered on behalf of RAB," the statement reads. Opposition BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia condemned the persecution of Masum. "The country has reached such a dire position that journalists are also falling victim to torture," she said Journalists, officials and employees working at the New Age demanded punishment to the perpetrators after a judicial probe. "RAB is treating the incident with special importance and RAB headquarters has already formed a committee to probe the incident," the statement said. "Proper punishment will be meted out to those responsible for the incident," it also said. Journalists, officials and employees working at the New Age said in a joint meeting that RAB members, led by flight lieutenant Anis, on Thursday beat up Masum by binding his hands and legs for half an hour.
