 Dhaka, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh is seen as one of the four countries whose economy remains very steady amid ongoing global recession, the Bangladesh Bank governor said on Saturday. The central bank boss Atiur Rahman was speaking at a seminar on 'The Global Economic Slump: Cause, Evaluation and Remedy' in the capital on Saturday Atiur said, "We attended the annual general meeting of World Bank-IMF some days back as well as a meeting of Commonwealth finance ministers." The two conferences focused on the global recession and exit strategies, he said. "Representatives of all the countries present unanimously agreed that China, India, Japan and Bangladesh were in good condition, while almost all other countries have been badly hit by the economic turmoil," he said. The governor said, it was "a matter of prestige for us as a nation" that Bangladesh is one of the countries whose economy remained steady despite the global economic crunch. The four countries had achieved an average 6 percent economic growth, he said. "Bangladesh saw 5.9 percent growth last year which might exceed 6 percent during the current year." He also credited much of the economic stability to "our farmers," who maintained farm output in crucial times. "Our farmers are our real heroes." Apart from production, farmers are contributing immensely to create internal demand in the country, he added. He said Bangladesh survived the onslaught of global financial slum mainly due to agriculture, small and medium industries, and remittances from overseas, which he called "the driving forces of our economy". Prof Mohammad Arif, executive director of the Centre for Research on Globalisation And Economic Policy in Malaysia, presented the key paper in the seminar hosted by Daffodil University at Dhanmondi and presided over by chairman of the university's board Sabur Khan. bd
