 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)--About 3,500 border guards will stand trial for the BDR mutiny expected to start in November, the home minister said on Thursday. The trial will be held at separate courts in the six divisions under BDR Act. "The law ministry has said it will be possible to start the mutiny trial in November," home minister Sahara Khatun told reporters Thursday after the fourth cabinet committee meeting on law and order at the Secretariat. The government has decided to constitute a special tribunal following the Supreme Court opinion to try crimes such as killings and lootings during the Feb 25-26 mutiny. The minister said trial proceedings for killings, looting and other crimes will be held later in a special tribunal after charges are pressed in court. About 1,000 BDR soldiers could be accused of killing and looting in the special tribunal, Sahara said. Law minister Shafique Ahmed said on Oct 21 that the mutiny trial would be held after the constitution of separate courts in the six divisions by the border guards' chief. Ahmed said the trial would be concluded in 135 days. He also said those accused of mutiny would be allowed to appoint lawyers, but the lawyers would not be able to participate in arguments. They can only provide suggestions to the defendants, the minister had said. The government on Sept 15 decided to try the mutineers under the BDR Act and those charged with killings and looting under the penal code by a speedy trial tribunal. At least 73 people, including 57 army officers deputed to the paramilitary force, were killed in the bloody Feb 25-26 mutiny at the Bangladesh Rifles' Peelkhana headquarters in Dhaka. On Thursday's meeting, the minister said the committee had talks about the bomb attack on Awami League MP Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh, one of state counsels of the Bangabandhu murder appeals case and member of the Bangabandhu family. "We have discussed the government's strategy on the matter," she said. Among others, law minister Shafique Ahmed, LGRD minister Syed Ashraful Islam, information minister Abul Kalam Azad, state minister for home Shamsul Haq Tuku, home secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikder and high officials of RAB and police were present. b
