 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com correspondent Stockholm, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com)Some 500 Bangladeshis and Indians defied daylong drizzle far away from home in Stockholm on a chilling Saturday to bask in the warmth of a shared heritage. The raison d'tre was to celebrate the Shyama Puja and Durga Puja, two biggest festivals of the Bengali Hindus. Bishnu Chakrabarty, the common priest of Stockholm, told bdnews24.com, "This year we prayed to Mother Kali for all people, for a better Bangladesh, for a better world." One of the members of the Puja committee, Prasenjit Chowdhury Luvlu said: "We are organising Kali Puja for 11 years now along with Durga Puja, we wanted to introduce our new generation to Bengali culture." Brinda Ganguly, born to a Bangladeshi father and Swedish mother, performed classical Bengali dance at a cultural programme. "I consider myself as a full Bengali, my mother is Swedish though," she told bdnews24.com. "I feel the Bengali culture very close to my heart," a beaming Ganguly said. Shayan, Shubhom and Prit, second-generation immigrants, said they were "really happy". "We wait for this day throughout the year," Shayan said. Why? "Because we can meet all Bengali people under a single roof. "Though we born here, we really admire our Bengali culture, Bengali food and even we are studying in Swedish school, we are learning Bengali." Many Bangladeshi students also attended the programme. One of them, Labanya Roy, said: "I love and miss Bangladesh, my family very much. At least I'm feeling at home today."
