<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com)Biman Bangladesh has decided to resume flights to New York, from Nov 24, after a long break of over three years, Biman managing director said on Wednesday. "Yes, we've decided to re-launch the flights from November 24," chief executive officer and MD Zakiul Islam told bdnews24.com. "We will initially be using a Boeing-767, for a short period, about six weeks." "That is, until two Boeing 777-200ERs, which we are leasing but have been delayed, reach us," said Islam. Biman's New York flights were stopped in July 2006, as Biman was suffering significant financial losses as well as aircraft crises. Since then, several attempts were made, but failed, to secure new aircraft deals, with Boeing. The decision to resume flights to New York was made on the latest initiative to lease the two new Boeings. bdnew
