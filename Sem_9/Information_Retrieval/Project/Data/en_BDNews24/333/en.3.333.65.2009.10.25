 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com)  Police on Sunday seized office equipment and materials from the Dhaka head office of the recently banned Islamic outfit Hizbut Tahrir. Deputy police commissioner of Motijheel zone Mahid Uddin told reporters, "The papers seized from the office shows that they were very well organised." "We also seized a couple of books on law from the office. It seems they studied the subject." The government banned Hizbut Tahrir operations in Bangladesh last Thursday saying the group was a threat to national safety. Police stopped a press conference by Hizbut Tahrir leaders the next day. Asked about chances of Hizbut Tahrir going underground and conducting attacks, Mahid Uddin said, "The possibility cannot be disregarded. But its members are being kept under close watch." Police raided the banned outfit's head office in Purana Paltan from 11:30am to 3:30pm on Sunday. "The materials are being seized from Hizbut Tahrir's head office with the permission of the court," officer in charge of Paltan Police Station, Mujibur Rahman, told bdnews24.com. A computer, books, posters, files, a cabinet, video camera were seized in the raid. But the hard disk of the computer was not found, said police. "The organisation has been banned in a number of countries, including Turkey because of their involvement with terrorist activities," home secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikder said after issuing the ban on Thursday. "We have also been monitoring their activities for a long time. It seems to us the activities of this organisation threaten national security," Sikder said. Hizb ut Tahrir is the fifth militant organisation to be banned in Bangladesh, according to the home secretary. Mohiuddin Ahmed, coordinator and spokesman of Hizb ut Tahrir in Bangladesh, and associate professor of the Institute of Business Administration, claimed after the ban, "The government has banned us because we have evidence that the government itself had a hand in the Feb 25-26 BDR mutiny." bdnews24
