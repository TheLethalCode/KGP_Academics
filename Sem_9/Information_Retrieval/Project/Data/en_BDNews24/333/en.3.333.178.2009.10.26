 Dhaka, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka gets a taste British curry as the sixth Taste of Britain fusion food festival kicks off in the city Monday. Curry Life Magazine and the Hotel Sheraton are co-hosting the 3-day festival as the UK's curry industry is celebrating its 200th anniversary. Tourism minister GM Quader along with Kevin Ringham, the British High Commission's head of UK Trade & Investment, inaugurated the festival. Four super grade Bangladeshi chefs have flown to Dhaka to give a taste of what was once seen as exotic dining, but is now a part of the British menu. Quader speaking on the occasion said that the country is proud of what the industry has achieved over time. "Though the chefs are mostly British citizens, we do consider them as one of us." Sake Dean Mahomed, who established the Hindustani Coffee House in George Street, London, in 1809, is widely acknowledged as the father of the now booming British industry. In the two centuries since then, the UK curry business has come a long waygrowing into a 4.2 billion sector, with about 12,000 restaurants across the UK, run mainly by British-Bangladeshis. The festival's opening ceremony on Monday also saw the Sheraton Hotel awarded by London-based Curry Life Magazine for being the Best Hospitable Hotel for Non-Resident Bangladeshis. Festival director Syed Belal Ahmed said the award came to recognise the Hotel's support towards NRB initiatives. The minister and the British high commission official handed the award to Dhaka Sheraton's acting general manager Mahfuzur Rahman.
