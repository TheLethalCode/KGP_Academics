 Dhaka, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com)  Government and non-government organisations were urged Tuesday to work together to support Bangladesh's objectives for the Copenhagen climate talks in December. The 15th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP15), scheduled for Dec 7-18 in the Danish capital, invites government representatives and NGOs to participate. "Many NGOs, as well as government agencies, have been working in this sector of late. All of them have to set their objectives ahead of this important conference," Dr. Ainun Nishat told a Consultation Meeting on Climate Change in the capital, jointly organised by the environment ministry and IUCN. World leaders are calling for a comprehensive, ambitious and fair international climate change deal to be agreed in Copenhagen. As environmental groups warn that time is "running out" to reverse the effects of global warming, COP15 aims, crucially, to work towards a new agreement to extend the 1997 Kyoto Protocol that had set emissions cuts up to 2012. Kyoto had set binding targets for greenhouse gas emissions of 37 industrialised countries, though a number of developed countries refused to ratify the protocolmost prominently, the USA. COP15 is expected to push for a deal that includes both major economies such as the US that refused to ratify Kyoto, as well as emerging economies such as India and China that were not required to sign the 1997 protocol. Copenhagen will focus on greater mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, as well as adaptation to climate change, technology transfers and development, and financing, Nishat pointed out. "The results of the Copenhagen conference, will affect vulnerable countries, including Bangladesh, for years to come," said Nishat, a senior adviser on climate change for International Union for Conservation of Nature, Asia. "We have to fix our objectives, on what we will bargain for and what we may achieve from the talks." He said Bangladesh would seek at least one billion dollars a year in adaptation funds to fight the impact of climate change. "But, that is not all. We have to spend this money in the right way. So, again, the government and non-government organisations have to work together." Environment ministry secretary Mihir Kanti Majumder said, "We fear something until it is upon us. Climate change is upon us. So, we have to face up to it now instead of being afraid." "We all have to speak with one voice to address the problem. We also have to realise the responsibility of developed countries in this," said Dr Atiq A. Rahman, executive director of Bangladesh Center for Advanced Studies. The speakers advised the government to include environmentally-responsible components in programmes of all ministries. IUCN Bangladesh's country director Dr. Miaz Ahmed Khan, Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies research director Dr. M Asaduzzaman and chief conservator of forests Abdul Motaleb, among others, spoke at the discussion. bd
