<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com) Chittagong University on Sunday decided to discharge lecturer Fayez Ahmed Chowdhury for 'unethical behaviour' after he was embroiled in a sex scandal for being "caught with four women" in a local building. The university authorities made the decision in a syndicate meeting chaired by vice chancellor Prof. Abu Yusuf. Pro VC Prof. Alauddin and four other syndicate members confirmed the news. Prof Abu Yusuf told bdnews24.com, "Fayez Ahmed Chowdhury has been sacked from his job by the decision of the syndicate as allegation of sexual misconduct against him was proved, and he was convicted by a court." According to university rules, no convicted person could be retained in the job, said Prof Yusuf. According university records, Detective Branch information and an attested copy of court papers, Fayez Ahmed Chowdhury, of CU's international relations department, was arrested on July 21 night after being caught with four women on the ninth floor of Concord Tower in Chatteswari Road. He was charged with 'unethical exercise of sexuality'. After confessing in a local court the next day, Fayez was awarded a fine Tk 200 or three days in jail on failure to pay the fine. CU authorities sent Fayez a notice on Sep 1 to show cause within seven days why he should not be discharged from his job. Fayed did not answer the notice. Sunday's syndicate meeting also warned lecturer Md Shah Alam, of the Islamic history and culture department, for improper attitude and proposition to a female student of his department. bdnews24
