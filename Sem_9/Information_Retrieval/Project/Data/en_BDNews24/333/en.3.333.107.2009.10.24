 Faridpur, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com) - Divers recovered eight more bodies from the Padma River on Saturday taking the death toll to 14 a day after a trawler, with 42 labourers on board, sank at Shaitankhali in Faridpur, police said. One labourer was still unaccounted for, officer in charge at Sadarpur Police Station Naresh Karmaker told reporters. Families and relatives had reported all others who had been missing as safe, he said. At 4pm, Helaluddin Ahmed, deputy commissioner of Faridpur, announced the end of the rescue operation, which had begun the day before, been suspended overnight and resumed again on Saturday morning. The earth-laden trawler capsized early Friday after being hit by another vessel. Six bodies were recovered until 9.30pm Friday and eight others on Saturday. Officials had said 21 labourers were originally missing after the trawler went down. Karmaker said, "There is no confusion over the counts of the missing." "There were 15 men missing, including one still now. We have been confirmed about this after talking with relatives of the missing and others on the trawler." The missing man was identified as 'Sohel', 22, he said. "Divers suspect that violent currents might have washed away his body," said Karmaker. All the bodies recovered had been handed over to their relatives, the local police chief said. The 8 bodies recovered Saturday were identified as those of Altaf Hossain, 20, Kalu Hossain, 24, Bipul Hossain, 20, Daand Zalem, 25, 'Atikul', 22, 'Farhad', 25, 'Ujjal', 23 and 'Azad', 30, all of them day labourers Chatmohar upazila in Pabna. Six bodies recovered on Friday were identified as those of Dudu Miah, 45, 'Doulat', 22, 'Liton', 22, 'Siraj', 25, and 'Wasim', 23, and 'Joni', 22, also from Chatmohor, Pabna. Abdul Alim, a survivor, said the trawler with 42 labourers on board anchored at Shaitankhali on Thursday evening. "The trawler was supposed to leave for Fatullah on Friday. But heavy fog forced it to wait." He said the labourers sleeping on the deck and roof of the trawler were able to swim to safety. Deputy commissioner Helal Uddin told bdnews24.com the rescue operation was brought to an end as no more bodies could be found even after locating the sunken trawler and searching it. "Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority has also been asked for help to raise the sunken trawler," he said. He also said authorities would submit a probe report on the incident to the government as soon as possible. He said a five-member diving team had begun conducting rescue work from 5:30pm on Friday night. He also said strong currents had hampered the recovery work. bdn
