 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com)  The government's revenue collection in the first quarter of the current financial year, was up 9.14 percent, or Tk 220 crore, over the same period the previous year, the NBR chief said on Wednesday. But, he added, there was no significant response over the period to the facility for legalising undeclared income. National Board of Revenue chairman Nasiruddin Ahmed told a press conference the revenue target for the period July-September was Tk 12,188 crore, but collection went over Tk 12,408 crore. Last year, collection over the same period was Tk 11,369 crore, he said. "Because of global recession and fall in import prices on all goods in the international market, revenue under the import head was less than the target. " "But under the heads of income tax and VAT, revenue collection was much greater, thus surpassing the target," said Ahmed. The NBR chief said in the first three months (July-Sept), income tax growth was 25.92 per cent compared with the last fiscal year. The income tax target for these three months was Tk 2,424 crore, but collection was Tk 2,752 crore. VAT collection was over Tk 2,762 crore against a target of Tk 2,693 crore. During the corresponding period of the last fiscal, VAT collection fell by 8.66 percent. On the other hand, target on import tax was Tk 2,336 crore, but collection was only Tk 2282 cror, a decline of 2.25 percent over the previous year. The tax chief said different moves were taken to boost revenue collection. "Along with reform measures, a request has been made to the government to move for realizing Tk 8,000 crore tied up in 18,000 pending tax cases." He said he hoped a good amount would come with the resolution of a big portion of these cases. On the poor response to the undisclosed income facility, he said, "This opportunity is being given for a full one year." "There is still time. Besides, many have legalised previously undisclosed wealth along with their current income tax returns." He said he expected that by the end of the financial year, a significant amount would be realised from the facility. In the current 2009-10 budget, the opportunity to "whiten money" has been offered for homebuyers, and for businessmen with a provision for investment of that money in certain sectors, including readymade garments, agriculture processing industries, textiles, spinning, pharmaceuticals and leather. bd
