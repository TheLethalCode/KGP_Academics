<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)Awami League presidium member Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim MP has alleged that leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia was a part of the "conspiracy" which led to last week's bomb attack on ruling party MP Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh. In an unscheduled discussion in parliament on Thursday, ruling party lawmakers said the bomb attack was not just against a single MP, but an attack on "parliament, democracy, constitution and the war of independence". Taposh, a nephew to Selim as well as the prime minister, came under attack as his car was hit by a bomb blast in the city on Oct 21. "The attack on him is an attack on the country's future democracy as he is the symbol of young generations," Suranjit Sengupta told parliament, sparking an unscheduled discussion after the question-answer session. "This is an attack on the country's democracy, constitutionality, war of independence and parliament," said Sengupta. He said the attack was carried out to disrupt the on-going appeals by the death convicts in the Sheikh Mujibur Rahman assassination trial. Taposh, a lawyer by profession, is a member of the legal team advising the state in the appeals. Sengupta demanded a statement either from the home minister or from the deputy leader of the house on the attack. Three senior MPsSheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, Amir Hossain Amu and Hasanul Haq Inufollowed Sengupta. Sheikh Selim, who is the prime minister's cousin and Taposh's uncle, then took the floor. He blamed BNP founder and former president Ziaur Rahman for protecting the killers of Bangladesh's independence hero Sheikh Mujib, who was assassinated on Aug 15, 1975 in a military putsch. Taposh's parents were also murdered in the bloody coup; his father Sheikh Fazlul Haque Moni was Mujib's nephew. "The attack on Taposh is an attack on parliament and all MPs. No other issue can be more important than this," said Selim, "Khaleda Zia could have issued a statement condemning the attack on Taposh. But she didn't. "Why should she. She is part of the conspiracy on the attack," said Selim, who started bargaining with deputy speaker Col Shawkat Ali who refused to allow a censure motion on the attack without written notice. Selim, like the prime minister and other AL leaders including Taposh himself, also said the attack was aimed at disrupting the trial of the killers of Sheikh Mujib, father of prime minister Sheikh Hasina. "The trial of Bangabandhu's killers must be held on the soil of Bangladesh," said Selim amid desk thumbing of the ruling party MPs. He alleged that Khaleda Zia had been hatching conspiracies to come to power. Amir Hossain Amu also came down heavily on the BNP and its allies. Hasanul Haq Inu heaped praise on Taposh as an AL MP, and urged the government to handle the situation with "an iron hand". A good number of MPs started shouting in favour of adopting a censure motion, but deputy speaker Shawkat Ali was adamant not to hold further debate Thursday as he did not get any prior notice as per the Rules of Procedure. Ali went ahead with the day's businesses and fixed Monday for holding a general discussion on the attack. bdnews24.com/s
