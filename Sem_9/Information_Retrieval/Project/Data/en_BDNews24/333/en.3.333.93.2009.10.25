 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com)None of the accused will be spared if the alleged incident of torture by RAB on the journalist of daily New Age is proved, the home minister has said. "We would not let go of anyone if the charges are proved," Sahara Khatun told reporters at her office on Sunday after attending a meeting of the National Smuggling Protection Committee. The minister said, "It is unfortunate if anything was done unfairly. We're sorry for that," she added. The anticrime force, according to the daily, on Thursday detained F M Masum, its staff correspondent, from his rented house at Jatrabari in Dhaka and severely tortured him in public. They planted six bottles of banned Phensidyl cough syrups on Masum's bed and later retrieved them, they alleged. The RAB later tried to identify him as a drugs dealer keeping him in detention for around 12 hours. Journalists, officials and employees working at the New Age demanded punishment to the perpetrators after a judicial probe. The minister also said she and her deputy will see Masum at the hospital. Flight lieutenant Anisur Rahman, was withdrawn from RAB-10 on Sunday following the incident, the director of Legal and Media wing of the elite force, Abul Kalam Azad, said. Azad told bdnews24.com, "He has been closed to the headquarters and later would be sent back to the Air Force." RAB on Friday said 'sorry' for their torture of New Age journalist, terming it 'unexpected'. It issued a note of apology saying that an untoward incident had taken place as a team of RAB-10 went to an area of Jatrabari in an anti-drug drive at around 12:30pm. "A sincere apology is being offered on behalf of RAB," the statement reads. bdnews24.
