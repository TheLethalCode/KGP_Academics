 Chapainawabganj, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)  Transport strike in Chapainawabganj continued on Thursday severing road communication between the northern district and the rest of the country for the second day. Motor Workers' Union president Fazlul Karim Sheli told bdnews24.com they had talks with the district administration and the bus owners' association Wednesday night. Since no decision could be reached at the meeting the strike is continuing for the second day, he said. All buses, except BRTC buses, did not move from the terminals. Police were deployed at different points of the town. Pickets by striking bus workers were seen taking position at different road crossings. Chapainawabganj Truck-Motor Workers' Union and Truck-Bus Owners' Association called the indefinite strike from Wednesday to press for their seven-point demands, including cancellation of leases of BRTC buses and ban on all illegal transports like 'Nasiman-Kariman', a locally assembled three-wheeler. Owner's Association president Aminul Islam Sentu told bdnews24.com on Wednesday they would expand their strike at all the 16 districts of the northern region if their demands were not met within two days. bd
