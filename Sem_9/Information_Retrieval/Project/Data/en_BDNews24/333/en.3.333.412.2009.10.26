 Dhaka, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com)A pro-BNP teachers and employees group has announced a three-month programme Monday to put pressure on the government to cancel the draft national education policy. Shikkhak Karmachari Oikkyojote (SKO) chief coordinator Selim Bhuiyan announced the organisation's programme in a news conference at Dhaka Reporters Unity office in Dhaka on Monday. They will exchange views with political leaders from Oct 28 to Nov 10, media editors from Nov 11 to Nov 20, lawmakers from Nov 21 to Dec 5, professionals from Dec 6 to Dec 18 and with eminent citizens on Dec 30. They will submit a memorandum to the deputy commissioner on Dec 7 and hold joint triennial conference of SKO, Bangladesh Shikkhak Samity and College Shikkhak Samity (teachers' association) on Jan 19, the National Teachers' Day. "If implemented, the draft education policy will hurt the Islamic religious values. We demand that the prime minister cancel the draft policy and convene a fresh committee of persons acceptable to the people and the teachers of the country," said Bhuiyan. The teachers have not been a party to the proposed policy that has simply ignored them, he claimed. Bhuiyan said, "Lakhs of teachers and employees will lose their livelihood once this policy is enforced. The teachers will oppose the policy at any cost." The SKO chief coordinator said the policy has dropped Islamic Studies from the science and business studies streams syllabi for classes IX and X, which is a "dire blow to the religion of Islam". Because Bangladesh is a Muslim inhabited country, Islamic studies must be included as a compulsory subject for all students studying up to class X, he demanded. b
