<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com) Shakib Al Hasan's brilliant unbeaten century fashioned a seven-wicket victory for Bangladesh to level the five-match ODI series against Zimbabwe at the Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Dhaka on Thursday. The Bangladesh skipper smashed 105 off 69 balls as the Tigers raced to 221-3 in 29.3 overs. Shakib's innings featured 15 fours and three sixes. It was his fourth in international cricket. The home side were given a flying start by Tamim Iqbal and Junaed Siddique before Junaed was caught and bowled by Elton Chigumbura after adding 44 runs in the first four overs. The Tigers suffered a scare when they first lost Tamim (26 off 19 balls) and then Mohammad Ashraful (3) in off successive deliveries before Shakib and Raqibul Hasan (39 off 75 balls) came together to deny the visitors any further spoils. They remained unbeaten after adding 165 runs for the third wicket. Chigumbura was the most successful Zimbabwe bowler with 2-47 while Chamu Chibhabha took one wicket. Speaking at the post-match ceremony, Masakadza: "We started well but it turned out to be a bad day in the office. We just didn't get enough runs. We need more runs. The wicket played very well." Shakib said: "Very happy that we came back so well. Razzak bowled very well and I got some runs. They started well after ten overs and we were worried but we knew our strength was spin and that worked. Ashraful is a key bowler and every time he comes on he gets wickets. We're looking forward to the rest of the series." Razzak: "I'm very happy. In the morning we were on the back foot when they began well but we came back well. There wasn't that much turn but I focused to put the ball on the stumps." Earlier, a career-best five-wicket haul by man-of-match Abdur Razzak restricted Zimbabwe to 219 in 47.2 overs. It is the second time the left-arm spinner, who finished with 5-29, has taken five wickets in a one-day match after acting Zimbabwe skipper Hamilton Masakadza won the toss and elected to bat in the day-night encounter. He and fellow opener Chamu Chibhabha were going along nicely before Naeem Islam made the breakthrough in the 11th over when he trapped Maskadza for 34. They had added 59 runs. The tourists, who won the first of the five-match series by five wickets on Tuesday, then lost three wickets with 96 runs on the board. Razzak grabbed two of them in the same over. His previous best was 5-33 also against the same opponents in December 2006. The other Bangladeshi wicket-takers were Mohammad Ashraful (2-28), Naeem Islam (2-43) and Shakib Al Hasan 1-24. A 54-run stand for the sixth wicket between former skipper Tatenda Taibu (38) and Malcolm Waller (40) was the feature of the Zimbabwe innings. The third match is at the same venue on Satur
