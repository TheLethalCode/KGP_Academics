<TITLE> US backs 'carbon financing' in Bangladesh </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com)  The US has suggested Bangladesh use 'carbon financing' in its fight against the impact of climate change. Wednesday saw the inauguration of a two-day workshop in Dhaka on 'Global Climate Change and Carbon Financing: Opportunities for Bangladesh', supported by USAID. The workshop aims to explore opportunities for carbon financing as a means to reduce emissions, increase adaptation and improve land-use to alleviate poverty and conserve biodiversity in Bangladesh, one of the countries most at risk from climate change. The US says 80 percent of future carbon emissions will be produced by developing countries, which appears to be backed by data in recent years that say China has overtaken the US as the world's biggest greenhouse gas emitter. Neither the US nor China are signatories to the only international treaty on binding emissions cuts, the Kyoto Protocol. State minister for environment and forest Hasan Mahmud inaugurated the workshop on Wednesday, saying, "Vulnerable developing countries will be first to be affected by climate change. But developed countries will not escape the effects for long. So we will have to work together to face this crisis." US ambassador James F Moriarty, addressing the inauguration, said, "Bangladesh could use carbon financing to invest in greenhouse gas emission reduction projects to support the conservation and co-management of Protected Areas and other natural resources in the country." "Due to poverty, Bangladesh is unable to fight this war against climate change in various aspects. We would be able to overcome this lacking with the help of US and other donor countries." He said the US and its people would always be besides Bangladesh in fighting climate change and other environmental issues. "We will support other nations as they adapt to the problems that climate change causes while helping them travel a path of clean development." Moriarty said his government was "always conscious of fighting climate change and environmental disasters". But, he claimed, over 80 percent of future greenhouse gas emissions will come from developing countries. "Recently president Barak Obama declared his intention to cut US carbon emissions by 17 percent within 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. The US recognises that while strong domestic action is necessary, it would not be sufficient to reduce carbon emissions. This is a crisis that demands a global solution," said Moriarty. "As part of a series of activities to improve the environment, we are working with other donors to help restore forest lands in Bangladesh. We will collaborate on other ways to decrease carbon emissions in the region." He said plans call for managing emissions, reducing vulnerability, and increasing adaptation to the effects of climate change. "The US encourages developing countries to create low-carbon development plans." "We know that without emission reductions by both developed and emerging economies, no solution to climate change is possible. Moving to a clean energy economy and achieving a strong international climate change agreement is in the best interest of the US, Bangladesh, and the world." He expressed his confidence in various projects in Bangladesh. "I am confident that with these supports, the government of Bangladesh and local communities will make excellent progress in the months ahead." "New sources of carbon financing will contribute to the world's efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change," said Moriarty. The workshop was organised by USAID's Integrated Protected Area Co-management (IPAC) project and the United States Forest Service in partnership with the Bangladesh government, Jahangirnagar University and the Independent University of Bangladesh USAID supports programmes in Bangladesh to improve health and pre-primary education, create sources of income for rural poor, develop governance, food security, and face natural disasters
