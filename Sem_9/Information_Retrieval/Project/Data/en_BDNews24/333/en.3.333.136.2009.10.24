 Dhaka, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com)--The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has joined the government in a coordinated rehabilitation campaign for the cyclone Aila affected areas of the south-western districts. Agriculture minister Matia Chowdhury and FAO representative in Bangladesh Ad Spijkers distributed agricultural inputs to the poorest of the victims of the cyclone in two southern upazilas on Saturday, according to a press release. Shyamnagar of Satkhira and Koira of Khulna, where the distribution took place, are the most remote and among the worst hit by the cyclone that hit the southern coast on May 25. "We will do our level best to get the farmers back on their feet", said Chowdhury, referring to areas also troubled by salinity intrusion. "We are introducing saline tolerant rice variety (BR 47), maize, cow pea, water melon that are salinity resistant." The input support of 50 tons of rice seeds, vegetable seeds and the required amount of fertilizers (urea, MOP and TSP) was given under FAO's own funded Aila Rehabilitation programme. "The south has tremendous potential for agricultural growth and supporting the national economy" commented the FAO representative while speaking to a large audience both in Shyamnagar and Koira. "Good seeds produce good crop, and we are to ensure good agricultural practices including the use of balanced fertilisers", he added. Spijkers added that quality seeds were matched by adequate quantity of the appropriate fertilizers under the ongoing agricultural support programme. The FAO representative also pointed to the fact that these are the areas having the least attention from development supports though being one of the poorest zones. The joint entourage of the government and FAO also observed the precarious conditions of the damaged embankments as well as the hardships of the water-logged populations in the remote south at the fringe of the Sundarbans. "Urgent actions will be taken by the government with or even without the support of the donors for repairing the damaged structures" announced Chowdhury. "No leniency to corruption would be shown to the responsible agencies" the minister was quoted as saying in the FAO media release. She also urged the MPs to ensure removal of any unruly elements even in the own cadre. The distribution ceremony in Koira was also addressed by Monnuzan Sufian, state minister for labour and employment and the local MPs. "The MPs should come forward with pragmatic steps to implement the programmes" Sufian said. The speakers emphasised a fair and transparent delivery mechanism for the planned support. Timely delivery of the interventions was underscored for the early and sustained recovery of the long-suffering rural poor of these remote localities. The events were attended by FAO international and national staff, and relevant government agencies. FAO also pledged their continued support for the development of the so
