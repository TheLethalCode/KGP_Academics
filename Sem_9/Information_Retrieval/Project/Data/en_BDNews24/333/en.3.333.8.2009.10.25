<TEXT>
 Naogaon, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com)Abdul Jalil said on Saturday that misunderstandings had been created over his recent statements, causing unwarranted controversy. He said there would be no benefit from any "propaganda or conspiracy against him". Speaking at a local AL rally in Naogaon, he said he had always been with Awami League and always would be. "I have faith in the ideology of Bangabandhu and the leadership of Sheikh Hasina. That is why I was made the general secretary of the party and commerce minister in the past. I have been with AL since 1955, and will be with AL life long." Jalil , MP for Naogaon-5, was speaking at a party rally at JR Market premises. The rally was originally scheduled to take place at the town's Naozowan grounds at 3pm. But the administration imposed a Section 144 ban on public gatherings at the place of the rally as another pro-AL organisation, the Awami Sechchhashebok League, called a meeting at the same venue at the same time. He expressed his anger over the Section 144 ban in his seven minute-long speech. "This is part of a conspiracy against me. But I'll not complain against anyone as I am on the government's side too." "I will be in politics under the leadership of Sheikh Hasina and for the attainment of democracy until death." He condemned last Wednesday's bomb attack on AL MP Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh, "The killers of Bangabandhu are linked with this attack," he said echoing other Awami League leaders including top government figures and Taposh himself. "The attack was meant to postpone the final proccedings of Bangabandhu murder case." District AL leader Nirmal Krishna Shaha and district Chhatra League leader Tajul Islam Tota were among those present. But neither president of AL's district chapter Fazle Rabbi nor any MPs of Naogaon constituencies were present. Jalil, earlier this month, was granted anticipatory bail from the High Court in a tax evasion case. The veteran politician has become a controversial figure within the ruling partyousted from its higher ranks as well as being removed as the chair of a parliamentary standing committeefollowing outspoken comments about his own party and its leaders, including the prime minister, which sparked a political storm in recent weeks. Naogaon police superintendent Mofazzal Hossain told bdnews24.com one Lokman Hossain, introducing himself as the president of Naogaon town's Sechchhashebok League unit, sought permission to hold a procession at Naozowan ground. "I informed the district commissioner about the matter and a Section 144 was imposed to avert any untoward situation at the ground and its surrounding area as another rally was planned for the same place and time," he added. But convener of the district Sechchhashebok League Nasim Ahmed told bdnews24.com, "I don't know any Sechchhashebok League leader by the name of Lokman Hossain." Sechchhashebok League acting general secretary Nirmal Krishna refused to speak on the issue. bdnews24.co
