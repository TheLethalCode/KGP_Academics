 Dhaka, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com)  BNP leader Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury MP has termed the incidents of Aug 15, 1975 and Oct 28, 2006 as the "turning points for politics of the country". "The terrible incident of Aug 15 would not have taken place if Awami League had remained attached to its ideals," he said at a roundtable at the National Press Club on Monday. The party was diverted from its ideals through "a one-party ruling system", he said. "In the same way the people of this country lost their voting rights through the carnage  on Oct 28, 2006," he said at the roundtable commemorating those who died in the political violence that erupted on that day. The roundtable, titled 'The politics of conspiracy and what the patriotic should do', was organised by the National Youth Forum. "The people then remained deprived of their voting rights for two years and had to put up with the kicks of the boots of the sentries salaried by the money of the people," he said. He also criticised the present government's "favouritism" and failure in maintaining law and order. "On one hand, history is in the making in the Supreme Court. On the other, an attempt is made on the life of a ruling party MP is going on." "At the same time, Bir Bikram Swapan has been taken into police custody only because his brother is linked to the incident of Aug 15. For the same reason, a woman was taken into remand with her child," he said, referring to the recent arrests of family members of Aug 15 convicts in connection with the bomb attack on Awami League MP Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh. "Such things indicate the government is suffering from insecurity. In this situation, it need hardly be said that the plight of the general people is much worse," said Chowdhury. Saying that AL had formed a government in "an unnatural way through an unnatural vote" he warned, "It is hardly likely that this government will be able to leave by a natural process." b
