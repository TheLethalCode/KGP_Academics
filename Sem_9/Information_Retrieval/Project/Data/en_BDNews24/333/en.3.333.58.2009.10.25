 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka University syndicate sent associate professor Mohiuddin Ahmed, spokesman and chief coordinator of the banned Hizbut Tahrir, on compulsory leave from Sunday until further notice "to maintain peace on campus". "We considered three factors before the decisionsreports in the newspapers, his involvement with a banned organisation and his impression on the students and teachers," said vice-chancellor Prof AAMS Arefin Siddique. "Then we took the decision to keep him out of the campus," he told reporters after the syndicate meeting. Asked about measures against other teachers with possible links to the now banned outfit, Siddique replied, "The university authority will decide on it after further investigation. The government is also looking into the matter." But, he said, this step against Mohiuddin should not be seen as a "punishment". "We find it's needed to maintain peace in the campus." "This decision should not be used as a reference while taking any measures against him later," he added. The government banned Hizbut Tahrir in Bangladesh on Oct 22, saying the Islamist outfit posed a threat to national security. Home minister Sahara Khatun had told bdnews24.com, ""We had kept the outfit under watch for a long time. We made the decision based on a final report from intelligence agencies." The following day, Dhaka University said it would take measures against Mohiuddin, if he continued being involved with the disbanded Islamist outfit. "We have to see now if Mr Mohiuddin is still involved with the organisation. We will definitely take steps against him if he is involved," vice-chancellor Arefin Siddique told bdnews24.com last Friday. "Any teacher of Dhaka University can take part independently in any political activities. Mr Mohiuddin has so far done no more than that," he said. "But now it is something else since the government has disbanded his organisation." The warning from the VC came after Mohiuddin, an associate professor at the university's Institute of Business Administration, had been mentioned as chief coordinator of the organisation in a press release. Police had foiled a news conference called at Mohiuddin's house on IBA Compound, Green Road, earlier Friday. The group, nevertheless, issued a press statement on the day, reading "The Hizb ut-Tahrir will continue its movement with the Muslim Ummah". Speaking to bdnews24.com in 2007, Mohiuddin said Hizbut Tahrir has around 1000 activists in Bangladesh and more than 10,000 supporters. He also said, "We don't support the current election system which only brings changes to leadership. It doesn't change the ideology or the government's stance." "So the government must be changed or uprooted through mass-upheaval." Bangladesh Bank on Sunday instructed all banks to freeze accounts of the recently banned Hizb ut-Tahrir for one month, giving the order under the Anti Terrorism Act. Police on Sunday also raided and seized office equipment, including computers and other materials, from the Dhaka head quarters and Sylhet office of the now banned outfit.
