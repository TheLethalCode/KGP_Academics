 RAMALLAH, West Bank, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli-Palestinian peace talks are unlikely to resume in the near future, Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said on Monday, blaming Israel for the impasse and urging Washington to do the same. "The gap is still wide and Israel does not give a single sign of meeting its obligations under the road map, halting settlement activities and resuming negotiations where they left off," he told Voice of Palestine radio. "I do not see any possibility for restarting peace talks in the near future," he said, in an assessment echoed by Israeli government officials. The U.S.-backed peace "road map" of 2003, which charts a course to Palestinian statehood, commits Israel to halting settlement activity in the occupied West Bank. "If President (Barack) Obama's administration cannot make Israel abide by its commitments, it has to announce that Israel is the party that is obstructing the launching of peace negotiations," Erekat said, referring the road map agreements. Resisting U.S. pressure to comply, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled out a complete cessation of construction within settlements, saying the needs of growing settler families must be accommodated. Israel also accuses Palestinians of failing to meet their road map commitments to curb violence and incitement against Israel, notably by Hamas Islamists who control the Gaza Strip. LAND FOR PEACE Netanyahu has rejected Palestinian demands to abide by what they said were land-for-peace understandings reached with his predecessor, Ehud Olmert, in a year of negotiations that followed a U.S.-sponsored peace conference in November 2007. Israeli government officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said talks with the Palestinians were unlikely in the coming months. They expressed doubt that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas could show flexibility toward Israel before planned Palestinian elections in January, opposed by Hamas. Netanyahu has called on Abbas to resume negotiations immediately without preconditions. On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gave Obama a less-than-glowing assessment of Middle East peace efforts. Her report followed separate meetings in Washington between Obama's Middle East envoy George Mitchell and Israeli and Palestinian negotiators aimed at narrowing the gap and restarting direct talks suspended since December. Obama is sending Mitchell back to the region for a fresh attempt at restarting peace talks, and Clinton would consult Arab foreign ministers on the subject in Morocco on November 2 and 3, a U.S. administration official said last week. Few analysts believe there is a high risk of Palestinian frustration turning into a new uprising of the kind seen in the years of Intifada from 2000. However, clashes between youths and Israeli police around Jerusalem's al-Aqsa mosque, most recently on Sunday, have aroused concerns about instability.
