<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary watchdog has recommended a law for fining anyone, including ministers and MPs, for breaking traffic rules. The parliamentary standing committee on planning ministry at its meeting on Wednesday also suggested the police take necessary measures to stop haphazard parking of vehicles to reduce traffic congestion in Dhaka and Chittagong. "Many people flout rules and create traffic jams. "Be it a minister or an MP or ordinary people, there should be a provision of fine of Tk 1,000 for violation of traffic rules," said the written recommendations obtained by bdnews24.com. The committee said the authorities should cancel the driving licences of the drivers who would repeatedly violate traffic rules. It also said some local leaders and activists of every ruling party act as brokers at police stations. "These leaders and activists harass people by filing false charges against their political opponents. They extract money from them and wreak their personal vengeance on them. "This practice must stop," said one of the recommendations of the committee meeting. Committee chairman Oli Ahmad did not talk to reporters.
