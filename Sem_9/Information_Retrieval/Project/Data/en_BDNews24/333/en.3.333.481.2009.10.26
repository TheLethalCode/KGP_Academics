<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com)The High Court on Monday ruled illegal last year's dismissal order of Prof MA Tahir who was vice-chancellor of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University. The bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Kamrul Islam gave the order upon a petition submitted by Tahir. The government removed Tahir on Nov 4, 2008, following allegations of irregularities, including a forged medical certificate for former BNP lawmaker Mosaddak Ali Falu so he could be transferred from jail to hospital. Tahir later filed a petition on Nov 18 challenging legality of his dismissal. On Nov 23, the HC issued a rule nisi upon government to show cause as to why the dismissal should not be declared illegal. Barrister Rafiq-ul-Haque participated Monday's High Court hearing for Tahir. After the verdict, Haque said, "It was an unfair decision. The HC has ruled the removal 'illegal' which has brought a moral victory for Tahir." bdnews24
