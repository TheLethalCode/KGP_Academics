 Dhaka,Oct26(bdnews26(bdnews24)BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain termed a money-laundering case filed Monday by the Anticorruption Commission against Tarique Rahman, elder son of party chairperson Khaleda Zia, "false and baseless" "It is crystal clear that fresh charges are being framed against party leaders in a bid to annihilate BNP," Delwar told bdnews24.com. He demanded immediate withdrawal of the 'false case.' "The case has been filed only to undermine him politically." "Similarly, the last care-taker government, predecessor of the present government was involved in tarnishing the image of BNP leaders," said Delwar. Cautioning the government, he said, "BNP cannot be suppressed by such attacks and filing cases." "If the government does not stop oppression and suppression, we will be forced to launch a mass movement." Delwar alleged that cases filed against Awami League leaders had been quahed one after one while charges against the opposition leaders are not being frozen. ACC assistant director Mohammad Ibrahim filed the money-laundering case against Tarique and his friend and business partner Giasuddin Al Mamun earlier in the day. Dhaka Cantonment police chief Hosne Ara Begum, quoting the case details, told bdnews24.com that Tarique and Mamun are accused of smuggling Tk 20.4 crore (Tk 204 million) from Bangladesh to Singapore in violation the Money Laundering Act. ACC assistant director Ibrahim told bdnews24.com that Mamun received the money in exchange for awarding a work contract for a proposed 80MW power plant at Tongi. The amount was deposited to a Citi N.A. account in Singapore. "Tarique is also accused as he was also a beneficiary of the money," Ibrahim said. bdne
