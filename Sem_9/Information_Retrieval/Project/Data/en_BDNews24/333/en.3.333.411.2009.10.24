 Dhaka, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong Medical College closed it doors until further notice on Saturday after pro-ruling party Chhatra League and pro Jamaat-e-Islami Chhatra Shibir clashed violently on campus. Male students were directed to leave campus by 8pm, female students by 8am Sunday, principal Gofranul Haque said. "The violence was sparked between Chhatra League and Shibir at around 3:30pm over bringing freshers into their organisations," he said. The rioting students, some with faces concealed behind hoods and masks, torched 15 rooms and further vandalised over 50. Police were forced to charge with batons and fire tear gas shells to bring the situation under control. Authorities and student leaders said students were injured but could not give a count immediately. Students said Chhatra League brought out a parade for newly admitted first year students to encourage them to join their numbers. Chhatra Shibir countered with a procession of its own. Heated arguments were exchanged between members of the two organisations leading to chase and counter-chase. Both organisations later held rallies inside a hostel, at which point violent fighting broke out. Sub-inspector of Panchlaish police Abdullah Al Mamun told bdnews24.com that the situation was eventually brought under control as adequate numbers of police were deployed. bdnews24.
