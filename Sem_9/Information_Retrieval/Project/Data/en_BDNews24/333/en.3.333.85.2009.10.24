<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com)  The government is moving to introduce a digital system to track the state of cases in the higher and trial courts, the law minister said on Saturday. "We are going to introduce a digital system for the convenience of justice seekers from the highest court to the trial courts and in court management," Shafique Ahmed said at the launch of a workshop. "Both the judge and justice seeker will be able to know by just the flick of a switch the progress of a case," he said in the workshop on Alternative Dispute Resolution organised by BILIA in the capital. The government is also mulling ways to make the provision of Alternative Dispute Resolution more effective to reduce the burden on courts, said Shafique. Delays in processing cases also incur huge losses for the government, he said. As much as Tk 7,729 crore in revenue remains held up through 19,691 tax cases in the courts. "These cases can be quickly resolved through ADR," Shafique said. Cases are mounting as population increases, the minister said. "To resolve some of the mounting cases ADR will play a crucial role." He also conceded that there is a paucity of courtrooms and judges. "Cases remain pending for various reasons. Disputes can also be resolved if two parties can be brought to a mutual understanding." "Resolution has now become a popular means of settling cases, it already exists as a system in rural arbitration," he said. Bangladesh Institute of Law and International Affairs' executive director Waliur Rahman, justice Amirul Haque and barrister M Amir-ul-Islam also spoke, among others. bd
