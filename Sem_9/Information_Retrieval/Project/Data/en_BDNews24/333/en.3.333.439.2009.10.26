 Dhaka, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com)--An anonymous letter on Monday threatened attorney general Mahbubey Alam and his family with death if convicts in the Bangabandhu murder case were not released in 15 days. The letter was sent to his office in the afternoon. "Attorney general Mahbubey Alam. The convicts of Mujib murder case are behind bars unjustly. You along with your family will be dead if they are not released within 15 days," Alam quoted the letter as saying. The police have been informed of the matter, he said. Asked who he thought had sent the letter, Alam told bdnews24.com: "I think someone from the lawyers group that roam around the [Supreme Court] premises might have sent the letter. "Most people wrongly spell my name. They spelled my name correctly. "That means they know the correct spelling of my name," he said. On the reason behind the threat he said: "I am running a number of crucial cases. Some of them are against BNP leaders. "I am arguing in a case against main opposition chief Khaleda Zia. Many attempts were made to keep me away from pursuing the case. "I think I have been threatened for these reasons," the attorney general added. Last Wednesday, ruling Awami League MP Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh, also one of the lawyers advising the state in the appeals proceedings of the Sheikh Mujibur Rahman assassination case, saw his car hit by a bomb blast when he was leaving his Motijheel office. A five-judge Appellate Division bench headed by Justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam is currently hearing the appeals by the death convicts to overturn the judgement of the High Court. Of the 12 death convicts, five appealed against the High Court judgement in the Appellate Division. The detained death convicts are dismissed Lt Col Syed Faruk Rahman, retired Lt Col Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, retired Lt Col Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery), retired Major Bazlul Huda and retired Lt Col A K M Mohiuddin (lancer). bd
