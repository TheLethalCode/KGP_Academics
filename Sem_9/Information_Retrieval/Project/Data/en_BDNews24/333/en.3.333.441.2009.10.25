<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com)A Supreme Court lawyer on Sunday served a legal notice on Square and Apollo hospitals to stop charging VAT from patients in 24 hours. Manjil Morshed warned them of contempt of court proceedings if they do not oblige. He enclosed with the notice the High Court ruling that declared the realisation unlawful. Sunday's legal notice said the High Court order had been covered well by the media, but only a few hospitals and diagnostic centres care to comply with it. The court on July 14 also ruled that it was a violation of the constitution if the service providers charge Value Added Tax (VAT) on fees for consultation, pathological and other diagnostic tests. The lawyer on Sep 27 slapped legal notices on 16 city hospitalsincluding top ones like Apollo, United and Squarefor allegedly charging VAT from patients violating the High Court order. The list of "culprits" included City Hospital, Compath Ltd, Modern Diagnostic Center, Popular, Shomorita, Medinova, LabAid, Central, Delta, Brighton, Comfort, Monowara and Ibn Sina. The court order came on a writ petition filed on Feb 15 by three citizens Julhas Uddin Ahammad, Md Abdul Bari and Golam Mostafa. Morshed had told bdnews24.com later that he would sue these hospitals for contempt of court if they did not stop in the next three days. The petitioners had stated that health service consumers were being overcharged for treatment as a result of the application of VAT. "Although service providers are supposed to pay VAT in line with Section 3 of the 1991 VAT Act, the tax was also being realised from patients," said Morshed, the counsel for the petitioners. "This is contrary to the constitution," he said. bd
