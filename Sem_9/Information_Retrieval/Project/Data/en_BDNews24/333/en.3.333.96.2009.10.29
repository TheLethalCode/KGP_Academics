<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)Grameenphone's revenue grew 10 percent in the third quarter of 2009 compared with the same period of last year, the company said. The largest mobile-phone operator of the country at a news conference on Thursday also said that their customer base was hovering around 22 million as the quarter added almost one million new subscribers. A statement released by the company says revenues for the quarter stood at Tk 16.5 billion from Tk 15 billion in third quarter of 2008. According to GP, higher subscription base, higher average price per minute and revenue from international gateway (IGW) introduced from the fourth quarter of 2008 drove the growth. GP's chief executive Oddvar Hesjedal told the media briefing at its Gulshan headquarters that the market has just crossed the 50 million subscription mark and the GP serves the largest chunk, almost 44 percent. "It pleases me that we have been successful in adding a significant amount of the new subscriptions to the market in the last quarter, which indicates that Grameenphone is the preferred service provider," Hesjedal said. He, however, pointed that the growth rate of subscriptions fell as the third quarter of 2008 added about 6.5 million subscriptions. But it has been offset by the growing revenue, the CEO added. The GP top official also urged for a cut or removal of the Tk 800 SIM tax. "It would help the economy recover sooner because internet and telecommunication penetration generates faster economic activity and community development." Asked what would be an acceptable SIM tax, Hesjedal said a moderate tax rate would be Tk 300. Meanwhile, the earnings before tax of the company surged to 57 percent from the same period of last year at 48.9 percent. The jump has been due to higher revenue, combined with lower network operation and maintenance costs, reads the statement. Capital expenditure was also lower during this quarter, in accordance with the current traffic demand, it said. bd
