 BRATISLAVA, Oct 23, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen urged member states on Friday to support the strategy of the top US and alliance commander in Afghanistan for combating the Taliban insurgency. General Stanley McChrystal was due to brief ministers from the 28 NATO member states in the Slovak capital, Bratislava, on his strategy and a call for more resources in Afghanistan. Rasmussen said he hoped the ministers would make clear whether they backed McChrystal's assessment of how to handle the worsening insurgency and accelerate training of Afghan security forces. "There should be no doubt about our determination to fulfil this mission, and we should remain as long as possible in order to succeed," Rasmussen told the meeting. "In order to succeed, we must help Afghanistan become sufficiently solid in order to withstand the insurgency. Because that is the only way to fight against terrorism." NATO's Afghan mission currently involves 65,000 US troops and 39,000 from allied nations. US President Barack Obama is still considering a call by McChrystal for tens of thousands more soldiers, so no decisions on troop levels were expected at the ministers' meeting. Rasmussen said it was necessary to show the increasingly sceptical public in NATO troop-contributing nations that Western forces would be handing over responsibility to Afghan troops "sooner rather than later". "I firmly believe that if we show people in our countries that we are making progress, that there is light at the end of the tunnel, they will support us as long as it takes," he said. Rasmussen called on Thursday for greater efforts to train, equip and finance Afghan forces, warning that inaction would have serious consequences for stability in the region and in NATO member states. GATES TO ADVISE OBAMA FIRST ON TROOPS Obama said on Wednesday he could reach a decision on his new Afghan war strategy before the outcome of an Afghan election run-off on Nov. 7. Afghan President Hamid Karzai removed a stumbling block to Obama's decision when he agreed on Tuesday to a second round of voting after many of his votes in the August presidential election were thrown out as fraudulent. "The legitimacy of the government is key, and then the decision by President Obama," said Dutch Defence Minister Eimert Van Middelkoop. He said he did not expect any new NATO troop pledges until NATO foreign ministers meet in early December, adding: "I think most countries are waiting for the Americans." Danish Defence Minister Soren Gade Jensen said he expected any future troop pledges to be linked to the performance of the new Afghan government. Diplomats say most European NATO states remain reluctant to send more troops because of public worries about rising casualties, and that Washington would have to contribute heavily to an increase, despite the fact that support in the United States is also wan
