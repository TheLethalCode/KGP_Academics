<TITLE> India's Yuvraj doubtful for first Australia one-dayer </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 VADODARA, India, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Explosive India batsman Yuvraj Singh is a doubt for their opening one-day international against Australia on Sunday after failing to recover from a finger injury. Hard-hitting left-hander Yuvraj, who missed this month's Champions Trophy with a broken finger, had been named in the 15-player squad in the hope he would be fit to start the series between the world's top two ranked sides. "All I can say is that Yuvraj will surely be available for the second match," India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni told a news conference on Saturday ahead of the seven-match series against the world champions. India suffered an injury scare to the skipper as well as batsman Suresh Raina at practice, but Dhoni said they were just niggles. Australia, who won a second successive Champions Trophy, have been weakened by injuries to leading players. Batsman Michael Clarke was forced to withdraw from the Champions Trophy with a back injury, while first choice wicketkeeper Brad Haddin is undergoing rehabilitation after finger surgery and left-arm paceman Nathan Bracken (knee) is also out. Australia won a one-day series 4-2 on their previous visit two years ago. The other matches will be played in Nagpur (October 28), New Delhi (October 31), Mohali (November 2), Hyderabad (November 5), Guwahati (November 8) and Mumbai (November 11).
