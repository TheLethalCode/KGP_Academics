<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)China, which introduced tea to the world, wants to import it as one of the few products from Bangladesh to reduce huge trade gap. "We pay great attention to this. There is trade imbalance of bilateral trade in favour of China," ambassador Zhang Xianyi said at a media briefing at the Dhaka Reporters' Unity auditorium on Thursday, "We want to import more from Bangladesh. I travel to different parts of the country to find out what more products we can buy from Bangladesh to reduce the gap," said Xianyi. "We buy 10 percent of Bangladesh's jute exportable jute and jute products. "We can buy frozen sea food, tea, leather products and textile from Bangladesh," he added. The volume of bilateral trade between Bangladesh and China stood at $4.7 billion in 2008over $4 billion in China's favour. Bangladesh's exports to China is below $300 million a year. The envoy said China wanted to be connected with Chittagong via Myanmar. "We want to connect with Chittagong, Cox's Bazar via Ghundhum (Bangladesh-Myanmar border area)," said Xianyi who took as office as ambassador in March this year. He said the proposed Bangladesh-Myanmar-China highway was under consideration of the three governments and the project would come into reality only when the three governments were "ready" to implement it. The envoy said his government was constructing highways up to its border with Myanmar. The envoy said China wanted to get connected with all of its neighbours through land and water routes. Bangladesh and Myanmar on July 27, 2007 singed a memorandum of understanding on construction of cross-boundary road styled "Bangladesh-Myanmar Friendship Road" starting from Teknaf in Cox's Bazar district. The ultimate vision of constructing the 25-milomtre road is to connect Bangladesh with China's Yunan province capital Kunming via Myanmar. Dhaka has also proposed that China build a road connecting Bangladesh with China via Myanmar, to which Beijing has responded positively. "Bangladesh-Myanmar-China road is still on the table. All governments are positive about the project. "When the time is mature, the countries are ready, the road will be constructed," said Xianyi. Bangladesh-Myanmar relations The Chinese envoy said, quoting foreign minister Dipu Moni, there was no tension in Bangladesh-Myanmar border. "Both the neighbours of Bangladesh are peace loving. "There may be disputes with the neighbours. I think the only way to solve the disputes is to hold talks with mutual respect," said Xianyi. China backs the military junta in the reclusive Buddhist-majority Myanmar that has been quelling a long pro-democracy struggle led by detained opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. He said Bangladesh-China relations were "friendly and time-tested". "The existing relations between Bangladesh and China is stable," said the envoy.
