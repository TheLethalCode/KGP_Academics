The North has made a series of conciliatory gestures in recent months that have eased tension in north Asia, a region responsible for about one-sixth of the global economy. The North had cut ties with Lee in anger at his halting of unconditional handouts and insistence that aid be linked to nuclear disarmament. The South's assistance was once equal to about 5 percent of the North's annual economy. The two Koreas are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended with a cease fire and not a peace treaty.
