<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com)A five-member probe committee was formed Sunday following violent clashes between medical students of Chhatra League and Chhatra Shibir that forced Chittagong Medical College to close its doors indefinitely the day before. The committee headed by CMC vice principal Dr Aminuddin has been asked to submit its investigation report within the next 15 days, said principal Dr Gofranul Haque. The CMC principal told bdnews24.com that the students had left the campus after the college and its dormitories were declared closed following the bloody clashes. First year MBBS admissions, however, are ongoing despite the student riots and closures, Haque said. Additional police have been posted in and around the hostels and the campus, he said. Losses to the CMC and its hostels in the Saturday riots are yet to be assessed, he added. Violence sparked between Chhatra League and Shibir at around 3:30pm Saturday over recruiting fresher students into their organisations. The rioting students, some with faces concealed behind hoods and masks, torched some 15 rooms and further vandalised over 50. Police were forced to charge with batons and fire tear gas shells to bring the situation under control. Authorities and student leaders said at least 15 were injured during the two hours of violence that. Other members of the probe committee are professors Dr Anwar Hossain, Dr Mohibullah, Dr Zillur Rahman and Dr Saroj Kumar Majumder. bd
