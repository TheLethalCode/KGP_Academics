"All jails in the country have been on red alert since midnight of Oct 21," inspector general of prisons Brig Gen Ashraful Islam Khan told bdnews24.com. A circular, published on Oct 21the night of the bomb attack on Awami League MP Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposhbecame effective from Oct 22, he said. "The directive is still in effect," he added.

But there was no official mention of a "red alert". Sahara had told bdnews24.com, "The government was already conscious of security issues from the start of the appeals proceedings on Oct 5." She said law enforcing agencies, including RAB and police, had been given directions to be "more alert". She said security had been tightened at all key points and installations, including jails, in the capital and around the country. Khulna district commissioner NM Ziaul Alam told bdnews24.com on Monday, "The red alert was declared in fear of terrorist attacks following Hizbut Tahrir's ban last Thursday (Oct 22)." He said, the red alert has been imposed, in line with jail authority directives, inside the district prison, while reinforcement of security measures inside and outside prison premises has been tightened. Supervisor of Khulna district prison M Shah Alam Khan told bdnews24.com special drills for prevention of terrorist attacks and controlling prisoner riots were held Monday afternoon with 150 prison guards taking part. "The red alert has been declared to face attacks on the jail. Protective measures inside and outside the prison have been increased," Khan said. He said he had 1,900 prisoners. "Of them five are Hizbut Tahrir members and six are JMB members. Twelve prisoners are awaiting the death penalty by hanging and around 100 are serving life sentences." Khan also said ten additional police have been added to the normal prison guard force. "Other than this RAB is conducting regular patrols. Vehicles and pedestrians in streets around the prison are being searched." "The prison guards are on the highest possible alert to prevent any sort of attack." bdnews24.com/c
