 Dhaka, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com)Finance minister A M A Muhith on Monday called for immediate activation of the SAARC food bank to guarantee food security in the region in view of the global food crisis Muhith gave the call from a two-day symposium titled 'Food security: the role of the SAARC central banks' he inaugurated, organised by Bangladesh Bank. "Almost all global nations today face food insecurity in the face of climate change all over. "Poverty reduction programmes also suffer grievously due to the same menace and this reality presents the SAARC Food Bank as a necessity which, if rendered effective, may prove a great boon," said the minister. The food bank will act as a regional food security reserve for the SAARC member countries during normal time food shortages and emergencies. It will provide regional support to national food security efforts, foster inter-country partnerships and regional integration, and solve regional food shortages through collective action. The agreement to establish the food bank was adopted by the SAARC during its 14th summit in New Delhi in April 2007. A decision was taken in the 2005 SAARC summit held in Dhaka to implement the food bank, but to no avail. India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bangladesh have endorsed the agreement, "Once fully commissioned, the SAARC Food Bank will enhance mutual trust among the member countries. It should help effectively in ensuring the regional food security," Muhith said. "Currently, the SAARC Food Bank is only a name as no SAARC country saves food in the bank. Therefore, no nation gets any food aid from the bank when necessary," he pointed out. The finance minister said, "We don't lack either in goodwill or sincerity in rendering SAARC effective, as Bangladesh had been the pioneer behind SAARC formation." Those who lack goodwill are two or three larger nations. SAARC will be most effective when they should mind the business. "SAARC food bank also can be made functional which is a necessity these days." He said, "The climate change manifestations are not only hampering our food security, they are challenging economic growth and investments, forcing nations to face myriad vulnerabilities." Muhith called upon the SAARC nations to work jointly to combat the threats due to the climate change. Recalling the 2008 global food scarcity and high prices, Muhith said, "Our foreign exchange reserves faced depletion then as we had to import additional foodgrains." "We have overcome that crisis. We have sufficient food stocks and the central bank reserves have also been rebuilt. "I consider the SAARC food bank a necessity more in the light of the 2008 experience." Describing the backdrop of Bangladesh, the minister said, "We have had the recent good luck of harvesting two-three bumper crops without any disaster affecting us. "But we failed to pay the farmers even their dues which is a hard and complicated reality for us." Attempting to explain the rationale of the symposium, Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman said ensuring food security has now to be treated with more urgency due to climate change affecting all nations. The SAARC country central bank officials have assembled in Dhaka to discuss how the SAARC nations can assist each other in achieving food security regionally, he added. With the forthcoming SAARC summit in view, Rahman said, he was hopeful that this symposium would play effective role in initiating measures in ensuring SAARC regional food security. The central bank chief indicated that the symposium will also discuss ways of increasing food production through adopting appropriate monetary policies. Central bank governors and their deputies of SAARC countries have joined the symposium. It was also addressed by the food minister Abdur Razzaque, deputy governor Nazrul Huda and BRAC executive director Mahabub Hossain. The SAARC summit scheduled for 2009 will be held in 2010 in Bhutan. bd
