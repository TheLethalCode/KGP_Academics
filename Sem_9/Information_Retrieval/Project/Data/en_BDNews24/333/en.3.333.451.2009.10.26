 Dhaka, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority signed a Tk 170 crore deal Monday for three dredgers, the first to be procured in over two decades, to tackle the declining navigability of waterways in the country. A deal was made with 'Vosta LMG-Karnaphuli Joint Venture Consortium', a dredger producing initiative with Karnaphuli Ship Builders Ltd as the local partner of M/S Vosta LMG International jointly of Germany and the Netherlands. The contract was signed in the conference room of the shipping ministry by managing director of the consortium in Bangladesh, MA Rashid, and Noor Jamat Bishash, director of the procurement project. Shipping minister Shahjahan Khan, water transport secretary Abdul Mannan Howlader, BIWTA chairman Abdul Malek Mia and ambassadors of Netherland and Germany were present during the signing. BIWTA chairman said each new dredger will cost Tk 34.32 crores. "Other than this initiative has been taken to buy another 17 dredgers at the cost of Tk 1,450 crores." Part financing by development partners is already underway, said Malek Mia. "The last procurements of dredgers were a single dredger in 1972 and another five in 1975. After that none of the successive governments took any initiative to buy new dredgers," he said. The shipping minister welcomed the move. bdne
