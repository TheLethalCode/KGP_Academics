 Dhaka, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com)Police on Saturday arrested Khandaker Mehnaj Rashid, daughter of fugitive Aug 15 convict Lt Col (retd) Abdur Rashid, in connection with last Wednesday's bomb attack on a ruling party MP. The Detective Branch's Akbar Hossain, investigation officer in the bomb attack case, told bdnews24.com that they had detained Mehnaj from her Gulshan home. The car of Awami League MP Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh was hit by a bomb blast as he was leaving his Motijheel office by car on Wednesday hight. He was unhurt but 13 others, mostly bystanders, were injured in the explosion. Police arrested Kamrul Haque Swapan, the brother of another fugitive convict in the Aug 15, 1975 assassination case Shariful Haque Dalim, the day after the attack. Dalim, who confessed to killing Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Aug 15, 1975, has been convicted and given the death penalty among others in the trial. He is now a fugitive, while the long-stalled appeals of other of the death convicts in the case are being heard in the Supreme Court. Police have also arrested Abdur Rahim, a worker of the Freedom Party, which was founded, among others, by another death row convict in the Mujib assassination trial Syed Faruq Rahman. Taposh, a barrister by profession and a nephew of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, is involved with the legal team assisting the state counsels in the appeals proceedings of the Mujib assassination case. The young MP, whose parents Sheikh Fazlul Haque Moni and Arzoo Moni were killed on Aug 15, 1975 alongside Mujib, alleged on Thursday that the attack was made upon him to derail the appeals process in the Supreme Court. He filed a case with Motijheel Police Station on the day, mentioning no names, but alleging that the relatives and associates of those convicted of the Aug 15 killings were involved in the attack. The case details said they carried out the attack in a premeditated manner to kill him in order to disrupt the final outcome of the trial of the killers of 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujib. Police on Friday took Swapan and Rahim into remand for eight days. In the remand hearing, police said the attack on Taposh was planned by family of the "the self-confessed killers of Bangabandhu". They said they needed 10 more days to grill the accused to track down their associates. Lawyer Masud Ahmed Talukder contested the remand plea by police and sought bail for the accused Swapan. "Swapan is accused only because he is the brother of major Dalim  Swapan was arrested 24 hours into the incident, which was planned and a conspiracy against him." "His name is not there in the case charges," said Talukder. "Swapan is a neighbour of barrister Taposh. They have had a warm relation all through and nothing notable has ever happened between them." The lawyer said Swapan was also a freedom fighter who was awarded the 'Bir Uttam' medal. "He is 60 years old and has recently had a kidney operation," he added. Swapan's wife, Salma Haque Rozi, broke into tears in court after police secured the remand. bdnews
