<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 26 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court began hearing arguments from a third defence counsel on the Bangabandhu murder appeals on Monday. Abdur Rezzak Khan, counsel for death convict Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, started delivering his arguments after advocate Khan Saifur Rahman concluded his arguments on behalf of death convict Syed Faruk Rahman. The five-judge Appellate Division bench headed by Justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam began the hearing for the 16th day at 9:45am. At the fifteenth day's hearing on Sunday Rahman said Faruk "deserves" to have his death penalty commuted to a life sentence. Faruk has been on the death row for 14 long years and his death sentence "deserved" to be reduced to a life sentence, he said. Rahman also said it has not been proved that Faruk was present at the scene at the time of assassination of Mujib and his family. The freshly formed bench headed by Justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam began hearing the appeals on Mujib murder case on Oct 5. A day before, chief justice M M Ruhul Amin constituted the bench with justices Mohammed Abdul Aziz, Bijoy Kumar Das, Mohammed Mozammel Hossain and Surendra Kumar Sinha being the other members.
