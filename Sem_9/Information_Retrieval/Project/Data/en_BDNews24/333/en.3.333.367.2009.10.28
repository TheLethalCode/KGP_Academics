<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former tennis champion Andre Agassi has admitted in an autobiograpy that he used crystal meth in 1997 when his career was floundering. People magazine said in a story on its website on Tuesday that Agassi admits to drug use in his memoir, "Open: An Autobiography," as well as talking about his hair loss and doomed 1997-1999 marriage to actress Brooke Shields. "I can't speak to addiction, but a lot of people would say that if you're using anything as an escape, you have a problem," he told People magazine. People magazine and Sports Illustrated will run excerpts this week from Agassi's book ahead of its November 9 publication. The American tennis player became a fan favourite after winning Wimbledon in 1992 when he was a cocky rebel with shoulder-length hair and went on to win the US Open in 1994. But his on-court career hit a low point in 1997 when Agassi struggled with a wrist injury and he ended the year at No. 122 in the world rankings. Publisher Knopf said Agassi reveals in his memoir that he suffered a shattering loss of confidence. Agassi, 39, said he was not worried about the impact of his admissions on his fans. "I was worried for a moment, but not for long ... I wore my heart on my sleeve and my emotions were always written on my face. I was actually excited about telling the world the whole story," he said. His memoir also talks about the love he eventually found with his current wife, retired tennis professional Steffi Graf.
