 Dhaka, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com)The fire at the National Curriculum and Textbook Board' warehouse was an act of sabotage, it was not started by an electrical short-circuit, the education minister says, quoting probe finds. Nurul Islam Nahid, briefing the media on the findings of the probe body on Thursday afternoon, said the investigation primarily confirmed that the fire incident was an act of sabotage. "Some powder was found in different places of the warehouse. It can be an evidence of sabotage," said Nahid, who had expressed such fear on Wednesday. On top of that, he added, the firefighters while spraying water found some white powder flowing with the water. Some powder was retrieved near the ventilator which was supposedly thrown from outside, he said. All the evidences have been preserved, said Nahid The fire at the warehouse in Tejgaon in Dhaka that had smouldered on into the fifth day was finally fully extinguished in the early hours of Thursday. He said the simultaneous occurrence of fire at three spots in the warehouse and the statement of the guard who happened to see the fire first clearly indicated that it was sabotaged. The minister brushed away a query as to whether the probe body was pressed to submit a report in line with his statement. "I have never made any statement which would influence the task of the probe committee," he said. Rather, some newspapers suspected it was as an act of sabotage, he said. A seven-member team, headed by Razia Begum, additional secretary of education ministry, was tasked on Sunday to identify the cause of the fire, an estimate of the losses incurred and those responsible. The minister said the committee would hand the final report in next 15 days, following which the next steps would be decided. He said the government's distribution of textbooks for primary, secondary and madrasa students would be completed in time despite almost 1,000 tonnes of books and paper being destroyed. A 'National Monitoring Committee' headed by the minister was formed to ensure distribution of textbooks among the students in time. The other members include primary and mass education minister Afsarul Amin, secretaries of the relevant ministries, director general of secondary and higher secondary education directorate, NCTB chairman. A technical committee has also been constituted to assess the extent of losses and set future course of action. bd
