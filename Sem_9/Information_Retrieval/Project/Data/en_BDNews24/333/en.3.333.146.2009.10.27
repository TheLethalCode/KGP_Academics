<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court ended arguments hearing on the Bangabandhu murder appeals for Tuesday. The five-judge Appellate Division bench headed by Justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam began the 17th day's hearing at 9:50am with third defence counsel Abdur Rezzak Khan presenting his arguments on behalf of death convict Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan. The hearing ended at 1:30pm. The apex court on Monday heard from Rezzak that his client was not involved with the assassination of president 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Shahriar Rashid had gone to Dhaka radio station on Aug 15, 1975, to discharge duty but he was not linked to the killing events at Bangabandhu's house. Two lawyers had so far concluded their arguments for their respective clients. Barrister Abdullah Al Mamun contended for retired Major Bazlul Hua and retired Lt Col A K M Mohiuddin (lancer). Advocate Khan Saifur Rahman argued for dismissed Lt Col Syed Faruk Rahman and retired Lt Col Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery). The freshly formed bench headed by Justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam began hearing the appeals on Mujib murder case on Oct 5. A day before, chief justice M M Ruhul Amin constituted the bench with justices Mohammed Abdul Aziz, Bijoy Kumar Das, Mohammed Mozammel Hossain and Surendra Kumar Sinha being the other members. bdne
