 Faridpur, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com)Divers recovered two more bodies from the Padma River on Saturday morning taking the death toll to eight a day after a trawler sank at Shaitankhali in Faridpur, police said. Thirteen trawler men were still missing, said rescue workers. Sadarpur police chief Naresh Karmaker said the two bodies, identified as 20-year-old Altaf Hossain and 24-year-old Kalu Hossain, were recovered after rescue work had resumed at around 10:30am Saturday. The earth-laden trawler, hit by another vessel, capsized early on Friday. Six bodies were recovered until 9:30pm that night, all of them day labourers from Patiata village in Pabna's Chatmohor. They were identified as Dudu Miah, 45, 'Doulat', 22, 'Liton', 22, 'Siraj', 25, and 'Wasim', 23, along with an unidentified man in his late 20s. Abdul Alim, a survivor, said that the trawler carrying 42 labourers anchored at Shaitankhali on Thursday evening. "The trawler was supposed to leave for Fatullah on Friday. But heavy fog forced it to wait." He said those sleeping on the deck and roof of the trawler were able to swim to safety, but 21 had initially gone missing. Deputy commissioner Helaluddin told bdnews24.com they would continue with their operations to recover the 13 still missing. Helaluddin said a five-member diving team had been conducting rescue work from 5:30pm on Friday night. He also said strong currents had been hampering the recovery work. bdn
