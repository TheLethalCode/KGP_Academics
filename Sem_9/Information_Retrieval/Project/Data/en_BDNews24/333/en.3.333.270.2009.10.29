 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)--The Supreme Court could not conclude arguments hearing in the Bangabandhu assassination case on Thursday as the last defence counsel failed to finish its presentation even after he was asked. Abdullah Al Mamun, counsel for last death convict appellant retired Lt Col A K M Mohiuddin (lancer), said he would need more time to be done with his arguments. He has been given one more hour to wrap up his statements at the next hearing scheduled for Sunday. The five-member Appellate Division bench headed by Justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam began the 19th day's hearing at around 9:45am and ended it at 1:30pm. He had earlier argued for another death convict appellant, retired major Bazlul Huda. Next, Khan Saifur Rahman argued for two appellants--dismissed Lt Col Syed Faruq Rahman and Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery). Abdur Rezzak Khan, counsel for death convict retired Lt Col Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, concluded his arguments on Wednesday. The court told Mamun Wednesday to make his presentation based on facts and testimony. As per rules, it is the prosecution's turn to present its statements after the defence is through with the same. The freshly formed bench began hearing on Oct 5 the appeals against previous court sentences to hang them in the case regarding the assassination of the nation's founding leader 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Its progress has depended upon the political dispensation in power. None was allowed to file a case immediately after the assassination of the independence architect Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Aug 15, 1975. The government of Khandker Mustaque Ahmed that was installed after the bloody military coup passed an ordinance in November that year indemnifying the perpetrators and closing the door on the possibility of a trial. The Awami League government revoked the indemnity ordinance in 1996 and cleared the way for the trial. Then, Sheikh Mujib's personal assistant Muhitul Islam filed a case on Oct 2, 1996 with Dhanmondi Police Station against 24 persons. On Nov 8, 1998, Dhaka sessions judge Golam Rasul awarded death sentences to 15 of the 20 accused. Four of the convictsMajor (retd) Bazlul Huda, Lt Col (dismissed) Syed Faruk Rahman, Lt Col (retd) Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Lt Col (retd) Mohiuddin Ahmedappealed to the High Court against the verdict. On Dec 14, 2000, the High Court gave a split verdict in the caseJustice Md Ruhul Amin upheld death sentences of 10 of the convicts but Justice A B M Khairul Haque retained death sentences of all the 15. On April 30, 2001 Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim of a third High Court bench upheld death sentences of 12 and acquitted three. Of the 12 death convicts, four appealed against their sentence in the Appellate Division in the same year. Another death convict, retired Lt Col (lancer) A K M Mohiuddin, made an appeal from jail after he was deported from the United States on June 18 last year. Of those having received death sentence, former Lt Col Abdur Rashid, Lt Col Shariful Haq Dalim, Lt Col Noor, Risalder Moslemuddin, Lt Col Rashed Chowdhury and Capt Majed are absconding. The detained death convicts are dismissed Lt Col Syed Faruk Rahman, retired Lt Col Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, retired Lt Col Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery), retired Major Bazlul Huda and retired Lt Col A K M Mohiuddin (lancer). Absconding convict Aziz Pasha died in exile in Zimbabwe. bdne
