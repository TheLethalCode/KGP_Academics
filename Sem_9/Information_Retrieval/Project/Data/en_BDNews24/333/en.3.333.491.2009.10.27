 NEW DELHI, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia's injury woes deepened on Tuesday when bowlers Brett Lee and Mitchell Johnson were ruled out on the eve of the second one-dayer against India. Lee (right elbow) and Johnson (ankle) joined James Hopes on the sidelines after the all rounder limped off the field with a hamstring injury during Sunday's four-run win in Vadodara that put Australia ahead in the seven-match series. Selectors have called up New South Wales all rounder Moises Henriques and he is expected to join the squad before Saturday's third match in New Delhi, a team statement said. "Our medical staff have now decided that while both Brett Lee and Mitchell Johnson's injuries have responded well to treatment, they will be severe enough to rule them out of contention for tomorrow's match in Nagpur," chief selector Andrew Hilditch said. "With James Hopes' right hamstring injury being more serious and likely keep him out for at least the next two matches it is thought adding a standby player to the squad is a necessity." Lee, who had been battling injury concerns, regained his form to help Australia retain the ICC Champions Trophy in South Africa earlier this month. Left-arm Johnson twisted his left ankle while fielding in Vadodara, although he bowled his full quota of overs. Henriques will remain with the squad until at least the fourth match in Mohali.
