<TITLE> SPECIAL: Solar power sector in need of support </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com)Policy support is needed to see solar power, the most abundant source of alternative energy, take off as a popular power option in Bangladesh, say proponents. Since the mid-'90s, a number of companies, in particular Grameen Shakti, have tried to make the technology popular, but it is yet to gain a strong foothold countrywide almost 13 years after its introduction in Bangladesh. . "Most people back in those days could not believe a solar system can cater to electricity needs of a whole household, but today it's more or less achievable," said Dipal Chandra Barua, managing director of Grameen Shakti. Shakti, a concern of Grameen Bank, is a pioneer in promoting solar power in Bangladesh, having started its operations in 1996. The initial problem in installing solar power systems was the price, which ordinary people could not afford. Shakti took up the initiative to market solar power among people in remote rural areas, lending them funds on easy terms so they can install the system. Experts now believe that urban real-estate developers can also find solar panels as a good alternative for emergency power back up for the new buildings. "In view of frequent load shedding and power outages, I would prefer solar system as a convenient alternative. Because the price of solar panels is roughly equal to that of generators and IPSs," says Harun Ur Rashid, who owns a construction firm. To date, some 230,000 units of solar system have been sold in rural Bangladesh, especially in remote villages which have no access to national electricity grids, according to Grameen Shakti figures. "At first, people were just curious about the technologyBut slowly they became interested to own such a convenient energy system," says Barua. "Between 1996 and 2003, we installed just 10,000 systems...it's not much but it gave us the confidence that it has a potential." But the thrust came in 2003 when the state-owned entity, Infrastructure Development Company of Bangladesh (IDCOL) offered to finance the solar power sector. IDCOL's support really helped as now Grameen Shakti sells 10,000 units a month, according to Barua. "But it's still a long way to go Given proper support, the sector can grow in a far bigger way," he added. The problem lies in the rules and procedure of financing. IDCOL finances solar power projects only in off-grid areas. "It seems good from a development point of view, but practically, it doesn't make any sense or there's no reason to leave out the urban areas," observed Barua. An expensive product like this needs to create a market and with the recent power-shortages leading to increased sales of IPSs and generators, there's no doubt that solar energy systems can also help mitigate the sufferings of power-starved urban population. Moreover, solar power is green energy and it would cut greenhouse gas emissions as fossil fuels are not used. It's also cost-effective because there's no need to replace batteries, Rashid pointed out. Solar energy systems are still relatively high priced. A 50-watt solar system that can fire four lamps and run a black-and-white TV costs Tk 27,000, which is very high for poor rural households. However, Grameen Shakti's deal for the villagers gives a 36-month installment payment facility, which is pretty much the reason behind the rising sales figure. Though the price is out of reach of the villagers, it's expected that millions in urban areas can afford it, many of them having the capacity to buy the solar panels paying cash. IDCOL currently works with 15 other organisations like Grameen Shakti to promote solar power system. But they must expand their funding scheme to the cities and townships to make it popular. The industry badly needs to be made competitive and be able to sell to everyone who can afford it, says Barua. When profits start rolling in more people will be interested to enter the business and the increased competition, in an ideal scenario, should push the price lower. The price of the solar panels is high because they have to be imported from abroad. "Every component of the system is locally manufactured, but the solar panels we use, are imported from Japan," explained Barua. He believes that removal of import tax, advance income tax and VAT on solar panels would really help the sector to grow fast. bd
