 Abdur Rahim Harmachhi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com)Inflation rate has once again begun soaring, which, the economists fear, may go higher in the near future. Inflation rate has increased to 4.69 percent in August on a point-to-point basis, which was 2.25 in June and 3.46 in July. The rate of inflation in June, 2008 was 10.6 percent, the July figure was 10.82 and 10.11 in August. A review of the BBS data reveal that the escalating prices of fuel, food and other essentials in the international market led to Bangladesh's rate of inflation soaring to 11.59 percent in Dec 2007, which gradually eased down to 6.03 in Dec 2008. In March, 2009, the rate was 5.04 percent, which further dipped to 2.25 in June. BBS data indicate that inflation in the food sector in August was 4.93 percent and for other sectors, it was 4.54. August inflation figure for the urban areas was 5.41 percent whereas for rural areas it was 4.25 percent. For the food sector in rural areas in August, inflation rate was 4.07 percent, which for the urban area was 6.92. The above for other sectors was 4.60 percent in rural areas and 4.39 percent for urban areas. To express using technical terminology, the point-to-point inflation determined indicates how much prices of essentials have soared between a particular period (month) of the last year and the identical period of the current year. Akbar Ali Khan, former finance secretary and adviser to a caretaker government, said commodity prices had come down to a tolerable level after the Awami League formed government in Jan 2009, which lowered the inflation rate too. "The recent global scarcity of commodities, neighbouring India's decision to suspend exports of certain commodities due to acute production shortfalls, delayed rains etc might very well push the inflation rate up, which poses a serious challenge to the incumbent government," he said. Khan has just resigned his office of the Regulatory Reforms Commission chairman. Bangladesh Institute for Development Studies research director Jahed Bakht said, "The 4.69 percent inflation indicator isn't an intimidating figure. But we have to watch and act closely and fast so that it doesn't escalate to double digits." The World Bank Dhaka office senior economist Jahid Hossain said on Thursday in a view exchange meet with reporters on the state of the Bangladesh economy, "The escalating prices in the international market and the Tk 39,000 crore liquidity in the banking sector (portions of which are likely to be injected into the national investment stream) pose a threat with regard to the stability of the inflation state." bd
