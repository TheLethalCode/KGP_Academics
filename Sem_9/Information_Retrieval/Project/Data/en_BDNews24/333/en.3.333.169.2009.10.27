 Dhaka, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com)--The law-enforcing agencies have been put on the highest alert for preventing any breach of law and order during the ongoing hearing of Bangabandhu assassination case, the state minister for home said on Tuesday. The 'evil forces' are now trying to stop the final leg of the trial for the assassination of president 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman , Shamsul Haque Tuku told reporters after a programme at the Department of Narcotics Control. All jails in the country have been on red alert since midnight of Oct 21. On why red alert was sounded, home minister Sahara Khatun, who also attended the programme, said: "This is a routine work. The order needs to be issued sometimes." On whether there was any apprehension during the murder trial, Tuku said: "We have to apply highest cautionary measures to avoid disruption of law and order during the trial." Both the home minister and her deputy evaded the direct reply to the fear of disruption/sabotage. Replying to a query, Tuku said the law enforcers were asked to take action about the death threats given to attorney general Mahbubey Alam and Indian high commissioner Pinak Ranjan Chakrabarty. Sahara had told bdnews24.com, "The government was already aware of security issues from the start of the appeals proceedings on Oct 5." She had earlier said the RAB and police had been given directions to be "more alert". Security had been tightened at all key points and installations, including jails, in the capital and around the country, she said. Ruling MP Fazle Noor Taposh, also a member of a panel of lawyers assisting the state counsels in the appeals proceedings, came under a bomb attack as he was leaving his Motijheel office by car on Oct 21. Six people have been arrested so far following the case filed by Taposh. Four of them four are relatives of the convicts of Bangabandhu assassination case. bd
