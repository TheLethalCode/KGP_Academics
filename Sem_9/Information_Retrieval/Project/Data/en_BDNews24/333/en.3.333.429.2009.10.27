 Abdur Rahim Harmachi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com)Regional central bank chiefs have shown interest in replicating Bangladesh Bank's refinance scheme for share-croppers, BB governor Atiur Rahman said on Tuesday. A SAARC delegation, comprising governors and deputy-governors of the region's central banks, accompanied Rahman at the scheme's inauguration at Hosenpur village, in Chandpur district. "They were very appreciative of the programme," Rahman told bdnews24.com. "They had no such initiative for sharecroppers exists anywhere in the world." He said the delegation had also remarked that the scheme could play an effective role in ensuring food security in the current global situation. Bangladesh Bank established a Tk 500 crore fund for collateral free loans to some 500,000 sharecroppers in 160 upazilas of the country, the first of its kind in Bangladesh, to be distributed through BRAC, the country's largest NGO. Under the initiative, BRAC will borrow from the fund at 5 percent interest and distribute the collateral free loans to sharecroppers at 10 percent interest. Of the Tk 500 crore fund, Tk 450 crore would be given in crop loans and Tk 50 crore in agriculture equipment loans. Addressing the ceremony at Chandpur, Rahman said, "It's our duty to assist the farmers who fought to liberate the country." He said share-croppers were receiving loans for the first time. "We can see a massive response among them." He said they would get further loans if they repay in time. Seeds were also distributed among the farmers at the programme. The SAARC delegation was in Dhaka to join the Bangladesh Bank-hosted two-day symposium on 'Food Security: Role of SAARC's Central Banks'. Abdul Qadeer Fitrat, governor of Afghanistan Bank, told bdnews24.com, "We're really surprised to see this programme. It's amazing that a landless farmer can cultivate crops by taking loans without a mortgage deal." "We'll consider if the programme can be launched in our country." "Poverty is the major problem for both the countries and we're fighting against it. This special loan will contribute significantly to eradicate poverty by increasing food production," he added. Mahbub Hossain, executive director of BRAC, said it has formed groups comprising 30 to 40 sharecroppers. The loans, up to a maximum of Tk 25,000 each, would be given to them as members of the groups. According to the deal, farmers having land less than 2.5 acres with no SSC qualifications will come under the scheme. BRAC will realise loan repayment instalments based on harvest seasons. Rahman has previously said the central bank will monitor the scheme to see that real sharecroppers are getting loans. Bangladesh Bank may take up similar projects with other NGOs if the scheme proves successful. bdne
