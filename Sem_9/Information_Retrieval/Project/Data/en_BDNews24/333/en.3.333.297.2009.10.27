 Dhaka, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com)  Zimbabwe cruised to a comfortable five-wicket victory in the day-night first one-day international against Bangladesh at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur on Tuesday. Despite two hold ups due to fans throwing down bottles and other objects onto the field, Zimbabwe eventually reached 189-5 in 34.4 overs. Elton Chigumbura top-scored with an unbeaten 60 while Stuart Matsikenyeri remained 47 not out. Before that partnership, however, Bangladesh were in the hunt when Dolar Mahmud removed the dangerous Charles Coventry for 32. But man of the match Chigumbura and Stuart Matsikenyeri steered the side home with a match-winning sixth wicket stand that produced 99 runs. Chigumbura brought up the winning runs with four through cover off Abdur Razzak to ensure the visitors took a 1-0 lead in the five-match series. The next match is at the same venue on Thursday. Speaking in the post-match ceremony, Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan said: "I thought we didn't bat properly and we didn't execute our plans well. We lost too many wickets early and that lost us the game. Dollar and Rahim played well. There are four more games and I am sure we can come back." Hamilton Masakadza (on behalf of injured Prosper Utseya): "It's a great start to the series. Chasing was always better. That partnership between took us home and Chigumbura bowled well also." Chigumbura commented: "I set the tone with the bowling and finished off the game with the bat. You needed to bowl in the right areas, that's when you create chances. I just knew that we had to get a big partnership and it came on." The tourists survived an early scare when Razzak and Rubel Hossain brought Bangladesh back into the low-scoring contest. Left-arm spinner Razzak ripped out three wickets, two off successive deliveries in the eighth over and four overs later Bangladesh's quickest bowler Rubel Hossain had Hamilton Masakadza caught superbly at backward point to leave the tourists on 62 for four in 13 overs. Razzak began a devastating eighth over by trapping Chamu Chibhabha (26) and Brendan Taylor ( 0 ) for lbws off successive deliveries with the score on 39. He completed a fantastic over bowling Tatenda Taibu on the same score. Earlier, Bangladesh were all out for 186 in 46.5 overs after being put into bat. Mushfiqur Rahim propped up the innings with a workmanlike 56 off 78 balls. He added 54 runs for the ninth wicket with Dolar Mahmud who smashed an entertaining 30-ball 41 which included three sixes and four fours. Mushfiq was also involved in a vital seventh wicket stand of 53 with Naeem Islam (21) which pulled the Tigers out of danger after the hosts slumped to 62-6. Zimbabwe made the perfect start after winning the toss when Elton Chigumbura sent back both openers Junaed Siddique and Tamim Iqbal cheaply. He also removed Mohammad Ashraful (20) who was caught behind by Tatenda Taibu. However, the real damage was done by medium-pacer Chamu Chibhabha's double strike in the 19th over, which saw him remove skipper Shakib Al Hasan and Mahmudullah Riyad for 13 and four respectively after Raqibul Hasan was run out for 16 in the previous over, left the Tigers in utter disarray. The other Zimbabwean wicket-takers were Kyle Jarvis with 2-28 while spinners Ray Price and Graeme Cremer had one
