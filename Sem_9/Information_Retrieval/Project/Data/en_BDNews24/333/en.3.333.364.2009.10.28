 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka magistrate on Wednesday granted police five days to question Lutfozzaman Babar in connection with the Aug 21 2004 grenade attack on an Awami League rally during his tenure as state minister for home. Babar's lawyer, Gazi Quamrul Islam filed a petition to the High Court seeking an order for his client to be questioned at the jail gate. "Babar is now very sick. If he is taken into remand his life might be at risk," Islam said. Police had sought 10 days to grill Babar in the remand hearing earlier in the day. The first additional chief metropolitan magistrate for Dhaka, Ehsanul Haque, granted five. The former state minister for home was produced in the court at around 12:30pm, seated on a chair in the dock. Babar, already behind bars since March this year, was shown arrested in the grenade attack case on Monday. Babar began serving 17 years on March 5 this year in an arms case. The 2004 grenade attack on an Awami League rally at Bangabandhu Avenue killed at least 23 people and left scores injured, including prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who was then opposition leader. Some 22 people stand charged in the cases, including former BNP state minister Abdus Salam Pintu, his brother Maolana Tajuddin, also the alleged grenade supplier, and Mufti Hannan, leader of banned Islamist outfit Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami. Of them, 13 accused including Pintu and Hannan are now behind bars while the remaining accused are on the run. The Criminal Investigation Department pressed charges in two cases, a murder case and an explosives case, on June 11 last year. Some 61 among 412 witnesses have so far testified. The witnesses include president Zillur Rahman, prime minister Sheikh Hasina, home minister Sahara Khatun and AL's former general secretary Abdul Jalil. b
