 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has urged the people to be more aware of the difficulties wrought by climate change, as she addressed parliament Wednesday on her return from a development conference in Stockholm earlier this week. "I've called on the international community to raise a viable global fund so that we and other vulnerable countries can fight losses that climate change will bring," she said in a question-answer session as the House reconvened after a two-week break. "Bangladesh is the one to face losses, but it is the industrially developed countries, not we, that are responsible," she said. Quoting scientists that a large part of the country's south will go under water if the sea level rises by a metre, Hasina spelled out a number of measures that her government has undertaken including major river dredging and raising river banks. bdnews24.com/sum/kr
