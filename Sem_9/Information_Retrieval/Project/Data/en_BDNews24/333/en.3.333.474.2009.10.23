 ZURICH, Oct 23, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States has formally asked Switzerland to extradite film director Roman Polanski, who fled sentencing in California on child sex charges in 1977, the Swiss justice ministry said Friday. It said it would make a decision on extradition based on a hearing and on information provided by Polanski's lawyer, but that there was no deadline. "We will take the time that is needed," spokesman Folco Galli said. Polanski will be able to appeal against any extradition decision to the Swiss Federal Criminal Court and, in the last instance, the Federal Supreme Court, the ministry said. The 76-year-old Oscar-winning director, who holds dual French and Polish citizenship, was arrested to comply with a U.S. warrant when he flew into Switzerland on September 26 to receive a lifetime achievement award at a film festival. Polanski fled the United States 32 years ago, when he was due to be sentenced for having unlawful sex with a girl aged 13. U.S. judicial sources have said the extradition process is complex and could take years if Polanski challenges it. A Swiss court this week rejected a bid by Polanski for release on bail, saying the risk that he would flee was too high. His lawyer Herve Temime declined to comment. TURBULENT LIFE Polanski pleaded guilty to having sex with the girl in 1977, and spent 42 days in prison undergoing psychiatric tests. But he fled the United States before the case was concluded because he believed a judge would sentence him to up to 50 years behind bars despite a plea agreement for time already served. Polanski has avoided countries such as Britain that have extradition treaties with the United States. He has never returned to Los Angeles, where his pregnant wife, actress Sharon Tate, was murdered by followers of Charles Manson in 1969. Polanski was born in Paris to Polish-Jewish parents in 1933. His mother died in the Nazi concentration camp at Auschwitz. His first full-length feature, "Knife in the Water," won a number of awards, and his reputation grew with "Repulsion," his study of a woman terrified by sex who becomes a murderer. Polanski, who is married to the French actress Emmanuelle Seigner and has two children with her, scored huge hits in the United States with 1968 horror thriller "Rosemary's Baby" and 1974's corruption thriller "Chinatown." He won his first and only Best Director Oscar in 2002 for "The Pianist," the story of a Polish-Jewish musician who sees his world collapse with the outbreak of World War
