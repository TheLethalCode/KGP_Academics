<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com)Those who do not want to see the war criminals and the Bangabandhu killers punished are busy destabilising the country by creating chaos and confusion all around, the law minister has said. "The bomb attack on MP Fazle Noor Taposh MP is also linked to the chain of those disturbing events. It's part of the ongoing conspiracy of the invisible clique dedicated to providing protection to the killers of Bangabandhu," Shafique Ahmed said at a meeting at Dhaka Reporters' Unity Friday. Taposh escaped the Wednesday night's bomb attack on his car in downtown Motijheel unhurt but at least 13 bystanders were injured in the blast. Declaring that no evil power will be able to subvert the trial, the minister said, "The trial of the killers of Bangabandhu will be carried out on the soils of this country. The war criminals will also be tried. Let there be no doubt about that." Taposh's parents, Sheikh Fazlul Haque Moni and Arzu Moni, were also killed in the military coup on Aug 15, 1975. Sheikh Moni was the nephew of independence hero 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. State minister for local government, rural development and cooperatives Jahangir Kabir Nanak was present at the triennial general meeting of the DRU cooprerative society. DRU president Shamim Ahmed, general secretary Pothik Saha, Bangladesh Federal Union of Journalists general secretary Altaf Mahmud and others also spoke. Nanak said, "Journalists work under various pressures amid great risks. Dhaka Reporters Unity should have a dedicated committee to probe the incidents of oppression on reporters." He assured DRU of a plot of land for setting up a permanent office ad said the relevant file will be looked up. Shamim Ahmed said, "People generally consider journalists have no problem and none of them ever think about helping us. We all are in islands, since most of us do not have a house even." Altaf Mahmud said, "Recently, journalists have been persecuted with support and assistance from the ruling party leaders including MPs. It had happened in the past too." "We expected the situation would change. We are sad to note that it has not." "Genuine journalists do not get residential plots. Non-journalists manage large plots by deploying various ploys and through corrupt bureaucrats," said Pothik Saha. b
