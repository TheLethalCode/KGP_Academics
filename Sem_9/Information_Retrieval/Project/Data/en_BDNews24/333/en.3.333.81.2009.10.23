<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com) Kamrul Haque Swapan, the brother of Shariful Haque Dalim, was arrested Thursday night in connection with Wednesday's bomb attack on Awami League MP Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh. Dalim, who confessed to killing Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Aug 15, 1975, was convicted and given the death penalty. He is now a fugitive, while the long-stalled appeals of other of the death convicts in the case are being heard in the Supreme Court. Taposh, a nephew of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, is also involved with the legal team assisting the state counsels in the appeals proceedings. The young MP, whose parents Sheikh Fazlul Haque Moni and Arzoo Moni were also murdered on Aug 15, came under a bomb attack as he was leaving his Motijheel office by car on Wednesday night. He was unhurt but 13 others, mostly bystanders, were injured by the blast. Taposh alleged on Thursday that the attack was made upon him to derail the appeals process in the Supreme Court. He filed a case with Motijheel Police Station earlier in the day, mentioning no names, but alleging that the relatives and associates of those convicted of the Aug 15 killings were involved in the attack. The case details said they carried out the attack in a premeditated manner to kill him in order to disrupt the final outcome of the trial of the killers of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib. Home minister Sahara Khatun and Awami League leaders all echoed the same sentiment on Thursday, prior to the arrest of Dalim's brother. "The bomb attack on Fazle Noor Taposh during the appeals in the Bangabandhu murder case is not a discrete event," Sahara told reporters when she went to Dhaka Medical College Hospital to see those injured in the blast. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam had also said before Swapan's arrest, "The attack on Taposh proves that those who do not want the trial of the murder of Bangabandhu to be upheld are active." "Those conspirators want to subvert the trial," he said, adding that this attack may have been carried out to intimidate the public prosecutors. "Those of us who are public prosecutors are not scared. We are going to fight in court resolutely," Alam said. He also demanded heightened security at the Supreme Court premises. In fact along with Dalim's arrest, Thursday also saw security tightened countrywide. The government ordered law enforcers to be on extra alert due to the appeals proceedings and the bomb attack on Taposh, home minister Sahara Khatun told bdnews24.com that night. "The government was already conscious of security issues from the start of the case proceedings." "But law enforcing agencies, including RAB and police, have been given directions to be more alert." "Security has been tightened at all key points and installations in the capital and around the country," she said. Home secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikder also told bdnews24.com security at the prisons where the convicts in the Bangabandhu murder case are being held had been tightened. bdnew
