 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com)--The chance of the main opposition joining parliament are dwindling because of the ruling party's 'autocratic attitude', BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said on Wednesday. "BNP would not attend the third session resumeing today (Wednesday)," Delwar told a press conference. "Our parliamentarians cannot attend," Delwar said at the party chairperson's Gulshan office. "They (the ruling party) are so disrupting the environment inside and outside parliament through their autocratic attitude with our leaders and MPs that the chances of us joining the parliament are falling." He said, "In view of the hostile attitude of the government towards the opposition it seems that they have no belief in democracy. They are thinking theirs is the one and only, the last government." "Presenting colourful dreams of 'changing days' they are in fact revealing the face of fascism." The third session of the ninth parliament resumed Wednesday afternoon after a break of 14 days. The main opposition party has been abstaining from parliament, except for a few occasions, since the first session in January. Their abstention stemmed from a dispute with the ruling party over front row seating. Later the main opposition party brought allegations against the government of oppression and harassment of BNP leaders and supporters. On the seating dispute, Delwar said "Accepting the fabricated results of made-up polls, BNP attended the parliament on the first day but the autocratic Awami League did not let us remain there." He also said prime minister Sheikh Hasina's comments about the distribution of seats for her opposition coalition in the eighth parliament, under BNP's tenure, were "untrue". "In fact, all ten seats of the front row on the left side of the speaker were allocated to the then opposition. Among those, Awami League had eight and Jatiya Party had two. None of the ruling party MPs was allocated any of those seats," said Delwar, also the chief whip of the eighth parliament. He went on to say, "Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has also spread misinformation on poverty, education, autarky and price hikes at the anti-poverty conference on Oct 17." The information on the percentage of people living under the poverty line under the present and past governments was misleading, he said. "The government has chosen the way of lying and swindling. When a prime minister speaks such lies we feel ashamed." He criticised the government's failure in maintaining law and order, and accused it of repression of opposition leaders and workers, filing cases anew against them and the government's interference in the upper courts. He said the consequence of lying, conspiracy, repression and fascism "are never good". BNP vice president MK Anwar, former education minister Osman Faruq, MP Barkat Ullah Bulu, the BNP chairperson's press secretary Maruf Kamal Khan and others were present in the press conference. b
