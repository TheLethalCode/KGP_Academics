 Dhaka, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court has given the police five days to grill two sons of detained former Lt Col Mohiuddin Ahmed, one of the death convicts of Bangabandhu murder case, who were arrested early on Tuesday. First additional chief metropolitan magistrate Md Ehsanul Haque granted the time after the police sought 10 days to question them in connection with the case regarding the bomb attack on Awami League MP Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh. Dhaka Metropolitan Police's additional deputy commissioner Mohammed Walid Hossain told bdnews24.com Mohammed Nazmul Hassan Sohel, 35, and Mahbubul Hassan, 30, were arrested in the capital's Dakkhinkhan in Uttara. "We have arrested them for questioning in Fazle Noor Taposh MP bomb attack case," Hossain said. Police earlier arrested fugitive death convict Lt Col Abdur Rashid's daughter Khandaker Mehnaz Rashid and another convict Shariful Haque Dalim's brother Quamrul Haque Swapan. Six people have been arrested so far following the case filed by Taposh. Four of them four are relatives of the convicts of Bangabandhu assassination case. The Supreme Court is currently holding the hearing on the Bangabandhu murder appeals. Taposh, a nephew of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, is also a member of a panel of lawyers assisting the state counsels in the appeals proceedings. The young MP, whose parents Sheikh Fazlul Haque Moni and Arzoo Moni were also murdered on Aug 15, came under a bomb attack as he was leaving his Motijheel office by car on Wednesday night. He was unhurt but 13 others, mostly bystanders, were injured by the blast. Taposh alleged on Thursday that the attack was made upon him to derail the appeals process in the Supreme Court. He filed a case with Motijheel Police Station earlier in the day, mentioning no names, but alleging that the relatives and associates of those convicted of the Aug 15 killings were involved in the attack. The case details said they carried out the attack in a premeditated manner to kill him in order to disrupt the final outcome of the trial of the killers of 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujib. The investigation in the case was transferred to Detective Branch of police on Friday night. b
