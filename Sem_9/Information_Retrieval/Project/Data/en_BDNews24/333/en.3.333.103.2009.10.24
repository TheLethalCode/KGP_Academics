 KATHMANDU, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nepal said on Friday it had no money to pay its ministers because parliament had failed to pass a new budget amid protests by the former Maoist rebels who dominate the legislature. Maoists have disrupted parliament since July, preventing it from discussing the impoverished nation's new budget after a dispute over the firing of the army chief.

Katawal has since retired. Separately, ambassadors from UN Security Council member states urged Nepal to start discharging thousands of former Maoist fighters from camps to allow the United Nations mission in Nepal to complete its mandate in January.

A mid-term discussion on the UNMIN mandate is scheduled on Nov 6 in the Security Council.
