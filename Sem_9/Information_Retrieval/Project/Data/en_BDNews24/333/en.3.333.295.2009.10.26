 TEHRAN,Oct 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei opposes holding direct negotiations with the United States, an Iranian newspaper on Monday cited a senior politician as saying. The comments by vice speaker Mohammad Reza Bahonar appeared to be in contradiction of talks on Tehran's disputed nuclear programme that took place in Switzerland earlier this month and that included officials from the two old foes. Relations with the United States are a sensitive issue in the Islamic Republic, whose clerical leaders see Washington as the Great Satan guilty of "global arrogance".

In the Hambastegi report, Bahonar did not mention the Geneva meeting between Iran, the United States, Russia, China, Germany, France and Britain or follow-up talks held in Vienna last week. "The policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran is based on the absence of official negotiations with the United States ... the conditions for such negotiations must emerge, which have not as yet emerged," Bahonar said. The United States and its allies accuse Iran of seeking to develop nuclear bombs. Iran, the world's fifth-largest oil exporter, denies this and says its nuclear programme is aimed at generating electric
