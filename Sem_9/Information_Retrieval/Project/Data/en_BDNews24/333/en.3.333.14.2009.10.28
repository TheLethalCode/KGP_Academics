<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com)  The government is keenly watching whether any organisation is carrying out militant activities and involved in anti-state activities, the state minister for home said on Wednesday. "If any connection is found against any organisations they will be banned," Shamsul Haq Tuku told reporters after a third meeting of the committee for curbing and resisting militancy at the Secretariat. On whether any organisation would be banned after Hizbut Tahrir, Tuku said: "We don't ban any organisation following a certain plan. "If any organisation poses threat to the independence and sovereignty of the country and is found to have links with militancy, it will be banned." Five organisations have been banned so far on charges of links with militancy. The junior minister was asked whether the government was taking any action against several other organisations allegedly having militancy links. "The government and the law-enforcing agencies are keeping an eye on them. Their activities are being watched," he replied. Asked why those who threw bombs in front of the office of ruling Awami League MP Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh could not be arrested yet, Tuku said: "We are not finished with the arrests yet. The law enforcers are continuing with their effort." On Wednesday's meeting, he said they had sent proposal to the education ministry to include anti-militancy messages in the curricula of schools and colleges. Steps were also being taken to prevent the criminals going from abroad making passports, he said. There were also plans to disseminate anti-militancy campaign in religious places, educational institutions and many other significant places. b
