 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has urged people of the country to be more aware to combat the difficulties wrought by climate change, as she addressed parliament Wednesday on her return from a development conference in Stockholm earlier this week. "I've called on the international community to raise a viable global fund so that we and other vulnerable countries can fight losses that climate change will bring," said the prime minister during her Q&A session as parliament resumed its third session following a two-week break. "Bangladesh will face losses, but it is the industrially developed countries, not we, who are responsible," she said. Citing a large part of the country's south will go under water if sea levels rises by a metre, as predicted by some scientists, Hasina spelled out a number of measures that her government has undertaken including major river dredging and raising river banks. Replying to another question, the prime minister said her government had a plan to establish special training institutes for the physically challenged in each district and special schools for mentally challenged and autistic children. She said further plans have been taken up for the disabled including construction of hostels for the visually impaired, work training for the physically challenged, and shelter homes and centres for the autistic under public-private initiative. The social welfare ministry is currently running 64 coordinated blind school projects in each district town, Hasina said. Four training and rehabilitation centres for the physically challenged are also running in Dhaka, Chittagong, Rajshahi and Khulna divisional headquarters, with another four blind schools and deaf schools are running under these divisional training and rehabilitation centres. On top of these, three more separate schools for the deaf and another blind school have been established, Hasina told the parliament. The prime minister urged all to be more sensitive to people with disabilities. bdnews24.com/sum/
