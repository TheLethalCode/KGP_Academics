 CARACAS, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Venezuela said on Tuesday that it had captured Colombian security agents it said planned to destabilize the government, heightening tensions in the ongoing diplomatic row between the Andean nations. Venezuelan Deputy Foreign Minister Francisco Arias Cardenas confirmed that there had been arrests, but did not provide details or say how many Colombians were detained. "Do not underestimate the importance of an event as serious and as grave as the capture of Colombian DAS security agents committing acts of espionage," Cardenas told reporters.

Chavez, a leftist who has become a flagbearer for anti-US sentiment in the region, has sparred with Uribe over his country's US-backed campaign against Marxist rebels. Chavez denies charges he supports the FARC guerrillas. Chavez's government claims the kidnapping and murder of the Colombian football team is part of the prolonged civil conflict within Colombia and has blamed the killings on Colombian ELN rebels, the country's second largest guerrilla group. Uribe has attributed the murders to terrorism and has requested the Venezuelan government help protect the border population.
