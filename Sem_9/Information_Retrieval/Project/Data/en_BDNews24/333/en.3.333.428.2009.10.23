 Dhaka, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com)Police on Friday stopped newly disbanded Islamist outfit Hizb ut-Tahrir Bangladesh from holding a news conference, but detained no-one. The home ministry on Thursday disbanded the political organisation, considering it a threat to public safety. The organisation's chief coordinator Mohiuddin Ahmed, a Dhaka University associate professor at the Institute of Business Administration, organised the news conference at his residential quarters at the IBA hostel on Green Road at 11am. Police took position around the hostel prior to the conference and as soon as the briefing began, they stormed the spot and announced that Hizb ut-Tahrir being a banned entity would not be allowed to conduct any campaigning or other activities. "The home ministry has put a ban on this organisation's activities," Tejgaon zone additional deputy police commissioner Mohammed Moniruzzaman told bdnews24.com. "Any campaigning or similar activity of the organisation will be considered illegal and therefore, under orders from the authorities, we have stopped them from briefing reporters," he added. Home minister Sahara Khatun told bdnews24.com Thursday, "Hizb ut-Tahrir has been banned after we received the final report on its activities from the intelligence department." Home secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikder told bdnews24.com, "We have for long watched the organisation. We learnt that a number of countries including Turkey already banned Hizb ut-Tahrir for being involved in terrorist activities." "We too considered it a threat to public safety and so disbanded its activities." The party that started operations in Bangladesh in 2001 and the organisation has since been carrying out political activities openly, insisting on the need for a Khilafat-based governance system. Four organisations have been banned in Bangladesh since 2001 on charges of links with militancy. They are Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami, Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh, Jagrata Muslim Janata Bangladesh and Shahadat-e Al Hikma. Prof Mohiuddin Ahmed had told bdnews24.com back in 2007 that their workers in the country numbered around 1,000 and supporters, another 10,000. "We do not endorse the traditional elections, because polls only change leaders. The system or ideals remain unchanged. Changing the government through effecting mass upsurge is what we need," he had said. Hizb ut-Tahrir activities have already also been banned in Germany, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kirgyzstan etc. bdnew
