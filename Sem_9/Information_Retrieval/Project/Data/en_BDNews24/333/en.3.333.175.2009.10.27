<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com)  Twelve Bangladesh Rifles guards petitioned a Dhaka court Tuesday to withdraw their confessional statements in the BDR mutiny case, alleging they were made under duress and persecution. Among them were nayaks Wazed Ali and Kamrul Islam, lance nayaks Zakaria Mollah, Shajahan Kabir and Omar Faruq, sepoys Saiful Islam, Abdur Rahman, Faruq Ahmed, Mizanur Rahman, Ziaul Haque and Sohel Rana. The name of the twelfth could not be established. Sub-inspector Ratan Sheikh, general recording officer at the court, told bdnews24.com that with the twelve, the total number of the petitioners with the same allegation stands at 20. Judge Rashid Kabir, of Dhaka chief metropolitan magistrate's court, recorded the petitions of the twelve BDR members as they stood in the dock on Tuesday. Fazlul Karim Milon and Manjur Hasan Talukder Santu, lawyers for nayak Wazed Ali, told the court, "Wazed was beaten to force him to give his statement. In fact, he is innocent of all allegations against him in the case." Police officer Ratan Sheikh, however, alleged the lawyers were advising their clients to petition the the court "for their own professional and commercial interests". Another 16 BDR members were arrested and detained on Tuesday in connection with February's Peelkhana mutiny, bringing the total number of arrests in the case to 2,062. Some 500 have confessed to their involvement in the mutiny. Over 70 people including, including 57 army officers deputed to BDR, were killed in the bloody Feb 25-26 mutiny at the border force's Peelkhana headquarters. Lalbagh police filed a case on Feb 28. Later the case was transferred to New Market Police Station considering the site of the crime. President Zillur Rahman sent a reference to the Supreme Court on Aug 17 seeking directives on the trial process, specifically whether the trial of the BDR mutineers could be held under the Army Act 1952. The court appointed 10 senior lawyers as amici curiae, or advisers, on the reference. The court began hearing their opinions on the reference on Aug 25 and ended on Sept 3. The majority of the amici curiae opined that trial of BDR personnel could not be held under the Army Act. Seven months after the massacre, the government decided in September that the mutinous border guards would be tried under the BDR Act. But those charged with killings and looting will be tried under the penal code by speedy trial tribunal, an inter-ministerial meeting decided. The government has also decided to change BDR's name, uniform and insignia, among other organisational reforms. b
