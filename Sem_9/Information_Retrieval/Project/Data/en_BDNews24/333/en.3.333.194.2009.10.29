 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)French deputy prime minister and minister for ecology, energy, sustainable development Jean-Louis Borloo arrived in Dhaka on Thursday. Borloo met with prime minister Sheikh Hasina shortly after his arrival in the morning. Foreign ministry officials say this is the first visit of a French minister in 10 years. They also say France wants Bangladesh, one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, to play an active role in the Copenhagen talks in December. Borloo was scheduled to have lunch with Dipu Moni at state guest house Padma to discuss bilateral issues as well as the upcoming climate change negotiations in Copenhagen. The European Union and developing economiesChina and Indiaare in dissent on reduction of greenhouse gases to combat global warming and climate change. EU countries such as Britain, France and Germany want Bangladesh's strong support in the Copenhagen summit, aimed at negotiating binding carbon cut targets for a successor to the Kyoto Protocol that will expire in 2012. On the other hand, China, now the largest polluter, and India, another growing high carbon economy, have been refusing to pledge drastic cuts in emissions for growth of their industries. If industrialised and developing countries do not reach a consensus in December, the Copenhagen talks may fail to ensure global cuts in carbon emissions, resulting in a grave impact on the earth due to global warming, according to experts. Scientists say small island nations and low-lying countries such as Bangladesh may loose significant chunks of their landmass owing to sea level rises caused by melting polar caps.
