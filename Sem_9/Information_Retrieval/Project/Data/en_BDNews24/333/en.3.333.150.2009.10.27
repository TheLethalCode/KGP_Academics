<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court has termed former army chief Maj Gen KM Shafiullah "a coward" for his "inaction" during the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and family on Aug 15, 1975. The five-judge Appellate Division bench headed by Justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam ended the 17th day's hearing of the appeals proceedings in the Sheikh Mujib assassination case on Tuesday. Abdur Rezzak Khan, counsel for death convict Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, like defence counsels before him, questioned the roles of army chief Gen Shafiullah and deputy army chief Ziaur Rahman on the night. He argued not only had they done nothing to prevent the killings, but implied that they were responsible. He told the Supreme Court that deputy army chief Ziaur Rahman on hearing the news had replied, "So what?" Presenting witness testimony from the trial, Rezzak said: "Ziaur Rahman was told that the president was dead." "Zia replied, 'So what? The vice president is there. Uphold the constitution.'" But Rezzak's main condemnation was of the army chief, who did not act to prevent the killings. "On the night of killings, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman had called Gen Shafiullah and asked for help," he said. "He told Shafiullah: 'Send your forces. My house is under attack. Sheikh Kamal (Mujib's eldest son) might be killed'. "Shafiullah simply replied, 'I am trying to do something. Can't you leave your home?'" "Shafiullah, only later, tried to reach Mujib by phone again, at 6am, but got no reply," said the counsel. Rezzak said Shafiullah had reportedly ordered others instead, including Ziaur Rahman, Shafayat Jamil, Khaled Mosharraf and Rakkhi Bahini forces, to rescue Sheikh Mujib and his family. "Shafiullah himself went to the 46th Brigade office where army members were celebrating," said the counsel. The court said: "Perhaps the army chief was a coward. He may have been scared to act." But, the court asked Rezzak, how was defendant Shahriar Rashid benefited from that argument. Rezzak replied that the main players and coordinators of the Aug 15 killings remained untouched. He said, "Shahriar Rashid was not even present at the scene and a person cannot be charged if they are not present at a scene unless a common intention in a shared plot is proven." Rezzak argued that the killings could not be the result of a plot by just a handful of individuals. "Though a plot was frequently spoken about, nowhere in the trial ruling the specific names of the plotters are mentioned," said Rezzak. "The president phoned Rajarbagh Police Control Room, Gana Bhaban, Bangabhaban and many other places for help that night but nobody received the calls." He said: "Shafiullah had requested Bangabandhu to leave his home that night, but that request was just an act." "I questioned Shafiullah in the trial court about his role that night. He said that he had been 'at gunpoint' that night." "I said to him you had been the army chief for ... years at that point. Why should you be afraid of a gun pointing at you?" Rezzak repeated Shahriar Rashid was not involved with the killings at all. "The question is whether identifying Shahriar Rashid as a beneficiary of the event is enough to give him death sentence." "One cannot be given death sentence if one is not directly involved with a killing," he said. Rezzak said after Aug 15, 1975, the then BDR chief Kholilur Rahman was made chief of defence staff and Shahriar Rashid was appointed as Kholilur Rahman's staff officer. Both Kholilur Rahman and Shahriar Rashid had the same role on Aug 15, said Rezzak. "But Kholilur is the witness and Shahriar Rashid is the convict in the case." Rezzak also told reporters, after Tuesday's hearing, and citing examples of Indian Supreme Court rulings that the split High Court verdict in the Aug 15 case could not be termed "a complete ruling". "I have presented the inconsistencies of the High Court ruling before the court," he said. The High Court in its observation mentioned Shahriar Rashid as a "beneficiary" of the killings, he said. But, Rezzak said, on Gen Shafiullah's own statement the then army chief had talked with Bangabandhu last on Aug 15. "Bangabandhu had sought help from him. But he only said: 'Sir, can you get out of the house? Let me see what I can do for you.'" "These statements cannot be accepted from an army chief," Rezzak said. Two lawyers had so far concluded their arguments for their respective clients. Barrister Abdullah Al Mamun contended for retired Major Bazlul Hua and retired Lt Col A K M Mohiuddin (lancer). Advocate Khan Saifur Rahman argued for dismissed Lt Col Syed Faruk Rahman and retired Lt Col Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery). The freshly formed bench headed by Justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam began hearing the appeals on Mujib murder case on Oct 5. None was allowed to file a case immediately after the assassination of the independence architect Sheikh Mujib on Aug 15, 1975. The government of Khandker Mustaque Ahmed that was installed after the bloody military coup passed an ordinance in November that year indemnifying the perpetrators and closing the door on the possibility of a trial. The Awami League government revoked the indemnity ordinance in 1996 and cleared the way for the trial. Then, Sheikh Mujib's personal assistant Muhitul Islam filed a case on Oct 2, 1996 with Dhanmondi Police Station against 24 persons. On Nov 8, 1998, Dhaka sessions judge Golam Rasul awarded death sentences to 15 of the 20 accused. Four of the convictsMajor (retd) Bazlul Huda, Lt Col (dismissed) Syed Faruk Rahman, Lt Col (retd) Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Lt Col (retd) Mohiuddin Ahmedappealed to the High Court against the verdict. On Dec 14, 2000, the High Court gave a split verdict in the caseJustice Md Ruhul Amin upheld death sentences of 10 of the convicts but Justice A B M Khairul Haque retained death sentences of all the 15. On April 30, 2001 Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim of a third High Court bench upheld death sentences of 12 and acquitted three. Of the 12 death convicts, four appealed against their sentence in the Appellate Division in the same year. Another death convict, retired Lt Col (lancer) A K M Mohiuddin, made an appeal from jail after he was deported from the United States on June 18 last year. Of those having received death sentence, former Lt Col Abdur Rashid, Lt Col Shariful Haq Dalim, Lt Col Noor, Risalder Moslemuddin, Lt Col Rashed Chowdhury and Capt Majed are absconding. The detained death convicts are dismissed Lt Col Syed Faruk Rahman, retired Lt Col Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, retired Lt Col Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery), retired Major Bazlul Huda and retired Lt Col A K M Mohiuddin (lancer). Absconding convict Aziz Pasha died in exile in Zimbabwe. bdnews24
