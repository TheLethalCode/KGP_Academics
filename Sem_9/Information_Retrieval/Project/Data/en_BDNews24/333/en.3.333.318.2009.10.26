<TEXT>
 THE HAGUE, Oct 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic refused to attend the start of his war crimes trial on Monday saying he was not ready, and judges said they would impose a legal team on him if he failed to show up again. Karadzic, who has denied all 11 war crimes charges arising from the 1992-95 Bosnian war, including genocide, is representing himself and had threatened to boycott the start of the trial, saying he needed more time to prepare. Judge O-Gon Kwon said during the 15-minute proceedings that the trial would restart on Tuesday at 1315 GMT with the prosecution's opening statements and the court would assign lawyers to Karadzic if he refused to appear. "There are circumstances in which trials can proceed in the absence of the accused who has voluntarily waived his right to be present," the South Korean judge said. Judges are eager to get the trial of the tribunal's highest profile defendant under way after his arrest 15 months ago. The chair where Karadzic sat during pretrial proceedings at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia was empty, and because he had no legal representation other nearby chairs also were empty. The break-up of Yugoslavia in the 1990s saw some of the worst atrocities in Europe since World War Two as Serbs, Croats and Muslims fought for land. More than 100,000 people were killed in warfare and by such policies as "ethnic cleansing." Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb political leader, is charged with genocide over the massacre of about 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica in July 1995. He is also charged over the 43-month siege of the Bosnian capital Sarajevo by Serb forces, in which between 10,000 to 14,000 people were killed according to various estimates. Karadzic, who had been a psychiatrist specializing in neurosis and depression, went into hiding from 1996 after he was indicted by the tribunal and was discovered in Belgrade in July 2008 and extradited to The Hague. DISGUISED AS HEALER Serbian officials said he had lived for years under an alias, posing as an alternative healer, and showed photos of him unrecognizable behind long hair, thick glasses and a beard. His former military commander, General Ratko Mladic, is still a fugitive sought by the war crimes tribunal. In a statement, Prosecutor Hildegard Uertz-Retzlaff asked the court to issue Karadzic a warning before assigning counsel. "Thereafter, if the accused still refuses to appear for the commencement of trial, at that time the trial chamber should impose counsel on the accused," Uertz-Retzlaff said. Karadzic has claimed immunity from the war crimes charges, saying he made a secret deal with former US peace envoy Richard Holbrooke that he would not be prosecuted if he dropped out of public life. Holbrooke has repeatedly denied those claims and the ICTY has rejected Karadzic's claim of immunity. Protesters gathered outside the tribunal on Monday, shouting and venting frustration at Karadzic's boycott. Members of about 20 victims groups gathered around a banner with the names of 8,106 victims killed at Srebrenica and the words "Europe's shame." "It is a mockery," said Jasna Causevic, of the group Society for Threatened Peoples, about Karadzic's boycott, adding he was trying to control the tribunal. The battle of wills at the start of the trial was reminiscent of the trial of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who died in 2006 before his trial ended. Milosevic had also obstructed proceedings to buy time or gain concessi
