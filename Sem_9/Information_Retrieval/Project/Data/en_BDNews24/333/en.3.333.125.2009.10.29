<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)Finance minister AMA Muhith has said the government will continue to provide subsidies to the vital sectors even if it means setting aside International Monetary Fund management tips. "The IMF delegates raised questions about the government subsidising various sectors. They said we are providing excessive subsidies to some," he said after his meeting with the visiting IMF delegates on Thursday noon. "But we have told them clearly that to keep our economy stable and to provide it with a firm foothold, we will continue to provide support to the sectors that need it." Muhith said the IMF team endorsed the way the government has been managing the economy. "In some cases, we differed from what they tended to recommend." "They said our GDP growth this fiscal will not exceed 5.5 percent whereas we said it should not be less than 6, if not more." The IMF team forecast that inflation may increase further, he said, and the government promised to mount all efforts to rein in inflation. "The ADP implementation rate was slow, they said," Muhith told reporters. In response, the government said it had already adopted measures to accelerate the pace of development. "Amid global recession, our revenue netting has been satisfactory, the delegates said," the finance minister added. On the investment inertia, he said, "The IMF said our investment scenario does not seem commendable. We assured them that we are making every effort to increase investment." The global crunch has also affected Bangladesh's investment situation, said Muhith. The seven-member IMF delegation is headed by Masato Miyazaki, adviser to the Asia Pacific division of IMF. Masato said they would hold an official news conference in the afternoon. Prime minister's economic affairs adviser Moshiur Rahman, Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman and finance secretary Mohammed Tareq were present. bd
