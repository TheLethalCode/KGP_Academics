 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Oct 27 (bdnews24.com)The railway authorities are going to introduce a new and easy luggage handling facility for Dhaka-Kolkata Maitree train passengers, top officials have said. As per the proposed facility, Maitree passengers would be able to deposit their luggage to the railway staff at the starting station and collect the same at the destination. They say the new service would relieve passengers of the trouble of unloading their luggage at the bordering station for a second time customs checking and make it more comfortable for the travellers. They say the travel time of the train would also be slashed by 30 minutes more from November 1. "We have sent a letter to the Indian government on Oct 10, proposing introduction of a new luggage management system. "As per our proposal, passengers will deposit their luggage at the starting point (Dhaka or Kolkata) after customs formalities and collect them at the destination station," Md Belayet Hossain, director general of Bangladesh Railways, told bdnews24.com. He said the new rule would come into effect only after the Indian government approved the same. Md Shahjahan, a joint director general of BR on Monday told bdnews24.com that the new proposal would be discussed at a three-day meeting of the railway officials of the two countries scheduled for Nov 12-14 in Kolkata. The railway officials of the two governments identified five hours of customs inspection time as one of the main reasons for poor response from the train passengers between the two countries. Because, they say, most of the passengers do not like to sit idle for almost five hours at the bordering stations. And they do not feel comfortable to carry their luggage again to the border stations for rechecking. "We will also propose launching on-board customs facilities to reduce the travel time," said Shahjahan, who would be one of the officials expected to be in Bangladesh delegation at the coming talks. "From Nov 1, the Maitree train from Dhaka will reach Kolkata in 11 hours 15 minutes instead of 11 hours 45 minutes. "Because, the Indian authorities have rescheduled time of a local train which cost one hour more for the Kolkata-bound train than the Dhaka-bound ones," said Shahjahan. He said the train starting from Kolkata reaches Dhaka in 10 hours and 50 minutes. The railway management in Bangladesh and India have been trying to make the train service popular since its launching on April 14, 2008. Initially, the train used to take over 13 hours including five hours for customs and immigration formalities at two bordering stationstwo and half hours at Darsana (Bangladesh) and Gede (India). The railway authorities on Aug 1 reduced the time for customs and immigration formalities at the bordering stations to three hours instead of five hours. Besides, they changed the schedules of the train. From Aug 1, one Bangladesh train starts for Kolkata on Saturday and returns the next day. One Indian train leaves Kolkata for Dhaka on Tuesday and goes back on Wednesday. Earlier, one Bangladesh train used to start for Kolkata on Saturday and return the next day. Again, one Indian train reached Dhaka on Saturday and went back on Sunday. Railway officials identified the previous schedule as one of the causes for poor service of the train which at one stage on an average carried only 30 passengers per trip. According to the railway sources, 53 and 56 passengers traveled by the train on Oct 3 and 4. On Oct 24, 84 passengers traveled and the number rose to 100 on Oct 25. The distance between Dhaka and Kolkata is 398 kilometres--278 km inside Bangladesh and 120 km on the Indian side
