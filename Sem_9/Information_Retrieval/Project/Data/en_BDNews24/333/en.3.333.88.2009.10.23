 LOS ANGELES, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rockers Bon Jovi on Thursday announced a world tour of almost two years to promote their 11th studio album "The Circle". The Grammy-award winning band, one of the top five touring acts worldwide in 2008, will perform 135 shows in 30 countries starting in Seattle in February 2010. The tour includes a "residency" in June 2010 at the O2 arena in London, following a trend blazed by Prince who played 21 nights at the O2 in 2007 and the planned run of 50 concerts by Michael Jackson before his sudden death in June. Bon Jovi is expected to play at least five dates in London. "The Circle" will be released on November 12 on Island Records, a unit of Vivendi SA's Universal Music Group. Bon Jovi has already secured an unusual promotional deal with NBC Universal which will feature the band and the new album heavily on NBC network and cable TV channels, news networks and digital brands throughout November. The band has sold more than 120 million albums worldwide in its two decade career and performed live for more than 34 million fans around the globe. Tickets for the tour go on sale on Nov
