<TEXT>
 GENEVA, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Negotiations to open up global commerce have made no real progress lately and are moving too slowly to hit the target of a Doha Round deal by 2010, the head of the World Trade Organisation said on Friday. "We have not yet seen tangible progress in the negotiations and, overall, I would say that the current speed with which we are advancing is too slow ... to be in a position to wrap this round next year," WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy said. He was addressing a meeting of the WTO's 153 members after a week of intensive meetings and negotiations aiming for a breakthrough in the talks, now in their eighth year.
