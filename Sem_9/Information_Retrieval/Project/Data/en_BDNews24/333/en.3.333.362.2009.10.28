 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com)The tax return deadline will not be extended again this year, the top taxman said Wednesday. "The deadline will not be stretched any more unless some unforeseen situation occurs," National Board of Revenue chairman Nasir Uddin Ahmed told a press conference. "We gave TIN holders another whole month in October to pay," Nasir said. Hoping to net more returns this year, the NBR extended the previous Sept 30 deadline by one more month to Oct 31. "We have been getting a good response in the last stretch," said Ahmed. Last year, the Sep 30 deadline was extended twice, by a month each time, up to Nov 30. There are more than 22 lakh TIN holders in Bangladesh, but only a third paid up last year, said Ahmed. "We are hoping that the number will increase this time," he said. Since Oct 31 falls on a Saturday, the weekend, tax payers will be able to submit returns the day after, on Nov 1. But they will also be able to submit on the Saturday. All offices of NBR will be open on Oct 31. "We have also requested Bangladesh Bank to give banks instructions to keep their branches open on that Saturday," the chairman said. Around 7.39 lakh people paid income tax last year. Finance minister AMA Muhith said recently the number was too low, describing it as "shameful". The minister has said surveys would be carried out in 15 areas of the country to help net more taxpayers. He has also unveiled plans to prevent tax evasion, collect tax from all TIN holders and catch those with fake TINs. In an Income Tax Day programme recently, he said the government had set a target to collect income tax worth Tk 20,000 crore in the last fiscal year of its tenure. In the 2008-2009, the NBR netted around Tk 13,812 crore in income tax. bd
