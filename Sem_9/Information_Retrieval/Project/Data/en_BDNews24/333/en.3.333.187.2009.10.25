 Dhaka, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong Medical College closed it doors until further notice on Saturday after pro-ruling party Chhatra League and pro Jamaat-e-Islami Chhatra Shibir clashed violently on campus. Male students left their hostel by 8pm as directed by university authorities, principal Gofranul Haque said. Female students will have to leave their hostel by 8am Sunday. "The violence was sparked between Chhatra League and Shibir at around 3:30pm over bringing freshers into their organisations," said Haque. The rioting students, some with faces concealed behind hoods and masks, torched 15 rooms and further vandalised over 50. Police were forced to charge with batons and fire tear gas shells to bring the situation under control. Authorities and student leaders said at least 15 were injured during the two hours of violence that. They were admitted to Chittagong Medical College Hospital and nearby clinics. Of them, at least six were of Chhatra League and five Chhatra Shibir. Students said Chhatra League brought out a parade for newly admitted first year students to encourage them to join their numbers. Chhatra Shibir countered with a procession of its own. Heated arguments were exchanged between members of the two organisations leading to chase and counter-chase though no clashes occurred initially. Both organisations later held rallies inside a hostel, at which point violent fighting broke out with both sides equipped with rods, sticks and bricks. The clashes running up to 5:30pm spread out to nearby Chatteshwari Road and Chalkbazar area. Locals were panicked while vehicles were forced to a stop for around one and half hours, said police. Sub-inspector of Panchlaish police Abdullah Al Mamun told bdnews24.com that the situation was eventually brought under control as adequate numbers of police were deployed and students started leaving the campus. He also said no one was arrested yet and neither side had lodged any complaint with his station. CMC's Chhatra League president Tanvir Ahmed claimed: "Shibir workers attacked us premeditatedly on the pretext of congratulating students admitted to the MBBS course." "They torched and vandalised the rooms of Chhatra League students." "They rampaged through the hall with the help of outsiders after they were driven out of the hall by general students." CMC's Shibir president Sazzadur Rahman, in turn, accused the Chhatra League of attacking them on the same pretext of congratulating freshers. He told bdnews24.com: "The Chhatra League even attacked leaders and workers of the city chapter of Chhatra Shibir who were holding a procession Chhatteshwari Road's Chalkbazar-Gulzar crossing." bdnews24.
