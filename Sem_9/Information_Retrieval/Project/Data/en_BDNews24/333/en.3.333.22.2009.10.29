 Dhaka, Oct 29 (bdnews24.com)There has been a better response from the entrepreneurs, specially from abroad, for participation in the forthcoming 15th Dhaka International Trade Fair compared to last year's experience, the organizers claimed. Business leaders and officials of Export Promotion Bureau, the main organiser of the event, said enthusiastic response this year indicates the business world is shaking off its torpor it had slumped into during the army backed emergency regime. Mir Nasir Hossain, former FBCCI (Federation of Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industries) president told bdnews24.com, "Last year's fair was held during the caretaker government's rule when our business activities had almost been frozen." "This year the fair is being organised during an elected regime. Naturally, the responses should be manifold and spontaneous too." AN EPB official said, the number of interested applicants willing to set up stalls and pavilions last year was much less than the offered space and facilities; even a second call inviting interested parties ended up with 11 pavilions unoccupied. This year, the picture is quite different, he said, adding that the authorities had to go for selection since the number of applicants in the 'foreign' category was more than the available space. In the last year's fair, four of the premier pavilions and only two out of the 10 premier mini pavilions could be allotted to participants. Following the second call last year, 575 interested companies had applied against 478 stalls and pavilions, of which foreign applicants numbered only 22. The month-long DITF has been held in January every year since 1995 at the Sher-e-Bangla Nagar ground participated by a wide range of trade and industrial companies from home and abroad. The ministry of commerce and the EPB jointly organise the fair. EPB vice chairman Shahab Ullah told bdnews24.com, "This year we have received much better response from the business communities." EPB deputy director and trade fair secretariat member Syed Belal Hossain said, the total number of applicants willing to set up stalls and restaurants at DITF 2010 is 466 and in the pavilion category some 764 applications have been received. He said 587 applications were received against 307 stalls, 87 applications for 61 pavilions and 49 applications came for 40 mini pavilions. Of the foreign applicantions received, 32 were for stalls and nine for premier and mini pavilions, he said. He told bdnews24.com, "Comparatively more applications were received under the foreign category this year. A total of some 32 organisations from 10 countries, including India, Pakistan, Iran and Nepal, have dropped applications, Belal said. He said already five premier pavilions at the rate of Tk 7.5 lakh each and four premier mini pavilions at the rate of Tk 5.25 lakh each have been finally allotted. DITF showcases Bangladesh's export products to visitors and bring together entrepreneurs from home and abroad to promote international trade. The wide range of products include woven and knitwear wears, jute, leather and agro products, frozen foods, handicrafts, ceramic ware, pharmaceutical and chemical products, machinery, furniture, building materials etc. Knitwear exporters, however, said this fair doesn't benefit them much. Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BKMEA) president Fazlul Haq told bdnews24.com, "The DITF has never made any contribution to increase exports. No foreign buyers visit the fair. We too don't find it interesting." Bangladesh Handicrafts Manufacturers and Exporters Association president Golam Ahsan said, "We have refrained from participating at the DITF for the last three-four years. We don't think this fair promotes our exports." The DITF, like every year in the past, will be staged over a sprawling area of 20 acres beside the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre at Sher-e-Bangala Nagar. Syed Belal Hossain said, "On an average last year, the DITF saw around one lakh visitors daily and about two to two and a half lakh on the weekends and holidays." On the products sales at DITF, he claimed, that many participating companies had received spot orders for various items worth about Tk 40 crore last year. Shahab Ullah hoped this year's sales would be much higher compared to last year. bdn
