 Dhaka, Oct 28 (bdnews24.com)  Excessive cricket is not only a concern for players' burnout but is also creating spectators' fatigue, warned former Australian wicketkeeper batsman Adam Gilchrist, reports PTI. He said the cricket administrators need to strike a right balance to keep the players as well as fans involved with the game. "The schedule has been very compact and hectic, especially in the last 6 weeks. Potentially, too much cricket is being played by all countries. It is also creating spectators' fatigue.

"Ricky Ponting is a wonderful example of how to manage one's workload," said the inspirational Deccan Chargers' skipper, who guided the Hyderabad team to the second Indian Premier League title in South Africa earlier this year. Gilchrist also brushed aside fears that Test cricket is in danger of extinction, instead he feels ODIs and Twenty20s will only help in enhancing the traditional version of the
