 OSAKA, Japan, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - American Allyson Felix defended her 200 metres world title in style on Friday, streaking down the home straight to win gold by over half a second in the first sub-22 second run of her career. Felix dashed across the line in 21.81 seconds -- the quickest time at a world championships final since 1999 -- to match Jamaican Marlene Ottey in winning back-to-back world 200m golds. "This one is really special," Felix, the youngest athlete to claim a sprint world title when she won as a 19-year-old in Helsinki two years ago, told reporters. "I've been at 22 seconds as long as I can remember and to win the title at the same time is really exciting. It ranks as the top, it's really been a long time and I've been patient." World 100m and Olympic 200m champion Veronica Campbell looked to be in with a chance of a sprint double at the bend but Felix stormed past her and the Jamaican took silver in a season's best 22.34. "For the last 100 metres, she was on her own," said Campbell. The 0.53 seconds between Felix and Campbell was the biggest margin of victory in the event at a world championships. Sri Lanka's 31-year-old Susanthika Jayasinghe also finished strongly to snatch a fairytale bronze from American Torri Edwards in 22.63 -- a decade after winning her last world championship medal by finishing second in Athens. After Aleen Brady false started, Campbell got the edge on Felix from the blocks and swiftly built a slight lead over the woman she beat to Olympic gold in Athens. Felix was not going to be knocked out of her rhythm, however, and came flying off the bend at a pace that none of her rivals could match and she was well clear when she crossed the line. "After my start, which was not the best as usual, I just stayed focused," Felix said. "I knew that I have a strong finish, that I really had to take it off on the home stretch." Jayasinghe has had a long but often troubled career with frequent disqualifications for running out of her lane and a doping ban. Running sixth at the bend, she put in a powerful finish to pip Edwards by two hundredths of a second. "In the last two years my performances have dropped because of a stress fracture," she said. "For the future, I now dream about Olympic gold. I believe in myself.
