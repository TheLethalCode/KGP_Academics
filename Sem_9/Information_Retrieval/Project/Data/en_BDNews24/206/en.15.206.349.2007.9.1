 JODHPUR, India, Sep 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A court in Rajasthan freed actor Salman Khan on bail on Friday almost a week after he was arrested and jailed for shooting an endangered gazelle during hunting trips nearly a decade ago. He walked free on Friday evening, wearing a blue-grey baseball cap, a white shirt and jeans. A crowd of policemen escorted him to a black sports utility vehicle waiting outside the jail. Further away, hundreds of fans cheered for their idol. He will fly back home to Mumbai, some media reports said. The court also ordered the actor to deposit a personal bond of 100,000 rupees ($2,500). He had spent his time in jail reading, exercising and sketching, a prison official told a local news channel.

Renowned for his bad-boy image and romantic liaisons with several Bollywood actresses, Khan has several other cases hanging over him. He was convicted in 2006 for killing protected blackbuck antelopes during the Rajasthan hunting trips and given a one-year jail sentence. He was granted bail while he appeals against that conviction. He has also been charged with other counts of killing wildlife and of breaking gun laws. Khan is also facing trial over the death of a man sleeping on a pavement in Mumbai in 2002. Khan is suspected of drunk-driving. The actor has denied being at the wheel. Khan, also known for his slapstick comedy, stars in three movies that are under production costing in total about 1 billion rupees ($24 million), industry analysts s
