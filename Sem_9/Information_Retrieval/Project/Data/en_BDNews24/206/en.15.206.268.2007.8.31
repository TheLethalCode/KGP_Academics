 Dhaka, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com)  Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury Friday termed the caretaker government 'conscience of the nation' and said the interim government wanted to purge the country of corruption forever. "As the conscience of the nation, the present caretaker government wants to root out corruption for ever. The process (curbing corruption) has already started and none of the corrupt will be spared." Iftekhar made the remarks at a discussion meeting marking the 89 anniversary of birth of General MAG Osmani, commander-in-chief of the war of independence, at the National Press Club auditorium in the city. The foreign adviser attended the meeting on "Expectation of the War of Independence and the role of freedom fighters in curbing corruption" organised by Bangladesh Freedom Fighter Journalists Forum. He sought cooperation from all for the ongoing drive against corruption. He recalled the contribution of Gen Osmani in the independence war and building the nation, and paid tribute to the veteran warrior and politician. The meeting was also addressed, among others, by former army chief Lt Gen Mahbubur Rahman, president of Bangladesh Economic Association Qazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmad, Major Gen (Retd) C R Dutta, Justice Golam Rabbani and the Hunger Project chief Dr Badiul Alam Majumder. Osmani was born on September 1, 1918 and played the key role in defeating the Pakistani occupation army during the liberation war in 1971. In April 1972, he resigned from Bangladesh army and joined the cabinet headed by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. He died in 1984. bdn
