 YANGON, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Some dissidents arrested in a fierce crackdown on protests in military-ruled Myanmar have gone on hunger strike over police refusal to treat a protester with a broken leg, an activist said on Friday. Prominent democracy campaigner Suu Suu Nway, roughed up when a pro-junta gang broke up a march on Aug. 28, said fellow demonstrator Ye Thein Naing had been beaten and punched, and then had his leg broken when he was pushed off a truck. He was being held with 60 others at a police camp in Yangon, the commercial capital, said Suu Suu Nway, who narrowly escaped arrest and has gone into hiding. "I heard him shout in pain," she told Reuters by telephone. "He still has not had his broken leg plastered, so some decided to stage a hunger strike." The opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) says more than 100 people have been detained in one of the harshest crackdowns in the former Burma since a mass uprising in 1988 led by students and Buddhist monks. Most of the leaders of the 1988 protests, including Min Ko Naing, the second most influential dissident after detained Nobel laureate and NLD chief Aung San Suu Kyi, have been picked up and the generals are tightening the net on those still at large. Travellers said buses were being stopped and searched on the road to Mandalay and the Thai border, an escape route used by many activists after the 1988 crackdown, in which as many as 3,000 people are thought to have been killed. Police and plainclothes government agents have also launched a Yangon-wide manhunt for known dissidents, raiding their homes and distributing their photographs to hotels, guesthouses, police stations and government offices. FORCED TO LEAVE BABY One woman on the wanted list, Ma Nilar -- another member of the so-called "88 Generation Students Group" -- had been forced to leave her four-month-old baby daughter and go into hiding, a friend told Reuters. Ma Nilar's husband is Ko Jimmy, one of 12 leading dissidents rounded up with Min Ko Naing. They are in Yangon's notorious Insein prison facing sedition charges that could see them sentenced to up to 20 years in jail. The crackdown has been criticised severely by the United States and Europe, and registered "concern" on the radar of Myanmar's southeast Asian neighbours, who have always favoured "constructive engagement" over Western-style sanctions. China, the closest energy-rich Myanmar has to a friend, has remained silent. The sporadic series of protests seems to be dying down in Yangon, although two students in Taunggok, 250 miles (400 km) to the northwest in coastal Rakhine State, staged a 15-minute placard protest before being arrested, Yangon-based sources said. NLD sources said 20 party members had marched in Kyaukpadaung, 400 miles northwest of Yangon, on Thursday and another dozen had demonstrated for more than an hour in Mandalay. Separately, delegates at a National Convention which first met 14 years ago to draw up a new constitution said they had completed the "detailed basic principles" of the charter, and the convention would have a formal closing ceremony on Monday. A drafting committee would then write the constitution, but no time frame has been made public yet. The generals trumpet the convention as the first stage in a seven-step "roadmap to democracy". Western governments dismiss it as a sham designed to cement the army's grip on power. The world's largest rice exporter when it won independence from Britain in 1948, Myanmar is now one of Asia's poorest countries. Suu Kyi, whose NLD party won a 1990 election by a landslide only to be denied power by the military, has spent nearly 12 of the last 17 years in prison or under house arre
