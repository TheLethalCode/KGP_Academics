 TAIPEI, Sept 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Taiwan has strongly rejected comments by a senior White House official that its plan to hold a referendum on United Nations membership was "perplexing" as the island was not a formal state and therefore could not join. The exchange is just the latest evidence of strained ties between Taipei and Washington, which earlier this week expressed fears the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) referendum plan could be a precursor to a declaration of independence. China sees self-ruled, democratic Taiwan as part of its territory rather than as a separate country and has warned that it would use force to prevent moves toward formal sovereignty. Dennis Wilder, US National Security Council Senior Director for Asian Affairs, responding to media questions at a White House briefing on Thursday, said Taiwan did not qualify to join the United Nations. "Membership in the United Nations requires statehood. Taiwan, or the Republic of China, is not at this point a state in the international community," Wilder said. While Washington is Taiwan's main ally and is committed to assisting in its defence, it has become increasingly engaged with Beijing on economic and security issues, and says the island is dangerously provoking China by pressing for membership. Taiwan's foreign ministry hit back at Wilder's remarks, saying the island's statehood was undeniable. "Taiwan is a sovereign independent country, of that there is no doubt. This fact will not be altered by the comments of an official from foreign country," a ministry statement said late on Friday. Wilder questioned the DPP's motives in planning to hold a referendum alongside presidential elections next March on whether the island should seek UN membership. "We find the attempts by the DPP party in Taiwan to call for a referendum of this subject a little bit perplexing as to why this would be useful, given the fact that Taiwan is not going to be able to join the United Nations under current circumstances," Wilder said. "It only adds a degree of tension to cross-straits relations that we deem unnecessary." The United Nations, which ousted Taipei in favour of Beijing in 1971 under a "one China" policy, rejected the island's most recent bid last month. Taiwan stands virtually no chance as China is a permanent member of the UN Security Council with veto power
