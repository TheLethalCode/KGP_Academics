<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com)  John Harmer, the Australian who has thrown himself in the fray to coach Bangladesh, Friday made a five-hour presentation before five-member coach selection panel of Bangladesh Cricket Board. Emerging from the BCB conference room, the 65-year old Australian coach said to waiting journalists with a smile, "I have played a long innings." The senior coach of the Australian Commonwealth Bank Cricket Academy also presented his plans for Bangladesh cricket. He said his presentation went well. "The presentation was very good. We have also discussed much on these matters." On his chances of getting the job, the Aussie with highest coaching degree did not say anything directly. "For the time being I can say so far that if I get the job I will be able to handle it well." Harmer, however, will have to wait for long to know if he will get the job as the BCB is not going to make a decision soon. Two other short-listed candidates in Jimmie Siddons and David Houghton are yet to be interviewed. The BCB may consider some others as well. Chairman of Cricket Operations Committee Gazi Ashraf Lipu said, "Harmer has been told that we will take a decision after interviewing some more candidates." If selected, Harmer said he will make a long-term plan for Bangladesh. On his immediate goal, he said, "I will try to improve the position of Bangladesh cricket, which is my first target. I think Bangladesh's ranking is now number 8. I will target clinching number 7 position." bdnews24
