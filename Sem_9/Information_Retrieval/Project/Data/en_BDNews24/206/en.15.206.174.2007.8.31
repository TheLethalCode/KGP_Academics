 MILAN, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Inter Milan forward Alvaro Recoba has signed for Torino on loan, the Serie A clubs said on Friday, making it unlikely that Adriano will leave Inter before the transfer deadline shuts. Uruguayan Recoba, who has spent 10 years at the San Siro, including a loan spell at Venezia, had been knocked down the pecking order at the Italian champions given their array of attacking talent. Torino and Inter announced the loan deal on their Web sites (www.torinofc.it and www.inter.it) Inter President Massimo Moratti said earlier this week that he would only let one of either Recoba and Adriano leave and that the Brazilian could only go out on loan. England's West Ham United held talks with Inter about Adriano while Manchester City, Lazio and Parma have also expressed an interest. Adriano, who has lost his place in the Inter and Brazil sides after two years of patchy form and weight problems, has said he would only consider a permanent move away and would prefer to stay and fight for his place at Inter
