 NAZRAN, Russia, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A blast killed three police and injured two on Friday in a blast in Nazran, the capital of Russia's southern province of Ingushetia, which borders Chechnya, Ingushi officials said. Officials in the province, where violent attacks against police and officials have become more frequent recently, gave conflicting accounts of what had happened. "It was a terrorist act," a duty officer at the regional prosecutors' office told Reuters by telephone. But the interior ministry ruled this out, saying a car accident caused the blast. The officer from the prosecutors' office said a police patrol in a jeep was dispatched to check reports that a Russian-made Lada car packed with explosives was parked next to the cultural centre in the town's centre. "When police approached the Lada, it blew up," he said. "There was virtually nothing left of the Lada car," he added. "The explosion occurred when they approached the Lada," the officer said. "Three policemen were killed and two were injured." Russian news agencies said one of the injured policemen was in a critical state in hospital. A series of recent attacks against officials and police, blamed on Islamist rebels, has heightened security fears in Ingushetia. Earlier this month 2,500 troops were sent to the region to support local security forces. Security measures became especially tight ahead of Sept 1, when school year starts in Russia. A big school is located next to the scene of the blast. The Interior ministry gave its own account of what had happened. A ministry spokesman said a police jeep collided with the Lada car, which ran on gas. "This was a car accident," he said. "The Lada's gas canister exploded after the collision with the jeep."
