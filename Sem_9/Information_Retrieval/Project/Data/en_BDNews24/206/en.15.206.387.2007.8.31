 ANKARA, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkey's re-elected AK Party unveiled a five-year government programme on Friday that pledges to push ahead with stalled reforms to steer it towards EU membership, trim taxes and preserve fiscal discipline. The new government programme was in line with the manifesto with which the AK Party, which has roots in political Islam, won a sweeping re-election in July. Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan has promised to continue his pro-business reform agenda of recent years, aimed at maintaining economic growth, lower unemployment and lower inflation but boosting per capita annual income to $10,000 from the current $5,500. "Our government will continue structural reforms with determination in the coming period," he told parliament. "We will continue to develop an inflation-targeting regime." The previous AK Party government cut inflation to single digits for the first time in a generation, raising annual growth to 7 percent as Turkey recovered from a 2001 financial crisis. It also followed a policy of fiscal discipline, although in the run-up to the election economists said spending ballooned. Erdogan's new cabinet list was approved by President Abdullah Gul on Wednesday, a day after the former foreign minister was elected by parliament as head of state. Erdogan brought into his cabinet a few pro-EU, pro-reform ministers, particularly Mehmet Simsek in charge of the economy. But critics say the cabinet was packed with close allies of Erdogan, with more conservative and religious backgrounds. The lira firmed two percent to 1.2970 against the dollar on the interbank market, while Istanbul's main share index broke the 50,000 points level, up 4.4 percent on global market gains. The European Commission has urged Erdogan to press ahead fast with stalled reforms required for membership of the bloc. Parts of negotiations were frozen last year over Ankara's refusal to open its ports to Cypriot traffic. Brussels is set to publish a progress report on Turkey on Nov. 8 and Ankara hopes a series of reforms may give it a better report, although time may be too short for this, diplomats say. The government plans to re-submit a series of laws, such as a IMF-sought social security reform to trim the welfare deficit. It also plans to re-submit laws required by the EU, including one on returning previously confiscated property of foundations established by minorities. Staunchly secular Ahmet Necdet Sezer, who stepped down as president this week, blocked these laws. The government has not yet mentioned any moves on more difficult issues, namely addressing Cyprus or removing a controversial bill that Brussels says limits free speech. Gul, who has courted controversy because of his past in political Islam, is expected to back these laws. The AK Party plans to push ahead with a new civilian constitution that aims to boost democracy and the rule of law, and expand individual freedoms. The new constitution will be debated in parliament over the next few months, a reform likely to irritate the powerful armed forces but delight the EU. The government plans to trim taxes to boost Turkey's competitiveness, as well as reduce taxes on employment. Businesses have long called for these cuts to improve conditions for companies, increasingly hurt by Asian competition. The government programme reiterated the importance of price stability and a free exchange rate regime. The AK Party said inflation, currently double the central bank's year-end target of four percent, had to come down. "We cannot be satisfied with reducing inflation to single-digit levels. Our goal is permanent price stability," Erdogan said. Erdogan repeated his wish to bring down interest rates, which are currently among the highest in emerging markets. "Our government's goal is to reduce nominal interest rates to single-digit levels in the coming period," he said. Parliament is expected to approve the programme next week as the AK Party has a majority of seats in the chamb
