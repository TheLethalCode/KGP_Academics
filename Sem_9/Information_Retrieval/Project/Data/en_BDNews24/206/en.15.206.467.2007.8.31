<TITLE> Dell tops estimates but sees cost declines slowing </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 31 - (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Dell, the world's second-largest personal computer maker, said Thursday its quarterly profit rose a higher-than-expected 46 percent as it benefited from lower component costs. But Dell predicted there would be smaller second-half declines in the cost of components such as disk drives and microprocessors, crimping its profits. It also delayed resuming stock buybacks until after it files overdue financial reports with regulators in early November. Dell shares rose less than 1 percent in after-hours trading following the earnings report, having closed up 60 cents, or 2.2 percent, at $28.46. The stock is up 7 percent this year. Operating profit margin slipped to 6 percent from 6.5 percent in the three months ended May 4. But the margin gained nearly 2 percentage points from the year-earlier period, when growth was slowing and profit margins were shrinking. "It's quite a different company" from a year ago, said Kim Caughey, vice president and senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, which oversees about $1.2 billion of investments, including Dell shares. "Dell is definitely a beneficiary of quickly dropping component prices," Caughey added. "They are also trying to set achievable targets for themselves." Net income in Dell's fiscal second quarter increased to $733 million, or 32 cents per share, from a reported $502 million, or 22 cents per share, a year ago. Revenue rose to $14.77 billion from a reported $14.1 billion a year earlier. The Round Rock, Texas-based company said the figures were preliminary because it is restating some prior periods after a year-long accounting audit that concluded this month. Analysts, on average, had expected earnings per share of 30 cents and revenue of $14.62 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Dell, which announced a 10 percent staff cut in May, said it would continue to cut jobs as part of cost-reduction efforts. Dell, like competitors Hewlett-Packard Co and Apple Inc, profited from lower costs for computer components amid a supply glut. HP, the top PC maker by market share, also suggested this month that component cost reductions may slow. Dell's profit was reduced by $102 million, or 3 cents per share, due to payments to its former CEO and 400 employees for stock options that could not be exercised during its audit, which found that executives adjusted accounts to meet financial targets. Dell also recorded $59 million, or 2 cents per share, for costs related to the audit in the second quarter. Dell said this month it expected to restate four years of results, reducing net income by $50 million to $150 million and revenue by 1 percent or less per year for that period. Led by founder Michael Dell, 42, the company in June departed from a 22-year strategy of selling directly to buyers and started selling PCs in retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc in the Americas and stores in Britain and Japan. Dell's retail expansion comes after HP displaced it last year as global PC market share leader, thanks partly to sales of notebook computers in retail stores and a greater presence overseas. Dell's second-quarter notebook computer sales rose by only about 5.4 percent from a year earlier, while HP two weeks ago reported a 54 percent jump in quarterly notebook revenue. Dell shares trade at 21 times expected 2007 earnings per share, compared with HP's 17 and Sun Microsystems Inc's 38. Dell shares' recent gains show "people were investing in a rising-tide-lifts-all-boats" strategy, said Jane Snorek, an analyst with First American Funds in Minneapolis, which manages about $66 billion of investments, including Dell shares. The sequential margin decline `is terrible', she added, and may lead analysts to cut profitability forecasts for coming quarters. Dell said it had a higher-than-normal product backlog, partly due to strong demand for new color notebooks, suggesting revenue may beat expectations this quarter, Snorek said. The company said in May it expected fiscal second-quarter operating margins to be `under pressure' sequentially as it entered a seasonally slower quarter with higher operating expenses and costs related to the accounting investigations. Dell said this month that 125 lawyers and 250 accountants reviewed more than 5 million documents and conducted more than 200 interviews of employees in an audit that began in August 2006. Remedial measures, including firings, were being take
