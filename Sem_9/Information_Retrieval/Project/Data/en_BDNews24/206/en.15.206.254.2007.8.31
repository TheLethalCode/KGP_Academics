<TITLE> EU must unite over Kosovo if talks fail: envoy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 VIENNA, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The chances of an agreement on Kosovo between Serbs and Albanians are slim and the European Union must not split over how to deal with the consequences in December if negotations fail, EU envoy Wolfgang Ischinger said on Friday. In an interview with Der Standard newspaper after launching a new round of talks in Vienna, the veteran diplomat said: "it would be a disaster if we allow this issue to divide" the 27-member Union. An agreement on the future of the breakaway Serbian province would be "a thousand times better than any unilateral solution", said Ischinger. "But realistically the chances of achieving this after all that has happened are rather slim." Ischinger and fellow mediators from the United States and Russia have until Dec. 10 to find a compromise between the Kosovo Albanian demand for full independence and Serbia's refusal to concede anything beyond wide autonomy to the province, run by the United Nations and NATO for the past 8 years. The Serbs are leaning on Russia for diplomatic support and the Kosovo Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the territory's population, place their hopes mainly on the United States. But Ischinger said both know that in the long run their future, economically and politically, is far close to the EU than Washington or Moscow. He acknowledged that a number of EU member states have "great concerns and difficulties" with how to handle a unilateral declaration of independence by Kosovo, which diplomats say is a strong possibility if no accord is reached. "In spite of that, they all know that we must be united otherwise the credibility of the (EU's) common foreign and security policy will be really seriously endangered." Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Friday Russia would accept a partition of Serbia if that is what both Belgrade and Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority agreed to. In Kosovo, Prime Minister Agim Ceku told visiting German Defence Minister Franz Josef Jung that his aim is independence before the year ends and "to achieve that the German support is essential, because German is the heart of the EU". "We prefer recognition to be based on a United Nations resolution, but we cannot wait until all UN Security Council members agree," he said. "We are ready, in the absence of a UN Security Council resolution ....to declare independence and ask for recognition by the EU and the United State
