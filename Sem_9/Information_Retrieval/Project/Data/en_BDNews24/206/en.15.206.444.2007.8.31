<TITLE> France: world trade deal unlikely in near future </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JOUY-EN-JOSAS, France, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The size of the gap between the parties involved in world trade negotiations means an agreement is unlikely in the near future, French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said on Thursday. Lagarde, speaking in a panel discussion at a conference near Paris organized by the French employers' federation MEDEF, said higher demand and a greater scarcity of supplies of a number of farm products had changed the conditions under which a farm deal -- a key part of an overall trade accord -- might be reached. She also said she doubted whether the Bush administration would be able to win authorization from the US Congress to seal a global trade agreement. Negotiators will return to the World Trade Organization in Geneva next week to resume long-running talks launched in Doha, Qatar, in 2001, aimed at reaching a new world trade deal involving a range of tariff and subsidy cuts and market-opening measures. Failure to secure the outlines of an agreement in the next couple of months would take the negotiations into the US presidential election period in 2008, when Washington would have less room to maneuver. "I think that the gap between the positions of some and the concessions of others is too big to be able to envisage an agreement in the near future," Lagarde said, without giving details. In Washington, the office of U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab on Thursday distributed excerpts of an interview Schwab gave to foreign reporters on Wednesday in which she also expressed doubts about a deal. "I think there is a recognition that we're starting to run out of options when it comes to the Doha round," Schwab said. She expressed concerns about the reaction of Brazil, India and other leading developing countries to a pair of draft texts released last month by the Geneva-based chairman of the agriculture and industrial goods negotiating groups. The reactions range from demanding major changes in the draft texts to a refusal by Argentina, Venezuela and some others to negotiate at all based on the texts, Schwab said. "That could really derail the Doha talks," she said. French President Nicolas Sarkozy said earlier that Europe could not be expected to obey rules of fair competition if other countries did not. Speaking on the same panel with Lagarde, EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson said he was "very worried" by the "simplistic" tone of much discussion of world trade issues. "If our response to the lack of openness that we see in others is to close and start creating some form of 'Fortress Europe,' what will be the response of others?" he said. "It will be a Fortress United States, it will be a Fortress China, it will be a Fortress India, it will be Fortress Brazil," he said. "I'm very worried about thi
