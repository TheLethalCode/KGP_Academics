<TITLE> Talks with parties can be held despite ban: Sakhawat </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Rangpur, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com)  Election commissioner Sakhawat Hossain said Friday talks on electoral reforms with the political parties can go ahead even if a ban on indoor politics was in force. "Talks are set to begin on Sept. 12. We can go ahead with the plan despite the ban is in place," Sakhawat said during a views exchange meeting in the district headquarters with common people. He was hopeful that the elections would be held by the end of next year in line with the EC-announced roadmap. "The elections would definitely be held by the end of 2008 on the basis of an electoral roll with photographs. We don't want an election that triggers panic. "We want a free and fair voting. The commission is working to meet that target," Sakhawat said. He said they were preparing a fresh electoral roll with photographs since the previous one was highly disputed. "If there was an election with that roll it would not be acceptable. So the new electoral roll is being prepared." Sakhawat said all the political parties must register with the EC. "Otherwise, unregistered parties will not be allowed to contest in the polls." bdnews2
