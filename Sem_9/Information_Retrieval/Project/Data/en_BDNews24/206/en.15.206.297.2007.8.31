<TITLE> China military vexes Japan despite minister's visit </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan will keep pressing China for details on its military spending, its defence minister said on Friday, as media saw a rare visit by his Chinese counterpart as doing little to erase mutual suspicions over military ambitions. Cao Gangchuan's five-day visit is the first by a Chinese defence minister to Japan in almost a decade after top-level military exchanges were halted due to tensions over a range of issues, mainly relating to Japan's past military aggression. With ties having warmed since Shinzo Abe took over as Japan's prime minister last September, Cao and Japanese Defence Minister Masahiko Komura agreed on Thursday to allow a first-ever visit by a Chinese warship to Japan and to try to set up a crisis hotline. But Komura was quoted as saying there had been no concrete examples from Cao of how Beijing planned to improve transparency about its military spending. "We will persistently bring up (the transparency issue) at each meeting," Komura was quoted by Kyodo news as telling a news conference. China said in March it would boost defence spending by 17.8 percent to about $45 billion this year, but a U.S. Pentagon report in May said Beijing's total military-related spending could be more than twice that. Japanese media said suspicions over the lack of transparency showed no sign of letting up. "It is only natural for other countries, including Japan, to become increasingly concerned about China's recent military trend," the Yomiuri daily said in an editorial. Without a breakdown of China's defence spending in line with international standards, doubts would not subside, the conservative Sankei Shimbun added. "Japan should work to build trust with China through dialogue, but its core policy is its alliance with the United States," the paper said in an editorial. FANNING MISTRUST The liberal Asahi newspaper, however, also warned against fanning China's mistrust with talk of closer ties among four regional democracies -- Japan, the United States, India and Australia -- a move that Beijing sees as containment. Sino-Japanese ties, long plagued by memories of Japan's invasion of parts of China in the early 20th century, soured to their worst state in decades under Abe's predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi. Koizumi angered Beijing during his five years in office by making annual visits to a shrine where wartime leaders are honoured along with war dead. Abe moved quickly to repair ties, but since a disastrous upper house election defeat last month he has again sought to woo conservatives suspicious of China. "There have been moves by Japan appearing to contain China, such as Prime Minister Abe's diplomatic policy based on common values and upcoming military exercises with the United States, India and Australia," an Asahi editorial said. "Japan must not forget that the main point of diplomacy should be to nurture a trusting relationship with China." Cao visited troops on Friday and will pay a visit to the historic capital of Kyoto on Saturday, before leaving on Sund
