<TITLE> APEC security fence rises across Sydney </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SYDNEY, Sept 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Construction of a concrete and wire security fence which will cut the centre of Sydney in half began on Saturday as part of the nation's biggest security operation for next week's Asia-Pacific leaders' summit. The 5-km (3-mile) fence will isolate the leaders, who include US President George W Bush and Russian President Vladimir Putin, in the Sydney Opera House and surrounding hotels. Thousands of protesters, demonstrating against the Iraq war and global warming, plan to rally in Sydney during the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) meetings. Police say they expect the protests to be violent and have warned demonstrators not to march near the APEC summit venue. "We expect there will be violence," New South Wales (NSW) state police commissioner Andrew Scipione told reporters at a recent APEC security briefing. "If someone has a plan to come to Sydney, to come to the APEC event, and they have violence in mind ... they can expect to be looking at the inside of a cell," Scipione said. "My advise is don't come down there because there is a lot of police and we are just waiting for you," he said. While Australian security officials say they have received no intelligence of a terrorist threat to APEC, they have launched the country's biggest ever security operation. Australia's counter-terrorism alert remains unchanged at medium, which means a terrorist attack could occur. Australia, a staunch US ally, has never suffered a major peace-time attack on home soil, although 92 Australians were among more than 220 people killed in bombings on the Indonesian island of Bali in 2002 and 2005. The Australian government has spent A$169 million in the past six years preparing APEC security. A total of 21 leaders are to attend the APEC leaders' meeting on September 8-9, along with spouses, and 5,000 APEC delegates. Many Sydneysiders have criticised APEC security, claiming it will turn Sydney's inner city into a fortress, with people asked for IDs and bag searches. A total of 3,500 police and 1,500 defence force will be patrolling Sydney. A 45-nautical-mile restricted air space will be enforced by fighter aircraft and police helicopters. A navy mine sweeper will patrol Sydney Harbour, along with navy divers, water police and special forces. The city's underground railway network will be closed during the APEC weekend and motorists have been warned to stay out of the city as many roads will be closed. The 2.8-metre (9-ft) high security fence, dubbed by critics as Sydney's "Great Wall of APEC", will cut off the northern part of the central business district. "The construction of the fence will begin around Circular Quay and this will have a knock-on effect throughout the northern part of the city," NSW deputy premier John Watkins said on Saturday. President Bush has apologised to Sydneysiders for any inconvenience his visit and APEC will cause. "I'm looking forward to the beautiful city and to the extent I inconvenience (Sydneysiders), I apologise," Bush told Australia's Sky News television in an interview broadcast on Friday
