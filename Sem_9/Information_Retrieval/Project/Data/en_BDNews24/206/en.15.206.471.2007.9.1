<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com)  The National Board of Revenue has ordered banks to freeze the accounts of former prime minister Khaleda Zia, her younger son Arafat Rahman Coco and nine other relatives, its chief said Friday. "We have issued a letter to banks to this end," NBR chairman Badiur Rahman told bdnews24.com. The banks are yet to get the order since they are closed until Saturday because of three days of public holidays. The latest order also asked chiefs of all banks to block the accounts on individual or joint current or savings accounts, term deposits, loan accounts, foreign currency accounts, credit card, vault, locker and various types of savings instruments. The banks are to provide the Central Intelligence Cell of the NBR with transaction records as well in 10 days. An NBR meeting Wednesday afternoon presided over by the chairman made the decision. Addressing the BNP chairperson in four probable namesBegum Khaleda Zia, Mrs Khaleda Zia, Khaleda Zia and Mrs Khaleda Rahman the NBR issued the letter with the address of Khaleda's Shaheed Mainul Road home in Dhaka Cantonment. It also asked banks to freeze accounts of Coco's wife Syeda Sharmila Rahman, their daughters Zafira Rahman and Zahiya Rahman. The names also include Khaleda's relatives Rashida Begum, Rupa Shikdar, Md Abul Khaer, Faridun Fatema, Saiful Islam and Md Mozaffar Hossain. The move came in line with the ongoing drive against corruption and tax-dodge initiated after the emergency government took the reins in early January. The tax authority on August 1 directed banks to freeze the accounts of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, her husband Dr M Wazed Miah, sister Sheikh Rehana and her husband Dr Shafiq Siddique, Hasina's son Sajib Wazed Joy and daughter Saima Wazed Putul. The NBR blocked the accounts of Hasina after the Anticorruption Commission asked Hasina and her arch political rival Khaleda to send accounts of their assets. Awami League chief Hasina was arrested from her home in mid-June. The latest move raises the number of individuals who have had their bank accounts frozen to some 400. bdnews
