<TITLE> US army officers took bribe from contractors in Iraq: NYT </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 31  (bdnews24.com)  The US Army officers have been found accepting hundreds of thousands and even millions of dollars in bribes from the contractors having won various deals in exchange, the New York Times reported Friday quoting the US government's court documents. One of the officers, Major Gloria D. Davis, a contracting official in Kuwait, shot and killed herself in Baghdad in December 2006. Officials say the suicide occurred a day after she admitted to an Army investigator that she had accepted at least $225,000 in bribes from the company. The US government has begun proceedings to seize Major Davis's assets, a move her heirs are contesting. Another is an Army officer, identified in the investigator's report as "Person B," because he is now cooperating with the investigation. He has confessed of receiving $50,000 in cash bribes from a contractor, the court papers said. Two people with direct knowledge of the investigation or the contracting office in Iraq at the time said "Person B" was Lt. Col. Kevin A. Davis, who worked with an officer who has emerged as a focus of the investigation in the weapons case in Iraq. That officer, Lt. Col. Levonda Joey Selph, was at the heart of the effort to strengthen the fledgling Iraqi security forces in 2004 and 2005. She worked closely with General David H. Petraeus, who commanded the effort at the time. The general is now the top commander in Iraq. There is no indication that investigators have uncovered any wrongdoing by General Petraeus. In a brief phone conversation with NYT Thursday, Colonel Selph confirmed the connection between her and Colonel Davis in Iraq. "I worked for Kevin Davis," Colonel Selph said. She said she wanted to consult her lawyer before speaking further and did not respond to subsequent messages. A woman identifying herself as Kevin Davis's wife said on the phone that he was out of town and not available for comment. She said that he had gone to work for Lee Dynamics after retiring from the army. It is not believed he is related to Gloria Davis. As the case expands, investigators are looking at the possibility that it has connections to what had appeared to be a separate major corruption scandal. Last week, Major John Cockerham, a former Army contracting officer in Kuwait, and his wife and his sister were indicted on charges that they accepted up to $9.6 million in bribes for defence contracts in Iraq and Kuwait. Court documents, say Major Davis also served as a contracting officer at Camp Arifjan, Kuwait, from in 2003 and 2004 and awarded millions of dollars in contracts to a company named American Logistics and its affiliate entities, raising the question of whether the cases are related. A high-level team of the US army is now reviewing 18,000 contracts valued at more than $3 billion that the Kuwait office has awarded over four years. The Army has suspended 22 companies and individuals, at least temporarily, from pursuing government work because of contract fraud investigations in Iraq, Kuwait and Afghanistan, an Army spokesman told NYT Thursday. A total of 18 companies and individuals are barred for a definite period from government work. Seven more face debarment. bd
