 WARSAW, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Poland's ruling conservatives are likely to fare better in a snap election than most opinion polls predict thanks to strong economic growth and their increasingly populist message, analysts and pollsters say. Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski's Law and Justice party faces a strong challenge from pro-business Civic Platform in the election expected to take place on Oct. 21. Surveys show Civic Platform leading Law and Justice by 3-11 percentage points because many voters have turned away from Kaczynski after two turbulent years in power, marked by squabbles with his coalition and European Union partners. But with a quarter of the electorate undecided, Law and Justice may yet capitalise on Poland's booming economy and the party's strong anti-corruption message. "One of the biggest parties in Poland are the undecided voters," said political analyst Marek Migalski from Silesia University in Katowice. "This is the group everyone is trying to woo and Law and Justice's campaign engine is very efficient at doing that." Kaczynski has launched an aggressive media campaign even though parliament has yet to vote on whether to dissolve itself and call a snap election. He has promised wage rises in the public sector and has accused Civic Platform of catering to the rich oligarchs and corrupt "criminals". Pollsters say support for the conservatives may also be underestimated in surveys because their supporters are reluctant to admit they would vote for a party under fire from most elements of the media and intellectual elite. "There is a quite large number of people who lie about their political preferences," said Piotr Ciacek, a sociologist from the SMG KRC pollster. "They do not want to say that they will actually vote for Law and Justice because they are ashamed." Kaczynski and his twin brother Lech, the Polish president, have been criticised in the media for running an "Orwellian state" in which their anti-corruption crusade has led to an abuse of power. The conservatives have also been hit by accusations from a former interior minister, who was detained by state prosecutors this week, that Kaczynski used the secret services to spy on rival politicians in order to discredit them. Surveys show many young, urban voters who did not vote in the 2005 election are angered by the brothers' social conservatism and euroscepticism. They may decide the election if they turn out this time. "Young people are a big chance for the Civic Platform," said Migalski. "They would never vote for Law and Justice." In the 2005 election, 41 percent of eligible Poles cast their votes, allowing Law and Justice to capture power with just over 3.2 million votes in a nation with a population of 38 million. The Platform came second, with just 400,000 fewer vot
