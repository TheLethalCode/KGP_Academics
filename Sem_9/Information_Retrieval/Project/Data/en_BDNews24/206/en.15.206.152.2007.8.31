 MADRID, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news from the Primera Liga before this weekend's matches: Thierry Henry still has a fight on his hands to gain a place in the Barcelona starting line-up for Sunday's match against Athletic Bilbao despite Samuel Eto'o's thigh injury. The Frenchman faces stiff competition from the club's 18-year-old Mexican prodigy Giovani dos Santos who gave a virtuoso performance in Wednesday's 5-0 destruction of Inter Milan in the Gamper Trophy. Real Madrid new signing Arjen Robben will miss out on this weekend's match at in-form Villarreal as he continues to follow an individual training programme following his 36-million euro move from Chelsea. Spanish media report that the 23-year-old may not be ready to play until mid September because of the after effects of knee surgery earlier this year. Valencia will be without leading striker David Villa and Spain winger Joaquin when they travel to Almeria on Sunday. Both players were sent off in last week's 3-0 defeat at home to Villarreal. Real centre-back Pepe will be out for up to three weeks after suffering a thigh strain in training. The Brazilian-born defender received his first call up to the Portuguese squad on Thursday but had to pull out hours later because of the injury. Argentine striker Gonzalo Higuain is back fit after missing the opening game against Atletico Madrid because of a muscle strain. There will be minute's silence before all this weekend's league matches in memory of Sevilla player Antonio Puerta who died on Tuesday, three days after collapsing during a league match against Getafe. After losing 3-0 at home to Almeria in their opening match at the Riazor, Deportivo Coruna take on another promoted side Valladolid on Sunday. Valladolid notched-up a 1-0 win at Espanyol last weekend in their first match since returning to the Primera Liga. The continued dispute over TV rights means that it remains unclear which of this weekend's league matches will be shown on free-to-air television and which will be available on pay-per-view
