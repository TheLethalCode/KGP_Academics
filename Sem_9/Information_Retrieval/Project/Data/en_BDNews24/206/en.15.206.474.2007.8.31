 BERLIN, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany coach Joachim Loew was able to recall strikers Miroslav Klose, Lukas Podolski and Mario Gomez among a group of returning players for the Euro 2008 qualifier against Wales on Sept 8. The forwards were joined in the squad by midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger and left-back Marcell Jansen, who also missed the recent friendly victory over England because of injury. "It's important that the injury situation has eased somewhat before this big qualifier," Loew told reporters on Friday. The situation is still not perfect for Loew, however, with captain Michael Ballack among a group of players still missing through injury. The others include midfielders Torsten Frings and Tim Borowski and forward an Schlaudraff. Bernd Schneider, another senior midfielder, is suspended. Germany lead European Championship qualifying Group D with 19 points from seven matches. Czech Republic are second with 14 points, while Wales are down in fifth with seven points from six games. Germany follow up the Wales game with a friendly against Romania on Sept. 12 in Cologne.
