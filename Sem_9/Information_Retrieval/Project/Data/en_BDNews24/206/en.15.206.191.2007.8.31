 BUDAPEST, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hungary's Socialist government and the opposition clashed on Friday over who was to blame for the rise of the far-right at a press conference which had been billed as a joint event to condemn a paramilitary group. Hungary's warring politicians have been even more deeply divided than usual since a far-right party at the weekend set up a uniformed "guard" which its critics say sports insignia mimicking the Nazi era.

Asked to denounce the Hungarian Guard, Navracsics said only that all parties agreed that it was "bad".
