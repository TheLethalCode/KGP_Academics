 NEW YORK, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US stocks rose on Friday amid optimism a White House proposed mortgage assistance package could ease liquidity conditions, while government bonds eased marginally as they lost some of their safe-haven appeal. President George W. Bush proposed measures to help home owners with subprime mortgages, but warned that the government's job was not to bail out speculators. Bush's comments were in concert with remarks earlier by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke that it was not the central bank's responsibility to protect lenders and investors who made mistakes. Opposition to a bailout by the authorities pushed the dollar weaker against the yen and caused equities to hand back some of their earlier hefty gains. "You could read between the lines that the Fed may ease in September, but I view that any kind of ease would be moderate as the Fed is still suggesting that market solutions are going to be primary," said Subodh Kumar, chief investment strategist at Subodh Kumar & Associates in Toronto. In stocks, benchmark indexes were up. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 169.73 points, or 1.28 percent, at 13,408.46. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up 20.53 points, or 1.41 percent, at 1,478.17. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 30.96 points, or 1.21 percent, at 2,596.26. Economic data showing benign underlying inflationary pressures was overshadowed by Bush and Bernanke's comments. Treasury debt prices traded lower, but were off early troughs, as investors latched on to Bernanke's remarks that the central bank would act as needed to protect the economy. That raised optimism the Fed would reduce its overnight lending rate next month. "The focus of the bond market is the president's proposal," said Andrew Brenner, market analyst at MF Global in New York. "The flight-to-quality is easing." Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were trading 4/32 lower in price for a yield of 4.53 percent from 4.51 percent late on Thursday. The yen continued a recent trend of closely tracking moves in the US stock market and climbed as equities cut their gains on the day. The dollar was down 0.25 percent to 115.65 yen after earlier touching session lows around 115.50 yen. Against the yen, the euro fell 0.3 percent to 157.65 yen. The euro was unchanged on the day at $1.3633. In Europe, shares ended higher on Bush's proposed plans. The benchmark index, made up of top European shares, ended unofficially 1.12 percent higher at 1,532.34 points. Japanese stocks finished up 2.6 percent. Concern about a tropical wave pushed US crude oil futures higher. On the New York Mercantile Exchange October crude was up 54 cents or 0.74 percent at $73.88 per barrel. Firmer stocks and a strike at a Papua New Guinea mine pushed US gold futures sharply higher. The most-active gold for December delivery on the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange jumped $7.50, or 1.1 percent, to $681.40 an ounce.
