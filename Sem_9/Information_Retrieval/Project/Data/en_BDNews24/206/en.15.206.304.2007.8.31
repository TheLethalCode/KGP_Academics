<TEXT>
 GAZA, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hamas appeared to reinforce its armed presence on the streets of Gaza City on Friday ahead of a planned prayer rally by the rival Fatah faction and following a similar gathering last week that ended in violence. Armed Hamas men could be seen in larger than usual numbers on the streets, on rooftops and at windows. However, the Islamist movement, which seized control of the Palestinian enclave in June, rejected a complaint from Fatah that dozens of the secular group's members had been arrested overnight. Supporters of Fatah, led by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, last Friday confronted Hamas forces in Gaza City after weekly prayers. Hamas members fired in the air and detained protesters and some journalists for several hours. Hamas seized control of the Gaza Strip in June following battles with forces loyal to the Western-backed Abbas, who retains power in the larger West Bank. A Fatah official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Hamas forces arrested dozens of members of the group late on Thursday. But Islam Shahwan, spokesman for Hamas's Executive Force security organisation, denied this and accused Fatah of trying to provoke unrest. "These arrests are unacceptable. They aim to undermine the prayers," the Fatah official said. "Hamas is intimidating people and prevent them from the freedom of praying to God." Shahwan said leaders of his force held a meeting with some Fatah leaders overnight and agreed that they would disperse in an orderly way following the public prayers. "We hold Fatah leaders responsible for any act of violence," he said. "We have agreed that there will be no provocations and that people will pray and leave in peace". Fatah says hundreds of its supporters have been detained in Gaza since the Hamas takeover but most have been freed. Hamas says over 400 of its followers have been held in the West Bank. Many Fatah militants have fled Gaza, mainly to the West Bank. Hamas has said any arrests of anyone affiliated with Fatah were strictly non-politic
