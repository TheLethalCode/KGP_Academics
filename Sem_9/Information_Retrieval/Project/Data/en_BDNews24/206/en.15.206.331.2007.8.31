 CAIRO, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A jailed Egyptian Islamist who is third in command of the Muslim Brotherhood suffers from "serious health conditions" and urgently needs medical treatment, the human rights group Amnesty International said on Friday. Khairat el-Shatir is standing trial in a military court along with 39 other members of the Brotherhood -- Egypt's strongest opposition force -- on charges including terrorism and money laundering.

Many analysts see the Brotherhood trial as an escalation of a government crackdown on the non-violent Islamist group, which won a fifth of the seats in parliament in 2005.

Local and international rights groups, including Amnesty, have criticised the military proceedings as unfair, and Egypt has barred independent observers from attending the trial. The Brotherhood seeks an Islamic state through democratic elections and operates openly despite having been banned since 1954.
