 Dhaka, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com)  BNP and its fringe organisations observe the party's 29th founding anniversary Saturday on a limited scale amid a ban on political activities. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia and secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan in separate messages have urged party leaders and workers to observe the day with proper dignity. The day's programmes include hoisting the party flag at BNP's Naya Paltan central office at dawn and laying wreaths at the grave of party founder and late president Ziaur Rahman. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia and the party's secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan will be among those who will pay tribute at Zia's graveside at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar. In a press release signed by BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan, the conditions for observing the anniversary as given by the government are that 20 persons queuing at a time will be able to lay their floral tributes at the grave. The carrying of banners, festoons or placards, the chanting of slogans or visiting the grave in procession is not permitted. BNP sought permission from Dhaka Metropolitan Police on August 25 to observe a two-day programme to mark the anniversary and to lay wreaths, hold open discussions and distribute relief. However a meeting of the advisory council committee on law and order Wednesday decided to allow only the laying of floral tributes at Zia's grave. Law adviser Mainul Hosein told reporters after the meeting: "The decision has been taken to allow laying flowers at the grave of the late president on BNP's founding anniversary. But carrying banners is not allowed. And no permission has been given for holding discussions." BNP has asked local party leaders throughout the country to confer with their local administrations on how to observe the founding anniversary. Ziaur Rahman founded the Bangladesh Nationalist Party on September 1, 1978. bdnews24.
