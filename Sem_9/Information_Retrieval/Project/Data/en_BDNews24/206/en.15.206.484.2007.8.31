 Dhaka, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com)  BNP's student wing president Azizul Bari Helal Friday was remanded afresh in custody in a second case involving recent campus violence that later spread to streets. Interrogators will now question Helal, the president of the Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, for four more days after his previous remand expired Friday. Chief metropolitan magistrate Md Hasan Sarwar approved the latest remand after the investigator of the case appealed for seven days. Earlier Saturday, a court allowed the interrogators to take Helal into four-day remand in a case filed with Shahbagh Police Station for the violence in the University of Dhaka. But the magistrate approved the fresh remand in a case filed with Ramna Police Station. Ramna police sub-inspector Golam Mahfiz Friday sought court's permission to take Helal into 10-day remand in the case involving violence in Malibagh area. According to the case details, Helal had allegedly backed a street procession of about 200 to 300 students from Malibagh Habibullah Bahar University College to Siddeshwari University College. In so doing, he breached the emergency powers rules and created panic among citizens, the case papers said. Helal's counsel Mohammad Ali opposed the remand appeal and claimed his innocence. Ali said Helal had no role in the violence since he had long been suffering from Hepatitis-B and was bed-ridden at his home during the incident. He said Helal had been sick since September last year. A team of the Detective Branch of police arrested Helal at his Maghbazar home on August 24. bdnews24.co
