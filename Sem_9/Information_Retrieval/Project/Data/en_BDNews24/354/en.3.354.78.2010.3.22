 Dhaka, March 21 (bdnews24.com)The government approved bids on Sunday of two companies for four power plants of a combined capacity of 270 megawatts, slated to be built by June next year. The cabinet purchase committee, at a meeting Sunday, gave the green light to a bid by consortium Energypac Power Generation and Engineering Ltd, Bangladesh's largest power engineering company, for a 100 megawatt power plant in Gopalganj district. The project will cost around Tk 6.93 billion, Nurul Karim, joint secretary of the cabinet division, told reporters after the meeting. The same consortium also won contracts for two 50 megawatt power plants at Katakhali in Rajshahi and Shantahar in Naogaon, costing Tk 3.50 billion and Tk 3.64 billion respectively. Hyundai Heavy Industries of Korea has won the contract to install a 70 megawatt power plant in Bera of Pabna district, Karim said. He said the contracts stipulated installation of the four furnace oil-fired power plants within 15 months. The cabinet committee's approval is a part of the government's initiative to build ten diesel or furnace oil-fired 'peaking' power plants with a total capacity of 830 megawatt by the end of 2011. The Power Development Board floated the tenders last September, without prior approval from the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council. ECNEC approved the Tk 72.03 billion project for the 10 plants just last week. The plants are meant for generating electricity only during the peak hours of 4-11pm, and will be run on gas-alternatives due to a shortage of natural gas. Total power production falls short by about 1200 megawatt during peak demand in Bangladesh, causing frequent power black outs and grey outs. The country's 40 or so operational power plants generated 3945 megawatts against a peak demand of 5200 megawatts on Sunday. bd
