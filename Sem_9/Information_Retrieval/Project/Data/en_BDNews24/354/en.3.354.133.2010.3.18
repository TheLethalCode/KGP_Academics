 bdnews24.com New Delhi Correspondent New Delhi, March 18 (bdnews24.com)  Water resources minister Ramesh Chandra Sen said that Dhaka had high expectation from the India-Bangladesh Joint River Commission meet that began in New Delhi on Thursday. Though India is believed to be insisting on settling "certain technical issues" before striking a deal with Bangladesh for sharing of water of Teesta, Sen expressed hope that the JRC ministerial meet would further strengthen the friendly relation between the two countries. "The expectation is high. We had a very good discussion today. We will meet again tomorrow," Sen said after meeting his Indian counterpart Pawan Kumar Bansal. "We are here to strengthen the friendly bond between the two countries further," he added. Bansal said that the two sides had a frank discussion on the issues related to sharing of water of Teesta and other common rivers. "It is the first JRC ministerial meet after a long gap of almost five years and the discussions we had today helped both sides understand the positions of each other better," he added. The Indian Water Resources Minister said that he would be in a position to comment on the outcome of the meet after further discussion with Sen on Friday. Ahead of the meeting between Sen and Bansal; the Water Resources Secretary Sheikh Mohammad Wahid uz Zaman met his Indian counterpart U N Panjiyar and did the spadework for the ministerial. Bansal and Panjiyar are believed to have made it clear that India would like to ensure a fair share of water of Teesta for its West Bengal state for irrigation and hydropower generation. The Minister of Irrigation and Waterways of West Bengal Subhas Naskar was present in the JRC ministerial meet. He articulated West Bengal Government's views on the issue of sharing water of Teesta. Officials of the Indian Government's Ministry of Water Resources pointed out that New Delhi would lay maximum emphasis on the opinion of the West Bengal Government before striking a deal with Dhaka. According to Indian Constitution, water is a state subject and the Central Government must take into account the view-point of the State Government before entering into a bilateral arrangement. Bangladesh is believed to have insisted on an interim understanding for sharing of water of Teesta and conveyed to India that it expects a larger share of water of the river than what it gets now. Sen reached New Delhi on Wednesday along with a 16-member delegation for the meet, which is one of the follow-up moves by Bangladesh and India after the two countries recently reaffirmed their resolve to settle the pending bilateral issues through dialogue. Despite speculations, Dhaka and New Delhi could not finalize an agreement on sharing of water of Teesta before Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to India in January this year. However, the India-Bangladesh Joint Statement issued during Hasina's visit to New Delhi did stress on early conclusions of the discussion on issues related to sharing of water of Teesta. "Recognizing the sufferings of the people of both sides in the face of scarcity of lean season flows of the Teesta River, the Prime Ministers (Hasina and her Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh) expressed that the discussions on the sharing of the Teesta waters between India and Bangladesh should be concluded expeditiously," stated the Joint Statement The two Prime Ministers had directed their respective Water Resources Ministers to convene the Ministerial-level meeting of the Joint Rivers Commission in the first quarter of 2010. It was also decided that the JRC would also discuss issues relating to other common rivers like Feni, Manu, Muhuri, Khowai, Gumti, Dharla and Dudhkumar. Sen and Bansal may have a formal interaction with media at the end of the talks.
