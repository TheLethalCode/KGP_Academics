<TITLE> Poor skills, low education hurt migrant workers </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 21 (bdnews24.com)Bangladeshi migrant workers, who are the country's major source of hard currency earning, often face trouble at workplaces abroad because of their poor skills and little education, according to a new study. "Due to these limitations, they accept jobs that pay very little," Philip L Martin, professor at University of California, said at a presentation of his research on migration status in Bangladesh in the capital on Sunday. Around 45 percent of the workers going abroad have "no schooling", Martin said at the presentation organised by the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS). Most of the workers have very little information about the place where they go, and after getting there they face difficulties communicating because of language problem, he said. "But they've the options to choose workplaces. They've the power to say 'no', when they are offered low wages," he added. Martin said Bangaldesh has a labour force of around 55 million, which is increasing by 1.8 million a year. Of them, 80 percent are doing informal jobs, while the remaining 20 percent12 millionare involved in formal sector. The government employs about one-third of the 12 million. Around 5.6 million Bangladeshis are now working abroad. Of them, 90 percent are in the eight countries of the Middle East. The migrant workers have remitted some $7.32 billion during July 2009 to February this year, becoming a major contributor to the economy, the study found. To enhance their wage, Martin suggested, the migrants need to be sent to the high-wage payers' destinations. But, it requires proper skill training for the workers. At the same time, the government should provide necessary data on the migrant-receiving countries' status of employment scopes and wages. With these measures, more people from Bangladesh could get jobs abroad, which will ultimately increase the remittance flow, Martin, who is a professor of Comparative Immigration and Integration Programme of the university, added. INEFFICIENT AND COSTLY RECRUITMENT PROCESS Martin was surprised to observe that the recruiters, who process around 39 percent of the workers' employment, do not bother to know about the workplaces' condition before sending the workers there. "Most of them do not visit the foreign employers and migrants to check on the job situation." The recruiters generally rely on agents and sub-agents to fill the jobs, he added. Martin, in his research, also observed that the recruitment process in Bangladesh was costlier and time-consuming compared to other migrant-sending countries. He said recruiters charge an average of Tk 1,60,000 to send workers to the Middle-East, while if one goes on his own, needs only around Tk 84,000. However, most of the workers are forced to pay the extra amount simply because they are unable to follow the procedure, Martin added. SKILLS AND WAGES He also portrayed a scenario for the recruitment of 'inappropriate workers' by the recruiting agencies, saying that "a highly skilled worker can afford to reject a low-wage job, but the one with less skill pays a higher amount to get that job. "As a result, the dissatisfied employer cuts wages and the less-skilled worker protests, causing conflict," Martin said. Offering a solution to the problem, he said internationally accredited training institutions could resolve the problem, but "It'll take another 20-30 years to adopt such training." LOANS FOR RECRUITMENT PROCESSING Martin also stressed on initiating a pre-departure loan programme by the micro-financing institutions to help out individuals going abroad. "They've to face a lot of troubles to arrange the amount needed. In most cases, they're forced to borrow from family members." To protect the micro-financing institutions, the authorities should ensure that the remittance is sent though banks. "The process will also ensure protection of the migrants' jobs if the banks and NGOs review the job contract," Martin added. NEW SCOPES OVER THE RECENT RECESSION Citing the impact of the 2008-09 recession, the most severe in 50 years, Martin said that many countries were forced to halt recruitment of new migrants. "But relatively few migrants lost jobs or departed because of the recession," Martin observed. As the economic situation in many migrant-receiving countries appears to be improving, they are expected to import more workers over the next decade. "Many traditional immigration countries have expanded side-door entries (non-immigrants) for guest workers, students and visitors," he said. He suggested that the migrant-sending countries should gather relevant information on wages, migrant status and gender of the migrant-receiving countries to provide to the job-seekers. Meanwhile, Martin also warned about the increasing number of rural-urban migration caused by the shrinking labour force in the agriculture sector.
