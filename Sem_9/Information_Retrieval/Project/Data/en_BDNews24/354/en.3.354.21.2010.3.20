 Prodip Kumar Chowdhury Dhaka, Mar 19 (bdnews24.com)  Abdul Malek from Bhola remembers every detail of his last visions before losing his eyes. Malek pleaded with his attackershe refuses to name any namesand begged them for mercy, to no avail. "They gouged my eyes out with their nails." The brutal attack occurred because he voted for Awami League in the 2001 general elections, Malek said. His house was also torched. Malek recounted his story to bdnews24.com, as he came to file a complaint to the commission formed to probe atrocities on supportrtes of the then opposition Awami League as well as minorities immediately following the 2001 elections. But he is among the few who have reported to the commission, said its head Muhammad Shahabuddin. Despite numerous incidents at the time of murder, rape, attack, loot, plunder and arson, the victims are not coming forward, Shahabuddin said in an interview with bdnews24.com earlier this week. He said although the commission had received about 1000 complaints, it believed that the number of such instances was far higher. The High Court last year ordered the government to form a probe body to look into the atrocities committed following the 2001 elections, on a petition by a human rights organisation. The incumbent Awami League government formed a three-member probe committee in December 2009 with retired district judge Muhammad Sahabuddin as its chief. The committee was asked to submit a report along with necessary recommendations within four months. A public notice was issued on Feb 2 asking people to send evidence of atrocities to the commission's office on Circuit House Road within 20 working days. The time was subsequently extended by another 15 days. Officials said over 1000 allegations had reached the commission up to Mar 15. Sahabuddin said that "thousands of murders, rapes, attacks, arson and lootings occurred after the 2001 polls". "But the victims are not coming to us." Asked why, Shahabuddin said he could not say for sure. "Perhaps because it's been so long, eight years have already elapsed." But, he added, although the deadline was over, the commission was still open to receiving complaints considering the gravity of the incidents. "Victims can still register their allegations with the commission after the deadline has expired," he said Asked if the commission could realistically deal with more than 1,000 cases in 35 working days, the commission chief said, "It is nearly impossible to probe all the allegations within such a short deadline, but we are trying to complete them." "The commission is sorting out the allegations and is likely to complete them within the month," he said. "We will be visiting scenes of the crimes in early April." The first spot visit, Shahabuddin said, would be Bhola since it was reported to have witnessed the highest number of post-election crimes. Evidence of atrocities along with necessary recommendations will be submitted by the commission to the government for further measures. bdne
