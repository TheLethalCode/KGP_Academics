 Dhaka, Mar 21 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh made the most of the second day's play in the second Test against England reducing the visitors to 171 for three at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Sunday. After posting their third highest score  419 all out, which was also only the seventh occasion they had gone past the 400-run mark in the longer-version, the home side's spinners set to work. At the close, makeshift opener Jonathan Trott was unbeaten on 64 while Ian Bell remained not out on 25. Skipper Shakib Al Hasan, Abdur Razzak and Rubel Hossain each shared a wicket apiece. England lost the wickets of Alastair Cook was caught by Imrul Kayes off Razzak at midwicket for 21, Kevin Pietersen (45) and Paul Collingwood lbw for a duck in the post-tea session. Pietersen (45) was undone by a short quick delivery from Shakib which he spooned to Imrul Kayes at short cover. Rubel had Collingwood lbw for a duck in the next over with a hint of reverse swing to leave England stuttering at 107 for three. Reuters adds: Earlier, tail-enders Naeem Islam and Shafiul Islam scored maiden half-centuries to frustrate the tourists as the hosts battled to their highest ever test total against England. Bangladesh resumed the second day on 330-8 and batted for more than 24 overs in the morning session to add 89 runs. The tally is Bangladesh's third highest against any side, behind the 488 scored against Zimbabwe at Chittagong in 2005 and 427 against Australia at Fatullah in 2006. Off-spinner Graeme Swann claimed the last wicket shortly before the lunch break when he trapped Rubel Hossain lbw for 17 to finish with 4-114 in the innings. Naeem added 26 runs to his overnight total to remain unbeaten on 59 after facing 172 balls and hitting eight fours. Shafiul led Bangladesh's charge in the morning, racing to his first Test fifty off 47 balls with a boundary through the cover off the bowling of James Tredwell. Paceman Tim Bresnan gave England their much-needed breakthrough when he dismissed Shafiul for 53 with wicketkeeper Matt Prior taking the catch to end a ninth-wicket stand of 74. England lead the two-match series 1-0 after completing a 181-run win in Chittagong on Tue
