 Dhaka, Mar 21 (bdnews24.com)Opposition BNP has formally backed Hafizuddin Ahmed to run for the April 24 election in the vacated Bhola-3 constituency. The decision was made at a standing committee meeting, chaired by party chief Khaleda Zia, on Sunday. "The party's parliamentary board has nominated vice president Major Hafiz," committee member Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury told bdnews24.com. The election commission announced the election schedule earlier this week. Hafiz was defeated by Jasim Uddin of Awami League by 13,000 votes in the general election on Dec 29 2008. The Election Commission declared the Bhola-3 parliamentary constituency vacant on Feb 3 following a Supreme Court ruling, which decalred Jasim's candidacy in the general election illegal as he violated the retirement rule. bdn
