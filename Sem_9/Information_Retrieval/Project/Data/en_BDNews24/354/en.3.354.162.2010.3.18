<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 18 (bdnews24.com)Tripartite talks involving the government, the launch owners and workers were taking place Thursday evening to try and bring an end to the strike that was just concluding its third day. The meeting, which started at 8pm, was taking place at the residence of labour minister Mosharraf Hossain. The shipping minister Shahjahan Khan was also present. The talks took place without any "preconditions" as the workers federation had earlier pressed for. Passenger launches across Bangladesh have been at a standstill from March 16 as workers called an indefinite strike following the collapse of talks on Monday to resolve their long-standing demands for better pay and working conditions. Earlier Thursday, a meeting involving the launch owners, the Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority and the the directorate of labour did not result in any breakthrough. After the meeting, chairman of BIWTA Mahbubuddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com that the workers must withdraw their strike before talks could start. "We told the director of labour that we're ready to talk if he seeks withdrawal of the strike first," he said. However, the joint secretary of the Water Vessels Workers Federation, Deen Mohammad, told bdnews24.com that the proposal was illogical and the talks could not be held with such a precondition. "They must talk in the current situation," he said. "Both the owners' association and the government are not executing the agreements, which were signed earlier. The last agreement, signed in November, has not been implemented," he claimed. He said that if the owners want to talk to us, they should it whilst the strike was going on. bdnew
