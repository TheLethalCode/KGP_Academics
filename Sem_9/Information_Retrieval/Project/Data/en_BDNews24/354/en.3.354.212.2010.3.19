 (CORRECTION - Read 178 MW in headline and intro) Dhaka, March 19 (bdnews24.com)  Seven small power plants, set up with the $50 million World Bank assistance, are adding 178 megawatts of electricity to the national grid. The plants have gone into production within three years after the project was launched under the Investment Promotion and Financial Facility programme, said WB country director Alan Goldstein during a visit to one of the plants at Elenga in Tangail. The five-year project implementation started in February 2006 and is scheduled to end in December 2011. "The bank is assisting private and government initiatives to set up small power plants, which are speeding up power generation," said Zubair KM Siddiqi, WB's financial expert on South Asia. "It is hard to get loans of large amounts from the private sector in Bangladesh. The banks are not keen on lending money for 10 to 12 years", he said, adding "which is why WB funded the IPFF project". Four of the power plants, out of seven, are run by Doreen Power Generations, a private company. Of them, three 22MW plants are in Tangail, Narsingdi and Feni, while another 11MW plant is in Feni. Malancha Holding Power Generations controls two power plants  one 35MW at Dhaka Export Processing Zone and one 44MW at Chittagong EPZ. Another 22MW capacity plant is in Chittagong and is being operated by Regent Power Ltd. All of the plants are run by natural gas. The Elenga plant generates 22 megawatts electricity, which are added to the national grid under the Power Development Board, said Shahidul Islam, senior consultant engineer of the plant. Another 55 megawatts of electricity are added to the national grid from three other power plants under Doreen, he said. It takes approximately 9.5 cubic feets of natural gas an hour to generate one kilowatt power at the Elenga plant, said Islam. bdne
