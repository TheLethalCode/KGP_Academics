 Dhaka, Mar 18 (bdnews24.com)  In the face of mounting pressure, water transport owners on Thursday agreed to meet with the workers as the indefinite strike entered its third day. The owners' authorities, however, set a precondition for the meeting, urging the workers to withdraw the ongoing strike before the meeting, which was rejected by the workers federation. The federation's joint secretary Deen Mohammad told bdnews24.com that the owners and the government had signed deals with the workers several times in the past, but never implemented them. They didn't even carry out the agreement signed on Nov 9 last year, he said. "Therefore, this proposal (withdrawal of strike) is totally illogical," Mohammad said. He urged the owners to sit in a meeting with the workers amid the strike. A team of the water vessel owners on Thursday, led by Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Association chairman Mahbuhuddin Ahmed, met with Abu Taleb, the director of the labour directorate. "The workers would have to withdraw their strike at first. We also told this to the head of the labour directorate," Mahbubuddin told bdnews24.com. Passenger launches across Bangladesh were at a standstill from Mar 16 as 150,000 water transport workers called an indefinite strike following the collapse of talks to resolve their long-standing demands for better pay and working conditions. bdnews2
