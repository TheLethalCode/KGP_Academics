 bdnews24.com New Delhi correspondent New Delhi, March 19 (bdnews24.com)  India is contemplating a unilateral 'no-firing' policy along its border with Bangladesh for one year in order to protect innocent civilian lives. The proposal comes against a backdrop of recent border shootings by India's Border Security Force in which Bangladeshis have been killed or injured. Indian home secretary GK Pillai, at a joint security conference in the Indian capital on Friday, said that New Delhi was considering the proposal of "unilateral no firing on the border for a year". The modalities of the move were being worked out, he added. Pillai said that India's move was intended to address Bangladesh's concern over deaths of civilians due to firing along the border between the two countries. He added that India was well aware of the fact that death of innocent citizens in cross-fire was a very sensitive issue in the neighbouring country. The Indian home secretary was delivering the inaugural lecture at the India-Bangladesh Security Conference jointly organised by the Observer Research Foundation and the Bangladesh Enterprise Institute in New Delhi. Pillai did not clarify if the declaration of no-firing would mean a blanket order to India's Border Security Force personnel against opening fire along the border with Bangladesh. The home secretary also suggested expediting the bilateral process in order to resolve border disputes between the two countries by the end of this year or early next year. 'DIPLOMATIC MEASURES' Bangladesh's home minister Sahara Khatun told parliament just days before that the government was addressing the killing of innocent Bangladeshis by India's Border Security Force. Replying to a question, she had said "diplomatic initiatives" were on to reach a permanent solution. She mentioned that 14 Bangladeshis had been killed by BSF firing in 2010 so far. "The government has been trying its utmost to resolve the problem. We want a permanent solution," the minister said. Sahara also said prime minister Sheikh Hasina during her Delhi trip in January discussed border shootings and deaths by BSF with her Indian counterpart, seeking a halt to loss of civilian lives. Director general-level talks also just concluded between the two border forces in New Delhi on March 11 with both sides vowing greater cooperation and "restraint", in accordance with the spirit of the India-Bangladesh joint statement that was issued during Hasina's visit to New Delhi. JAINTAPUR DISPUTE New Delhi's latest move towards declaring a no-firing policy along the India-Bangladesh border comes after Dhaka lodged protest through diplomatic channels against alleged incursions by the Indian Border Security Force into Bangladeshi territory at Jaintapur in Sylhet. The dispute over a piece of land in adverse possession led to the troubles and the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) chief Maj. Gen. Md Mainul Islam also strongly raised the issue during the recent meet with his BSF counterpart Raman Srivastava in New Delhi. Pillai, however, defended the BSF on Friday and denied reports that the Indian guards had transgressed into Bangladesh during the recent troubles at Jaintapur-Muktapur stretch of the India-Bangladesh border. He said some Indian fishermen had been fired upon by the BDR personnel and BSF retaliated. Bangladesh maintains that BSF guards have repeatedly breached the border and escorted the Indian fishermen to fish in Bangladesh territory in recent months. Pillai also pointed out that India and Bangladesh shared a 4096 km long border and the total length of the disputed stretches was just 6.1 km. He deplored tardy progress in efforts to resolve the border dispute over the past few years and stressed the need to expedite the process. 'CUSP OF CHANGE' He said that India and Bangladesh were at the cusp of a change in bilateral relation and both the countries should take advantage. "We need to move very fast. I don't think this window of opportunity will last forever," he added. The home secretary termed Hasina's visit to India as a milestone in India-Bangladesh ties, but cautioned that the gains would remain on paper unless translated into realities as quickly as possible. "The next nine months are going to be critical. If we miss the bus in nine months, we may find ourselves climbing a mountain," he added. 'COOPERATION' Pillai said that New Delhi was considering removing Bangladesh from the list of countries of which the citizens need an approval from the ministry of home affairs of the Indian government to get an Indian Conference Visa. He expressed satisfaction on recent cooperation between Bangladesh and India in the fight against terrorism. He also stressed on the need to check cattle smuggling from India to Bangladesh. The Bangladesh Enterprise Iinstitute, led by former foreign secretary Farooq Sobhan, joined the ORF to organise the two-day India-Bangladesh Security Dialogue. The conference, the second in the series, is discussing various security aspects affecting both the countries like radicalization, militancy and terrorism in Bangladesh, radicalization and terrorism in India: role of Lashker-e-Toiba, terror financing in South East Asia, combating terrorism: regional cooperation in South Asia, the North East factor in India-Bangladesh relations. bdn
