 Dhaka, Mar 15 (bdnews24.com)Opposition chief whip Zainul Abdin Farroque faces arrest in a defamation suit filed in Shariatpur for his recent allegations against the prime minister's son. Two pro-government activists filed separate defamation suits on Monday against Farroque. One was filed by Shariatpur's Bangladesh Chhatra League chief Alamgir Hossain Howlader and another by a Chittagong Juba League member Shahed Uddin. The slander charges were pressed in the district courts for Farroque's statements on Friday regarding prime minister's son Sajeeb Ahmed Wazed's alleged association with internet telephony. The senior BNP leader during a press briefing at his Gulshan home in the capital on Mar 12 had claimed that Sajeeb controlled the illegal VoIP trade from Canada and the USA. The business started during the last Awami League government's 1996-2001 tenure. "But when we raised this issue in parliament, our mikes were switched off," Abdin had said. He also alleged that the rogue internet telephony business had begun with the help of a relative of the prime minister through Spectra Solutions. "The government is counting Tk 150 billion in lost revenue every year due to this illegal business. The entire amount is being laundered abroad," claimed Farroque. The Shariatpur BCL president Howlader said in his suit at the district's Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court that such allegations tarnished the image of the prime minister's son and the party as they were broadcast by TV channels that day and carried by the dailies the next day. Howlader also filed for damages against Farroque of Tk 100 crore for the defamation. His lawyer Mir Sahab Uddin, said, "Judicial magistrate Utpal Bhattacharya accepted the suit and issued an arrest warrant against the accused." Chittagong's central Juba League member Shahed Uddin said that the accusations against Sajeeb were baseless and imaginary. The plaintiff's lawyer Iftekhar Simul Chowdhury told bdnews24.com that the metropolitan magistrate recorded the complaint and ordered Farroque to appear at court on May 16. bd
