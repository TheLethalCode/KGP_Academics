 Dhaka, Mar 21 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court has set April 5 for framing charges against ruling Awami League's former general secretary Abdul Jalil in a tax evasion case. Metropolitan senior special judge ANM Bashirullah on Sunday also sent the documents of the case to Dhaka's Special Judge's Court-1. The charges were supposed to be framed against the AL leader on Sunday, but the judge said that charge framing was not possible without the presence of the accused who had left the court feeling unwell. The court has already deferred the date twice  once on Jan 18 and the other time on Feb 10. The AL leader has secured High Court bail in the case, but Additional public prosecutor Shah Alam Talukdar told bdnews24.com that the defendant's bail would end on Monday. The National Board of Revenue deputy commissioner Bazlur Rahman Khan filed the case on Oct 15 last year accusing Jalil of not paying income tax worth Tk 4 lakh by concealing income of about Tk 54 lakh. The court, on the same day, issued an arrest warrant against Jalil, who secured bail three days later. The charges against Jalil include concealing bank revenue information, the amount of money in his and his wife's accounts, and credit card information as well as for not having income tax documents.
