 Dhaka, Mar 21 (bdnews24.com)Bangladeshi Aminul Islam, who was lured away from a job in Dubai by an international kidnapping ring and held hostage for ransom in Pakistan, revealed the story of his abduction on Sunday after his release and return home. Aminul said at least 50 other Bangladeshis were being held by the same gang in Pakistan. Detective Branch of police recently arrested six suspected members of the gang in Bangladesh, who reportedly collected the ransom from the families of the kidnap victims. "This is a highly organised crime circle that cheats innocent workers abroad and collects money," deputy commissioner DB police, Md Mainul Islam, told reporters on Sunday. Aminul, from Tanor in Rajshahi, told the reporters at the DB office, that he was held at a house between Quetta and the Iran border. He said his family paid a total of Tk 379,000 through two accounts of Pubali Bank and Islami Bank and via S Alam Paribahan, a parcel and courier service, to buy his freedom. Aminul, who was working as a carpenter in Dubai, said a man named 'Babul' approached him there and offered him a job in Europe at higher wages, to which he agreed. They travelled from Dubai to Iran, where Aminul was "arrested" by two men who identified themselves as police. Babul and another man named Kabir "freed" Aminul. However, Kabir claimed that he bought Aminul from the Iranian police. Two others of the groupidentified as 'Rob' and 'Sabuj'joined them from Turkey. Aminul said they took him to Pakistan and held him for six months at a house, where he saw 53 more Bangladeshis in the same plight. Additional deputy commissioner of DB police, Mollah Nazrul Islam, said Aminul's family informed police when the kidnappers did not release him even after they paid the ransom money. On Mar 9, police arrested 'Kamal', 25, a member of the crime gang, by tracing the Pubali Bank account. In subsequent days, they arrested Rob's mother Mariam Begum, 50, and Younus Miah, 28, Lipu Mollah, 22, Md Shaheen, 27, and Abdul Mannan, 40, for links to the kidnapping. Police said they recovered Tk 295,000 during the arrests, which they suspect was ransom money. They said Aminul was freed following the arrests and returned to Bangladesh on a Pakistan International Airlines flight Saturday afternoon. Assistant commissioner of DB police Md Marufat Hussian said some of the kidnappers are from Shibchar in Madaripur districts. He said members of the circle are active in Italy, Oman, Pakistan and Dubai. Deputy commissioner of DB police, Mainul Islam said notices will be served to the Interpol to arrest the members of the gang who are staying abroad. bdnews2
