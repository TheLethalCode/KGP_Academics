<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 21 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Sunday issued a rule asking telecom authorities to explain why suspending the operations of RanksTel should not be declared illegal. The High Court bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and ATM Fazle Kabir issued the rule upon a writ petition lodged by the private land phone company chairman A Rauf Chowdhury. The court ordered Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) and the telecommunication secretary to respond to the rule within seven days. The petitioner told the court that BTRC had shutdown RanksTel's operations without first serving a notice as required by law. The lawyers for the petitioners also said that mobile phone operators Grameen Phone and Aktel were only ordered to pay a fine for the same offence The lawyers argued that the telecom regulator had acted arbitrarily. RanksTel, a private land phone operator, was the third company to be raided by BTRC on suspicion of illegal VoIP operations in a week. The telecoms regulator in two previous raids, on Mar 14 and 16, said it found evidence of illegal call operations against Dhaka Phone and WorldTel. Five top executives of Dhaka Phone were sent to jail after being arrested on charges of running unlicensed VoIP operations. bdne
