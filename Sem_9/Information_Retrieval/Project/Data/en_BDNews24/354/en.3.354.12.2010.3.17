 bdnews24.com New Delhi correspondent New Delhi, March 17 (bdnews24.com)  India is likely to factor in the opinion of the state of West Bengal while negotiating a deal with Bangladesh for sharing water of the Teesta river. A 16-strong Bangladesh delegation, headed by water resources minister Ramesh Chandra Sen, reached New Delhi on Wednesday to attend the 37th ministerial-level meeting of the Joint River Commission. According Bangladesh and India officials, the talks starting Thursday will primarily discuss the volumes of water the two countries would receive from the Teesta river. Sen and his Indian counterpart Pawan Kumar Bansal will jointly chair the meeting. Subhash Naskar, irrigation and waterways minister of the state government of West Bengal, will also be present. "Given the excellent friendly relation between India and Bangladesh, I hope that the JRC ministerial meeting will make significant progress in reaching an agreement on the issue," Naskar said after flying from Kolkata to New Delhi on Wednesday. He said that the West Bengal government had conveyed to India's central government that a large number of people in the North Bengal region of the state were dependent on the Teesta, a major source of water required for irrigation and hydropower generation. Naskar added that the state government expected the central government to "adequately take care of the interests of the people of West Bengal" while striking a deal with Bangladesh for sharing water of Teesta. Dhaka and Delhi have been discussing the Teesta sharing issue since 1972. The discussion is still going on. The Teesta is considered crucial for Bangladesh's food security. Water Development Board sources say, over 750,000 hectares of farmland in the food surplus Rangpur region is dependent on the river for supplementary irrigation. "We hope that the two countries at the meeting will reach an agreement on the Teesta's sharing," Shaikh Md Wahid-uz-Zaman, Bangladesh's water resources secretary, told bdnews24.com. Wahid-uz-Zaman and his Indian counterpart U N Panjiar will also be present in the talks starting Thursday. SURMA DREDGING In addition to the Teesta, Bangladesh will bring up dredging of the Surma river. WDB officials say water flows in the Surma river comes down to almost nothing in the dry season after 1990s as a big shoal has emerged in the no-man's land at Amalshid where India's Barak river feeds two rivers in Bangladesh the Surma and Kushiara. They say removal of the shoal by dredging has not received the importance it deserved. "We will discuss the Teesta's water sharing. Also, we will raise this issue of Surma's dredging at the JRC meeting," Wahid-uz-Zaaman, one of the delegation members, told bdnews24.com. WDB's superintendent engineer (in Sylhet) Syed Afsan Ali told bdnews24.com on Monday that if the shoal was removed, more water in the Surma will be available. "It should be dredged," he said. The board officials said they could not go for the dredging as the shoal is in the no-man's land. "It is up to the JRC to settle this," a top official of the board told bdnews24.com. "Without the JRC's approval, we cannot go for dredging at the border," he said. LONG-DUE MINISTERIAL MEET The first JRC ministerial meeting in five years is being held against the backdrop of the recently concluded "successful summit" between prime ministers Sheikh Hasina and Manmohan Singh in New Delhi in January. The four-day talks scheduled for March 17-20 is expected to focus mainly on the sharing of Teesta water, a prime concern for Bangladesh. However, they will also discuss issues relating to other common rivers like Feni, Manu, Muhuri, Khowai, Gumti, Dharla and Dudhkumar. Officials said both countries were hopeful of making significant progress in resolving the issues related to sharing of Teesta water. Although the issue was expected to be settled before the January summit, Dhaka and New Delhi failed to do so because of disagreement between the two countries' respective positions. However, the India-Bangladesh Joint Statement issued during Hasina's visit to New Delhi did stress on early conclusions of the issues related to sharing of Teesta. According to the JRC's charter, the two countries should sit every year to talk water-related issues and settle all disputes on the 54 common rivers that enter Bangladesh from India.
