<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 18 (bdnews24.com)Bidisha Siddique sued her ex-husband HM Ershad on Thursday for Tk 60 crore in damages alleging that she was tortured by him and had suffered harm to her reputation from "false cases" filed by him. The former wife of the former president identified herself only as Bidisha, no surname, in the case statement filed with the Dhaka District and Sessions Court. Bidisha claimed in the case that Ershad tortured her both physically and mentally during 2005 to 2007, including harassing her with different false cases that harmed her social, political and business reputation. She also claimed damages for police torture that she alleges she suffered in custody after she was detained in connection with the cases filed against her by Ershad. Judge Imrul Quayes accepted the case and ordered former president and Jatiya Party chairman Ershad to appear before the court on April 20. Bidisha has demanded from Ershard Tk 10 crore for physical and mental harm, Tk 22 crore for loss in her profession and business and Tk 28 crore for defamation. The case papers say that in June 2005, five years after they married, Ershad filed a false fraud case against her. She claims that, under Ershad's influence, on June 4 police then arrested her and took her for interrogation the following day. The case papers say that whilst in police custody she was given electric shocks, her nails were uprooted and she was beaten while being hung from the ceiling fan. Subsequently, she was released from all the cases. Bidisha also states that she was well-known as a business woman, and through her design work in the garments sector, she had become "an institution". She says however that the propaganda spread by Ershad harmed her business and personal reputation and that Ershad also took over her boutique house 'Isabel' in Banani. Advocate Ranjit Barman is acting for the plaintiff. bdnew
