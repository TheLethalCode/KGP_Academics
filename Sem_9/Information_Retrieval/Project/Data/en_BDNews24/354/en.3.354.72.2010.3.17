 Dhaka, Mar 17 (bdnews24.com)The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court on Wednesday sent to jail 58 pro-government student activists who had arrested from Dhaka College following overnight clashes between rival factions. Police released 13 of the 71 cadres belonging to Bangladesh Chhatra League, the student wing of the ruling Awami League, after teachers pleaded with the police for them. Officer in charge of the New Market Police Station Quamrul Islam told bdnews24.com that 13 students were identified by the teachers as innocent. The arrestees were charged with vandalism and conspiracy. Abdul Baset Galib, one of the 57 detainees, was, however, charged under the Arms Act as he was allegedly found in possession of 52 rounds of ammunition. A number of machetes and clubs were also recovered during the raid, said Islam. Activists of two camps of Dakkhinayan Hall and North Hall fought over control of berths. Witnesses on campus said 20-25 rounds of gunfire were heard and at least 10 injured students were taken to hospital. The clash between the two factions began around 11:15pm over the attempt to secure control of Dakkhinayan Hall, witnesses said. bdn
