<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 17 (bdnews24.com)Home minister Sahara Khatun said the government will soon be publishing a new list of names of people considered to be the country's "crime bosses". The home minister revealed this on Wednesday at a prize giving ceremony at a school in Uttara. At Monday's parliamentary session, Sahara had made public the names of 42 men considered by the government to be the country's most wanted men. However, the list was heavily criticised as it was found to include the names of people who have died. The list also failed to include the names of men widely considered to be the most notorious offenders. Dhaka Metropolitan Police Commissioner A.K.M Shahidul Haque, on Tuesday, told bdnews24.com that he was not even aware of the list the home minister had revealed in parliament. On Wednesday, the Sahara Khatun said that a new list would be made. "The top criminals will be rooted out. The godfathers with be brought under the law and their names will be exposed to the public." Haque said that the DMP continually revises its list of criminals - and that its own list would have to be compared with that of the minister's. bdne
