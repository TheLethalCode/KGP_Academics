<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 17 (bdnews24.com)The government will establish a park in Gazipur to protect and breed extinct species at a cost of Tk 65 crore. It will be called the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Safari Park. Topon Dey, a forest conservator of the forestry department, told bdnews24.com that there were 63 species of flora and 220 species of fauna in the Shal-Forest. "The ecology of the forest is under threat from the pressure of industrialisation, population growth, land grabbing, building of illegal structure and dumping of waste," he added. The park will be established on 4 thousand acres of land in Sripur Upazila. There are plans to protect and breed extinct species like the 'Nilgai' and wild-buffalo in the park. Assuming ECNEC approves the project, the Department of Forestry hope to implement the project by June 2012. bd
