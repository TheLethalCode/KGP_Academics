<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 19 (bdnews24.com)  BNP's likely candidate Hafiz Uddin Ahmed has demanded army deployment during Bhola-3 by-election scheduled for Apr 24. "I will request the EC to deploy army to ensure high-level of security," said Hafiz. "I met party chairperson Khaleda Zia on Thursday night after the EC declared election schedule," Hafiz said. "We've decided nothing should go unchallenged," he added. The deadline for submission of nominations is Mar 29 and for withdrawals is Apr 8. The EC declared the Bhola-3 constituency void on Feb 3 as ruling Awami League MP Mohammad Jashimuddin, a retired army officer, was found to have violated electoral law. Hafiz, who was elected six times from that constituency, lost the seat in the last election. "We hope that the EC will hold a free, fair and neutral election," said Hafiz. He also claimed that the ruling party members are torturing and filing false cases against the BNP activists to drive them out of the area
