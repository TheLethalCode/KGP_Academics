<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 17 (bdnews24.com)  The Cargo Vessel Owners Association urged launch workers to end their strike and sit for discussions to stem economic losses amounting to crores of taka. The association's leader, Gazi Belayet Hossain Mithu, made this plea at a rushed press conference in the National Press Club on Wednesday.. He said, "Already the halt in work has caused a fall in internal water cargo trade, so please withdraw the strike and sit for discussions." Hossain also said that the strike is illegal as the labour ministry had declared the Water Transport Workers Federation void two months ago. The workers went on strike from Monday after putting forward a 22-point demand including the formulation of a minimum wage, a proper salary structure, issue of appointment letters and river security The Cargo Vessels Owners Association does not at present have elected representatives as elections for its management body are still in preparation. Hossain, the outgoing general secretary, spoke at the press conference on behalf of the organisation. Hossain said he agreed with Tuesday's comments made by shipping minister Shahjahan Khan. "The workers are getting paid according to the gazette notice of 2004. The interim allowance worth 69 percent of their fee is also being paid. So the strike demanding a change in the salary structure is in no way logical." He went onto say that, "Due to the strike, the smaller cargo vessels are incurring losses of approximately Tk 3 crores a day, and importers are incurring additional costs of $ 0.7 million." Hossain said. "Foreign vessels with cargo will in the future be unwilling to bring goods into the country" he claimed Other leaders of the association including Khurshid Alam and Rashed Hassan were also present at the press conference..
