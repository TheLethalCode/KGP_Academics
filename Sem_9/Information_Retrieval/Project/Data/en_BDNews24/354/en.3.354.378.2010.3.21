 Dhaka, Mar 21 (bdnews24.com) -- A High Court petition on Sunday sought an order for dismantling of all illegal hoardings in the capital, after two people were killed in Gulshan earlier this month when a billboard was torn loose from a rooftop during a storm. The petitioner Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh also sought an explanation from the Shahbagh Police for its "non-cooperation" during last week's attempted drive by Dhaka City Corporation to begin removing illegal hoardings in parts of the city. The city authority launched the drive, starting in Shahbagh, on the night of Mar 18. But the planned "overnight drive" came to a halt at around 11.30 pm, after just two hours, as two teams of Shahbagh Police, who had been providing protection, left the scene, Khalil Ahmed, executive magistrate of the DCC, had told bdnews24.com. Two police officials gave two separate reasons at the time for the withdrawal of the police teams. Krishnapad Roy, deputy police commissioner of Ramna zone, had told bdnews24.com that the DCC attempted to demolish a police box during the drive, to which the police objected. The issue could not be resolved and so the police left the scene, Roy had said on the night. Shahbagh police chief Rezaul Karim, however, said that they had to withdraw the police forces for the regular duty at Dhaka University campus. According to DCC, there are only around 500 legally erected hoardings in the whole of Dhaka. The rest, an estimated 2,500 billboards and mega signs, are illegally erectedthough DCC admits even they don't know the exact numbermany of which are in a hazardous condition. Sunday's petition was filed with the bench of justices AHM Shamsuddin Chowdhury and Md Delwar Hossain. bdn
