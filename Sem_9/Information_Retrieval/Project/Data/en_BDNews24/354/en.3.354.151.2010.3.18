<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 18 (bdnews24.com)FBCCI president, Annisul Huq called on different business associations in Bangladesh to commit more to corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities. Bangladesh's apex trade body handed out equipment to assist its member chambers to set up offices. The Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI) under its "Capacity Building Programme for Associations under the FBBCI" gave away office equipment to 167 business associations. Huq said that the initiative was possible due to a government grant of Tk 2 million for development of the business community. Urging more CSR activities, he cited FBCCI's recent gifts of computers, water-pumps and sewing machines to 787 families. Huq, whose term expires on March 23, also urged the different chambers of commerce and industry at district levels to open free-Friday clinics at their premises. "It doesn't take much time or cost much. You only have to take the initiative." He admitted that a job creation scheme of the FBCCI had hit some snags, but the federation was committed to finishing the job, he said. "There have been some pitfalls, but we have learnt from that experience." Beximco Group's deputy chairman Salman F Rahman, who attended the event as the chief guest, asked business associations to think and work for their members. "If you properly serve them, only then will the members make your association a success - and then you will find that resources will no longer be a problem." The former FBCCI president stressed the importance of unity among the business community if it wanted to prosper. Reforms to FBCCI are also necessary to strengthen the trade body's capacity, Rahman said. Rahman himself, as president of Bangladesh Association of Pharmaceuticals Industry, also received a computer, printer and photocopier from the FBCCI. bd
