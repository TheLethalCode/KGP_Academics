<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 17 (bdnews24.com)Shipping minister Shahjahan Khan says the religious affairs ministry has turned down his ministry's initiative to transport Hajj pilgrims by sea. But Khan is still optimistic about the proposal which aims to reintroduce pilgrimage by sea after 25 long years. Khan told bdnews24.com on Tuesday that his ministry was looking forward to reviving the old mode of travelling to Saudi Arabia by ships. But the religious affairs ministry pointed to a number of problems, he said. "The state minister for religious affairs himself told me about the problems of travelling by ship." Khan said that after closure of the maritime route in 1984, the government also shut down a number of services required for pilgrims travelling by sea. He was told that it would not be possible for the government to the make all necessary arrangements for the sea-route by mid-October when pilgrims may be expected to start their travel. "So it might not be possible to work something out although the prime minister was keen to revive the sea route," said the shipping minister. He said prime minister Sheikh Hasina had also asked that decisions be taken after consulting with the Saudi authorities through the foreign ministry. An official of the ministry involved with the Hajj arrangements said that the shipping ministry made an announcement on Feb 7 without consulting other government agencies and ministries. He said that the new initiative would require a large number of people and resources that cannot be pooled in such a short notice. The shipping ministry, after a meeting on Feb 7, announced that the cost of pilgrimage could be halved and undue harassment substantially reduced if pilgrims travelled by sea. The shipping ministry estimates that it would take about a week to reach Jeddah from Chittagong by sea and the meeting had decided to transport about 18,000 pilgrims this year.
