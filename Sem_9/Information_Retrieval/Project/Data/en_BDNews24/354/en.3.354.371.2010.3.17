 Dhaka, Mar 17 (bdnews24.com)A BTRC drive has unearthed evidence of illegal VoIP operations by private land phone operator WorldTel Bangladesh, officials said on Wednesday. The discovery came two days after the telecoms regulator found similar evidence against another telephone company Dhaka Phone at its Mohakhali office. The telecoms regulator on Tuesday night launched a drive in WorldTel Bangladesh's switch room in the capital's Modhyo Badda area. Senior BTRC consultant Zian Shah Kabir said they found proof of the illegal Voice over Internet Protocol operations at a switch room of the telephone company's network operations centre. Two multiplexers, used for making VoIP calls, were seized during the drive, he said. No official was available at that time, Kabir said and added the switch room was locked down after the drive, he said. Rapid Action Battalion assisted Bangladesh Telecommunications Regulatory Commission officials during the drive. Five Dhaka Phone officials were sent to jail after being arrested on Sunday night on charges of illegal VoIP operations. b
