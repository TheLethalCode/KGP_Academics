 Dhaka, Mar 21 (bdnews24.com)  A criminal case has been filed in a Dhaka court against five senior members of the Jamaat-e-Islami, including the party's chief Matiur Rahman Nizami, accusing them of hurting religious sentiments. Bangladesh Tariqat Federation secretary general Syed Rezaul Haque Chandpuri filed the case in Dhaka Magistrates Court on Sunday. The case cited Dhaka City Jamaat amir Rafiqul Islam Khan's comparison of Nizami to Prophet Hazrat Muhammad (PBUH) at a Mar 17 meeting of pro-Jamaat student front Islami Chhatra Shibir in the city. Various newspapers on Mar 18 reported Khan saying that the prophet in his lifetime was "tortured, falsified and conspired against" and "the same is happening in the case of Nizami". Others accused in the case are Jamaat secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed, executive committee member Delwar Hossain Saidee and the chief of Jamaat's Dhaka Metropolitan (South) unit ASM Yahia. Chandpuri, referring to Khan's statement as published in various newspapers, said, "He was audacious enough to compare the prophet with Nizami. Religious followers of the prophet were hurt by this comparison." The Tariqat leader also said in his complaint that, "Jamaat leaders have killed many innocent people during the liberation war. Now they are conspiring against religion after getting scope of being involved in politics. They are mis-interpreters of Islam." Two government ministers on Saturday had publicly declaimed the leaders of opposition party Jamaat as "war criminals". As the government prepares for war crimes trials, state minister for law Quamrul Islam proposed the takeover of all money making entities linked with Jamaat, whose top leaders have been accused of 1971 war crimes. State minister for home affairs Samsul Haque Tuku warned that "the top war criminal suspects", indirectly referring to Jamaat leaders, would be the first to be tried. Tuku said war crime trials would start "this month". He also said Jamaat leaders, including Nizami, Mojaheed and Saidee, were "branded as the top war criminals". bdne
