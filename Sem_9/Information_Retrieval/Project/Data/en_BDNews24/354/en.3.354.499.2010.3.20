 Satkhira, Mar 20 (bdnews24.com)The special court in Satkhira, where the trial of some of the border guards accused of siding with the mutiny at the BDR's headquarters in Dhaka last year is taking place, will resume on Sunday after being adjourned for two months. The special court, based at the 41 Rifles Battalion headquarters at Taltoli, is hearing the cases involving 60 men of the 7 Rifles Battalion based in Neeldumur. The trial will begin at 10am with the BDR director general Maj Gen Mainul Islam, as head of the court panel, said Lt Col Iqbal Azim, commander of 41 Rifles Battalion. The other members of the panel include Lt Col Gazi Khalid Hossain and Maj Lutful Karim. Lt Col Badrul Alam is the prosecutor of the case. Charges were framed on January 18 against the 60 men for offences under the BDR Act involving breach of discipline, vandalism and looting. On the following day, 16 of the accused confessed to being involved in the rebellion and sought the mercy of the court. After recording the testimony of 15 people, the court adjourned on January 21. The court on Sunday intends to record testimony of the remaining 25 witnesses. The bloody February 25-26 mutiny saw over 70 people brutally killed, nearly 60 of them army officers deputed to the border force. Rebellion also spread to other BDR outposts around the country. On November 15, the government formed six special courts, including two in Dhaka, to try about 3,500 border guards accused in 40 cases around the country. In the event of a guilty finding, the maximum penalty for rebellion under the BDR Act is seven years in jail. The six special courts are trying charges of mutiny, looting and arson. Allegations of murder will be tried separately in civilian courts. bdne
