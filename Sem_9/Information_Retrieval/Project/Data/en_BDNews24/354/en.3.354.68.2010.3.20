 bdnews24.com New Delhi correspondent New Delhi, March 20 (bdnews24.com)  Water Resources Minister Ramesh Chandra Sen has proposed that Bangladesh, India and Nepal could jointly build reservoirs on rivers in Nepal to augment flows of water in the Ganges system for the benefit of all the three countries. Bangladesh, which has long maintained that it has received less than its share of Ganges water since it signed a treaty with India in 1996, mooted the trilateral initiative during the two-day Bangladesh-India Joint River Commission meet in New Delhi. According to a press-release issued by the Bangladesh High Commission in Delhi, India was agreeable to the proposal of a tripartite discussion. The JRC ministerial meet, which was held after a gap of five years, concluded late at night on Friday. During the talks, Sen and his Indian counterpart Pawan Kumar Bansal reviewed the implementation of the India-Bangladesh Ganges Water Sharing Treaty, which the two countries had inked in 1996. Sen and other members of the delegation from Dhaka submitted that Bangladesh had received lesser quantity of water at Farakka than its share mentioned in the indicative schedule of the 1996 Treaty for different 10-day periods between 1997 and March 10 this year. "Bangladesh also requested India to take all necessary steps so that it receives due share as per indicative schedule in future," the press-release stated. It also stated that the Bangladesh side referred to Article-VIII of the Ganges Waters Treaty for long term augmentation of the flows of the Ganges during the dry season at Farakka. It was in this context that Sen proposed jointly building reservoirs in Nepal. Bangladesh proposed that a reservoir on Saptakosi River in Nepal could be taken up at the first instance. FLOOD DATA The Bangladesh side also expressed that it was grateful to India for transmitting flood related data from a number of stations in India and asserted that the flow of data helped Bangladesh provide flood forecasts. To minimise loss of lives and properties during flood, Bangladesh requested India to transmit more flood related data from further upstream stations on a continuous basis during the entire monsoon period. Indian side agreed to provide flood data of 'Sahibganj Site' on Ganges situated 78 km upstream of Farakka barrage on a continuous basis  enabling Bangladesh to enhance the advance warning and forecast time by 16 hours further.
