<TEXT>
 DUESSELDORF, Germany, Mar 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Minutes after successfully defending his WBO, IBO and IBF heavyweight titles, Vladimir Klitschko had already set his sights on Briton David Haye's WBA crown. The 33-year-old Ukrainian retained his three titles when he knocked out American "Fast Eddie" Chambers with a left hook in the 12th and final round on Saturday evening.

Vladimir is the more likely to fight the big-talking Briton with Vitaly set to fight European champion Albert Sosnowski from Poland in May. Vitaly though also sounded confident a Klitschko-Haye fight was on the cards, even as early as this year. "Maybe even this year," he told reporters in Duesseldorf. "We have good chances of setting this fight
