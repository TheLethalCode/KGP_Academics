 Dhaka, Mar 18 (bdnews24.com)At least 20 were injured in two different clashes among pro-government Bangladesh Chhatra League in Mymensingh and Rajshahi campuses. In Mymensingh, Chhatra League activists of Bangladesh Agricultural University and Ward 21 of the town engaged into clashes on Wednesday night over the birthday observance of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The clashes took place near KR Market on the campus and left 15, including the assistant proctor, hurt. Two cases were filed with the Kotwali Police Station in this connection on Thursday night, one of which was filed by chief security officer Mohiuddin Hawlader and another by resident of Ward 21 Md Jasim Uddin. Hawlader said the case was filed for the attack on teachers and students, holding a programme without permission and for vandalising shops. The authority in its case accused around 25 BCL activists of Ward 21, while the other case accused 10-12 BCL activists of the campus unit. Kotwali police chief Golam Sarwar told bdnews24.com despite the two cases, no one was arrested. Acting vice chancellor Ali Akbar said a three-strong probe committee was formed to look into the violence, but did not disclose the members' names. In protest against the clashes, BCL, Bangladesh Students' Union, Chhatra Front and the Teachers' Association brought out processions on Thursday. A number of exams were postponed and the bus service to the town was suspended to avoid unwanted incidents. Additional police were deployed in the campus, while proctor Md Shamsuddin said they requested police and the RAB to be strict on the miscreants. In Rajshahi University, at least five BCL activists were injured in a clash between two factions of the organisation over an attack on an Islami Chhatra Shibir activist on Thursday. Witnesses said that at around 1.30pm the BCL factions, loyal to the university unit's president and general secretary, locked in the clash at Tukitaki Chattwar. The secretary-backed activists said that some workers of the president's group were beating up a Chhatra Shibir activist Jabed, which secretary Mazedul Islam Apu tried to mitigate. But workers of the president's group attacked the secretary's men, they claimed. The president's men, however, accused their opposition of attacking them first. Police recovered three iron rods and a sharp weapon from the campus. RU proctor Chowdhury Mohammad Zakaria said an additional force of police was deployed in the campus to avert any further untoward situation. Matihar thana police chief Tofazzal Hossain Khan said no cases were filed in this regard. bdnews24.
