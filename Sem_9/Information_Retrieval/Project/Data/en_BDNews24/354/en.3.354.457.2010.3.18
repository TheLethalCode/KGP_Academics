<TEXT>
 ROME, Mar 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Wesley Sneijder deserves much of the credit for Inter Milan's surge towards a possible Champions League-Serie A double. The Dutch playmaker showed his class in Tuesday's 1-0 Champions League win at Chelsea which gave his side a 3-1 aggregate triumph and will be out for a repeat performance when Inter visit fourth-placed Palermo on Saturday (1945). His display in London won Sneijder plaudits across the continent and he has been consistently impressive in Serie A this season having adapted to Italian football's demands after being offloaded by Real Madrid in the close season. With Real's expensive new signings struggling to gel, that decision may turn out to have been a mistake, but their loss is Inter's gain.

They will be without suspended midfielder Sulley Muntari for the tricky visit to a Palermo side with serious ambitions of beating Juventus to Italy's fourth and final Champions League qualification slot. Second-placed Milan have big problems in defence for Sunday's home game against Napoli (1400) when victory will put them top if Inter drop points. Centre backs Alessandro Nesta, Daniele Bonera and Oguchi Onyewu are injured while full back Ignazio Abate is doubtful. Milan's England midfielder David Beckham looks set to miss the rest of the season after tearing his Achilles tendon in last week's 1-0 win against Chievo Verona. Third-placed AS Roma are without four suspended players, midfielders Rodrigo Taddei, Daniele De Rossi and David Pizarro and defender Philippe Mexes, for Saturday's home game against Udinese (1945). Fifth-placed Juventus visit Sampdoria, who are also in the running for Champions League qualification in sixth place, in Sunday's late game (1
