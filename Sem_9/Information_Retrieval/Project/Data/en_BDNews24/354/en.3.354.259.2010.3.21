The appeal was handed over to prime minister Sheikh Hasina by Japanese MPs. MPs Naoto Sakaguchi and Mieko Tanaka handed the appeal to the prime minister on Sunday. The appeal was signed by a total of 35,757 citizens of 150 countries and 12 independent territories around the world and accompanied by 2,754 'peace messages'. The appeal highlights the global support to the government's effort to implement the 1997 CHT Peace Accord as a part of its electoral pledges, the MPs sadi in a statement. It also marks out the urgent need for the government to adopt a time-bound action plan, allocate required human and financial resources, and take appropriate legal and administrative measures so that the Land Commission, Refugee/IDP Taskforce and other bodies related with implementing the accord can fulfill their mission without delay. The signature drive was co-sponsored by the CHT Jumma Peoples Network of the Asia Pacific (Australia), the Indigenous Jumma People's Network USA, Jumma Net (Japan), and the Organizing Committee Chittagong Hill Tracts Campaign (Holland) and is endorsed by 55 organisations worldwide.
