<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 19 (bdnews24.com)  The government is set to declare the flourishing boutique industry as a new 'thrust sector'. "We will declare it as a 'thrust sector' to help expansion of the industry which employs a huge number of our women labour force," commerce minister Faruque Khan said on Friday. The boutique industry has an estimated annual turnover of Tk 6000 crore, or 1 percent of Bangladesh's total GDP, Prof AKM Abduj Jaher of the National University said in a paper presented at a seminar in the capital. He said there are at least 5000 boutiques, or small fashion houses, in Bangladesh, with an estimated investment of Tk 250 crore. Faruque Khan told the seminar the Bangladesh Boutique House Owners Association would be declared a national trade body for the sector "by the end of this month". "The government is ready to provide funds for training in the sector and I will make sure that it is done." He also promised that better bank loan facilities will be provided to the entrepreneurs of this sector. At present boutiques are not termed an 'industry' but listed among the SME sectors. As part of a 'thrust sector' they will receive special treatment from the government including bank financing. "We will look into the possibility of providing collateral free, low interest rate loans for the sector," Faruque said. In the past, the apparel and shrimp sectors were given privileges as 'thrust sectors' in Bangladesh, and are now among the biggest industries in the country.
