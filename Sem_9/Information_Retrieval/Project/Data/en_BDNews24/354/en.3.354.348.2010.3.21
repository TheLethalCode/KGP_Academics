 Dhaka, Mar 21 (bdnews24.com)A cyber attack on government websites, operating out of the prime minister's office, has been tracked to an Indian IP address, an official said on Sunday. The Access to Information team (A2i), based at the prime minister's office, told bdnews24.com that the computer responsible for the hacking of 19 district web portals was linked to the Indian ISP provider, VSNL. Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited is a leading internet provider in India. The A2i team said it has identified the specific IP address of the computer and is now writing to VSNL asking it to identify the computer subscriber. The attack on the government's district web portals started at 1.51 am Saturday (March 20), SM Akash, A2i's media manager, told bdnews24.com. bdnews24.com was the first to report the cyber attack after it discovered that 19 out of the 64 district portals had been hacked at around 2.30am. The hacker, identifying himself as "EMIL INDIAN HACKER", threatened "cyber war" in retaliation to any terrorist attack by Pakistan on Indian soil "via Bangladesh". The hacked portals displayed a poster on opening, which said: 28 DIFFERENT STATES, 28 DIFFERENT LANGUAGES BUT ONE WORD JAI HIND!' A message below the poster read: "Secure border between India and Bangladesh. If any terrorist send by Pakistan come via Bangladesh route then I will danger to YOU Cyber War will be started. These is demo We don't want 26/11 in India GOVERNMENT LOOK AT IT ELSE CYBER WAR WILL START. WE ROOTED AND YOUR ISP." Repair work was underway by Saturday afternoon, said officials, who in some cases had first been notified of the cyber attack by bdnews24.com's online report. By 5pm all but one site was restored and by the end of the day all the affected sites were fully operational. In a press statement on Sunday, the A2i team said that the attacks on the district information websites "posed no national risk". The websites had "no sensitive information and its data is backed up every night". The statement goes onto say, however, that "this latest attack highlights the growing need to focus on cyber crimes and building infrastructure to protect us from threats." New legislation in Bangladesh has prescribed a ten year jail term and a financial penalty of upto Tk 1 crore following conviction for an offence of this kind. Although the cyber attack has been traced to an IP address of a computer in India, an A2i team member has admitted to bdnews24.com that the computer owner may not be responsible for the attack. "Hackers are very good at hiding their tracks and real identity," the team member said
