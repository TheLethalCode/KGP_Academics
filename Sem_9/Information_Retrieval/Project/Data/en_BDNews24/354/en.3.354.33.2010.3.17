 LONDON, Mar 17(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The number of Britons claiming jobless benefit fell in February by the biggest amount since 1997, official data showed on Wednesday, surprising markets and giving the Labour government some pre-election cheer. Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed the claimant count fell by 32,300 in February, confounding analysts' forecasts for a rise of 8,000. January's increase, previously reported at 23,500, was slashed to 5,300. The claimant count rate eased to 4.9 percent, the lowest since August 2009.

The number of people without a job on the wider ILO measure fell by 33,000 in the three months to January to 2.449 million. That left the jobless rate at 7.8 percent, just below forecasts for a reading of 7.9 percent. Clouding the picture, however, was a 54,000 drop in the number of people in employment to 28.86 million in the three months to January -- the lowest level since the three months to January 2006. The employment rate for people of working age now stands at its lowest since late 1996. There was also a smaller than expected rise in Britons' pay packets. Weekly average earnings rose by 0.9 percent in the three months to January compared with the previous year, little more than half the 1.7 percent rise predicted by economi
