 Dhaka, Mar 19 (bdnews24.com)  Waterway communications resumed Friday morning throughout the country after a three-day standstill caused by a workers' strike. The water transport workers called off their strike Thursday midnight after a three-way meeting between the government, water transport owners and workers reached an accord over pay. "All the workers were back to work in the morning," Water Transport Workers Federation senior vice-president Shah Alam told bdnews24.com. BIWTA Sadarghat terminal traffic inspector, Mohammad Solaiman, told bdnews24.com that excepting two, other launches had left the terminal. "The MV Wapda and MV Isli could not depart for passengers' shortage," he said. Water transport across Bangladesh came to a standstill for three days as 150,000 members of the workers federation called an indefinite strike, following the collapse of talks on March 16, to press for a proper pay scale that was assured to them in November. The strike stranded thousands of regular river passengers across the country. Transport of goods was also disrupted during the strike causing economic woes. The government, workers and owners eventually agreed to sit together Thursday night at the residence of the labour minister. Shipping minister Shahjahan Khan was also present as an accord was reached around midnight. "There was a three-way agreement between the parties," labour minister Mosharraf Hossain told reporters after a four-hour meeting with water transport workers and owners. A 16-strong committee was also formed, he said, consisting representatives from the three partiessix from the workers, six from the owners and four from the government. Hossain said the committee will start functioning from Sunday. The meeting, which started at 8 pm at the minister's home, decided that the committee, headed by Abu Taleb, head of the labour directorate, will formulate a pay scale for the workers in line with the national one, as agreed last November, by April 30. The workers federation last went on strike for three days from Nov 6-9 last year. They withdrew the strike then too after the government and the water transport owners association assured them of a proper pay scale. Bangladesh, covered by a network of about 250 rivers, is highly dependent on water transport. Navigable water routes stretch about 6,000 km during the monsoon and about 3,800 km in the dry season. Some 72 million passengers travel by inland waterways every year and about 890,000 transport vessels of all sizes carry about 1.2 million tonnes of freight annually on rivers. According to a government study carried out in 1994, 13 percent passengers and 32 percent of goods on inland waters were carried annually by mechanised water transport. bdnews24
