 bdnews24.com Beijing Correspondent Beijing, Mar 18 (bdnews24.com) -- Prime minister Sheikh Hasina, now in Beijing on a four-day visit to China, began formal talks with Chinese premier Wen Jiabao Thursday afternoon. The talks began at around 6pm (local time) at the Great Hall in the Chinese capital, said officials accompanying her. They said the Chinese premier received the Bangladesh leader on her arrival at the Great Hall. The two prime ministers are expected to discuss a number of projects, including the Chittagong-Kunming railway and road links through Myanmar, second Padma Bridge, deep seaport in Chittagong, eighth Bangladesh-China Friendship Bridge, capacity-building in agriculture, telecommunications and solar energy. Hasina will be seeking greater Chinese investment in Bangladesh that might contribute to reducing the trade gap, heavily in favour of China. Three accords and some memoranda of understanding are expected to be signed between the two leaders during the visit. They include Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement, Framework Agreement on Shahjalal Fertiliser Factory and Agreement on 7th Bangladesh-China Friendship Bridge. At the end of the formal talks Hasina will attend a banquet hosted by Wen. Sheikh Hasina arrived at Beijing Wednesday midnight (local time) boarding a Biman Bangladesh plane. Chinese assistant foreign minister for South Asia, Hu Zhengyue, received her at the airport. Hasina is expected to meet with Chinese president Hu Jintao and National People's Congress Chairman Wu Bangguo on Friday. Bilateral, regional and international issues are slated to feature prominently during the discussions with the Chinese leaders. She will address a meeting of Chinese and Bangladeshi business leaders Friday morning. She is also expected to visit Kunming during the visit. This capital of Yunan province will serve as one end of the proposed trans-border road and rail link with China connecting Kunming with Chittagong through Myanmar. Foreign minister Dipu Moni, communications minister Syed Abul Hossain, industries minister Dilip Barua and state minister for Chittagong Hill Tracts Dipankar Talukdar are accompanying the prime minister. Besides a 16-member government delegation, another delegation of eminent citizens, businesspersons and journalists were also included in Hasina's entourage.
