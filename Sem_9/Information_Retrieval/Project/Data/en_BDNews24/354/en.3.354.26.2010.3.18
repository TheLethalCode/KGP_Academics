<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 18 (bdnews24.com)A blazing fire lit up the night as it swept through a Dhaka slum in the early hours of Thursday, razing hundreds of dwellings to the ground in just over half an hour. There were no immediate reports of serious casualties or fatalities, fire service chief Brig Gen Abu Nayeem Md Shahidullah told bdnews24.com at around 1 a.m, soon after the flames were doused, though firefighters were still at work. The blaze broke out at the Bashbaria slum in Mohammadpur around midnight, rescue workers said. It was under control within 40 minutes, but not before it had gutted "almost three quarters of the homes", said one witness at the scene. "You can't imagine the devastation in such a short time," he said, shouting above the din of fire trucks and the crowds of onlookers that had filled the Bashbari Road. Residents and fire officials said the slum comprised around 400 makeshift homes, of which "at least 200-300" were destroyed. Thousands watched the blazing spectacle from the roadside as spectators from neighbouring areas joined the slum dwellers who had evacuated at the first sign of fire. Resident Sufia said she left her home with her two children as soon as she spotted the blaze breaking out at the eastern end of the slum. "There have been no reports of casualties or deaths," Brig Gen Shahidullah, director general of fire service and civil defence, said at the scene. But many of the residents were searching for family members among the crowds. Syed Saraji was still looking for his two grandchildren an hour after the fire broke out. "We got separated in the rush," he said. Shahidullah said the fire broke out at a time when most residents had gone to bed. "Stoves for cooking would most likely have been out." "So we suspect the fire may have originated with a mosquito coil, which caught on something flammable, perhaps a mosquito net, as is often the case," said the fire service chief. "But we can't say anything for sure yet.
