 LONDON, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chelsea have confirmed that captain John Terry was involved in an accident outside Stamford Bridge on Tuesday which resulted in a club security officer suffering a leg injury. The Metropolitan Police said on Wednesday that they were called to an incident after Chelsea's Champions League defeat by Inter Milan and that a 35-year-old man had been taken by ambulance to a west London hospital. "Police were called shortly before 11.15 pm on Tuesday to reports of a collision between a car and a pedestrian," a Met Police spokesman said. "A 35-year-old man suffering a broken leg was taken by ambulance to a west London hospital where he is described as being in a stable condition. "The car, a 4x4, did not stop at the scene. Enquiries into the incident are ongoing. The Metropolitan Police Service did request Surrey Police conduct a breath test on our behalf, which was carried out. We don't discuss the results." Chelsea said Terry had not been aware of the incident at the time but spoke to the police and the member of staff when he was told about it. The club said they understood that the security official had not suffered a broken leg. "We can confirm there was an unfortunate accident as John Terry left Stamford Bridge last night," Chelsea said in a statement. "When driving out of the stadium at approximately 1-2mph in a queue of traffic exiting the ground, his car was surrounded by photographers and fans.

"John was aware at the time that there was a lot of contact with his car during the incident but not that anyone was injured as a result. Upon hearing of the injury, John spoke to the police. He has also been in contact with the staff member to check on his welfare."
