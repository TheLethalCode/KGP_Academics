 Dhaka, March 20 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh government websites, operating out of the Prime Minister's Office, were attacked on Saturday by hackers purporting to be "Indian" . bdnews24.com, at around 2.30am, found that 19 out of 64 district web portals had been hacked by "MIL INDIAN HACKER", threatening "cyber war" in retaliation to any terrorist attack by Pakistan on Indian soil "via Bangladesh". Most of the sites were fixed around 16 hours later, said officials, who in some cases had first been notified of the cyber attack by bdnews24.com's online report. The hacked portals displayed a poster on opening, which said: 28 DIFFERENT STATES, 28 DIFFERENT LANGUAGES BUT ONE WORD JAI HIND!' A message below the poster read: "Secure border between India and Bangladesh. If any terrorist send by Pakistan come via Bangladesh route then I will danger to YOU Cyber War will be started. These is demo We don't want 26/11 in India GOVERNMENT LOOK AT IT ELSE CYBER WAR WILL START. WE ROOTED AND YOUR ISP." Lt Col Ziaul Ahsan, chief of RAB's intelligence division, which is in charge of tracking cyber crime in Bangladesh, told bdnews24.com on Saturday afternoon, at least 12 hours after the attack occurred, that they had "not been notified" of the hacking incident. The prime minister launched the district web portals in January as part of the government's pledge to build a 'Digital Bangladesh'. The sites, maintained from PM's Office under the Access to Information wing, offer data and related links for each of Bangladesh's 64 districts. The government has said it is preparing web portals for the country's 469 upazilas, or subdistricts, in future. But Saturday's incident illustrates the poor state of cyber security in Bangladesh. Dr M Kaykobad, professor of computer science and engineering, BUET told bdnews24.com that the attack was an issue of concern and portrayed the lack of attention by the government. "The government should be extra careful about this type of crime, it is serious," he said. MA Jalil, deputy commissioner of Dinajpur, one of the 19 districts whose portals were hacked, told bdnews24.com that they had noticed "after the news was published online at bdnews24.com". Officials of the Access to Information wing of the PMO told bdnews24.com at around 6.30pm that 18 of the 19 hacked portals were repaired and the last one would be fixed soon. Meanwhile, the hackers may have been referring to a number of recent arrests in Bangladesh of operatives of Pakistan-based militant organisations, which have been blamed for terrorist attacks in India, and have reportedly operated or recruited members from Bangladesh.
