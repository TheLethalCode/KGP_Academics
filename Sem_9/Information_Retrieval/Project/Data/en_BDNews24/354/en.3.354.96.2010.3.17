 Dhaka, Mar 17 (bdnews24.com)The family of a man picked up by Rapid Action Battalion for shooting at them during a robbery have demanded punishment of RAB personnel for torturing the suspect in custody. On Mar 5, RAB-10 sub-inspector, Md Abdul Zabbar Mridha, filed an illegal arms case against Nabeen Hossain Rana. The elite force accused Rana of firing at RAB personnel while committing a robbery. Rana's family were talking to reporters at a media briefing at the Bangladesh Crime Reporters' Association. Rana's father, Ali Hossain, demanded withdrawal of the "false case" against his son. Nihar Akhter Prima, wife of the detainee, said at the briefing that on Mar 3, 14 RAB personnel raided their house at Satish Sarker road and tortured Rana. Later they took Rana away with them. Rana was missing for the next two days. "On Mar 5 we got information that Rana was bullet-hit and in the Gandaria Police Station. He was later taken into remand," Prima said. RAB-10 operation officer Enamul Kabir told bdnews24.com that squadron leader Reza, who led the raid on Mar 3, would be the right person to ask about the issue. Reza, however, could not be reached for comment. bd
