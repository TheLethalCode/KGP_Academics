 Syed Nahas Pasha London, Mar 19 (bdnews24.com)A new phase of a "groundbreaking" project in Bangladesh to fight poverty and combat climate change will start in April, a British minister announced Thursday. The UK's international development secretary Douglas Alexander said Britain will provide a 70m grant over the next six years to help people lift it out of poverty. Speaking at a Bengali community event in East London organised by local MP Jim Fitzpatrick, Alexander said the next phase of the Chars Livelihoods Programme will help more than one million of the poorest Bangladeshis to escape extreme poverty and adapt their homes for the impact of climate change. Alexander also told bdnews24.com this is an additional development fund. This money will be spent on tackling climate change, he said. "Climate change is making the challenge of dealing with poverty even harder for communities across Bangladesh," said the international development secretary. "When I was there in September with the Climate Change Secretary, I came away with an understanding that if we are serious about tackling global poverty, we also have to be serious about tackling climate change." He said the money would help raise the homes of people which are at present threatened by rising flood water. Alexander also spoke to bdnews24.com about the administration of a 75 million contribution to Bangladesh's Multi Donor Trust Fund. "We are in continued discussion with the Bangladesh government. We are working in close partnership with them, both on the challenge of tackling poverty and tackling climate change. Those conversations have been taking place in recent weeks and will continue for many weeks to come." Chars Livelihoods Programme Starting in April this year, the UK's Department for International Development will raise 100,000 more homes above the flood level, under the ongoing Chars Livelihoods Programme, working over the next six years. It will do this through a 'cash for work' scheme that will give local people almost six million days of paid employment. It will also provide livestock, seeds and saplings for the families living in the chars to ensure that they can make a decent living and improve their nutrition. The first phase of the project helped 700,000 people escape extreme poverty, raising more than 80,000 homesteads above the flood level. Livestock, seeds and other items were provided to almost 55,000 families in low-lying, flood-prone areas. Within two years, most households who participated in the programme saw their household income doubled. The remote chars, or river islands, in the Jamuna and Padma rivers in the northwest of Bangladesh are home to 2.5 million people. They are amongst the poorest in the country, living on the equivalent of Tk 15 or 15 pence a day. Half of char children under-five have stunted growth caused by malnutrition. Last week, Douglas Alexander also launched DFID's nutrition strategy  this will address the devastating impact that malnutrition has on life-expectancy, health and long-term productivity and will have the direct impact on the life chances of 12 million children globally by 2015. The strategy will focus on the six countries that are home to half of all the under nourished children under five in the world - Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Ethiopia, Nigeria and Zimbabwe. "The chars project has already made an enormous difference to some of the poorest people in Bangladesh. In the last few years, thousands of homes have been raised above the rising flood levels and local people have received better education, health and veterinary services," said Alexander. "Monga  the seasonal hunger  still affects millions of Bangladeshis every year. That is why we are also giving the poorest people livestock and seeds to see them through tough times," he said. English in Action Alexander also announced that a new English language programme will be increasing employment potential for 25 million Bangladeshis, by strengthening their English language skills and ultimately being in a stronger position to contribute to Bangladesh's continuing economic development. English in Action, an English language programme funded by UKaid, is enabling children, young people and adults in Bangladesh to learn English through innovative teaching methods, including radio, television, internet, MP3 players and mobile phones. Since its launch last November, more than one million people have used the BBC Janala mobile service, one of the projects supported under English in Action, which gives regular low-cost English language lessons on mobile phones. In addition, five million children and young people tuned into the new entertainment show 'BBC Buzz', aired every week on a local TV channel.
