 BORDEAUX, France, March 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Girondins Bordeaux reached the Champions League quarter-finals on Wednesday, though they made things hard for themselves in a 2-1 home win against Olympiakos Piraeus that gave them a 3-1 aggregate victory. Bordeaux had the game firmly in hand after Yoann Gourcuff scored a fifth-minute opener with a whipped free kick and Olympiakos striker Matt Derbyshire was sent off on the hour. However, the Greek side, who lost 1-0 at home in the first leg, levelled in the 65th thanks to substitute Kostas Mitroglou, three minutes before Bordeaux captain Alou Diarra was also sent off.

Four minutes later, the former AC Milan player fired another free kick that smashed the bar. Olympiakos had a goal disallowed on the stroke of halftime when Derbyshire was ruled to be offside when he deflected home a Lomana Lua Lua 25-metre shot. Olympiakos, reduced to 10 men when Derbyshire was sent off for a second bookable offence, looked thoroughly beaten but turned the tide. Mitroglou fired home a stunning volley from a throw-in and Bordeaux were also reduced to 10 men when Diarra got his second yellow card. Bordeaux's game deteriorated but the French champions held on until Chamakh sealed their progress when he headed home at the far post from a Tremoulinas c
