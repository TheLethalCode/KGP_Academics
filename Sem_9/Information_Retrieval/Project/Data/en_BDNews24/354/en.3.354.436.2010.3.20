<TEXT>
 Hobiganj, Mar 20 (bdnews24.com)  Former state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar has been sent to jail after facing five days of interrogation in connection with the Shah AMS Kibria murder case. The lawyer for the plaintiff Alamgir Babul told reporters on Saturday that Babar had appeared before the court after five days of remand. He said that magistrate Shahidul Islam ordered Babar to be sent back to jail as there were no further police petitions seeking his remand for questioning. Babar was sent to the Hobiganj district jail. Earlier on March 14, the court had given the police a five day period for interrogation. He was interrogated along with Mizanur Rahman Mithu, a leader of the banned Hurkatul Jihad. On Feb 11, Babar had previously been remanded for six days in relation to the same case. Babar was shown arrested in the case on Feb 2, following an order by a judicial magistrate in Hobiganj following a request by the criminal investigation department. The former state minister, who has been criticised for his role as state minister during the previous BNP government period, is currently serving a sentence of 17 years following his conviction in an arms case. State prosecutors have previously alleged that Babar had 'confessed' his role in the killing of Kibria, whilst he was being interrogated in relation to the August 21 grenade attack case. bdnews2
