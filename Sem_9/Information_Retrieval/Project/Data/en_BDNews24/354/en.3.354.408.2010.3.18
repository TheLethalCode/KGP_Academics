 Rangamati, Mar 18 (bdnews24.com)  An anti-CHT peace accord group has called off its blockade on roads and waterways in the hill districts of Rangamati, Khagrachharhi and Bandarban, scheduled for Thursday. The Parbatya Bangali Chhatra Parishad (PBCP) called to enforce the blockade demanding the release of its leader but withdrew it Wednesday night after authorities assured them of taking steps on the matter, said Md Shahjahan, the organisation president of the Rangamati chapter.
