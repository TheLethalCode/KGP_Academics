 Chittagong, Mar 21 (bdnews24.com)The CID has asked a Chittagong court for yet another time extension, the seventh in a row, for the lingering probe into the major seizure of 10 truckloads of arms in the port city in 2004. The CID's Moniruzzaman Chowdhury, investigation officer in the case, filed the request for a 90-day extension with the court of metropolitan judge Bhabani Prasad Singh, a day before the current deadline expires. Previously, on January 4, the court had provided a 76-day extension - which ends on Monday, when a hearing on the new request will be held. Chittagong police made the unprecedented weapons seizure at the secured jetty of Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Ltd on midnight of Apr 1, 2004. Two cases relating to the smuggling of weapons were filed. It is widely believed that the arms consignmentwhich according to the original FIR included rocket launchers, sub-machine guns, assault rifles and ammunitionwas meant to be transferred to the separatist group United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) for one of India's oldest insurgency wars. Officials of Bangladesh's main intelligence agencies, including the National Security Intelligence and the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence are implicated in the case as are members of the past BNP-led government including its former state minister for home. "There're still some important matters to be resolved," investigation officer Chowdhury told bdnews24.com on Sunday when asked about the most recent extension request. Specifically, the time has been requested so that we can question the security guards who were on duty during the incident, Chowdhury added. State counsel for the case and metropolitan prosecutor Kamal Uddin told bdnews24.com that the investigation "is close to the end". The reinvestigation into the case started during the previous army backed caretaker government in 2008 since the previous inquiry report was thought to be flawed. It was alleged that the past BNP-led government had influenced the investigation process to try to suppress the facts. The Chittagong court ordered further investigation into the case on Feb 12 2008 following a request by Ahsanul Huq Hena, the former metropolitan prosecutor. The CID appointed ASP Ismail Hossain as the new IO, who sought extensions on two occasions. On Jan 18 2009, following a state counsel request, the court ordered a change in the IO. Chowdhury, since replacing Hossain, has now sought five extensions. During that time, much sensational new information on the case leaked out during investigation. Local contractors Mohammed Hafizur Rehman and Din Mohammed, both prime accused in the arms haul case, arrested back in 2004, reportedly told investigators in March 2008 that the weapons had in fact been meant for the ULFA. Rehman also reportedly revealed that Paresh Barua, ULFA's military chief, had himself supervised the arms-smuggling operation. Both the primary accused allege they had tried to give evidence during the initial investigation in 2004, but were "threatened" into keeping quiet. The new CID investigators in a surprise move last year also arrested and interrogated two former NSI chiefs Maj Gen (retd) Rezzakul Haider Chowdhry and Brig Gen (retd) Abdur Rahim  who was a director of military intelligence outfit DGFI in 2004. Top navy officers and coastguard of the time have also been grilled. Investigators have also interrogated BNP's former state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar in the case. Babar is currently serving time behind bars having been convicted for possession of firearms. Lawyers of Babar, Rahim and Rezzakul have denied all accusations against their clients. Actual findings may emerge when the 10-truck arms case finally comes to trial after the current investigation ends and submission of the final charge-sheet. bdnews24.
