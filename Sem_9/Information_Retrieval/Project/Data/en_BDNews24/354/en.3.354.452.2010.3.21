 MILAN, Mar 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Exhausted Inter Milan risked surrendering their long-held Serie A lead after drawing 1-1 at fourth-placed Palermo on Saturday. AC Milan, two points adrift, can overtake Inter with a win at home to Napoli on Sunday (1400 GMT) while third-placed AS Roma are four points behind the leaders after Mirko Vucinic grabbed a hat-trick in a 4-2 victory at home to Udinese. Argentina striker Diego Milito gave Inter the lead on 11 minutes when he blasted home a penalty after Lucio had been hauled down by defender Cesare Bovo. Palermo, winners of seven home league games since Delio Rossi took over as coach in November, were level midway through the first half when Uruguay's Edinson Cavani fired in at the near post following Fabrizio Miccoli's clever pass. Either side could have won with Milito hitting the post from an impossible angle and heading just over before Cavani nodded wide for the Sicilian hosts.

"I'm angry as we could have won at the end," Palermo's man-of-the-match Miccoli told Sky TV. "But anyway we have drawn with champions Inter and the team deserves great applause."

Serie A top scorer Antonio Di Natale pulled one back for struggling Udinese with a debatable penalty on 38 minutes and then equalised in the second period before a Vucinic spotkick and his third goal restored Roma's advantage. Eighth-placed Fiorentina earlier boosted their hopes of a Europa League berth with a 3-0 home win over Genoa, who are seventh. Argentine forward Mario Santana scored with an audacious backheel on five minutes and Alberto Gilardino netted a second-half penalty after rowing with team mate Stevan Jovetic over who would take the kick following a foul on the Montenegrin. Substitute Khouma Babacar, 17, then slotted his first Serie A goal as Fiorentina moved within three points of sixth-placed Sampdoria, who fill the last guaranteed Europa League qualifying round spot and host Juventus on Sunday (1
