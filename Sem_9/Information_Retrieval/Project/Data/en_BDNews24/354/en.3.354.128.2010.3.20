 Dhaka, Mar 20 (bdnews24.com) -- Half-centuries from Tamim Iqbal and Mahmudullah helped Bangladesh to reach 330-8 at sumps on the first day of the second Test against England at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Saturday. At the close, Naeem Islam was unbeaten on 33 and Shafiul Islam (8). Earlier, the hosts opting to bat relied on Tamim to give them a rousing start with 85 off just 71 balls. The left-handed opener celebrated his 21st birthday with an electrifying innings before debutant off-spinner James Tredwell had him caught by wicketkeeper Matt Prior. Tamim, who was dropped by Collingwood off Tim Bresnan on 11 and by skipper Alastair Cook at mid on off Stuart Broad on 36, clubbed 13 fours and a six in his sixth Test fifty. But after his dismissal, Bangladesh struggled to put together partnerships as Graeme Swann returned to have debutant Jahirul Islam trapped lbw for a duck and then the England spinner removed Junaid Siddique (39) in the same fashion. Swann finished the day with 3-94. Mahmudullah's arrival at the crease halted the slide after the right-hander added 59 runs for the fifth-wicket with skipper Shakib Al Hasan, before being dismissed for 59, his fourth Test fifty. The Bangladesh captain was one of three wickets which fell after tea. Bogged down by the spinners, Shakib fell lbw to Tredwell for 49. Mushfiqur Rahim was playing second fiddle to Shakib before Tim Bresnan had the Bangladesh wicketkeeper caught behind for 30. England lead the two-match series 1-0 after completing a 181-run victory in Chittagong on Tue
