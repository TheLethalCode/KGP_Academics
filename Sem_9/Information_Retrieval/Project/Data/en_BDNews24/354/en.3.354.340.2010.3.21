 Dhaka, Mar 21 (bdnews24.com) -- Pune and Kochi were unveiled as the two new IPL franchises, joining the tournament from the 2011 edition, reports Cricinfo. While Pune was bought by Sahara Adventure Sports Group for $370 million, the Kochi franchise was snapped up by Rendezvous Sports World Limited for $333.3 million. In fact, Sahara had the highest bids for three cities - Ahmedabad, Pune and Nagpur - but it eventually opted for Pune. Unveiling the winners at the ITC Park Sheraton in Chennai on Sunday, Lalit Modi, the IPL commissioner said, "There were five qualified bids and the bidding was extremely competitive." He also indicated that the franchise fee was for 10 years.
