 Dhaka, Mar 18 (bdnews24.com)  Ruling party Awami League launched a month-long 'mass communication tour' across the country on Thursday, to convey the government's future plans to the grassroots and "to hear what the public have to say". It is also an attempt by the ruling party to stoke public opinion "against the opposition's negative politics", AL leaders have said. Central party leaders have been divided into 15 groups to run the programme. They will hold public rallies and extended meetings in their assigned districts. The tour kicks off with rallies and meetings in Nilphamari, Chapainawabganj, Rajshahi and Sunamganj on Thursday. "The leaders will inform people about the country's present political condition and the ruling party's future plans. We will recruit new members too," AL deputy office secretary Mrinal Kanti Das told bdnews24.com. The ruling party has said it will also seek public opinion and suggestions for the government during the month-long tour and present them to the prime minister. "We want to hear what people expect from the government," AL joint general secretary Mahbub ul Hanif said earlier this month. He said the tour was also intended "to make people aware of the opposition's negative politics." "We want people to create public pressure against the four-party alliance," Hanif had said. BNP has said it is launching a similar tour from Mar 27 to mobilise public opinion against the policies of the AL-led grand alliance government. bd
