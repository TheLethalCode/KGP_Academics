<TITLE> CCC building 'illegal' shops on riverbanks </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Mar 17 (bdnew24.com)The Chittagong City Corporation is allegedly constructing shops along the Karnaphuli river banks, defying port authority regulations. A construction company hired by the CCC is filling the land along a one-kilometre strip on the river bank near the Ring Road for constructing shops. The Chittagong Port Authority, which owns the land, said it didn't give permission for any such constructions. It is reportedly sending a letter to the corporation asking it to stop constructing the illegal structures. A visit to the site revealed that CCC-employed contractor, Syed Constructions, have filled a one-kilometre strip on the river bank from Fishery Ghat to Chaktai Chamrar Gudam alongside Ring Road. Constructions of walls to house the shops are now underway. Syed Constructions' workers said that one hundred shops will be built on the stretch and rented out. Other than the under-construction CCC shops, signboards of 'Bastuhara Sramik League' and 'Chittagong Fishery Ghat Loading-Unloading Sramik Union' were also seen in the area. The Corporation, however, claimed that they are constructing the shops on the footpath along Ring Road following regulations. The Port authority however, refuted its claim, saying that even though CCC was given road construction permit, they do not have permission to construct the shops. Abul Hasnat, an engineer of CCC, told bdnews24.com that the shops are being built on a temporary basis on the footpath alongside Ring Road in an effort to prevent illegal occupation of the land. He, however, refrained from revealing any further information, saying he needs clearance from the city mayor. An official of the port authority's estate department, on condition of anonymity, told bdnews24.com that CCC is land filling without permission. He said that he has heard of the construction work and that "a show cause letter would be issued by the port authority to the corporation regarding the matter." "If we don't get any reply, then an eviction drive led by a magistrate would be conducted", the port official said. A survey conducted by Chittagong Environment Directorate in January revealed that 39 government and non-government organisations are involved in illegal occupation of the river area, causing pollution along the banks of Karnaphuli River. These organisations have seriously hampered the flow of the river by grabbing river area. Karnaphuli, which is the heart of the city, is shrinking by the day because of irresponsible and unplanned development on both banks of the river. Environment groups blame the government organisations for taking no action against the illegal occupants. Shahriar Khaled, member secretary of Chittagong Forum, told bdnews24.com that the city needs to develop, but it should be in a planned way. He also demanded immediate eviction of illegal establishments by demarcating river area. Similar allegations have risen against the corporation during its attempt to construct a multi-storied market by demolishing the historical Arpanacharan City Corporation High School, which was stopped in the face of mass general protest. Another of its attempt met the same fate when they tried to construct a multi-storied housing building on Char Chaktai School's field.
