<TEXT>
 Cox's Bazar, Mar 20 (bdnews24.com)The BNP chairperson's adviser Shawkat Mahmud and up to 1200 BNP supporters on Saturday publicly asserted that former president Ziaur Rahman was the "declarer of independence" despite a minister's warning last week that such a statement would have dire consequences. "The declaration of independence was not something that was whispered in secret. The whole world knows Zia was the declarer," Mahmud said at a grassroots representative meeting in the southern town of Cox's Bazar. State minister for law Qamrul Islam on Mar 13 warned that anyone who claims Ziaur Rahman declared Bangladesh's independence "will face charges for violating the constitution". The High Court on June 21 last year ruled that Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh's founding president, not Ziaur Rahman, proclaimed independence from Pakistan in 1971. The Supreme Court later upheld the ruling. Qamrul said anyone who contradicts the Supreme Court ruling in speech, by maintaining Zia as the declarer, would be violating the constitution. Saturday's BNP meeting was attended by around 1200 grassroots level leaders and activists of the party and its associate organisations from Cox's Bazar, Bandarbans and Chittagong South. At the beginning of his speech, Mahmud asked the audience, "Who is the declarer of independence?" "Shaheed Ziaur Rahman," the representatives shouted back. "According to a court ruling, Zia is not the declarer of independence. Do you agree?" Mahmud. "No! No!" the audience replied. Mahmud, referring the state minister for law Qamrul Islam, said, "But the so-called lawyer said measures will be taken against those who violate the ruling." "But first you've to try Shaheed Tajuddin (Ahmed), who expressed his gratitude to Ziaur Rahman for declaring independence. "Indira Gandhi, who also addressed Zia as the declarer, has to face trial too." "Bangabandhu himself never claimed it and so felt embarrassed to put his own name as the declarer in the constitution," Mahmud added. Addressing prime minister Sheikh Hasina, he said, "You could return Bangladesh and become the prime minister only because of Shaheed Zia." He said the prime minister should "salute" Zia's mausoleum when traveling to and from to Gano Bhaban, her official residence. Mahmud also issued a warning. "You can't stay in Bangladesh if you try to dismantle Shaheed Zia's shrine and remove Khaleda Zia from her cantonment house." "Your hands will be crushed," he said. Other discussants of the meeting claimed that conspiracies were on against Tarique Rahman, elder son of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia and the late Zia Rahman. The conspiracies will be dissolved when Tarique returned, they said. Tarique, the senior vice-president of BNP, is now in the UK. He is accused in a raft corruption cases. bdne
