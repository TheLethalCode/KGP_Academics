 BANGKOK, Mar 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tens of thousands of opposition activists vowed on Friday to press ahead with anti-government protests, preparing for a new drive to win over Bangkok's politically powerful middle classes. The demonstrators remained at their base in Bangkok's historic heart, dancing to live folk music, listening to fiery speeches decrying the military's intervention in politics and planning Saturday's city-wide recruitment march. Investors are however convinced there is no danger to Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva and have poured 35.3 billion baht (718 million pounds) into Thailand's stock market in the last month. The bourse was up 1.1 percent at a 20-month high on Friday, returning to positive territory after a day of profit-taking on Thursday snapped a six-day run of gains. The "red-shirt" protesters plan to fan out across the city of 15 million people on motorcycles and pickup trucks on Saturday, handing out leaflets and calling on urban sympathisers to join their push to oust the government. "We want to win the hearts of Bangkok people," Nattawut Saikua, one of the protest leaders, told Reuters. "We have already proven to them that we are genuine and non-violent. We want them to help us topple this hypocritical government." Analysts said it would be a tough task. "There is no case so far for the protest to gain mass support to overthrow the Abhisit government," Citigroup analyst Suchart Techaposai said in a research note. But that is what the protest leaders are trying to change. CONVINCING THE UNDECIDED The mainly rural supporters of former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, who was overthrown in a coup and later convicted of graft, are seeking to lure Bangkok middle classes, civil servants and rank-and-file soldiers and policemen to their battle against the government and influential establishment elite. Their aim is to diversify their support base, strengthen their legitimacy and sustain a crowd that appears to be waning. While few expect the rally to topple the government, a prolonged protest could start to undermine the leadership of a premier unable to visit his office, parliament, or his home, opting instead to stay at a fortified military compound. However, some of the most ardent "red shirts" are beginning to succumb to fatigue and leaders are seeking reinforcements. The number of protesters peaked at up to 150,000 on Sunday although tens of thousands still remain. Some vowed to stay until the end, whenever that will be. "There is no money at my farm. At least here, we are doing something important, and I'm not paid to be here," said Supalak Pumarin, from Udon Thani province, who, like many "red shirts," refutes common claims the masses were hired. Analysts said the support base for the campaign appeared to be diversifying, but convincing Bangkok residents to join their movement could prove difficult, especially given the strong aversion to Thaksin among many in the capital. "It's no longer rural versus urban and it has ceased to be the case for some time," said Charnvit Kasertsiri, a political historian. "There is a lot of support for the reds even in Bangkok. The question is: Can they bring them out to the street
