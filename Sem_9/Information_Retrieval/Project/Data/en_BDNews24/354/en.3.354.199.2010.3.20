 bdnews24.com New Delhi correspondent New Delhi, March 20 (bdnews24.com)  The two-day joint river commission ministerial meeting in New Delhi failed to strike a deal as expected on sharing of Teesta river, apparently because of West Bengal. Both New Delhi and Dhaka claimed that the JRC talks between water ministers Ramesh Chandra Sen and Indian counterpart Pawan Kumar Bansal made significant progress towards an agreement for sharing of water of the common river during dry season. But Indian analysts stressed that the central government in New Delhi could not strike a deal without protecting West Bengal's interests which is also dependent on a fair share of Teesta water for irrigation and hydropower generation. India on Saturday said that the next move towards inking an agreement on Teesta might be made in just a couple of months. New Delhi also sought to stress that both sides have agreed to conclude an interim agreement on the issue and it should be seen as one of the positive outcomes of the meeting. The joint press-release issued at the end of the JRC meeting late at night on Friday termed the exchange of drafts as a "significant movement forward" on the issue of sharing of water of Teesta. India presented a draft Statement of Principles for sharing the Teesta water during the dry season, while Bangladesh also gave India a draft of an interim agreement for the same purpose. Sen and Bansal told journalists that the JRC meet, which was held after a gap of five years, helped both sides understand each other's position better and decide on the future courses of cooperation. Both ministers asked their respective water resources secretaries to examine the drafts presented by both sides for "an expeditious conclusion of an interim agreement on Teesta". Indian Water Resources Secretary Umesh Narain Panjiyar said that he and his Bangladesh counterpart Sheikh Md Wahid uz Zaman could meet as early as in May to make the next move towards an interim agreement. Highly-placed Indian officials said that New Delhi was aware that sharing of water of the common rivers was a sensitive issue in Bangladesh and that Dhaka had "high expectation" from the latest JRC ministerial meet. But, they argued, it was not possible to narrow down all the differences on a highly technical issue like water-sharing in the two-day meet, which had taken place for the first time after 2005. But Abdur Rob Khan, Associate Professor of International Relations at Dhaka's North South University, told bdnews24.com that the failure to strike an interim agreement on Teesta itself could be construed as a setback in Bangladesh, particularly when the processes to resolve the long-standing bilateral issues was believed to have gained momentum after prime minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to New Delhi in January. "The significance of an interim agreement on Teesta for the Awami League government is more political than technical," said Khan, who was here for the India-Bangladesh Security Dialogue jointly organized by the Bangladesh Enterprise Institute and Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. But Sreeradha Datta, a research fellow of the India's premier think-tank Institute of Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA), said that failure of the JRC to deliver an interim agreement on Teesta in its first ministerial meet since 2005 should not be seen as a setback for Delhi-Dhaka relations as the Indian government had possibly found it difficult to enter into an ad hoc arrangement without settling some technical issues. Datta, who closely monitors India-Bangladesh relations, pointed out that the central government in New Delhi would have to ensure that the state of West Bengal continued to get a fair share of Teesta water for irrigation and hydropower generation. She, however, added that a political statement from New Delhi reassuring Dhaka on the issue of Teesta could indeed be helpful in keeping the momentum towards forging a better relation between the two countries, especially after Sheikh Hasina's visit. Sen on Friday called on Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh and finance minister Pranab Mukherjee before having his last round of meeting with Bansal. He is believed to have requested Singh and Mukherjee to give a political push to the efforts to narrow down the differences on the Teesta issue. According to sources, both Singh and Mukherjee had assured Sen that New Delhi understood Dhaka's concern over availability of Teesta water during dry season and its impact on the country's agricultural production. But Singh and Mukherjee had also reportedly told Sen that the Indian government would have to take into account the opinions of the West Bengal government before striking a deal with Bangladesh on Teesta since the Indian Constitution categorized water as one of the subjects under the purview of the state government. West Bengal irrigation and waterways minister Subhash Naskar was present during the JRC meet that began last Thursday. Apart from Teesta, the JRC also had comprehensive discussions on water sharing of other common rivers, drinking water supply and minor lift irrigation schemes on Feni and Muhuri rivers, implementation of 1996 Ganga Waters Treaty, bank protection and embankment repair works, cooperation in flood forecasting and warning arrangements, cooperation in flood management measures including dredging of Ichhamati river, Tipaimukh Dam Project and river inter-linking project in India. Both Sen and Bansal expressed satisfaction at the bank protection and embankments repair works being undertaken by mutual agreement on several sites in both countries. In addition to the 66 sites already agreed, both sides finalized 12 new Indian and 22 new Bangladesh sites for bank protection and embankment repair works. They also expressed satisfaction at the on-going dredging activities on Ichhamati river. Bangladesh agreed to allow India to withdraw 1.82 cusec of water from Feni River for drinking water supply schemes. Besides, in order to give Bangladesh more lead time for advance warning of floods, India in a special gesture, agreed to provide flood data to enhance the lead time to more than 57 hours. bdn
