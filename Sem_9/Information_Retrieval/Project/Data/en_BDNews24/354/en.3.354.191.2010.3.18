 Dhaka, Mar 18 (bdnews24.com)  Election to the vacated Bhola-3 constituency will be held on April 24, the Election Commission announced on Thursday. The deadline for submission of nominations is Mar 29 and for withdrawals is April 8. The EC declared the constituency void on Feb 3 as ruling Awami League MP Mohammad Jashimuddin, a retired army officer, contested the 2008 general election before waiting the required time following his retirement. According to electoral law, a new election must be held within 90 days of vacation of any parliamentary seat. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda told a press briefing that they had fixed the date keeping in mind the Higher Secondary Certificate exams, which will be held between April 1 and May 18. There are exams scheduled for April 22 and 25. But there is no exam on April 24, Huda said. The final voter list of Bhola-3 was published on Monday. There are about 2.20 lakh voters in the constituency, comprising Lalmohan and Tajmuddin upazilas. The Supreme Court recently upheld a High Court ruling that declared Jashim's candidacy as unlawful following a petition by his closest rival in the election Hafizuddin Ahmed. Hafiz said Jashim contested the general election violating a restriction that barred a retired army officer to run in a general election before expiration of the proper waiting period. Bangladesh electoral law stipulates that none can enter for national election within three years from the date of retirement and within five years after forced retirement from any public office. Jashimuddin was forced to retire from the army on Aug 31 2004, and contested the general election in December 2008. He won the seat with around 12,000 votes more than Hafiz, who went on to challenge the validity of Jashim's candidacy in the High Court. 'STRICT ACTION' IF CODE BREACHED, CEC WARNS The chief election commissioner reminded all that ministers, state ministers, deputy ministers or officials of similar rank are not allowed to participate in any election campaign. Huda asked that aspiring candidates remove campaign posters by Mar 22. He warned of "tough action" if anybody was found violating the electoral code of conduct. Huda said the EC would hold a free and fair election in Bhola-3. Hafiz, who will enter the race as a candidate of the opposition BNP, in a recent press conference said he was "afraid whether the election will be held peacefully". The EC has said around 24 personnel of different law enforcement agencies will be deployed in each polling centre, under a sub-inspector of police or equivalent, of which 14 will be armed. Executive and judicial magistrates, Rpid Action Battalion and police forces will be deployed outside the polling centres. There will also be election officials appointed as observers by the EC. bd
