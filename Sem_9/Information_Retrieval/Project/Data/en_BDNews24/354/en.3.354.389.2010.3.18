 Dhaka, Mar 18 (bdnews24.com)  The Dhaka City Corporation is set to launch an overnight drive against illegal billboards in the capital from Thursday evening, and to continue the drives on a weekly basis thereafter. The move comes less than a week after two people were killed as a sudden storm ripped down a billboard in the capital's Gulshan area. Last month billboards at Bijoy Sarani and Dhanmondi fell, causing injuries. DCC chief planner Sirajul Islam told bdnews24.com that the drive would begin at 9.30 pm Thursday and would continue till 5 am the next morning. All illegal billboards of DCC's zone-5, areas adjacent to Shahbagh police station, would be the first to be dismantled in the first drive, Islam said. "The drives will continue every Thursday", he said. According to Islam, there are an estimated 2,500 illegal billboards and mega signs in the citythough DCC admits even they don't know the exact numbermany of which are in a hazardous situation. "Lethal accidents can occur anytime", he told bdnews24.com earlier in the week. The owner of the billboard that fell and killed two people at the Gulshan Shopping Centre on Mar 15 failed to obtain permission from the DCC to build the structure, and ignored a number of DCC notices demanding that he remove the illegal billboard, Islam has said. bdne
