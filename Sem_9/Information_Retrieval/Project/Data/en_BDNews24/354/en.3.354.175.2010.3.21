<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 20 (bdnews24.com)  The telecoms regulator filed a case on Saturday against 12 RanksTel executives including its chairman A Rauf Chowdhury. Tejgaon police chief Omar Faruk told bdnews24.com that Md Kawsar Ahmed, a BTRC officer filed the case under the Telecommunication Act-2001 for illegally operating unauthorised VoIP trade. RAB personnel on Mar 19 arrested general manager (engineering) Sheikh Kamruzzaman, deputy general manager (engineering) Mominur Rahman Chowdhury and deputy general manager (sales) Iqbal Karim Bhuiyan Noman after an overnight drive of the telephone company's office. The other eight accused in the case are the directors Amanullah Chowdhury, Anwar Hossain, Ashraf Uddin, Fazle Selm, Zakia Rauf Chowdhury, Jhumu Rauf Chowdhury, Suana Rauf Chowdhury and AKM Samsuddin. Meanwhile, Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Shamima Parvin on Saturday rejected a bail petition filed by the three already arrested RanksTel officials. The court also rejected a remand petition by the police to hold them for questioning. "The court said that it is a responsibility of experts to enquire whether they (RanksTel) have legal licences, not of police or RAB," BTRC junior adviser Kawsar Ahmed said. RanksTel, a private land phone operator, was the third company to be raided by BTRC on suspicion of illegal VoIP operations in under a week. The telecoms regulator in two previous raids, on Mar 14 and 16, said it found evidence of illegal call operations against telephone companies Dhaka Phone and WorldTel. Five top executives of Dhaka Phone officials were sent to jail after being arrested on charges of running unlicensed VoIP operations. The BTRC drives were initiated just days after opposition chief whip Zainul Abdin Farroque on Mar 12 accused the prime minister's son Sajeeb Ahmed Wazed of being involved in the illegal VoIP trade. A stream of heated statements was exchanged between the top-ranking leaders of ruling Awami League and the main opposition BNP. A total of 11 defamation cases have since been filed against Farroque by Awami League supporters in different districts of the country for his allegations against Sajeeb. bdnews
