<TEXT>
 Satkhira, Mar 21 (bdnews24.com)  A Satkhira special court resumed trial of BDR mutiny suspects after a two-month break on Sunday. The special court, situated at the 41 Rifles Battalion headquarters, began hearing witnesses from 10 am in the case against 60 BDR guards of Nildumur, accused of taking up arms in rebellion and solidarity with the Pilkhana mutineers in February 2009. The court was previously adjourned on Jan 21 after 15 witnesses had testified. A total of 40 witnesses have been called for the trial. The witnesses described the events that took place in front of the Nildumur camp on Feb 25-26 last year. They said the accused border guards tried to provoke other BDR members to rebel by telling them that "the army was about to crackdown on them". Witnesses said the accused installed heavy arms on the Satkhira-Kaliganj and Satkhira-Burigoalini roads "to counter the army". The suspects also allegedly beat up innocent people and were "hunting for" the 7 Rifles Battalion commander Lt Col Ameer Md Arif and medical officer Maj Reazul Islam. BDR director Gen Mainul Islam heads a three-member judge's panel. The other two members are Lt Col Gazi Md Khalid and Maj Lutful Kabir. Deputy attorney general Khashruzzaman is filling in for the attorney general. The bloody Feb 25-26 mutiny saw over 70 people brutally killed, nearly 60 of them army officers deputed to the border force. Rebellion also spread to other BDR outposts around the country. On Nov 15, the government formed six special courts, including two in Dhaka, to try some 3,500 border guards accused in some 40 cases around the country. The first of the mutiny trials began at Rangamati on Nov 24. Along with Satkhira, trials are also ongoing in Feni and Thakurgaon. The Pilkhana mutiny trial began in Dhaka, at Darbar Hall, last month. In the event of a guilty finding, the maximum penalty for rebellion under the BDR Act is seven years in jail. The six special courts are trying charges of mutiny, looting and arson. The killings will be tried separately under civil law, which holds the maximum death penalty. bdn
