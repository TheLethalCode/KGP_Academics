 bdnews24.com Beijing correspondent Beijing, Mar 18 (bdnews24.com) -- Beijing has assured Dhaka of extending duty-free access for Bangladeshi products to the Chinese market. Chinese premier Wen Jiabao made the assurance at official talks with prime minister Sheikh Hasina at the Great Hall in Beijing on Thursday evening. Bangladesh is supposed to have duty-free access for around 90 products to China under the Bangkok Agreement. But the 90 items do not include Bangladesh's main export items. The prime minister's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad told journalists after the talks that the two leaders discussed bilateral, regional and international issues. During the talks, Wen Jiabao said he hoped the two countries would enhance cooperation for safeguarding peace, stability and development of South Asia. Azad said Hasina requested her Chinese counterpart to extend financial support for development projects, cooperation for power and agricultural sector, and technical assistance for achieving the development targets, and the Jiabao assured her of offering the support and assistance. During the talks, Bangladesh signed three accords and a memorandum of understanding with China for cooperation in economy, technology, infrastructure and energy. The accords are an Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement, a Framework Agreement on Shahjalal Fertiliser Factory and an Agreement on the 7th Bangladesh-China Friendship Bridge. The MoU is on oil and energy cooperation. Dipu Moni, industries minister Dilip Barua and communications minister Syed Abul Hossain signed the accords and ambassador to China Munshi Faiz Ahmad signed the MoUs on behalf of Bangladesh. The two prime ministers discussed a number of projects, including the Chittagong-Kunming railway and road links through Myanmar, second Padma Bridge, deep seaport in Chittagong, eighth Bangladesh-China Friendship Bridge, capacity-building in agriculture, telecommunications and solar energy. Hasina sought greater Chinese investment in Bangladesh that might contribute to reducing the trade gap, heavily in favour of China.
