 Dhaka, Mar 21 (bdnews24.com)  Security experts have warned that Bangladesh could become a country of choice for international terrorists to take cover, with assistance from existing militant networks. "Terrorists are trying to find new places to hide out as Afghanistan and Pakistan authorities are becoming tough on militants," Maj Gen ANM Muniruzzaman, president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies (BIPSS), told a seminar on Sunday. "They might consider Bangladesh as one of the next suitable places," He said BIPSS research showed there are more than 30 militant organisations based in Bangladesh. "These organisations would be helpful for those trying to take cover here." Muniruzzaman stressed the need for joint collaboration by South Asian countries to address the problem. "It cannot be curbed without mutual cooperation," he said. Local and foreign security experts were taking part in the five-day seminar. John Harrison, head of research of Singapore based International Centre for Political Violence and Terrorism Research, pointed out inadequate security measures of Shahjalal International Airport. As airports were becoming the prime target of terrorists across the world, tardy security measures at Bangladesh's international airport were a cause for concern, he said. bd
