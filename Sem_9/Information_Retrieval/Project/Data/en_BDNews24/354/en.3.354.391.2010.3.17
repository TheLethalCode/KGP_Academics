<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 17 (bdnews24.com)Finance minister M A Muhith has said that before June the government might sign a contract with a company under a Public Private Partnership (PPP) to construct an 'elevated express way' in the capital. "The 'feasibility study' is now under way," he said on Wednesday. The minister, however, gave no hint about the private company involved. At the time of the last budget, the government estimated that the cost of this project would be USD 1.23 billion. The minister also said that government received other proposals from the private sector to build power plants under the PPP. In the last budget, the government had published a booklet on PPP. This contained a list of 7 mega projects including that of the 'Elevated expressway'. However, until now, there has been very little progress with any of these initiatives. Muhith admitted the lack of success so far with PPPs and explained that as a result "We are planning in the amended budget to reduce the amount of money allocated to PPPs by Tk 500 crore to Tk 2000 crores." bdne
