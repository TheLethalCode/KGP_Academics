 KABUL, Mar 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan President Hamid Karzai gave more authority on Thursday to an anti-graft body as part of a campaign against corruption that has been closely watched by Western countries with troops fighting in Afghanistan. Karzai won plaudits from the West last November when he announced plans for a crackdown on graft, but some diplomats have since said they had yet to see the sort of decisive measures they were expecting. Western countries say corruption in Karzai's government is endemic, and a fundamental threat to their efforts to stabilise the country that ranks alongside the resurgent Taliban insurgency and the illegal drugs trade. Attorney General Mohammad Ishaq Aloko said Karzai's decree would give the High Office of Oversight and Anti-corruption the power to suspend and detain government officials.

"Some ministers are being investigated and some have their cases completed and will be referred to the court and have their affidavit prepared," Aloko told same briefing. The accused ministers will have their files studied by a newly formed court set up more than two months ago, called the Special Tribunal of Anti-administrative Corruption, he said. Karzai concedes corruption is rife in his government, but says the problem has been exaggerated in Western media. He has repeatedly said that the biggest cause of corruption is poor oversight among Western donors of their own billions in aid contracts, which dwarf Afghanistan's budget. Western officials concede that poor oversight of their aid efforts contributes to the problem. Defence Secretary Robert Gates said this month that the United States must do more to clean up its own contracting procedu
