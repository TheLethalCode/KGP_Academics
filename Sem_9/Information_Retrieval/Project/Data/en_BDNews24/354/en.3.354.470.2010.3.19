 bdnews24.com Beijing Correspondent Beijing, Mar 19 (bdnews24.com) -- Prime minister Sheikh Hasina sought to reduce the trade gap with Beijing on Friday, the second day of her five-day visit to China, and invited investment in "promising sectors" in Bangladesh. She also sought Chinese assistance in the proposed deep-sea port at Chittagong that Bangladesh hopes will become a regional hub. Addressing the Bangladesh-China Business Forum at state guest house Diaoutha in Beijing, Hasina said she expected bilateral trade between Dhaka and Beijing would increase to $5 billion in 2010 from $4.58 billion in 2009. Mentioning that the balance of trade is heavily in Beijing's favour, the prime minister sought vigorous efforts from Bangladeshi and Chinese businessmen to contribute to reducing the trade gap. According to the Bangladesh government, the trade gap between the two countries was almost $4 billion as of June 2009. 'PROMISING INVESTMENT SECTORS' Hasina invited investment. "I would like to urge you to invest in Bangladesh's promising sectors like textiles, machineries, fertilisers, gas and energy, footwear, ceramics, IT outsourcing and healthcare," she said. She also urged Chinese entrepreneurs to invest in IT tourism, education, power, telecommunications, infrastructure development, agro-based industries and pharmaceuticals. The prime minister sought Chinese assistance in constructing Bangladesh's proposed deep-sea port at Chittagong and establishing road link between Chittagong and Kunming. She said not only China but also all neighboring countries would benefit from a deep-sea port at Bangladesh. She said the investment climate and fiscal policy in Bangladesh are very conducive for foreign investment. She listed tax holiday, concessionary duty on imported machinery, avoidance of double taxation, allowing highest foreign equity, unrestricted exit policy and full repatriation facilities of dividend and capital as attraction of foreign investment in Bangladesh. Hasina also urged the Chinese entreprenuers to avail themselves of the newly introduced Public-Private Partnership arrangement to make investments in Bangladesh. The China Council for Promotion of International Trade and Bangladesh Embassy in Beijing jointly hosted the reception at state guest house Diaoutha, attended by leading Chinese businessmen and investors and government officials. Foreign minister Dipu Moni, industries minister Dilip Barua and communication minister Syed Abul Hossain, Chinese deputy foreign minister and director of the Chinese Council for International Trade Zhang Wei also addressed the gathering. Bangladesh and China signed three accords and one memorundum of understanding on the first day of the prime minister's visit. The three accords are: Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement, Framework Agreement on Shahjalal Fertiliser Factory, and the Agreement on the 7th Bangladesh-China Friendship Bridge, and the MoU on oil and energy cooperation.
