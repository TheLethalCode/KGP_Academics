"The death toll may rise, but so far we have information that six militants were killed in both incidents," said an intelligence official in Miranshah. While it insists on getting US drone technology, Pakistan has launched two major offensives in the northwest over the past year against homegrown Taliban militants who want to topple the US-backed government of President Asif Ali Zardari.
