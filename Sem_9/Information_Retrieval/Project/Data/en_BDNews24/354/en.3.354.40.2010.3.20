 DHAKA, Mar 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tamim Iqbal blasted a rapid half-century before England's spinners put the brakes on Bangladesh's progress to leave the hosts on 139 for three at lunch the opening day of the second test on Saturday. Tamim celebrated his 21st birthday with some fireworks of his own, attacking every England bowler before debutant off-spinner James Tredwell had him caught by wicketkeeper Matt Prior for 85 off just 71 balls. The left-handed opener made his intentions clear when he got off the mark with a boundary off the first ball of the innings and completed his fifty in just 34 deliveries with three successive fours off the bowling of Graeme Swann. He blasted the next ball for a six to take 20 runs from what was Swann's third over in the game as Bangladesh made the most of their decision to bat after winning the toss. Tamim, who was dropped by Paul Collingwood off Tim Bresnan on 11 and by skipper Alastair Cook at mid on off Stuart Broad on 36, clubbed 13 fours and a six in his sixth test fifty. Bangladesh raced to 95 runs in the first hour thanks to Tamim's aggression before the introduction of Tredwell slowed down their run riot. After Tredwell ended Tamim's 66-run second wicket stand with Zunaed Siddique, Swann showed he had recovered from his earlier battering by trapping debutant Jahirul Islam for an lbw. Zunaed Siddique (25 not out) was batting with Mahmudullah (11 not out) at the interval. Earlier, Broad ended 53-run opening stand between Tamim and Imrul Kayes, with Steven Finn taking a fine catch diving to his right to dismiss the latter for 12. England lead the two-match series 1-0 after completing a 181-run victory in Chittagong on Tue
