 Dhaka, Mar 18 (bdnews24.com)  The Dhaka City Corporation launched an overnight drive against illegal billboards in the capital from Thursday evening. The move comes less than a week after two people were killed as a sudden storm ripped down a billboard in the capital's Gulshan area. Last month billboards at Bijoy Sarani and Dhanmondi fell, causing injuries. DCC chief planner Sirajul Islam told bdnews24.com that the drive was beginning at 9.30 pm Thursday and would continue till 5 am the next morning. All illegal billboards of DCC's zone-5, areas adjacent to Shahbagh police station, would be the first to be dismantled in the first drive, Islam said. According to Islam, there are an estimated 2,500 illegal billboards and mega signs in the citythough DCC admits even they don't know the exact numbermany of which are in a hazardous situation. "Lethal accidents can occur anytime", he told bdnews24.com earlier in the week. The owner of the billboard that fell and killed two people at the Gulshan Shopping Centre on Mar 15 failed to obtain permission from the DCC to build the structure, and ignored a number of DCC notices demanding that he remove the illegal billboard, Islam has said. RAJUK MOVES AGAINST ILLEGAL ESTABLISHMENTS Meanwhile, Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha in a special drive on Thursday removed over 50 illegal establishments in the Gulshan area. The drive held between 10am and 2pm was managed by RAJUK magistrate Rokon Ud-Doula. Over 50 unauthorised structures, including makeshift homes, motor garages and shops between Gulshan Shooting Club and Badda Ring Road were removed, the magistrate told bdnews24.com. The residents and owners of the establishments were given advance notice, he added. bdne
