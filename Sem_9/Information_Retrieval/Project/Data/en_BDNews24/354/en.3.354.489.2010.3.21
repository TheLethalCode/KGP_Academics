 Dhaka, Mar 21 (bdnews24.com)  Oil tanker owners have threatened suspension of operations from Mar 24 if the government does not cancel a plan to procure additional vessels. At present there are 81 coastal ships used for transporting oil across the country from seaports. "As the use of petroleum has plummeted by around 35 percent in recent years, due to an increase in CNG (compressed natural gas) the companies cannot run more than two trips a day at present," Oil Tanker Owners Association president TM Giasuddin told a press briefing on Sunday. Many oil tankers already face huge losses everyday as they do not get enough trips in a day but have to keep up for costly maintenance of the ships, he said. Under these circumstances, an "influential quarter" of the government is planning to add another 30/40 ships, alleged Gias. "If the ships are brought in  the whole industry will be in crisis," he added.
