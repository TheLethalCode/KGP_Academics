 Dhaka, Mar 17 (bdnews24.com)  Launch operations across the country remained suspended for the second day on Wednesday paralysing the water routes as launch workers continued with their indefinite strike. The Water Vessel Workers Federation imposed the strike from Monday midnight to press for their 22-point demand which included the formulation of a minimum wage, a proper salary structure and issue of appointment letters. The Sadarghat terminal was almost empty, though.police were deployed in the area. Syed Mahfuz, an official of the Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority, who was on duty at the Sadarghat terminal, said that no launch was operating. In the morning, the federation held a rally at the Sadarghat terminal in support of the strike They vowed to continue their programme until their demands were met. Shah Alam, vice president of the federation, told bdnews24.com: "Since we have not received any positive response from the government, we will continue our programmes ." He criticised the shipping minister Shajahan Khan for his previous day's comment that the "federation was not a trade union, so legally it has no right to bargain." Alam said the minister should not have commented in this way about the organisation, which is now 32-years old. He said the minister was trying to protect the launch owners and he did not have any concern for the workers. Launch owners remain highly critical of the strike. Bodiuzzaman Badal, vice president of Bangladesh Inter Water Vessels Association, said the workers' demands are "illogical and illegal". He said that on Monday it had convened a meeting, which would have been held today Wednesday, to try and resolve workers's concerns, but the workers' federation simply went on strike. bd
