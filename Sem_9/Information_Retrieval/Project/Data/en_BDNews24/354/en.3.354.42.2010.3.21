<TEXT>
 Bagerhat, Mar 21 (bdnews24.com)  More than a hundred forest department workers, fire fighters and local people were trying to douse a forest fire in the Sundarbans on Sunday, 24 hours after it broke out. The fire that started Saturday afternoon in the Chandpai range of the Sundarbans east division had spread across about five acres of forest by Sunday, officials said. Mihir Kumar Dey, Sundarbans (east division) forest officer, told bdnews24.com that the fire originated at Payshatti Chhila in Gulishakhali camp. He said that the fire fighters were managing to keep the fire under control by digging deep ditches around the fire-hit area. Dey, however, could not say how long it would take to quench the flames. He said the forest department could not yet discover the cause of the fire. But Sheikh Mizanur Rahman, deputy chief forest conservator, said fallen leaves were lying about six to nine inches thick on the forest floor at this time of year. "Flammable methane gas is produced when those leaves decompose." "This area (Payshatti Chhila) is very dry from February to April every year. Therefore, there is always a possibility of fire," he said. At least nine fires have broken out at different places of the east division of the Sundarbans, consisting of Chandpai and Sharankhola ranges, since 2001. bdne
