 Dhaka, Mar 19 (bdnews24.com) -- Praveen Kumar recorded the first hat-trick of Indian Premier League 3 as a dominant Royal Challengers Bangalore mauled a sorry-looking Rajasthan Royals by 10 wickets to notch up their second consecutive win in the Twenty20 tournament in Bangalore on Thursday, reports PTI. Praveen (3/18) notched up the seventh hat-trick in the tournament's history, while skipper Anil Kumble and Jacques Kallis (2/20) ably supported him from the other end to restrict the Rajasthan side under the three figure mark.

Royals batting came a cropper on Thursday as after Yusuf and Martyn, only two other batsmen -- Naman Ojha (16 off 18) and Michael Lumb (10 off 18) -- could only manage double figures. Brought back into the attack in the 17th over, Praveen first bowled Martyn of the second delivery of his third over, had Sumit Narwal brilliantly caught at square leg by Manish Pandey and then castled Paras Dogra of the next ball to the delight of the capacity c
