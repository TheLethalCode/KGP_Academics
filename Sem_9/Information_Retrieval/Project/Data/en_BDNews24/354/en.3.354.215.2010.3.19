<TEXT>
 BERNE, March 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Unfashionable Premier League side Fulham knocked favourites Juventus out of the Europa League after an astonishing 4-1 win over the Italians who finished the last 16 second leg game with nine men on Thursday. Italy's 2006 World Cup-winning captain Fabio Cannavaro was sent off after less than half an hour for the twice European champions and three-times UEFA Cup winners, who went out despite a 3-1 first-leg lead and second minute goal at Craven Cottage. In another drama-filled match, prolific World Cup-bound Spain striker David Villa scored a hat-trick for Valencia as they drew 4-4 at Werder Bremen to go through on away goals. Benfica scored twice in the last 15 minutes to win 2-1 at Olympique Marseille and also qualify for the quarter-finals. It was the second time this season Juve have gone out of European competition with a 4-1 defeat after they lost at home to Bayern Munich in their final Champions League group match by the same score. They got the perfect start at Craven Cottage thanks to David Trezeguet's early opener but Bobby Zamora equalised seven minutes later and then Cannavaro was harshly dismissed in the 27th minute for bringing down Zoltan Gera. Gera finished off a flowing move in the 39th minute and then converted a penalty four minutes intot he second half after Diego handled to level the aggregate score. BRILLIAMT CHIP A brilliant chip by Fulham's United States midfielder Clint Dempsey seven minutes from time sent the west London side into their first European quarter-final with a 5-4 aggregate win. "It was a fantastic team performance. Their goalkeeper made four outstanding saves," Fulham manager Roy Hodgson told ESPN. "Beating Juve is something special. I'm sure every one of them (Fulham fans) will remember this night for some time to come." Valencia, held 1-1 at home by Bremen, were ahead on aggregate from the moment Villa gave them a second minute lead in a pulsating game. Juan Mata extended Valencia's advantage in the 15th minute but Hugo Almeida pulled one back for the Germans who looked capable of forcing an equaliser only for Villa to score again on the stroke of halftime. Bremen, who had 27 shots on target, seemed capable of a remarkable comeback as Torsten Frings, with a penalty, and Marko Marin scored twice in five minutes to make it 3-3 with nearly half an hour still to play. However, Valencia broke down the other end four minutes later and Villa struck with another clinical finish. It was still not over as Bremen's Peru forward Claudio Pizarro levelled with six minutes to play but the Spaniards held on for a 5-5 aggregate draw and a palce in the last eight. Benfica, held 1-1 at home by Olympique Marseille in the first leg, were in more trouble when the French side's Senegal forward Mamadou Niang volleyed home from close range in the 70th minute. But the Portuguese team created more chances and deservedly levelled four minutes later when Argentine Maxi Pereira exploited a blunder by the Marseille defence to score with a low drive from just outside the box. There was a lot of confusion after Brazilian Alan Kardec scored the winner for Benfica with an angled shot inside the area from a Pablo Aimar free kick. The scorer was yellow-carded for taking off his shirt in celebration and Marseille winger Hatem Ben Arfa, who had only just come on, was then sent off for kicking Javi Garcia. In the other early kickoff, Dieudonne Mbokani gave Standard Liege a 1-0 win over Panathinaikos as the Belgian side completed a 4-1 aggregate victory over the Gr
