 BARCELONA, March 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona's objective is to try and match Manchester United's recent consistency in the Champions League, coach Pep Guardiola said on Tuesday. Defending the European Cup has proved a difficult task for holders over the last few years, and the 2009 winners go into Wednesday's Champions League last-16 home second leg against VfB Stuttgart with their tie finely balanced at 1-1.
