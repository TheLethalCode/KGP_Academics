<TITLE> India to get access to David Headley on Mumbai attack - US </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Mar 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian investigators will be given access to David Headley who pleaded guilty to helping plan the Mumbai attacks, but he won't be extradited to India on current charges, a US official said on Saturday. New Delhi wants to interrogate Headley, who this week admitted to a US court to scouting targets for the 2008 rampage on India's financial hub, which killed 166 people and derailed peace dialogue between India and Pakistan.

Headley is also charged with plotting a revenge attack on a Danish newspaper that published cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed in 2005. India's Home Minister has said India still had "many more questions" about the Chicago man, who spent his childhood in Pakistan, and would not withdraw a request for extradition.

Blake also said it was very important for Pakistan to tackle the threat of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), the Pakistan-based militant outfit whom India blames for Mumbai and whom Headley pleaded guilty to supporting.
