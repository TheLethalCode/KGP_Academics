 Dhaka, Mar 18 (bdnews24.com)  Food and disaster minister Abdur Razzak strongly denied claims made by international NGOs that Bangladesh has been ill-treating Rohingya immigrants in Bangladesh. "The international media is publishing false information, and some non governmental organisations (NGOs) are abetting them," Razzak told reporters on Thursday after a meeting with United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR Bangladesh chief Craig Sander at his office. He said that "the government is trying to identify the NGOs involved and has asked the NGO Bureau to investigate and take action". However, Mohammad Ibrahim, information officer of the bureau, told bdnew24 they the bureau has not yet received such a request. The minister was speaking following recent reports that many Rohingya Muslims were crossing the porous border into Bangladesh ahead of elections in Myanmar. Apart from alleged persecution, shrinking economic scope in Myanmar is also pushing Rohingyas to flee to Bangladesh, experts say. Razzak said that the UNHCR is putting pressure on the Bangladesh authorities to register the undocumented Rohingyas. Whilst there are estimated to be between 200,000 to 400,000 Rohingyas in Bangladesh, only about 25,000 are recognized by Bangladesh as "refugees" - living in the Kutupalong and Naya Para camps in Cox's Bazar where they receive shelter and rations. The remaining population are officially termed "undocumented Rohingyas" and live in nearby slums. The minister said that if the government were to register more Rohingyas, it would encourage a fresh influx from Myanmur, putting further pressure on Bangladesh. Arjun Jain, UNHCR's Senior Protection Officer told bdnews24 that he understood the government's reluctance to take steps that might create a "massive pull factor" attracting more Rohingyas into Bangladesh. But he added that UNHCR still wanted to find ways to document the tens of thousands of Rohingya's outside the comps to find out, "who they are, what they are doing, and why they came here." He said that UNHCR could not comment on NGO allegations about government ill treatment of Rohingya as it has no access to the border areas and the Rohingya population outside the camps. "If the allegations were found to be true, they would be of course be of concern - but the Bangladesh government had repeatedly committed itself to a process of voluntary repatriation.", he added The Minister also told journalists that he was not sure whether the Myanmur government could be trusted. "Myanmar has agreed to take them back. But we are not convinced by this pledge," he added. Razzak explained that the government has recently restricted Rohingyas to their camps due to the limited job opportunities in the area. "The Rohingyas in the refugee camps are able to get work whilst people of our own can't," Razzak said. bdn
