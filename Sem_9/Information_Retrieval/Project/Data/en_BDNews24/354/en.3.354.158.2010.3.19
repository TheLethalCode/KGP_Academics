 Moulvibazar, Mar 19 (bdnews24.com)  At least 11 policemen were injured in a clash with BNP activists in Moulavibazar on Friday. Police had to baton-charge and fire teargas to disperse the BNP activists, who attacked the police, Kamalganj police sub inspector Saiful Islam said. BNP's central committee member Haji Mujib, his brother Shamim Ahmed Chowdhury, also the local Upazila chairman, and four others were arrested in connection with the attack, Islam said. Kamalganj police chief Nazim Uddin, sub inspectors Saiful Islam, Badrul Alam, Syed Mahbubur Rahman and seven others were injured. The injured were released after treatment, the Upazila health centre's duty doctor AKM Shamsuddin said. Shamim Ahmed Chowdhury, the Upazila chairman, was released on bail earlier Friday in a money laundering case, SI Saiful Islam said. Islam said severe traffic congestion resulted at Kamalganj when Chowdhury's brother Haji Mujib arrived in the Upazila with his motorcade at around 6pm on Friday. "Police asked him and his men to leave his vehicles and progress on foot." "Mujib's entourage and local BNP supporters got involved in heated arguments with the police at one stage and started a demonstration consisting of 700-800 activists." "At this point, they threw brickbats at police," Islam said. "Police had to charge with batons and fire tear gas shells to disperse the activists." Additional police super Shyamal Kumar Nath told bdnews24.com he had visited the scene immediately after the incident. "Police are preparing to press charges," he said. bdn
