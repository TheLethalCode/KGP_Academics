<TEXT>
 bdnews24.com New Delhi correspondent New Delhi, March 19 (bdnews24.com)  India is contemplating a unilateral 'no-firing' policy along its border with Bangladesh for one year in order to protect innocent civilian lives. The proposal comes against a backdrop of recent border shootings by India's Border Security Force in which Bangladeshis have been killed or injured. Indian home secretary GK Pillai, at a joint security conference in the Indian capital on Friday, said that New Delhi was considering the proposal of "unilateral no firing on the border for a year". The modalities of the move were being worked out, he added. Pillai said that India's move was intended to address Bangladesh's concern over deaths of civilians due to firing along the border between the two countries. He added that India was well aware of the fact that death of innocent citizens in cross-fire was a very sensitive issue in the neighbouring country. The Indian home secretary was delivering the inaugural lecture at the India-Bangladesh Security Conference jointly organised by the Observer Research Foundation and the Bangladesh Enterprise Institute in New Delhi. Pillai did not clarify if the declaration of no-firing would mean a blanket order to India's Border Security Force personnel against opening fire along the border with Bangladesh. The home secretary also suggested expediting the bilateral process in order to resolve border disputes between the two countries by the end of this year or early next year. 'DIPLOMATIC MEASURES' Bangladesh's home minister Sahara Khatun told parliament just days before that the government was addressing the killing of innocent Bangladeshis by India's Border Security Force. Replying to a question, she had said "diplomatic initiatives" were on to reach a permanent solution. She mentioned that 14 Bangladeshis had been killed by BSF firing in 2010 so far. "The government has been trying its utmost to resolve the problem. We want a permanent solution," the minister said. Sahara also said prime minister Sheikh Hasina during her Delhi trip in January discussed border shootings and deaths by BSF with her Indian counterpart, seeking a halt to loss of civilian lives. Director general-level talks also just concluded between the two border forces in New Delhi on March 11 with both sides vowing greater cooperation. BSF gave full assurances to exercise restraint aimed at preventing loss of innocent lives on the shared borders. bdn
