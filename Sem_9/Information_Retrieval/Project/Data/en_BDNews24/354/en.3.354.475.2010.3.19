 JAKARTA, Mar 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indonesia understands the reason for US President Barack Obama's last-minute cancellation of his visit to Jakarta and Bali, officials in the Southeast Asian nation said on Friday. But ordinary Indonesians expressed disappointment that Obama would not be returning to the place where he lived as a child. Obama scrapped his plan to visit Indonesia and Australia on Thursday, days before the start of his Asia-Pacific trip, in order to stay in Washington and give a final push for a US healthcare overhaul. The visit will be postponed until June. "Of course we have made maximum preparations ahead of the visit, but that does not mean we should be disappointed by the delay," presidential spokesman Julian Pasha told Reuters. "The delay of President Obama's visit to Indonesia is related to urgent internal matters, so we understand. Health reform has become a hot issue in the US" The rare cancellation of a presidential trip abroad underscored how Obama's political challenges at home have begun complicating his activity overseas, stirring debate on whether he may have to scale back some foreign policy goals. Obama had intended to use the March 21-26 trip, his first foreign travel this year, to deepen U.S. ties in the Asia-Pacific region in the face of rising Chinese influence. Obama's first stop was to have been in the US territory of Guam, a hub of American military power in the Pacific, to underline Washington's security commitment in the region. Then he was headed to Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, where he spent four years as a child and where he was to try to build on his outreach to Muslim world. After that, he was to have visited Australia, a linchpin US friend in the Pacific and key military ally in Afghanistan. FORMER SCHOOL Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa said that it would better for Obama to visit when the domestic setting for him was more settled. "We dont want him to be in Jakarta when his mind is elsewhere," Natalegawa told a media briefing. The minister said that Jakarta would consult with Washington over whether several agreements, including one on a comprehensive partnership, would be signed now or delayed until June. Indonesian officials had also hoped that Obama's visit would help boost US investment in Southeast Asia's biggest economy. Obama is generally popular in Indonesia given his early ties to the country and there was disappointment over the delay. "Of course I am disappointed but if he hasn't cancelled it, if he is just delaying it, then I am happy. As long as he is still coming," said 9-year-old Rizki Rivaldi Riadi, who attends the school Obama went to in the smart Menteng neighbourhood. Obama had already put off his departure by three days before the cancellation, leaving Indonesian officials scrambling to re-organise his itinerary. Firi, a mother of one of the students at Menteng 01 state primary school, said the children had been hoping for a visit by the school's former pupil. "It is sad, because the kids had hoped that he would come, they have prepared everything to welcome him," said Firi. Harry Silalahi, a political analyst at the Centre for Strategic and International studies in Jakarta, said expectations in Indonesia had been too high for the trip. "People have been overly sentimental and nostalgic about his visit," said Silal
