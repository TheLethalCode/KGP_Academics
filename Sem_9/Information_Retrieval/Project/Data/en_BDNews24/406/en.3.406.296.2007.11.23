<TITLE> Taslima Nasreen packed off to New Delhi from Kolkata </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 By Sumon K Chakrabarti New Delhi, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com)  Controversial writer Taslima Nasreen has been shifted to an undisclosed location in New Delhi Friday morning after being moved secretly from Kolkata to Jaipur Thursday night. The move comes after the Indian army was called out on the streets of Kolkata Wednesday when activists of a Muslim forum enforced road blocks across Kolkata and clashed with the police demanding immediate deportation of Taslima from India. Initially, the Rajasthan government had said it was not informed about Taslima being flown to Jaipur from Kolkata. Reports suggest she is now being shunted out of Jaipur because the Rajasthan government had not been approached for prior permission. Sources in the Rajasthan government, however, told bdnews24.com that Taslima was on a ''personal visit'' and they had no prior information that she was coming. But Rajasthan inspector general (Security) Meghchand Meena said Taslima was provided 'Y' grade security by the Rajasthan authorities on the requests of their West Bengal counterparts. She was reportedly turned away by several hotels who claimed they were full up until she had found a room in Hotel Shikha near the Civil Secretariat. The author was staying in room number 101. The police sealed its entrance and threw a security cordon around it. Traffic was also diverted in the area. The hotel management, meanwhile, refused to divulge anything about the author's stay but reports say a man called Faizal Khan had accompanied her to the Pink City. The scenes of violence on Kolkata's main streets broadcast across the country Wednesday rattled the communist government in West Bengal. One of the main targets of the mob's fury was Taslima, whose visa had been extended by the state government for six more months. Taking no chances with further fuelling the fury and clearly buckling under the pressure from Muslim fundamentalist organisations, the West Bengal government Thursday had quietly moved Taslima out of the state. So secret was the move that Rajasthan police was not informed until her flight landed in Jaipur. The West Bengal government obviously was not willing to take any risk after violent Wednesday and there were enough signs that the Thursday calm in Kolkata could be broken Friday. Taslima angered conservative Muslims with her writings and fled Bangladesh in 1994 after radical Muslims demanded her execution. She has been living in exile for the last 13 years after a fatwa was issued against her in Bangladesh for her writings criticising Islam. In March, a Muslim group in India's Uttar Pradesh state offered a bounty for Nasreen's execution. It was followed by a physical attack on the author by Muslim activists in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad in August. bd
