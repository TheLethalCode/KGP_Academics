<TITLE> Tevez sees red in Argentina loss </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Bogota, Nov 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)- Argentina lost their unbeaten record in 2010 World Cup qualifiers with a 2-1 loss away to Colombia, with forward Carlos Tevez sent off after just 25 minutes. Lionel Messi gave Argentina a first-half lead with an individual goal but Colombia hit back after the break with a Ruben Dario Bustos free kick and an 83rd minute winner from substitute Dayro Moreno. Both Colombian scorers were booked for taking their shirts off to celebrate the goals. Argentina, who now have nine points from four games while Colombia, who are unbeaten, have eight, noticeably tired in the second half of a game played at 2,600 metres above sea level. Neither side created a serious chance before Manchester United's Tevez was sent off for petulantly kicking Bustos in an off-the-ball incident, referee Jorge Larrionda producing the red card after being alerted by the linesman. The dismissal galvanised Argentina more than Colombia and the visitors went ahead 12 minutes later. Juan Roman Riquelme took a quick free kick on the left and found Messi, who slipped past three defenders and flicked the ball beyond Agustin Julio into the far corner. Hugo Ibarra and Riquelme both missed chances to add to their score as Argentina controlled the ball for the rest of the first half, while Messi was close to a second in the 51st minute when he broke down the right, cut inside his marker but shot wide. Colombia, however, were beginning to threaten and equalised in the 62nd minute when Bustos - who also scored from a free kick in Saturday's 1-0 win over Venezuela - chipped a free kick between Roberto Abbondanzieri and the near post. With the visitors noticeably tiring, Macnelly Torres split the Argentine defence and found Moreno who slipped the ball to Wason Renteria, whose shot appeared to be going in before Moreno rushed in to make sure with seven minutes remaining
