<TITLE> Danish Muslims convicted in bomb plot trial </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 COPENHAGEN, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Three Danish Muslim men were convicted of planning a bomb attack in Denmark by a jury in a Copenhagen court on Friday. A fourth man was acquitted. The four were among nine arrested last year in Odense, in central Denmark, for collecting bomb-making materials. They were charged under anti-terrorism laws, while the rest have been released and will not face trial. If the verdict is upheld by a three-judge court, the men face up to life in prison, a sentence rarely imposed in Denmark. The men were accused of planning to bomb the Copenhagen City Hall Square or the Tivoli amusement park to protest against cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad that were published in a Danish newspaper in 2005 and the presence of Danish soldiers in Iraq. Prosecutors produced analyses of chemicals found at the men's homes last year as well as surveillance evidence, wire taps and manuals for bomb making found on the suspects' computers. Prosecutors also presented testimony from an informer who infiltrated the group and reported on their activities to Denmark's Security Intelligence Service.
