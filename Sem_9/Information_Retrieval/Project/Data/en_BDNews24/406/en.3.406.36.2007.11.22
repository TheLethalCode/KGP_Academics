 Dhaka, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court Thursday ended a hearing on twin appeals of the government and the Anticorruption Commission against the High Court bail to Sheikh Hasina in Bangabandhu Memorial Trust graft case. The court will deliver the verdict Monday. A full bench of seven judges headed by chief justice Md Ruhul Amin set the date after hearing both sides. Advocate Habibul Islam Bhuiyan, attorney for the ACC, said: "The ACC filed the case legally. It was right to include the case in emergency powers rules. Although Sheikh Hasina is a former prime minister, she is not above law." On the other hand, Hasina's lawyer barrister Rafique-ul-Huq said: "It was totally illegal to include the case in the emergency powers rules. The law clearly says when it should be applied." The ACC filed the case with Tejgaon Police Station against seven people including the Awami League chief on Sept 2 for allegedly approving a deal to install three power plants in return for bribes. The money was later spent on Bangabandhu Memorial Trust, according to case details. The HC granted bail to Hasina in the case on Nov 4 and put freezes on the running of the case under the emergency powers rules after Hasina filed a writ petition on Oct 28. On Nov 8, the government filed a counter-appeal with the Appellate Division seeking a stay order on the HC bail. The government took the case under the emergency powers rules on Sept 20. bdnews24.com
