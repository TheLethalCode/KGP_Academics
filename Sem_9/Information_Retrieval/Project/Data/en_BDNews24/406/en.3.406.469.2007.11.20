<TITLE> Lebanon delays president vote, tightens security </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIRUT, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Deeply divided Lebanese leaders postponed a presidential election until Friday to allow more time to agree a successor to the pro-Syrian incumbent, whose term expires that day. The delay intensifies a political crisis that could result in two rival administrations and violence in a country still rebuilding from its 1975-1990 civil war. The army boosted security on Tuesday and warned against internal strife. Parliament had been due to convene on Wednesday to elect the successor to President Emile Lahoud but a senior political source told Reuters the vote would be delayed, the fourth postponement since September. A French government spokeswoman confirmed the postponement. "They cannot reach agreement. Discussions are continuing," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Pascale Andreani said in Paris. Paris has been leading mediation efforts to push the rival leaders towards a deal on the presidency, the latest front in a year-long power struggle between factions opposed to Syrian influence in Lebanon and others supported by Damascus. Hundreds of soldiers manned roadblocks and deployed armoured vehicles around government buildings in Beirut, a senior security source said. "The army has started security arrangements," he said. Army chief General Michel Suleiman said: "Any attack on security is national treason and any weapon directed internally is a treacherous weapon." The army should pay no attention to arguments "which have almost split the country into scattered parts", Suleiman said in a statement to soldiers to mark Independence Day, which falls on Thursday. The army is one of the few state institutions that has continued to function effectively during the political conflict between the Western-backed governing coalition and the opposition led by Hezbollah and backed by Syria and Iran. RIVAL CANDIDATES Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a key opposition figure, and majority leader Saad al-Hariri have failed to agree on any of the names for president proposed by the head of the Maronite church. Hariri left for a trip to Moscow early on Tuesday. The head of state must be a Maronite, according to the Lebanon's sectarian power-sharing system. Political sources say the governing coalition wants MP Robert Ghanem for the post while the opposition supports former minister Michel Edde. France, which backs the governing coalition, said on Monday its mediation efforts were being thwarted. Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner continued his talks in Beirut on Tuesday. Speaking in Tehran, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said Syria and France were working towards the same goal, Iran's official IRNA news agency reported. Hezbollah, a powerful member of the opposition, warned of a "catastrophic picture" without a deal. "Constitutional life would be gone with the wind," Mohammed Raad, leader of the group's parliamentary bloc, told al-Manar TV on Monday. Agreement on the presidency is needed to guarantee a two-thirds quorum for the vote in parliament, where the governing coalition holds an absolute majority of three. Some members of the ruling coalition say it may call its lawmakers to elect a president if there is no deal. The opposition has said such a move would be unconstitutional. The president has previously suggested he could hand his powers to army chief Suleiman -- a step that the anti-Syrian majority faction would reject as unconstitution
