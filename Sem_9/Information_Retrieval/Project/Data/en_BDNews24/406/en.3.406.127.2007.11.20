 Dhaka, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed has launched a passionate appeal to businessmen to help the cyclone survivors to the "best of their ability". "We are now facing a national disaster," he said in a televised address to the nation Tuesday. "I urge the businessmen to keep prices of essential commodities under control by showing their social responsibility and sensitivity." "To face it effectively, I hope, peopleregardless of party leanings and opinionswill come forward to stand by the cyclone victims." "The nation is facing a deadly, unprecedented situation in the wake of cyclone Sidr. "I have seen unimaginable destruction in the affected areas, visiting there more than once." "I have listened to the destitute," the chief adviser said. Fakhruddin asked people of all walks of life to come forward and stand by those affected by the cyclone. He said about 40,000 people had been affected by the cyclone. "Several thousands of them are dead. The figure is rising gradually and the number of the injured is enormous," the interim government head said. "It is very difficult to count the missing." "The number of totally or partially destroyed houses is about nine lakh." "Although the severity of the cyclone was greater than the 1991 cyclone, the casualty figure was far less thanks to preparedness," Fakhruddin said. "But we should not be complacent. We have to find ways to limit damage and casualties from future natural disasters." The chief adviser said the armed forces launched rescue and relief operations in disaster zones and private organisations, aid agencies and other NGOs combined forces with them. "We are grateful to all of them." The government has already built a framework to manage relief funds and materials and rush them to distressed people, he said. "So it will be more effective to channel any funds and other aid through the government." Fakhruddin suspended his planned visit to Uganda to join the 2007 Commonwealth Summit slated for Nov 23-25. bd
