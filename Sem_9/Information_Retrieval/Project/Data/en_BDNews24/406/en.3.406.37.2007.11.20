<TITLE> Chittagong, Khulna on course to win </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong and Khulna were within striking distance Tuesday of winning their four-day National Cricket League ties against Sylhet and Barisal at the close of third day. Chittagong need 159 runs on the final day with all wickets intact after Sylhet, forced to follow on, were all out for 339 in the second innings at Bir Shrestha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium. Away at Shaheed Chandu Stadium, hosts Barisal still need another 57 runs to avert an innings defeat to Khulna having made 133 for six at stumps after following on. The match between Rajshahi and Dhaka apparently were heading for a draw unless no miracle happened on the final day at Rajshahi Divisional Stadium. Rajshahi, who posted 298 all out in the first innings, made 299 for nine at stumps in the second innings to take an overall 322-run lead after Dhaka declared their first innings on 205 for nine. Chittagong vs Sylhet Sylhet bounced back in the second innings riding on a superb century from Golam Mabud, who had hit a ton in the last round one-day game against Barisal. Mabud converted his overnight three to 110 off 199 balls with the help of 11 fours and two sixes but his partner Alok Kapali fell on 36. Wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim (43), Nabil Samad (33), Enamul Haq Junior (25) and Rashedul Islam (22 not out) helped Sylhet cross 300-mark after the visitors resumed their innings on 76 for four on the third day. Despite the superb performance from the middle and the tail, a 158-run lead may prove not enough to defend for Sylhet, whose bowlers have to bowl out of their skin to deny Chittagong their maiden triumph. Khulna vs Barisal Left-arm spinner Murad Khan snared seven wickets as Khulna enforced follow-on on Barisal after bowling them out for 206 in the first innings. Khulna declared their first innings on 396 for nine. Barisal, having resumed on 159 for five, needed 87 runs to avert the follow-on but managed only 46 runs losing the last five wickets as Murad emulated pacer Dollar Mahmud, who had also snared seven wickets in the previous round. Murad conceded one run more than his teammate Dollar, who had given away 52 runs against Rajshahi. Barisal finished the third day on 133 for six as Syed Rasel (2/20) and Murad (2/30) ripped through the top order. Raisul Islam was not out on 24. Dhaka vs Rajshahi Dhaka captain Mohammad Ashraful deprived Rajshahi of one bonus point after declaring the first innings on overnight score of 205 for nine, giving the hosts a 93-run first innings lead. Rajshahi, who scored 298 all out in the first innings, were 229 for nine at stumps in the second innings with Farhad Reza batting on 98. Rajshahi is highly likely to declare their innings immediately after Farhad reaches his ton to set Dhaka to chase over 300 runs on the final day. Dhaka will have odds heavily stacked against them since no team has successfully chased over 300 runs on the final day in the ongoing league. b
