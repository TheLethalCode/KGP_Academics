 MOGADISHU, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The number of Somalis uprooted by fighting in their own country has hit a `staggering' one million, the United Nations' refugee agency said on Tuesday. UNHCR said 600,000 people were believed to have fled Somalia's lawless capital Mogadishu since February, when clashes pitting allied Somali-Ethiopian troops against suspected Islamist insurgents started to escalate.
