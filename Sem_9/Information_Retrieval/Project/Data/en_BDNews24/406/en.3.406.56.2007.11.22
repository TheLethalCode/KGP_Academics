 DHAKA, Nov 21 (bdnews24.com) Mohammad Ali of Rangabali upazila in Patuakhali survived Sidr by a sheer will to live, and a lot of luck. bdnews24.com correspondent Sanjay Dey met Ali, 80, at Charmontaz market, 40km off Galachipa Sadar. Ali, a homeless man, is known to his neighbours and friends as Ali Bhai. As is his habit every year, he was roaming the remote coastal areas during the harvest season. Two days before Sidr, he went to Charkalgachhia together with his wife and two sons to harvest the paddy. "We collected six bags of paddy Wednesday and Thursday. We sold half a bag before midday Thursday. Then I sent my son and his wife to Rangabali market to go shopping with the cash we'd made." "In the afternoon, we could feel the wind rising. I fastened the paddy bags tight and tried to return to Rangabali." Ali Bhai wanted to reach Rangabali by trawler before evening set in. But he couldn't because the vessel was full. He then looked for shelter from the storm. "I could not find a place to safely ride out the storm." "Finally, I settled on a large tree. I climbed the tree and braced myself for the storm by tying myself to it with a sari my wife had left behind." "I thought I would die, but at the very least I wanted people to find my dead body on land." Hurricane winds increased after 9:00 pm Thursday. By 10:30 pm the whole area was engulfed in a tidal surge, he recalled. Several hundred died in the surge at Kalagachhia. Many were still missing. "The angry sea snatched young lives away before my very eyes. Many who had sought refuge in the trees fell into the dark waters below. I saw it all," Ali said. Ali spent the night in his treetop refuge, and alighted from it late the next morning, alive. In the surrounding areas, the wounded and bereft retell Ali's tale. In a place where nature has visited death on the young and strong, one old man's story of survival is giving people something to believe in. bdnews24.com/sn
