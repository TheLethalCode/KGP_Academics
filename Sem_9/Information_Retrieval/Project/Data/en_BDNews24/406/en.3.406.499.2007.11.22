South Africa's captain added that Shaun Pollock, their leading wicket-taker who sat out the two tests against New Zealand, will be in in the starting XI. South Africa have made just one change to the squad that won a limited-overs series in Pakistan last month, with the hero of the test series against the Kiwis, fast bowler Dale Steyn, coming in for batsman Justin Kemp.
