 SINGAPORE, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks fell for the sixth straight session on Thursday, but came off multi-month lows as the dollar rallied from record lows and with oil prices retreating from an all-time high near $100 a barrel. European shares are seen opening higher, with investors looking forward to a break from a steady stream of bearish US economic news -- even if only because US markets are closed for the Thanksgiving holiday. Bookmakers expect Britain's FTSE 100 to open up 18 to 22 points, the German DAX up 11 to 15 points and the French CAC 40 3 to 17 points higher. The latest news from the United States was a fall in consumer sentiment in November to the lowest in two years and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson telling the Wall Street Journal he expected mortgage defaults to rise next year, heightening concerns about bank profits. "The financial institutions haven't come clean -- that's the bottom line," said Eric Betts, equities strategist at Nomura Australia. "It is probably because they don't know what their losses are and that has got to be a concern." U.S. crude steadied at $97.42 a barrel, coming off a record high just shy of $100 on Wednesday as weekly inventory data showed a build in stocks at the delivery point for U.S. futures. "The oil market looks quite a risky place at the moment as these prices will inevitably have an impact on demand," strategist Peter Richardson at Craton Capital said. DOLLAR STRUGGLES The economic concerns drove the dollar to record low of $1.4872 against the euro on expectations of further interest rate cuts, although it recovered to $1.4851 at 0642 GMT. The dollar was at 108.85 yen off a 2- year high of 108.25 yen hit the previous day. Investors headed for safe havens, sending 10-year Japanese government bond yields down 3.5 basis points to their lowest in more than two years and gold edging above $800 an ounce. Tokyo's Nikkei ended up 0.3 percent, paring losses from a 16-month low, while MSCI's index of other Asian shares lost 0.6 percent, stretching its losses for the month to 13 percent. The Asia-Pacific index is on track for its worst monthly fall since plunging 16.7 percent in September 2001. A weaker dollar dents the profits of Asia's exporters, and Japan's are really feeling the pinch. "The Japanese market faces double trouble: the impact of the Wall Street fall, and the yen's gains," said Yutaka Miura, senior technical analyst at Shinko Securities. Electronic equipment maker TDK dropped 1 percent and Honda Motor lost 1.4 percent. Hong Kong and Shanghai led the declines, falling 2.1 percent and 4.4 percent respectively. Australia's S&P ASX 200 dropped 0.8 percent, while Korea's KOSPI was down 0.4 percent. Industrial metals are also suffering from fears that weaker economic growth will cut demand, with benchmark copper nearly a quarter off a high of $8,315 in early October. BHP Billiton, the world's largest miner, dropped 1.5 percent, while Korea Zinc fell 5.9 percent after zinc prices lost 6 percent overnig
