<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com) Rajshahi extended their lead Thursday at the top of the one-day table while Barisal tasted maiden victory and Sylhet fetched second win in National Cricket League. An unbeaten 73 from Nayeem Islam powered Rajshahi to a 21-run win over Dhaka at Rajshahi Divisional Stadium. Imran Hossain stroked a superb 99 to help Barisal get better of Khulna by four wickets at Shaheed Chandu Stadium. An all-round show from former national cricketer Tapash Kumar Baishya powered Sylhet to a 25-run win over Chittagong at Bir Shrestha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium. Rajshahi top the table with 10 points, four points clear of Khulna after the fifth round. Sylhet joined Dhaka and Chittagong in the third position with four points. Barisal opened their account with two points after conceding four defeats in a row. Rajshahi vs Dhaka Rajshahi bowled Dhaka out for 203 in 47.3 overs after making a moderate 224 for eight in 50 overs. Opener Zunaed Siddique (59) and middle order Nayeem Islam (73 not out) helped the last year's runners-up cross the 200 mark after they had lost opener Jahurul Islam (4), Farhad Hossain (18), Farhad Reza (3), Mushfiqur Rahim (0) and Khaled Mashud (2) cheaply. Spinner Mosharraf Hossain Rubel and pacer Mohammad Sharif tore through the Rajshahi batting with three wickets each. In reply, Dhaka fell in deep trouble losing Javed Omar (9), Al Shariar Rokon (11) and Mehrab Hossain Junior (7). And although Rubel (37), Mohammad Ashraful (55) and Mahmudullah Riad (22) took their side near the target, the tailenders failed to cash in and Dhaka were 21 runs shy of the target. Farhad Hossain (3/18), Shafaq Al Zabir (2/34), Golam Mahbub (2/35) and Saqlain Sajib (2/42) put brakes on Dhaka innings. Barisal vs Khulna Barisal raced to 243 for six in 49.1 overs chasing Khulna's 240 all out in 49.2 overs. Put in to bat first, Khulna posted the challenging total thanks to a fine start from openers Nazmus Sadat (30) and Imrul Kayes (55). Habibul Bashar (33), Saqib Al Hasan (25) and Tushar Imran (39) helped their side to a defendable score. However, despite initial hiccups, Barisal reached home and dry as opener Hannan Sarkar hammered 70 and Imran Ahmed smashed an unbeaten 99. Sylhet vs Chittagong Sylhet made a modest 210 all out in 49.2 overs after deciding to bat first. With top and middle-order batsmen found wanting, tail ender Sharifullah (46) and Tapash (50) took the visitors out of woods. Tareq Aziz (3/46), Aftab Ahmed (2/18) and Kamrul Islam (2/56) bowled outstandingly well for Chittagong. The hosts fell 25 runs short in their chase in the face of superb bowling efforts from Enamul Hossain Junior (3/23), Imtiaz Hossain (2/25) and Rashedul Islam (2/36). Ehsanul Haq topscored with an unbeaten 39, followed by Dhiman Ghosh (37 not out), Nazimuddin (36) and Aftab Ahmed (32). bdn
