 DHAKA, Nov 21 (bdnews24.com) - Dhaka captain Mohammad Ashraful has been fined 30 percent of his match fees for a breach of the code of conduct during the third day (Tuesday) of the National League League's four-dayer between Rajshahi and Dhaka, a Bangladesh Cricket Board press release said Wednesday. Dhaka pacer Mahbubul Alam was given a warning by match referee ASM Roqibul Hassan. Ashraful and Alam had appealed for a catch behind the wicket after Rajshahi batsman Farhad Reza was called not out, but Ashraful requested the umpire to consult the leg umpire about the decision, at Rajshahi Divisional Stadium. Both players later admitted to the hearing bench conducted by the match referee Wednesday that they had violated the code of conduct.
