 Dhaka, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Police Tuesday launched Gender Guidelines in an effort to make law-enforcers more sensitive to women's rights. Local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal, a former police chief, launched the guidelines Tuesday at a hotel in the city and said: "The preparation and launch of the first-ever gender guidelines for police in Bangladesh ... is a very significant milestone." "Gender discrimination is at every level of society. Adhering to these guidelines would change things. It is expected to change the police's attitude towards women and children and also enable them to act more sensitively." Iqbal later told reporters that the guidelines were meant to ensure women get the same facilities at police stations as men. He added that a committee would be formed to monitor the implementation of the guidelines. Asked whether separate police stations for women were needed, the adviser said, "If separate units for women could be gradually set up at all police stations, it's not necessary." Home secretary Abdul Karim, former inspector general of police ASM Shahjahan, additional inspector general of police Naba Bikram Kishore Tripura, also project director of UNDP-aided Police Reform Programme (PRP), programme manager Hubert Staberhofer and PRP gender specialist Fowzia Khandaker Eva were also present. Shahjahan stressed implementation of the guidelines through a monitoring committee. "There are lots of laws on different issues in this country. But they are not implemented. That's why it's important to monitor the implementation of the Gender Guidelines," he said. Tripura briefed on the objectives of the guidelines which, among other things, say model police stations would ensure right to protection by law without discrimination, build women and children-friendly surroundings and prevent their suppression and quicken the service delivery to women. bdnews24.com
