 YANGON, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Myanmar's detained opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi was taken on Monday from her villa to a state guesthouse where she is believed to have met the ruling junta's liaison minister, opposition sources and witnesses said. Witnesses said a government car with tinted windows left Suu Kyi's tightly guarded lakeside villa in the main city of Yangon and returned about one hour later.

Junta leader Than Shwe, who is believed to personally loathe the Nobel laureate, has offered direct negotiations if she agrees to certain preconditions, including dropping her support for sanctions. However, his comments reported by state media on Saturday that the only path to political reform is via the junta's own "roadmap to democracy" suggests any talks will have to take place within that framework. Western governments have dismissed the roadmap as a blue-print for the army legitimising its grip on power after 45 years of unbroken military rule. Under an outline for a new charter, the head of the army will be the most powerful person in the country, with the ability to appoint key cabinet figures and suspend the constitution in the event of an emergency that he defin
