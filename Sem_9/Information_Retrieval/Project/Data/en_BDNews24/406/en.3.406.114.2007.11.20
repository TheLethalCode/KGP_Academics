 LONDON COLNEY, England, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England captain John Terry trained with the rest of Steve McClaren's squad on Tuesday but is not expected to play against Croatia in the final Euro 2008 Group E qualifier at Wembley on Wednesday. Terry has not played since suffering a knee injury before England's 2-1 defeat by Russia in Moscow on Oct. 17. He had surgery on the knee and has missed Chelsea's last seven matches as well as England's last three games. Former captain David Beckham, who is in line to win his 99th cap on Wednesday but is not certain of a place in the starting lineup, also trained with the squad at Arsenal's training base. England need at least one point from the match to ensure they qualify for next year's finals in Austria and Switzerland. Croatia have already qualified for the 16-team tournament
