 JAIPUR, India, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan frontline batsman Mohammad Yousuf and Indian wicketkeeper Mahendra Dhoni played down injury concerns ahead of the first test starting in New Delhi on Thursday. Yousuf, who scored 74 in Pakistan's victory in the final one-dayer on Sunday, did not field when India batted. Skipper Shoaib Malik said the 33-year-old batsman had a problem with his elbow. "He went off the field because of pain in his elbow," Malik told reporters. "It is nothing major. The doctor advised him to rest for today and tomorrow and it will improve." India one-day skipper Dhoni twisted his ankle attempting a run while batting in the game which Pakistan won by 31 runs. "Nothing is broken, so it should be fine," he said. "I'm already feeling a lot better. "There is no swelling and hopefully it should be fine before the tests.
