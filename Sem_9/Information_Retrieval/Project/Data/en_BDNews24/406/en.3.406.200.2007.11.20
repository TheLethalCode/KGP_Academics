 Dhaka, November 20 (bdnews24.com)Door-to-door data gathering on voters began Tuesday in the 28 police station areas under Dhaka City Corporation, as the field enumerators employed and trained by the Election Commission started visiting homes. This initial activity is scheduled to be complete by Nov 29. From Dec 1 the next phase of photographing and registration will begin. Voters will simultaneously be provided with national IDs. DCC is set to open 951 voter registration centres in the city. EC officials inaugurated their activities in the city Tuesday morning with a visit to the Dhaka divisional commissioner's residence and supplying voter registration forms to commissioner Ekram Ahmed, wife and two sons. "This is the first time we're going to enlist ourselves as voters with photos and I think this digitised voter listing should be accurate. A flawless voter list is a must for holding a free and fair election," Ekram Ahmed told bdnews24.com. Deputy election commissioner Biswas Lutfar Rahman told bdnews24.com that they had started their work in all the DCC police stations simultaneously on the advice of Bangladesh army personnel.
