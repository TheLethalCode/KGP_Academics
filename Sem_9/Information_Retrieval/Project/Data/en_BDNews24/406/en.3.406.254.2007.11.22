 DHAKA, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com)  Mohammad Ashraful sustained an injury to his left palm during the fifth round of the National Cricket League one-dayer between Dhaka and Rajshahi at Rajshahi Divisional Stadium Thursday. Dhaka division captain Ahsraful injured his hand trying to catch Rajshahi opener Junaed Siddique's response to off-pacer Mohammad Sharif at short midwicket. Dhaka lost to Rajshahi by 21 runs in the match despite Ashraful's 55-run knock with the injury. "I thought it would not affect my batting, but it's more painful after batting," Ashraful told bdnews24.com from Rajshahi Thursday. The Bangladesh captain ruled out serious injury and hoped it would soon heal. "Though I am feeling a bit more pain now, I think it is nothing serious. An X-ray on Friday in Dhaka will clear things up," said Ashraful, who left Rajshahi Thursday night. bdn
