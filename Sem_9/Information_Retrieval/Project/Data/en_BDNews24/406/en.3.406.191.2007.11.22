 FRANKFURT, Nov 22 bdnews24.com/(Reuters) - European shares rose in choppy trade on Thursday as investors took refuge in defensive stocks such as pharmaceuticals as credit and economic worries lurked, dragging down financial and mining stocks. Markets were looking for direction with US markets closed for the Thanksgiving holiday, likely leading to thin volumes for the rest of the week. Bucking the trend in an otherwise bleak financial sector, French bank Natixisjumped more than 12 percent after its two controlling shareholders said they would buy out its bond insurer CIFG. By 1026 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 0.47 percent at 1,450.05 points in seesaw trading, having risen as much as 0.8 percent and fallen as much as 0.3 percent. The benchmark index has fallen more than 11 percent since hitting a record high in July, as a credit crisis stemming from problems in the US housing market took its toll. On Wednesday, the index recorded its worst daily slide since Aug. 16, just before the US Federal Reserve cut its lending rate for banks to unfreeze the credit markets. "Investors continue to be wary, fearing further writedowns from the US subprime crisis," one trader said, adding that many had locked in profits on Wednesday ahead of the long weekend in the United States.

The DJ Stoxx European healthcare index rose 2.1 percent as Citigroup raised the European healthcare sector to "neutral" from "underweight". Index heavyweight Novartis was up 3.3 percent, GlaxoSmithKline added 3.5 percent and Roche climbed 1.8 percent. Meanwhile the DJ Stoxx European car sector index fell 1 percent, with luxury sports car maker Porsche declining about 3 percent. Mining shares such as Xstrata, BHP Billiton and Anglo American fell as industrial metals suffered from fears that weaker economic growth will cut demand. The UK's FTSE 100 index was down 0.04 percent, Germany's DAX index fell 0.06 percent and France's CAC 40 was unchanged. The French benchmark index benefited from gains in ArcelorMittal after the world's largest steelmaker, said it was in talks to raise its stake in China Oriental Group, which could make it the first foreign firm to control a Chinese steel maker. Air France KLM rose 5.1 percent after posting better-than-expected second-quarter results. French bank Natixis surged after Banque Populaire and Caisse d'Epargne, which together control the French bank, said they would buy out Natixis's bond insurer CI
