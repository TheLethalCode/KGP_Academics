 Dhaka, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com) - Habibul Bashar has been sent to rest for a week Sunday after the top order Khulna batsman sustained an injury to his shoulder. Bashar retired hurt on 13 runs during the first day of the fifth round of the National Cricket League four-dayer against Barisal at Shaheed Chandu Stadium in Bogra. "I did not take it seriously although I felt some pain in my shoulder from the last round match against Rajshahi, but today (Sunday) I felt acute pain batting against Barisal," Bashar told bdnews24.com by phone from Bogra. An X-ray of Bashar's shoulder showed that he had sustained a minor injury. "The doctor advised me to rest for one week," said the former Bangladesh captain. At the close of the first day, Khulna were 312 for six at stumps as Tushar Imran remained unbeaten on 122. "Khulna were in very good position against Barisal after the first day," Bashar said, "Tushar will resume the second day Monday and I may bat again, but I don't think I'll be fielding." bdn
