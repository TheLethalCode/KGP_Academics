 Dhaka, November 22 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Thursday sent reformist BNP leader Ashraf Hossain to jail after he turned himself in a corruption case and ordered attachment of his assets. Ashraf surrendered before the Metropolitan Special Judge's Court at around 12:30pm facing charges of selling off a vehicle after importing it duty-free. Judge Md Azizul Haque rejected an appeal by his lawyer for bail. The court Tuesday issued an order for his arrest. The police and the joint forces seized the car on Feb 27 from Green Road Staff Quarters premises. Sub-inspector Abdul Hye of Dhanmondi Police Station filed the case on June 5, also charging former prime minister's political secretary Harris Chowdhury, Obaidul Karim of Orion Group, Harris's brother-in-law Mamun Ahmed and his driver Md Salam. The judge also ordered authorities to confiscate moveable assets of the accused after the report related to the arrest warrants issued against the accused were presented to the court. The court ordered jail authorities to provide the accused with 'division' and medical treatment, as permitted under the law. Charges were pressed in the court on Nov 13. The charge sheet said Obaidul Karim gave Harris Chowdhury a Toyota Infinity car in bribe to win his favour in getting the Gulistan-Jatrabarhi flyover construction order and other contracts. Before the car was handed over, papers for importing the car under duty-free quota for the ex-BNP whip Ashraf Hossain were prepared and Obaid paid all the expenses. Ashraf benefited financially by assisting in executing the gift deal, according to the charge sheet. It also said Harris had tried to sell off the car through his brother-in-law Mamun as soon as the caretaker government took charge. Harris's driver Salam started looking for a buyer as he was promised a Tk 5 lakh tip if he succeeded. Two of the accused, Masum and Salam, are in jail. bdnews2
