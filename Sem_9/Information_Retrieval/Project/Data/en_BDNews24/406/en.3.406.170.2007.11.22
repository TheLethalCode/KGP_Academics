<TITLE> Australian PM Howard faces final election battle </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CANBERRA, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Conservative Prime Minister John Howard, one of Australia's great political survivors, faces the fight of his life both nationally and in his own seat as he tries to retain power one final time at elections on Nov. 24. After 11 years in office, opinion polls say the government is facing near-certain defeat and Howard may lose his own Sydney seat of Bennelong to a high profile television journalist. Howard, who has a reputation as a stubborn and determined campaigner, made a final plea for support at his last major campaign speech on Thursday, pointing to his record and saying he had a coherent plan for Australia's future. "Over the last 11-and-a-half years we have been a strong, successful reformist government for Australia," Howard said. "By any measurement, Australia is a stronger, prouder and more prosperous nation than it was in March of 1996." Howard, 68, has said this election will be his last. If he wins, he will hand power to his deputy, Treasurer Peter Costello, at some point during the next three year term. Howard has defied his critics to win four consecutive elections, becoming Australia's second-longest serving prime minister along the way, behind the ruling Liberal Party's founder Sir Robert Menzies who had the job 18 years. Born in Sydney in 1939, John Winston Howard was the youngest of four brothers. His family owned a suburban petrol station and the young Howard was educated at nearby government schools. His father Lyall, who had served in World War I, died in 1955 while Howard was still at high school. The partially deaf Howard continued with his studies and won a place at Sydney University, graduating with a law degree in 1961. Friend and ally U.S. President George W. Bush called him "a man of steel" for Australia's support for the war in Iraq, but the description could equally apply to Howard's ability to brush off political setbacks. EARLY DEFEATS In 1968, Howard ran for New South Wales state parliament, but lost. In 1972, Howard helped Prime Minister William McMahon's campaign for re-election. McMahon also lost. Howard eventually won a seat in Australia's national parliament in 1974, becoming a junior minister at the age of 36 after Liberal leader Malcolm Fraser won power in December 1975. He was promoted to Treasurer in 1977 and delivered five national budgets before the Liberals lost power in 1983. Howard was elected leader of the Liberal Party in 1985, leading the then opposition party into the 1987 election. He lost and his personal poll ratings dived to a record low of 18 percent, prompting a national affairs magazine to run a front page photo of Howard with the headline: "Why on earth does this man bother?" Five months later, he was dumped from the Liberal Party's leadership, laughing off suggestions he could ever return as leader. "That would be Lazarus with a triple bypass," he said. But after his party lost two more elections, Howard was drafted back to the leadership in early 1995. He finally clinched victory in 1996 after 13 years in opposition. Describing himself as a social conservative and an economic liberal, Howard targeted policies at working families and blue-collar workers -- dubbed "the Howard battlers" -- who helped him win three more elections. In power, Howard has strengthened Australia's defence forces, been more interventionist with struggling South Pacific Island nations, and ensured Australia's military alliance with the United States is at the centre of foreign policy. Domestically, he funded a massive gun buyback scheme after a mass shooting in Tasmania, eliminated net government debt through surplus budgets, and oversaw the sale of public assets, such as phone giant Telstra Corp. Ltd. And despite the worst drought in a century, Howard has presided over a booming economy with record low unemployment and 16 years of sustained growth. The strength of Australia's economy has helped him maintain a strong personal approval rating, despite his government's flagging poll standing. But little has gone right for him in this campaign, including a recent interest rate rise, and he has carried the weight of past scandals and broken promises, such as a vow never to introduce a consumption tax. Fit and energetic, Howard power walks every day, often leaving younger reporters and advisers struggling to keep up. Opinion polls in the final week of the election campaign show the government remains between 8 and 10 points behind Labor, but Howard is hopeful of surviving one more election and says there is no public anger against his government. "I've been in a lot of election campaigns," Howard said on Thursday. "This is not an angry election campaig
