<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 21 (bdnews24.com)  The government has decided to allocate Tk 5000 to Tk 10000 in housing grants to cyclone-hit people, said law and information adviser Mainul Hosein in a news briefing Wednesday. "The cyclone victims do not want to stay at the cyclone shelters any more. They'd rather build their own homes with government assistance. "The government too has decided to release the grants as soon as possible," said the adviser at the information ministry conference room. He said Real Estate and Housing Association of Bangladesh (REHAB) would build some houses in the cyclone-ravaged areas. Mainul said all should mount a coordinated effort in this critical time and urged true patriots on to come out now to prove themselves. The government was not working with to gain popularity, rather it was doing its best to provide shelter to the homeless, Mainul said. He clarified that no-one needed to seek governmental clearance to distribute relief among the needy and that anyone could help the disaster victims at any place. Admitting irregularities in relief distribution, the adviser said it was not true that everybody was getting everything and that the government would probe any such irregularities. bdnews24
