<TITLE> Bangladesh tightens GSP system to stem forgery </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com) -- The government has decided to tighten the process for applicants to the generalised system of preferences in an attempt to stem continuing forgery by parties from third countries, a top Export Promotion Bureau official said Tuesday. The GSP facility allows Bangladesh duty-free access to the European Union market for all goods except armaments. The new, more rigorous requirements will see a change in the distribution and verification of GSP application forms. "Applicants will now have to register his or her name, the name of their organisation, and the name of the buyer's agent with the EPB before buying a GSP form," Sahab Ullah, vice-chairman of the EPB, told reporters after a meeting with exporters on the forgery issue. "We took the decision following a complaint from Germany, who have been subject to GSP forgery," said Sahab. The system up until now allowed anyone to buy GSP forms from prescribed banks, although widespread abuse of the vetting process provided businessmen from third countries the opportunity to export to the EU illegally. The EPB has also decided to send a delegation of government officials, and private sector businessmen, to the EU headquarters in Brussels and ot Germany to deal with the problem. Germany recently lodged a complaint stating that some countries had been exporting goods to their country using Bangladeshi GSP's. Following the complaint, Germany imposed a 12.5 percent duty on export consignments suspected of having forged GSP's. According to the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturer and Exporters Association, Bangladesh exported $3 billion worth of knitwear products to the EU in the 2006-07 fiscal year. The EPB vice-chairman said Germany seized about 300 GSP certificates suspected of being illegally obtained in the last five years. Of these, 60 were used by businesses based in third countries. "A delegation will go to Brussels and Germany soon. We will tell them to check the electronic GSP forms, and container shipments online, so they can easily detect whether a GSP certificate is fake or not," Sahab said. Earlier, Bangladesh requested Germany to check GSP forms and containers online, and inform the Bangladeshi authorities of any suspected forgery. However, Germany turned down the request, saying they would forward information on suspected consignment within four weeks of discovery. "We are very concerned about Germany's imposition of a 12.5 percent duty, in the form of a guarantee," BKMEA president Fazlul Hoque told bdnews24.com. Hoque said the EPB will send GSP forms to readymade garment trade bodies after issuing them to ensure they can be properly verified. bd
