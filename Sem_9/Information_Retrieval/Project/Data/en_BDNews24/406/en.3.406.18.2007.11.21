<TEXT>
 BUDAPEST, Nov 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hungarian rail workers began a six-hour strike on Wednesday that could lead to widespread protests against reformist Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany. Up to 50,000 anti-government demonstrators, backed by unions and the main opposition Fidesz party, will protest outside parliament later in the day, Hungarian media said. Gyurcsany's measures to cut Hungary's budget deficit and reform the rigid state sector have divided the country of 10 million people and caused tensions between the government and various groups. The influential rail unions, whose strike affected almost 1,300 trains on Wednesday, want to halt rural line closures by the state rail company MAV, which is losing hundreds of millions of dollars a year. In talks with the unions on Tuesday the government promised rural lines would stay in the timetable next year. The unions said they saw no guarantee the lines would not be closed. Other workers want to halt reforms to the state health insurance system. Hundreds of schools were closed and there was a brief strike at Budapest Airport, owned by Germany's Hochtief. Bus drivers at two regional firms, Koros Volan and Vasi Volan, held strikes to protest against new pension rules and civic groups partially closed some main roads to support the strikers. Analysts said the protests may push the government into concessions but not into a major policy change. "The government's measures had very negative impacts but reversing its policy can be equally risky," Attila Gyulai of Political Capital told Reuters. Gyurcsany's tax and price rises, as well as some cuts to the bloated state sector, have slashed the budget deficit from 9.2 percent of gross domestic product in 2006 to 6.4 percent this year and it is estimated it will fall to 3.2 percent by 2009. Gyurcsany, who has won the praise of markets and the European Union for slashing the budget deficit, is also facing a possible revolt among his Socialist MPs over reforms. The Socialists have been panicked by a plunge in their popularity ratings to just 15 percent and are embroiled in a row with their coalition partners over health reforms which aim to bring private money into the ailing system and to cut costs. Only two of Hungary's six main trade union groupings took part in Wednesday's strikes and rallies although other groups expressed solidarity with the goals of those on strike. "The unions are unlikely to rush into the large-scale (strike) action which we can see in France," said Gyulai. "The unions remain divided along political lines and their confidence rating within the society is relatively lo
