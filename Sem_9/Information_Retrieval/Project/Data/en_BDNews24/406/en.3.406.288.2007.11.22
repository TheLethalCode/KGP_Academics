<TEXT>
 CHANDPUR, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com)After the marauding super storm Sidr destroyed the little house of Shafique Gazi and wife Shahanara Begum on November 15, the couple with their two children were forced to starve for nearly five days. Shahanara, 40, said her 42-year-old husband was in their eldest daughter Rozina's place in Dhaka, and she only had her two minor sons, Suman, 7, and Sajiv, 5, to keep her company on that fateful night. It had started raining since afternoon that day. Accompanying the rains were squally winds. After dusk, the winds increased their ferocity. Shahanara crawled under bed with her sons fearing that her house might crumble. Soon after, her apprehensions came true. The roofing flew away and the house came down. Neighbours rescued them later. "What's the use of publishing our story? The chairman, membersno-one is bothered a bit about people like us. Nobody has enquired about us in the past days," she said. Shafique, a farmer, returned home from Dhakaa day after the cycloneonly to find a desolate Shahanara squatting under the open sky with their children. They had not got any relief from any source until Wednesday. They failed to feed their children too. He also tried in vain to borrow Tk 1,000 from a local cooperative to rebuild his hut. At last, the family retrieved the old posts from under the ruins of their fallen home and were trying to rebuild it. He said that they had been living by the polder for about nine years after the family had lost their old home in Khailabaj under Hanarchar union to river erosion. The cyclone has rendered them paupers again. bdnews24.com/c
