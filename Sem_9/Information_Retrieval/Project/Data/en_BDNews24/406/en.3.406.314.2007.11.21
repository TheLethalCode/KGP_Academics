<TEXT>
 PARIS, Nov 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks were down sharply by midday on Wednesday as investors continued to fret about banks' exposure to the turmoil in the credit market, while the record high euro and oil prices further dampened sentiment. Mining shares also took a beating, falling along with metal prices on worries over the prospect of a US slowdown that could curb demand for base metals. Rio Tinto lost 2.6 percent, Anglo American dropped 2.9 percent and Xstrata shed 4.2 percent. At 1200 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 1.9 percent at 1,452.49, after falling to a three-month low of 1,445.87. Europe's benchmark index is down 2.1 percent so far this year, compared with a 15 percent increase by the same time last year. Banking shares were once again the biggest negative weight behind the market's broad retreat, as jittery investors feared that financial institutions have not yet revealed the full impact of the credit crisis on their books. Fortis tumbled 4.4 percent, Societe Generale dropped 4.5 percent, UBS shed 4 percent and Barclays fell 3.2 percent. "We believe that uncertainty around the ultimate effects of the credit quake, as well as potential real economy implications, represent material headwinds for the sector and will prevent a sustained and broad-based recovery of share prices," Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a note. "We believe that marginal newsflow could deteriorate further before improving and could include contagion from the subprime crisis spreading to other credit segments and slowing economic growth." GLOBAL GROWTH Equities worldwide have been hit over the past few months by fears that the meltdown in the U.S. subprime mortgage market would dampen corporate profits and dent global growth. Financial institutions, including Citigroup Inc, Merrill Lynch & Co Inc, Morgan Stanley, as well as European banks such as UBS, have reported huge writedowns from worsening conditions in consumer credit and capital markets. Since the beginning of the year, the DJ STOXX bank index has lost 20 percent, UBS is down 34 percent, Royal Bank of Scotland down 38 percent and Fortis down 40 percent. U.S. crude oil futures rose over $99 a barrel on Wednesday on winter supplies and as the dollar continued to sink, fuelling worries over energy costs for companies. Shares of European manufacturers also retreated as the euro hit a record high against the dollar after the Federal Reserve said U.S. growth was likely to slow in 2008, fanning market hopes of more interest rate cuts. "We have reached unbearable levels for oil and currencies," said Romain Boscher, a fund manager at Groupama Asset Management. "We have to accept negative surprises for earnings for this quarter and next year." Auto makers were among the worst hit, with BMW down 2.1 percent, Fiat down 4.2 percent and Renault down 3.5 percent. The FTSEurofirst 300 index has fallen 9 percent so far this month to put the index on track for its worst month since September 2002, before a global equities bull run began. Around Europe, London's FTSE 100 was 1.4 percent weaker, Frankfurt's DAX lost 1.7 percent and Paris's CAC-40 slid 1.8 percent. Shares in telecom equipment maker Ericsson fell 5 percent, extending Tuesday's 11 percent tumble when management warned that sales and margins in the fourth quarter would be at the low end of announced ranges. Rival Alcatel-Lucent lost 4.3 perce
