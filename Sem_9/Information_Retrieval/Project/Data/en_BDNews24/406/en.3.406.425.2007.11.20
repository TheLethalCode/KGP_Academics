<TITLE> Iraq warns foreign security firms after shooting </TITLE>

 BAGHDAD, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Private security firms in Iraq which act outside the law will be dealt with firmly, officials said on Tuesday, after a woman was shot in central Baghdad. Monday's shooting was the latest in a string of incidents that have triggered widespread anger and prompted the Iraqi government to propose a change to the laws under which foreign security contractors operate. "We demand that all security companies obey the law and orders released by the Iraqi government, otherwise the security forces will be obliged to deal firmly with these companies," Baghdad security spokesman Brigadier-General Qassim Moussawi told a media conference. Moussawi and government officials identified the 43 people detained at an Iraqi checkpoint after the shooting as 21 Sri Lankans, nine Nepalis and one Indian. Twelve guards -- 10 Iraqis and two Fijians -- were with the convoy of four vehicles that drove through a square on the wrong side of the road, they said. A September shooting involving private U.S. firm Blackwater in which 17 Iraqis were killed prompted the government to approve a draft law to end a 2004 decree by former U.S. administrators that gave security contractors immunity from prosecution. That draft law must still be passed by parliament. U.S. military spokesman Major Winfield Danielson said those responsible for Monday's shooting could be charged under Iraqi law because the company involved, Dubai-based ALMCO, is a logistics contractor for food supply, construction and training rather than a security firm. "If they do decide to file charges, the government of Iraq does apparently have that authority," he said. THREE CHARGES Moussawi said Iraqi officials would seek to bring three charges against those responsible for shooting the woman. "There was a violation of Iraqi law," he said. "They were driving on the wrong side of the road, there was a random shooting and they hit a woman in her legs." Contacted in Dubai, ALMCO said it had no comment about the incident. The woman was seriously wounded as she crossed the road, Moussawi said. Angry bystanders threw stones as the convoy sped away. On Monday, Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh on Monday identified the two foreign guards as American, not Fijian. "They told us that they were Americans," he said on Tuesday. "We checked with the (US) embassy and we know they're Fijians who claimed to be Americans," Dabbagh told Reuters. Moussawi said the pair had US identity documents. The US military said ALMCO was contracted by the US Department of Defense and provided its own security. "It is up to the government of Iraq to determine what charges, if any, will be filed," Danielson said. Many Iraqis regard foreign security guards as little more than private armies which act with impunity. Blackwater says it acted lawfully in the September shooting but the incident sparked a flurry of investigations and strained relations between Washington and Iraq. The Pentagon and US State Department have since agreed to tighten rules for private security contractors. Iraq says there are more than 180 mainly US and European security firms in the country, and the number of private security guards is estimated at between 25,000 and 48,0
