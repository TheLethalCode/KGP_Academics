<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 16 (bdnews24.com) -- The Regulatory Reforms Commission will send a set of recommendations to the government in one month, aiming to bring dynamism to economic activities, its chairman Akbar Ali Khan said Monday. "Our prime duty is to reduce government control on rules and regulations," Khan told reporters after the first meeting of the commission at the Board of Investment office. "The commission has also decided to submit its recommendations every month," he said. Commission members FBCCI president Mir Nasir Hossain, businessman Abdur Rouf Chowdhury and economists Hossain Zillur Rahman and Prof Mustafizur Rahman were present at the briefing. In a major policy development, the interim administration formed the 17-menber commission on October 30 to modernise the age-old rules and regulations to infuse dynamism into the economy, governance and administration. Khan said the country's existing rules and regulations needed to be updated to cope with fast-paced globalisation. "But our priority is to update and ease the rules related to economic activities, investment, commerce and trade," Khan said. "We've formed sub-committees on private and foreign loan processing, environmental clearance for setting up industries and issues related to bonded warehouse licensing, capital machinery import and duty-draw back, to deal with bottlenecks in the private sector," he said. The RRC chairman said that the three committees would submit their reports in one month. The commission also took two other decisionsto recommend that the government arrange pre-publication of rules or regulations before publishing them officially while the other would be to request the government to post all gazette notifications on websites, Khan said. He said the commission would seek suggestions from the people soon to carry out work properly. Replying to a query, Khan said the commission's work was to change the rules and regulations, not the existing laws. "We'll send a proposal relating to laws to the Law Commission," he replied. The tenure of the commission is one year. As per its scope of work, the commission can co-opt any experienced person for accomplishing its task for a particular period for a particular purpose mentioned in the notification. The government will then incorporate that person through gazette notification. bd
