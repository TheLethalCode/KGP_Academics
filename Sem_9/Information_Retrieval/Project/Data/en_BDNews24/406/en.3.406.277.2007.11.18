 JAIPUR, India, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Skipper Shoaib Malik top-scored with 89 and took three wickets as Pakistan defeated India by 31 runs in the fifth and final one-dayer on Sunday. Pakistan amassed 306 for six wickets after being asked to bat first and then bowled out India for 275 with a ball to spare in the day-night game. India won the series 3-2. Malik claimed 3-61 bowling off spin to set up the morale-boosting win for the visitors. Earlier he added 168 runs for the fourth wicket with Mohammad Yousuf, who scored 74 for his third half-century of the series, after paceman Shanthakumaran Sreesanth's had taken the first three wickets to fall. Left-arm paceman Sohail Tanvir struck three early blows to reduce India to 62 for four in reply to undermine the chase and despite fifties by young Rohit Sharma (52) and Yuvraj Singh (50), Pakistan never eased their grip
