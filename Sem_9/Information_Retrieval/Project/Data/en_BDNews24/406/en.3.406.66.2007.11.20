 Dhaka, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) will discuss Thursday the possible deferment of district and divisional football association elections. "We have called an emergency meeting Thursday to discuss the possible deferment of the DFA elections as it is not possible to hold them in the southern districts after cyclone Sidr," said BFF acting secretary Manzoor Hossain Malu Tuesday. The elections of the district football associations are scheduled by December 5 and the elections of the divisional football associations, December 14. A source seeking anonymity said that the BFF was going to announce a date for the extraordinary general meeting (EGM) for the final approval of the DFA constitution, including the deferment of the entire DFA elections after Thursday's meeting. The BFF high-ups earlier said that there was no need to hold an EGM or annual general meeting (AGM) to approve the DFA constitution before the DFA elections, but they were seemingly under pressure to hold the EGM or AGM following the one-day Dhaka visit of AFC vice president Manilal Fernando. Fernando agreed with the notion of holding EGM or AGM before the DFA elections after meeting with the National Sports Council chairman, its secretary, Bangladesh Olympic Association chief operational officer, the BFF president and the BFF acting secretary. NSC and BOA officials also explained to Fernando the actual situation after the FIFA directed the BFF to keep all government officials out of the DFA committees. Fernando, also a FIFA development director, at a press conference later, said that he would try to make the FIFA understand the Bangladesh position in this connection.
