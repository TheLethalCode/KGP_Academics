 Barguna, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Monday called on people across the broader social spectrum to help in the rescue and rehabilitation activities for the cyclone-ravaged people in the south. The CA visited Majherchar in the coastal district of Barguna in the morning to sympathise with the storm-afflicted people. He could not hold back tears watching the sufferings of the battered people. "I understand and appreciate the indomitable courage of our coastal people. The loss of lives and property has, therefore, been reduced because the locals faced it boldly," said Fakhruddin to reporters at Barguna Circuit House later. He said that the government had already allocated Tk 1.38 crore for the cyclone-hit people of Barguna district and that they would get another Tk 1.5 crore in the next phase of rehabilitation. He told reporters that he had ordered officials to restore the disrupted communications systems as soon as possible. He ordered that five officers who had served in Barguna in the past and were familiar with the local ways be deployed there on deputation on an emergency basis. bdnews2
