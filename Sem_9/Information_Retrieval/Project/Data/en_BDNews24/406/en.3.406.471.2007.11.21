<TEXT>
 Dhaka, November 21 (bdnews24.com)  Hajj flights for non-ballottee pilgrims started operating Tuesday after a delay of nine days, officials said Wednesday. A senior Biman official told bdnews24.com that the Saudi government had delayed issuing visas to non-ballottee pilgrims because the Hajj Agencies Association of Bangladesh failed to arrange adequate accommodation for the pilgrims in Jeddah. "We have rented houses for the hajjis. The Saudi government also approved their visas, so there won't be any uncertainty regarding private hajj passengers from now on," HABB president Md Faruque told bdnews24.com. According to Biman, it is operating hajj flights this year with two of their own DC-10 aircraft and a leased Boeing 747. The government is arranging 5,583 pilgrimages for Bangladeshis in 2007. Saudia will transport around 10,000 pilgrims of them. The religious affairs ministry and Biman are jointly operating the hajj camp opposite Zia International Airport. Biman incurred a loss of Tk 15 crore in 2006 after a shortfall in hajj passengers. Hajj ticket prices have been fixed at $1,250 per passenger for 2007. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed oversaw the launch of the hajj flights at Zia International Airport on Nov 12. bdnews24
