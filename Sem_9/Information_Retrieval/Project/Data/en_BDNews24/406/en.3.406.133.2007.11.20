<TEXT>
 Abuja, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nigeria will investigate five ex-ministers and other senior officials named as recipients of 10 million euros ($14.6 million) in bribes from industrial group Siemens in a German court ruling, the presidency said. A Munich court fined Siemens 201 million euros on Oct. 4 for bribes paid to Nigerian, Russian and Libyan officials by a former manager of one of the group's telecommunications equipment units. Details were not made public at the time. On Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported details of the court ruling. It said most of the bribes, about 10 million euros, went to Nigerians including the five ex-ministers. The names and sums involved were widely reported in the Nigerian press over the weekend, and President Umaru Yar'Adua reacted by saying he had ordered security agencies to investigate and take appropriate legal action. "The president further assures that in this Siemens scandal, as in all cases that border on good governance and transparency, there will neither be sacred cows nor a cover up for anybody found culpable of breaching the law," said a statement issued on Sunday in Saudi Arabia, where he was attending an OPEC meeting. The opposition Action Congress party called the Siemens scandal "a national disgrace" and urged Yar'Adua to act quickly. Nigerian newspapers on Monday quoted several of the ex-ministers named in the German ruling as denying that they took bribes. A Siemens spokesman had no comment on Monday other than to refer callers to the Oct. 4 verdict. The company has said that it accepted the judgement. Yar'Adua took office on May 29 promising zero tolerance for corruption in one of the world's most tainted countries, but his message has been undermined by a series of scandals. SCANDALS The speaker of the House of Representatives was forced to step down after she was found to have improperly awarded contracts worth $5 million for the renovation of her official residence and that of her deputy. Anti-corruption police have charged five ex-state governors with embezzlement and have said they are investigating several others, though there has been no conviction. A former executive of oil services firm Willbros pleaded guilty in a US court to paying $6 million in bribes to senior officials from the Nigerian government, ruling party and state oil company to win a gas pipeline building contract. Nigeria has pledged to follow up on the Willbros case at home. The Siemens ruling, according to details reported by the Wall Street Journal, focuses on bribes paid between 2001 and 2004 and connected to a former manager in a telecommunications equipment unit. The ruling lists bribes from 2,000 euros to 2.25 million euros steered to government officials in Nigeria, Libya and Russia, the newspaper said. About 10 million euros went to Nigerians including the five former ministers. The newspaper said Siemens has sold telecommunications equipment in Nigeria, but the ruling did not specify what contracts Siemens was seeking when its employees paid bribes. It also did not say what, if anything, the recipients of Siemens's money did in exchange for it.
