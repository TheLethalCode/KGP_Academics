<TITLE> Japan bank hit, Paulson says defaults to rise </TITLE>

 LONDON, Nov 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Shrinking profits at Japan's biggest bank, largely due to the subprime mortgage meltdown, stretched market nerves on Wednesday as the United States predicted a higher rate of home loan defaults next year. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson told the Wall Street Journal the number of potential U.S. defaults would be markedly bigger in 2008 than in 2007 as less creditworthy mortgages worked through the system. "The nature of the problem will be significantly bigger next year because 2006 (mortgages) had lower underwriting standards, no amortization and no down payments," Paulson said. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development calculated that some $890 billion of poor credit quality mortgages would have rates reset in 2008. Cumulative losses in the $200-$300 billion range from the mortgage market crisis "seem feasible", it said. Following a string of write-offs by major US banks, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group reported a 49 percent drop in first-half profit, due to hefty losses on subprime-related investments and at its credit card unit. It said its exposure to products tied to the subprime loan market stood at 260 billion yen ($2.38 billion). Earnings at Japan's second- and third-largest banks, Mizuho Financial Group Inc and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, have already been hit by subprime turmoil. World stocks tumbled as concerns for the health of the U.S. economy stirred the biggest wave of risk aversion since August in global financial markets. The OECD said the global credit crunch could yet inflict greater damage to equities. "It may well be that the recent correction is only a precursor of a more protracted downturn," it said in its latest Financial Markets Trends report. The Federal Reserve on Tuesday cut its 2008 growth outlook and the United States' No. 2 mortgage lender Freddie Mac posted a record quarterly loss, ramping up fears about the U.S. housing sector and its impact on the broader economy. In addition to minutes of its meeting last month showing its decision to cut rates was a "close call", the Fed projected growth next year of 1.8-2.5 percent, sharply down from the 2.5-2.75 percent it forecast in June. MONEY MARKET STRESS London interbank offered rates for two-month euro deposits rose to a fresh 6-1/2 year high on Wednesday, reflecting persistent demand for year-end funding and ongoing stress in money markets. Europe financial credit spreads widened to record highs. Bank of England deputy governor John Gieve warned there might be more upheaval to come in financial markets and money markets could be squeezed more sharply before the year-end. According to the Telegraph newspaper, Gieve told a conference: "There is still a worry that we haven't yet seen the bottom. Some markets are still very illiquid. As the year end approaches, we may see some tightening in money markets." With subprime mortgages -- lent to people ill-equipped to pay them back who are now defaulting en masse -- bundled up into complex financial products and sold on around the globe, uncertainty about where the exposure lies remains intense. Stricken British bank Northern Rock said it had received more rescue proposals, but warned that one of them contemplated an offer well below Tuesday's closing price, sparking a new slide in its shares. The lender was forced to go to the Bank of England for emergency loans two months ago, as the global squeeze on credit caused its funding strategy to collapse, prompting the first run on a British bank since the 19th century. The Financial Times reported that asset manager BlackRock is set to be signed up as the manager of a $75 billion fund being put together by US banks to help struggling structured investment vehicles (SIVs). It did not cite its source. Citigroup, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase said last month they would set up the pooled asset fund to prevent SIVs being forced to sell off those assets in the absence of short-term financing. The OECD said the super fund, if it prevented a further fire sale of those assets, was a crucial mechanism to buy time to ensure an orderly work-through of the probl
