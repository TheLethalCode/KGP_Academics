<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com)  Police Monday went to seize the Mercedes car of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina as "evidence" in the August 21 grenade attack case. Assistant superintendent of police Md Fazlul Kabir went to her Sudha Sadan home at 12:45pm but could not seize it as the driver was away. He said the car would be seized by Monday evening. The Awami League chief had used it on August 21, 2004 when the grenade attack was launched on an AL rally on Bangabandhu Avenue. Kabir said the vehicle would be produced before court as evidence since it bore marks of assaults on its body. He said the vehicle was supposed to be seized immediately after the August 21, 2004 incident, but it was not possible as Sudha Sadan did not permit that. The grenade attack perpetrated during the BNP-led alliance government's reign left frontline AL leader Ivy Rahman and 21 others killed. bdnews24
