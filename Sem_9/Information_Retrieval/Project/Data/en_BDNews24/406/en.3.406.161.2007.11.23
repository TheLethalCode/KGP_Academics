 DHAKA, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com) -- Detained former prime minister Khaleda Zia Thursday challenged the Anticorruption Commission's notice on her wealth statement, in a writ petition filed with the High Court, her lawyer said. Khaleda's lawyers filed the appeal with justices Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Zubayer Rahman Chowdhury. "The hearing may take place Sunday," Khaleda's attorney barrister Mahbubuddin Khokon told bdnews24.com by phone. The graft watchdog served notice on Khaleda on July 18 setting her an initial seven-workday deadline, but she finally turned in her wealth statement on August 6 after the deadline was extended. Khaleda was arrested on Sept 3 in a graft case filed by the ACC, along with her son Arafat Rahman Coco. bd
