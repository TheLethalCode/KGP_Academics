<TITLE> EU assuages Germany in bid to save satellite plan </TITLE>

 BRUSSELS, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Commission and EU budget ministers tried to assuage Germany on Friday in a drive to rescue Europe's troubled Galileo navigation satellite project, intended to rival the US Global Positioning System. The EU executive also warned it would have to drop the ambitious industrial project if there was no agreement among the 27 member states on public funding by the end of the year. Berlin has been blocking the use of unspent EU budget funds, mainly earmarked for agriculture, partly because it feared German firms could be shut out of major work on Galileo under the initial tendering scheme. To satisfy German demands that no one aerospace firm should dominate the project, the Commission proposed redividing the tenders for Galileo into six segments and barring any company from being the prime contractor on more than two of them. "At the moment, there is no member state that showed any opposition ... so we are convinced that a solution can be found inside this framework," Michele Cercone, spokesman for EU Transport Commissioner Jacques Barrot, told a news conference. Finance officials met at the same time to discuss ways of diverting unused EU budget funds to help finance the 3.4 billion euro ($5.1 billion) project after private companies declined to carry the risk. Cercone said the Commission was aiming for a deal at an EU transport ministers' meeting on Nov. 29 and the final deadline for an accord on funding was the end of the year. "If we don't have clear agreement on financing of Galileo by the end of this year, it would mean we would have to put an end to our efforts because it would clearly be too late," he said. GERMAN WELCOME In Berlin, a German Transport Ministry spokesman welcomed the Commission proposal, saying it would secure competition and could lead to benefits for German companies. "If a proposal like that comes through and the financing is secured, it would offer a decisive benefit for Germany's aerospace industry," he told a news conference. Unused EU funds are normally returned to member states and Germany, the biggest net contributor to the 27-nation bloc's coffers, is determined to avoid setting a costly precedent. To placate Berlin, diplomats said EU leaders could issue a declaration next month pledging the use of up to 2.5 billion euros in unspent funds for Galileo would remain an exception. A source close to Barrot said the project segments would include satellites, launchers, ground mission infrastructure and control, system software, and other tasks. There would be the possibility of two tenders to build 26 satellites that make up the system, which is expected to have 30 satellites in total. "The bidder will have to put an offer for all 26, but then we will contract only for a first batch of 10, for example," the source said. "If costs, delays and quality are respected for this batch, that means that the bidder has the market for the second batch. And if that's not the case, then we re-open the tender." A minimum requirement for subcontracting was also put on the table, the source said. The change was aimed at persuading Berlin to stop blocking EU budget financing of the project. Galileo is the EU's answer to the United States's GPS satellite system. It faces a 2.4 billion euro cash shortfall because private companies balked at shouldering most of the costs. Supporters say it is a vital technological platform for Europe but critics say it could be a costly white elephant because the US system already has a dominant market position and Russia and China are working on their own systems. The original consortium of companies charged with building Galileo included EADS, France's Thales and Alcatel-Lucent. Britain-based Inmarsat, Italy's Finmeccanica, Spain's AENA and Hispasat and a German group that included Deutsche Telekom were also involved but the consortium collapsed after the firms refused to foot a large chunk of the bill for the proje
