 DHAKA, Nov 21 (bdnews24.com)  Initial elation over improved disaster preparedness threatened to come undone Wednesday as authorities struggled to deliver aid to the survivors of the Nov 15 cyclone that killed about 3,000 people. A shortage of drinking water was turning out to be one of the most critical factors in keeping survivors alive. Tidal surges, some up to 5 metres high, inundated coastal areas with salt water, contaminating surface drinking water supplies. Abdul Hamid, a 50-year-old survivor from Bakultola village in Bagerhat said: "If nothing else, please get water drinking water to us." The village of Bakultola and surrounding villages in Swarankhola near the Sundarbans were a study in utter devastation. Karimunessa survived the storm with her two children by clinging desperately to the branches of a tree, but worries about whether they'll survive the aftermath. Her house, along with the rest of Bakultola, was swept away in the storm. The family received enough rice to last two meals from a local aid group. There is no certainty beyond those two meals. Her children are traumatised by the events of the past week, and represent a less-talked-about public health calamity that lurks beneath the surface. Widespread trauma, especially for young children whose landscape is marked by corpses and whose feelings are numbed by grief and hunger, highlights the massive psychological toll left in the wake of Sidr. Rafiqul, a young boy in Bakultola, said he spent the night of the storm holding on to the branches of a tree that had the corpse of a middle-age woman wedged in it. "I thought I'd die: from drowning, from the fright of having a corpse pressing against me. When it was over, I swam home. My mother was alive. My little sister was not." He shivered, "I am always afraid." In Patharghata, Barguna, NGO worker AK Azad has set up a children's centre in a storm shelter to help children get over the tragedy. In the Save the Children UK sponsored programme, some 400 children run around and play games with the added assurance of having lunch provided for them. Failures in the relief distribution system came to the fore Wednesday as some survivors brawled with each other at relief centres unable to cope with demands. Fights broke out at a government aid camp in Purba Saralia where officials only had enough for half the number of people that had come in search of food. Another fight broke out in Basal Bar, where thousands had queued up for food before dawn. Relief centre officials assured hungry storm-stricken people that more food would arrive Thursday. bdnews24.com's Sanjay Dey in Patuakhali said the relief effort was still not up to speed. He said aid had not yet made it to Barobagia, the worst-hit area under the upazila, despite Amtoli upazila nirbahi officer Abu Nayeem Muhammad Abdus Sabur's claims that relief supplies had been sent out to ravaged areas. Delays in getting to storm-ravaged areas and shortages in supplies getting to survivors plagued relief efforts. Fears of an outbreak of diarrhea were on aid givers' minds. "The problem is that aid workers need hours to reach these remote areas. Poor communications are also hampering our work," said BRAC spokesman Anwarul Huq. bd
