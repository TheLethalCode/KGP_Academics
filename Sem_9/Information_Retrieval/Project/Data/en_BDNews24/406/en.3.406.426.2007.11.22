 DHAKA, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com)  Abahani Limited Thursday dropped out of the running for the Bordoloi Trophy in the semifinals after losing to Mumbai's 10-man ONGC 5-4 in a tie-breaker in Guwahati, India. B League champions Abahani failed to break the defense of ONGC, who were reduced to 10 men after 46 minutes, as the match rolled into extra time after regulation time ended in a goal-less draw. No team found the back of the net in the extra 30 minutes of play, and the match moved into a penalty shootout. The tie-breaker locked at 4-4 after five players from each side took part in the shootout. Abahani later failed to covert the first shot of the sudden death tie-breaker. Saiful Islam Moni, Charles Ghansa, Nazrul Islam and Jahid Hasan Amili converted while Prodeep Poddar and Pranotosh missed the target.
