<TITLE> Japan PM Fukuda's Asia debut symbolises thaw in ties </TITLE>

 SINGAPORE, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's prime minister on Tuesday promised he would visit China as soon as possible, in a symbol of warming ties, but the leaders of both countries side-stepped issues that could undermine relations. Yasuo Fukuda, making his Asian diplomacy debut after taking office in September, held his first summit with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and also had lunch with the Chinese leader on the sidelines of an Asian leaders' meeting in Singapore. "Such a luncheon in a third country is unprecedented," a top Fukuda aide who sat in on the meetings told reporters. "The two leaders were able to build a relationship of trust." Fukuda told Wen he intended to visit China by the end of the year or early next year, and called for a visit to Japan by Chinese President Hu Jintao next year, plans welcomed by Wen, the aide also said. "Our relations are at a historically important juncture towards further progress. We must take up on this opportunity," the Japanese official quoted Wen as telling Fukuda. Fukuda and Wen were joined earlier by South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun, and the leaders agreed to hold a three-way summit regularly, apart from their annual get-togethers at the Association of South East Asian Nations summit, Japanese officials said. The moves for closer ties are in stark contrast to relations under former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi, who only met Chinese and South Korean leaders occasionally. Koizumi's annual visits to a war memorial angered his neighbours, who regard Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine as a symbol of Japan's past militarism. A Chinese naval destroyer will make the first ever visit to Japan later this month, a plan originally set in 2000, but failed to materialise as ties deteriorated under Koizumi. "When I visited China four years ago, things were very tough," Fukuda was also quoted as telling Wen. Koizumi was in power from 2001 until September 2006. Koizumi's successor, Shinzo Abe, began mending fences with trips to Beijing and Seoul, before abruptly resigning two months ago. Japan and China have agreed to resolve a row over gas exploration in a disputed area in the East China Sea by the end of autumn, but failed to reach a breakthrough in talks held in Japan last week, prompting Tokyo to warn that the lack of progress might even affect Fukuda's planned visit to China. In Tuesday's meeting, Fukuda and Wen only agreed to work towards a resolution and did not set any new deadlines, Japanese officials said. Fukuda did not raise the issue of China's increasing military spending, which Tokyo has long said lacks transparency, officials add
