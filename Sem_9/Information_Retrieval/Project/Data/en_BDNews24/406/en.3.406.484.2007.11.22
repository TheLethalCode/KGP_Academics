 Dhaka, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Thursday set BNP chairperson's adviser ASM Hannan Shah free on bail for three weeks in an emergency powers rules breach case. The court also ordered the government two weeks to explain why the case proceedings will not be cancelled. The two-strong bench of justices Syed Mohammad Dastgir Hossain and Muhammad Abdul Hafiz issued the ruling on a petition filed by Hannan on Sunday, challenging the case and seeking bail. Tejgaon police filed the case on Nov 7 against seven persons including Hannan on charges of breaching the emergency powers rules and harassing pro-reform BNP leader Mahbubur Rahman at the graveside of Ziaur Rahman at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar. Hannan was arrested the same night and remanded on Nov 8 for three days for questioning. Barrister Rafique-Ul Haque, Hannan's counsel, said during the hearing, "My client was arrested simply because some quarters would like to harass him politically." Barrister Mahbub Uddin Khokon, Hannan's other lawyer, told bdnews24.com that he had so far been granted bail in six cases, including this case. bdnews2
