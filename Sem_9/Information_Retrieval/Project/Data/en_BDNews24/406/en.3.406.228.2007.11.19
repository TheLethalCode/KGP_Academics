<TITLE> Kaka's strike not enough as Brazil held by Peru </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LIMA, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kaka scored a stunning 30-metre goal as Brazil were held to a 1-1 draw by a feisty Peru in Sunday's World Cup qualifier. Kaka, who scored twice in last month's 5-0 thrashing of Ecuador, was on target in the 40th minute to give Brazil the lead in the South American group match. Underdogs Peru hit back in the 71st minute when Juan Vargas scored with a deflected shot from outside the area, the first his team have scored in the group and the first conceded by Brazil. Brazil almost snatched a winner when Juan headed against the crossbar from a free kick in the last move of the game. Brazil have five points from three games and Peru two after three games of the marathon, two-year qualifying campaign. Peru, who last qualified for the World Cup in 1982, subjected Brazil to some intense early pressure when Vargas went close with a low left-foot shot from outside the area while Jefferson Farfan fired over on the edge of the penalty area. Brazil weathered the storm and had a series of chances. Maicon headed wide from a free kick before Robinho had his shot charged down by Diego Penny. Vagner Love, who had won possession on the edge of the penalty area, then shot just wide of the post. Kaka, however, broke the deadlock in the 40th minute when he was found by Miniero and the AC Milan player's dipping 30-metre shot swerved away from Penny's reach. Kaka nearly added another two minutes later with a chip which Penny turned over. The second half got off to a slow start as Brazil tried to slow the game down and frustrate the hosts. Brazil were close to a second when Penny turned Ronaldinho's free kick around the post and saved another in a scramble following the resulting corner. Peru equalised in the 71st minute when Juan Vargas met a half clearance with a low left-foot shot from 25 metres which took a deflection off Lucio on its way into the goal. Farfan set up a clear chance for a Peru winner when he found Claudio Pizarro free on the edge of the area but the Chelsea striker's first touch let him down and he lost the ball. Brazil finished on the attack and Juan, who had a superb game in defence, was foiled by the crossbar deep into injury time
