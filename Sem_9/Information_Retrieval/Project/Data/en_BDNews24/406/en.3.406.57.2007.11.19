 Dhaka, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh had lost a staggering Tk 23,000 crore in the power sector over the past decade, Transparency International Bangladesh said in a report Monday. TIB Board of Trustees chairman Muzaffer Ahmad presided over the TIB function marking the publication of a power sector research report. Research official Md Zakir Hossain Khan presented the report. Of the losses, some Tk 18,930 crore was incurred because of abuses in technical matters and distribution. Another Tk 4007 crore had been embezzled during the purchase of six power plants and the appointment of foreign companies for their maintenance. The report said Tk 8,355 crore was lost to the effects of power shortages on production and machinery. Past governments had failed to prioritise the power sector, participants at the meeting said. The report pointed out that just 42 percent of the total population used electricity at the rate of about 140 units of power per head. If distribution losses could be reduced by 12 percent, the government would be able to derive an additional Tk 1,853 crore in revenue. Subscribers owed Tk 390 crore to the Power Development Board, Tk 788 crore to the Dhaka Electric Supply Authority and Tk 464 crore to the Rural Electrification Board. The sleaze watchdog suggested a number of recommendations including an amendment to the power law, a resolution of outstanding cases and the formation of an independent commission to implement project  Vision 2025. bdnews24.
