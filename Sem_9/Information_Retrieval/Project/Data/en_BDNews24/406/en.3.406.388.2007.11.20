 SAO PAULO, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazil coach Dunga has shrugged off worries about an unfriendly reception when his side host Uruguay at the Morumbi stadium in Wednesday's World Cup qualifier. Brazil go into the game with five points from three games in the South American World Cup qualifying group and on the back of a 1-1 draw in Peru which earned heavy criticism for coach Dunga's side. Uruguay, held 2-2 at home to Chile on Sunday, have one point fewer. Brazil have always found their smaller neighbours to be tough customers and have not beaten them since the Copa America final in 1999. Since then, there have been six meetings with five draws and a win for Uruguay. Although Brazil have never lost a World Cup qualifier at home, the Morumbi, home to Kaka's former club Sao Paulo, has often been more of a hindrance than a help. Dunga was jeered as a player during a match against Ecuador in 1993 and furious fans hurled their flags on to the pitch in protest against Colombia in 2000, even though Brazil won 1-0. In response, Brazil rescheduled their remaining games in the 2002 qualifiers to be played at other venues and staged only one of nine home games at the stadium in the 2006 qualifying tournament. Kaka, now with AC Milan and one of the world's top players, was raised at Sao Paulo but left the club at a low ebb in 2003 after repeatedly being given a hard time by the supporters. Despite this, the match is being billed as a happy homecoming for the 25-year-old. "My story in football is connected to the Morumbi," he told the Brazilian Football Confederation's Web site (http://cbfnews.uol.com.br). "It will be a different sort of emotion to return to the stadium in a Brazil shirt." Dunga said he expected full support. "I believe the Sao Paulo crowd is mature, reads a lot and knows how important the Brazil team is," he told reporters on Monday. Brazil defender Lucio is suspended on two yellow cards, otherwise Dunga said he did not plan changes despite the disappointing display against Peru. "I'm not changing the team because of one game," he said. Uruguay are without injured Atletico Madrid striker Diego Forlan and midfielder Diego Perez is doubtful with a thigh strain. Possible teams: Brazil: Julio Cesar; Maicon, Alex Costa, Juan, Gilberto; Mineiro, Gilberto Silva, Ronaldinho, Kaka; Robinho, Vagner Love Uruguay: Fabian Carini; Maximiliano Pereira, Diego Lugano, Diego Gogin, Jorge Fucile; Arevalo Egidio Rios, Walter Gargano, Ignacio Rodriguez, Cristian Rodriguez; Luis Suarez, Sebastian Abreu Referee: Hector Baldassi (Argentina
