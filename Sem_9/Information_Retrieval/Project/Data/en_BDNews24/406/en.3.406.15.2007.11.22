<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com)  Two election commissioners Thursday said Bangladeshis living in the UK did not want any overseas unit of political parties. Election commissioners Sohul Hossain and Md Sakhawat Hossain briefed reporters in the Election Commission secretariat after a two-week tour of the UK. They exchanged views with expatriates in London, Birmingham, Edinburgh and Manchester over voter-registration. Nearly three lakh Bangladeshis live in the UK and 80,000 of them are voters. Sakhawat said: "We did not ask them anything. Most of them talked to us on their own. They opposed any unit abroad of political parties." "Everybody has his opinion about politics. But the expatriates are against any office of political parties abroad. They said it would put negative impact on British society." Sohul said, "Eighty percent of those who had attended the view exchange meetings gave opinion against overseas unit of political parties. It was like a voice vote." The EC in its electoral reform proposals opposed overseas unit of political parties. It would finalise the matter on the basis of the views of political parties. Citing an opinion poll conducted by a UK-based Bangla private television station, Sohul said 95 percent people there wished to be voters. "They are citizens of our country. Many may have British passport but they are Bangladeshi in their hearts. They remit huge money. We want to make them voter even if it is on a small scale," he said. Sakhawat said voter registration centres would be set up in major cities of the UK to make Bangladeshi passport holders voters. They would also be given national identity cards, he added. On how the expatriates would vote, Sohul said it might be through postal ballot. "It is not possible to hold polls setting up EC branch in High Commission office." He said the expatriates were keen to have their names on electoral roll. "They told us that they had been expressing their willingness to be voters since independence. Many made pledges but nobody did it in 36 years." bdnew
