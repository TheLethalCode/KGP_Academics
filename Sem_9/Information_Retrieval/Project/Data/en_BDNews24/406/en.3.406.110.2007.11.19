<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has halted its planned Nov 22 meeting with BNP's Hafizuddin Ahmed, CEC ATM Shamsul Huda said Monday. The decision came a day after the High Court put a four-week freeze on the main polls office's letter to BNP's acting secretary general inviting him to dialogue on electoral reform. "We will wait until the legal issue is settled," Huda told reporters. Asked to comment on whether the EC would file a counter-appeal against the HC stay order, he said: "We will make a decision in consultation with the attorney general." The CEC said work on the electoral roll in the cyclone-ravaged areas was deferred for nine days. He said the disaster would not halt progress on the election roadmap. "The roadmap was designed keeping the matter of national disaster in mind." bdnew
