 Dhaka, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com) Government employees have decided to donate a day's salary to cyclone victims, a top official said Thursday. The decision came from a secretaries committee meeting, chaired by cabinet secretary Ali Imam Majumder. "The money will be deposited to the chief adviser's relief fund. But the third and fourth class employees of the affected areas need not chip in," Majumder told reporters. "The chiefs of a number of organisations including the Department of Public Health Engineering, Roads and Highways Department and Directorate General of Health Services have been asked to oversee rehabilitation programmes." "Two lists of damaged schools and colleges have been made. The government will repair the less-affected academic institutions and foreign aid will be sought for more-affected ones." "It has been a week since the cyclone struck. We have made secretaries aware of relief and rehabilitation operations and foreign aid. They are also ordered to work among themselves," Majumder said. Aminul Islam Bhuiyan, secretary to the Economic Relations Division, said he would have a meeting with development partners on the full extent of losses in the first week of December. Md Aminul Islam, secretary to the Chief Adviser's Office, said: "The government is working toward two goals. The first is to bring normalcy to the lives of cyclone victims and the other is to ensure safety." "We are providing them with all materials possible. We are supplying water-purifying tablets and installing water-purification plants to ensure pure drinking water." The farmers' loans will be rescheduled and commercial banks have been asked to be kind in giving them loans, Amin said. bdnews24.com/a
