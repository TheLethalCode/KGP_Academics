 BAGHDAD, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Al Qaeda militants killed at least eight members of a neighborhood police patrol in southern Baghdad on Thursday, raking them with heavy machine-gun fire from a stolen Iraqi army vehicle, police said. The al Qaeda fighters surprised the tribal police unit by driving up to them in the vehicle they had commandeered after shooting at least two Iraqi soldiers. They opened fire on the police patrol in the Hawr Rajab area of southern Baghdad's Doura district, a mainly Sunni Arab area and al Qaeda stronghold, after approaching in at least one of two vehicles they had stolen. An Interior Ministry official confirmed that eight "Awakening Council" police patrol members had been killed. He said three Iraqi soldiers were killed and another three were wounded, and that two al Qaeda gunmen had also been killed. Separately, at least two mortar bombs landed inside Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone, a government spokesman said. Smoke could be seen rising from the compound which houses the US embassy and Iraqi parliament, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or damage. Mortar and rocket attacks were almost a daily occurrence earlier this year but have fallen off dramatically with overall declines in levels of violence in Baghdad and elsewhere. The falls in attacks have been attributed to a "surge" of 30,000 extra US troops, which became fully operational in mid-June, and the growing use of neighborhood police units. Mainly Sunni Arab tribal sheikhs have been organizing young men into the local police units, known as concerned local citizens, to drive out Sunni Islamist al Qaeda. HUMVEES SEIZED Police at Baghdad's Yarmouk hospital said two Iraqi army "humvee" vehicles had been seized at the start of the attack at Hawr Rajab. The police patrol did not challenge the occupants because they took them for soldiers. The bodies of eight of the patrol and two soldiers were taken to the Yarmouk hospital in western Baghdad, Iraqi police said. Another four were wounded. Reuters Television footage showed several coffins being loaded onto the back of a police truck to be taken to hospital. Another was tied to the top of a dilapidated car. A young woman and two toddlers, one of them crying, sat on the ground next to one simple wooden coffin. Separately, Iraqi soldiers supported by U.S. forces killed 19 al Qaeda fighters north of Baquba, Major-General Abdul-Karim al-Rubaie, the head of Iraqi military operations in Diyala province northeast of Baghdad, told Reuters. The al Qaeda fighters were killed in an area controlled by the al Qaeda-linked Islamic State in Iraq, he said. Two members of a neighborhood police unit there were killed in the operation and another three were wounded. The neighborhood patrols, backed by the U.S. military as part of a counter-insurgency strategy, have been spreading through other areas after they were pioneered last year in western Anbar, once the most dangerous province in Iraq. Attacks on such neighborhood police units are not uncommon but Thursday's bold assault was one of the largest of its kind in Baghdad. On November 13, U.S. and Iraqi forces killed an estimated 15 al Qaeda gunmen in a fierce, day-long battle in Adwaniya, just south of Baghdad, after al Qaeda fighters attacked two neighborhood police checkpoints there.
