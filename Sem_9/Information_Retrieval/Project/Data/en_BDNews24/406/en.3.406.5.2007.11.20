 NEW YORK, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World champions Tyson Gay and Allyson Felix were named winners of the 2007 Jesse Owens Award on Monday as the sport's top U.S. athletes, USA Track & Field (USATF) announced. Gay sprinted to 100 and 200 metres world titles and led the U.S. to the 4x100 metres relay gold at the IAAF championships in Osaka, Japan. He also ran the second-fastest 200 metres of all time, 19.62 seconds, at the American championships, where he won the sprint double. "This (award) is the greatest honour of my career," the 25-year-old Gay said in a statement. "Jesse Owens is a hero of mine for many reasons, and to have my name linked with his, and with the great athletes who have been honoured before me, is humbling." Felix, 21, capped an unbeaten 200 metres season by taking the world title. She also played key roles in U.S. victories in the 4x100 and 4x400 metres relays at Osaka. "It is a privilege to receive an award with such a rich tradition," said Felix, who also won the award in 2005. "To be recognised in the company of such great champions is truly an honour." The sprinters will be presented their awards on Dec. 1 at the USATF's annual meeting in Honolulu
