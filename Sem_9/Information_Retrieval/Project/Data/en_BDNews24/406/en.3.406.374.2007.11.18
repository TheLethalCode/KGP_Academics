<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com)  The Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) will submit a damage report on post-Sidr agricultural losses in 10 days, officials said. "The DAE has been asked by the agriculture adviser to submit a detailed report on agricultural losses and a probable rehabilitation programme within the next 10 days," DAE director general Shahidul Alam told bdnews24.com Sunday. Alam said: "We've already asked our field level officials to provide information on losses in a fixed format." The decision to conduct a study was taken at a meeting between agriculture adviser CS Karim and the DAE on Saturday. DAE officials told the adviser the cyclone ravaged 60 percent of the Aman crop across five lakh hectares of land in the coastal districts. In a preliminary estimate DAE officials said that about six lakh tons of Aman crops had been damaged by the cyclone, adding to the existing crop crisis following consecutive flooding in July and August this year. Officials said the south and south-western districts, including Barisal, Pirojpur, Patuakhali, Barguna, Jhalakathi, Bhola, Shariatpur, Gopalganj, Khulna and Bagerhat suffered heavy losses in the Aman crop, vegetables, livestock, fisheries, trees and houses. The government had targeted an Aman yield of 1.3 crore metric tonnes for the current season, but at least 10 lakh metric tonnes had already been damaged in recent floods. So the Aman rice crop loss this year stands at 16 lakh metric tonnes, according to DAE data. Aman accounts for 41 percent of the country's total rice production. The food and disaster management ministry gathered information of losses from deputy commissioners' offices in 24 districts Saturday. According to food and disaster management ministry reports crops on 142,176 acres of land had been totally damaged while crops on 354,850 acres had been partially damaged. The reports said the cyclone left at least 2,61,972 houses flattened while another 3,90,817 had been damaged to some extent. Some 2,42,000 livestock were killed in the storm that levelled at least 50 educational institutions and caused partial damage to another 29,991. The reports estimated that 3.45 lakh trees were uprooted during the cyclone. bd
