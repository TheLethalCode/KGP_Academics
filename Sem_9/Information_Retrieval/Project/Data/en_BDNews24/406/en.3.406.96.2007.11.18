 CAIRO, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Egypt's two main indexes hit new life highs on Sunday as investors returned to buying big caps after the private placement in the real estate developer Talaat Mustafa was 17 times oversubscribed, brokers said. "Foreign investors acquired most of the shares in the private placement, leaving local institutions with high liquidity that returned back today to the market," Essam Khalifa, general manager of the National Fund Management Company, said. The group, which is also offering shares in a separate initial public offering that ends on Tuesday, said on Friday that its private placement of 330 million shares had been 17 times oversubscribed. The shares were sold for 3.83 billion Egyptian pounds ($693.84 million), but investors offered 65 billion pounds. Egypt's benchmark Case 30 index gained 2 percent to 9,599.49 points, while the well-watched Hermes index gained 1.8 percent to 84,485.44 points, both record highs. The broader CIBC index rose 0.9 percent to 394.06 points. "The enthusiasm for the TMG private placement also gave a positive impression on the market as a whole," said Eissa Fathy Eissa, managing director of the Strategic Company for Securitites. bdnews24.com/lq/2151hrs Brokers said the leaps in quarterly profits of big caps also inspired investors.
