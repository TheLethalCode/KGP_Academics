 Dhaka, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com) -- Confidential official documents of 25 years old will be made available to the public from now on, the caretaker government said Sunday. The council of advisers decided that the documents would be archived by using modern technology, the chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim said in a press briefing. The decision means people will be able to access 25-year-old government documents for research and reference. The National Archives ensures official custody of public documents and serves as the central depository of all government records. Until now the documents on all decisions made by the cabinet had been kept under the custody of the cabinet secretary, Munaim said. "From now on the information will be available to everyone," he said. bdnews24.c
