 Dhaka, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com)  Devotees offered special prayers at all mosques countrywide after the Friday congregations for the salvation of thousands killed by Cyclone Sidr. At the Baitul Mokarram National Mosque, special prayers were held under the auspices of the Islamic Foundation, which was attended by religious affairs adviser ASM Matiur Rahman and other senior government officials. Devotees also prayed for early recovery of the injured and the ailing after Sidr slammed into southern districts with 15-feet storm surges. "The recent disaster not only befell the southerners, it affected us all in more than one ways. Pray and ask of Allah to renew our strength and morale, please," the advisers said to the congregation. "May Allah bless the deceased and strengthen the alive so that they may join the reconstruction in the south ravaged by cyclone with bolstered capacities," he said. Shafique Ibn Shameem, a student, said to bdnews24.com, "I've come here today to pray for the countless people who were killed in the recent storm." On Nov 15, the tropical cyclone ripped through 15 southern districts whipping up monstrous surges, annihilating thousands and wreaking massive destruction. bdne
