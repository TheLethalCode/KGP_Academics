 Sanjay Dey bdnews24.com Correspondent Taltali (Barguna), November 20 (bdnews24.com)  An atmosphere of hopelessness pervades the union of Karhaibarhia near Taltali town, with the unbearable odour of death rising from the many as yet unburied victims of the Nov 15 mega-cyclone. Mile after mile of devastated crop fields remain scattered with decomposing human corpses and dead livestock. Many survivors of the hurricane winds and enormous storm surge are still searching for their missing family and friends, five days after Cyclone Sidr struck southern Bangladesh. "I lost my son and all my belongings. I can't tell you now how we managed to climb a tamarind tree when the water tore into our house," Moharjan, 50, told bdnews24.com on her way to collect relief with her grandson. Abdul Jalil from Naya Bhaijra said he lost his mother on the night of the storm. Her body was later discovered in a field three kilometers from their home. Many locals say they cannot even locate the exact site of their former homes. So complete was the destruction. In some cases, all traces of their former lives have simply been obliterated, with occasional traces of raised ground where houses once stood. Community healer Ruhul Amin from Naya Bhaijra said: "I clung to a Tamarind tree with my family, which includes a four-day-old boy. I think trees like ours played a huge part in saving the lives of countless people that night." Nevertheless, many locals say even large trees that people have sheltered in were swept away in the hurricane force winds and accompanying tidal surge. Uprooted trees, which commonly line rural roads, proved to be a major obstacle to communication following the storm. Brick-paved roads were largely washed away with the impact of rushing water, and many earthen roads have been dug up in places to allow the flooded land to drain. "It's no use asking people what they lost, or how many family members are gone. Let me tell you, people here died like shrimp fry," said Liton, owner of a motorcycle taxi. Five days after the cyclone, most areas surrounding Amtali show no signs of receiving government relief, reported Maruf Raihan, from local NGO Payra Development Foundation. The scale of the destruction and human suffering is enormous. bdnews24.com reported the story of Abdul Khaleque from Kavirajparha yesterday, when 15 members of his family had been confirmed dead. The death toll from this one family has since risen to 22, with one still missing. The nearby Tentulbarhia family lost nine of its members. Fakirhat River Port, once a busy fish drying and trading centre, now looks like a cemetery. Large fishing trawlers were lifted from the river, landing like toys on the 10 ft high embankment. "The tidal bore took us by surprise, it swept away everything in minutes that we had carefully stored over years," said Mostafa Hossain, a local grocer. "Still, we are thankful to Allah that we're alive," he added. Boatman and fish trader Md Aslam said: "Before the storm I went fishing for 13 days, and caught the best catch of my life. This cyclone has ruined me. I lost dried fish worth Tk 4 lakh." Ashar Char itself has been razed to the ground, leaving only six out of the 500 fishermen's huts in ruins, with the others buried under a thick layer of sand. Alamgir Hossain, who lives on the sandbar said: "About 5,000 people lived here, now it is deserted. I buried a child this morning, and many dead bodies are still rotting in the forest." "Many people have come in the last three or four days looking for their families," Hossain said. bdnews24.com/snd/ra
