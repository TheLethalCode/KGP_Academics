 SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Egypt offered broad support on Tuesday for peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians in the United States next week but again pressed for a firm timetable for setting up a Palestinian state. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak endorsed the meeting at a joint news conference with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who is looking for wide Arab participation in the Annapolis conference called by US President George W Bush. "I look forward to it (the conference) leading to the launching of serious peace negotiations which deal with all final status issues in a defined timeframe and according to an agreed follow-up mechanism," Mubarak said. "I look forward to constructive positions from Prime Minister Olmert, which would contribute to ... making the coming meeting a success," he added. Mubarak did not confirm definitively that Egypt will send a delegation to Annapolis or will encourage other Arab governments to take part in the meeting. Arab foreign ministers are meeting in Cairo on Friday to take a common position on the peace conference. Some Arab countries might not attend unless they see more progress in preparatory Israeli-Palestinian talks, diplomats say. But Egypt and Jordan, the two Arab countries which have signed peace treaties with the Jewish state, are expected to go to Annapolis, probably at the level of foreign ministers. On Monday, Olmert made a bid for wide Arab support for the conference by agreeing to release 441 Palestinian prisoners and reaffirming a pledge not to build new Jewish settlements. But Olmert, speaking before a two-hour meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, did not say whether he would agree to U.S. and Palestinian demands to halt all construction in existing settlements in the occupied West Bank. DETAILED TIMETABLE On Tuesday, Olmert said he welcomed Egyptian support for the Annapolis conference but played down expectations that the meeting would lead to quick results. "The fact that ... the leader of such an important Arab state which is Egypt, led by President Mubarak, gives his backing ... is proof of its success," he said. "The negotiations are not simple. After 60 years, is it possible to sit down in one go and in a week solve our problems? ... But I am optimistic that if we act responsibly there is a chance we can achieve an agreement," he added. Diplomats and officials say the chances of a detailed agreement in Annapolis are small and the most to expect is a framework for arrangements for future Israeli-Palestinian talks. The Arabs had wanted much more, especially a detailed timetable for setting up the Palestinian state which the United States has advocated since early in Bush's presidency. Olmert said there would be no progress until the Palestinians fulfil their obligations under the 2003 "road map", including in Gaza, which is under Hamas control. Israel is negotiating with Abbas, whose sway is limited to the West Bank. Olmert and Mubarak also talked about Israeli demands that Egypt do more to prevent the smuggling of arms and ammunition across the Egyptian border with Gaza. Mubarak defended Egypt's record, saying it would not allow arms to enter Sinai or Gaza and that Egyptian forces had recently confiscated large amounts of weaponry. Olmert said he and Mubarak had set what he called joint action paradigms to prevent attacks on Israel from Ga
