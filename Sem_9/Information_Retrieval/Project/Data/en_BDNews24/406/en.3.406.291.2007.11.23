 PATUAKHALI, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com)  The residents of Char Heyar battled the elements and struggled to stay alive, bdnews24.com's Sanjay Dey said Thursday. Char Kalagachhia, officially Char Heyar, some 50 miles off Galachipa, is one of the worst affected areas in the southern district of Patuakhali. The storm damage was so great that residents of nearby Galachipa say Go to Kalagachhia if you want to see the devastation. Dey travelled for six hours amid rolling waves to reach the devastated land. "As we got off the trawler, we found ourselves amidst dead bodies," he said. Putrid odour gripped the area like a vice. Only bones remained after crows had done their work. Shopkeeper Huq Miah, 25, said: "On the night of the storm, I clung to the top of a Keoda tree along with my wife and baby. This saved us." Pointing to a mound of earth, he said: "That is where my house once stood. Nothing remains of it now." Barely a trace remains of Char Kalagachhia's 500 houses. The most fearful news came from local farmer Abdur Rashid Howladar, 50. He showed a raised mound saying: "The place you see was the homestead of Salam Khan. Nobody on the sandbar thought that this strong house would be washed away by the storm. That was why, on the night of storm, about 200 people took shelter in that house." "They perished with the house." The family members of Salam Khan were on the rooftop. Those few who were higher up survived the tidal deluge. The bdnews24.com correspondent was reluctant to believe the story. But in a swamp flanking a side of the house, he found a picture tube from Salam's television. Residents confirmed the truth of the story. They explained that the house was something of a local landmark. The television was the only means for residents to know about doings in the world beyond. Fishermen from various places would converge on this house to get weather reports. Salam Khan had escaped the storm, taking refuge in Rangabali, 10 kilometres away. About 50 storm survivors rushed to Dey, thinking he had come to coordinate relief work. Aleya Begum, 40, was one of them. Her husband Abdur Rob was killed on the night of the storm. Aleya said: "Sir, please write down my name. After the flood, army personnel gave me puffed rice and 5 kg of rice. I have no hearth and home. I cannot bear the cold at night. I have nothing left except for the clothes I am wearing." Dey's explanation that he was a journalist did not diminish their hope that he could still help them. Ataul Sardar said, "Please convey our condition to the government." "There is no embankment around the char. About two years ago we told the union council chairman to raise a high mound. If that had been raised, more would have lived. We could have sheltered men and buffalos there." "Now we have nothing." The standard question: why did you not evacuate the place, left Dey feeling insensitive. They replied in unison, "Where would we go?" It takes two hours by trawler to reach the nearest cyclone shelter. On the night of storm, Char Kalagachhia residents died by the hundreds. Twelve bodies recovered from the deep Keoda forest Wednesday were later buried with help from Red Crescent workers. Jasim Howladar of Uttarpara, Rangabali helped lay the victims to rest. He had come to Char Kalagachhia to fish. Jasim said, "I saw many bodies in the Keoda forest yesterday (Wednesday)." "There is no way to identify them. We carried those bodies which could be lifted off the ground." "Red Crescent workers spread medicines on those bodies and then they were put into the earth." Residents say they would not enter the forest now. Fear, they say, haunts them after the storm. bdnews24.com/
