 Dhaka, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission said Thursday it would make a decision within two days on whether to appeal the High Court's stay order on dialogue with acting BNP secretary general Hafizuddin Ahmed. "We will take the decision regarding the High Court's stay order in a day or two," election commissioner Sohul Hossain told reporters in his office. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda had earlier said the commission would not sit with Hafizuddin Thursday, as had been planned, in view of the stay order. Hafizuddin represents the Saifur-led faction of the BNP. "We will wait until the court resolves the matter and discuss the issue with the attorney general," Huda said Monday. Earlier, the HC halted the EC's electoral dialogue invitation to Hafizuddin for four weeks after BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia filed a writ petition. bdnew
