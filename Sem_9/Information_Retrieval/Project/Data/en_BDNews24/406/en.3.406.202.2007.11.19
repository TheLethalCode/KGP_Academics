 MUMBAI, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India batsman Yuvraj Singh has been fined 20 percent of his match fee after being found guilty of breaching the code of conduct during Sunday's one-day defeat to Pakistan, the International Cricket Council said. Left-handed Yuvraj was controversially given out caught behind off pacer Umar Gul by umpire Suresh Shastri for 50 but the in-form batsman, adjudged player of the series, stood his ground and indicated that the ball had grazed his shoulder. The player was charged for showing dissent at an umpire's decision, the statement said on Monday. Pakistan went on to win the contest by 31 runs, although India won the five-match series 3-2. The first test of a three-match series between the sides begins in New Delhi on Thursday
