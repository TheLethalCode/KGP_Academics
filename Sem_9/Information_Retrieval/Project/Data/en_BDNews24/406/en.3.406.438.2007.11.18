 CENTURION, South Africa, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Dale Steyn bowled South Africa to a resounding series win over New Zealand in the second test on Sunday. South Africa won by an innings and 59 runs in the seventh over after tea on the third day to sweep the series 2-0. The hosts won the first test in Johannesburg by 358 runs, South Africa's biggest win and New Zealand's heaviest defeat in terms of runs. Steyn, who took match figures of 10-93 in the first test and 4-42 in the first innings in Centurion, claimed 6-49 in the second innings. Steyn's haul of 10-91 was his career-best performance in a test. New Zealand, who needed 195 to make South Africa bat again, were bowled out for 136 in their second innings with Stephen Fleming's 54 their top score. Fast bowler Mark Gillespie took 5-136 as South Africa were dismissed for 383 in their only innings. Gillespie's performance made him the fifth New Zealander to take five wickets on debut. Hashim Amla, who scored 176 not out in the first test in Johannesburg, added another century with a disciplined 103. Amla's patient innings ended when he drove uppishly at a delivery from medium pacer Iain O'Brien and was caught by a diving Michael Papps in the covers. New Zealand's progress was held up by a spirited stand of 51 for the ninth wicket between Steyn and Andre Nel, who both scored 25. The visitors slipped to 9-2 in their second innings when Steyn trapped Lou Vincent (4) and Papps (1) in front. Fleming and Scott Styris consolidated in a stand of 60 that ended when Styris, who scored 29, edged a ball from fast bowler Jacques Kallis to AB de Villiers at second slip. New Zealand were 78-4 in the eighth over before tea when Ross Taylor was run out for eight by Amla's flick on to the stumps from short leg. Fleming and Brendon McCullum nursed New Zealand to tea on 110-4 but Steyn had Fleming leg-before in the third over of the last session. In Steyn's next over McCullum (21) edged to Graeme Smith at first slip and Gillespie (0) steered a catch to Kallis at second slip. Steyn ended the match by splaying O'Brien's stumps
