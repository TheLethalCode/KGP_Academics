 DHAKA, Nov 21 (bdnews24.com) -- A Dhaka court Wednesday set Nov 28 to frame charges against detained former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, sister Sheikh Rehana and Awami League leader Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim in an extortion case filed by a businessman. The charge-framing will set off the trial of the three. Dhaka metropolitan sessions judge Azizul Haque set the date and ordered that Hasina and Selim be produced in court on Nov 28. Rehana was shown as a fugitive in the case chargesheet. Azam Jahangir Chowdhury, managing director of Eastcoast Trading, filed a Tk 2.99 crore extortion case on June 13 with Gulshan Police Station. In case details, Azam alleged that he had paid the accused Tk 2.99 crore in bribes to obtain a contract to set up a power plant in Siddhirganj, Narayanganj. Rehana was not initially accused by Azam. Rehana, who was later indicted in the case on the basis of confessional statement of Selim, faces an arrest order. She lives in London. bdnew
