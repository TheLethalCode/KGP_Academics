 LONDON, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Steve McClaren was sacked as England head coach on Thursday following their failure to qualify for the European Championship finals next year, Sky Sports News reported. The Football Association had still not made an official statement but McClaren's 19-month reign in charge appeared over following the 3-2 defeat by Croatia at Wembley. A Football Association statement was to be made at 0945 GMT. England needed just a draw against Croatia to seal a place in Euro 2008 but defeat means they will be missing from a major finals for the first time since the 1994 World Cup. A 12-man FA board met from 0830 GMT for an emergency meeting on Thursday to discuss McClaren's future. The under-fire coach had said on Wednesday he would not resign. McClaren took over from Swede Sven-Goran Eriksson after last year's World Cup finals in Germany where England reached the quarter-finals. Speculation is now turning to who the FA will choose to lead the qualification for the 2010 World Cup which begins next year. Former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho was quoted as 7-2 favourite with British bookmakers
