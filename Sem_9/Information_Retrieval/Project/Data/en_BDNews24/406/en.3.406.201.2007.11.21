<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 21 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Wednesday ruled illegal the notice the Anticorruption Commission had served on detained former prime minister Sheikh Hasina for accounts of her assets. The bench of justices Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Zubayer Rahman Chowdhury issued the verdict after hearing the writ petition Hasina had filed challenging the legality of the notice. The antigraft watchdog served the Awami League chief with the notice on July 17, a day after security forces arrested her. The court on Aug 7 halted the efficacy of the ACC notice following the writ petition.
