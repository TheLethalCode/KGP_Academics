 RIYADH, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad brands US dollar `a worthless piece of paper. said on Sunday his country would not use oil as a weapon even if it is attacked by the United States over Tehran's disputed nuclear program. But suggested an end to the trading of oil in US dollars, calling the currency `a worthless piece of paper'. The call came at the end of a rare Opec summit, and was opposed by US ally Saudi Arabia. "We would never like to use oil as a weapon ... there are other means at our disposal to respond," Ahmadinejad told a news conference held after a summit of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. His remarks were translated into English from Persian. Washington has not ruled out military action against Iran, accusing it of seeking nuclear weapons. Tehran says its nuclear programme is peaceful. Ahmadinejad said Iran would study a Gulf Arab proposal to set up a body in a neutral country such as Switzerland that would provide enriched uranium to Middle East users including Iran and ensure it is used for peaceful purposes only. "We will closely and positively study (the proposal)," Ahmadinejad said. Iran has welcomed the plan but said it would not halt uranium enrichment on its own territory. Gulf countries -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates -- share Western concerns over Iran's nuclear energy programme. Ahmadinejad said OPEC leaders had discussed a decline in the value of the dollar at the two-day summit. "Today all leaders were unhappy with the fall in the value (of the dollar) ... even the American people have lost out," Ahmadinejad said, adding that only "a handful of capitalists" benefited from the US currency's slide. "They get our oil and give us a worthless piece of paper," he said. The Iranian president had wanted to include the attack on the dollar in the summit's closing statement. The communique made little mention of the dollar, however, focusing instead on energy security and the environment. The summit in Saudi Arabia was only Opec's third in 47 years. During the talks, Opec members revealed differences about the future direction of the exporters' group. But Opec leaders ended with a pledge to provide the world with reliable supplies of oil. Speaking after the end of the summit, Mr Ahmadinejad said all leaders at the meeting were unhappy with recent falls in the value of the dollar. The dollar has weakened considerably against the euro and other currencies in the past 12 months. Its decline has affected the revenues of Opec members because most of them price and sell their oil exports in the US currency. Mr Ahmadinejad said that all Opec countries had showed interest in converting their cash reserves into other currencies. "They [the US] get our oil and give us a worthless piece of paper," he told reporters. But Saudi officials were against including any such language in the declaration. One is reported to have warned that it could add to the pressure on the doll
