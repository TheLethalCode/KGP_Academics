 LONDON, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British water utility Kelda Group said it had received a 3 billion pound ($6.2 billion) takeover approach from a consortium of infrastructure investment firms, sending its shares almost 15 percent higher. Kelda, which owns Yorkshire Water, said the consortium comprised Citigroup Alternative Investments, GIC Special Investments, Infracapital Partners and HSBC and indicated it would offer 1,100.65 pence per Kelda ordinary share, comprising cash and an interim dividend. Kelda said there was no certainty an offer will be made. The cost of insuring Kelda's debt against default in the credit derivatives market soared. Five-year credit default swaps on the company rose as much as 45 basis points to 90 basis points, according to Deutsche Bank prices, before dropping back to 80 basis points.

Reuters reported earlier that there was talk of a bid for the firm. Kelda shares were up 14.6 percent 1,074 pence at 1538 G
