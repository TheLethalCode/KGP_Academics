 ISLAMABAD, Fri Nov 23, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, the man President Pervez Musharraf deposed, is set to return to Pakistan within days, an aide said on Friday. Overnight the Commonwealth suspended Pakistan's membership of the grouping of mostly former British colonies, in a move that underlined the pressure General Musharraf has been under since imposing emergency rule three weeks ago. Sharif was due to meet Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah on Friday in Riyadh, just days after Musharraf paid a surprise visit to the monarch amid speculation he was reaching out to his opponent to shore up his support base ahead of a January 8 general election. "Nawaz Sharif is meeting Saudi King Abdullah today and will announce his schedule after that. God willing, he will return in a few days," Raja Zafar-ul-Haq, chairman of the Nawaz League as Sharif's faction of the Pakistan Muslim League is known, told Reuters. However it was not immediately clear whether Sharif, whom Musharraf deposed in a bloodless 1999 coup, would get back before November 26, the last date for filing election nominations, and so be able to run for parliament. Ahsan Iqbal, a spokesman for Sharif's party, said he was expected to return "within four or five days". Musharraf imposed a two-term limit on the prime ministership in 2002, which currently bars both Sharif and opposition leader Benazir Bhutto from another term.

Sharif said he had had no contact with Musharraf or his aides during his Saudi visit this week. RE-ELECTION RULED VALID A Supreme Court packed with government-friendly judges finally gave Musharraf satisfaction on Thursday, ruling that his October 6 re-election by parliament had been valid. He is now expected to quit the army and be sworn in for a second five-year term as a civilian. The Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG), meeting in Uganda on Thursday, suspended Pakistan's membership "pending the restoration of democracy and the rule of law in that country", Secretary-General Don McKinnon told a news conference in Kampala. Musharraf has already started to roll back the emergency, releasing some 5,000 opposition activists and lawyers rounded up after it was imposed on November 3. Private TV channel ARYone World resumed broadcasting on Friday after it was suspended along with a number of others amid stiff media curbs. Several top judges and lawyers whose interpretation of the law posed the most serious challenge to Musharraf's authority remain either in prison or under house arrest. Former prime minister Bhutto, who Musharraf allowed back to Pakistan last month, flew to Islamabad from the southern city of Karachi on Friday, in order to file her nomination papers for the election.
