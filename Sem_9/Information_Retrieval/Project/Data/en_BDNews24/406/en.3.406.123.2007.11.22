<TITLE> Japan PM to meet opposition on parliament deadlock </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's prime minister was set to meet opposition leaders on Thursday over a deadlock in parliament that has halted a naval mission in support of US-led operations in Afghanistan, but prospects of a breakthrough appeared slim. Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda's talks with Democratic Party leader Ichiro Ozawa will be the first since the two met on Nov. 2 and sparked political turmoil by discussing a grand coalition to cope with a divided parliament. Democratic Party executives rejected the proposed coalition, prompting Ozawa to tender his resignation -- only to reverse course and agree to stay on after party lawmakers, fearing he might defect, begged him to stay. Fukuda sought Thursday's meetings with all opposition leaders to report on his talks with Asian leaders in Singapore and on his summit last Friday with US President George W Bush. But the standoff in parliament, where the Democrats and smaller opposition parties control the upper house and can delay legislation, would also be in the agenda. "I think he will also want to talk about the management of parliament and ask them to cooperate in passing bills," Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobutaka Machimura told a news conference. Fukuda and his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) may well want to show openness to dialogue with the opposition as a prelude to taking a tougher stance, some political analysts said. The government has been unable to enact any major laws since Fukuda took office in September after his predecessor Shinzo Abe suddenly quit. Speculation is simmering that Fukuda may call a snap election for the more powerful lower house. "There is no system or procedure to make laws in this 'twisted' parliament and politicians are struggling," said Toru Umemoto, chief forex strategist at Barclays Cappital. "The LDP will have to do something, and this is a first trial." Parliament's session is set to end on Dec. 15 but the ruling bloc will need to extend that, perhaps into January, if it wants to use its two-thirds majority in the lower house to override an upper house rejection of a bill to resume the naval mission. Ozawa on Tuesday reiterated his opposition to Japan's refueling mission in the Indian Ocean, where its navy for the past six years had been refueling US and other vessels patrolling for drug smugglers and suspected terrorists. Fukuda promised Bush that he would do all he could to restart the mission, halted on Nov. 1 when an enabling law expired. But the efforts are being complicated by opposition probing of a defence ministry scandal to which Finance Minister Fukushiro Nukaga has been linked. Nukaga has denied any wrongdoing. Fukuda will meet Akihiro Ota, head of coalition partner New Komeito party, ahead of his talks with the oppositi
