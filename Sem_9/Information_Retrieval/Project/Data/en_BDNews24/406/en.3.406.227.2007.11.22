<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com)  The government has decided to offload 25 percent shares of Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company on to the capital market. The advisory council committee on economic affairs at a meeting held at the Cabinet Division Thursday decided to float the stakes of the state-owned gas company. "We expect all official processes regarding the Titas Gas shares sale to complete in the next two to three months. The relevant ministry and the Securities and Exchange Commission will execute the necessary tasks," finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said to reporters. The price of each share has not yet been fixed, Mirza said. Asked why the Titas shares would be floated on the stock market, Azizul said, "It will help the company to get over the losses and institute public ownership of government enterprises." The adviser said a ministerial meeting on Aug 31, 2005 had recommended 49 percent of Titas shares for the share market. Thursday's meeting, however, approved a proposal of the energy and mineral resources ministry to float 25 percent of the company's shares, he added. The meeting also decided that the ongoing study to find a site for a deep seaport would continue. PCI Company from Japan, an international consultancy firm, is overseeing the task. "The meeting discussed whether to cancel the study contract and discontinue the site-fixing study considering the high costs of the project and the long time it needs for implementation." "Now, cancelling the study contract would mean compensating the contractee paying even a larger amount than the total allocation for the same. "The Japanese firm has so far been paid Tk 5 crore and the government will have to pay another Tk 13 crore in case the contract is cancelled," the adviser said. The total government allocation for the study was fixed at Tk 13 crore. The meeting also discussed a number of other issues including Muslin Cotton Mills liquidation proposal and import of fertilisers from the UAE and Qatar. bdnews24.com/
