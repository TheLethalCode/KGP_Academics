 BUJUMBURA, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rebels belonging to Burundi's last active guerrilla group are holding two police officers they want exchanged for their fighters detained in prisons across the country, a rebel spokesman said on Friday. The Forces for National Liberation (FNL) seized the head of intelligence services in the northwestern province of Cibitoke and a Bujumbura-based police investigator on Thursday. "This is a message to the government so that it thinks about freeing hundreds of our prisoners who are suffering in different jails," said FNL spokesman Pasteur Habimana. "The hostages will be immediately released once the government responds to our demand," he told Reuters by telephone from the Tanzanian city of Dar Es Salaam. Government officials were not immediately available for comment, but a police spokesman accused FNL rebels of breaking a peace deal signed in September last year. Talks to implement the peace agreement have been suspended since July, when FNL rebels walked out of a truce monitoring team. The rebels said they would rejoin the team once the South African chief mediator, Charles Nqakula is replaced. They accused Nqakula of bias, an allegation he has denied. The African Union has urged the government and the FNL to finish their talks by the end of the year. The FNL's persistent insurgency is seen as the final barrier for lasting stability in the coffee-growing nation of 8 million people.
