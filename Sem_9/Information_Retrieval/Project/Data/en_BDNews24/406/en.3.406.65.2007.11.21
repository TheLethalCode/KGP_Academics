 ISLAMABAD, Nov 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan has called on the Commonwealth to delay a decision whether to suspend its membership of the 53-nation grouping because of the imposition of emergency rule, a foreign ministry spokesman said on Wednesday. The Commonwealth, mainly comprising former British colonies, had set Thursday as a deadline for President Pervez Musharraf to revoke the state of emergency he imposed on Nov. 3 or face suspension. The Commonwealth's ministerial action group (CMAG) will meet in the Ugandan capital Kampala on Thursday to discuss the issue. Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Sadiq told a weekly briefing caretaker Prime Minister Mohammadmian Soomro spoke to British counterpart, Gordon Brown on Tuesday night, and also wrote to CMAG heads, saying that the political situation in Pakistan was returning to normal.

Soomro was appointed last week to oversee an interim government until an election set for Jan. 8. Pakistan was suspended from Commonwealth councils in 1999 following a coup that brought General Musharraf to power, but was reinstated to full membership in 2004.

There is every chance of Musharraf being sworn in as a civilian president later this week once a court, packed with government friendly judges, strikes down challenges to his re-election by parliament last month while still army chief. But the Commonwealth has many more complaints against Musharraf since he opted for emergency rule. Among other measures demanded are the restoration of the constitution, and for immediate progress to be made on holding free and fair elections. The Commonwealth had also sought the release of all detainees held since the emergency was announced. On Tuesday, in a sign that the emergency was being relaxed, Pakistan said it had released most of more than 5,000 detained lawyers, opposition and rights activists, and a remaining 2,000 would be freed soon. CMAG was established in 1995 to deal with serious or persistent violations of Commonwealth rules on democra
