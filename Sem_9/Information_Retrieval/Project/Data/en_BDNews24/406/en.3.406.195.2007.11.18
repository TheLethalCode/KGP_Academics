<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com)  Food and disaster management adviser Tapan Chowdhury Sunday said he welcomed political parties joining post-Sidr relief operations. "This is the time to stand beside afflicted humanity. The government will welcome any political party that takes part in the ongoing rescue and relief operations," the adviser told reporters at the secretariat. "In the past, students always led the way in helping disaster victims. We hope they do not fall behind this time and keep up the tradition." The adviser did not offer storm damage estimates, saying, "We'll get accounts after our workers reach every corner of the affected area." He said relief workers were not able to reach all the storm-hit areas because communication systems had been critically damaged. He said the government had launched an all-out effort to repair the communication infrastructure. The adviser said he hoped the power supply would be normalised in a day or two. bdnews24.com/ahd-ehb
