 Bangladesh EN DHAKA, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com) -- Dhaka University Thursday decided to cut course fees from Tk 250 to Tk 100 after students under the semester system protested the fee hike. The decision came from a meeting chaired by DU vice-chancellor Prof SMA Faiz. The acting dean of the social sciences faculty, AAMS Arefin Siddique, told bdnews24.com that the fees for each course had been decreased to Tk 100 in line with demand by protesting students. The DU also decided to extend the deadline for applications for exams but made no decision to reduce tuition fees yet, he said. Thursday was the deadline for applications. In line with the old system, students paid Tk 3,000 in admission fees and Tk 350 in course final exams fees for full year. But the students, according to the new rules, have to pay Tk 2,500 in fees for final exams and Tk 8,400 in admission fees in two semesters per year. Students are required to sign up for a six-month semester twice a year under the new rules. bdnew
