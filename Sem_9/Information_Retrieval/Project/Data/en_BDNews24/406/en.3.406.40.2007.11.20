 DAMASCUS, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Syria resisted international pressure and insisted on Tuesday it would only attend a US-hosted Middle East peace conference next week if the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights are on the agenda. "The Golan must be on the schedule for Syria to participate. We are very interested in peace but the process should be comprehensive," Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister Fayssal Mekdad said after meeting his Russian counterpart Alexander Sultanov. Syria has come under pressure by Russia and pro-US Arab governments to attend the conference in Annapolis, Maryland, even if the Golan is not explicitly on the agenda. Arab foreign ministers are due to meet in Cairo on Thursday to discuss a common strategy at the conference.

An Arab diplomat expected Syria to attend at the last moment. "Syria knows that Annapolis is vital to lessen its isolation and improve damaged ties with Arab counties that have strong ties with Washington," he said. Official invitations for the Nov. 26-27 conference are expected to be issued later on Tuesday. Syria will be among the Arab countries receiving an invitation, Western diplomats in Damascus said. US officials have said they plan to include key Arab States, including Syria and Saudi Arabia, which do not have diplomatic relations with Israel. Israel and Syria last held peace talks in 2000 but failed to reach an agreement on the future of the Golan Heights, a fertile plateau which Israel captured from Syria in 19
