 LONDON/ASHGABAT, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Energy Secretary Sam Bodman questioned Turkmenistan's support for a US-backed gas pipeline to Europe skirting Russia, while the Turkmen leader also suggested he favoured another route supported by Moscow. Bodman, who met Turkmen President Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov last week in Ashgabat, said on Tuesday he was not convinced that the Caspian country would fully support the project that would take gas to Europe without crossing Russian territory. "I came away with question marks," Bodman told a British-U.S. business group in London. "Turkmenistan has enormous amounts of gas, the question is whether the president is prepared to see the investment needed to run it across the Caspian." Berdymukhamedov was meanwhile quoted in Turkmenistan on Tuesday as saying he was committed to the Moscow-backed pipeline project that would send gas to Europe across Russian territory. "Honouring its obligations, Turkmenistan will continue its efforts to promote the Caspian Gas Pipeline project," state media quoted him as saying. Turkmenistan plans to more than triple its gas production by 2030 from this year's planned 80 billion cubic metres of gas. It now relies on a Russian-controlled pipeline network for its exports but has been thinking of diversifying supply routes. A trans-Caspian pipeline would get Turkmen gas to Europe through Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey. The gas would then flow through another non-Russian pipeline -- Nabucco -- across Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and into Austria. "This is not an anti-Russian policy. Each country should have a diversity of suppliers," Bodman said. Turkmenistan's support for the Russian-backed scheme has appeared to be on hold due to disagreements over gas prices. Russia and Turkmenistan, Central Asia's top gas supplier, had been due to finalise the deal in September, but have so far failed to agree on the price of supplies. The proposed pipeline would have a capacity of 10 to 20 billion cubic metres a year. A source close to the negotiations told Reuters the pipeline issue would dominate Berdymukhamedov's talks on Thursday and Friday with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov, who is due to visit the country. Competition between the West, China and Russia for control over Turkmen gas has intensified since the December death of Turkmenistan's absolute ruler Saparmurat Niyazov, who showed little interest in energy diplomacy during his 21-year rule. The country is also working on a pipeline to China. Some analysts have questioned Turkmenistan's ability to go ahead with so many projects at the same time. The country has yet to disclose an independent audit of its gas fiel
