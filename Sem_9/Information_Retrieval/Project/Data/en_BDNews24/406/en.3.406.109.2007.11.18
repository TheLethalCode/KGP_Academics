 Dhaka, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com) - The batsmen enjoyed the first day of the fifth round four-dayer of the Ispahani Mirzapore Tea Ninth National Cricket League Sunday. National discard Tushar Imran smashed the unbeaten century as league leaders Khulna stole the show against Barisal to end the day with a comfortable 312 for six at Shaheen Chandhu Stadium in Bogra. Away at Bir Shrestha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium in Chittagong, the hosts were also in a good position to score 289 for nine at stumps riding on a ton by Gazi Salahuddin. Farhad Reza, Khaled Mashud and Musfiqur Rahman continued their superb forms as Rajshahi left the first day with a smile face making 257 for five at stumps against Dhaka at Rajshahi Divisional Stadium. Khulna vs Barisal Put in to bat first, Khulna fell into trouble losing both openers Nazmus Sadat (3) and Imrul Kayes (0), who hit back to back century in the third round, and it became more difficult when one-down Habibul Bashar (13) retired hurt. However, Tushar Imran put on 110 runs along with Saqib Al Hasan (81), third fifty in the league, for the third wicket and added another 80 runs for the fourth wicket with Mostafizur Rahman, who scored 29. Afterwards, Khulna faced a little collapse losing Sahagir Hossain Pavel (1) and Mashrafee Bin Mortaza (17). Tushar who remained unbeaten on 122 off 244 balls featured 20 fours along with Ziaur Rahman (20) when the bails were drawn for Day 1. Taking two Khulna wickets, Talha Jubair joined the top wicket-taker and his teammate left-handed Sajedul Islam, who raised his tally to 23 grabbing the wicket of Imrul Kayes Sunday. Chittagong vs Sylhet Ehsanul Haq's decision to bat first seemed wrong when Chittagong tottered at 30 for two losing both wickets to Rashidur Rahman. Opener Gazi Salahuddin and Aftab Ahmed provided stiff resistance to put on 101 runs for the third wicket before Aftab (46) was bowled by Nabil Samad, who broke Chittagong middle order to return with four for 60. Salahuddin added another 57 for the fourth wicket with his skipper Ehsanul (30), but saw his side slip to 285 for eight from 188 for four facing some tight bowling from Sylhet bowlers. Salahuddin was the ninth Chittagong batsman out for 138 off 269 that included 17 fours and one six. Kamrul Islam and Saju Datta remained unbeaten on eight and seven. Rajshahi vs Dhaka After being put in to bat first, Rajshahi openers Jahurul Islam and Junaed Siddique looked well settled before both batsmen fell on identical 18, leaving the side at 49 for two. Farhad Reza along with Nayeem Islam (19) produced some resistance to put on 39 runs and added another 36 runs for the fourth wicket before Reza was the fourth Rajshahi batsman out for 55, his third fifty in the league. However, Khaled Mashud and Mushfiqur Rahman played a significant 124 in the fifth wicket as Mushfiqur completed his league's third fifty to be out for 65 off 102 clubbing six fours and one six. Mashud (68), fourth fifty in the league, remained unbeaten hitting 10 fours along with Alamgir Kabir (2).
