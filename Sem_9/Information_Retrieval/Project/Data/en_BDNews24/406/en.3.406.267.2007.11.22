 Dhaka, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Under-19 team took an overall 73-run lead against their Pakistani counterparts at the close of the third day of the lone four-dayer at National Stadium Karachi Thursday. Bangladesh were 58 for three at stumps in the second innings after top order batsmen Tamim Iqbal (6), Ashraful Aziz (11) and Mithun Ali (30) returned to the dressing room. Mahmudul Hasan (8) and Rubel Hossain (0) will resume the fourth and final day Friday. With an overnight total of 214 for one, Pakistan Under-19s showed signs of amassing a big total, but the Bangladeshi bowlers finally restricted them to 328 all out, taking a slim first innings lead of 15 runs. Rubel (3/77), Mahmudul (2/41) and Suhrawardi Shuvo (2/42) damaged the opponents innings. Bangladesh posted 343 runs in the first innings riding on a 107-run knock from Rony Talukdar.
