<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com)  Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Monday dismissed fears that the cyclone and the preceding floods would put huge strains on the economy. "Money will be injected into rural economy. We hope we will be able to recover the losses," Azizul told reporters after a meeting on the financial situation in the state-owned banks and their credit disbursement and recovery at the finance ministry. The adviser said the floods and the cyclone had damaged the agricultural sector that account for only 23 percent of GDP. "Aman crops have been damaged by the recent cyclone but it is not a major crop in Bangladesh," Azizul said. He refused to acknowledge that Aman met 41 percent of the rice demand, saying it was not correct. On the financial losses inflicted by the cyclone, he said, "It is too early to estimate." The meeting discussed the overall capital situation in the state-owned banks, credit disbursement and loan rescheduling in coastal belts. "We have decided to reschedule agriculture loan in coastal areas so that there remains no barrier for approving new loans," Azizul said. He said all banks had been asked to immediately make farm loans available. He, however, said they did not discuss writing off loans or waiver of interest on farm loans. Azizul said the state-owned banks were facing capital deficits. "I have asked the banks to raise their capital immediately as they have recently been converted to public limited companies." Senior Bangladesh Bank and finance ministry officials and managing directors of state-owned Sonali, Janata, Agrani banks and Bangladesh Krishi Bank attended the meeting.
