 BRUSSELS, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - There is a smaller chance that Turkey's military will push into northern Iraq to strike at Kurdish PKK rebels because of improved cooperation between Baghdad and Ankara, Iraq's foreign minister said on Tuesday. As Hoshiyar Zebari spoke in Brussels, two top US generals were in Ankara to discuss sharing intelligence with Turkey's military on PKK rebel movements in northern Iraq as part of Washington's drive to avert a major Turkish incursion. "The danger is still there, to be honest ... but I think the chances of a major invasion are less now," Zebari told reporters before meeting EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana. Zebari said the threat had declined because of improved cooperation between Turkey and Iraq on securing the border. Iraq's Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) has set up roadblocks to stop the flow of food and fuel to rebels of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), who use Iraq's mountainous north as a launchpad for attacks on southern Turkey. But Turkish Foreign Minister Ali Babacan, also in Brussels for talks tied to Ankara's European Union accession bid, said Turkey reserved the right to use military force to stop the PKK. "When it is necessary, we will use all the instruments possible to accomplish our combat against the PKK and we expect the international community to support us," he told reporters. "These instruments include diplomatic dialogue, political instruments, diplomatic instruments and military instruments." A Turkish official said no meeting was planned between Babacan and Zebari in Brussels. SHARING INTELLIGENCE "We have worked very closely with the Turkish government to secure the border and taken a number of concrete measures to prevent PKK terrorism from threatening Turkey," Zebari said. On Friday, Iraqi President Jalal al-Talabani, a Kurd, said a limited Turkish military operation was "now almost inevitable". Baghdad and Washington have both urged Ankara to refrain from a major military incursion, but US President George W. Bush has promised Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan more help, including intelligence sharing, in combating the PKK. US Commander in Iraq General David Petraeus and General James Cartwright, vice-chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, held talks at Turkey's military General Staff in Ankara on Tuesday on tackling the PKK militants. "At the meeting, cooperation and comprehensive sharing of intelligence in the continuing struggle with our common enemy the PKK were discussed," the General Staff said in a statement. Turkey has massed up to 100,000 troops backed by tanks, artillery and planes on Iraq's border and threatened to launch a major military operation to crush the PKK guerrillas. Analysts say Erdogan's ruling centre-right AK Party is reluctant to authorise a major incursion, especially as winter looms, but is under heavy public pressure to take firm action after a series of deadly PKK attacks on Turkish security forces. EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, the official managing Brussels' negotiations with Ankara on its EU accession bid, urged Iraq and Turkey to find a solution via cooperati
