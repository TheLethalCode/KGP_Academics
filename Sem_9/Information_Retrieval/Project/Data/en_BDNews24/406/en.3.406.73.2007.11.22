 LONDON, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The dollar hit record lows against the euro and a basket of major currencies on Thursday while Asian and European stocks slipped as worries intensified over how hard the credit crunch will hit the US economy. Two-year US Treasury note yields ticked lower on the day but were back above 3 percent after breaking below that level for the first time since 2004 during a rally on Wednesday. Oil steadied after knocking the door of $100 this week. The Fed's downgrade of the US growth outlook highlighted the vulnerability of the world's biggest economy as defaults in subprime mortgages hit financial firms and concerns about further possible write-downs spook investors who also fret about rising inflation from surging oil, commodity and food prices. "We are looking for continued dollar weakness and would not be surprised to see the euro break $1.50 within weeks rather than months," said Teis Knuthsen, head of FX research at Danske Markets in Copenhagen. "Primarily it's still the relative economic development between the United States versus the rest of the world, combined with the ongoing financial crisis which is heavily concentrated in the U.S." The euro rose above $1.4870, bringing its gains against the dollar since January to more than 12 percent. It also set fresh all-time highs against the European Central Bank's trade-weighted basket of 24 currencies. The dollar index, which measures the dollar's value against a basket of major currencies, hit a record low of 74.916. Interest rate futures markets are fully pricing in the chance of a 25 basis point U.S. rate cut in December to follow easing in September and October. The FTSEurofirst 300 index erased early losses to stand down 0.2 percent on the day, closing in on Wednesday's three-month low. The move was exaggerated by thin volumes due to the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States. MSCI main world equity index was down 0.15 percent, also dragged lower by weaker Asian and emerging markets. "Pressure on equity markets is now broadening beyond financial stocks to encompass pro-cyclical sectors that previously benefited from expectations of monetary policy easing," Bank of Scotland said in a note to clients. "In other words the monetary morphine is wearing off at a time when the underlying economic injury is worsening. Financial market conditions are accentuating downside risks to economic growth which in turn lead to worsening financial market conditions and it is not obvious that central banks are in a position to break the vicious circle." MONEY STRESS AND SPREADS In the money market, year-end funding concerns are aggravating the stress from the credit crunch. Two-month euro deposit rates, indicated on Reuters system, hit fresh 6-1/2 year highs. Rising interbank money rates and growing risk aversion widened most US interest rate swaps with two-year spreads increasing to record widths on Wednesday. The iTraxx Crossover index, the most widely watched indicator for European credit market sentiment, steadied at 395 bps after blowing out above 400 in the previous session. The December Bund future was up 5 ticks. US light crude steadied at $97.25 a barrel after racing past $99 on Wednesday. Gold held above $800 an ounce, supported by the weak doll
