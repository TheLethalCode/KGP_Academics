 Alip Ghatak bdnews24.com Correspondent BAGERHAT, Nov 21 (bdnews24.com)Seventy-year-old Parul Begum left the makeshift relief centre empty-handed after a five-hour desperate wait for food at AC Laha Pilot High School Wednesday. A helicopter flew in, carrying aidand landed in front of her but she got nothing as the relief was too inadequate for hundreds of cyclone survivors who queued up for hours. Parul was not alone. Hundreds of others hit by the giant cyclone returned home without getting anything from relief workers in Morelganj. Many others rushed wherever they possibly could in search of food and other relief materials. Some were lucky enough to get rice or biscuits. Some were happy with less. Others were out of luck. Moriam Begum, 44, of Sutalori village in Morelganj, lost everything she hadto the Nov 15 cyclone. Even six days after the storm, she had no rice. She lived on whatever dry food she could get hold of. Scenes of desperate rush for food played out in other areas such as Guabaria, Baruikhali and Kenubhanga. Shamsuddin, 35, from Guabaria on the bank of the Panguchhi river was distraught with grief as the cyclone left two-year-old daughter Selina and his 60-year-old mother Rahima Begum dead. He was left with nothing in his home to cook. Kumud Mistri, 55, of Nisanbaria said he had not even received a handful of rice in relief to feed his four-member family. "The cyclone has left my house totally damaged. How can I start farming?" Belayet Hossain, 42, a rickshaw-van puller from Hogolpasha, was injured by a flying iron sheet in the storm. "I can't work for now. The injuries are deep. My house has been wiped out." No aid activities were seen in Baruikhali, Khaulia, Nisanbaria, Shankibhanga, Chholombaria, Hoglabunia unions Wednesday. The bdnews24.com correspondent went to the office of the upazila nirbahi officer (UNO), Krishnakanta Biswas, in Morelganj to seek comments on the complaints of not getting relief. The correspondent waited there for several hours but it was not possible to speak to him despite his assurance of giving information. The upazila land officer, Mollah Mizanur Rahman, claimed that there were no irregularities in relief distribution. Steps have been taken to donate Tk 10,000 to each affected family in the area, he said. Morelganj Municipality chairman Monirul Haque Talukder said the residents along the rivers Boleshwar and Panguchhi were hardest-hit. The government allocation for the area was seven tonnes of riceof which Monirul Haque said he had received only three tonnes. "I got only Tk 1.5 lakh in cash, which is far from enough for a huge number of victims," he said. bdnews24
