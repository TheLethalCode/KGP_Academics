 LONDON, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's FTSE 100 index rose 1 percent early on Friday as merger and acquisition talk lifted miners while beaten-down banks regained some ground, but oil shares were weaker. At 0846 GMT, the FTSE 100 was up 58.7 points at 6,214, after advancing 1.4 percent in the previous session. Trading on the UK benchmark index has been volatile as investors struggle to work out the extent of the credit-related losses and their impact on the broader economy. The FTSE 100 has lost 7.5 percent so far this month and is down 0.1 percent for the year. Miners rose on metal prices and after traders cited market talk of Chinese bid interest in Vedanta Resources. Vedanta, which traded 5.8 percent higher after shooting up nearly 12 percent, declined to comment. Elsewhere in the sector, Anglo American, Lonmin, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto climbed between 2.9 and 4.5 percent. "Yesterday's news in the utility sector has certainly brought some relief to investors after a week or so of volatility. That certainly spurred the market up yesterday.

Knight Vinke accused the bank in newspaper advertisements of giving "an impression that the performance targets were significantly more demanding than they are in reality". Elsewhere in the sector, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds TSB, HBOS and Alliance & Leicester gained between 0.6 and 3 percent. Northern Rock, Britain's most prominent casualty of the global credit market ructions, remained under pressure, down 7.6 percent as uncertainty clouded attempts to take over the bank. Index heavyweight oil shares were also down, with BP down 0.3 percent and Royal Dutch Shell easing 0.9 percent. GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca, considered defensive plays, climbed 2.3 and 3.3 percent, respectively, adding to sharp gains in the previous session after Citigroup raised its rating on the European healthcare sector. On Friday, researchers said GlaxoSmithKline's Rotarix vaccine given along with other routine infant shots was highly effective at protecting against rotavirus, the most common cause of severe diarrhoea in young children.
