 LONDON, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fast bowler Steve Harmison is to join the England side in Sri Lanka on Tuesday ahead of next month's three-test series, the BBC reported on Monday. Harmison, 29, took 13 wickets in two matches for the South African team Highveld Lions after he was asked to prove his form and fitness following a hernia operation. He missed the four-test series against India at home this year and was put on standby for the Sri Lanka tour. England start their tour with a three-day match against a President's XI in Colombo on Tuesday
