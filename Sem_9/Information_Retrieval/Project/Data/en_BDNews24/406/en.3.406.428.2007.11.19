 RIYADH, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Saudi Arabia could keep the United States guessing until the last minute on whether it will attend a Middle East peace conference next week, but analysts and diplomats say a high-level delegation is unlikely. Saudi Arabia -- a key US ally whose presence would give a major boost to the U.S.-sponsored Nov. 26-27 summit in Annapolis, Maryland -- has said it will only attend if core issues are tackled at the latest in a line of Arab-Israeli meetings dating back to Madrid in 1992. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal declined to speak on the issue, telling reporters on Sunday: "The Arab countries will meet on Nov. 22 and the Arab position will be fixed then." He was referring to an Arab foreign ministers meeting at the Arab League in Cairo. In an effort to persuade Arab countries to attend, Israel said this week it will release Palestinian prisoners and pledge not to build new Jewish settlements. Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam whose oil wealth has made it a major diplomatic player, had specified a freeze on settlements as one core issue that could entice it to attend. Arabs want the conference to deal with key issues that would lead to the establishment of a Palestinian state in territories seized by Israel in 1967, including East Jerusalem. Diplomats say Saudi Arabia could maintain a low-level diplomatic presence at the meetings instead of sending its veteran foreign minister. "Right now the position is Saudi Arabia is not attending, that's what it seems -- unless the Americans surprise us with a better agenda," said Jamal Khashoggi, the editor of al-Watan daily, which is owned by a brother of the foreign minister. "You cannot get an answer from any Saudi right now about whether we're going or not," Khashoggi said. Saudi Arabia has no diplomatic relations with Israel and even turning up at Annapolis could be seen as a concession in return for nothing. A Western diplomat in Riyadh said Saudi Arabia prefers for the conference not to take place at all than see possible failure play into the hands of Iran, whose growing regional influence has alarmed U.S. and Saudi leaders. "People here would rather not see the conference take place than for it to happen and come to nothing. That would reinforce Iran and weaken Abbas," he said, referring to U.S.-allied Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. In Riyadh for a summit of OPEC heads of state this week, Iran's firebrand President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad attacked Arabs and others who plan to go to Annapolis. "Those who plan to go there -- who will they represent? The people of Palestine have not given them permission to represent them," he told a news conferen
