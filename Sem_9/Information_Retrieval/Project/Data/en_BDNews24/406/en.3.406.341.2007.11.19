 BAGERHAT, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com) - The Navy Sunday rescued 109 people alive from Dublar Char, a fishing community hit hard by cyclone Sidr, an official said. Another 20 or 30 people managed to get back to Bagerhat on their own. Additional deputy commissioner Mafikul Haque told bdnews24.com Monday night that about 150 people from Dublar Char had made it to Bagerhat. He said 150 had been reported dead and more than 300 others were missing. Cyclone survivors from Dublar Char said that many had died there. They said they had seen dead bodies floating in the canals and in bodies of water in the forest. Ratan Sheikh, a survivor, said: "There was nothing but dead bodies lying here and there. There were corpses in the forest." "Many were washed away by the sea." They said several thousand people were still in Dublar Char with nothing to eat and a severe shortage of drinking water. Most of the evacuees were from Pirojpur. But there were others from districts farther away including Sylhet, Netrakona, Mymensingh, Chittagong, Cox's Bazar, Noakhlai and Barisal. bdnews24.c
