 Dhaka, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com)  District and divisional football association (DFAs) elections have been deferred by 10 days following the devastation caused by cyclone in the southern districts. The decision was taken at an emergency meeting of the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) at its house Thursday. "After receiving requests from different southern districts, we decided to defer the DFA elections by 10 days following the consequences of cyclone Sidr," BFF president SA Sultan told reporters after emerging from the meeting. "The elections of district football associations will now be held by December 15 instead of December 5 and the divisional football association elections by December 24 instead of December 14," Sultan said, "The BFF elections will be held in the first week of February next year instead of January 19." Asked whether the BFF constitution permits the holding of the DFA elections before the new constitution of DFA is approved by the extraordinary meeting (AGM) or annual general meeting (AGM) of the BFF, Sultan said, "There is no need for any EGM or AGM to approve the DFA constitution before the elections." "It remains ineffective three months after the expiration of the elected committee," the BFF boss said, "There is no problem to hold the DFA election from the viewpoint of legal aspect." He, however, said they would seek an explanation from the FIFA about the EGM or AGM before the election. Sultan said the meeting decided to hold a three-match football series between popular Mohammedan Sporting Club and Abahani Limited on December 3, 5, and 7 at Bangabandhu National Stadium in a bid to raise fund for the Sidr survivors. He said ,if the government permits, they would stage a cultural show involving local artistes on December 8 at the same venue for cyclone victims.
