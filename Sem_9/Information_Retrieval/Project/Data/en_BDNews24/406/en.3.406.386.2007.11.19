 Dhaka, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com)  GM Ziaur Rahman and IM Enamul Haq Razib will look at ways of overcoming the chilly weather in icy Siberia when they begin their campaign in the World Chess Championship on Nov 24. Latvian coach Igor Rousis will accompany Zia and Razib, who were scheduled to leave Dhaka Monday night for Khanty-Mansiysk in Russia. "The players will face problem mostly due to chilly weather in Khanty-Mansiysk as it would be difficult for them to cope with the condition," coach Rousis told bdnews24.com. "We have been trained for the games, but we don't know how to be trained for the cold," said a smiling Rousis adding that they had only bought warm clothes from Bangabazar to fight the cold. The Siberian city has current temperature of -10 degrees Celsius, he added. The Latvian believes the cold weather might affect the players' natural performance. Razib (2514 rating) qualified for the World Cup after finishing tenth in the Sixth Asian Individual Championship in the Philippines while Zia (2497 rating) booked his seat as a player nominated by the president of the World Chess Federation. Zia will take on the 19-ranked player, Russain GM Dimitri Jakovenko (2710 rating) while Razib will face Ukrainian GM Pavel Eljanov (2691), the 26-ranked player in the world. The players will face each other twice in the knockout rounds. A total of 128 players will participate in the knockout rounds. bdn
