 DHAKA, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com)  Conflicting reports on the success of aid distribution blurred actual damage estimates, as the Armed Forces Division confirmed a rise in the death count to 3,199 Thursday. bdnews24.com's Sanjay Dey reported that aid delivery was marred by a lack of field-level coordination. Reporters on the scene wired line after line of reports stressing that food, and perhaps more critically, drinking water continued to elude thousands of cyclone survivors.

News organisations qualified reports published earlier quoting aid agencies' claims that the bulk of cyclone victims had been reached. Many victims had yet to be reached, they conceded. With the menace of waterborne diseases looming on the horizon, aid organisations feared that post-storm mortality figures could dwarf the current death toll. The government Thursday okayed US involvement in relief work, Reuters reported, as efforts to get aid to the worst-off continued to flounder. Two C-130 aircraft and two navy vessels carrying 20 or so helicopters would augment the relief effort. Surface water supplies, contaminated by salt water during storm surges that engulfed affected areas, could now be the critical factor. Without access to drinking water, a week after Sidr mauled the southwestern coast, survival for the survivors is becoming an uncertain prospect. A spokeswoman for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said that 'life-saving emergency assistance' would be required for the next two or three months to keep some 2.5 million people alive, according to Reuters. In an eloquent rebuke to premature self-congratulation one 40-year-old woman in Chandpur asked: "What's the use of publishing our story? The chairman, membersno-one is bothered a bit about people like us. Nobody has enquired about us in the past." Her family was facing the prospect of starvation. bd
