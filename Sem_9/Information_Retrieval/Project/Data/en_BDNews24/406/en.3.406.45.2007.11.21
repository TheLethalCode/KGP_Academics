 Dhaka, Nov 21 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka University students Wednesday staged protests, demanding cuts in exams and enrolment fees. The demonstration by about 100 students of the 2006-2007 academic session came amid a ban on street and campus protests in the state of emergency. They also staged a sit-in in front of the Vice Chancellor's Office and some of them met the VC who asked them to submit applications without paying fees. The deadline for applications would be extended if necessary, he added. A meeting of the deans committee slated for Thursday with the chairmen will decide whether fees could be reduced, the VC said. Biplob, a student of the International Relations Department, told bdnews24.com that the students had paid Tk 3,000 in admission fees and Tk 350 in course final exams fees for full year. According to the new rules, the students have to pay Tk 2,500 in fees for final exams and Tk 8,400 in admission fees in two semesters per year. Students have to sign up for a six-month semester twice a year in line with the new rules. bdnews24
