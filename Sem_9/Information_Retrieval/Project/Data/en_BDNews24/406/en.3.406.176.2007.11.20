 Dhaka, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Tuesday sent former Awami League lawmaker Habibur Rahman Mollah to jail after he surrendered to the court in a tax-dodge case. Mollah faces charges for evading payment of Tk 45.41 lakh in taxes on investments of some Tk 1.30 crore made during tax years 1996-97 through 2006-07. The National Board of Revenue (NBR) deputy tax commisioner Md Golam Kabir filed a case on Nov 18. The ex-MP surrendered to the Dhaka Metropolitan Senior Special Judge's Court around noon. Judge Md Azizul Huq refused him bail, appealed for by Mollah's attorney Md Farook Hossain after a 25-minute hearing. Mollah was sent to jail in a prison van at about 12:25pm. Court official Shahadat Hossain told bdnews24.com that the court had granted a verbal request for division, rather than requiring a written request, because Mollah had been a member of parliament. The case by the NBR, filed in the same court, was brought against the former MP for Dhaka-4 after allegations that Food and Allied Industries Ltd, of which he was managing director, had evaded taxes. bdnews2
