 Dhaka, Nov 20(bdnews24.com)  The former Indian central bank chief has said the morality issue in the banking sector lies in transparency over banking practices. Dr Bimal Jalan, former governor of Reserve Bank of India and a member of the Rajya Sabha, said transparency means ensuring international standards in auditing and also bringing to people information on different banking programmes. He made the remarks at the Nurul Matin memorial lecture on "Banking and Morality" Tuesday. AFM Nurul Matin was a renowned banker who in his 25 years of career was deputy governor of Bangladesh Bank, managing director of Bangladesh Shilpa Bank and one of the directors of Bangladesh Institute of Bank Management. The BIBM organised the lecture. Presided over by BIBM director general Mohammad Ruhul Amin, Bangladesh Bank governor and BIBM governing body member Dr Salehuddin Ahmed delivered the welcome speech. "The banking sector in both Bangladesh and India are almost same. The banking sector of the two countries has largely grown on the industrial sector," said Dr Jalan, who was governor of the Reserve Bank of India from 1997 to 2003. "This sector made special contribution to the economies of both the countries. That is why the question of morality in the banking sector is very significant." "The reform in the banking sector is a continuous process. The reform has to be carried out in keeping with the time and the situation. "This calls for making many old laws updated. In this field, the central bank has to play a greater role," said Dr Jalan who was nominated as Rajya Sabha member in August 2003. "The banking activity should be for the common people .Banks are always accountable to people. It has to be ensured that the governing board can act independently," said the former top banker, who is in the city on a three-day visit at the invitation of the Bangladesh Bank. bdnew
