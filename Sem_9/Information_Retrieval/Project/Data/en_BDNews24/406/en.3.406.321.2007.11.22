<TEXT>
 Mongla, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com)  Officials are sweating over the figure of people still missing in the Dublar Char, an isolated small island some 85 km south off Mongla port, with no data on the population. Neither the administration nor the forest office in the Sundarbans has any detail. They blamed it on the cyclone for losing the only register that had the number of passes issued to the fishermen for fishing in the sea every year. "It is varying because there are no valid data. Now we are trying to collect information about the number of inhabitants living here," assistant commissioner Abu Safayat Muhammad Shahedul Islam, also coordinator of relief operations in Dublar Char, told bdnews24.com Thursday. "Until today, we have buried about 200 bodies washed away during the cyclone. The number of death may rise further," he said. Fishermen use Dublar Char as a shelter station in OctoberMarch fishing season. The char, with about 80 square kilometres area, is also a part of the Sundarbans mangrove forest, a world heritage site. Shahedul, referring to a rule of forest department, said fishermen need to collect their passes before they sail for the sea. The passes are used to count the number of people staying here, the official said. But the cyclone Sidr washed away the 'register' the way many fishermen had been washed away by storm surges, he said. "The forest officials say all their registers have been lost during the cyclone," he said. Alaluddin Sheikh, a fisherman who survived the cyclone with his son, said many people died that night. "If you entered the forest, you would have found many bodies. Many people were also washed away," said Alauddin who has been fishing in the area for about 20 years. He said that over 1,000 fishing boats catch fish during the season and that more than 25,000 people lived in the shoal. "All of our records have been washed away. We have no register about how many boats had collected their passes this year," a senior forest department official responsible for Sundarban east zone said seeking anonymity. He also said they had no previous data on how many passes they had issued in past years. "There is no correct figure about the number of fishermen in these areas. But they would be no more than 15000 people," he said. b
