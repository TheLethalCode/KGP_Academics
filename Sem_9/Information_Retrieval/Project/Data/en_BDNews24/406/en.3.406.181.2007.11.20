 PARIS, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French teachers, postal workers and other civil servants joined forces with protesting transport workers on Tuesday in strikes that challenge President Nicolas Sarkozy's plans to reform the economy. Around 30 percent of France's civil servants joined transport and energy workers in a wave of protests over issues ranging from pension reform to the cost of living. The protests, which disrupted schools, trains, postal services and airports, are regarded as the biggest threat to Sarkozy's planned reforms since he was elected president in May. Public Accounts Minister Eric Woerth said strikes were costing France between 300 million euros ($439 million) and 400 million euros a day, and the week-old transport strike could hurt the economy if it dragged on. "Not over several days. But if it lasted longer, it could obviously have consequences," he told France Inter radio. "When you decide not to work, when you prevent goods from circulating in a certain way, when you prevent people from getting to places, obviously that can be a problem at some point." The rail workers oppose Sarkozy's plan to scrap some public sector pension rights. They voted to continue the strike so that it overlapped with Tuesday's one-day walk-out by civil servants. Public sector workers object to Sarkozy's plan not to replace some retiring civil servants, a move he hopes will cut costs, and say their purchasing power is being eroded. UNPOPULAR Carrying banners reading "All together for pensions, wages, jobs, public service", several thousand railway workers, civil servants and supporters from the private sector rallied in Marseille in the south. Some 4,000 people protested in Strasbourg and a large rally is due to be held in Paris later on Tuesday. Opinion polls show the rail strike is unpopular with most French voters. But the government is also under pressure to show it is working for a breakthrough. "A small group of people are holding the country hostage. It's lamentable," said 56-year-old commuter Guy Cousserant. Sarkozy, who has built a reputation as a hands-on president involved in all policy areas, has stayed unusually quiet over the strike and polls show his popularity has suffered. Students blocked access to buildings at dozens of campuses across France in protest at reforms granting more autonomy to universities. Some 58 percent of high school teachers participated in a strike over job cuts, a union official said. Newspaper distributors also began a one-day strike over planned restructuring. Striking energy workers cut 5,500 megawatts (MW) or about 8.7 percent of production capacity at EDF nuclear plants at 0900 GMT, the leading energy union said. State rail operator SNCF has said fewer people than last week were involved in the strike, but services were disrupted. SNCF said about half its high-speed TGV trains would run and the Eurostar link with London would run normally. Trains to Paris's airports were expected to be severely disrupted, as were metro lines. Talks with rail unions are to open on Wednesday. The government says it will not budge on the main points of its plan to overhaul the system of "special regimes", under which some people including rail workers can retire after contributing for 2-1/2 years less than the no
