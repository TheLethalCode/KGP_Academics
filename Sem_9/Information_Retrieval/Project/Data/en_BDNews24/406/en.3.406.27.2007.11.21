 DHAKA, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com)  Disaster management adviser Tapan Chowdhury and lieutenant general Masud Uddin Chowdhury Tuesday ruled out the need for any meeting with politicians to face the aftermath of cyclone Sidr. "Businessmen are able to reach commodities direct to cyclone victims. That's why we held a meeting with them. But there is no need to sit with the politicians," Tapan told reporters after a meeting with business leaders at the food and disaster management ministry. Masud Uddin, the principal staff officer of the Armed Forces Division, who also attended the meeting, said: "I don't think it's necessary to sit with politicians for relief operations." But both said there was no bar on politicians to join forces with relief operations for the Sidr survivors. Tapan called upon all, including the politicians, to come forward to work together to help the victims. "It is the responsibility of politicians to stand by people in times of a crisis," he said. The meeting was designed to chart out ways to cope with the aftermath of the Nov 15 cyclone that affected about 40,000 people in different districts. bd
