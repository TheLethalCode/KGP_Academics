 Dhaka, Nov 21 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong Wednesday tasted their first victory and Khulna consolidated their lead but holders Dhaka lost to Rajshahi in the fifth-round four-dayers of the National Cricket League. Hosts romped to an emphatic six-wicket win over struggling Sylhet at Bir Shrestha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium. Khulna handed down an innings and three-run defeat to Barisal on the final day at Shaheed Chandhu Stadium. A superb five-for from spinner Saqlain Sajib helped Rajshahi give a 70-run thrashing to Dhaka at Rajshahi Divisional Stadium. After the fifth-round, Khulna have 62 points, seven ahead of second-placed Rajshahi, who secured 15 points from the match to raise their tally to 55. Reigning champions Dhaka have 47 points followed by Barisal on 46, Chittagong on 37 and Sylhet on 25. Khulna vs Barisal Barisal resumed the final day on 133 for six looking to avert an innings defeat but managed only 54 runs before being skittled out for 187. Khulna pace duo of Mashrafee Bin Mortaza and Syed Rasel wiped out the tail. Overnight batsman Raisul Islam provided some resistance with 35, but it was not enough to stop Barisal from slumping to first innings defeat in the league. Rasel, who took two wickets Tuesday, returned four for 33 while Mashrafee raised his overnight figures of one for 39 to three for 64 to give Khulna their second consecutive win. Tushar Imran was named man of the match for his brilliant 165 knock that helped unbeaten Khulna post a huge 396 for nine in the first innings. Chittagong vs Sylhet Chittagong knocked off 159 on the final day with Ehsanul Haq and Faisal Hossain Dickens seeing them through to 161 for four in 41.5 overs. Openers Nafis Iqbal (34) and Gazi Salahuddin (25), adjudged man of the match for his excellent 138-run knock in the first innings, gave Chittagong a great start. They suffered a few hiccups to slip to 82 for four but Ehsanul (43) and Faisal (34) put on 79 runs for the unbroken fifth wicket to steer Chittagong home. Rajshahi vs Dhaka Set to chase 323 for a win on the final day, Dhaka managed only 252 in the second innings to concede their first defeat in five four-dayers. Spinner Sajib, who took four wickets in the first innings, once again broke the Dhaka middle and late orders with five for 92 after Farhad Reza (3/45) and Alamgir Kabir (2/46) ran through the top order. Mohammad Ashraful topscored with 58 while Al Shahriar Rokon (44), Mohammad Sharif (42 not out), Mahmudullah Riad (40) and Javed Omar (20) had great starts but failed to stay in the middle for long to keep Rajshahi at bay. Rajshahi ended their second innings on 229 all out with Farhad Reza unlucky not to have got what would have been a deserved century as he fell on his overnight score of 98. Pacer Mahbubul Alam Robin denied Farhad to return with five for 47. b
