 ISLAMABAD, Wed Nov 21, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf returned from Saudi Arabia on Wednesday expecting to be sworn in as a civilian leader in days, having already freed thousands of detainees held under emergency rule. While critical of his imposition of the emergency on November 3, Washington has given General Musharraf, a crucial ally against al Qaeda, space to put things right before a parliamentary election on January 8 that the opposition could boycott. "He has said he's going to take off his uniform, he's said there would be elections. Today he released prisoners, and so far I have found him to be a man of his word," President George W. Bush told ABC News in an interview overnight. On Tuesday, Pakistan announced it had released most of more than 5,000 detained lawyers, opposition and rights activists, and a remaining 2,000 would be freed soon. Although Pakistan is racked with militancy, one of Musharraf's main aims in declaring the emergency was to purge the Supreme Court of judges who appeared set to annul his re-election by parliament last month. The court, now packed with pro-government judges, is expected to strike down the last of six petitions on Thursday. "We hope the petition will be decided tomorrow, God willing, and if it's done then the president may take an oath as a civilian president, as he has himself said, on Saturday or Sunday," Attorney General Malik Qayyum told Reuters. Sacked judges were still under house arrest. Police stopped Wajihuddin Ahmed, who ran against Musharraf in the election, from visiting former chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry and other judges on Wednesday. "We want restoration of superior judges and removal of all existing judges. They are not judges, they are dummies," Ahmed said, as police blocked him and a dozen lawyers. FISHING FOR FRIENDS Musharraf's visit to Saudi Arabia had sparked speculation he would either reach out to former prime minister Nawaz Sharif or seek to prolong his exile there. Musharraf is concerned that he won't have enough friends in the next parliament. He has sought support from another former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, but his strategy up to now has been to marginalize Sharif, the man he deposed in a 1999 coup. Chances of a deal with Bhutto, the leader of the largest opposition party, have receded, but could be revived. Musharraf allowed Bhutto to return to Pakistan in October shielded from prosecution in old graft cases she says were politically motivated. Once back, though, she became increasingly confrontational, and spent a few days under house arrest. Britain's High Commissioner Robert Brinkley met with Bhutto in Karachi on Wednesday, according to her aides. The extent of Musharraf's political isolation since November 3 has become so evident that many political analysts had believed his aim in going to Saudi Arabia was to engage Sharif, who has rebuffed him several times. Western governments fear that stifling democracy could play into the hands of Islamist militants threatening nuclear-armed Pakistan, but Bush was keeping faith with Musharraf. "He has done more for democracy in Pakistan than any modern leader has. Are we happy with the emergency rule? No we're not," Bush said, adding how much he valued Musharraf as an ally. "And do I believe that he's going to end up getting Pakistan back on the road to democracy? I certainly hope so." The Commonwealth of 53 nations, mostly former British colonies, has threatened Pakistan with suspension unless Musharraf repeals emergency rule and takes other steps. Musharraf spent less than 24 hours in Saudi Arabia, meeting King Abdullah and other officials before making a quick pilgrimage to Mecca and returning home on Wednesday morning. His spokesman Rashid Qureshi said there was no contact with Sharif. Go-betweens could have been us
