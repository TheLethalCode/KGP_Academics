<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Batsman Misbah-ul Haq struck a valiant 71 not out to dig Pakistan out of serious trouble to 210 for eight on day one of the first test against India on Thursday. Indian leg spinner Anil Kumble grabbed three wickets on his captaincy debut as the home bowlers dominated in the first two sessions to reduce Pakistan to 142 for eight at tea. Misbah, playing only his eighth test, scored his maiden test fifty and had raised 68 runs for the unbroken ninth wicket with tail-ender Mohammad Sami (20 not out). The pair frustrated Indian bowlers in the final session until play was called off 4.2 overs early due to poor light. Misbah struck five fours and a six against off-spinner Harbhajan Singh, who also dropped a stiff chance at midwicket after the batsman, on 69, pulled paceman Munaf Patel. The 33-year-old dug in for four-and-half hours to give skipper Shoaib Malik some relief having elected to bat on a Ferozshah Kotla pitch of low bounce and mild seam movement. "The pitch showed variable bounce but some of the batsmen played shots they would surely reconsider," Pakistan coach Geoff Lawson told reporters. "Misbah was at his fighting best and he and Sami played according to instructions." Pakistan were in trouble after fast bowler Zaheer Khan grabbed the first two wickets in the morning to reduce the visitors to 74 for three at lunch. The 37-year-old Kumble picked one wicket in the opening session and added two more as five wickets tumbled for 66 runs in the post-lunch session. PRIZE SCALP Khan struck in the fifth over when he bowled opener Salman Butt for one run and then drew a reckless hook shot from experienced Younis Khan (7) to have him caught at backward square leg. Kumble then bowled opener Yasir Hameed with a googly for 29. Saurav Ganguly, who bowled a sharp spell of seam, claimed the prize scalp of Mohammad Yousuf in the second over after lunch, trapping him leg before for 27 off the first delivery he faced after the interval. Patel left Pakistan in disarray after he had skipper Malik caught behind for a duck off a short delivery that kicked off short of good length. Ganguly warned against letting Pakistan off the hook. "Everyone bowled well," he said. "There was some moisture on the pitch which may not be there in the next few days. It got better to bat after tea today. "If we let them get to 300 tomorrow we would have put in a really bad effort." Kumble claimed three for 38 and Khan two for 36. Pakistan had included left-arm paceman Sohail Tanvir for his test debut and recalled strike bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Sami for their first tests since January. India's Harbhajan was playing his first test since June 2006. The second and third tests will be played in Kolkata and Bangalore
