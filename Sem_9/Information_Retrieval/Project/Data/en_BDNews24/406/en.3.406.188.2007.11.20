 CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Nov 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A pair of spacewalking astronauts floated outside the International Space Station on Tuesday for the first of a two-part outing to complete installation of the newly arrived Harmony connecting module. Hooking up Harmony will clear the station for the arrival of Europe's long-delayed laboratory module, which is to be taken aloft aboard space shuttle Atlantis on Dec. 6. While station commander Peggy Whitson and flight engineer Dan Tani worked on the orbital outpost, the shuttle Atlantis crew was scheduled to participate in a dress rehearsal for launch at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. "So far we are looking right on schedule for Dec. 6," Atlantis commander Stephen Frick told reporters on Monday during a break in training. He and his six crewmates, including European Space Agency astronauts Hans Schlegel and Leopold Eyharts, will dress in bright orange flight suits later on Tuesday morning and board Atlantis for the final few hours of the practice countdown. Meanwhile, 210 miles (330 km) above the planet, Whitson and Tani began a 6.5-hour task to rig Harmony's electrical and cooling systems. The outing began nearly an hour ahead of schedule at 5:10 a.m. EST (1010 GMT). "There's a big city right underneath us," Whitson said, getting her first peak out of the airlock. "Cool," said Tani, "Where are we?" During Tuesday's spacewalk, the astronauts plan to move an 18-foot-long, 300-pound pallet that holds fluid lines for Harmony, which was delivered by a shuttle crew last month. Backup systems will be installed during a second spacewalk scheduled for Saturday. NASA needs to fly 10 more assembly missions and two resupply flights to complete the station and retire the shuttle fleet by 2010. They agency also plans a final servicing call to the Hubble Space Telescope next
