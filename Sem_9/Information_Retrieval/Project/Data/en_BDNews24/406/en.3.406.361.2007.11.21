<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 21 (bdnews24.com)  Acting BNP secretary general Hafizuddin Ahmed Wednesday said the affluent and the business community needed to come to the aid of cyclone survivors. "This is not the moment to do politics. The businessmen and the rich should join the relief operations," Hafiz told reporters at his Banani home Wednesday prior to heading for Bhola with relief materials. "This year's cyclone has left a trail of devastation. All of us should stand by those affected to help them cope with the disaster." Hafiz said they had formed a 13-member team, headed by standing committee member Mahbubur Rahman. A total of Tk 5 lakh relief materials would be disbursed among the affected people by the relief team, the acting secretary general said. "We have to join relief operations in collaboration with the government for the cyclone victims," Hafiz said. "The cyclone has damaged the Aman crop. The farmers have nothing. The government will have to implement a massive programme to make up for the loss." "BNP is a major political party. We are also distributing relief at local levels alongside the central team," Hafiz said. bdnews24
