 LONDON, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British mortgage lender Northern Rock is likely to have borrowed a further 1.1 billion pounds ($2.3 billion) from the Bank of England (BoE) in the past week, according to BoE balance sheet data released on Thursday. That would be down from its estimated loan of 2 billion pounds in the week before last. The latest data indicate Northern Rock has borrowed up to 26.4 billion pounds since being offered emergency funds on Sept. 14. The estimate is based on the "other assets" category in the Bank of England's weekly accounts, which economists say would include the central bank's "lender of last resort" support.

But Northern Rock shares have fallen for the last seven days and by 1530 GMT were down a further 1 percent at 84 pence, on an expectation bidders will offer little to shareholders. The bank's market value is now 340 million pounds, down 93 percent this year. Adam Applegarth, who resigned as chief executive last week but may stay until February to help the sale process, will receive up to 380,000 pounds when he leaves, a person familiar with the matter said. Applegarth will not receive severance pay, bonus or pension top-up, but is entitled to up to half his basic annual salary of 760,000 pounds, the person said. The CEO was paid 1.36 million pounds last year, including 660,000 pounds in bon
