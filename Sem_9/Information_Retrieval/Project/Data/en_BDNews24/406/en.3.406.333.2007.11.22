 DHAKA, Nov 22 (bdnews24.com) -- A group of angry investors gathered outside the Dhaka Stock Exchange Thursday protesting the Securities and Exchange Commission's latest suspension of loan payouts from merchant banks and brokerage houses. Some 300mostly small-investorsraised their concerns in a demonstration lasting from 11 in the morning to 2 in the afternoon in front of the bourse. Police stationed in the area had to bar entry to some members of the group fearing they were going to ransack the DSE office. Police later cordoned the area off to bring the situation under control. The SEC took the decision to suspend loan payouts Monday in an attempt to cool the over-heating market. Stock prices on the DSE entered their third day of decline Thursday. The DSI or all-shares price index lost 22.739 points to close and 2504.189. The DGEN or general index shed 26.733 points to close at 2958.199. DSE-20 blue chip fell 23.247 points to close at 2356.441 "We demand an immediate withdrawal of the SEC's decision, for the revival of the stock market," said Nasir Ahmed, one of the protestors. "Although the SEC took the decision to help retail investors, we have not benefited. The move will only benefit middle and higher end investors," he added. Angry investors also tried to hand in a letter addressed to the chief executive officer of the DSE, although he was in Chittagong attending the opening ceremony of the new DSE office there. The Merchant Bankers' Association of Bangladesh was also scheduled to submit a memorandum to the chairman of the SEC urging him to withdraw the ban on loan disbursement by merchant banks and brokerage houses. Loan facilities extended by merchant banks and some brokerage houses to retail investors have played an important role in setting the recent bullish trend in the market. The SEC suspended payouts as they felt the market was becoming too 'risky' for investors, especially those involved in retail trading. The regulatory body said the large gap between demand and supply of quality shares was a major reason for the move. bdnew
