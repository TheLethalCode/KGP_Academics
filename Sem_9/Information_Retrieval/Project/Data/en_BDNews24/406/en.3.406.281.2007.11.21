 NEW DELHI, Nov 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India hopes to wrap up a free trade agreement with ASEAN by March next year, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said on Wednesday in Singapore, and he vowed to show flexibility in negotiations. The Association of South East Asian Nations, which signed a landmark charter on Tuesday aiming for economic integration, is meeting leaders from Japan, China, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand in the annual "ASEAN+6" meeting. "I have no doubt that we all share a common political will to reach an agreement at the earliest," Singh said in his speech in the city state, a copy of which was released in New Delhi. "I want to assure you that on its part India has shown and will continue to show, the necessary flexibility and determination to achieve this objective. "We will work together with you to conclude the negotiations, as agreed, by March next year." The free trade agreement with India had stalled over agricultural tariffs. India is also negotiating a similar deal with the European Union and hopes to finalise it by end-2008. Singh said India and the ASEAN bloc should set a bilateral trade target of $50 billion by 2010, and also proposed setting up an India-ASEAN green fund with an initial investment of $5 million for pilot projects to promote clean technologies. New Delhi has also suggested an India-ASEAN network on climate change to pool and share expertise and exchange best practices to tackling global warming. "Once the fund is established I invite other countries to make contributions as well," Singh said. He said the Indian economy was now on a new growth trajectory and it was possible to sustain 9.0-10.0 percent economic growth annually for several years. The Indian economy, Asia's third largest, has grown at an average 8.6 percent for the past four years and is poised to grow at similar levels in the year to March 20
