 LONDON, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares rose on Friday, helped by a fresh wave of merger chatter in the financials and mining sectors, while a fall in oil prices hit energy shares. By 0850 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.9 percent at 1,466.72 points, having rallied 0.7 percent on Thursday driven by a surge in pharmaceutical stocks. Volumes were light as Tokyo and US markets were closed.. Advancers outnumbered decliners by 4 to 1. "Obviously with the euro at $1.49 plus ... people may come back to which sectors are exposed and that is bad news for autos, aerospace and defence," said Edmund Shing, a strategist at BNP Paribas in Paris. "If you look at the sector level, the pharma sector had a massive advance (on Thursday) ... now, number one, this is a big sector that was a key driver of the market yesterday, can that be sustained or is it a dead-cat bounce?" he said. Financials were the top-performing sector, but pharmas were once again among the biggest positive weights on the index. Novartis rose 1.4 percent, while GlaxoSmithKline rose 0.7 percent and Roche rose 0.6 percent. CNP Assurances was the top percentage gainer, rising by about 7 percent, while AXA shares were down 0.1 percent. French newspaper Les Echos reported insurer AXA was eyeing local rival CNP Assurances. Axa was not available to comment and CNP declined immediate comment. Banking stocks rose, led by UBS and Royal Bank of Scotland, which both rose nearly 3 percent, while Barclays gained 1.8 percent and Societe Generale added 2.5 percent. Concern over losses at the banks linked to the subprime lending crisis has helped pushed the FTSEurofirst down by 1 percent for the year, which could result in the first yearly decline in five years. The index is still down 8 percent this month, but after two days of gains, is 2 percent above this week's three-month lows. M&A HELPS MINERS TOO Merger talk also helped boost the mining sector, where Vedanta Resources rose by 6.6 percent, traders said. Fellow miner Xstrata rose 3.6 percent and Antofagasta rose 3 percent, while takeover target Rio Tinto was the top weighted gainer on the broader European market, rising 4 percent. In other European markets, London's FTSE 100 index was up 0.9 percent, while Frankfurt's DAX was up 0.3 percent and the Paris CAC 40 rose 0.5 percent. With the euro hovering around fresh record highs against the dollar, auto stocks were the biggest negative weight. BMW fell 0.5 percent, while Fiat was down 0.8 percent and Porsche fell 1.7 percent. The euro has risen by 13 percent this year against the dollar, which has hit companies such as Airbus parent EADS hard. Airbus CEO Tom Enders said on Thursday described the dollar's fall as "life-threatening" to the aircraft manufacturer. Against the Japanese yen however the euro has only risen by about 2 percent this year. "Over the previous months, complaints from European companies on the weak dollar in general were fairly modest," KBC analysts wrote in a report. "However, the declarations from the Airbus management yesterday that the current level of the dollar has gone beyond the pain barrier and that its rapid decline might be life-threatening for the company, suggest that we gradually enter another era," KBC said. Energy shares were also stuck in negative territory in line with a modest fall in the price of crude oil, which fell 0.1 percent to $97.18 a barr
