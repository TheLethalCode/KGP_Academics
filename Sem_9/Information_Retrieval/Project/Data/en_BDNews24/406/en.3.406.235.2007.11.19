 Patuakhali, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com)  Standing on the bank of the Andharmanik river, one gets a sense of the fury of the storm that lashed the coast of Bangladesh. Kalapara in Patuakhali bears bleak testimony to the cataclysmic force unbound by Sidr's 225 kilometres per hour winds. What remains of Kalapara, flanked by the Bay of Bengal, is a surreal landscape haunted by grief. The only ferry in town was lying upended on the bank. The Dhaka-Khepupara two-storey launch 'Pubali' was wedged onto a rice mill near the river. A large barge had been flung out of the river, and lay a considerable distance inland. The neighbourhood that had grown up along the town protection embankment was no ghost townit was little more than a string of debris. Most residents of a rehabilitation housing project along the bank of the river in Salimpur village, Nilganj union, had fled to storm shelters on Nov 15. But Harida and Mahinur did not leave their homes until 10pm. They escaped to the embankment after the rising waters of the Andharmanik river started to seep into their houses. Hajera Khatun, 65, died at home on the fateful Thursday night. She stayed home with daughter-in-law Paribanu. Paribanu said: "We did not go to the embankment because there was no man in the house. Water started to flood the house at 10.30pm. I shut the door thinking that the water would soon recede." "Moments later, I found myself submerged in waist-high water and started shouting for help. All of a sudden, I was snatched away by a wave." "There was chest-high water all around." "I called a neighbour and rushed to my mother-in-law." The lamp in the room had gone out. She had drowned and the cot had been washed away. bdnews
