 Islamabad, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan will hold a general election on Jan. 8, the election commission announced on Tuesday, helping to clear some uncertainty more than two weeks after President Pervez Musharraf imposed emergency rule. "Polling for the national and provincial assemblies will be held the same day and will be transparent from all aspects," chief election commissioner Chaudhry Mohammad Farooq said in a televised address on state-run television. Musharraf, who is also army chief, imposed emergency rule on Nov. 3, saying it would reinforce the fight against al Qaeda and Taliban militants and ensure free and fair elections. Opposition parties have called for emergency rule to be lifted and have warned they might boycott the vote.
