<TITLE> Lebanese watch crisis, frustrated and worried </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIRUT, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Lebanese watched their politicians on Friday with a mixture of frustration at the deadlock over a new president and worry that ordinary people would pay the price if the conflict turns violent. As the clock ticked away the minutes to the time when President Emile Lahoud's mandate expires at midnight, many of them said they wanted a quick solution, but realistically they expected a constitutional vacuum, at least in the short term. The politicians failed on Friday to find a presidential candidate acceptable to both the parliamentary majority and the opposition block led by the Shi'ite Muslim group Hezbollah. Parliament will try again to elect a president next Friday. The divide reflects the struggle for dominance in Lebanon between Syria and Iran on one side, and the United States, with Saudi and European sympathy, on the other. "We are worried the crisis will lead to a vacuum and possibly the partition of the country. Unfortunately the solution is in the hands of those abroad, especially the Americans," said Ali Daaibis, a clerk in a hardware shop. "This crisis is bad news," added Ali Mobiya, a carpet dealer in his 30s. "The members of parliament should get together and elect a president," he added. The decision to postpone the vote leaves Lebanon without an agreed head of state from midnight. To prevent trouble, the army has deployed in force around parliament, sealing off most of the roads to the building and searching pedestrians. "ALL CROOKS" Out of about 20 civilians questioned by Reuters, many said they were fed up with politics and politicians and wanted only to live their lives in peace, security and prosperity. "We don't want a civil war. We want the economy to thrive. The politicians are all thieves and they should go," said Said al-Homsi, who works in a central Beirut flower shop. "They are all crooks, looking out for their own interests and paying no attention to the people," said Daaibis. "I want them to get this over with," said a woman who gave her family name as Hazimeh. "The country needs to breathe and relax, like any other country. We don't feel safe. Everyone is tense and apprehensive and we are paralysed," she added. She apologised for the channel to which the television behind her was tuned -- a political channel interviewing a politician. "My colleague left it on. I never watch the news. I watch songs and videoclips and soap operas," she said. "The people don't want war. Look, we are Christian and Shi'ites all sitting happily together here," said Rose Kodjikian, an elderly Armenian Christian. Lebanese aged over 25 have memories of the civil war which devastated the country between 1975 and 1990. The younger ones saw the damage inflicted in last year's war between Israel and Hezbollah, in south Lebanon and Beirut's southern suburbs. Over the last three years the country has witnessed some 30 politically motivated attacks, which have killed dozens of people, including eight anti-Syrian politicians and journalists. "What we are seeing is a conflict between two projects for Lebanon -- the American project and the nationalist project. Unfortunately if it leads to violence, it's the people who will pay the price," said a hairdresser who gave his name as Hamada.
