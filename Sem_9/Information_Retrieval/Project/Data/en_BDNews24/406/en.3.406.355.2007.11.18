 Olip Ghatak bdnews24.com Correspondent Bagerhat, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com)  Accurate news from the largely impenetrable Sundarbans area has been in short supply following the devastating destruction wrought by tropical cyclone Sidr. Calls placed to the headquarters of the Sundarbans East Zone have largely gone unanswered. bdnews24.com's Bagerhat correspondent asked two officers from the navy and coastguard about the extent of destruction to the World Heritage Site. "It is not possible to say in words how much damage was done. The familiar green Sundarbans is now unrecognisable," said an officer, who was assigned to post-cyclone rescue operations in the Kotka, Kochikali and Dubla areas, along with a colleague. "Our wireless is now out of order, and the mobile network cut off. We can't dispatch our reports, as we have no contact with our colleagues," the officer said. Rafikul Hossain, a forest ranger speaking from the Bagerhat control room, said: "I can only confirm the death of one of my colleagues, Saidur Rahman. We found his dead body earlier." According to the forest department, Saidur Rahman was on duty at Narkelbaria in Dubla when he was caught up in the huge tidal surge created by the mega-cyclone. Saidur, from Rayenda in Bagerhat, lost his life with four fishermen. Forest department officials recovered their bodies Saturday. On the night of the cyclone there were over 450 forest department staff and an unknown number of fishermen on the Bagerhat coast, forestry officials said. SM Shahidullah, a forest officer for the Sundarbans East Zone, said he had been trying to trace his colleagues, based various stations and camps, for the last two days. Another forest officer, who preferred not to be named, said: "After the wooden wall of the camp blew away we climbed a tree and braced ourselves. At least eight feet of water swell engulfed us." "I saw many dead bodies floating on the water," he added. The Sundarbans East Zone covers about 2.33 lakh hectares, with around 450 forest officials employed in 39 camps within two ranges named Swarankhola and Chandpai. Hundreds of other workers also live in the area as cooks and boatmen. However, by far the greatest amount of people descends on the area to fish with at least 16,000 fishermen coming to Dubla village, with work permits, during the dry fish season. They largely come from southern areas such as Bagerhat, Khulna, Barisal and Chittagong, forest officials said. Five cyclone shelters have been built around the Dubla fishing village, although they reportedly only accommodated around 5,000 people on the night of the cyclone. Many took refuge in the mangrove forest's many canals in boats and trawlers. The district administrator's control room could not provide any exact data on the extent of the deaths till Sunday afternoon. The navy and coastguard reported they had recovered 37 bodies from the area over the last two days. Assistant forest officer for Chandpai Range, SM Shoaib Khan, said that 95 percent of the Forest Department infrastructure in the Sundarbans East Zone had been damaged by the cyclone. Saplings worth Tk 5 crore have been damaged, which were prepared for plantation in the Chandpai Range," said Khan. The Forest Department could not put any figure on the possible extent of damage done to wildlife in the area. bdnews24.c
