 Dhaka, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com)  A special judge's court Sunday delayed verdict on a tax-dodge case against former BNP lawmaker Salahuddin Ahmed's son Tanvir Ahmed due to overload of work, a lawyer said. Defence lawyer Abdul Haque told reporters that judge Md Ashraf Hossain of the Special Judge's Court-5 set up on the Jatiya Sangsad premises did not deliver the verdict due to the overload of work. The date for judgement would be fixed later, he said, adding that the court was busy with the cases against former BNP minister Nazmul Huda, Salahuddin and former police official Shahidullah Khan. Assistant tax commissioner Md Moniruzzaman of the National Board of Revenue filed the case with Dhaka metropolitan senior special judge Azizul Haque's court on Oct 1 against Tanvir. He charged him with not submitting income tax returns and concealing information about his wealth. The court issued a warrant of arrest against Tanvir, who has been on the run, shortly after the case was filed. According to case details, Tanvir concealed information of Tk 30.02 lakh property in income tax return for the last two tax years. Besides, he did not submit any return in the tax year 2006-07, the case alleged. Charges were framed in the case on Oct 25 in the Special Judge's Court-5. On Nov 5, Tanvir's mother Mosammat Shamsunnahar and brother Imran Ahmed were sentenced to eight years in jail for evading tax. They are also on the run. bdne
