<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Nov 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - In-form India batsman Yuvraj Singh has been left out of the team for the first test against Pakistan starting on Thursday in favour of the experienced Saurav Ganguly and Vangipurappu Laxman. "It's unfortunate, but at least for this game for sure he will have to wait," new captain Anil Kumble told reporters on Wednesday. "More than deciding on the composition, it is tough for Yuvraj." Yuvraj amassed 272 runs including four fifties in the recent one-day series win over Pakistan. "He is really important for Indian cricket moving forward and I'm sure the entire batting will revolve around him very soon," Kumble said. Leg spinner Kumble was delighted to begin his captaincy at his favourite Ferozshah Kotla ground where he became only the second bowler in test history to take all 10 wickets in an innings, against Pakistan in 1999. "Delhi has been really nice for me personally and also for India," he said. "I hope we have a good start and it continues." India will be without injured fast bowlers Shanthakumaran Sreesanth and Rudra Pratap Singh. Replacement Munaf Patel is set to share the new ball with Zaheer Khan. Kumble also said he would partner off spinner Harbhajan Singh, who will make his test comeback after being missing recent tours of Bangladesh and England due to poor form. The 37-year-old Kumble expects Pakistan to provide a tougher challenge than in the one-day series and said the hosts would be particularly wary of leg spinner Danish Kaneria and prolific batsman Mohammad Yousuf. "We need to look at it as a new series," he said. "We respect Pakistan as an opposition. We won the one-dayers, but it depends on how each team take their own defeat or victory. "We have the potential to go out there and win the series and we will do everything that is in our hands to do that.
