 Patuakhali, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com)  Army chief General Moeen U Ahmed Tuesday urged people ravaged by super cyclone Sidr not to lose heart. He gave out relief goods to the survivors at Char Lata, in Galachipa, Patuakhali and told locals to face the aftermath together. The residents of the shoal demanded that the government erect girder embankments along the coast to protect them against storm surges. "I'll do my best to place your demands with the right quarters," Moeen told them. He also told them that many local and foreign organisations had already come forward in aid of the disaster victims. bdnews
