 Dhaka, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong Monday enforced follow-on on Sylhet who were looking down the barrel on the second day of the fifth round four-dayer of the National Cricket League. Sylhet, bundled out for a paltry 127 in reply to Chittagong's first innings total of 308 all out, still need another 105 runs to avert innings defeat after finishing the day on 76 for four in the second innings at Bir Shrestha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium. Barisal were in trouble on 159 for five against Khulna, who declared their first innings at 396 for nine at Shaheed Chandhu Stadium in Bogra. Barisal, trailing by 237 runs in the first innings, still need another 87 runs to avoid follow-on with five wickets in hands at the close of second day. Away at Rajshahi Divisional Stadium, hosts Rajshahi reduced Dhaka to 205 for nine after scoring 298 all out in the first innings. Chittagong vs Sylhet Pacers Kamrul Islam (3/34) and Tareq Aziz (2/49) sharing five wickets to run through the Sylhet top order while spinner Saju Datta demolished the middle order to wrap the visitors' first innings with four for 23. Only four Sylhet batsmen  Rajin Saleh (21), Mushfiqur Rahim (14), Alok Kapali (12) and Sharifullah (10)  managed made double-digit scores in the face of some tight bowling from the port city outfit.
