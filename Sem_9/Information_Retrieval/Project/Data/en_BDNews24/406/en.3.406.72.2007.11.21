 Dhaka, Nov 21 (bdnews24.com) Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Wednesday acknowledged the crucial role played by the armed forces in national emergencies such as the current cyclone crisis in a message on Armed Forces Day. The nation observes Armed Forces Day in remembrance of Nov 21, 1971, when the Bangladesh Army, Navy and Air Force were officially commissioned to launch the ultimate offensive against the Pakistani occupation forces. President Iajuddin Ahmed and the chief adviser gave separate messages of tribute. "The role of the armed forces in safeguarding our independence and sovereignty as well as in UN peacekeeping missions worldwide has been lauded at home and abroad," the president's message said. Iajuddin said the armed forces are a symbol of the nation's pride and that the nation remembers their contribution, dedication and sacrifice during the War of Liberation with utmost respect. Fakhruddin in his message said the armed forces are the vanguards in the efforts in protecting the nation's independence, sovereignty and integrity. Under the present circumstances, the armed forces play a crucial role in curbing serious crimes and corruption, and maintaining law and order at all levels as well as taking part in all national emergencies such as massive natural disasters. The day's observance began with special prayers at the mosques of army cantonments, naval bases and air force stations. President Iajuddin paid his respects to those who laid down their lives in the War of Independence by laying wreaths at the Eternal Flame in Dhaka Cantonment. Army chief General Moeen U Ahmed, Navy chief Vice Admiral Sarwar Jahan Nizam and Air Force chief Air Marshal SM Ziaur Rahman also laid wreaths at the Eternal Flame. The president also hosted a reception at the secretariat of the Armed Forces Division to honour the families of the freedom fighters awarded the Bir Shreshthho (the highest military award for bravery) and other military award winners. bdnews24
