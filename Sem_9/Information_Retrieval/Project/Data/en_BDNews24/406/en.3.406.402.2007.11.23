 BRUSSELS, Nov 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European Union ministers agreed on Friday to set up a new research body to spur innovation and growth in the 27-nation bloc, but funding remained unresolved even though countries jostled to host it. "We have given our approval to the proposed regulation concerning the European Institute of Innovation and Technology," said Jose Mariano Gago, science and technology minister for EU president Portugal. The institute is the brainchild of European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, who envisaged a 2.3 billion euro ($3.43 billion) campus-based institute to rival the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States. But faced with initial scepticism on the part of Britain and other EU states, the plan put forward by the Commission was watered down by the bloc's members and the European Parliament. Hopes that private companies would step forward with wads of cash also evaporated. Instead, the EIT will have a more modest start with a budget of 308.7 million euros covering the initial six years with three research projects into climate change, renewable energy and next generation information and communication technologies. The Commission's initial vision of a campus institute was also ditched in favour of the EIT being part of a network of universities and private research bodies. HATS IN THE RING The EU executive's plan for the EIT to award degrees was also scrapped and participating universities can instead attach an EIT moniker to their degrees if they want to do so. The new body was also renamed the European Institute of Innovation and Technology but will keep the EIT acronym. The deal reached by ministers is effectively identical to a first reading vote in parliament. "The EIT is expected to kick off its activities from the spring of 2008," EU Research Commissioner Janez Potocnik said. Funding remained a source of concern for some states. EU budget ministers also meet on Friday to try and thrash out a deal for the EIT and the bigger 3.4 billion euro Galileo satellite navigation system. "We fully support the text today and we look forward to early progress on setting up the EIT," British research minister Ian Pearson said. "We note the source of funding is still unresolved and hope this can be sorted out later today, so we cannot support this political agreement and will abstain," Pearson said. Finland, the Netherlands, Italy and others said the EIT's secretariat should be light but with a heavyweight governing board to attract support from research bodies and businesses. Hungary, Poland and Austria want to host the secretariat. "Poland will do its utmost to contribute to the financing of the EIT," a Polish minister told Friday's meeting. "Perhaps the host country should shoulder most of the funding effort," added a Bulgarian minister, raising a smile.
