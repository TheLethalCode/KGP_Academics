<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com)  The submarine cable that links the country to the rest of the world through internet and telephone was repaired Monday morning after being 'cut' for a second time in six days. Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board's cable link was restored following a seven and half an hours disruption from 12:55am Monday, said BTTB officials. "The link was severed at Gachhbaria, about 44 kilometres from Chittagong," BTTB Chittagong divisional engineer Aminur Rahman told bdnews24.com. "Vandals or saboteurs cut through the cable using a hacksaw blade," Rahman said. BTTB officials had earlier in the day said the disruption had taken place along the Cox's Bazar-Chittagong highway, about 95 km from the port city. Monday's disturbance meant BTTB's optical fibre link has suffered 23 major disruptions since its installation on May 21, 2006, say BTTB officials. However, IT, software businessmen and internet service providers say the disruptions have been much higher, 27 to be exact. According to BTTB reports, vandals and 'saboteurs' have been responsible for at least nine of these disruptions. Other causes for past disruptions include landslides in Chittagong, building and maintenance of infrastructure such as roads and highways, and road accidents on the main Cox's Bazar-Chittagong highway alongside which the cable runs for part of its length. The submarine cable was most recently cut on Nov 13. bdnews
