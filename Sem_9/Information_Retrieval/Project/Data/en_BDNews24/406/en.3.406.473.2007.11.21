 Dhaka, Nov 21 (bdnews24.com) -- The World Bank has offered up to $250 million in disaster mitigation funds to assist Bangladesh in its recovery following the devastation wrought by cyclone Sidr, the multilateral lending agency said in a statement Tuesday. "This is a horrible shock to Bangladesh and our sympathies are with the thousands of families who have lost loved ones; with the millions who have lost livelihoods and shelter," said Xian Zhu, World Bank country director for Bangladesh. Zhu said the World Bank was willing to make up to $250 million available to the government, depending on its financing needs and what other donors brought to the table. "Of course Bangladesh is still in the rescue and relief phase, but as it moves into recovery over the next few days, our commitment is a signal to government of the scale of what we can offer if needed," said Zhu. The WB said their assistance could be used to support short-term needs like food imports, the rapid procurement of medical supplies and cash grants to the poorest victims. The funds could also be used to help the affected people recover their sources of income and livelihood, the Bank said. Longer term plans include rehabilitation efforts such as rebuilding embankments and other flood protection infrastructure. The WB country director praised Bangladesh for the progress it made in dealing with the impact of periodic flooding and cyclones. The Bank's assistance will also target vulnerable coastal areas in view of heightened risks in the future from climate change. The funds will complement existing commitments from the World Bank that were put into place following the floods in August and September. bd
