 KHARTOUM, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Armed raiders who killed 10 African Union soldiers in an attack on their base used vehicles marked with the letters JEM - the name of a powerful Darfur rebel group, the UN reported on Monday. JEM, or the Justice and Equality Movement, denied any involvement in the attack on the AU base in the eastern Darfur town of Haskanita when it happened in late September.

"The motive of the attack appears to have been looting of AMIS logistical equipment." The underequipped African force of around 7,000 troops from 26 countries patrolling Darfur, a region the size of France, is due to be replaced next year by a "hybrid" 26,000-strong AU-UN force. The reort said the roll-out of the new hybrid force was now well under way. But it repeated concerns expressed by U.N. peacekeeping chief Jean-Marie Guehenno last week that the peacekeeping force was "at risk" unless disputes with Sudan over its make-up are resolved and key specialized units found. International experts estimate 200,000 people have died in the Darfur conflict and 2.5 million driven from their homes, but Sudan says only 9,000 have di
