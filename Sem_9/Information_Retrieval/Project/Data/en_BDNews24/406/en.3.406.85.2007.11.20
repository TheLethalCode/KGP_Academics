 Dhaka, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com)  India has lifted the ban on exports of rice to Bangladesh, the Indian High Commission said in a statement Monday. The decision will "enable Bangladesh to procure 50,000 tons of rice from India", the statement said. India imposed a ban on non-basmati rice exports on Oct 9, which was officially announced on Oct 15. The statement also said India would provide a "comprehensive" relief package of $1 million (Tk 6.8 crore) for cyclone victims. "This package will consist of relief material...including medicine, food items, tents and blankets, first-aid kits and other relief items," the Indian mission said. Indian external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee had earlier spoken to his Bangladesh counterpart Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury to send relief supplies to the cyclone-affected people.
