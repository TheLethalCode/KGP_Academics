<TITLE> Banks, oils help Europe shares up in choppy trade </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares rose in volatile trade by midday on Tuesday, helped by banks that gained on rate cut hopes and energy shares that benefited from a higher oil price. At 1202 GMT the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.66 percent at 1,472.40 points, having fluctuated in a wide 1.5 percent range, its most volatile day since Aug. 31. Banks were the top positive weight on the index, with Barclays jumping 6.5 percent and Royal Bank of Scotland 4.5 percent as traders cited vague talk of a cut in the Bank of England's emergency rate. As per its normal practice, the Bank of England declined to comment on market rumours. Heavyweight oil and gas shares tracked the oil price, which rose by around $1 to $95.60 a barrel, boosted by talk of a cut in US interest rates to help ease a credit crunch. Royal Dutch Shell and Total both gained more than 1 percent and BP ticked up 0.2 percent. But the FTSEurofirst 300 was still down nearly 1 percent on the year compared to a 15 percent rise at this time in 2006, punctured by worries that a credit crunch stemming from a crisis in risky U.S. mortgages would spread to the wider economy. "There's been unrelenting pressure on financials for the past few weeks. It's a function of the tight availability of liquidity feeding through to stockholder nerves," said Andrew Bell, European strategist at Rensbury Sheppard Investment Management. "Investors have had their toes bitten off at the knee whenever they've tried to dip their feet into the water, and confidence is low that they'll find a base from which to recover," he added. "On a 12-month view one will still make good money on equities from here but not if there is a recession next year." British lender Northern Rock, one of the prominent victims of the credit crunch, plummeted 42 percent on worries that it would have to be sold cheap. The stock regained some ground after a person familiar with the situation said U.S. buyout firm JC Flowers had made an offer involving a fresh investment to support the balance sheet and underwrite a new business plan. Northern Rock was down 6 percent. WORST MONTH SINCE LATE 2002? European shares rose to a 6-1/2 year high in July and then tumbled 13 percent in one month as credit market fears intensified. Then they recovered thanks to U.S. rate cuts, but have had a torrid November, falling nearly 8 percent to put the index on track for its worst month since December 2002, before a global equities bull run began. On Monday, Swiss Re joined a growing list of financial companies -- including Citigroup Inc, Merrill Lynch & Co Inc and Morgan Stanley -- that have reported huge losses from worsening conditions in consumer credit and capital markets. Swiss Re shares were down 2.2 percent after being stopped on sharp falls following brokerage downgrades. Among gainers, shares in Spanish construction firm Ferrovial , owner of British airports operator BAA, rose 4 percent after Britain's aviation regulator said London's Heathrow airport might be allowed to charge airlines 15.6 percent more next year. Shares in Bayer and Merck KGaA rose more than 3 percent to lead gainers in Germany's benchmark DAX index as investors snapped up companies with stable earnings. Analysts said they expected one of the next triggers to be a rate cut in the United States. "We think that recent news coming out of the Fed are clearly tipping the balance to another rate cut, presumably at the beginning of December," said Franz Wenzel, strategist at AXA Investment Managers, in Paris. Around Europe, Germany's DAX index was up 1.2 percent, the UK's FTSE 100 index up 0.9 percent and France's CAC 40 up 0.3 perce
