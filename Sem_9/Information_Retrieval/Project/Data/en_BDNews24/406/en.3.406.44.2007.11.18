 BERLIN, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sweden's Stefan Nystrand broke a world record for the second time in two days when he swam 20.93 seconds in the 50 metres freestyle at a short course World Cup meeting on Sunday. Nystrand, who broke the 100m freestyle world record on Saturday, was inside the previous 50m best of 20.98 set by Roland Schoeman of South Africa in Hamburg in 2006. Schoeman finished Sunday's race in second place. It was the second world record to fall on Sunday after Thiago Pereira of Brazil clocked 1:53.14 for the men's 200m individual medley, bettering the previous mark of 1:53.31 set by American Ryan Lochte in Shanghai last year. That made it four world records in total at the two-day World Cup event in Berlin. Marleen Veldhuis of the Netherlands set a new best time of 23.58 in the women's 50m freestyle on Saturday
