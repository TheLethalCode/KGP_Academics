<TITLE> Lloyd blames West Indies' board for decline </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Nov 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Under Clive Lloyd, West Indies won 23 tests between 1979 and 1985 with 21 draws and only three losses, a losing percentage of 6.4 percent. Between April 2003 and June 2006 West Indies, under three different captains, lost 61.7 percent of their matches. In an interview Lloyd told Reuters the reasons for the precipitous decline could be traced to inaction and complacency on the part of the West Indies Cricket Board. "We wanted to improve our cricket but we didn't put systems in place. Now we are trying in the Caribbean to harness the talent. We are getting the colleges and universities involved in our cricket. "We have exposed more cricketers and with the university now and with the academy, we are going to be teaching kids all aspects of things. On-the-field stuff and off-the-field, so that we are hoping that we will have well-rounded cricket which is needed in this day and age with the different games and different regulations. "You are playing for an association that is going back for years. West Indies cricket has always been at the high echelons of the sport and now we have been languishing at the bottom for quite a long while. Years ago in the '70s and the '80s if you didn't make runs against the West Indies you weren't classed as a great player or a good player. We now want to bring that back." Questions and answers: What was the legacy of this year's World Cup in the West Indies? "At least we have world-class stadiums, 14 of them or something like that. Because teams don't play that many games outside test matches I wonder how many of them might be white elephants." Would it help if more West Indians played in English county cricket? "In county cricket you realise the tactics of the game, how to get into a winning position, or to put yourself in a winning position, how to work yourself into an innings Our guys have played a lot of international cricket but they are learning on the job. In county cricket you can spend 17 days in a row just playing cricket." The West Indies' fast bowlers of the 1980s never seemed to get injured. Now every country seems to have a permanent injury list of pace bowlers. Why? "They don't play as often. They say fellows will last longer if they play less cricket. Not necessarily. You lose that momentum, that competitiveness and that edge." West Indies have always been a group of separate nations playing as one team. An attempt at political federation failed in the 1950s, is it time to try again? "I always thought if something didn't work you should try again. To me it would be a much more together place if we were thinking as one, because the only thing we do as one is play cricket. It could have given our region a lift. One dollar, one flag and one anthem. "We have to try and look at the bigger picture. If we could do that then the region would be a much better place." Does cricket have a global future or will it remain a sport with passionate devotees in a small number of countries? "I tried to get an Africa Cup: Zimbabwe, Namibia and Kenya. Gambia. An Africa Cup could be something that could unearth a lot of talent. All these things I put forward but they just get shot down because I'm not in a position to see it through." What other innovations would help the game? "Retractable roofs. Gone are the days when rain should stop play. People pay 50 pounds ($102) or 60 pounds and rain stops play. Melbourne Telstra stadium is a tremendous stadium. To me it's just like having an umbrella." You have been captain, coach and manager. What do you see as your future role? "When I'm too old then I'll pass the ball on. I will do as much as I can to get our cricket back on to an even keel. That is my goal." Finally, did you deliberately drop Geoff Boycott in the 1979 World Cup final because it suited you to keep him at the wicket? (England opener Boycott and captain Mike Brearley put on 129 for the first wicket but batted far too slowly to give their side a realistic chance of overhauling West Indies 286 for nine). (Laughs) "I don't know, it was just probably my excuse to say keep him in there. The two of them looked like they just wanted to prove they could play our pace but they forgot it was a one-day game.
