 DURBAN, South Africa, Nov 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa paceman Dale Steyn has been rewarded for his brilliant performances in the test series triumph over New Zealand with a spot in the one-day squad to play three matches against the Black Caps. Steyn, who took 20 wickets in the two-test series, replaces all rounder Justin Kemp as the only change to the squad that defeated Pakistan in a one-day series last month. "Dale gives us an exciting extra option as a wicket-taking bowler," selection chief Joubert Strydom was quoted as saying in a Cricket South Africa media release on Tuesday. The same squad has been named for a one-off Twenty20 match against New Zealand in Johannesburg on Friday. However, Morne van Wyk is on standby for Herschelle Gibbs, who injured a knee during the second test in Centurion. South Africa won the first test by 358 runs and wrapped up the series 2-0 by winning the second test by an innings and 59 runs. The first one-day international will be played in Durban on Sunday. Squad: Graeme Smith (captain), Herschelle Gibbs, Jacques Kallis, AB de Villiers, JP Duminy, Mark Boucher, Shaun Pollock, Albie Morkel, Vernon Philander, Johan Botha, Andre Nel, Charl Langeveldt, Makhaya Ntini, Dale Steyn
