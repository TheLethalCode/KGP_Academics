 Dhaka, Nov 19 (bdnews24.com)  The police Monday seized former prime minister Sheikh Hasina's Mercedes-Benz car as evidence in the August 21 grenade attack case. The investigating officer, assistant superintendent of police Md Fazlul Kabir had it brought to the CID office from Hasina's Sudha Sadan home. Hasina's chauffer Alauddin Rana drove the car, accompanied by the Dhanmondi police chief. Kabir said the vehicle would be returned within 15 days. Dr Hasan Mahmud, special assistant to Hasina, told bdnews24.com: "Investigating officer Fazlul Kabir said the authorities would hold the car for 15 days for investigation." Hasan said the vehicle had long been neglected after the grenade attack but was later repaired for Hasina's safety. Most of the glass panes were changed during the repairs. CID officers also collected the damaged glass that had been stored. Kabir said the vehicle was needed in order to produce it in court as evidence, since it bore marks of assault. He said the vehicle should have been seized immediately after the August 21 incident, but Sudha Sadan did not permit it. Kabir told bdnews24.com, "We will speak to Awami League leaders Zillur Rahman, Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed and Saber Hossain Chowdhury in a day or two as a part of our probe into the August 21 attack." The Awami League chief had used the Mercedes-Benz on August 21, 2004 when an AL rally on Bangabandhu Avenue came under grenade attack in 2004. Frontline AL leader Ivy Rahman and 21 others were killed in the attack. bdnews24.com/l
