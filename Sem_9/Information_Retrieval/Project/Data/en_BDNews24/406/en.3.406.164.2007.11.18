 Dhaka, Nov 18 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Sunday stayed for four weeks the Election Commission invitation to acting BNP secretary general Hafizuddin Ahmed to the electoral reforms dialogue. Corrected The court in the ruling on a petition by detained BNP chief Khaleda Zia also asked the top polls office and the government to explain in three weeks why the letter entailing the invitation would not be declared illegal. Senior counsel advocate TH Khan, who moved the appeal on behalf of Khaleda, briefed reporters after the court had frozen the efficacy of the letter. The High Court bench of justices Najmun Ara Sultana and Md Abu Tarique issued the order after hearing the writ petition. Barrister Nasir Uddin Ahmed Ashim filed the appeal on behalf of the former prime minister, now detained in special jail on graft charges. The petition also sought a ruling on the Election Commission to invite Khandaker Delwar Hossain to the dialogue instead of Hafizuddin. bdnews24.c
