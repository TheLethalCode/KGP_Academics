 Prodip Chowdhury bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, June 7 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka tribunal Thursday sentenced Giasuddin Al Mamun, a controversial businessman a controversial businessman and Channel 1 managing director, to three years in jail in a case filed by the Anti-Corruption Commission. The case came after Mamun failed to submit his wealth statement by the deadline to the corruption watchdog. Judge Ashraful Hossain of the Special Tribunal-5 handed down the verdict at 11:30am. The tribunal so far ruled on four persons who had failed to submit proper wealth statements in time. Three of them are still at large. For the first time, the tribunal, set up to fast-track a rash of corruption cases against politicians and businessmen during the state of emergency, gave the verdict in the presence of a convict. Earlier, a former Awami League MP from Narayanganj, Shamim Osman, was sentenced to three years in prison on April 30. Joynal Hazari from Feni got three years on May 13. And former prime minister Khaleda Zia's political secretary Harris Chowdhury was jailed on May 21. After an initial list of 50 corruption suspects was released on Feb 18, the ACC asked them to submit wealth statements within 72 hours from notification. As Mamun did not come up with a proper statement, ACC assistant director SM Akhter Hamid Bhuiyan filed a case with Special Judge's Court of Mohammad Mominullah. The court issued an arrest warrant against Mamun and another order to seize his wealth. Another complaint was filed on May 14 with the Special Judge's Court of Ashraful Hossain on top of early charges. Although Mamun's lawyers have said that two courts cannot deal with the same case, the court rejected all the arguments and fixed May 17 for Mamun to be present in court. Mamun defended himself and claimed that he was shown arrested two months later than the day he was, which is Jan 31. He alleged that he was threatened with 'crossfire' in secret custody. He said he could not submit statements duly as he was detained for long. The tribunal then decided to hear from editors and reporters from three newspapers on a report that Mamun was detained on Jan 31. But none of the journalists was present on May 31, a date fixed by the court. bdnew
