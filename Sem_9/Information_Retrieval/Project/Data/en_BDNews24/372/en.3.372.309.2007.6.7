 CHTOURA, Lebanon, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Lebanese security forces found three car bombs in eastern Lebanon on Thursday, a day after they arrested three suspected al Qaeda members in possession of weapons and explosives, security sources said. Security forces conducted raids in the Bar Elias village just west of the border with Syria in the Bekaa Valley after the men, arrested there, had admitted to rigging the cars, the sources said. The three men were found to be in possession of forged travel and identity documents, computers, maps of Lebanese cities and night vision binoculars. Security forces also found explosives in suitcases and guns. The nationalities of the three could not immediately be confirmed. The potential for Sunni Muslim militancy is on the rise in Lebanon as an al Qaeda-inspired militant group, Fatah al-Islam, is battling the Lebanese army at a Palestinian refugee camp in northern Lebanon. The group has threatened to expand its fight to other areas of Lebanon and beyond if the army does not halt a 19-day-old attack. At least 115 people have been killed in the fighting
