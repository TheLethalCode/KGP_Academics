<TITLE> New tariffs to hit local industry: CPD </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jun 8 (bdnews24.com)  The Centre for Policy Dialogue Friday said implementation of the proposed restructuring of the tariff line could cost domestic industry dear. "There is a high possibility that the proposed restructuring of tariff, notwithstanding being progressive in nature, may create an anti-domestic bias," said Debapriya Bhattacharya, executive director of the nongovernmental think-tank, at a media briefing on the budget. Finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Md Azizul Islam Thursday unveiled a Tk 87,137 crore budget for fiscal 2007-08 aimed at pleasing all sections of society with emphasis on curbing inflation, reducing inequalities and boosting agricultural output. But CPD said local industry, the second major contributor to GDP after the services sector, appears to bear the brunt of the proposed duty restructuring measures. The adviser placed the duty slabs at 10 percent, 15 percent and 25 percent instead of the existing 5 percent, 12 percent and 25 percent. He also proposed complete withdrawal of a 4 percent infrastructure development surcharge, keeping a 25 percent duty on imported finished goods. "We ask the National Board of Revenue to make a product-wise analysis so that the total duty on raw and intermediate goods do not exceed the prices of imported finished products," the CPD executive said. Local industries that import raw materials and intermediate goods at 5 percent and 12 percent will face a 10 percent and 15 percent duty. The CPD commended the adviser for his efforts to present a transparent and balanced budget that attempted to address the needs of most sectors. But the research centre has said economic successes will depend largely on the acceleration of investment. It also pointed to the risk of poor implementation of the budget if the shortfall in financing the budget deficit is not met. Islam planned to finance a deficit of 5.6 percent of GDP by accelerating revenue collections, domestic borrowing and foreign aid. "Implementation of the budget depends largely on the collection of funds. This appears to be a major challenge," Bhattacharya said, citing the low pace of revenue collections, an increase in domestic borrowing and a downturn in foreign financing in the previous fiscal year. Moreover, a shortfall in foreign aid may increase bank borrowing resulting in further increase to the interest payment burden. "The target for revenue generation may not be met," Bhattacharya said. The CPD warned the government of the danger of further inflation due to increased public spending. "Bangladesh Bank needs to restrict money supply growth to a reasonable level to effectively curb inflation," he said. Bhattacharya praised the government for focusing on agriculture, a power and social safety net, although he remained critical of the combined allocation to education and religion, low allowances for beneficiaries of the social safety net and taxes on knowledge-based institutions. bdnews
