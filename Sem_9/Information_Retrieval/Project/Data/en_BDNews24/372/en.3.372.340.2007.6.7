 Dhaka, June 7 (bdnews24.com) - The 2007-08 national budget proposes an allocation of Tk 6.22 crore for the civil aviation and tourism ministry, which was a 2.06 percent decline from the allocation in the outgoing fiscal year. In the 2006-07 fiscal year, the sector was given Tk 3.68 crore, which was later revised up to Tk 6.35 crore. Finance adviser AB Mirza Md Azizul Islam Thursday said: "The prospective national flag carrier has become loss-making due to administrative weaknesses." "The organisation is now undergoing financial and administrative restructuring. Decision has already been taken to turn Biman Bangladesh Airlines into a public limited company. I hope Biman will soon become an efficient organisation." bdnews24
