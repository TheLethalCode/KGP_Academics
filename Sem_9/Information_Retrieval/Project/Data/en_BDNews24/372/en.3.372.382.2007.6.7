<TITLE> Aeroflot may revive $2 bln deal with Boeing: source </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia's flagship airline Aeroflot may revive a $2 billion deal to buy 22 Boeing 787 jets, but will not scrap an earlier deal to buy 22 planes from Airbus, a company source said on Thursday. "Our talks with Boeing do not mean we will cancel the deal with Airbus. We have been saying for a long time that we can exploit both models," the source said. The deal between state-controlled Aeroflot and Boeing for 22 787 Dreamliner planes was frozen in 2006 due to what analysts said were worsening political relations between Moscow and Washington. Kommersant business daily on Thursday cited industry sources as saying the deal with Boeing will be revived at Russia's landmark economic forum in St Petersburg on Saturday with Boeing and Aeroflot signing a deal for the delivery of planes. Boeing will also sign a protocol to expand its cooperation with Russia's Sukhoi corporation. Aeroflot declined official comment. The source told Reuters he could not confirm the deal will be signed in St Petersburg. In March, Aeroflot announced plans to buy 22 planes from rival producer Airbus despite the fact that the first A350 aircraft may be delivered much later than 2010 -- a deadline that Boeing had said it would be able to meet. Boeing is already consulting Sukhoi on the design, marketing and production of a Sukhoi Superjet regional airliner and will expand its involvement by agreeing to create personnel training and servicing centres. Kommersant quoted industry experts as saying the reversal of Russia's position towards Boeing was politically motivated and followed Moscow's failure to gain a bigger involvement in EADS, the parent company of Airbus. Russian state-controlled bank VTB has a five percent stake in EADS. France and Germany are EADS's top shareholders. Boeing, which was initially ready to supply Aeroflot with its first Dreamliners by 2010, says its production is now fully booked until 2014. Aeroflot's top competitor in Russia, S7, formerly Sibir airlines, last week signed a deal for 15 Dreamliners with the first deliveries expected by 2014. Aeroflot is keen to buy as many foreign planes as possible to retire its old Soviet fleet
