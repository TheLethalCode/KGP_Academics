 LONDON, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nearly half of patients in England are starting hospital treatment within the government's 18-week target after being referred by their GP, the Department of Health said on Thursday. The government wants the 18-week target to be met for all patients across the NHS by the end of next year. The longest waits are for orthopaedics, oral surgery and neural surgery. Among the shortest are those for cardiothoracic surgery and gastroenterology. The March figure of 48 percent of patients represents an improvement on the performance of hospitals last year which were only admitting 35 percent within the 18 weeks. However, the March data also showed that one in eight patients had waited more than a year. Health Minister Andy Burnham said waiting times were falling across the country, adding that the figures showed the NHS was on course "to end waiting lists." He said achieving the 18-week target next year would be "the culmination of a 10-year programme to deal with waiting that the government began in 1997." The government's drive on waiting list targets has been criticised for distorting patient care. The Conservatives have said they would scrap targets and focus instead on health outcomes. But Burnham said he did not believe there was a need for any more targets to be set after the 18-week goal was met in 2008. He said achieving it would allow hospitals to focus on other local priorities, such as improving the quality of health care. Thursday's figures show for the first time how long patients wait between referral and the start of treatment. Current targets only relate to parts of this "patient journey" and exclude time spent waiting for diagnostic tests. Patients at present have a maximum waiting time of 13 weeks between seeing their GP and their first outpatient appointment. There is also a maximum six-month waiting time between a consultant's decision they should be treated and the start of that treatment. The data shows great variation across the health service, both by area and speciality. Three-fifths of patients in the East Midlands strategic health authority met the 18-week target in March, while the South East Coast authority only met the target for a third of its patients. The NHS Confederation, representing over 90 percent of NHS organisations, sounded a warning over optimism within the health service that the 18-week target would be met by December 2008. "We must not forget that this is probably the most challenging target that the health service has been asked to take on," said the confederation's director of policy, Nigel Edwards. "Meeting the target will require many NHS trusts to completely redesign how patients flow through the system," he said
