 COPENHAGEN, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UEFA have handed Sweden a 3-0 win in their abandoned Euro 2008 qualifier with Denmark, the European soccer governing body said on their Web site on Friday. UEFA also fined the Danish Football Association (DBU) 100,000 Swiss Francs ($81,630) and ordered Denmark to play their next four home Euro 2008 qualifiers at least 250 km (155 miles) from Copenhagen. The first of those games, against Liechtenstein on Sept. 12, will also have to be played behind closed doors. The DBU said it would appeal the decision. Denmark had rallied from 3-0 down to 3-3 at home last Saturday but the match was abandoned in the 89th minute when a drunken fan ran onto the pitch and attacked referee Herbert Fandel after the German awarded Sweden a penalty. Sweden now lead Group F with 18 points from seven matches, with Spain three points behind. Denmark trail in fourth place on 10 points from six matches. The DBU said UEFA wanted to make an example out of Denmark and that the punishment was too harsh. "I'm not sure that they were aware of the size of this country," DBU general secretary Jim Stjerne Hansen said at a news conference. "They might as well have told us to play abroad. Esbjerg is the only option more than 250 km away, but it doesn't have appropriate security standards for international matches." A seaside town of 70,000 on the west coast of Jutland, Esbjerg's first division soccer team plays in a stadium of 15,000 capacity, only about 5,000 of which are seats. Standing room areas are not allowed at UEFA international matches. But Swedish Football Association chairman Lars-Ake Lagrell said the punishment was within the rules. "When a match is abandoned it's a question of who is in charge," he told Reuters. "That was not us, that was outside of our responsibilities. Denmark lost the result completely according to regulations." Dane Christian Poulsen, who prompted the penalty and was sent off for punching Markus Rosenberg, was banned for three competitive internationals, UEFA said. Poulsen said he accepted his punishment in a statement on the DBU website. The DBU said it would start a civil lawsuit against the fan who disrupted the match and would issue refunds to those who have already bought tickets to the Liechtenstein game
