<TEXT>
 LONDON, June (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Darcey Bussell bows out on Friday at her spiritual home, London's Royal Opera House, after more than 15 years as the queen of British ballet. Not since Margot Fonteyn in the 1950s and 1960s has a ballerina enjoyed a public profile to rival that of Bussell who, at 38, is retiring at her peak. Her performance at a tribute last month in London drew breathless praise from critics marvelling at her 'ferocious physicality,' 'technique as fearless as a teenager's' and 'most perfect of ballet bodies.' Bussell first attracted attention when, aged just 19, she was plucked from the corps de ballet by renowned choreographer Kenneth MacMillan for the leading role in a new work. Within months she had been promoted to the rank of principal dancer at the Royal Ballet and quickly became the favourite of the Opera House audience. Her good looks and charm helped turn Bussell into a household name -- a painting of her hangs in London's National Portrait Gallery -- and her recovery following the birth of her first child raised her profile further. Tall for a ballerina, Bussell is renowned for her smooth technique, athleticism and fine characterisation. "In the spotlight she remains a shimmering figure, apparently boneless and weightless, an image of unearthly perfection," The Guardian said in December. Born in London, Bussell started dancing aged five and joined the Royal Ballet school at 13 before being accepted into the company at London's Sadler's Wells. MacMillan had spotted the willowy teenager while she was a student and caused a sensation by choosing her for the leading role in his 'Prince of the Pagodas.' "He needed a new muse. I was lucky. I was in the right place at the right time," Bussell has said. Along with French ballerina Sylvie Guillem, Bussell - who was coached by Fonteyn when she danced Swan Lake aged 20 - reinvigorated the Royal Ballet. By 1991 the New York Times was referring to her as 'a choreographer's dream.' Her career was interrupted in her early 30s by the arrival of her first child. One morning Bussell experienced violent pains while exercising and daughter Phoebe was born seven weeks early, leaving her mother dangerously ill with pre-eclampsia. She was off stage for a year and says having a family changed her perspective and removed the stress of performance. After the birth of her second daughter Zoe in 2004, Bussell decided to give up her full-time role at the Opera House. Her final performance on Friday -- dancing MacMillan's Song of the Earth to the music of Gustav Mahler -- will be televised live on BBC television. After performing in Viva la Diva, a 'fusion of song and dance' with opera singer Katherine Jenkins in November and December, she is expected to move next year to Australia with her Australian-born husba
