<TEXT>
 TEHRAN, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran is investigating a fourth Iranian-American citizen detained on security-related accusations, Iran's ISNA news agency reported on Friday. Iran has charged two dual nationals with spying and a third is being investigated for "anti-revolutionary" activities. (update) The United States has said Iran was holding Ali Shakeri, a Californian businessman, but until now Iran had not confirmed his case was being investigated. "The case of Ali Shakeri ... is now being investigated in the assistance office of Tehran's public prosecutor," ISNA reported adding the investigation involved "security-related charges". ISNA did not give a source for the statement. The United States has dismissed accusations against all four of those detained and demanded they be freed immediately. The Iranian judiciary said on May 29 that academic Haleh Esfandiari, social scientist Kian Tajbakhsh and journalist Parnaz Azima were accused of spying. A judicial source later said Azima had been detained for cooperating with "anti-revolutionary" media but then released on bail. Some analysts have linked the detention of the dual nationals to a row with Washington over the arrest of five Iranians in Iraq by US forces in January. Tehran insists the five are diplomats and has demanded their release. Washington says the men were backing militants in Iraq. Washington and Tehran are also at loggerheads over Iran's nuclear programme which Washington says is aimed at building atomic bombs -- a charge Tehran denies. Despite the rows between the two arch-foes, US and Iranian officials held rare face-to-face talks in Baghdad last month to discuss security issues in Iraq
