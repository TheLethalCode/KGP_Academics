 Dhaka, June 07 (bdnews24.com) - The interim government has proposed in the proposed budget to widen the social safety net to speed up the poverty reduction pace. The safety net comprises senior citizen's allowance, allowance for destitute widows, honorarium for insolvent freedom fighters, assistance to disabled persons, seasonal employment generation fund, test relief, food for works programme, gratuitous relief (GR), VGF and VGD etc. In the FY 2007-08, the allocation for 'senior citizen allowance' has been proposed to be enhanced to Tk 220 from Tk 200 and the number of beneficiaries to 17 lakh from 16 lakh for the outgoing year. The government has proposed to raise the allowance for destitute widows to Tk 220 in the upcoming fiscal from Tk 200 in 2006-07 and increase the number of beneficiaries to 7.5 lakh from 6.5 lakh in FY 2006-07. Monthly allowance for widows and destitutes has also been proposed to be raised from the current Tk 200 to Tk 220 in the budget. The benefit package for disabled freedom fighters has been proposed to be enhanced to Tk 600 from Tk 500 per month. Construction of residential flats for freedom fighters has also been proposed. Assistance to disabled persons has been proposed at Tk 220 from Tk 200 of the outgoing fiscal and the benefit coverage at two lakh from 1.66 lakh people. Some Tk 550 crore has been proposed for employment generation to help the marginalised poor suffering from geographical and natural constraints like 'monga' and river erosion. In addition, more food grains would be earmarked for rural infrastructure maintenance programme (test relief), food for works programme, gratuitous relief (GR), VGF and VGD. In FY 2007-08, the government would import some eight lakh tonnes of food grains. Four lakh tonnes of rice would be allocated for five million cardholders to provide subsistence coverage for eight months. Along with this allocation, about six lakh tonnes of food grains will be distributed through TR, GR FWP and VGD programmes. The government has also introduced a pilot programme for poor lactating mothers. The programme will ensure safe motherhood, better health and nutrition of hardcore poor mothers. The expecting poor mothers will get an allowance of Tk 300 per month. Initially, 45,000 mothers of 3,000 unions will come under the programme. Currently, the direct and indirect gender equality expenditure taken together accounts for 22 percent of the total budget. In the next fiscal year, the government has proposed to increase this share to 24 percent. Meanwhile, in the proposed budget there is no allocation for housing the homeless although there was allocation under this head in the outgoing budget. bd
