 LONDON, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks hit their lowest in three weeks on Thursday in volatile trade, wiping out earlier gains, with investment banks UBS and Credit Suisse featuring among losers on interest rate concerns. Vodafone however rose 2 percent after it was urged by an activist investment group to free up as much as 38 billion pounds from its assets to return to shareholders. France Telecom eased 0.7 percent as the stock traded ex-dividend and talk swirled that the French government could be looking to sell part of its stake. By 0830 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 0.1 percent at 1,588.1 after falling as low as 1,582.5, extending Wednesday's 1.6 percent fall. Earlier on Thursday, the index rose as much as 0.6 percent within minutes of opening. "Markets are still jittery about inflation and banks are under pressure. People are keen to take profits after the gains we have seen," said a trader. The index has lost as much as 2.7 percent this week but is still up 7 percent so far this year on robust earnings and a boom in mergers and acquisitions. The Bank of England's interest rate decision at 1100 GMT tops investors' agendas, a day after the European Central Bank raised rates to 4.0 percent and showed its readiness to hike again. "There's a strong base effect due to oil prices and probably inflation rates will start to diminish in the second half of this year," said Thierry Lacraz, a strategist at Pictet & Cie. "The M&A theme will continue as long as global conditions are still favourable. M&A will remain for the next 12 months a key support for equity markets." Around Europe, London's FTSE 100 rose 0.4 percent, Paris's CAC-40 lost 0.2 percent and Frankfurt's DAX edged up 0.1 percent. Equity markets are beginning to take note of rising bond yields with benchmark 10-year US Treasury yields briefly piercing above 5 percent for the first time since mid-August. "Increased rate expectations globally have finally started to impact on equity markets and concerns are starting to build about the impact that rising bond yields will ultimately have on global growth," analysts at Fox-Pitt, Kelton said in a note. Among gainers, GlaxoSmithKline shares gained 1.2 percent following news Takeda will add a boxed warning to the US label of its diabetes drug Actos -- the main rival to Glaxo's Avandia -- to increase awareness of the risk of congestive heart failure
