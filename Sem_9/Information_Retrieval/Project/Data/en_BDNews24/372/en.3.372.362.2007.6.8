 BEIRUT, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A bomb exploded at a Christian industrial area north of Beirut on Thursday night, killing one civilian and wounding four others, security sources said. They said the explosive charge was placed near or under a car in the Zouk Mosbeh area, causing a fire and extensive damage. It was the fifth explosion to rock the Beirut area since May 20, when Lebanese troops and al Qaeda-inspired militants began battles at a Palestinian refugee camp in north Lebanon. The previous four blasts killed one person and wounded dozens of others. Fatah al-Islam militants fighting the army, who had denied responsibility for the previous blasts, on Wednesday threatened to take their fight to other areas of Lebanon and beyond. Lebanese soldiers and firefighters rushed to the scene of the blast at Zouk. One large fire was put out some 90 minutes after it was started by the explosion. One building was badly damaged and several cars destroyed
