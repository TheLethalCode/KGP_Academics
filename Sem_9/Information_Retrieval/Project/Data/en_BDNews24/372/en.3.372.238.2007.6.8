 LONDON, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British brewer and pubs owner Fuller, Smith & Turner Plc met forecasts with a 23 percent rise in underlying annual profit and said on Friday it continued to be bullish about future trading. "The current financial year has started well and is in line with expectations," Chairman Anthony Fuller said in a statement. Chief Executive Michael Turner forecast further growth and said the ban on smoking in workplaces in England from July would affect Fuller's less than its competitors. "We have been working for a long time to improve the fresh food offer in all our pubs. This will place us very well for the smoking ban which will affect everybody but will affect Fuller's less," Turner said. The firm, famous for its London Pride and ESB beers, pubs and bars, made a pretax profit before exceptional items of 22.1 million pounds ($44 million) in the 52 weeks to end-March, on revenue up 23 percent to 178 million pounds. Including a 20.1 million pounds gain from property sales, Fuller's made a pretax profit of 42.3 million pounds. "It has been an exceptional year, boosted by the addition of a full year's contribution from the Gales business, the profits generated from the sale of two hotels, and strong underlying growth," Anthony Fuller said. The final dividend was raised 15 percent to 16.25 pence, making the total dividend 15 percent higher at 22.72 pence. "At the moment they are top of the class as far as trading is concerned, especially in terms of asset quality and re-leveraging opportunity," an analyst at a British brokerage said. "These guys are performing ahead of the competition, they are getting much higher growth," he added. Panmure Gordon analyst Douglas Jack said Fuller's statement that full-year like-for-like sales at managed uninvested pubs rose 6.7 percent implied second-half growth of 9.2 percent so "we are reiterating our 'buy' stance". Panmure has a 2,100 pence price target for Fuller's stock. Fuller's proposed a five-for-two share split to enhance liquidity. Its shares were unchanged at 1,883 pence by 0820 GMT to value the company at 244 million pounds
