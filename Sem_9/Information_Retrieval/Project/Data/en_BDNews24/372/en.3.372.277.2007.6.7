 BRUSSELS, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Belgian voters are set to end Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt's eight years in office in Sunday's election and replace him with the premier of Dutch-speaking Flanders, who wants to devolve yet more power to the regions. Ten parties or groupings have a realistic chance of seats in the federal parliament and the multitude of possible coalitions means Belgium's political future may not be clear when results stream in after polls close at 3 p.m. (1300 GMT). "There are all sorts of potential coalitions ... The polls have been pretty stable though, so what you can say is that Verhofstadt's liberals look like being the big losers," said Peter Thijssen, political scientist at Antwerp University. The election campaign has taken on a presidential flavour, with Verhofstadt lined up against his principal challenger, Yves Leterme, the Christian Democrat Flemish premier. Verhofstadt says his government's tax cuts pushed economic growth to 3 percent last year, above the euro zone average and the highest since 2000. He has promised further income tax cuts if re-elected. Leterme says Verhofstadt cannot be trusted, arguing that higher indirect taxes have left Belgians no better off, while public debt has been cut mainly by one-off expedients such as the sale of state property. The Flemish premier also sees scope to cut taxes, but his key message is that the regions, and particularly Flanders, need greater control over their own destinies in areas such as labour market policy, health, justice and taxation. The two have clashed in television debates, most recently on Sunday with Johan Vande Lanotte, the socialist leader in Flanders viewed as a possible alternative for premier. The socialists and liberals are currently partners in government. The prime minister usually comes from Flanders, where almost 60 percent of Belgians live, but must lead a government including members from the French-speaking region of Wallonia. There, Leterme has a problem. His remark last year that French-speakers in Flanders were apparently not bright enough to learn Dutch still sticks in francophone throats. While he is the number one choice for Flemings, some 30 percent of whom are forecast to vote for his party, only about 4 percent of Walloons favour him, according to a recent poll. The Socialist Party is likely to remain the biggest force in French-speaking Wallonia, its rust-belt bastion, albeit with a much reduced share of about 31 percent of the vote following embezzlement scandals in a number of local councils. The future government needs a simple majority of the seats in the lower house of parliament, but in practice coalitions seek majorities in both the Dutch- and French-speaking regions. The most likely combination appears to be the Flemish Christian Democrats and their francophone sister party with the two socialist groups. Analysts do not exclude an alliance of the three mainstream parties from each linguistic community, or with the resurgent Greens, to keep out the far-right Flemish nationalist Vlaams Belang party, which is set to increase its number of seats. The outcome is only partly in the hands of the country's 7 million voters, who are obliged to casts ballots in a proportional representation electoral system by region. "Campaigning is short in Belgium. Forming a government, particularly this time, may take another three months," said Marc Swyngedouw, professor of politics at the Catholic University of Leuven
