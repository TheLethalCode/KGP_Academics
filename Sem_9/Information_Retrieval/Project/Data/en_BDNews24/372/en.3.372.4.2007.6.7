 LONDON, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Bank of England held interest rates at a six-year high of 5.5 percent on Thursday, as expected, but most economists predict another rise before long. Only five out 58 analysts in a Reuters poll had predicted an increase this week, a month after the central bank raised borrowing costs for the fourth time since last August. But markets have fully priced in a rise to 5.75 percent this summer as all 9 Monetary Policy Committee members agreed last month that a rate rise on top of May's quarter percentage point move would probably be needed. Some policymakers even considered a 50 basis points increase at the May meeting. They have also made clear they are worried about rising price pressures. Annual inflation has slipped from its series high of 3.1 percent in March but is still running way above the central bank's 2 percent target. Business surveys have been showing firms increasingly confident about raising their prices, and consumer spirits are high despite the full percentage point rise in borrowing costs over the past year. The KPMG/REC jobs report on Wednesday showed permanent staff wages in May rose at their fastest rate since June 2000, when British interest rates were at 6 percent and the world economy was booming on the back of the dotcom bubble. Even the MPC's arch-dove David Blanchflower said he saw upside risks to inflation as he explained why he backed last month's decision to increase interest rates, only 2 months after voting for a cut. But there are some early signs that the housing market is slowing. A survey by the Halifax on Thursday showed house prices rising at their weakest monthly pace this year in May, even though the annual rate of inflation remains in double-digits
