<TITLE> Cambodia approves night shifts for garment workers </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PHNOM PENH, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cambodia approved new labour laws on Friday allowing night shift work, a move that should boost its garment industry, which accounts for two thirds of the impoverished southeast Asian nation's exports. "We need to create more jobs and to support the growing demands of global markets on our garment industry," Labour Minister Vong South said after parliament passed the amended laws. He said the amendments should help create between 150,000 and 200,000 new jobs in the sector, worth $2.6 billion in exports last year out of a national total of $3.7 billion. The International Labor Organisation (ILO) estimates that between 250,000 and 300,000 Cambodians are entering the job market each year, putting pressure on the administration of Prime Minister Hun Sen to get them into employment. Ken Loo, secretary general of the Garment Manufacturers' Association in Cambodia (GMAC), said workers and the foreign investors who have helped create the industry from next to nothing 10 years ago should benefit. "It will not only generate more jobs for Cambodia in general but will also allow Cambodia to compete with the international markets. The night shift means we can double our production with the same capital investment," he said. Cambodia's garment industry has blossomed since the country joined the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in 2004, defying predictions it would be unable to compete with cheaper producers such as China and India. The 301 factories that now ring the capital, most of them owned by Taiwanese, Hong Kong, Chinese and South Korean investors, are a key driver of a surprise boom in the economy, which is now growing at around 9 percent a year. The industry employs 350,000 workers, most of them young rural women earning an average monthly wage of $50. Under the new law, night-shift wages will have to be 130 percent higher, meaning workers will take home around $115 a month, more than double the average national per capita income. The ILO, which monitors working conditions in the factories to ensure they are not run like sweatshops, said the law and wage levels appeared to be acceptable. "Cambodia just falls in line of what is happening in most other countries," said its assistant country project manager, Conor Boyle. "It will definitely help Cambodia stay competitive.
