 Dhaka, June 7 (bdnews24.com)  The caretaker government has set a target to make the country free of power outages by 2010, finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said Thursday. "We have set a target to generate sufficient electricity by 2010 to reach a level where there will no load-shedding," the adviser said in his budget speech for fiscal 2007-08. In the proposed annual outlay, the government has allocated Tk 4,586 crore or 5.8 percent of the total budget, which means a 51 percent increase from the last year's revised budget of Tk 3,034 crore for the power and energy sector. The adviser said 600 mega watts electricity would be added to the national grid by year-end as the government moved to complete the maintenance of power generation plants. "We have planned to increase power generation over the next three years by 345 MW in the first year, 900 MW in the second year and 1,050 MW in the third year," the adviser said. He said policies have been made to buy electricity from the private sector-owned captive power plants. "Directives have been given to speed up the implementation of those projects which are scheduled to add electricity to the national grid by 2008/2009." In the current fiscal year, the government has provided a loan amounting to Tk 350 crore to the Power Development Board to settle the outstanding bills of independent power producers. An arrear of Tk 525 crore accumulated against different government and autonomous bodies and state-owned enterprises until December 2006. bdnews
