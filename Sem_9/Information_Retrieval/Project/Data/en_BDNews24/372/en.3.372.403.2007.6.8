 KINGSTON, Jamaica, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The investigating team that concluded former Pakistan cricket coach Bob Woolmer was murdered came under fire on Thursday. Pakistan's World Cup media manager PJ Mir said the handling of the case had been "deplorable." Reneto Adams, a senior police superintendent, told local television station CVM: "A hasty decision was arrived at in declaring this a murder." Sky Sports News in Britain had earlier quoted Jamaican police sources as saying Woolmer had died of natural causes. Mir, who was the third person from the Pakistan team management to see Woolmer's body on the floor of his hotel room in Kingston in March, told Sky Sports News: "What amazes me is, where on earth did the hint of murder come in? "We saw Bob lying on the floor there. There was no sign of violence. All of a sudden, the strangulation theory, the poison theory - all kinds of theories... It all started within a day." He added: "I want to know, where did all these theories come from, particularly the theory of murder? I think it's deplorable how it's all been handled." British media have been reporting that the Jamaica police will soon announce that Woolmer was not murdered, a suggestion that has not been denied by Jamaica police commissioner Lucius Thomas. He told journalists on Wednesday that a news conference would be held soon
