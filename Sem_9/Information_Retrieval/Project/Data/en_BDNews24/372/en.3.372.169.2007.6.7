 HEILIGENDAMM, Germany, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday the United States and Russia would have no difficulties if they work together openly on the divisive issue of missile defence. After meeting US President George W. Bush at a Group of Eight summit, Putin said through a translator that if Washington and Moscow cooperate transparently on missile defence "then we'll have no problems." A US official said on Thursday that Russian President Vladimir Putin had shown a willingness to cooperate on missile defence in talks with US President George W. Bush. "What we got was a willingness to do so (cooperate)," White House national security adviser Stephen Hadley told reporters. After meeting US President George W. Bush at a Group of Eight summit, Putin said through a translator that if Washington and Moscow cooperate transparently on missile defence "then we'll have no problems". Earlier, US President George W Bush sought to calm tensions with Moscow on Thursday ahead of a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a Group of Eight (G8) summit in Germany. "It is important for Russia and Russians to understand that I believe the Cold War ended, that Russia is not an enemy of the United States that there's a lot of areas where we can work together," Bush said, citing Iran and proliferation as examples. His conciliatory comments came as G8 leaders appeared to be nearing a consensus on the divisive issue of how best to combat global warming. British Prime Minister Tony Blair, after meeting with Bush, said he expected leaders to agree to make "substantial" cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, but said they would not fix a numerical target, like the 50 percent cut by 2050 that German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the summit host, has pushed for. Security remains tight around the summit venue, a luxury hotel in the small seaside town of Heiligendamm. On Thursday morning police power boats stopped two smaller craft trying to break through the security cordon, ramming one of them and dumping its occupants into the Baltic. At a morning session focused on economic issues, Merkel sat between Bush and Putin, who had engaged in public sparring on US missile shield plans in the run-up to the summit. The two presidents, smiling and looking relaxed, have not met face-to-face since before Putin launched an attack on the Bush administration in February, accusing it of trying to force its will on the world and become its "single master". "There's a lot of constructive work we can do and so I'm looking forward to my dialogue with Vladimir Putin this afternoon," Bush said on Thursday. Bush said he would reiterate to Putin his proposal to have Russia send generals and scientists to the United States to reassure them on his plans to put a radar system in the Czech Republic and interceptor missiles in Poland. Washington says the shield is intended as a defence against "rogue" states like Iran and North Korea and has urged Russia to cooperate, but been rebuffed by Moscow who suspects it could eventually be outfitted with attack missiles or used for spying. Relations between Russia and the West are at their lowest point since the Cold War, analysts say, because of the shield row and differences on human rights, democracy and independence for Serbian province Kosovo. Bush reiterated on Thursday that he did not think Russia posed a threat to Europe despite Putin's vow last week to target the continent if Washington goes ahead with the shield plans. The Kremlin also played down Putin's threat on Wednesday, saying they were hypothetical and just one option Russia was considering. The missile shield is not the only issue dividing Russia, the United States and fellow G8 members Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan. Other divisive topics include climate change, aid to Africa and a host of international issues on which they have differences, such as Iran's nuclear programme. Top G8 negotiators, the "sherpas", worked late into the night on Wednesday to try to hammer out a deal that could lead to an agreement on greenhouse gas cuts. "I think it's possible that we leave this summit with a commitment on the part of everyone to a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 as a global target," Blair said. There were no reports of major clashes between police and protesters overnight after demonstrators had temporarily blocked all roads in and out of Heiligendamm on Wednesd
