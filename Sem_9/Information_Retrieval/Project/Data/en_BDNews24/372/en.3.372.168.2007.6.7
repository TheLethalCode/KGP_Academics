 FRANKFURT, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares closed lower for a third consecutive day on Wednesday after the European Central Bank raised interest rates, fuelling concerns that further rate hikes might be on the way. Banking stocks weighed on the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index, which closed 1.59 percent down at 1,586.45 points, its lowest close since May 17. "This is down to interest rate worries and concern that liquidity could decline in the medium term. But we think this is exaggerated," said Sven Krause, fund manager at LBB Invest. The ECB lifted interest rates to a six-year high of 4 percent and showed its readiness to hike again to curb inflationary pressures in a strongly expanding economy. The Bank of England's rate decision will be in focus on Thursday. A report from Morgan Stanley added to the tension. The investment bank said that as of last Friday they had "a full house sell signal". "Our indicators are suggesting an equity market correction, and we are expecting one," it said. Around Europe, London's FTSE 100 index fell 1.66 percent, Frankfurt's DAX dropped 2.4 percent, and France's CAC 40 retreated 1.66 percent. Deutsche Bank dropped 2.5 percent amid market talk it had made a large loss in proprietary trading. The bank declined to comment, but a source close to the bank said the rumour of the trading loss was baseless. Northern Rock dropped 3.4 percent after JP Morgan downgraded the mortgage bank to "underweight" from "neutral". On the upside, Royal Bank of Scotland, which remain's JP Morgan's top pick, gained 0.7 percent and was among the top gainers on the DJ EuroStoxx 50 index. Also bucking the trend in a negative market was aero engine maker Rolls-Royce on the back of an upbeat note from Societe Generale, which reiterated its "buy" rating. The DJ Stoxx European car sector index fell 3.1 percent with BMW, DaimlerChrysler and Porsche down more than 3 percent each. "Automotive shares have generally performed really well since the beginning of the year and some will lock in profits now," one trader said. Chemical stocks also dragged down the market. Belgian drugs, chemicals and plastics maker Solvay dropped 5.1 percent as market sources said Morgan Stanley is placing shares. Morgan Stanley declined comment. Elsewhere BASF fell 4.1 percent, Wacker Chemie dropped 5.5 percent and Clariant fell 3.9 percent. The oil price rose above $71 per barrel, up 89 cents. Vodafone shares were down 3.8 percent as the share was trading ex-dividend
