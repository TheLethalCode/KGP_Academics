 ABUJA, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nigeria's Supreme Court refused bail on Friday to a former militia leader from the oil-producing Niger Delta whose release is demanded by armed groups in the region. The country's top court agreed with two rulings by lower courts that Mujahid Dokubo-Asari, who is on trial for treason, represented a threat to national security after calling for the disintegration of Africa's top oil producer. "The below court was right to deny bail ... as there is evidence that there was the existence of a threat to national security," said Justice Tanko Mohammed. Asari's release is one demand of a militant group, the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, whose bombings of oil facilities and kidnappings of foreign workers have reduced Nigerian oil exports by about a quarter. Defence lawyer Festus Keyamo said the continued detention of Asari, who has already spent 20 months behind bars while his trial is repeatedly adjourned without tackling any substantive issue, would only prolong the crisis in the delta. "We think the issues are bigger than Asari. He is only a symbol of the struggle," Keyamo said. President Umaru Yar'Adua, who took office last month, has promised to give the delta crisis his urgent attention. "We want to tell Yar'Adua that there will be no solution to the violence in the Niger Delta unless he resolves the trial of Asari," Keyamo said. The judge quoted from a newspaper interview in which Asari called for the disintegration of Nigeria, accused the government of being illegitimate and said members of his ethnic group, the Ijaw, would form their own country in the delta. Asari fought sporadic gun battles with troops from remote jungle camps in the delta in 2004, and his threats to blow up facilities helped drive oil prices above $50 a barrel for the first time. He turned over thousands of weapons to the government in return for amnesty at the end of that year, but was arrested on treason charges in September 2005
