 PARIS, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - France still have their work cut out to qualify for Euro 2008 despite being two points clear of world champions Italy at the top of Group B, according to coach Raymond Domenech. A Samir Nasri first-half goal gave France a 1-0 victory over Georgia on Wednesday, four days after the World Cup runners up beat Ukraine 2-0 at the Stade de France. With 18 points from seven games, Les Bleus are two points ahead of world champions Italy, who took a 2-0 victory in Lithuania. Ukraine are fourth on 12 points but have one game in hand. However France must travel to Italy on Sept. 8 before ending their qualifying campaign in Ukraine on Nov. 21. "I repeat, it will be tight until the end," Domenech told reporters on Wednesday. "We have not got back the points we lost in Scotland," he added, referring to France's 1-0 defeat in Glasgow last October. "We are still in the race but we are actually trailing the others. Ukraine are still the best placed team because they will plays hosts to Italy and France. "We are not qualified yet, we must achieve something in Italy or Ukraine." France beat Italy 3-1 last September, after losing to them on penalties in last year's World Cup final in Berlin. Olympique Lyon midfielder Florent Malouda, however, felt France were on the right path to the finals in Switzerland and Austria. "By winning these two matches (against Ukraine and Georgia), we did what we had to do," he said. "We now are in a good position before going to Italy. We now have to rest after a long, very long season. "San Siro will be another story. We will have time to focus on this game and get ready for it.
