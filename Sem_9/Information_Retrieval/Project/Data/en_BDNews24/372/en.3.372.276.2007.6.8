 LONDON, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil fell $1 towards $70 a barrel on Friday after Cyclone Gonu lost power allowing Gulf producer Oman to resume exports following a three-day halt. London Brent crude, seen as more representative of the global market, was down 88 cents at $70.34 a barrel at 1018 GMT, after dropping to $70.17. US crude fell 74 cents to $66.19. Oman's Mina al-Fahal, the country's only terminal for its 650,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude exports, resumed operations on Friday, a shipping source said. The price decline was limited, however, by concerns about whether US refiners can produce enough gasoline to meet demand in the summer months. "The market is in a phase of reacting to bullish items and discounting their non-confirmation," said Olivier Jakob of Petromatrix. Prices have also been underpinned by OPEC's reluctance to increase output. Brent crude almost matched the $71.80 high hit in late May after the president of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said on Thursday there was no need for an emergency meeting. Consumers have been urging the group to reconsider its current production ceiling. The market was also briefly unnerved on Thursday by a report Turkey was launching a major incursion into northern Iraq. A military source said troops had conducted a limited raid, but Turkey denied it was on a major scale. Adding to the sense supplies are precarious, Brazilian oil workers are threatening a five-day strike that could affect the country's 2.4 million bpd of production
