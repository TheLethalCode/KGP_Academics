 Dhaka, June 7 (bdnews24.com)  Finance adviser Mirza Azizul Islam Thursday proposed Tk 550 crore for employment generation in rural areas for the next fiscal year. The jobs creation efforts are outside the ministry-based programmes, he said in his budget speech. "Creation of increased employment opportunities is essential for social empowerment. "In order to help the marginalised poor suffering from geographical and natural constraints like monga and river erosion, extension of existing micro-credit programmes has been proposed," he said. Palli Karma Shahayak Foundation will use a significant part of the allocation through their associate NGOs. The allocation against the credit programmes and funds including other rural employment generating programmes will stand at about 9 percent of the total budget. "I expect that this will create employment opportunities in rural economy equivalent to 3 man-months for 95 lakh families in the next fiscal year."
