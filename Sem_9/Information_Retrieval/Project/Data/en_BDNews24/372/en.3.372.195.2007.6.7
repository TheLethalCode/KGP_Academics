<TITLE> N Korea fires missiles off west coast: Yonhap </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SEOUL, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - North Korea fired one or two short-range missiles off its west coast on Thursday, South Korea's Yonhap news agency quoted a government official as saying. "We suspect the number of missiles fired today was one or two. We are working to distinguish the types of missiles," the official told Yonhap. Normally, missiles fired off the west coast would land in the Yellow Sea. "Last month when the North fired one missile off the east coast, it had also tried to do the same thing off the west coast. It seems like they fired those which they had not fired at the time." An official at the office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff also told Reuters it was working with its intelligence authorities to confirm the report. North Korea fired one short-range missile off its east coast in late May, but South Korean and US officials downplayed it as part of regular military exercises
