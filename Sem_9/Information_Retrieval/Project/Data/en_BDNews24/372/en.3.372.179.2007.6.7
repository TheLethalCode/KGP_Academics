 Dhaka, June 7 (bdnews24.com)  Finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Thursday fleshed out a slew of positive measures as he rolled out a Tk 87,137 crore national budget, including Tk 7,523 crore liabilities of Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation. He forecast 7 percent GDP growth for fiscal 2007-08 and proposed Tk 1,100 crore in export subsidy. The budget targeted some common areas of concerntackling sprinting inflation, diesel subsidy for irrigation, spending more on power and infrastructure, widening the social safety net and driving agriculture. But the budget failed to satisfy manufacturers who said the government move to raise import duty on raw materials and intermediate goods was self-defeating and would hit the local industries hard. Leaders of the two political camps were cautious in their reactions to the full-year budget. Former BNP agriculture minister MK Anwar said the government laid out a "positive" budget for the agriculture sector. Awami League presidium member Ataur Rahman Khan Kaiser termed it a big budget and said it had increased the prices of essentials but did not create job opportunities. Prof MA Taslim, a teacher of Dhaka University, said: "The budget is not overly ambitious. It sensibly acknowledges the constraints of the difficult time that the nation is passing through." "Finance adviser Mirza Azizul Islam has laboured not to dash the high expectations raised by the rhetoric of poverty alleviation and good governance," the former chairman of Bangladesh Tariff Commission writes in an exclusive article for bdnews24.com. "This could not have been an easy task with declining domestic revenues and shrinking foreign grants and concessionary loans. The end result was the bringing down of the largest deficit budget in recent history," he said. Average inflation is expected to come down to 6.5 percent, the adviser said. Prices of essentials, such as edible oils and lentils, are expected to go down as the government proposed withdrawal of import duties on these items to curb inflationary pressure on the economy. As much as 25 percent of the proposed budget has been set aside for human resources development including education. The adviser proposed to widen the social safety net to force off the pace of poverty cuts, a 10.31 percent surge in health-sector funding to better healthcare services. The government has set aside Tk 550 crore for generating jobs in rural areas. He also proposed to make available Tk 750 crore in diesel subsidy for irrigation, raise the allocation for ICT sectors by 12 percent to Tk 1,899 crore to boost telecommunications and IT products export Plans are there to build over 18,000 classrooms and recruit 15,000 primary teachers, 60 percent of them women, bringing the current student-teacher ratio of 55:1 down to 46:1. The government also plans to computerise land records and reform land registration process. Mirza Azizul proposed Tk 6,864.25 crore for the defence ministry, a 6.16 percent rise from the outlay for the outgoing fiscal year. The interim government also announced a new medium term budget framework (MTBF), covering fourteen ministries, including the ministries of health, education, and agriculture. All ministries will eventually be brought under the MTBF in phases, enjoying increased autonomy in allocation and use of resources, and reducing delays and inefficiency. However, successful implementation of these reforms will require enhanced capacity of the line ministries. Special initiatives have been taken to ensure distribution of books and stationery free of cost to the extremely poor and in remote regions of the country, while 55 lakh primary students will be given a monthly stipend. Mirza Azizul also announced plans for expanding the capital market in fiscal 2007-08 by offloading shares from state-owned enterprises in the power, telecommunication and energy sectors. He announced incentives for mobile phone companies to come to the capital market. Cell phone operators will keep facing higher corporate tax unless they go public. Budget allocations for road maintenance and railway maintenance have been increased by 76.5 percent and 40 percent respectively. The technical project proposal for construction of the Padma Bridge has been approved. To improve the quality of services on the railway, management reforms are being strengthened apart from procurement of rolling stock, and other modern equipment. The budget has allocated Tk 20 crore in microcredit to generate employment opportunities for women, Tk 10 crore for the Fund for Acid-Burned Women and the Disabled, and Tk 25 crore for welfare of RMG workers and a further Tk 20 crore for their training. Employment opportunities for 24,000 destitute women in 387 unions will be created under the programme titled 'Rural Employment Opportunities for Protection of Public Property'. bd
