<TEXT>
 BRUSSELS, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European Union member states have narrowed differences over a planned new treaty for the bloc, Germany said on Thursday, raising hopes for an agreement at an EU summit on June 21-22. Germany, which holds the EU's six-month rotating presidency, hopes to clinch a preliminary deal at the summit on a treaty to replace the constitution rejected by France and the Netherlands in referendums in 2005. The EU's 27 members committed themselves in March to trying to secure a final agreement on the treaty by the end of this year. It is intended to overhaul the Union's institutions and make the bloc more efficient after following its enlargement. "The number of open questions has been substantially reduced," German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier told the European Parliament. Nicolas Sarkozy, who is now France's president, advocated adopting a "mini-treaty" last year but has since replaced this term with "simplified treaty" to placate the 18 EU states that have ratified the constitution. Diplomats say that under the emerging accord, the EU would have the long-term president and foreign minister provided by the constitution, but probably under different titles. It would have a streamlined, more democratic decision-making system but none of the trappings of statehood, they say. Poland wants changes to the voting system envisaged under the draft constitution and agreed by other EU members. Britain wants the constitution's charter of fundamental rights excluded, but Germany and others want a clause giving it legal force
