 MORONI, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Comoros has delayed an election due on Sunday on the mutinous island of Anjouan for one week after police there shot three civilians during political unrest, national radio said late on Thursday. The coup-prone Indian Ocean archipelago was due to elect local presidents for its three main islands. The authorities said polls would go ahead as planned this weekend on Grande Comore and Moheli, but Anjouan's would be postponed to June 17. "The security conditions are not sufficient in Anjouan to allow the elections to take place this Sunday," an official statement read on national radio said. All three islands will hold the second round of their ballots on June 24, it added. Three people were wounded on Tuesday when Anjouan police opened fire on a crowd waiting to meet a flight carrying the Comoros' federal president, Ahmed Abdullah Mohamed Sambi. The runway was blocked and Sambi forced to turn back. Tensions have risen sharply on the island since forces loyal to its then-leader Mohamed Bacar killed two federal soldiers in May. An envoy from the African Union, which brokered an end to that fighting, condemned Anjouan's leadership on Wednesday, saying the blocking of Sambi's flight had been "intolerable". The three islands, whose total population is about 670,000, retain autonomy via local presidencies under the terms of a 2001 peace deal and share a rotating national president. Sambi's election last year as federal president was the islands' first peaceful transition of power since independence. First settled by Arab seafarers 1,000 years ago and later a haven for pirates pillaging ships across the Indian Ocean, the rocky islands were annexed by France in 1904
