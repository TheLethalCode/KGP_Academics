 BAGHDAD, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's ambassador to Iraq said on Thursday he was willing to listen to the kidnappers of five Britons abducted in Baghdad last week but ruled out negotiating with them. "We have people here in Iraq who are ready to listen to any person about this incident, or any person who may be holding these men and who may wish to communicate," envoy Dominic Asquith said at a news conference. But, he added: "The British government's policy on these matters is clear and well known. We do not condone these actions." A British embassy official added: "The policy has not changed. We are still not willing to negotiate." The five Britons -- a computer consultant and his four bodyguards -- were snatched from a Finance Ministry data processing centre by gunmen wearing police commando uniforms. Iraqi government officials say they suspect Mehdi Army militiamen loyal to Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and believe the abduction may be in retaliation for the killing of a top militia leader in southern Iraq by British-backed Iraqi special forces. US and Iraqi soldiers hunting for the hostages have staged raids in Sadr City, the Baghdad stronghold of the Mehdi Army. British media have reported that British special forces are also on stand-by in Baghdad for any possible rescue bid. Norman Kember, the last Briton taken hostage in Iraq, was freed by Britain's elite Special Air Services in March 2006
