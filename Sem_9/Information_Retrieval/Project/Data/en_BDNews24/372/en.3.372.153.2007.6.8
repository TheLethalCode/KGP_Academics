<TITLE> Implenia sharpens takeover defence strategy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ZURICH, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Swiss construction group Implenia said it had sharpened its defences against a possible takeover by limiting British hedge fund Laxey Partners' voting rights after it called for a strategy change at the group. Laxey raised its stake in Implenia to 23 percent in April, a move Implenia described as a hostile act, but Implenia said Laxey would only have 4.9 percent of the voting rights and reiterated that it aimed to remain independent. "(The board of directors) is turning against the plans of the new major shareholders...to force Implenia to change its strategy and in this way to push through its own private interests," Implenia said in a statement on Friday. Implenia said the decision was based on a Swiss law known as Lex Koller, aimed at capping foreign presence in the Swiss construction market. "An important part of our business is the so-called Swiss real estate development business...That is roughly 20 percent to 25 percent of our EBIT," Implenia Chairman Anton Affentranger told Reuters on Friday. "Under Swiss law we have the famous Lex Koller, which forbids foreign controlled entities to get into the residential business. If we cannot prove that we are not foreign-controlled we cannot do that business anymore," Affentranger said. By 0812 GMT, shares in the group had fallen nearly 1 percent to 42.00 Swiss francs. Implenia stock has gained over 66 percent so far this year, boosted by takeover speculation. Laxey has said Implenia could be on the radar screen as a takeover target and described the group's plans to grow abroad alone as risky. Affentranger said the group was targeting specific projects abroad and that the group was already working with foreign companies. Affentranger said takeovers of service companies outside Switzerland were a possibility, but declined to say how much the group was prepared to spend on an acquisition. "It depends on the case. I do not think that at this stage we are in the mode where we put a number (out) ... overall the financial condition of the company is strong," he said. In a recent interview, Roger Buehler, investment head and supervisory board member of Laxey, was quoted as saying that the hedge fund had "encouraged a strategic review to assess which scenarios and ways of co-operations with another European construction group could exist". Swiss newspaper Cash reported on Thursday that Laxey had offered its Implenia stake to Austria's Strabag and Germany's HochTief. Hochtief said it was not involved, while Strabag and Laxey could not immediately be reached for comment. Last year, Laxey played a major role in the takeover of Swiss textile machinery maker Saurer by Oerlikon, selling its 24.1 percent stake to the Swiss conglomerate after pushing for a strategy review at Saurer. In 2006, Implenia had sales of 2.8 billion Swiss francs ($2.30 billion)
