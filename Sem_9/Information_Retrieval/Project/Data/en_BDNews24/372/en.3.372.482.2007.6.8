 LONDON, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British manufacturing output rose more than expected in April, taking the annual rate of expansion to its highest in three months, official data showed on Friday. The Office for National Statistics said manufacturing production rose 0.3 percent on the month in April after a 0.6 percent rise in March. Analysts had predicted a 0.2 percent gain. April's monthly rise took the annual rate to 1.3 percent from 0.7 percent in March, the strongest since January. "These figures are a little firmer than the market consensus and indicate second-quarter growth got off to a good start," said Philip Shaw, economist at Investec. "Manufacturing growth, however, still appears to be below what various surveys are implying." Factory output in the three months to April was 0.4 percent lower than in the previous three months, but the ONS predicted it would look in better shape next month, when weak February figures fall out of the comparison. It said the three-month decline was mainly the result of weaker aircraft production, but this was coming off high levels. Overall industrial output also rose slightly more than expected, by 0.3 percent instead of the 0.2 percent predicted by analysts. This left output 0.4 percent higher on the year, also the strongest in three months. Output in March was 0.4 percent lower on the year. The figures did little to alter expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates in the next few months, after it held them at 5.5 percent this week. Electricity, gas and water output fell 0.9 percent in April, the biggest decline since October. This was primarily the result of a steep fall in gas production as temperatures soared in April
