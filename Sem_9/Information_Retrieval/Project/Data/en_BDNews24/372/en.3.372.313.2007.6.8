 Naimul Haq bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent. Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com)  Lax monitoring and a lack of proper laboratory facilities have let substandard medicines capture a big portion of the retail pharmaceutical market. Some drug manufacturers are making quick money often in connivance with the health sector officials, a bdnews24.com investigation shows. Such medicinesfrom antibiotic and anti-cancer to pain relief drugsare posing a serious threat to the public health sector. Rural Bangladesh drug market is the target of a section of unscrupulous drugmakers since monitoring is virtually absent there. Retailers are encouraged to sell these substandard drugs, under uncommon brand names, in return for a fair commission. Village doctors, trusted by the locals for their spiritual as well as medical advice, play a big role as agents of the devious manufacturers. bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Naimul Haq has looked into that to unearth how and why such substandard drugs are increasingly dominating the pharmaceutical market. Poor laboratory facilities and lax monitoring by the Drug Administration (DA) are at the centre of the impending crisis. According to sources in the government and the pharmaceutical industry, each year 40 out of 200 registered pharmaceutical companies produce about 8,000 brands of medicines. This is equivalent to 80,000 to 100,000 medicines if the numbers of batches are taken into account. The National Drug Testing Laboratory (DTL), which operates under the Institute of Public Health (IPH), has the annual capacity to analyse around 2,500 samples of medicines of various brands. It means the DTL cannot test 70 percent of the samples for quality control a year. DTL chief Dr Abul Khair, however, contradicted. "We test about 90 percent of the samples we receive from various sources including the DA, the Criminal Investigation Department of Police, the combined military hospitals and mobile courts. Failure rates for quality testing are about 5-6 percent," Khair said. He said the techniques they follow to test the drugs are outdated. "In fact, we lack modern laboratory equipment and digital apparatus required for speedy and accurate test results. These are major barriers to conduct routine checking for quality control," he said. IPH director Dr Md Moyez Uddin also acknowledged that they face a string of limitations. "Even we have no generator. If power cuts happen we need to restart our test procedure," he said. Moyez said there is no separate allocation for the laboratory. "We need to follow a protracted procedure to get money for the laboratory," he said. "Still, there's no guarantee that we will get the fund, finally." The Drug Administration, which regulates the pharmaceuticals sector, is virtually a toothless tiger. Officials say the DA lacks adequate manpower and resources to keep its eyes on the burgeoning drug market. Drug Supers, who are assigned to collect samples randomly from drug stores, are not equipped with enough funds to buy, pack and send them to the testing laboratory, they say. One DA employee, who preferred not to be named, said they are helpless to check the spread of spurious drugs. "These drugs are life threatening, but we are helpless. Without proper logistics you can't do your job properly," the official said. He said several proposals to modernize the drug administration had been sent to the Ministry of Health but all efforts become fruitless. Meanwhile, drug makers are not ready to shoulder the blame. Nazmul Hassan, secretary general of Bangladesh Association for Pharmaceutical Industry, took a dig at the government for its failure in ensuring quality of the drugs. "It's the duty of the DA to look into the matter if there's any ill-practice. But its post marketing surveillance committee has failed to function," Hassan said. He said it is almost impossible to deal with the matter if there is no proper monitoring system in place. He said the DA has failed to utilise the equipment earlier purchased for the DTL with the fund from the World Bank. Dr Saidur Rahman of the Pharmacology Department of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University said the spurious drugs find their way to the rural Bangladesh just because of the failure from the government's end. "The DTL is not capable of analysing hundreds of types of drugs. Illicit drug makers are taking that chance to make quick money," he said. "Such drugmakers know that they won't be caught even if the spurious drugs are sent to the DTL for test." "One must know pharmacopoeia to test a drug. Without the knowledge of that chemists can't analyse any sample." bdnews24.com/
