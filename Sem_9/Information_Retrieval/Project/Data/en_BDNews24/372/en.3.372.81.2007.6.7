<TITLE> Slovenia to focus on Balkans in 2008 EU presidency </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LJUBLJANA, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Balkan countries hope to raise their profile with the European Union next January, when former Yugoslav republic Slovenia becomes the first ex-communist nation to take on the rotating EU presidency. Slovenia, which quit Yugoslavia in 1991 and is Europe's wealthiest post-communist state, says it will strive to forge closer ties between Brussels and the continent's most volatile corner, most of it still outside the 27-member bloc. "Our presidency has to be a success because we are the first ex-communist state to do it. If the first one fails, it will be a bad omen for the others," said a senior source close to the Ljubljana government, who asked not to be named. "At the same time, we must not get carried away, because if a country of 2 million people becomes too creative, what could you expect from Poland, with 40 million people, when they get the presidency?" the source said. Officials in the Western Balkans, a region still recovering from bitter ethnic conflicts in the 1990s, said they hoped to get the most out of Slovenia's January-June 2008 EU presidency. "We believe Slovenia will keep the EU's focus on this region and champion its interests," Bosnia's foreign ministry said in a statement to Reuters. "Slovenia has a special sensibility to recognize the needs of the Western Balkans". Slovenia plans to focus on the environment, energy issues and the bloc's eventual enlargement to embrace the Western Balkans during its presidency, the senior Slovenian source said. "We would like to push the obvious cases, if possible, Macedonia to start EU negotiations and Montenegro to get candidate status," the source said. Macedonia was made an official EU candidate in December 2005. Brussels has so far held back from setting a date for its membership talks, citing slow reforms and persistent tension with its ethnic Albanian minority after fighting in 2001. "We expect the negotiations to begin under the Slovenian presidency," Macedonian State Councillor for European Affairs Dragan Tile told Reuters. The tiny coastal state of Montenegro, which ended its union with Serbia last year, is also optimistic. "Montenegro has long planned to use the Slovenian presidency to advance towards EU membership," said former assistant minister for European integration Dragan Djuric. The Slovenian source said progress was less certain in Serbia, reluctant to see its Kosovo province moving towards independence, and Bosnia, whose talks with the European Union on associate membership have been shelved. "Serbia and Bosnia are still hot potatoes, potential bombs. A lot depends on the resolution of Kosovo's status and the direction of the new Serbian government," he said. Despite the difficulties, Ljubljana has not given up on Serbia, the dominant republic of the former Yugoslavia. "Eighty percent of the responsibility and opportunity is in your hands, and the rest is in ours," Jelko Kacin, a European Parliament envoy from Slovenia, said in Belgrade this week. "We can both try harder, but you should prove Serbia is ready and capable to do much more than it has done so far." Brussels is waiting for a report on whether Belgrade is cooperating fully in handing over fugitives to the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague before deciding whether to resume stalled talks on a Stability and Association Agreement
