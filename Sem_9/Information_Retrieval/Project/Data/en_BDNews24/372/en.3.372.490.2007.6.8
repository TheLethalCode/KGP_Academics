 MUMBAI, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian shares languished in the negative territory on Friday, caught in a global sell-off sparked by worries about rising interest rates, but losses were limited as a fall in rupee triggered buying in software services stocks. At 11:02 am, the benchmark BSE 30-share index was down 0.74 percent, or 104.84 points, at 14,081.34. The market also fell on Wednesday and Thursday. "Markets globally are falling on fears of rising interest rates ... we are also having an overhang of a rise in cash reserve ratio in the last couple of weeks," said Sejal Doshi, chief executive at local brokerage Finquest Securities. "So I think we will see a range-bound market for some time, and the move will mostly depend on the performance of the global markets." Shares in software services firms such as Satyam Computer and Wipro rose more than 1 percent after rupee fell to a three-week low. Index heavyweight Infosys gained 0.5 percent to 1,965.95 rupees. "If the market has to rise, IT sector would have to steer the growth as this is the only sector which has underperformed," Doshi said. "I think some value-buying would emerge after we get some clarity from the first-quarter results and guidance." The rupee hit a nine-year high of 40.28 per dollar last week, and its gains in 2007 have raised concerns that it would affect the profit of outsourcing companies, who earn most of their revenue in the United States. Leading state-run explorer Oil & Natural Gas Corp gained 1.4 percent after it announced five new finds of oil and gas at its blocks in the east coast and the north east of the country. In the broader market, 1,196 losers beat 791 gainers on volume of 67.2 million shares. The broader S&P CNX Nifty shed 0.75 percent to 4,148.85. On Wall Street major indexes posted their biggest three-day drop since a global rout in February, and their biggest one-day loss in three months on Thursday, as Treasury yields surged above 5 percent, and most Asian indexes were weaker on Friday. Elsewhere in the region, Karachi's 100-share index slid 0.07 percent to 13,228.29, while Colombo's All-Share index was down 0.15 percent at 2,545.87. STOCKS ON THE MOVE Shares of sugar makers including Balrampur Chini Mills Ltd., Bajaj Hindusthan, Sakthi Sugars Ltd. and Shree Renuka Sugars Ltd. were up 1.6-3 percent on reports the government is planning assistance for the sector. Educomp Solutions Ltd., after the software training firm said it signed an agreement to acquire Singapore-based Ask n Learn Inc. for S$7.03 million.
