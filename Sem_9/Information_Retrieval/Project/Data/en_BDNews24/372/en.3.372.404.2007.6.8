 LONDON, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares hit their lowest in about two months on Friday, mirroring slides in riskier assets on concerns over the impact of higher interest rates and inflation as goverment bond yields rose. By 1055 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 0.8 percent at 1,556.5, just near an intra-day low of 1,552.8, its weakest since April 19. Banks and miners accounted for nearly one third of the losses. Credit Suisse lost 2.4 percent and Barclays fell 1.6 percent. Anglo American and Rio Tinto both shed 2 percent. The index fell for the fifth day in a row, the longest losing streak since February and down 4 percent this week. The benchmark is however still up 5 percent so far this year. The rise in government bond yields has triggered a sell-off in global equity markets this week. "In this phase, I think it's just as bad as it can get because we have not had any major deterioration in underlying fundamentals," said Mark Bon, a fund manager at Canada Life. "There was a need for a correction, some consolidation for some of the speculative froth to be taken away. For a short time, it's probably more consolidation than a need to rush in immediately." Analysts said there were concerns that rising borrowing costs for private equity firms and companies might derail booming mergers and acquisitions which pushed European equities to 6-1/2 year highs just this month. "The more expensive it becomes to borrow money to do leveraged buyouts and M&A activity, the less of those deals will go through, but I dont think that hurdle has quite been reached yet," said Bon. "We haven't reached rates which are unattractive to do these deals." US stock futures indicated a weaker start on Wall Street. Ten-year euro zone government bond yields broke above 4.6 percent, their highest level in over 4-1/2 years, while benchmark 10-year US yields rose to 5.233 percent. This week has seen a combination of warnings on inflation from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, an interest-rate rise from the European Central Bank and silence from the Bank of England on its policy decision to keep rates unchanged. Across Europe, Germany's DAX index was 1.5 percent weaker, UK's FTSE 100 index fell 0.8 percent and France's CAC 40 shed 0.9 percent. The FTSEurofirst 300 index has fallen for five or more straight days just five times in the last three years. "The big excuse right now is interest rates," said Phillipe Gijsels, a senior equities strategist at Fortis Bank in Brussels. "We could have some more (equities) weakness but I don't think this is the end of the bull market, I think it is just a short correction," he said. Among standout gainers, BNP Paribas gained 1 percent after French newspaper Les Echos reported that Societe Generale was mulling a combination with its bigger domesic rival. SocGen shares were flat. Shares in French IT services group Atos Origin rose 1 percent on a report that larger rival Cap Gemini had hired bankers to investigate a possible bid for the company. CapGemini, whose shares fell 1.2 percent, declined comment but said it was watching developments in the sector
