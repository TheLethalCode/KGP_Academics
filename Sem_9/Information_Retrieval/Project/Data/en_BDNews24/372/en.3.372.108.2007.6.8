 COLOMBO, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka's Supreme Court on Friday ordered the government to stop evicting minority ethnic Tamils from the capital a day after police deported hundreds to the island's war-torn north, a civil rights lawyer said. Police on Thursday swept boarding houses in Colombo, evicted 376 Tamils citing security concerns and took them to the northern district of Vavuniya, now the front line of renewed civil war between the state and Tamil Tiger rebels. Rights groups are up in arms. The order came hours after police defused a big roadside bomb in Colombo and as local and international rights groups slammed the government for the deportations. "They have just made the order. The registrar has been asked to contact the Inspector General of Police immediately to stop any further evictions of Tamils from Colombo," lawyer M.A. Sumanthiran, acting for independent think-tank and advocacy group the Centre for Policy Alternatives, told Reuters. He said a second interim order had also been issued which stops police from obstructing Tamils from coming to Colombo. The Supreme Court registrar said the court was still sitting, and so he had no details of the orders. Many Tamils deemed by police to lack valid reasons to be in the capital spent the night in the grounds of a school building in the northern district of Vavuniya. The government now wants them to cross into rebel-held territory and return to their native villages at a time when the foes are fighting artillery duels. However the interim order only prevents further evictions, and it is unclear what would happen to those already deported from Colombo. Some observers likened the move to ethnic cleansing and dubbed it a disgrace to humanity, amid fears it could stoke ethnic tensions at a time when the civil war that has killed nearly 70,000 people since 1983 is deepening. "Nothing could be more inflammatory in Sri Lanka's polarised climate than identifying people by ethnicity and kicking them out of the capital," Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement issued from New York on Friday. "Tamil Tiger crimes don't give the government the right to engage in collective punishment," he added. "The Sri Lankan government is sending the dangerous message that it views most of its Tamil citizens as a threat to security." Aid agencies said the government had failed to lay on any food or water for the evicted families on their arrival. President Mahinda Rajapaksa's government insists the eviction was voluntary, which those ejected denied. Police said the move was a security measure following a series of attacks blamed on the rebels in and around the capital in recent months, and was also an effort to eject any potential Tiger infiltrators from Colombo. A Reuters witness in Vavuniya saw elderly women, mothers carrying children and young men getting off police buses, herded by police carrying T-56 assault rifles. Many carried a few salvaged possessions in plastic bags. "I had come back from abroad and was living in a lodge in Colombo. Then the police told me to get into the bus. They didn't tell me where it was going," said 32-year-old ethnic Tamil Kularatnam Prabhakaran after dismounting from a bus.
