<TITLE> Raising revenue-GDP ratio is an uphill battle: Azizul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 07 (bdnews24.com)  Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Thursday said the government faces an uphill task to raise the revenue-GDP ratio. The adviser lamented revenue collections were not increasing compared to GDP growth. "While the revenue-GDP ratio was 10.6 percent in FY 2005-06, it may slide down to 10.4 percent at the end of the outgoing fiscal year," Azizul said in his budget speech. "Raising the revenue-GDP ratio to 10.8 percent in the coming fiscal year will turn out to be a great challenge," he added. The revenue target for fiscal 2007-08 has been proposed at Tk 43,850 crore, an increase of 17 percent over that in the revised revenue target of the outgoing fiscal year. Of the proposed revenue target, Tk 10,838 crore would come from income tax, Tk 17,812 crore from import duty, Tk 14,800 crore from value added tax and Tk 400 crore from other taxes and duties. The finance adviser has also proposed an increase in income from non-tax revenue. In the past years, share of non-tax revenue had been around 18 percent of the total revenue receipts. The adviser emphasised boosting the revenue-GDP ratio, for which expansion of tax base, improvement of the quality of tax assessment, strengthening collection procedures, office automation, transparency and accountability of the tax administration and applied research were required. "We have to earn the confidence of the taxpayers through motivational efforts," he said. Azizul said tax policy would be separated from the tax administration to build a transparent and simplified tax regime. bdnew
