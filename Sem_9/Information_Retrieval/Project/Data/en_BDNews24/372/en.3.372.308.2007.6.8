<TITLE> Opposition to budget changes not too strong </TITLE>

 Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com) -- How the government raises fund to finance the budget has important implications for the performance of the economy and the welfare of various sections of the population. No budget is entirely neutral in its effects, hence the intense interest in the budget changes. Changes proposed to income tax will be received well by the ordinary taxpayers. The raising of the threshold to one and a half lakh taka will provide some relief, especially to low- and middle-income earners. The proposed provision for 10 percent tax rebate on incremental income in excess of 10 percent of last year's declared income is a clever move. It will reduce the disincentives to declare an increase in income and thereby raise tax revenue. The abolition of tax on credit card bill is commendable. It will encourage wider use of credit cards in commercial transactions, which will facilitate commerce and document transactions. Middle-class homeowners who are finding it difficult to meet mortgage expenses will be given some relief by the proposed deductibility of interest on housing loans of up to Tk 20 lakh. The proposed reduction of corporate profit tax from 45 percent to 35 percent for mobile phone companies who list on the stock exchanges will be greatly appreciated by the bourses. However, there is no good reason why this should be restricted to only the mobile phone companies. Proposed changes to the import duty structure are a mixed bag. While the withdrawal of 4 percent infrastructure development surcharge will be welcomed by all businesspeople, the same cannot be said about their changes in tariffs. The introduction of new duty slabs at 10 percent, 15 percent and 25 percent to replace the existing 5 percent, 12 percent and 25 percent is an unambiguous increase in the average tariff rate on these products. Merger of two slabs of supplementary duty at 15 percent and 25 percent into a single slab of 20 percent and reduction of 65 percent slab to 60 percent could reduce the average supplementary duty depending on the pattern of incidence of the slabs. A noteworthy aspect of the proposed changes is that low tariffs or duties have been raised while the higher tariffs or duties have been reduced or left unchanged. This will have the implication that the highly protected industries will have their protection lower while the modestly protected industries will be given greater protection. Those who have never been convinced about the merits of exemption of duties on capital goods especially computers, which are purchased by the most affluent people of the country, will welcome the withdrawal of zero-duty facility on a number of capital goods. The affected businesspeople will, of coarse, have a great deal to gripe about. The government has been certainly scooped by the unrelenting price hike of essentials. It has withdrawn custom duties on virtually all essential products, including edible oil, lentils, rice, wheat, onion, motor and chola dal. But intriguingly, baby milk food has not been given zero-duty facility. One would have thought that it should rate high for duty exemption. The budget proposes an increase in dealers' commission discount rate of used reconditioned cars from 25 percent to 30 percent on the ground that it will facilitate the availability of cars to the middle-class people. This is perhaps not a well-conceived measure. The cities and towns of the country, especially Dhaka, are already far too congested. Encouraging the usage of more vehicles without a concomitant plan of increasing road and parking space seems to fly in the face of common sense. On the revenue side, the adviser has tried hard to appear benign. A very large part of the budget, 29.4 percent (against 22.8 percent last year) will be financed by domestic and foreign borrowing. It will not impose any immediate burden on anyone, simply because it will shift the burden to future years and to future generations. Few will notice or understand the impact it will have in the immediate future through changes in the interest rates. The legal income tax burden has not been raised and the adviser has taken on board many suggestions of the researchers and civil society people such as zero or specific duty on essential items, higher threshold for income tax, home loan interest deductibility and withdrawal of tax benefits to undisclosed money. Proposed changes to import-related duties will not please every one, but the opposition to such changes is not likely to be serious or determined. bdn
