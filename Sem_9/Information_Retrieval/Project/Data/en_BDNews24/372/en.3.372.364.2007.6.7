<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 7 (bdnews24.com) -The ten-man Mohammedan Sporting Club held Muktijoddha Sangsad Krira Chakra to a 1-1 draw in the second- leg match of B. League at the Bangabandhu National Stadium Thursday. With the fourth draw in 12 matches, both Muktijoddha and Mohammedan joined league leaders Dhaka Abahani Limited each with 22 points . Abahani, however, played a match less than them. Both teams fought equally in the first half, but Mohammedan enjoyed a superior ball possession in the second half despite being reduced to 10 men in the 74th minute. Mohammedan had to play in the last 15 minutes without their Nigerian striker Emeka, who was sent off due to his second bookable offense in the match. Moroccan striker Brahim Buzziber gave the All-Red outfit a 13th-minute lead while Nigerian medio Divine Chibuike Ikechukwu restored the parity for the black and white outfit 19 minutes into the breather. Getting a free ball at the mid-field, Brahim ran down the middle without any interception by the opponents and took a powerful left-footer at the top of the box that kissed the Mukti's net in the 19th minute. After trailing by one goal in the first half, the Motijheel outfit reorganised itself to launch attack against Muktijoddha Sangsad and levelled the margin 19 minutes into the second half. Mohammedan Devine headed home from the close range when a free kick of Emeka outside the box came in his way hitting the Muktijoddha goalpost. "We were deprived of two certain penalty shots," claimed Mohammedan coach Shafiqul Islam Manik after the match. "The referee also cancelled one goal to deprive us of a certain win," complained Manik. Mohammedan striker Emeka doubled the margin four minutes before being sent off, but the goal was cancelled due to off-side. Muktijoddha coach Abu Yousuf also admitted that they could not take the advantage despite Mohammedan being reduced to 10 men. "We should have taken the advantage in the last 15 minutes of the game, but the boys were interested in bargaining with the referee rather than on the game," said Yousuf. "We also got a lot of chances, but the strikers squandared the sitters," said the former national player.
