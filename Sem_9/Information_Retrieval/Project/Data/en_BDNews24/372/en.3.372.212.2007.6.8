 Dhaka, June 7 (bndews24.com)  Senior BNP leader MK Anwar Thursday described the proposed budget for fiscal 2007-08 as positive, but hefty. Awami League presidium member Ataur Rahman Khan Kaiser termed it a big budget saying it had increased the prices of essentials but did not create job opportunities. The BNP and the Awami League have not given formal reactions to the full-year budget. However, some senior leaders of both parties expressed cautious reactions. In instant reactions to bdnews24.com, MK Anwar, BNP vice president and former agriculture minister, said the budget was development-oriented. "But it's bigger than the previous one and has lofty goals. The budget lacks guidelines for checking inflation." "As a result, the government has to borrow more from banks at the end of the year." The former minister described the government plan in the agriculture sector as positive. He said giving subsidy to the agriculture sector, especially irrigation, was positive and realistic. However, it did not have any measure to decrease production costs of agricultural goods, Anwar said. Anwar said that there were no specific steps in the budget to bring down the prices of essentials. He said only zero credit would not be able to control prices, real measures would be needed for this. He said the caretaker government should have given more attention to the power sector. He said the withdrawal of duty-free facilities from the industrial raw materials might have an adverse impact on industrialisation. Speaking to bdnews24.com, Ataur Rahman Khan Kaiser expressed cautious reactions. "It's a big budget. The government has to do a lot to implement it." Kaiser said the budget increased the prices of essentials but did not create any opportunity for employment. Liberal Democratic Party presidium member Anwarul Kabir Talukder told bdnews24.com: "If the budget could be properly implemented, it would bring welfare to the country." "The government has to do more to cut poverty and check the soaring prices of essentials." He stressed the need for giving more assistance to the agriculture sector and said: "If the prices of essentials have to go down, the farmers must be given assistance." bdnews24.com/sm/
