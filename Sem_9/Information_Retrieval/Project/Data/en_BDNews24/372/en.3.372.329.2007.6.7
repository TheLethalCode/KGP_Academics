 Dhaka, June 7 (bdnews24.com) -- The government has proposed a subsidy of Tk 750 crore for diesel used for irrigation purposes in the 2007-08 fiscal budget. Finance adviser AB Mirza Md Azizul Islam said: "Due to recent diesel price-hikes, the production cost of paddy per kilogram has increased by 50 paisa. The government is therefore committed to subsidising the extra cost that the farmers will have to bear because of the diesel price hike. Payment of this subsidy will only be made to cardholder farmers." "In the face of increasing population growth and shrinkage of agricultural land by one percent each year, we have no other choice but to increase agricultural productivity to meet the huge food demand and to contain inflation within tolerable limits," Islam said. He announced that the present government has given priority to agricultural research and has proposed an endowment allocation of Tk 350 crore for agricultural research and development in the current budget. bd
