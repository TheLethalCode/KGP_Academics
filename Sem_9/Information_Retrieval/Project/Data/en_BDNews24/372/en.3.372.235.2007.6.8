 NEW DELHI, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Uttar Pradesh government has been ordered to compensate children used as a "showpiece" at an official event after some of them fainted when forced to wait in the sun while the chief guest turned up hours late. The National Human Rights Commission asked the government of Uttar Pradesh to pay 49 children 5,000 rupees each in damages after they waited for six hours in the sun without food and shelter in October 2005. The children fell ill after sitting in the open at an event to mark the birthday of India's independence leader Mahatma Gandhi in Kanpur. "The National Human Rights Commission has strongly condemned the practice of using children as showpieces during VIP visits," the commission said in a statement late on Thursday. "Forcing the children to sit in scorching sun for six long hours is blatant violation of human rights," it said, accusing local authorities of having a "callous attitude". Authorities across India regularly use school children to greet guests at official ceremonies or form a prominent part of the gathering. But Indian newspapers frequently report how some children take ill after being forced to wait in the open for guests who are late or events that drag. The commission said local authorities "should treat children as valuable national assets and must handle them with care and affection.
