 BRUSSELS, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid are in talks with Chelsea to sign Dutch winger Arjen Robben, the Spanish club's president said on Thursday. "We are in talks with Chelsea and the player, they are at an early stage, but we hope to sign him," Real Madrid President Ramon Calderon told reporters at the European Parliament in Brussels. "Bringing Robben was one of my pledges when I was running for president and still remains the case," he added. The 23 year-old Robben was reported close to signing a new contract to keep him at Stamford Bridge until 2012 having turned down Bayern Munich, but Real are still hopeful of prising him away from London. bdnews24.com/aar/1741
