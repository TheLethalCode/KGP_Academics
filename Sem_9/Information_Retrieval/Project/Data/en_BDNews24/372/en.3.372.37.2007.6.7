 MADRID, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid striker Ruud van Nistelrooy is confident David Beckham will shake off an ankle strain and play in Saturday's key league match at Real Zaragoza. "David wants to play his last two games for Real Madrid and knowing his attitude I'm sure he will play," the Dutchman told a news conference on Thursday. This is Beckham's fourth and final season in Spain, and Real, yet to win a championship during his time there, stand top of the Primera Liga level on 72 points with Barcelona. "He has played a crucial part for us in the run-in to the end of the season and he wants to win the last two games so that he can fulfil his dream and leave the club with a trophy," added Van Nistelrooy. Beckham, who will join MLS side LA Galaxy at the end of the season, injured his left ankle during England's 3-0 win over Estonia in a Euro 2008 qualifier on Wednesday and was replaced by Kieron Dyer midway through the second half. Real issued a statement saying the 32-year-old midfielder had strained the internal lateral ligament in his ankle and medical staff would monitor the injury for the next 24-48 hours. With two games left, Real lead the standings because of their better head-to-head record against Barcelona. Sevilla are two points behind in third place. "This is the first time I've been involved in such a tight title race and it's fantastic," said former Manchester United striker Van Nistelrooy, who is the top scorer in the Primera Liga this season with 23 goals. "I think both Barcelona and Sevilla will win their last two games, so that means we have to win our two as well. I hope we play the way we have done in the past six or seven games." "I never expected to have a season as good as this, especially as I came to a new club and a new country, but it has been a great opportunity for me to start again.
