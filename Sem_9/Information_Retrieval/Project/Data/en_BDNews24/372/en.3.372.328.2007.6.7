 PRISTINA, Serbia, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An ethnic Albanian former guerrilla leader in Serbia's Presevo Valley called on Thursday for the region's unification with Kosovo, raising the stakes in a deepening diplomatic row over the province's fate. The Presevo Valley, adjacent to Kosovo and home to some 45,000 ethnic Albanians, is seen as a potential flashpoint if the province is denied independence by the United Nations. The West wants a U.N. resolution opening the door to independence now, but Russian support for Serbia has so far blocked its progress in the U.N. Security Council. Western powers leading a 16,500-strong NATO peace force in Kosovo fear delay could spark unrest among the province's 2 million Albanians, potentially reigniting Albanian insurgencies in the Presevo Valley and neighbouring Macedonia. Jonuz Musliu, the former political leader of a guerrilla army that fought Serb forces in 2000-01 in and around Presevo, told a Kosovo newspaper that little had changed to improve the plight of the region's Albanians since the conflict. He called for the creation of a 'National Council' "to begin negotiating with the Serbian government on the unification of the Bujanovac and Presevo municipalities with Kosovo." "Six years after the conflict in the Valley, nothing has changed politically or economically other than the creation of a multi-ethnic police force," Musliu, now leader of the Movement for Democratic Progress, told the Koha Ditore daily. The Presevo Valley and Macedonian insurgencies in 2000 and 2001 were widely seen as spillovers from the 1998-99 war in Kosovo, in which Serb forces killed 10,000 Albanians and drove out almost one million, in an indiscriminate bid to crush a separatist guerrilla army. Three months of NATO bombs ended the Kosovo conflict and the United Nations took control. Western diplomacy backed up by NATO subsequently put down the Presevo and Macedonia insurgencies with offers of greater rights, but tensions remain. The United States had forecast a Security Council vote on the Western-backed Kosovo resolution this week, but appears to have retreated in the face of a threatened Russian veto. The Group of Eight leading industrial nations was due to discuss the issue on Thursday at its summit in Germany, but diplomats saw little hope of a breakthrough
