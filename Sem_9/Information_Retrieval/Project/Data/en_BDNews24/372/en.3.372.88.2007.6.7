<TITLE> Crunch-time in knife-edge Spanish title race </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MADRID, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid could end a four-year trophy drought on Saturday by winning their crunch match at Real Zaragoza and if other results go their way in the penultimate round of the knife-edge Spanish title race. Real must beat a talented but unpredictable Zaragoza side and hope that Barcelona and Sevilla lose their matches against Espanyol and Real Mallorca if they are to be crowned champions. But club captain Raul believes the title race will go right down to the wire and will not be decided until the final match of the season on June 17. "We are in a privileged position, unthinkable a few months ago, but I don't think anything will be decided until the last game," Raul said. "I think all three sides will win their games, although we perhaps have the toughest one at Zaragoza." Zaragoza have developed into a bogey team for Real in recent seasons. They defeated them in extra-time in the 2004 King's Cup final, a result that is credited with precipitating the meltdown of the Galacticos, and last season they humiliated Real 6-1 in the semi-finals of the same competition. But Real are now a far more resolute outfit and a six-match winning run has strengthened their belief that they can end Barcelona's domestic dominance and take the championship. CITY RIVALS While Real have their sights trained on Zaragoza, Barcelona will need to beat city rivals Espanyol at the Nou Camp if they are to ensure they take the title race to the final game. But Frank Rijkaard's side will have to do without the inspirational Ronaldinho as they seek to tame their neighbours as the Brazilian was sent off after scoring the winner in their 1-0 victory over Getafe last time out. UEFA Cup finalists Espanyol put Barcelona to the sword 3-1 when the two sides met earlier in the season and would like nothing better than to spike their title ambitions with another victory. "Saturday's match if vital for us," said Barca midfielder Xavi. "And we know that even though there is practically nothing at stake for Espanyol they'll want to cap a great season by winning at the Nou Camp." Sevilla, who are two points behind the leaders and still in contention for the title, are away to Real Mallorca on Saturday. At the other end of the table Celta Vigo and Real Sociedad will be clinging on to their last hopes of survival in their respective clashes against Atletico Madrid and Racing Santander, though even if they win they could still drop out of the top flight
