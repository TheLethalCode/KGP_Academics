 LONDON, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Home Secretary John Reid will propose a series of tougher anti-terrorism laws on Thursday, expected to include extending beyond 28 days the time suspects can be held without charge. The proposals, which may also move towards allowing phone-taps to be used as evidence in court, could form part of a future counter-terrorism bill but are likely to face tough parliamentary scrutiny. Civil rights group Liberty said detaining suspects without charge for longer than 28 days was akin to internment. Prime Minister Tony Blair had to abandon an earlier bid to raise the detention period to 90 days after a Commons rebellion in 2005. Reid, adopting a more conciliatory approach than in the past, said that he would seek national consensus through a "staged process" of talks before introducing a bill. "I am hoping that that approach, which is slightly different from what we have done before, will maximise the degree of support we get, even where there are controversial areas," he told BBC TV. Newspaper reports at the weekend said the plans were supported by prime minister-in-waiting Gordon Brown. The reports said the plans would include: - Ending the ban on questioning by police after a terrorism suspect has been charged. This would be subject to judicial oversight to ensure that it were correctly and sparingly used. - Moving towards allowing phone-tap evidence to be admissible in court. A security source told Reuters that MI5 would not oppose such a move but said it would place burdens on an already stretched intelligence agency. - Making terrorism an aggravating factor in sentencing, handing judges greater powers. - Increasing the security budget, which has already doubled to more than 2 billion pounds a year since the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States. Last week the Home Office said it was looking at giving police broad powers to stop and question people as part of new counter-terrorism legislation. Liberal Democrats Home Affairs spokesman Nick Clegg said there was still no evidence from police or government ministers to justify extending the period of detention without charge beyond 28 days. He told BBC Radio the need was diminished by the proposal to allow police questioning after a suspect has been charged. The government faces opposition from within its party and the House of Lords. Britain is virtually alone in the Western world in not allowing the use of telephone intercepts as evidence in court. However, "eavesdropping" information -- gained by the police or security services from bugging suspects' homes or cars -- is admissible in trials. Such material played an important part in convicting five Britons in a major terrorism trial in April. The security services recorded them discussing possible attacks on the Bluewater shopping centre near London and the Ministry of Sound nightclub
