 LONDON, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The head of Channel 4 defended the decision to broadcast a contestant using a racially offensive word on Big Brother, saying he regretted the incident but felt the public should see for themselves. Student Emily Parr, 19, was removed from the Big Brother house on Thursday after she was heard to say: "Are you pushing it out, you nigger?" to black contestant Charley Uchea, 21. The exchange was not shown live at the time but later featured on the show's highlights programme, provoking accusations that the channel was exploiting the publicity to boost ratings. "I think it was entirely right to show it. I think it was important to do that," Channel 4's chief executive Andy Duncan told BBC radio. "We had to let people see the whole context of what was said, and why it was said and how it was said. "We regret what happened ... but I also think it was dealt with very appropriately, swiftly and decisively and it demonstrated that we had learned that some of the improvements we had put in place are working." Duncan said it showed the channel had learned from criticism by TV regulator Ofcom of the handling of a racist row earlier this year on the celebrity version of Big Brother. That show was overshadowed by the racial abuse of eventual winner, Indian actress Shilpa Shetty, by other housemates and Ofcom ordered the broadcaster to issue an apology before the current, eighth series of the popular reality show started. Critics disagreed with Duncan over the latest row. "They don't seem to have learned anything and they don't seem to be prepared to take steps to make sure this doesn't happen again," said David Turtle, from Mediawatch-UK, a group that campaigns for better standards on TV. He condemned the decision to air a clip including the offending comment and Channel 4's explanation. "That was an outrageous step," he told Reuters. "You can't explain context in any way for a racist comment I'm afraid. That's just bizarre to even make an argument in that case." Parr said she was sorry for the remark which she did not mean to be offensive, adding she had been just joking. Uchea, who listed racism as one her dislikes on her Big Brother profile, said she had not taken it personally but was shocked at the language used. Angela Jain, who heads Channel 4's Big Brother commissioning team, said viewers would agree that the comments were careless rather than malicious but producers had taken action following the earlier controversy. "In the wake of Celebrity Big Brother, we must consider the potential offence to viewers, regardless of Emily's intentions and her housemates' response," she said. The Commission for Racial Equality has welcomed Channel 4's swift action. "Whichever way you look at it, the 'N' word is clearly offensive," it said in a statement. Parr had been up for eviction from the house after being chosen to be one of two housemates who would have to face a public vote. The planned eviction has now been cancelled
