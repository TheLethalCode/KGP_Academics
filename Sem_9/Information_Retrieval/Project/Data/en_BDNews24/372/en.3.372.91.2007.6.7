 Dhaka, June 7 (bdnews24.com) -- The government Thursday proposed Tk 5,479 crore for the health sector in the budget for fiscal 2007-08, up by 10.31 percent from Tk 4,967 crore in the previous fiscal year. Of the Tk 26,964 crore total development budget, the health sector alone has been allocated 9.7 per cent. In his budget speech, finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam proposed increased participation of the private sector for an improved hospital management system that would enhance the quality of healthcare services. He also said that it had already been decided to contract out non-government organisations to manage and provide healthcare services in areas like population control, prevention of malnutrition and contagious diseases. He said that areas in which the private sector was more efficient would be contracted out on management contract basis. To increase quality nursing, the government would set up more nursing institutions in the public sector, he added. He said that efforts had already been made to mobilise the support of hospitals, universities, and other institutions operating in the private sector. A programme on development of health infrastructure was already underway and institutional based project implementation had been strengthened to extend the facilities of specialized healthcare services, he went on to add. He also proposed re-fixing of advance tax deduction at source by hospitals and diagnostic centres at the rate of 10 percent, instead of the existing 5 percent, from the payments made to the doctors like in the case of other professionals. bd
