<TEXT>
 PARIS, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Eager to bury memories of her worst showing in a grand slam semi-final, Maria Sharapova turned her thoughts to her love affair with Wimbledon. The Russian, playing in her ninth major semis, managed to hold serve just twice during her 6-2 6-1 humiliation by Ana Ivanovic at the French Open on Thursday. Sharapova was already dusting the red clay off her shoes as she looked forward to walking back through the gates of the All England Club. "I'm excited.

So I'm very looking forward to it," said the second seed, who lost her chance to reclaim the top ranking from Justine Henin following Thursday's defeat. "I love being part of Wimbledon. I can't even say how happy I am when this time of year comes around. "I'm always thinking from the beginning of the year, 'I hope I'm always healthy when Wimbledon comes around because it's a very special place in my career, in my heart'. "I always love going back there." Despite the pummelling she received from Ivanovic, the U.S. Open champion was quick to point out that her trip had not been a complete waste since she had made it to the last four in Paris for the first time. "I think this was a very positive two weeks for me, considering I was out for so long," said the 20-year-old, who needed a cortisone injection to play in the tournament after being sidelined for several weeks with a shoulder injury. "My shoulder's held up pretty good. This has been great preparation, so I guess it can only be a positive." Analysing her semi-final display, she added: "When I had my chances, I just made sloppy errors. "I started off slow and once you start slow... the train's already in London. It's gone.
