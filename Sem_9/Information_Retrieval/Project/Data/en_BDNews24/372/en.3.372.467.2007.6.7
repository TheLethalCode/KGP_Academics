 DURBAN, South Africa, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - All-rounder Jacques Kallis will lead a new-look South African squad on a short tour to Ireland this month. Kallis will stand in as captain for Graeme Smith, who is recovering from a knee operation and will miss the tour. All-rounder Shaun Pollock, who is currently playing in the Afro-Asia Cup in India, was not considered, a Cricket South Africa statement said on Thursday. South Africa will play one match against Ireland and three against India in the Belfast tournament. Selection convenor Haroon Lorgat said South Africa wanted to use the event to experiment with their player options. "Following the World Cup and the timing of this tour it is an ideal time to develop new talent as we prepare for the future," Lorgat said. The squad includes two uncapped players in all-rounder Vernon Philander and off-spinner Thandi Tshabalala, who toured Sri Lanka last year but did not play. Relatively inexperienced international players including batsman JP Duminy, fast bowler Dale Steyn and wicketkeeper Morne van Wyk have also been selected. "The potential and performances of these players were carefully monitored in the past by the selection panel and now is the right time to introduce them into the national squad," Lorgat added. The tournament starts on June 23 and ends on July 1. Squad: Jacques Kallis (captain), Mark Boucher, AB de Villiers, JP Duminy, Herschelle Gibbs, Andrew Hall, Justin Kemp, Charl Langeveldt, Andre Nel, Makhaya Ntini, Vernon Philander, Dale Steyn, Thandi Tshabalala, Morne van Wyk
