<TITLE> Kazakh leader grips power ever more tightly </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ALMATY, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Nursultan Nazarbayev has styled himself a firm but modern Khan in his 17 years in power in Kazakhstan, but critics say his authoritarian rule brooks no opposition and borders on a personality cult. Showing a firm resolve to stay in control, the 66-year-old former steelworker signed constitutional amendments on May 22 that allow him to stay in office for life. His opponents, some at home, some in exile, accuse him of usurping power, backtracking on democracy and appointing allies and family members to key positions. But the leader of this major oil-producing nation on the Caspian Sea has insisted that Kazakhstan has its own vision of development, which differs from that of the West. "We should not ... run after every foreign recommendation," Nazarbayev said at the end of last year. "We should not blindly copy foreign schemes." The stocky ex-Politburo member, serious and unsmiling in public, holds vast powers in the former Soviet country, an important new source of energy for Europe as it seeks to diversify routes away from Russia. Key decisions, from oil contracts to foreign policy, all go through his office. Media rarely criticise him. Rising prosperity has made the president popular in the nation of 15 million, but the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe criticised as flawed his 2005 re-election. Nazarbayev won a Soviet-style 91 percent of the vote. His move to allow himself to rule for life led analysts to draw parallels with other regional leaders such as late Turkmen President-for-life Saparmurat Niyazov who dotted the nation with golden statues of himself during his iron-fisted 21-year rule. But although Nazarbayev's sayings and portraits adorn the walls of many official buildings, he is still a long shot from more authoritarian regional leaders and has used oil revenues to improve living standards and modernise the country. Descended from nomadic Turkic-speaking Kazakhs who have roamed the steppe since the days of Genghis Khan, Nazarbayev has achieved what many ex-Communist leaders in ex-Soviet republics could not: stability and relative prosperity. "Scientists have proved that true democracies don't live long if their per capita GDP (gross domestic product) is lower than $3,000," Nazarbayev said in May. Kazakhstan's per capita GDP was just over $5,000 in 2006. Born in 1940, Nazarbayev became a steelworker and rose through the ranks of the Communist Party, becoming a politburo member in 1990 just before the Soviet Union collapsed and narrowly missing a chance to become the last Soviet premier. Recognising that huge mineral wealth could also be a political tool, Nazarbayev brought in companies from China and Russia, as well as the United States and Europe. But the incoming petrodollars have been the source of scandal. US prosecutors have charged his former consultant, James Giffen, with corrupt practices and say Nazarbayev accepted over $60 million in bribes from oil firms. Both deny the charges. After independence, Nazarbayev won kudos in the West by voluntarily giving up the country's nuclear arsenal and appointing reformers who created a strong financial system. In power, he has consolidated his hold and brooked no opposition in the same way as could be expected from any Khan -- a traditional title for rulers in the region. Reminding others in the ruling elite to know their place, Nazarbayev stripped his once-influential son-in-law Rakhat Aliyev of his power last month after the two fell out. Ten years ago, he moved the capital from the mountainous south to Astana, a former Soviet town on a windswept steppe in northern Kazakhstan. Nazarbayev poured billions of dollars into its imposing, if slightly surreal glass-and-steel government buildings. Yet his personal side remains largely closed to public view. Fielding questions sent by email on Thursday in an internet conference, he revealed little and ducked a question about his salary, saying he was worth more than his pay. He said he liked reading literature, philosophy and political works, enjoyed playing tennis and golf and had never sent a text message on a mobile phone, but would give it a go. During the visit of US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in 2005, one reporter asked whether he was a dictator. Nazarbayev simply replied: "Judge for yourself"
