 LOS ANGELES, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - David Beckham's exhilarating form since his England recall has put a smile on the face of Los Angeles Galaxy club president Alexi Lalas. Although the 32-year-old midfielder is likely to miss several Galaxy matches because of international commitments after he joins the Major League Soccer (MLS) side next month, Lalas says that is "part-and-parcel" of the modern game. "It's not only an honour for him but also an honour for the Galaxy that we can say one of our players is performing so well for a team like England," Lalas told Reuters on Thursday. "If his form continues and David is called up in the future, I will drive him to the airport myself." Beckham, who will join the Galaxy from Spanish giants Real Madrid on a five-year deal worth $250 million, was recalled to the England squad last week after being discarded following last year's World Cup. He made a promising comeback in Friday's 1-1 friendly draw with Brazil at Wembley and set up two goals to steer England to a 3-0 Euro 2008 qualifying win over Estonia on Wednesday. Firmly back in favour with coach Steve McClaren, Beckham is almost certain to play in England's friendly against Germany at Wembley on Aug. 22 and also in their last five qualifying games for Euro 2008. NATIONAL CALL-UPS "We adhere to FIFA rules and regulations if any of our players are called up by their national teams and that applies to David too," Lalas said. "Any kind of competitive or business challenge that call-ups in the middle of our season would pose is stuff that we'll deal with. "Overseas travel is part-and-parcel of the modern game and certainly it is difficult. But I have done it and many other players have done it. You get used to it." One of the most marketable sports figures in the world, Beckham is scheduled to link up with the Galaxy in mid-July after taking a short holiday with his family following the end of this European season. "These players aren't robots, they are human beings," Lalas said. "From a Galaxy perspective, it's imperative that our players have an opportunity to rest and recuperate. "Having gone through a very long, difficult and, hopefully, an ultimately successful season, David will need to take a break. "We feel that once our team is all together, we will be one of the strongest in the league. It's been a difficult time for us with injuries and call-ups but the reality is at the Galaxy we have high expectations of what we can achieve.
