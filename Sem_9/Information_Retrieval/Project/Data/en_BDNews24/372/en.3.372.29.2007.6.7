 MANCHESTER, England, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - West Indies fought back after lunch with four wickets to reduce England to 167 for five at tea on the first day of the third test at Old Trafford on Thursday.

He perished when failing to keep his hook shot down and was caught on the square leg boundary by Dwayne Bravo off Collymore's bowling for nine. England then lost Cook without another run added as they slumped to 132 for four. This time, debutant seamer Darren Sammy had Cook caught low down in the gully by Bravo for 60 off a square cut.

Paul Collingwood was lbw to Jerome Taylor for 10 shortly before tea. Ian Bell, who took 15 balls to get off the mark, was unbeaten on 16 at tea and Matt Prior had one
