 LONDON, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Stock markets shuddered in the shadow of rising borrowing costs and fears of inflation on Friday as a more than five year bond-buying spree looked to be at an end. European and Asian shares fell, following losses on Wall Street overnight, while bond yields rose again. The dollar firmed as popular currency "carry trades" were seen to be in danger of buckling. The yield on benchmark US Treasuries was up another 4 basis points to 5.18 percent after the biggest one day rise in more than three years on Thursday. Worries that central banks around the world will need to raise interest rates more than previously expected to combat inflation have battered bond markets this week. "There is something of a re-pricing of risks going on globally," said Nomura rate strategist Charles Diebel. "As we witnessed yesterday, the move to higher yields poses a threat to the equity markets as well and, when taken in the broadest context, is a natural extension of the removal of liquidity globally." European shares fell for a fifth day in a row. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 0.3 percent. It has lost about 4 percent this week, the largest weekly fall since the short-lived correction in early March. In other European markets, London's FTSE 100 index fell 0.2 percent, while Frankfurt's DAX shed 0.6 percent and Paris' CAC 40 lost around 0.1 percent. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei lost 1.52 percent or 274.29 points to 17,779.09 and the broader TOPIX index lost 1.32 percent to 1,756.16. One exception to the rule was China, where the Shanghai Composite Index added 0.57 percent after a blizzard of positive commentary about stocks in state-owned media was seen as more evidence that the authorities did not want a further sharp drop in the market. Chinese stocks losses have been a concern among global investors. The rising yields on bond markets appeared to mark the end of a five-year bull run in fixed income that has bucked the trend of tightening monetary policy in what former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan dubbed a "conundrum". As well as Treasuries, the yield on euro zone government debt was up, gaining 2.6 basis points to 4.57 percent. "The magnitude of the cumulative move of the past three days (before Friday) has not been seen for 21 months," Calyon said in a note. Currency markets were volatile with the yen -- the funding currency for many popular carry trades in which investors borrow cheaply and invest for higher yield -- rebounding. The dollar extended gains to 2-month highs versus the euro and sterling. The euro had hit $1.3383, its lowest since April 10. Sterling hit a 2-month low of $1.9668. The euro hit a one-month low of 161.77 yen
