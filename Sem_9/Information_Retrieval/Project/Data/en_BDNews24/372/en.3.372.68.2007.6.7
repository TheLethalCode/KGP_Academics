 Prof MA Taslim Dhaka, June 7 (bdnews24.com) -- The budget is not overly ambitious. It sensibly acknowledges the constraints of the difficult time that the nation is passing through. Finance adviser Mirza Azizul Islam has laboured not to dash the high expectations raised by the rhetoric of poverty alleviation and good governance. This could not have been an easy task with declining domestic revenues and shrinking foreign grants and concessionary loans. The end result was the largest deficit budget in recent history. The deficit will soar from a moderate 3.7 per cent last fiscal year to a projected 5.6 per cent during this year. This very considerable increase derives largely from the inclusion in government liabilities of Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation debts, which stand at a staggering Tk 7,523 crore. This was inevitable although the former Finance Minister had avoided the responsibility to make his budget balance look pretty. The accumulated loss of BPC, ultimately a government entity in whatever name it is categorised, will have to be borne by the government unless it wants to wreck the financial health of the government-owned commercial banks who loaned out the money to BPC at government insistence. The overall deficit of Tk 25,581 crore will be financed by both foreign and domestic borrowings. The adviser expects disbursement of foreign loans to increase over FY2006-07 by 21 per cent, which will cover about 25 per cent of the overall deficit. The rest will be financed by domestic borrowing. Borrowing from domestic banks will increase to Tk 7,253 crore, an increase of 11 per cent over borrowing last year, which incidentally was higher than the budgeted amount by over 20 per cent. The BPC liabilities will be liquidated by issuing treasury bonds. This will not of course have any immediate implication for the fiscal balance as the adviser correctly pointed out, but only because it will shift the liabilities to a future date when the bonds will have to be redeemed. Meanwhile the government will add to the interest liabilities, which will climb to 19 per cent of domestic revenue. The rapidly increasing interest payments that now uses up the entire income and profit tax revenues need to be curbed to avoid a future deficit blow-out. On the expenditure side, non-development expenditure will use up more than 60 per cent of the total spending. Spending on the Annual Development Programme will be restricted to only Tk 26,500 crore or about the same as in FY2006-07. Given that only 83 per cent of last year's ADP was actually implemented, the modest size of the next year's ADP would seem appropriate. This budget does not promise to usher the economy to a high growth regime. However, if its implementation is not as poor as that of last year's, it will be able to repair part of the damage done to the economy in the recent past. This will be no mean achievement. bdn
