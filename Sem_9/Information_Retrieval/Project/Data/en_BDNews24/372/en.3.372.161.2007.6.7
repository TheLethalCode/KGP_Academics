 LONDON, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South African Ray Mali was named as acting president of the International Cricket Council (ICC) on Thursday following the death of Percy Sonn last month. Mali, president of Cricket South Africa since 2003, will take on the role for about 13 months until the ICC's 2008 annual conference, the world governing body said in a statement. Mali takes over from compatriot Sonn, who died on May 27 at the age of 57 following a colon operation. "I take this assignment as an honour and a big challenge," said 70-year-old Mali, who has stepped down as CSA president. "I feel lucky to be taking over at a time when the game is in such good shape. It is also a privilege to succeed Percy, somebody who was a good friend and a person who worked so hard for the betterment of this great game," he added in a statement. ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed welcomed Mali's appointment, saying he was a worthy successor to Sonn. "Ray is an experienced and skilled administrator, a man of calm assurance and someone who combines a deep love of the game with an understanding of how best to secure its well-being.
