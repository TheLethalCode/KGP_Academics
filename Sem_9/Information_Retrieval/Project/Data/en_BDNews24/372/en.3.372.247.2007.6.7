 LONDON, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US stock futures rose on Thursday, suggesting investors may use this week's sell-off to buy back into equities even with bond yields at nine-month highs as worries mount over rising interest rates. June Dow Jones futures rose 0.36 percent, while S&P June futures rose 0.42 percent and Nasdaq 100 futures gained 0.31 percent. On Wednesday quarterly data showing a rise in unit labor costs triggered further selling on Wall Street as investor concern grew over a pick-up in inflation and slowing growth, reflected in a sharp rise in government bond yields. "Yields going higher is not good because businesses will then have to pay more for the money they borrow and that will take away from their bottom line," said Jeffries International senior vice president Steve Previs. "Bond yields are heading up which means people are uncomfortable with the level of inflation," he said. Benchmark 10-year US Treasury yields broke above 5 percent, hitting their highest level since August and were set for their fifth successive weekly increase -- the longest stretch of weekly rises in nearly two years. On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average slid 129.79 points, or 0.95 percent, to end at 13,465.67 points, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 13.57 points, or 0.89 percent, to 1,517.38, posting its biggest two-day drop since March. The Nasdaq Composite Index shed 24.05 points, or 0.92 percent, to close at 2,587.18. But the rise in the stock futures suggested the market may pare some of these losses later in the session. "Two days of hard sell-off and there was no follow-through in Asia overnight ... even though the market was down 129 points last night, it didn't stay at the low, it bounced going into the close," Previs said, adding: "we didn't have that sharp sell-off later in the day to instill the panic." In corporate news, Alcan Inc on Wednesday rejected Alcoa Inc's $28.3-billion hostile bid, but did not shed any light on its strategy to counter the takeover offer from the world's number one aluminum producer. Alcoa shares shed 2.4 percent to 28.80 euros in Frankfurt, making them the biggest decliners among the larger companies that trade in European hours. Thursday's earnings diary included quarterly results from US microchip manufacturer National Semiconductor Corp. Economic data include weekly initial jobless claims, but investors will also be able to scour the monthly same-store sales figures from some of the world's biggest retailers, including Wal-Mart, Target and Costco, for evidence of any softness in consumer spending
