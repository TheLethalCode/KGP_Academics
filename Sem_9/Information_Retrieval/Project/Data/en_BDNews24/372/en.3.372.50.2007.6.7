 HAMBURG, Germany, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany coach Joachim Loew can look back on a near perfect debut season in charge after a 2-1 win over Slovakia gave his side a five-point cushion in Euro 2008 qualifying Group D. Loew stepped up to replace Juergen Klinsmann after Germany finished third at last year's World Cup and the German Football's Association to promote the former assistant has been vindicated after six wins and a draw from seven qualifiers. "We're unbeaten in qualifying for Euro 2008," Loew said at a news conference after the Slovakia win. "Not many teams have done that post-World Cup." The highlights have been away wins over the Czech Republic, who are five points behind Germany in second place, and Slovakia, who are down in fourth. They have also beaten San Marino home and away by an aggregate 19-0, and third-placed Ireland at home, with the only slight disappointment being an away draw with Cyprus. Wednesday's home win over Slovakia came despite the absence of captain Michael Ballack and other established players like Bastian Schweinsteiger and Lukas Podolski, who were all out injured. Victory was sealed by a goal from Thomas Hitzlsperger, who is one of a number of players to break into the first team since the World Cup. Loew believes the progress of such players under his guidance has been the highlight of his first year in charge. "It's a real success for us that we've managed to bring on so many young players after the World Cup," Loew said. "Players like Marcell Jansen, Hitzlsperger and Mario Gomez have taken big steps forward and we can be proud of that. "Our goal for the new season will be to make improvements on an individual basis. Of course there is work to do on our tactics as well but improving individually is now the target.
