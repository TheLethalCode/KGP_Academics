<TITLE> Namibia delays US millionaire extradition case </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WINDHOEK, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Namibian court on Friday postponed until June 25 an extradition case involving a fugitive US millionaire wanted in the United States on charges of stock manipulation. The Namibian magistrate's court approved a defence request for the delay after lawyers said they had not been informed early enough of the appointment of a new magistrate in the case, Petrus Unengu. US prosecutors are seeking the return of Jacob "Kobi" Alexander, the former chief executive and founder of New York-based software maker Comverse Technology Inc, on criminal charges of manipulating stock options. Alexander has been fighting extradition to the United States since shortly after his arrest in Namibia in September. Alexander and two other former executives at the New York-based voicemail-software maker are accused of backdating millions of stock options to days when the shares were trading at lower prices, allowing executives to reap substantial gains, according to details of his US indictment. In August, Alexander was charged with 32 criminal counts ranging from alleged conspiracy to securities fraud and money laundering and could face up to 25 years in prison if convicted
