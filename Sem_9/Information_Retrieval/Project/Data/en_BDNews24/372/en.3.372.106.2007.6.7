<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 7 (bdnews24.com)  Keeping the bowling varieties of Sri Lanka in mind, the Tigers are preparing for both fast and turning wickets before leaving here for the Emerald Island nation for three-match Tests series and as many one-day games. "Top-ranked teams struggle in Sri Lanka and there is no doubt that Bangladesh tour of Sri Lanka would not be easy," said selector Athar Ali. Athar watched the Tigers' first-day training along with newly-appointed selector Akram Khan at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur Thursday. "We are a bit worried about the batsmen who are not getting runs in Test matches and the main focus would be on the batsmen during the training session," said Khan. "We have asked curators to prepare two types of wickets, fast and turning pitches, so that the batsmen can avoid problems when they face a variety of Sri Lankan of bowlers." "Sri Lanka have a variety of bowling attack with Chaminda Vaas, Lasith Malinga and Muttiah Muralitharan who can turn the ball on any kind of wicket. "So we want the players to go to Sri Lanka fully prepared," said the former Bangladesh captain, who had a look at the players in training for the first time after becoming a selector on June 1. "We have a lot of confidence in bowlers and fielders of doing well, but the batsmen have to stay long in the middle to give a healthy total for the bowlers to fight," said Khan, who led Bangladesh to clinch the ICC Trophy that opened the World Cup door. Bangladesh leave for Sri Lanka on June 17. "It would be hard for the players to play on the bouncy wicket and they have been asked to practise on such wicket to make them familiar," Khan said. Khan was happy with the one-day team and sees no problem with the way they have been performing. "The one-day team has improved a lot and their defeat margin against the giants is gradually coming down. Overall, they push hard any side in the world." New captain Mohammad Ashraful, opener Tamim Iqbal and left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak, who returned home Wednesday playing the Twenty20 match in India, joined the Tigers in the gym session after skipping the fitness training and fielding session in morning due to tiredness. Promising middle-order batsman Saqib Al Hasan also did not join the training as he remained busy with a relative's wedding. Vice-captain Mashrafee Bin Mortaza and ace spinner Mohammad Rafique are in India to play the Afro-Asian Cup series. Assistant coach Sarwar Iman supervised the players on the first-day as interim coach Shaun Williams, scheduled to return Friday night from Australia, would join the boys Saturday. Imran emphasised the importance of improving individual performance. "The batsman would spend most of their time in the nets during the camp," said Imran. He said they are looking forward to performing better in Sri Lanka than they did in the home series against India. "We are trying to make our sides stronger instead of looking for Sri Lanka's strong points," said Imran, who coached Bangladesh in their inaugural Test against India. "If the boys can perform to their potential, then it is not impossible to see a draw or a win against Sri Lanka," the tall coach said. bdn
