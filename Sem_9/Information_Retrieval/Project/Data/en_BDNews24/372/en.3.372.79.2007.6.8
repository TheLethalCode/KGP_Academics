 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com) The Power Development Board is "going slow" in installing new power lines and expanding its clientele in the wake of precarious power crunch countrywide. By March 2008, power production may rise by a maximum 100-200 MW, said a PDB official preferring to remain unnamed for job security. The official said the caretaker government at the outset of its tenure orally instructed the PDB to be restrictive in offering new connections. Such instructions were necessary because the 1910 Power Act makes it mandatory for the power suppliers to oblige any taxpayer formally requesting a new connection, he said. Expansion of power distribution networks also has been halted since. The PDB earlier would give a new connection within 10 days of receiving formal application, which now takes about a month, the official said. The government made the move to see off the summer when power demand reaches its peak, he said. The PBD puts the daily power shortfall at over 1000 MW. The official said another 600 MW would be added to the capacity in the next two months. But at the same time, five 554 MW units will have to be shut down for repair and maintenance. Khijir Khan, the PDB chairman, told bdnews24.com the power plants are now producing 3500-3600 MW electricity while 25 percent plants are being maintained. International convention has it that a third of a country's plants may be kept steady at the most, he said. bdnews24.c
