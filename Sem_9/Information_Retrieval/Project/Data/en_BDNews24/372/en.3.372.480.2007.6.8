 BUENOS AIRES, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Boca Juniors beat Colombia's Cucuta 3-0 on Thursday to book a place in the final of the Libertadores Cup, where their opponents will be Brazil's Gremio. Midfielder Juan Roman Riquelme was the key player, unlocking the Cucuta defence with his probing passing and scoring the vital first goal to set up the 4-3 aggregate win. The start of the semi-final clash was delayed by 45 minutes as thick fog swirled around the Bombonera stadium, and poor visibility threatened to interrupt play again even as the game proceeded. Cucuta were playing without Blas Perez, scorer of two goals in his club's 3-1 first-leg win, as the rangy striker was on international duty for Panama. Boca's midfield dominance began to tell and Cucuta goalkeeper Robinson Zapata made a string of impressive saves before succumbing to an exquisite Riquelme free-kick on the stroke of half-time. Boca striker Martin Palermo used his strength to nod home Boca's second goal from a corner, and midfielder Sebastian Battagalia scored the decisive third goal on 83 minutes. Cucuta were striving to reach the Libertadores final at the club's first attempt, whereas Boca are aiming for a sixth title. Gremio have twice won South America's most prestigious club tournament
