 Dhaka, June 7 (bdnews24.com) - Adviser CS Karim said Thursday information technology has brought a huge change to the view about the world. Earlier newspaper reports were fresh to readers, he said, but now the electronic media reaches news to the houses of people within minutes of an incident. The adviser made the comments while addressing as chief guest a seminar at the East West University auditorium. bdnews24.com and The Structural Engineers Ltd (SEL) co-organised the seminar. The adviser said students are now able to get information easily and answer objective questions by only ticking the right answer. But during his student days, Karim said, teachers would teach the whole book and students would have to give narrative answers. The reason for the change from the old system to the new is the easy availability of more information and easy selection. For easy availability of information technology, Karim said he would work with the Atomic Energy Commission. "There, at the end of the sixties, large-size but low-capacity computers were brought in creating quite a stir. "Now the computer has become easily available and the internet has added unbelievable speed to transmission of information. "As a continuation of the process in Bangladesh news media like bdnews24.com have now come into being. People had earlier only heard about the existence of such news media abroad," the adviser said. Ashit Roy Chowdhury, a teacher in the English Department of the East West University, said once it was thought the electronic media would drive the print media away, but that that did not happen. The two media are not opposed to each other, but are rather complementary, he said. One is helping the growth of the other, he added. Khaled Muhiuddin, a news editor at the online newspaper, said bdnews24.com combines speed and accuracy in reaching news to a varied group of readers both at home and abroad. REHAB president and managing director of SEL Engineer Abdul Awal said the students of this generation would have to prepare themselves for providing leadership in future. He urged all to study with the aim of becoming good human beings. bdnews24.com director of operations Nizam Mohammed Uddin said bdnews24.com had received huge response at home and abroad in a short span of time. Different local and foreign news media are subscribing to bdnews24.com. Cellular phone companies are also subscribing to provide their customers up-to-date news snaps, he added. Sub-editor Fahmida Wadud Chaity described her experience of working for an online newspaper. "I'm proud of being a member of the bdnews24.com family," she told a packed audience of students. The seminar was followed by concerts by two band groups. More than 100 students attended the seminar and enjoyed the concert. bdnews24.
