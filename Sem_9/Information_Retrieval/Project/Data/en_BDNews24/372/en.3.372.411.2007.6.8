 Dhaka, June 08 (bdnews24.com) - Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Friday termed the proposed national budget transparent, accountable and definitely not ambitious. The adviser said that poverty reduction and human development constituted the prime focus of the proposed budget. Azizul made the statement during a post-budget press conference at the NEC auditorium in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar. The government Thursday announced a Tk 87,137 crore national budget for fiscal 2007-08, including Tk 7,523 crore in liabilities of the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation. Revenue target has been set at Tk 57,301 crore and the annual development programme outlay, Tk 26,500 crore. "We've included government's contingent liabilities in the budget for the first time in Bangladesh's history," Islam said. "The budgetary expenditure has been estimated on the basis of the resources. Estimated 10.8 percent revenue target compared to the GDP is quite achievable. We'll get the estimated foreign assistance (2% of GDP) if we can ensure good governance," the adviser said. On the much-talked-about price control of essentials, the adviser said that they had taken three-dimensional measures -- tax reduction, improvement of supply chain and agricultural production -- to contain prices of essentials. But he added: It is not possible to fully contain prices in today's world. Social safety net had been widened so that the price hike could not affect poor people. Some Tk 1,556 crore has also been allocated for import of food grains to reduce the gap between demand and production, the adviser noted. Replying to a query, the adviser said that the proposed import duty enhancement to 10 percent from 5 percent for raw materials and capital machinery was being wrongly analysed. "Duty will be more or less the same for withdrawal of 4 percent surcharge. There was no pressure from donors in this regard," he said. The adviser told the media that measures had been taken to mobilise resources from internal sources. Tax system has been proposed to be simple, he said, adding: "Introduction of universal self-assessment system on tax has also been proposed in the budget to bring transparency." Discretionary power of the tax officials has also been restricted, he said. On the impact of the record budget deficit of 5.6 percent, and the consequent bank borrowing, on inflation, the adviser said it would hardly affect inflation. The deficit is 3.7 percent for the outgoing fiscal. About the private sector credit growth, Azizul said that it was 17 percent so far in fiscal 2006-07. "None can call the situation bad," he added. Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed: "If the manufacturing and services sectors maintain their growth momentum, projected 7 percent GDP growth for the next fiscal is attainable." The only risk was with agricultural production, particularly with the crops, he added. For better use of subsidies, the adviser said that a card system for farmers would be introduced. Replying to a query, he said that the government had no exact statistics on unemployment. To another question, he said that hawkers, evicted by the present government, would be rehabilitated. "District administration has been ordered to take care of them," said finance secretary Dr Mohammad Tareq. Referring to budget criticism by different quarters, the adviser said that one should take into consideration the overall state of the economy before making any comment. bd
