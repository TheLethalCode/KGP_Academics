<TITLE> Mirza Azizul marks Tk 1,100 crore in export subsidy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 7 (bdnews24.com)  Finance adviser Mirza Azizul Islam Thursday proposed Tk 1,100 crore in export subsidies for fiscal 2007-08. But he sounded a note of caution: "We should bear in mind that subsidies for an indefinite period encourage inefficiency." He said the subsidies compel the efficient sector to shoulder the burden of additional tax and "dissipate the resources which could be otherwise channelled to important sectors of the economy". "Subsidy cannot continue for ever in any sector. Therefore, there is no alternative to enhancing efficiency to stay in competition in the international arena," Azizul said in his budget speech. To make the private sector more dynamic and competitive, steps have been taken to continue the tariff advantage for the import of most capital machinery, he also said. "Overall tariff rates have been scaled down. Stock related laws are being amended."
