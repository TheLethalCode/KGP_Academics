 Dhaka, Jun 7 (bdnews24.com) - Economists and industrialists Thursday termed the government move to raise import duty on raw materials and intermediate goods self-defeating and said it would hit the local industries hard. "We will have to face tough competition. The dynamism the local industrial sector created these days will be tougher to maintain," Mir Nasir Hossain, president of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry, told bdnews24.com. Nasir made the comment after finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Md Azizul Islam proposed to impose a 10 percent duty on raw materials and 15 percent duty on the import of intermediate goods in his rather ambitious Tk 87,137 crore proposed budget for the 2007-08 fiscal year Thursday. The adviser proposed to introduce duty slabs at 10 percent, 15 percent and 25 percent instead of the existing 5 percent, 12 percent and 25 percent. He also proposed complete withdrawal of four percent infrastructure development surcharge. The adviser, however, proposed to maintain 25 percent duty on imported finished goods. Nasir also lamented proposals to withdraw zero duty in the import of capital machinery. "Our competitors have advantages of raw materials, capital machinery. But we compete with them by importing these items," he said. "We urge the government to reconsider the proposed duty structure as it will hit our competitive edge," Nasir said. Zaid Bakht, senior researcher of Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies who greeted the government for taking measures such as subsidy to agriculture and the move to narrow down income discrimination and price control, also pointed to the danger of imposing duty on raw materials. "This is totally self-defeating. The country's growing industrial sector will be hit hard," he said. He, however, said that successful implementation of the budget might be difficult. "It is impossible to implement such a budget given the low number of advisers and the same implementation bureaucracy," he said. He also pointed to the poor revenue generation performance and declining trend in foreign financing. The government had never earlier achieved its revenue generation target. "The revenue collection will suffer if the economy fails to regain pace," he said, referring to the sluggishness of the economy due to government's anticorruption drives. Bakht referred to a steady decline in foreign financing in the last couple of months, and asked,"How does the government forecast getting a double foreign funding for the next fiscal?" bdnew
