 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Mumbai, June 8 (bdnews24.com) - AKTEL has selected SAP enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution to increase its operational efficiency, the company's executives said at a news briefing Thursday. "AKTEL's finance, accounting, human resources, technical, sales, supply chain and other divisions are now manifolds efficient and productive with the ERP solutions of SAP," said the company's accounts manager Masudur Rahman. He used an analogy to explain ERP. Cars are fitted with speedometer, fuel gauge, milometer and other indicators instantaneously displaying the vehicle's various statuses. It helps the drivers to take decisions before, during and even after the journey. "Similarly, a fast growing organisation like ours has to be constantly aware of every department's position to function in a synchronised manner and that's what the ERP solution delivers," Rahman said. Supply chain manager Mizanur Rahman said AKTEL must withstand the customers' growth and network resources are to be mobilized in advance to maintain the quality of service. Ordering equipment, preparing inventory, sending them to sites, activating them followed by routine maintenance is a chain of daunting tasks. "If there is a missing link in this extremely complex process, we are out of business in the fiercely competitive market." Mizanur Rahman said the ERP solution of SAP ensures the stability of the supply chain. "Earlier it took nearly thirty minutes to generate a purchase order but now it takes a few seconds." He said the entire process is flawless and tamperproof as a robust computer controls it centrally. AKTEL has deployed two such servers in different locations to ensure that one takes over in case the other computer fails. The company's assistant general manager of human resources, Shabbir Ali, is quite excited: "Now we can track every employee's output and assess them accordingly." He said it perfects the evaluation process of the company's human capital. AKTEL has paid $440,000 licence fee to SAP and procured ten ERP modules. They will be used by 400 executives of the country's second largest mobile phone provider in terms of clientele. AKTEL's costing and budget manager Sabbir Ahmed said his company is already getting tangible returns of this investment. Efficiency of his colleagues has already increased 99 percent. "ERP is a combination of workhorse and watchdog as it ensures that everybody delivers without making any mistake." But Ahmed said the top management of a company has to register the value of ERP and get equally committed. The AKTEL executives have recognised ERP an effective tool for transparency and good governance. The efficient private sector cannot deliver alone unless the public offices also become at par using modern technology, they said. Citing the Indian examples the AKTEL officials hope the finance ministry of Bangladesh will also adopt ERP solutions to streamline the revenue collection and strengthen fiscal management. bdnews
