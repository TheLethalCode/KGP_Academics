 MADRID, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid have signed a deal to make Austrian on-line betting firm Bwin their chief sponsors, the Primera Liga leaders said on Friday. Their current sponsors BenQ Mobile filed for bankruptcy in January forcing the nine-times European champions to hunt for new backers. Bwin, who sponsor AC Milan, had been in negotiation with Real's arch-rivals Barcelona before the defending league champions agreed a link with UNICEF. Real and Bwin will provide further details of the deal, which Spanish media reported to be worth between 15 and 20 million euros, at an official presentation on Monday
