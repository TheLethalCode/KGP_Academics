 Dhaka, June 7 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association Thursday hailed the interim government for extending bonding period to 24 months from the current 15 months in the budget. "Extension of bonding period was a long standing demand of the garment manufacturers," BGMEA president Anwar-Ul-Alam Chowdhury (Parvez) told bdnews24.com in an instant reaction. Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam proposed Thursday in the budget to extend bonding period to two years from the existing 15 months to encourage exports of the export-oriented industries. "The measure has been taken to protect the local industries," the adviser said in his budget speech. However, Chowdhury said the withdrawal of zero-duty facility on textile machinery would hamper the growth potentials of the industry. He said proposal of minimum import duty slab at 10 percent from 5 percent might have hurt the industry. bdnew
