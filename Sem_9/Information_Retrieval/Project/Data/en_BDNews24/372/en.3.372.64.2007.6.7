 Dhaka, Jun 7 (bdnews24.com) -- Prices of essentials, such as edible oils and lentils, are expected to go down as the government has proposed withdrawal of import duties on these items to curb inflationary pressure on the economy. Finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam in the budget speech for FY2007-08 proposed complete withdrawal of customs duty on these items to keep market prices tolerable. Islam, who expressed concern over inflation, blamed price hikes in the global market. He said, "Supply and price of most of the import-oriented essential commodities have soared in the global market resulting in hike in prices domestically." "However, we are continuing our sincere endeavour to halt the trend," he said. He also proposed continuation of duty-free benefit for essential commodities such as rice, wheat, onion, matar dal and chola dal. Islam also referred to the concern on possible aggravation in price situation arising from the recent increase of diesel price by 21 percent and said that the affect would not be much. The government, however, was set to allocate a total of Tk 750 crore as subsidy to reduce the sufferings of farmers because of the diesel price hike. The adviser proposed distribution of the funds through cards. Islam expected the average inflation to hover at around 7 percent up to June 2007. "It will settle down to 6.5 percent in the next fiscal year," he said. The adviser also asked the government to impose 25 percent customs dutyfrom the present 12 percent, on formalin and stearic acid import to prevent public health hazards. In the 2006-07 fiscal year, the import duty on rice, pulses, onion, garlic, turmeric, chilly and ginger was brought down to 5 percent. To keep the sugar market stable, it had also withdrawn import duty on finished sugar and imposed a Tk 5,000 specific duty against import of each metric ton of sugar. bd
