 SINGAPORE, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Shares and bonds fell on Thursday as the prospect of rising interest rates around the world sparked fears that a rally in global markets may run out of steam, although several stock indexes staged late recoveries. Chinese shares, whose recent wild swings have tested risk appetite, headed up, helping restore investor confidence and cushioning a fall in Hong Kong's main index. South Korean and Japanese shares held on to positive territory and Britain's FTSE 100, which nursed a steep fall on Wednesday, was seen opening firmer. Investors there have interest rates on their minds ahead of a Bank of England interest rate verdict later. Financial bookmakers in London expect the FTSE to open around 8-11 points higher, and see Germany's Dax and France's Cac-40 posting slimmer opening gains. An interest rate hike by the European Central Bank on Wednesday and New Zealand's move earlier on Thursday to lift rates, which sent its currency to a 22-year high, dampened sentiment by underscoring a trend of rising borrowing costs globally. With investors already fretting over rates, US data released overnight showing higher-than-expected labour costs, fuelled worries about inflation. These concerns weighed on the dollar, which traded at 121.306 yen at 0609 GMT. The euro also eased to $1.3509, unsettled by a lack of guidance on the outlook for eurozone rates from ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet. "But the risks of a change in the scenario of global economies doing well are quite low, and so even if we see a short-term correction, people are still going to flock to higher-yielding currencies," said Kikuko Takeda, currency analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. Japan's Nikkei staged a late recovery to end 0.1 percent higher, with machinery companies like Komatsu rising ahead of machinery orders data on Friday. But concerns that the Bank of Japan would join the queue to raise rates unsettled Japanese government bonds. June 10-year futures dropped 0.19 point to 132.28, while the 10-year JGB yield hit a 10-month high, rising 2.5 basis points to 1.860 percent. US Treasuries also fell as the China share recovery kept investors interested in riskier assets. South Korea's KOSPI escaped the selling to gain 0.6 percent. Seoul shares hit an eighth record close in a row after a volatile session after data pointed to an improving domestic economy. But other stock markets in Asia fell, including Hong Kong's Hang Seng, which dropped 0.6 percent. By 0622 GMT, MSCI's broadest index of shares elsewhere in Asia was up 0.2 percent as regional markets cut earlier losses. Despite a generally weaker tone to stock markets, some analysts remained positive about the outlook for Asia. "In regards to the domestic markets, the pace of gains may slow, but everything else remains the same: Fundamentals are strong and there's a lot of money coming in," said Kim Joon-kie at SK Securities. Oil prices rose above $71 a barrel after news Turkish troops conducted operations in northern Iraq rekindled concerns over Middle East tensions. Prices were also buoyed by a US government report showing the nation's refineries struggling to boost fuel production at the start of the peak demand summer vacation season, and disruptions in oil and gas exports from Oman after a cyclone in the Arabian Sea shut loading operations. London Brent crude was up 16 cents at $71.18 a barrel, adding to gains in New York overnight. Spot gold ticked up to around $672 an ounce
