 Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com)  The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka Friday approved three more days for the police to interrogate former state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar in an arms case. The same court ordered Bengal Group chairman Abdul Khair Litu into jail. Metropolitan magistrate Jagannath Das Khokon issued the orders. Sub-inspector Kabir Ahmed of Gulshan Police Station appealed to court for a fresh five-day remand to interrogate Babar at the end of his four-day remand in the same case. Baba'r lawyer Hossain Ali Khan opposed the remand appeal. Joint forces arrested Babar on May 28 and Litu on June 3. Babar had earlier been questioned for four days in the first spell of remand. Litu was also on a three-day remand before the court sent him to jail in an appeal by Gulshan police sub-inspector Mainul Islam. According to police reports, Litu regularly paid politicians and influential people kickback expecting advantages in his business deals. Litu is also charged with patronising criminals alongside committing crimes. He conceded that he owns huge wealth earned by unfair means, police said. The court ordered the jail authorities to provide Litu with proper treatment after Litu's lawyer prayed for division and treatment in jail. Litu's wife told court that her husband has been suffering from brain hemorrhage and diabetes. bd
