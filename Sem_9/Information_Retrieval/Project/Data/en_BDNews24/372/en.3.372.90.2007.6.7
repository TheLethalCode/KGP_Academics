 LONDON, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zambia has commitments of $4.2 billion in foreign direct investment over the next three years, compared with total FDI of $3 billion in the last three, Zambia's trade and commerce minister said on Thursday. Zambia would consider privatisation of its utilities but does not want to rush into a state asset sale, trade and commerce minister Felix Mutati told Reuters on the sidelines of an investors' forum here. "We are expecting about $4.2 billion in committed investments over the next three years, half of that will be in the mining sector," Mutati said. Mutati said the total included $900 million previously announced from China for an economic zone in Zambia's mineral-rich copper belt. Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa this week challenged the West to match Chinese investment in Zambia, saying Western countries had let his country down. Mutati said any privatisation of Zambian utility companies such as telephone providers would have to involve local investors. "We are looking and learning from the lessons in the first phase (of privatisations) of the first 10 years. I think we could have done some of the privatisations better, we could have earned a bit more money for Zambia, we could have created more opportunities for locals." Zambia said in April it would increase the price for the stake in state-owned Zambia National Commercial Bank (Zanaco) it is selling to Dutch bank Rabobank. The government has come under fire from trade union groups and some opposition parties for agreeing to sell a 49 percent stake in Zanaco to Rabobank for $8.3 million. Mutati also said he was not concerned about the strengthening of the national currency, the kwacha , which is currently trading around the year's highs. "The currency has stabilised around 4,000 to the dollar," he said. The kwacha has strengthened this year but is still below highs reached in May 2006, when world copper prices hit a record peak. The currency hit a multi-year peak of 2,975 per dollar at that time. Separately, presidential economic adviser Situmbeko Musokotwane told Reuters that Zambia was talking to rating agency Standard & Poor's about getting a credit rating, but had no immediate plans to issue an international bond. "We can borrow, as long as it is debt-sustainable. We have a preference for grants, and then for concessionary loans." Zambia has only $0.5 billion in outstanding debt after the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and western creditors wrote off a large part of its debt last year. The country is not rated by major agencies Moody's, Fitch or S&
