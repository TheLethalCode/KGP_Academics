 INTERLAKEN, Switzerland, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European championship organisers said they were well ahead of schedule as celebrations got underway on Thursday to mark the one-year countdown to the start of the tournament. "We are very much ahead of previous tournaments at the same stage," said Martin Kallen, Chief Operating Officer of Euro 2008 which is being organised jointly by Switzerland and Austria. "I would say we are about 90 percent done with the planning and 65 percent done with the implementation," he said. "But if we don't work hard on the details in the coming months then a lot of things could still go wrong," Kallen told Reuters before a gala dinner to commemorate the countdown in the Swiss resort of Interlaken. As if to emphasise the clockwork-like organisation behind the tournament, six of the eight host cities unveiled giant timepieces on Thursday, each counting down to next year's kickoff. Further festivities are planned on Friday when two teams of former and current international players are due to stage a 10-minute friendly match on a glacier beneath the summit of the 3,454-metre Jungfrau mountain. Following a number of teething problems with stadiums in Zurich and Klagenfurt, that had originally threatened to derail the entire project, organisers say much of the Euro 2008 infrastructure is now in place. Four of the eight stadiums are already complete or in need of only minor modifications, while the remaining four - in Zurich, Innsbruck, Salzburg and Klagenfurt - are due to be finished by September. Euro 2008 is due to kick off in Basel's St Jakob-Park stadium on June 7. The final will be held in Vienna on June 29
