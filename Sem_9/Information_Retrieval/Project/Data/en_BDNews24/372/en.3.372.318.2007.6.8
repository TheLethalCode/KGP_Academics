 ROME, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President George W Bush will skip a visit on Saturday to Rome's historic Trastevere neighbourhood for security reasons, a spokesman for the religious group he was to have visited there said on Friday. Bush will instead meet members of the Sant' Egidio Roman Catholic community, which has been nominated several times for the Nobel peace prize, elsewhere in the Italian capital, probably at the US embassy. Asked if the change had been made because of security concerns, Sant' Egidio spokesman Mario Marazziti said: "Yes, clearly." The Trastevere neighbourhood where the group has its headquarters is one of Rome's oldest quarters, made up of narrow cobble-stoned alleys difficult for a presidential motorcade to negotiate. Italian security officials had been nervous about a Bush visit to the neighbourhood although they decided earlier this week that it would go ahead. Rome authorities had planned to effectively shut down the entire neighbourhood while Bush was there. Marazziti said US security officials had visited the area on Thursday. They informed the community on Friday that Bush would not be able to meet them at their headquarters, but instead at the US embassy or the ambassador's residence. White House spokesman Tony Fratto said the change in the venue of the meeting was decided "for logistical reasons". He said it would take place at the U.S. embassy instead. Bush was to have stopped at the world headquarters of the group at about 1030 GMT on Saturday after his meeting with Pope Benedict at the Vatican, which is close by on the same side of the Tiber River
