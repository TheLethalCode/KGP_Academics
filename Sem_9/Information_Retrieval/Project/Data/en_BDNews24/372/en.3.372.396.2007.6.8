<TITLE> Bush ill with stomach bug at G8: White House </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 HEILIGENDAMM, Germany, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President George W Bush fell ill on the final day of a Group of Eight summit with a stomach ailment but his condition is not serious, a White House official said on Friday. Bush hoped to return to summit meetings later in the day, White House counselor Dan Bartlett told reporters. "Not sure if it's a stomach virus yet or something like that, but (he's) just not feeling well in the stomach, and guess he didn't want to follow in the footsteps of his father in Asia," Bartlett said. In January 1992, President George Bush, the father of the current US leader, vomited and collapsed during a state dinner at Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's residence. Bush hoped to return to summit meetings later in the day and kept a scheduled bilateral meeting with French President Nicolas Sarkozy, but in his private quarters. "Despite the fact the president is feeling very much under the weather, they were able to conduct a very substantive meeting," Bartlett said. The new French leader confirmed Bush was not in top form. "I have just come out of a meeting with president Bush who is slightly unwell," Sarkozy told reporters. "He will join the working session when he can." Bush is due to travel from Germany to neighbouring Poland later on Friday and there were no changes to the schedule at this point, Bartlett said
