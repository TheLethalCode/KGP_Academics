<TEXT>
 LONDON, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks rose in early trade on Thursday, boosted by renewed M&A speculation as markets shrugged off interest rate worries and snapped a three-day losing streak. Vodafone rallied 3 percent after an activist investment group called on the company to free up as much as 38 billion pounds from its assets to return to shareholders. By 0715 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 0.5 percent at 1,594.1 after falling 1.6 percent in the previous session when it closed at its lowest since May 17. It fell as much as 2.6 percent this week but is still up 7 percent so far this year. "There's a strong base effect due to oil prices and probably inflation rates will start to diminish in the second half of this year," said Thierry Lacraz, a strategist at Pictet & Cie. The Bank of England's interest rate decision at 1100 GMT tops investors' agendas, a day after the European Central Bank raised rates to 4.0 percent and showed its readiness to hike again. Benchmark 10-year US Treasury yields briefly pierced above 5 percent for the first time since mid-August
