 Dhaka, June 7 (bdnews24.com)  The economy clocked a 13 percentage points lower growth rate at 6.50 percent in fiscal 2007 compared to 6.63 percent annual growth in the previous year due to a reduction in agricultural output. The economy is projected to grow at 7.0 percent for fiscal 2007-08, said finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam in his budget speech. "Propelled by higher growth in industrial and service sectors, albeit with sluggish growth in agriculture, the overall economic growth in FY 2006-07 has been estimated at 6.5 percent," he said. Azizul blamed price hikes in international markets for inflation. He said supply and prices of most import-oriented essential commodities soared in the international market, which meant the government could not put a rein on domestic price rises despite its best efforts. "However, we are continuing our sincere endeavour to contain the trend," he said. He also referred to the countrywide concerns over a recent increase by 21 percent in the prices of diesel, saying it would not affect the public in terms of further inflation. "The weight of sectors affected by diesel in our commodity basket, including transportation, is low," he said. The finance adviser expected the average inflation to hover around 7 percent up to June 2007. "It will settle down to 6.5 percent in the next fiscal year," he said. bdnews
