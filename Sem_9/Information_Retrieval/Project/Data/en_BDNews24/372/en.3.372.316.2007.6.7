 Dhaka, Jun 7 (bdnews24.com)  Finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Md Azizul Islam Thursday announced incentives for mobile phone companies to come to the capital market. Cell phone operators will keep facing higher corporate tax unless they go public, according to a proposed budget for fiscal 2007-08. Mirza Azizul proposed to keep a 45 percent corporate tax on those cell phone operators who remain out of the capital market. "But the tax would be 35 percent for companies who convert to publicly traded companies and enlist with the stock exchange," Islam said. Islam also said the government would offload shares of a number of state-owned enterprises in the capital market. In the next fiscal year, shares of the state-run power, telecommunication and energy sectors will be off-loaded in order to expand the capital market, he said. The adviser had earlier initiated the move to offload shares of profitable state-run ventures during his chairmanship of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The government in mid-2005 decided to offload the shares of about 20 SoEs through the capital market. Two state-run power companies  DESCO and Power Grid Company of Bangladesh offloaded a portion of their shares to the market. Islam said following the listing of SoEs in the stock exchange, the supply of securities in the capital market has increased and opportunity for investment in the capital market has become wider. Islam referred to the recent surge in transactions in the capital market and said the market is gradually being widened and deepened. "The remarkable increase of market capitalisation as well as daily turnover is attracting foreign and local investors," he said. bd
