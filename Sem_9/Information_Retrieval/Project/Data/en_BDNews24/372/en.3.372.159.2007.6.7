<TITLE> Gas war rages in Sicilian baroque valley </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ROME, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Residents of a Sicilian valley famed for its baroque churches and palazzi are up in arms over plans by a Franco-American oil and gas company to drill wells. Andrea Camilleri, Italy's most successful living writer and a born-and-bred Sicilian, wrote a full-page article in daily La Repubblica on Thursday calling for the project to be halted to avoid "violating and destroying our small, splendid paradise". The eight cities and towns in the Noto valley are considered jewels of baroque architecture. The area was mostly flattened by an earthquake in 1693 and rebuilt in the ornate style of the time. It was added to UNESCO's World Heritage list in 2002. La Repubblica started a petition online on Thursday, alongside similar initiatives by residents, to "save baroque from oil", even though the company at the centre of the dispute says it is looking for gas, not crude deposits. More than 17,000 people signed the petition by mid-day. "It would completely destroy, in one stroke, landscape and history, culture and identity, beauty and harmony -- in one word the best we have," Camilleri said in his plea, which prompted two Sicilian politicians to vow to block the drilling. A spokesman for Panther Eureka, an oil and gas exploration firm which is 70 percent owned by Texas-based Panther Resources Corporation with the remaining 30 percent controlled by France's Maurel & Prom, played down the protests. Panther's Giuseppe Salme said the drilling sites would be "in the countryside" and nowhere near the Noto Valley's towns and famous archaeological areas. "We've done everything by the book and we are expecting to win the authorisation within days. We are 100 percent confident," he said, adding that an estimated 50 billion cubic metres of natural gas could be hidden in the grounds. The controversy first erupted in 2004 when local authorities gave Panther a licence to look for hydrocarbons in an area in south-eastern Sicily. But a year later, faced with a revolt, the region's governor suspended the permit. Since then, Panther has won an appeal with an administrative court but its drillings are on hold as it awaits the final go-ahead by local authorities. Panther says other Italian companies, including oil and gas giant ENI, have long drilled in the area, arguing it is the victim of discriminati
