 COLOMBO, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lankan police defused a big roadside bomb in Colombo on Friday as local and international rights groups slammed the government for rounding up minority ethnic Tamils and deporting them to the war-ravaged north. The military said a 7-kg Claymore mine was found planted by a main road near a police barracks in a residential quarter of the capital, a day after police swept boarding houses in Colombo and evicted 376 Tamils citing security concerns. Many deemed by police to lack valid reasons to be in the capital spent the night in the grounds of a school building in the northern district of Vavuniya, now the front line of renewed civil war between the state and Tamil Tiger rebels. The government now wants them to cross into rebel-held territory and return to their native villages at a time when the foes are fighting artillery duels. Some observers likened the move to ethnic cleansing and dubbed it a disgrace to humanity. "Nothing could be more inflammatory in Sri Lanka's polarised climate than identifying people by ethnicity and kicking them out of the capital," Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement issued from New York on Friday. "Tamil Tiger crimes don't give the government the right to engage in collective punishment," he added. "The Sri Lankan government is sending the dangerous message that it views most of its Tamil citizens as a threat to security." Aid agencies said the government had failed to lay on any food or water for the evicted families on their arrival. President Mahinda Rajapaksa's government insists the eviction was voluntary, which those ejected denied. Police said the move was a security measure following a series of attacks blamed on the rebels in and around the capital in recent months, and was also an effort to eject any potential Tiger infiltrators from Colombo. A Reuters witness in Vavuniya saw elderly women, mothers carrying children and young men getting off police buses, herded by police carrying T-56 assault rifles. Many carried a few salvaged possessions in plastic bags. "I had come back from abroad and was living in a lodge in Colombo. Then the police told me to get into the bus. They didn't tell me where it was going," said 32-year-old ethnic Tamil Kularatnam Prabhakaran after dismounting from a bus. But Prabhakaran, whose name is similar to that of the Tigers' feared leader, is from the army-held northern Jaffna peninsula, which is cut off from the rest of Sri Lanka behind heavily guarded defence lines. He cannot reach home even if he tries. "They told me to go to Jaffna," he said. "I told them I can't go back because I can't live in Jaffna. Now if we can't live in Colombo, where can we live?" Aid groups said it was unclear when the deported Tamils would move from the school in Vavuniya, but the Tigers have said they would allow them to cross into their territory. Sri Lankan civil rights groups sent an open letter to President Mahinda Rajapaksa on Thursday calling for a halt to the deportation of Tamils from the capital, amid fears it could stoke ethnic tensions at a time when the civil war that has killed nearly 70,000 people since 1983 is deepening
