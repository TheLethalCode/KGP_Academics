 Dhaka, June 07 (bdnews24.com)  Dr AB Mirza Azizul Islam has unveiled a Tk 87,137 crore national budget, including Tk 7,523 crore liabilities of Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation -- an increase of 30.37 percent from the revised figures for the outgoing fiscal year. The revenue target is Tk 57,301 crore, a 16 per cent increase from the revised one. The National Board of Revenue (NBR) will raise Tk 43,850 crore; Tk 1,988 from non-NBR sources and Tk 11,463 crore from non-tax revenue. The budget will have a deficit of nearly Tk 30,000 crore, up by nearly Tk 12,500 crore. The deficit would be 4.2 percent of the GDP, which was 3.7 percent in the outgoing fiscal. The government last week announced that development spending for 2007-08 will be Tk 26,500 crore. The finance adviser expects the ongoing reforms in tax administration, tough anti-evasion steps and a widened direct tax net will boost collections significantly. The budget outlay for fiscal 2007-08 represents a 100 per cent rise in just five years. The figure was Tk 43,904 crore in 2002-03.
