<TITLE> McClaren hails Owen after landmark goal against Estonia </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TALLINN, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England coach Steve McClaren believes Michael Owen has taken an important step in his recovery from long-term injury by scoring in the 3-0 victory over Estonia. Owen steered home England's third goal, and his first since a pre-World Cup friendly with Jamaica a year ago this week, in Wednesday's Euro 2008 Group E qualifying win. It was also his 23rd competitive England goal, beating Gary Lineker's record of 22, and took his overall tally to 37 from 82 internationals, just 12 short of Bobby Charlton's record of 49. Only Charlton, Lineker (48) and Jimmy Greaves (44) have scored more for England and, with the goal ending his personal drought triggered by a cruciate ligament injury at last year's World Cup, he appears, at 27, to have time to overtake them all. McClaren told reporters: "If there's one thing I'm really pleased about, it's him getting a goal, because goalscorers are like that. After being injured for a long while, you do wonder until you get that first one. He's got it. ALL-ROUND PERFORMANCE "It was an all-round performance with the work-rate that he put in. He was the one in the second half who had to drop back, help out in midfield and link play. And he did that very well." Owen, who made his Newcastle United comeback on April 30, had no doubts about his prospects, telling reporters: "I was raring to go from the first game." McClaren said the win rounded off a better spell for his team after an England 'B' victory over Albania and last week's 1-1 friendly draw with Brazil in the first senior international at the new Wembley Stadium. "Over the last three games we've looked a team, we've worked for each other," said McClaren, whose side had previously suffered a dip in form. "We had great attitude, we won our challenges and we've got to continue on that line." England are fourth in Group E on 14 points, trailing leaders Croatia (17 points), Israel (17) and Russia (15). England have five qualifiers remaining -- home and away against Russia and home to Israel, Croatia, and Estonia
