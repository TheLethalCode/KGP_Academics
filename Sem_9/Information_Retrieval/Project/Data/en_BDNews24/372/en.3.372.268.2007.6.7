 MUMBAI, June 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Indian court jailed one man for life and an ailing gangster for 10 years on Thursday for their roles in India's deadliest bomb attacks, which killed 257 people. The Mumbai court has found 100 people guilty for the attacks in 1993 in the financial capital, which police say were ordered by India's most wanted man, Dawood Ibrahim, a Muslim gangster who wanted to avenge the razing of a mosque by Hindu zealots in 1992. Sheikh Ali Sheikh Umar, who is in his late 30s, stood silently with his head down as he was sentenced to life in prison. He was found guilty of helping plan the attack, transporting explosives and taking part in an aborted mission to attack the city's civic headquarters. Ejaz Pathan, a gangster who controlled a large slice of the Mumbai underworld from Dubai until his deportation in 2003, had also been found guilty of plotting the attack, amongst other charges. But he was sentenced for only 10 years because he is suffering from a blood clot in the brain, high blood pressure and a debilitating backache. He had entered the court walking on a crutch. So far 73 people have been punished with jail terms and fines for planning and abetting the attack or illegal possession of weapons. Bollywood star Sanjay Dutt is the most high-profile of the convicts. He was found guilty of illegal possession of weapons, and could face up to 10 years in prison. No date has been set for his sentencing. Those sentenced so far include smugglers, petty criminals and a Bollywood producer, as well as policemen and customs officials who took bribes to let the explosives through. An 83-year-old man is among those jailed for life for planning the blasts
