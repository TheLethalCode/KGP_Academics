"It's a huge honour to go in as the defending champions," he added. Mahendra Singh Dhoni led a young Indian team to surprise success in South Africa in 2007 to ensure the game's newest format gained instant popularity in cricket's commercial hub. "I really have to take care of my economy rate and then I need to work on variations," said the wiry paceman, who was part of a losing Kolkata franchise in the ongoing Indian Premier League Twenty20 in South Africa. "In Twenty20, you need to have a good yorker and different kinds of slower balls. Also, I am looking to become an impact bowler because nothing else puts the opposing team back like losing early wickets." Sharma played his first Twenty20 international during the 2008 tour of Australia, nine months after making his test debut, and soon emerged as the leading fast bowler for his country.

India are in group A with Bangladesh and Ireland. The tournament starts in June 5
