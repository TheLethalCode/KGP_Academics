 Dhaka, May 18 (bdnews24.com)The two former chiefs of National Security Intelligence are parrying the questions tactfully during questioning by the Criminal Investigation Department investigators in connection with the sensational Chittagong 10-truck arms haul case, officials said. A team of investigators led by investigation officer Moniruzzaman Chowdhury, senior assistant police superintendent, questioned them for the second day at the port city's Dampara CID office since Monday morning. The special superintendent of Chittagong CID Md Muslim told bdnews24.com that retired major general Rezzaqul Haider and retired brigadier general Abdul Rahim did not disclose any information, said an official, who preferred to be unnamed because he was not authorised to brief the media. Another CID official refusing to be named said that the two former NSI chiefs were parrying many questions. The investigation official told the state lawyer and metropolitan public prosecutor Kamal Uddin that they were facing some problems to question them as they were former high-profile officials. The court granted three days to grill them on Sunday. Former NSI director Sahab Uddin in his confessional statement said the former NSI chiefs were involved in the smuggling of 10 truck-loads of arms and ammunition in Chittagong Sahab Uddin also said that an foreign intelligence agency was involved in offloading the arms and ammunitions while an UAE-based firm in supplying the arms. State lawyer Kamal Uddin told bdnews24.com that the NSI chiefs were avoiding the information elicited from Sahab Uddin during their statement recorded before the metropolitan magistrate. But he expected that crucial information would come out if they were put under extensive interrogation. The consignment of deadly arms and ammunition was hauled at Chittagong Urea Fertilizer Limited jetty on the midnight of Apr 1, 2004. Abdur Rahim was serving as the chief of NSI while Rezzaqul Haidar as the director of Counter Intelligence Bureau of DGFI during the arms haul. bdnews24
