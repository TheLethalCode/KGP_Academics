 NEW DELHI, Mon May 18, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Millions of Indians appeared to have jettisoned caste and linguistic identities to vote for good governance in India's general election, a trend that may change the new government's policies to win over voters, analysts said. A collection of regional and caste-based parties, which wanted to provide an alternative to the ruling Congress party and the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, lost badly. It marked a change from decades of parties believing they could rely on India's traditional alliances of caste, region and language rather than performance. People voted on issues such as good governance, the economy and leadership. "Those regional parties that failed to build hospitals, schools and roads in their patches have suffered the most, as people sided with those who can deliver," said political commentator Amulya Ganguli. The Congress-led coalition, which campaigned on a platform of higher farm growth and jobs for everyone, scored its best electoral performance in 18 years, returning to power with a stronger mandate. Voters appeared to have turned their back on parties that sought votes on the basis of caste. For example, the regional Rashtriya Janata Dal won only four seats in the impoverished eastern state of Bihar, down from 24 in the previous parliament. "People are looking for more wealth creation, stability and empowerment. The Congress party has addressed some of the concerns, including the massive loan waiver scheme for farmers," said political analyst Mahesh Rangarajan. SERIOUS SETBACK Mayawati, the leader of the Dalits, or the lowest in the Hindu caste hierarchy, had harboured prime ministerial ambitions but came up well short. Voters punished Mayawati's government in Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, accusing her of being more interested in erecting statues than development projects. Her Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) won 21 seats in the state, less than half the 45 it had hoped to win in order to become a key player in the formation of a new national government. "Identity-based politics have suffered a serious setback," said Rangarajan. Regional parties that were seen to have governed well were favoured. In Bihar, the ruling Janata Dal (United) party, which campaigned on a pro-farmer and development platform, took half of the 40 seats at stake there. But victory comes at a price, analysts said. For Congress, winning the election may yet prove easier than living up to the massive expectations of the millions of poor Indians who voted for development and stability. Among the challenges facing the party is expanding its development projects, including a rural jobs guarantee scheme that now leaves out millions in small towns and cities at a time when the combined budget deficit is touching 10 percent of GDP. "The election is behind us and now hard work must begin. This is the time not for jubilation, but for sober introspection," Congress chief Sonia Gandhi told party mem
