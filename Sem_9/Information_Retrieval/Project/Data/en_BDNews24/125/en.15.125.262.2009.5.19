 Dhaka, May 19 (bdnews24.com)The government will use the personal data on national identity cards to make machine-readable passports, the home minister said on Tuesday. The decision came from an inter-ministerial meeting on Tuesday, Sahara Khatun told reporters. Army will help complete the project named 'Introduction of Machine Readable Passport & Machine Readable Visa in Bangladesh' and set for a July start, she said. Tk 283 crore had been allocated for implementing the project expected to complete in June in 2014, the minister added. Khatun further said that a technical committee, led by the home secretary, had been formed to oversee the scheme. The committee will provide samples of red, black, white and yellow passports and one will be picked, she said. The Department of Immigration & Passports will not issue any manual passports after Apr 30, 2010, according to the minister. However, those who will carry valid manual passports will not face any problem and they will not get machine-readable passports during renewal, she further said. Finance minister A M A Muhith, state minister for home Tanjim Ahmed, home secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikdar, director of photo-based voters' roll project brigadier general Shahad Hossain Chowdhury and officials with the passport departments, army and different agencies were present at the meeting. Muhith said the recommendation to merge the facts of national ID cards with passports was aimed to prevent forgery and theft at land offices, police, local government and courts. The passports will be digitised if the Election Commission's database is tapped, he said. The project director will be appointed 'very soon' to issue machine readable passports and visas, Tanjim Ahmed said. As many as 1.2 crore people bear manual passports. The government, which issues 10 lakh passports every year, plans to remove manual passports after 2015. bd
