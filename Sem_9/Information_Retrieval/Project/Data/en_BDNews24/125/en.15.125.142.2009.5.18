 Dhaka, May 18 (bdnews24.com)The parliament secretariat stickers provided to MPs are "widely being abused", chief whip Abdus Shahid said on Monday. The stickers pasted on the windscreen of vehicles enable the MPs to escape from police checking and get VIP treatment at all public entities. After a meeting of the parliament's House Committee, which looks after facilities for MPs, Shahid on Monday said his committee would propose a new sticker only for the use of the MPs, their spouses and children. "Now, we see massive misuse of the stickers. Many people having good relations with the MPs move freely on the vehicles with the stickers," Shahid told bdnews24.com after the meeting at parliament building. "The speaker and all of the committee members have similar view," he said. The chief whip said MPs did not use particular vehicles always. In their absence, anyone can use the same without trouble. "It must stop." Shahid said he would seek opinion of the MPs to stop the abuse. "I will propose introduction of a new type of sticker for exclusive use by the MPs, their spouses and children," he said. On giving all MPs offices, the chief whip said, "We have been trying our best to allocate offices before the upcoming budget session." He said a lot of formalities were to be done to convert former MP hostel buildings into offices of the MPS. Speaker Abdul Hamid in early May announced that the MPs will have offices in Dhaka.
