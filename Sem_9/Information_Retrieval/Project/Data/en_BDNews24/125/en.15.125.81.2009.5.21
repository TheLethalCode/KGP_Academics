 Los Angeles, May 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Wednesday a Texas federal jury ordered the company to pay Canadian software firm i4i Ltd $200 million in damages for infringing a patent. The world's largest software company, which is involved in a number of legal battles over patents, said the award was unsupported, and plans to appeal. Toronto-based i4i, a privately held maker of software for manipulating documents, claimed in a 2007 suit that Microsoft knowingly infringed one of its patents in its Word processing application and its Vista operating system. The patent concerned software for manipulating a document's content and architecture separately. Microsoft denied infringement throughout the case. "The evidence clearly demonstrated that we do not infringe and that the i4i patent is invalid," a Microsoft spokesman said. "We believe this award of damages is legally and factually unsupported, so we will ask the court to overturn the verdict." i4i did not immediately return a call seeking comment. Last month, Microsoft was ordered to pay $388 million in damages for infringing a patent held by anti-piracy software maker Uniloc Inc. It also appealing that verdict.
