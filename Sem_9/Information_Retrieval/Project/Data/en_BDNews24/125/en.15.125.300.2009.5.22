 NEW DELHI, Fri May 22, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manmohan Singh will be sworn in for a second term as prime minister on Friday after a key southern ally said it would leave the ruling alliance due to a row over ministerial positions.

In a possible reshuffle within Congress, foreign minister and party stalwart Pranab Mukherjee may again take over the finance ministry portfolio, a post he held in the 1980s.
