<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 17 (bdnews24.com)The civil aviation minister has suggested Biman Bangladesh Airlines to re-advertise the position of chief executive officer. "We're searching for someone with experience in airlines business. I've told the board of directors (of Biman) 'you can re-advertise if necessary to find an experienced CEO'," GM Quader told bdnews24.com on Sunday. The finance director of Biman, AM Mosaddique Ahmed, is acting as chief executive officer since Apr 5 following the resignation of Zahed Kuddus, a former regulatory official with no experience in business management. A prior advertisement for the positions in early Apr asked for application from people with 15 years' experience in the aviation industry and 35 applications were dropped. It also asked for five years' experience in management and airlines marketing. "Most of the applicants have experiences of working with the Air Force, Biman's board of directors and the country's private airlines," a member of Biman's board said on condition of anonymity. "It's difficult to get an efficient CEO; we could have considered if we got any expatriate Bangladeshi who has worked in foreign airlines," he said. An expatriate Bangladeshi working with an Australian airliner has also applied, he said. But he works in environment department and has no experience in airlines business. bd
