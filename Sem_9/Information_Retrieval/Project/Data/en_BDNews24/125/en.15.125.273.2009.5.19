 LONDON, Tue May 19, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Speaker of Britain's lower house of parliament will announce his resignation on Tuesday after criticism of his handling of a scandal over lawmakers' expenses, a Labour lawmaker said. Michael Martin would become the most senior figure to step down after parliamentarians' claims for everything from manure to porn films triggered public outrage across Britain and opposition calls for an early general election. "The Speaker is making a statement to say he is going to retire in the summer," Labour MP Tony Wright told reporters. The last Speaker to be forced from the post was John Trevor, who lost the confidence of the house in 1695 for taking a bribe. There was no immediate comment available from Speaker Martin's office. The Speaker is the most senior official in parliament and his departure would escalate the crisis engulfing British politics. Martin has been criticized for opposing transparency on lawmakers' expenses. The reputation of parliament has been damaged by a series of reports in the Daily Telegraph on how members milked the expenses system to supplement an annual salary of around 65,000 pounds ($100,700). Conservative opposition leader David Cameron, who is well ahead in the opinion polls before a parliamentary election due by June 2010, said a "very angry" public was more concerned about having an early chance to vote than the choice of Speaker. "They want to elect a new parliament," he told BBC radio. "Their view is that swapping one person in a funny black costume for another funny black costume is not actually going to make all the difference." It remains to be seen if the Speaker's departure quells public anger over the scandal and allows for an overhaul of the discredited expenses system or simply fuels momentum for parliament to be dissolved and a general election held. "I'm in no doubt that Speaker Martin has been an obstacle to reform, and although he is by no means the only problem, changing the Speaker is a necessary step to take to deal with the allowances and expenses fiasco," opposition Liberal Democrat member of parliament Norman Baker told BBC television. FRINGE PARTIES Prime Minister Gordon Brown, grappling with the worst recession since World War Two, is certain to resist calls for an early election. Brown has called for fundamental reform of the expenses system to try to defuse a scandal that has damaged all the main political parties but is hitting his own Labour Party hardest after 12 years in power. Brown called a news conference for 5.30 p.m. (12:30 p.m. EDT) on Tuesday after a scheduled meeting with the Speaker and leaders of other political parties to discuss expenses. "We expect the meeting at 4 p.m. to be with Speaker Martin," Brown's spokesman
