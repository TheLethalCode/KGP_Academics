<TITLE> Obama defends Guantanamo closure </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 By Arshad Mahmud Washington, May 22 (bdnews24.com)Only a day after suffering a major setback in his attempt to secure funding from the Congress for the closure of Guantanamo Bay prison, President Obama went on the offensive on Thursday, saying the policies of his predecessor were based on fear ideology rather than sound strategic principles. "We are indeed at war with al Qaeda and its affiliates. We do need to update our institutions to deal with this threat. But we must do so with an abiding confidence in the rule of law and due process; in checks and balances and accountability," Obama said at the National Archives here. "Too often, our government made decisions based upon fear rather than foresight, and all too often trimmed facts and evidence to fit ideological predispositions," he said. Moments after his speech, former Vice President Dick Cheney offered a sharp rebuke to Obama's criticisms of the Bush administration. "The administration seems to pride itself on searching for some kind of middle ground in policies addressing terrorism," Cheney said at the American Enterprise Institute, a Conservative think tank in Washington. "But in the fight against terrorism, there is no middle ground, and half-measures keep you half exposed." In his typical professorial style, Obama explained why his administration needed to reverse the Bush Administration policies that "established an ad hoc legal approach for fighting terrorism that was neither effective nor sustainable." In a speech that ran nearly 50 minutes, Obama laid out his case for ending so-called enhanced interrogation methods, closing the detention center Guantanamo Bay and moving detainees currently held there. He stressed that he inherited these complex legal and ethical questions from the previous administration. "We are cleaning up something that is -- quite simply -- a mess; a misguided experiment that has left in its wake a flood of legal challenges that my administration is forced to deal with on a constant basis, and that consumes the time of government officials whose time should be spent on better protecting our country," he said. Obama said the toughest issue facing his administration, and the one that is causing him headaches, concerns the detainees at Guantanamo who cannot be prosecuted but also cannot be released because of the threat they pose. He, however, did not lay out a specific plan for these terror suspects but said there must be "clear, defensible and lawful standards for those who fall in this category." "We must have fair procedures so that we don't make mistakes. We must have a thorough process of periodic review, so that any prolonged detention is carefully evaluated and justified," he said. Obama repeatedly pointed the finger at the Bush administration for what he called "a series of hasty decisions" that, while "motivated by a sincere desire to protect the American people," led to controversial policies on interrogation and detention of terrorists. "Instead of strategically applying our power and our principles, we too often set those principles aside as luxuries that we could no longer afford," he said. He stressed that the problem of how to move forward with Guantanamo Bay detainees is not a result of his decision to close the facility, but rather the detention center's existence. Even the Supreme Court was not spared a rebuke from the president on this issue. "The Supreme Court that invalidated the system of prosecution at Guantanamo in 2006 was overwhelmingly appointed by Republican Presidents," he said
