 Dhaka, May 21 (bdnews24.com)The budget for 2009-10 fiscal year will target fetching Tk 80,000 crore in revenue, the finance minister has said. The coverage of tax will also be considerably widened but people will not be weighed down under new taxes, under any circumstances, A M A Muhith told reporters after attending a pre-budget view-exchange meeting with the Newspaper Owners Association of Bangladesh on Thursday. "The total revenue earning target spanning all sectors covered by the NBR and otherwise under the FY 2008-09 budget had been fixed at Tk 69, 382 crore, which will be increased to Tk 80,000 in the forthcoming budget," he said. The minister said tax-levying structure will be so laid out in the new budget that local industries are protected and commodity prices remain within everybody's reach.

Though the newspaper owners have implemented the seventh wage board recommendations, the government in its turn has not yet increased its advertisement tariffs, he complained. Nor the advertisement bills are paid in time, he said. bd
