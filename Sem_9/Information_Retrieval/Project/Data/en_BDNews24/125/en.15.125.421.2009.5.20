<TITLE> Schoolboy Alfie not father of baby after all </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, May 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Schoolboy Alfie Patten, who made headlines earlier this year when it was reported he had got his girlfriend pregnant when aged just 12, is not the baby's father after all, the Sun said Tuesday. In February, media said Patten's 15-year-old girlfriend Chantelle Stedman had fallen pregnant after a night of unprotected sex, possibly making Patten Britain's youngest father when she gave birth to daughter Maisie. "I thought it would be good to have a baby. I didn't think about how we would afford it," he told the Sun at the time. "I don't really get pocket money. My dad sometimes gives me 10 pounds." But after the story was reported, other boys came forward to say they had had sex with Stedman. The Sun said DNA tests had now revealed that Patten was not the baby's father. Instead Maisie is the daughter of another schoolboy, Tyler Barker, who was 14 at the time Stedman conceived. The results were revealed after a judge lifted a court injunction and said Patten was "extremely distressed" at the news.
