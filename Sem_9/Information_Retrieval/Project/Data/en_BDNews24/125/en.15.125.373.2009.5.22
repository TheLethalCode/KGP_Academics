 Rohan Ziad bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, May 21 (bdnews24.com)The young man comes out from a grimy public toilet and spits quite a few times. "It's so filthy that it makes you throw up," says Hiron, pointing to the Dhaka City Corporation-run public toilet at Gulistan. The floor of the toilet was overflowing with dirty water and reeked of a foul, putrid stench. One needs to be very careful while standing in front of the wash-basin or urinal to escape from the dirty water all over the toilet. "The lessee just collects money from us but hardly spends anything to keep it clean," complains Hiron, who runs a shop close by. This is a regular sight in any public toilet in capital Dhaka. Poorly maintained, most of them are barely usable. The rundown look says that the contractors used shoddy materials and toilet fittings. In a city of over 1 crore inhabitants, the DCC runs only 48 public toilets, according to statistics obtained from the DCC website. Similar conditions have been found on a visit to the public toilets in the city's Tejgaon, Karwan Bazaar, Shahbagh, Mohammadpur, Rayer Bazaar and Azimpur area. But the common people are in some way forced to use these grubby toilets and pay for it. A middle-aged man was seen arguing with the man responsible to collect money from the users outside the public toilet beside the amusement park at Shahbagh. "Why should I pay? You don't use the money to keep it clean." But the man is forced to pay. "This is simply extortion...my clothes got dirty from the running water of this toilet," Tabibul Islam, who is in his mid-forties, tells this correspondent. The man sitting at the door says it is not his job to keep it clean. "My duty is to collect the money from the users, nothing else," he announces. Ramesh, a sweeper of a public toilet, says most of the time he has to clean the toilet with only water. He gets no regular supply of bleaching powder from authorities. Dr Nazrul Islam of the medicine department at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University says one can contract diseases like diarrhoea, cholera and parasite infections using unhygienic toilets. "In some cases, though rare, one can get infected with venereal diseases like syphilis," he says. An DCC official says they laid down some provisions for public toilets. "It included high and low commodes, urinals, basin, breast-feeding space and dressing room for women and even separate entrances for men and women, " he says asking not to be named as he was not authorised to brief the media. Most of the toilets do not have these facilities. The contractors used low-quality materials and toilet fittings and the toilets have worn down in no time. Admitting the poor management, the DCC official tells bdnews24.com said legal tangles between the city corporation and the lessees were the main reason behind the poor maintenance. "These lessees never follow their contracts and often don't pay the agreed rent to the DCC," he adds. The zonal offices of DCC handle lease and monitoring of the public toilets and the estate department takes care of the litigations pending, some since 1995. The lessees do not even pay the electricity or water bills on the pretext of pending litigations, according to the city corporation official. DCC employees of the zonal offices decline to say anything about the maintenance and legal disputes over the public toilets without instruction from the higher authorities.
