<TEXT>
 MANCHESTER, England, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United defender John O'Shea will not get excited about the Champions League final against Barcelona until he actually sees his name on the teamsheet. The Ireland defender, who was on the bench for last season's final victory over Chelsea but did not feature in the match, is certain to play according to his manager Alex Ferguson. Ferguson took the unusual step on Wednesday of saying that O'Shea would start the match in Rome, describing him as an "unsung hero" of the Old Trafford squad. O'Shea, however, is refusing to get carried away. "The manager might have said something about me starting but you never take it for certain until you know for definite when he names the team in the team meeting," O'Shea told reporters. "You could say I have been rewarded for my patience but whether you are playing a bit part or a bigger part, I was always confident if I got a run in the team, I could show I could stay in it." O'Shea said it was the result that mattered rather than whether he plays. "It is going to be special game. I have played quite a bit in the Champions League this year and I have been fortunate we have got through to the final." United face a Barcelona team which has been rampant in front of goal this season, scoring 104 goals on the way to winning the Primera Liga title led by Samuel Eto'o, Lionel Messi and Thierry Henry. "We won't be attacking them too much because we know they have a huge attacking threat," O'Shea added. "But we are not too bad ourselves. "Our front three is just as good as theirs and we have to focus on ourselves. "We are going to show Barcelona huge respect but with our attacking threat they know they will have a tough job on their hands as well and we have to use it to our advantage.
