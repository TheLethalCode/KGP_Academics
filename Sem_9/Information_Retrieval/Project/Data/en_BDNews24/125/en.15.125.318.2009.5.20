 MILAN, May 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazilian Matuzalem and Real Zaragoza have been ordered to pay Shakhtar Donetsk almost 12 million euros ($16.35 million) for breach of contract, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) said on Tuesday. The midfielder signed a five-year deal with the Ukrainian club in 2004 but in July 2007 he told Shakhtar he was unilaterally terminating the contract and later joined Spain's Zaragoza before signing on loan for Lazio this season. Shakhtar went to FIFA and demanded they be paid 25 million euros, the figure which his contract said he would be allowed to leave for. The case ended up at CAS with the player and Zaragoza saying Shakhtar should only receive 2.3 million euros. The Swiss-based court has therefore come to a inbetween figure, taking away the salary Shakhtar have not had to pay among other factors. "Real Zaragoza is jointly and severally liable for the payment of the aforementioned amount," the CAS statement added
