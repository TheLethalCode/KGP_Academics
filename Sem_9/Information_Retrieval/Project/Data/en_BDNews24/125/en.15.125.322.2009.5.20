 Dhaka, May 20 (bdnews24.com) Finance minister A M A Muhith on Wednesday refused to budge from his stance that the next budget will not offer tax holiday and dismissed suggestions that the facility should be continued with to encourage new industries. On Tuesday, the chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on finance ministry, A H M Mostafa Kamal, said the minister's announcement that there will be no more new tax holiday was "irresponsible".. "Whoever says whatever. I personally still believe there is no need to offer tax holiday," the minister told reporters after an inter-ministerial meeting on old-age allowance at the Secretariat. The industries already enjoying the facility would continue to do so until the time specified, he said and added that the cabinet would make a final decision. "The parliamentary committee can make recommendations on a matter. (But) I don't think it wise to continue with the tax holiday facility that has long been abused," Muhith said in an echo of his statement on May 14. "Industries established under tax holiday see profits as long as they enjoy the facility. But when the holiday ends, they count losses and eventually shut down," he had said, explaining the reason for the decision. Mostafa Kamal, better known as Lotus Kamal, claimed in a protest letter to bdnews24.com on Wednesday that the electronic media broadcast a 'confusing, false news' 'citing bdnews24.com'. ( See his letter in Bangla ) The fact, however, is that no electronic media had run the news, crediting bdnews24.com with it. Kamal had also said on Tuesday, "We've suggested for expansion of tax holiday facilities. We know the facilities are necessary for industrialisation." bdnew
