 Dhaka, May 17 (bdnews24.com)The High Court on Sunday allowed former prime minister Khaleda Zia to file a supplementary petition contesting the government's notice asking her to vacate Dhaka Cantonment house. The bench of justices Syed Refaat Ahmed and Moyeenul Islam Chowdhury permitted her to swear an affidavit through her representative to file a supplementary petition questioning the legality of the May 7 government notice. Khaleda's lawyer Mahbubuddin Khokon said, "A supplementary petition challenging the legality of the supplementary notice has been filed. The bench will hear both the writ petition and the supplementary petition on Monday." The supplementary petition said when Khaleda had filed writ petition on May 3, the court deferred the hearing to May 10 on the government's assurance that she would not be harassed until then. But, the government in a supplementary notice on May 7 asked the main opposition BNP chief to explain in 15 days why she should not return the estate, including the cantonment house. The petition challenged the legality of the government's first notice and said the second notice was also illegal on the same ground. The supplementary notice was sent to Khaleda only to persecute her and it contradicted the constitution and law, the petition said. Her lawyers appealed to the court to permit her to swear the affidavit as the registrar's office of the Supreme Court had not allowed her to do so. The court on May 12 admitted the petition to overturn the government's decision to cancel the lease on her 6 Shaheed Mainul Road house. The government on May 7 asked the main opposition BNP chief to explain in 15 days why she should not return the estate, including the cantonment house. Earlier, her lawyer Moudud Ahmed said Khaleda cannot come to the court for security reasons. The court is set to hear on Tuesday the petition challenging the legality of the government's first notice. On April 20, the directorate of military land and cantonment served first notice on Khaleda to leave her residence within 15 days and later an amended notice was served on May 7
