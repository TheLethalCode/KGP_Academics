 Dhaka, May 17 (bdnews24.com) A parliamentary panel has asked the sports ministry to remove the portrait of BNP's founder General Ziaur Rahman from Bangabandhu National stadium. The parliamentary standing committee on the youth and sports ministry at a meeting on Sunday also recommended renaming 17 youth training centres and stadiums after the family members of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, fondly called Bangabandhu. The committee formed a three-member sub-committee, headed by ruling party MP Mahbub Ara Gini, to suggest modalities for name changes. Mizanur Rahman Khan and Golam Faruk Khan Prince are the other members of the sub-committee which will submit its findings in the next 14 days. "We have recommended removing Ziaur Rahman's portrait placed beside Bangabandhu's image," Zahid Ahsan Russel, the standing committee chairman, told bdnews24.com after the meeting at parliament building. "Placing other's' portrait beside Bangabandhu's is not acceptable. "We must look into how it was placed," he said. The BNP after coming to power in 2001 placed huge portraits of Zia besides Sheikh Mujib's images around Bangabandhu National Stadium. On nomenclature of stadiums and youth training centres, Russel said the BNP changed the names of 17 stadiums and youth training centres which were names after "Sheikh Hasina, Sheikh Kamal, Sheikh Jamal and others". "The parliamentary sub-committee will recommend how the 17 centres and stadiums could be renamed , the chairman said. State minister for youth and sports Ahad Ali Sarker, according to the chairman, told the meeting that he would have talks with prime minister Sheikh Hasina on changing the names of the centres and stadiums. The ruling Awami League and its arch rival the BNP had been involved in the politics of nomenclature. The Awami League in its 1996-2001 term named many institutes after Sheikh Mujib and his family members including Hasina.
