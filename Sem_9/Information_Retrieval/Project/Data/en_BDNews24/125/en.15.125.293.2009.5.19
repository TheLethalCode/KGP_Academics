 Rajshahi, May 19 (bdnews24.com)Rajshahi transport owners and workers have adjourned for a week a strike after a meeting with the district administration at around 9:30pm on Tuesday. The decision took immediate effect, Rajshahi Road Transport Association general secretary Manzur Rahman Peter said. Road communication between Rajshahi and the rest of the country remained suspended since morning after transport owners and workers had gone into strike. The group said on Monday that they wanted trial of those responsible for setting fire to a bus last week and were seeking damages. Angry locals, when a bus hit and killed two motorcycle riders at Paba on May 12, set fire to the bus. The bus owner later sued 13 people. The owners and workers demonstrated at many places including Shiroil bus stand, Palaimari crossing and Binodpur. They did not allow any movement of commercial buses through the terminal. Two double-decker buses tried and failed to enter the terminal. Police were on guard, patrolling the key spots. bdnews24.c
