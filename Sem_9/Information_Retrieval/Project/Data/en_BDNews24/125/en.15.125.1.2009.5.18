 Dhaka, May 18 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary watchdog, Estimate Committee, has suggested immediate extraction of coal from the five mines including the much-talked about Phulbari coal field. But the committee, which makes estimates on public affairs, made no recommendations on the mining methodsopen-pit or underground. "The committee has recommended that coal from our five mines should immediately be extracted for producing energy," H N Ashequr Rahman, the chairman, told bdnews24.com after Monday's meeting at parliament building. He said the committee suggested the energy ministry find ways to extract coals at "minimum cost", but made no mention of the environmental aspects of coal extraction. The chairman said energy-hungry Bangladesh needed coal immediately for power generation, a precondition for development. "We have asked the ministry to submit a report on which method would be viable to extract coal from the fields," said the chairman. Bangladesh has five coal minesBarapukuria, Phulbari, Khalashpir, Dighipara and Jamalganj. The government is in dilemma over coal extraction from Phulbari filed in Dinajpur. The Phulbari people resisted a move of the UK-based Asia Energy to collect coal through open-pit mining on the grounds that it would make them homeless and destroy environment. In Aug 2006, three people were killed as law enforcers fired on the protesters who demanded the government scrap its deal with Asia Energy. In the face of strong protest, the government announced closure of Asia Energy's activities in Phulbari. Some groups supported mainly by the left parties have been waging movements to stop extraction of coal by open-cut method by foreign companies. The then main opposition and now ruling party Awami League extended support to the protesters.
