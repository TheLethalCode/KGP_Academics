<TEXT>
 Tokyo, May 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The number of cases of H1N1 flu virus in Japan climbed to 17 on Sunday, a health ministry official said, with media reporting more cases emerging after high school students from nearby cities in central Japan came down with the disease. Kyodo News said an additional four students had been confirmed as having caught the virus, which would bring the nationwide count to 21. Many of the affected students, who attend high schools in Kobe and Osaka in central Japan, have not been abroad, media reported. The health ministry official said it was not yet clear how the disease had spread between the two cities. The World Health Organisation said on Saturday it was closely monitoring the situation in Japan. It raised its pandemic alert on April 29 to 5 on a scale of 6, meaning a pandemic is imminent. Proof the disease was spreading in a region outside North America, where it originated, would trigger an increase to 6. Kobe city decided on Saturday to close some public schools for a week after the first eight cases were confirmed there. Health Minister Yoichi Masuzoe said on Saturday authorities would try to determine who had been in close contact with the infected students and take steps such as asking such people to stay at home in an effort to prevent the spread of the virus. The new virus is behaving much like a seasonal influenza strain -- spreading rapidly and causing mainly mild symptoms.
