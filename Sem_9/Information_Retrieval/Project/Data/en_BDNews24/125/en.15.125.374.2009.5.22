<TITLE> UK expenses row "unbearable," suicide feared: MP </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Fri May 22, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Disclosures in the British press about members of parliament's large expenses claims are a "McCarthy-style witch-hunt" that risks driving politicians to suicide, a British lawmaker said on Friday. Nadine Dorries, a member of the opposition Conservative party, wrote on her blog that the two-week scandal, in which the Daily Telegraph newspaper has disclosed how members of parliament have abused their expense allowances, was forcing politicians to breaking point. "The atmosphere in Westminster is unbearable," she wrote on the blog. "People are constantly checking to see if others are OK. Everyone fears a suicide.

Politicians have been heckled and shouted at in the street for their behavior and police are investigating whether there should be possible criminal charges. European and local elections to be held on June 4 are expected to reflect the level of popular disgust at the row, with lower voter turnout and a move toward fringe or secondary political parties predicted. Some MPs have tried to fight back, but largely been shouted down. Dorries, who is one of those to have been exposed in the newspaper for making claims for household goods, said it couldn't go on much longer. "This has got to a point now where it is almost unbearable for any human being to deal with," she
