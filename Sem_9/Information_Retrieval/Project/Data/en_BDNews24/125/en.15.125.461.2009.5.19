 CENTURION, South Africa, May 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Belligerent half-centuries by Brendon McCullum and Brad Hodge took the Kolkata Knight Riders to a seven-wicket victory off the last ball against the Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League on Monday.

The Chennai total of 188 for three was built around a rapid partnership of 74 for the third wicket between Suresh Raina (52) and Mahendra Singh Dhoni (40 not out).
