 LILONGWE, Fri May 22, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Malawi's President Bingu wa Mutharika will be sworn in for a second term on Friday after winning re-election in a ballot the opposition said he rigged. The Electoral Commission declared wa Mutharika the victor early on Friday in a vote widely viewed as a test for political stability in the southern African country. He also won a clear majority in the parliamentary vote, which should ease a standoff with the opposition that has almost paralysed government and unnerved donors and investors in the poor nation whose economy is one of the world's fastest growing. Wa Mutharika won 2.7 million votes in the presidential poll, with 93 percent of ballots counted. His closest rival John Tembo won 1.2 million.

The Economist Intelligence Unit says Malawi is the world's second-fastest growing economy. A Commonwealth election monitoring mission said wa Mutharika had exploited state TV and radio to gain an unfair advantage in the election but that the opposition should drop its protest. The Southern African Development Community (SADC) also noted media bias but said the vote was "credible ... and fair". Former president and UDF leader Bakili Muluzi, who was excluded from standing himself but had formed an alliance with Tembo, acknowledged wa Mutharika had won and said he would support the new government. Muluzi has been an arch rival of wa Mutharika and a protracted power struggle between the two almost paralysed parliament, prompting a failed impeachment bid and allegations of a coup plot that unnerved Western do
