<TITLE> ASEAN says Suu Kyi trial a `grave concern' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, Tue May 19, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Myanmar's Southeast Asian neighbors expressed `grave concern' on Tuesday at the trial of democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi, but the chair of their regional group, Thailand, ruled out sanctions. A day after European Union ministers said they hoped to cajole Asian governments into using their influence with Myanmar's generals, China said it would not interfere in the former Burma's affairs. In its first formal response to the trial, the 10-strong Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) said the "honor and credibility" of its troublesome member Myanmar was at stake and it urged "humane treatment and dignity" for Suu Kyi. "The Government of the Union of Myanmar, as a responsible member of ASEAN, has the responsibility to protect and promote human rights," Thailand said on behalf of the group. Suu Kyi, whose latest detention began in May 2003, is charged with violating her house arrest after an American intruder spent two days in her home this month. The media and public are barred from the trial in Yangon's Insein prison, which on its second day heard testimony from five prosecution witnesses before adjourning until Wednesday, her lawyers said. Critics say the charges, which could see her jailed for five years, are aimed at keeping the Nobel Peace laureate in detention until after elections in 2010. She has denied the charges. Since joining ASEAN in 1997, the generals have been a thorn in the group's relations with the West, which has repeatedly urged ASEAN to exert more pressure on the regime. Critics fear a proposed human rights body under a new ASEAN charter signed in 2007 will have no teeth, given the charter's commitment to the group's mantra of non-interference. Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva denied the group was too soft on Myanmar. "Events over the last week have raised concern and we expressed our concern very clearly, but our policy is to engage and continue to engage constructively," he told reporters. CHINA WON'T INTERFERE The European Union threatened tougher sanctions against the regime on Monday, four days after the United States renewed its measures against the military government. Some EU foreign ministers said Asian countries could exert a stronger influence on the generals and they planned to discuss it with their Asian counterparts in Hanoi next week. Analysts are skeptical the meeting will achieve anything. Neither sanctions nor engagement have gotten through to the generals, who are determined to press ahead with a "roadmap to democracy" that critics call a sham to entrench military rule. China -- which has a strong commercial eye on Myanmar and its abundance of timber, gas and minerals -- repeated its oft-made pledge that it would not interfere in its neighbor's affairs. "Events in Myanmar should be decided by the people of Myanmar," Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu told a regular news briefing. "As a neighbor of Myanmar, we hope all parties can realize reconciliation, stability and development through dialogue." Thailand, which shares a 1,800 km (1,100 mile) border with Myanmar, made clear on Monday that sanctions are not an option. "Thailand will not use strong measures or economic sanctions against Myanmar because it is not an appropriate resolution for the current problem," Foreign Ministry official Chavanond Intarakomalyasut told reporters. Aside from Thailand and Myanmar, ASEAN's membership includes Singapore, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei and the Philipp
