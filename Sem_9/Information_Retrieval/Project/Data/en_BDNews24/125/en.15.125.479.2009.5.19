<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 19 (bdnews24.com)  The BCB XI comprising of national cricketers lost by seven wickets in the third and final practice match against the Maharashtra Cricket Association at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Tuesday. It was the last warm-up match for the national cricketers before leaving for England on May 23 for the ICC Twenty20 World Cup in June. The BCB XI won the first match by 63 runs while the second match was called off due to rain at the same venue. Opener Harshad Khadiwale blazed 62 to propel the visitors to 118-3 with 13 balls to spare after the hosts were bundled out for 117 all out in 19.1 overs. Syed Rasel made the first breakthrough for the hosts dismissing opener Rohan Bhosale for one, but later the bowlers faced a brilliant batting display by Harshad and one-down Ameye Srikhande, who together put on 86 runs. Pacer Shahadat broke the second-wicket stand having Harshad caught by Rubel Hossain for 62 off 47 balls studded with seven fours and one six, but by this time the visitors needed just 29 runs off 36 balls. Srikhande fell with score on 106-3 in 16.2 overs after being caught by keeper Mithun off Rubel for 31 and Srikant Mundhe and Digamber Waghmare remained unbeaten on 11 and 6 to steer Maharashtra home. Earlier, opting to bat, the BCB XI were reduced to 40-6 in seven overs and never recovered from the damage. Lower top-order batsmen Mushfiqur Rahim and Naeem Islam added 60 runs for the seventh wicket to add respectability to their total. Mushfiqur played a 28-ball 39 that included two fours and one six while Naeem scored 27 off 33 balls. Opener Tamim Iqbal was the other batsman, who made 21 off 14 balls hammering four fours. Srikant Mundhe (4-33) and Kiran Adhav (3-23) shared seven wickets to wreck the hosts innings. bd
