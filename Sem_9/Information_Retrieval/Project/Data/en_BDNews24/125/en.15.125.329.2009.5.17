<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 17 (bdnews24.com)The High Court on Sunday ordered the Jahangirnagar University to reinvestigate the alleged incidents of sexual harassment at the university in line with new guidelines it laid down on such abuse. It also ruled illegal the university absolving teacher Sanwar Hossain Sunny from the charges of sexual harassment on a female student of the university, and expelling six students over the incident. The bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Quamrul Islam Siddiqi passed the judgment upon a public interest writ petition filed by Dhaka University teacher Sirajul Islam Chowdhury and four others challenging the legality of the university decisions. The bench cited judgments of the Supreme Courts of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan and said that corroboration was not always required to prove allegations of sexual violence. It also noted that the university authorities had failed 'for reasons best known to themselves' to adopt their own guidelines on sexual harassment, and therefore in the absence of any applicable law, the High Court's new guidelines should be applied to the fresh inquiry. The High Court on May 14 laid down a set of guidelines to prevent sexual harassment on women and children at work places, educational institutions and on the streets. It has defined the harassment and said the compliance of the guidelines was mandatory until those were passed into law in parliament. In May last year, four female students of the university filed complaints of serial sexual harassment against Sunny, chairperson of the drama and dramatics department. The university later formed three separate inquiry committees, which examined witnesses and filed reports. On Sept 2008, the university announced that Sunny was 'exonerated of all charges of sexual harassment as they had not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt'. The university then temporarily expelled the complainants and two male students who had testified in their favour. On Nov 27, Dhaka University teachers Sirajul Islam Chowdhury and Kamal Lohani, and human-rights organisations Ain o Salish Kendra, Nijera Kori and Kormojibi Nari in a writ petition with the High Court challenged the legality of the university actions. The court on Dec 1 asked the university to explain why the decisions should not be declared illegal. The students were represented by advocate Ruhul Quddus Babu. Barrister Sara Hossain, Dr. Shirin Sharmin Chowdhury and advocate Ramzan Ali Sikder appeared for the public interest petitioners
