 Dhaka, May 18 (bdnews24.com)The Election Commission will amend the law to extend the deadline for the political parties to submit their constitution to complete registration, the chief election commissioner said on Monday. "If the political parties fail to submit constitution by completing council by July 25 in line with the regulation of the registration, the commission will bring amendment," ATM Shamsul Huda told reporters after opening a workshop on updating voter lists at National Economic Council in Agargaon in Dhaka. "The Representation of People Order (registration regulations of the political parties) will be amended if the parties appeal for time to the commission," he added. As many as 39 parties have been registered with the commission by submitting temporary constitution in November and pledged to submit the final constitution within six months of the ninth parliament session, from Jan 25 to July 25,. The parties asked for deadline extension on the grounds that they could not hold council for various reasons including the Feb 25-26 BDR mutiny. The CEC said in the workshop that the commission would look into the matter considering the ground reality. Huda said the voter list updating will start countrywide by the end of June and done in four phases. "Voter registration will be complete within 45 days since the start of the work in each area. The updating will take four to five months to complete." The current list has 8.13 crore voters, which might increase about four percent after updating, the election chief said. Two other commissioners Muhammed Sohul Hussein and Mohammed Sakhawat Hussain, EC secretary Humayun Kabir and representatives of home, local government and information ministries were present in the workshop. bdnew
