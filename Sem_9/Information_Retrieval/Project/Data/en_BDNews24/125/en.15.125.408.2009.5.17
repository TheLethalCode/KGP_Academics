 Dhaka, May 17 (bdnews24.com)A Chittagong court on Sunday granted the CID police three days to question the former NSI chiefs in the sensational 10-truck arms haul case. The two former directors-general of National Security Intelligence were brought to the Metropolitan magistrate's Court at around 12:10pm. Chittagong metropolitan public prosecutor Kamal Uddin told bdnews24.com that they had appealed for five-day remand for interrogation. Earlier, CID police probing the case brought retired brigadier general Abdur Rahim and retired major general Rezzakul Haider Chowdhury to the office at Dampara in Chittagong Saturday night. Both the former NSI officials were arrested late Friday night. Rahim, then a retired officer, was appointed to the top NSI job by the BNP-led coalition government. Gen Chowdhury succeeded him later and was removed immediately after the army intervened to impose emergency on Jan 11, 2007. Chowdhury was also sent into retirement from the army. Police seized ten trucks loaded with arms at the secured jetty of Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Ltd on the midnight of Apr 1, 2004. On Friday, a Chittagong court sent to jail former NSI director (security) retired wing commander Shahabuddin after recording his confessional statement. Abu Hannan, a Chittagong Metropolitan magistrate, recorded his statement for three hours Friday afternoon. Investigation officer Moniruzzaman Chowdhury, a CID SSP, told bdnews24.com that Shahbuddin's statements were recorded from 3pm to 6pm, but declined to say what he disclosed in his 16-page written statement. He was remanded on May 9 for six days ending on Thursday. Earlier on May 3, he had been taken into three-day remand. Shahbuddin was arrested on May 3 at his house in Dhaka on the basis of NSI field officer Akbar Hossain Khan's confession. b
