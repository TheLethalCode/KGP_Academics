 Dhaka, May 20 (bdnews24.com)The government is buying dredgers to excavate crucial rivers to preserve water and make them navigable, the top Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority official said on Wednesday. As many as 57 rivers are being silted up, making it harder for vessels, BIWTA chairman Abdul Mannan Hawlader told bdnews24.com. Three dredgers, two worth Tk 170 crore financed by the government and one by BIWTA will be initially bought, he said. The government has allocated Tk 170 crore for the purchase of the two dredgers at the first ECNEC meeting, the chairman said. It will be possible for BIWTA to maintain the rivers and right their courses by removing silt, he said. Dredging will start after sufficient numbers of dredgers arrive in. Before that, river are being dug up where needed to keep their course, shipping minister Afsarul Amin said. Pressure on roads and public sufferings will reduce if river courses can be restored through dredging, the minister added. Hawlader said the BIWTA has now seven dredgers, two of which are being repaired. Two of the dredgers, which have been in for 35 years, were bought in 1972 and five in 1975, he said. But the BIWTA needs at least 20 dredgers, he pointed out. They have sent to the ministry a proposal for buying 17 more dredgers. The Water Development Board has 15/16 dredgers and Chittagong port has some more dredgers, he added. b
