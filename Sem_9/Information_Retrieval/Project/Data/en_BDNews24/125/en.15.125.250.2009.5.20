 LONDON, May 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Newcastle United will be without French defender Sebastian Bassong when they play for their Premier League survival against Aston Villa on Sunday. The 22-year-old was sent off by referee Howard Webb for a foul on Fulham defender Diomansy Kamara last week and the club lost their appeal on Tuesday. Bassong will also miss the first match of next season because he was also sent off against Wigan Athletic in December. Newcastle go into their final match in 18th place of the 20 clubs, just one point behind Hull City and two adrift of Sunderland
