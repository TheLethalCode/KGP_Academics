 Dhaka, May 17 (bdnews24.com)Former caretaker government adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam has said the development budget of Bangladesh is the lowest in the world. The Annual Development Programme should be expanded to generate more jobs, he said at a meeting with the Economic Reporters' Forum (ERF) on Sunday at the National Press Club. Finance minister AMA Muhith was also present. Muhith said, "The size of ADP in the next budget will be 30,500 crore taka. The ADP size in 2008-9 was 25,600 crore taka. It was later brought down to 23,000 crore taka due to lack of implementation. The budget size was 99.962 crore taka. Aziz advised the government to fully implement the revised ADP of Tk 23,000 crore. He also said the size of the next budget should be Tk 1,16,000 crore or 17 percent of GDP. The revenue expenditure should be Tk 79, 900 crore and revenue collection target should be more than Tk 60,000 crore. GDP growth should be 5.5 percent and Inflation confined to 6.5 percent, he added. Muhith agreed with Aziz on most of the proposals. "The new budget will be above 100, 000 crore taka. To face global recession and to implement the election manifesto, the budget will be ambitious," the minister said. He said he was not in favour of increase in individual tax threshold and said the should stay the same for next two years. It was raised to Tk 1,65,000 from Tk 1,50,000 under pressure from different professional groups. "The inflation has come down to a tolerable level. There is no point in increasing [the threshold] this time." The former finance adviser suggested no reduction in corporate tax since private sector banks are doing good. If the corporate tax is reduced, the revenue earning of the government will fall, he said. For banks corporate tax is 45 percent. Aziz said saving food there should be no tariff waiver on imports. "If zero-tariff is imposed on import of capital machinery and industrial raw materials, the government will lose revenue on one side and local industries will be affected on the other." On legalisation of ill-gotten income, the former adviser said, "Under any circumstances, opportunity should not be given to whiten black money. But the legally-earned money (undeclared income) can be allowed to be made legal on certain conditions." Despite recession, GDP in the current finacial year may be 5.9 percent, Aziz believed. He was in the same wavelength with the finance minister on not giving tax holiday for new industries. "There is no logic in granting tax holiday year after year. The finance minister said, "There will be no tax holiday any more. But industries given tax holiday will lose it after the due dates." Muhith bemoaned that merely seven lakh people out of a population of 145 million pay taxes. "It is a shame that people don't want to pay tax." He said the government would intervene in the market if the prices of goods go up. The government will also import commodities through the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh. bd
