 Dhaka, May 20 (bdnews24.com)The government has been urged by Islamist and Left parties to immediately engage in dialogue with India to halt the construction of Tipaimukh dam. Opposition Jamaat-e-Islami suggested that the government formed an all-party panel to sit in talks with India. Tipaimukh is located 500 metres downstream from the confluence of Barak and Tuivai rivers and lies on the south-western corner of Manipur state in India. "The destruction will be as grave as that of a nuclear bomb explosion in Bangladesh if dam is erected at Tipaimukh, Jamaat-e-Islami chief Matiur Rahman Nizami said on Wednesday. "This dam will render one-one third of our country desert," he said at a rally in Dhaka. He pointed out that the northern region of Bangladesh has been devoid of vegetation and the flora and fauna after India built Farakka dam. "Indian made many promises to Bangladesh before Farakka dam was erected. But those were not later kept." "India has to be forced to stop erecting the dam at Tipaimukh," he said. Two left parties also protested the remarks of Indian high commissioner on Tuesday that the Tipaimukh hydropower project over the cross-boundary river Barak would not harm Bangladesh. "The high commissioner's statement does not hold ground amid common perception and expert opinions," Bangladesh Samajtantrik Dal convenor Khalequzzaman said in a statement on Wednesday. He said if the Tipaimukh dam is built, the water flow in Bangladesh's Surma-Kushiara will lessen in the winter and the agriculture will face serious catastrophe. Khalequzzaman urged the government to protest the issue immediately and if necessary, take it to the international forum. A separate statement, signed by the president of Bangladesher Biplobi Communist Party Khandker Ali Abbas, said the proposed Tipaimukh dam was going to be another Farakka. The high commissioner, Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty, had said the Tipaimukh project was not like the Farakka irrigation project. A little amount of water will be diverted to produce hydroelectricity and the water will be released soon. Bangladesh should not be wary of the project, he had said. Bilateral discussions have long been on-going on the project and the Indian government has invited Bangladesh to see the dam site and its design. Environmentalists fear the dam will dry up the Meghna river in the greater Sylhet region. India in 2003 initiated the move to construct the dam over the cross-boundary river, which enters into Bangladesh through Sylhet region before meeting the Meghna. It started the construction later last year without consulting Bangladesh. Bangladesh gets 7 to 8 percent of its total water from the Barak in India's northeastern states. Millions of people are dependent on hundreds of water bodies, fed by the Barak, in the Sylhet region for fishing and agricultural activities. Environmentalists in Bangladesh have held many talks on the adverse impact of the proposed dam. They say the dam would dry up the river and the water bodies in the downstream, leaving millions jobless and upsetting the ecological balance. bd
