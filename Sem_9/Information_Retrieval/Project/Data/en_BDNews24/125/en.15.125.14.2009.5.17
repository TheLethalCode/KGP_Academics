 Dhaka, May 17 (bdnews24.com)The Awami League on Sunday questioned the authenticity of army investigation report on BDR mutiny excerpts of which have been run by some newspapers. The ruling party's spokesman Syed Ashraful Islam said: "If the published report was correct, I would say that it was done intentionally to hide the truth and implicate AL leaders to prove that the government was behind it." He said Tk 15 crore is being spent on talk shows on TV channels on the mutiny to smear the government. Ashraf, also local government minister, said the report published in the newspaper was 'incomplete and a new conspiracy.' Agriculture minister Matia Chowdhury said, "Many rebels covered their faces with handkerchief of three different colours, which is the symbol of a militant organisation in Bangladesh." "When they mentioned so many things why did not they describe how ash, yellow and orange-red handkerchief reached there? The handkerchiefs of those three colours are symbol of three layers of a particular militant outfit operating in Bangladesh." The AL leaders spoke at a programme to mark the homecoming day of party chief and prime minister Sheikh Hasina in 1981. bdn
