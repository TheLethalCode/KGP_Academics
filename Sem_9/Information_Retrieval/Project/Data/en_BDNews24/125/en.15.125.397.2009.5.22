During five occasionally grueling spacewalks, astronauts also repaired two of the telescope's instruments that were never intended to be worked on in space. The Atlantis crew's refurbishments should keep the observatory on the cutting edge of scientific research until at least 2014 when its replacement, the infrared-sensitive James Webb Space Telescope, is scheduled to be in orbit. NASA has one final landing opportunity on Friday to bring Atlantis home. "There is some hope that a little bit later there are some openings (in the weather)," Herring said.
