<TEXT>
 Shariatpur, May 21 (bdnews24.com)The chief election commissioner on Thursday said that the Election Commission was mulling over enacting laws to free elections of influences by ministers and MPs. "Before bye-elections, I requested the speaker in a letter to see that no member of the parliament or minister should visit a constituency where bye-election would be held. But many did not pay heed to the request," ATM Shamsul Huda said. "Election laws should be reformed more. We do not want to do anything unilaterally. The reform issue will be decided in consultation with political parties," he told journalists at a views-exchange meeting at the Faridpur circuit house. There are possibilities of holding city corporation, municipal and Union Parishad elections by December, Huda said. To facilitate the deployment of the law-enforcing members, those elections will be held division-wise. Asked about the irregularities in the Upazila elections, the polls chief said, "Upazila elections in the country were held in a single day. In that case some irregularities might have occurred. "But we have conducted judicial investigations into complaints made to us." He also said they were working 'without any interference'. bdnews
