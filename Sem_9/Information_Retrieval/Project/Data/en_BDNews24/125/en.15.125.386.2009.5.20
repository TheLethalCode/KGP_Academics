<TITLE> Obama unveils watershed plan for US auto industry </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 By Arshad Mahmud Washington, May 20 (bdnews24.com)President Barack Obama unveiled a new energy plan on Tuesday that will pave the way for America to substantially cut its oil import and make the country more environmentally friendly within the next six years. Announcing the plan at a White House ceremony Obama said the new plan would require auto companies to make cars that will run 35 miles per gallon instead of the current 25 miles per gallon. At the same time, the auto companies will have to follow the new environmental guidelines in order to reduce carbon emissions. The announcement marked a watershed in American automobile industry because no other president in the past could achieve what Obama accomplished on Tuesday by bringing together the adversariesthe auto company executives who resisted pressures to make fuel-efficient cars and the environmental groups who have been fighting to cut gas emissions. The implementation of the plan will put an end to the monopoly of the Ford Motor Company, whose Ford F-150 has been America's best-selling vehicle for 27 years, averaging only 14 to 21 miles per gallon. The average for all cars is about 25 miles per gallon. With Obama's new plan, automobile experts say car design will inevitably conform to fit the new energy-efficient standards. "You're going to see more small cars," says Joe Wiesenfelder, senior editor of Cars.com. "You're gonna see more roominess inside and smaller on the outside. You're going to see more hybrids, you're going to see electrics." Many Americans equate high-mileage with small cars. For example, the Ford Focus already meets the president's new mileage standard of 35 miles per gallon -- but with its smaller size, it's a tight fit for some. However, comfort and economy are not necessarily mutually exclusive concepts. Hybrid sport utility vehicles, sedans and crossovers -- vehicles that blur the traditional lines between cars, minivans and SUVs -- are already on the road. "You probably get more bang for the buck on the bigger cars in terms of mileage savings than you do on the smaller ones," said Joe Bredemann, president of the Bredemann Ford dealership in Illinois. Nonetheless, American car companies are already retooling. On Tuesday, Ford opened a plant in Cleveland making new V-6 engines that produce V-8 power with even less gas. Gary Dilts, vice president of J.D. Power and Associates, a rating agency, predicts that over the next few years, automakers will build more compacts, and fewer pick-up trucks and SUVs. Meeting the new standards within seven years, however, will come at a price. The White House estimates it will cost an estimated extra $1,300 per vehicle. Auto industry experts say the additional expense is expected to be passed on to the consumer. "Consumers will pay more for cars. There is no doubt about it. The money has to come from somewhere," Wiesenfelder said. The Environmental Protection Agency, however, estimates savings from higher gas mileage vehicles will allow consumers to break even in 3.2 years. Still, automakers embracing the stricter standards after years of fighting them now have to convince their customers to do the s
