 LONDON, May 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England batsman Kevin Pietersen will miss the one-day series against West Indies because of an Achilles tendon injury in his right leg. Pietersen said the injury was likely to heal in time for the Ashes series against Australia starting in July and next month's World Twenty20. "The medical advice is to rest the Achilles and although I'm frustrated to be leaving a happy and successful dressing room I'm absolutely confident this will help me overcome what has up until now been a minor ongoing injury," Pietersen said in a statement issued by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). "I hate missing out on playing for England but understand that in this instance it's necessary in order to overcome the injury. I was looking forward to playing a significant part in what should be an exciting and closely fought series." The first of the three one-day internationals against West Indies is at Headingley on Thursday with the other two matches scheduled for Sunday and next Tuesday. "Even though I won't be lining up for England during this series I'll be watching and supporting the team closely as they set about repeating the recent one-day series win in the Caribbean," Pietersen said. "I'm looking forward to being back in the England lineup for the World Twenty20 and the rest of an exciting summer of cricket." ECB chief medical officer Nick Pierce said Pietersen's injury had flared up after the second test against West Indies, which England won by an innings and 83 runs on Monday to complete a 2-0 series win. "The injury would not necessarily prevent him from playing but by giving him a precautionary period of time out to receive some concentrated treatment and rest we are enabling the niggle to settle down in preparation of the ICC World Twenty20 and the Ashes," Pierce said in the ECB statement. "This is not an injury that would preclude him from participating in either event." The World Twenty20 begins on June 5 while the Ashes series starts in Cardiff on July 8
