 Kathmandu, May 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States and EU countries have urged Nepal's feuding political parties to quickly form a new government after the resignation of a Maoist-led coalition sparked turmoil in the nascent republic. Maoist Prime Minister Prachanda quit early May after his move to fire the army chief was vetoed by the president, precipitating a crisis that threatens the 2006 peace deal after a decade-long civil war. A bloc of 22 parties with a majority in parliament has been unable to form a new government as the former Maoist guerrillas vowed to block the process, launching street protests and disrupting parliament sittings. Heads of international missions said in a statement late on Wednesday that parliament must be allowed to choose a new government, in what analysts said was an appeal mainly to the Maoists to co-operate. The Maoists' involvement is seen as key, holding nearly 40 percent of seats in parliament, the largest of any party. Old enmity and mistrust between the other political factions makes the task of forming a new government even more difficult. Heads of missions "hope that a new government can be formed as quickly as possible to allow the parties, inside and outside government, to work together to deliver on the key commitments of the peace process", the Embassy of Finland said. The EU and the United States are key donors to aid-and-tourism dependent Nepal, one of the world's poorest countries. "Obviously they are looking forward to the formation of a government with legitimacy," political analyst Yubaraj Ghimire said. "It is only natural that they advise the Maoists to cooperate in the process." The Maoists ended their conflict three years ago, locked up their arms in containers and confined fighters to U.N. monitored camps under the landmark deal. They were unhappy with General Rookmangud Katawal, the army chief once seen as loyal to the now deposed monarchy, because he was opposed to their plans to integrate 19,000 former guerrillas in the army, saying they were politically "indoctrinated".
