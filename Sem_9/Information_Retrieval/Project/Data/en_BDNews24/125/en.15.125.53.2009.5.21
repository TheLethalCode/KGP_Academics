 DUBLIN, May 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Ireland goalkeeper Alan Kelly senior has died at the age of 72 following a long battle with illness, the Football Association of Ireland announced on Thursday. Capped 47 times by his country between 1958 and 1973, Kelly made more than 500 appearances for Preston North End and gained a runners-up medal when they lost to West Ham United in the 1964 FA Cup final at Wembley. His son Alan played 34 times for Ireland and is the current goalkeeping coach of the national side while another son Gary played for Newcastle United, Bury and Oldham Athletic in a 20-year career. FAI president David Blood described Kelly as "one of Ireland's greatest ever goalkeepers" while FAI chief executive John Delaney added: "Alan Kelly Sr was a stalwart of the Irish team during the 1960s and will always be remembered as one of our greatest ever goalkeepers, a man who wore the Irish jersey with pride and always served his country with distinction.
