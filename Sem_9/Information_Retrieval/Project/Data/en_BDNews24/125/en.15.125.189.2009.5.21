"We are reviewing the policy to open the licence to WiMAX and International Gateway. It will take two to three months to finish," Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission chairman Zia Ahmed told a workshop. Reve Systems organised the workshop titled 'Technology Trends in IP Telephony'. "We want to give validity to the illegal business by reviewing the policy. I ask the people involved with the business to think about people's welfare," he said. "Many think VoIP (voice over internet protocol) should be allowed. I agree with them." "But it requires a proper atmosphere." State minister for ICT Yafes Osman said: "We want to offer service. We believe in public-private partnership." "We are not here for policing."
