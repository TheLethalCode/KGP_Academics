 CANBERRA, Fri May 22, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Authorities moved to evacuate thousands of people from a second Australian town Friday as floodwaters from days of torrential rain inundated large parts of the country's east coast. About 5,000 residents in Lismore, in northern New South Wales (NSW) state, were evacuated from their homes as floodwaters, in some places more than 10 meters (32 feet) deep, surged across riverlands stretching along 300 km (185 miles) of coastline.

Rivers burst banks at the towns of Murwillumbah, Tweed Heads and Grafton, although major coal-mining operations to the north and west in Queensland were unaffected. Prime Minister Kevin Rudd offered help to flood-hit areas. "It is critical residents follow the instructions of local authorities and as far as possible stay indoors and avoid the roads," Rudd said. Further south near Coffs Harbour, the Bellinger River was expected to peak at more than 8 meters, with more than 3,000 people isolated in the towns of Thora, Darkwood and Bellingen. In southeast Queensland, hundreds of roads remained cut on Friday, with homes flooded and industrial suburbs in popular tourist beach areas transformed into canals. While the rain had mostly moved south Friday, a massive clean-up operation in the state continued as beaches were swamped with huge waves and high t
