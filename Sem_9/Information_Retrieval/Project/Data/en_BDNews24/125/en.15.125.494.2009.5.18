<TITLE> Bangladesh played against monsters: hockey coach Rach </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 18 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh's German hockey coach Gerhard Peter Rach thinks the Bangladesh national hockey team will not improve much until the hockey federation wakes up from the slumber. After returning from the Asia Cup hockey campaign, Rach's evaluation was that Bangladesh played against monsters and the outcome would remain same until Bangladesh improve much. Bangladesh conceded 32 goals in four matches against Japan (5-0) Malaysia (7-1), Korea (9-0) and India (11-1) to finish seventh out of seven participants. At a press conference at the hockey federation on Monday, no one even coaches, players or BFF officials, took the responsibility of Bangladesh's humiliating defeat in the top-level hockey tournament in Asia. Rach said that they had played against monsters and the results of the Bangladesh national team would follow such outcomes until they themselves improved. "Bangladesh had lacked skill and experience of playing international matches and compared with those teams, Bangladesh are far behind to those countries in term of technical, power, and mental. "If we want to get closer to teams likes Japan and Malaysia, we have to improve much and the hockey federation has to wake up from the slumber," said Rach, who had coached the Indian hockey team. bd
