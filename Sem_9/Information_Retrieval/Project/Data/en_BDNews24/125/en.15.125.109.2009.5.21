<TITLE> Up to 200,000 Pakistanis stranded in Swat </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ISLAMABAD, May 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Up to 200,000 civilians have been stranded by a Pakistani army offensive against Taliban militants in the Swat valley and authorities might have to drop food to them from the air, a relief official said on Thursday. The army launched an offensive this month in the Swat and neighbouring districts, northwest of Islamabad, to stop the spread of a Taliban insurgency that had raised fears for nuclear-armed Pakistan's future. About 1.5 million people have fled the fighting -- joining about 555,000 displaced by earlier clashes in the northwest -- and an international humanitarian operation is underway to help them. Many civilians, however, have remained in the valley, which has been under curfew since the offensive began on May 8 apart from a couple of breaks to let people get out. "It's safe to assume it could be up to 200,000, especially in northern Swat," Lieutenant-General Nadeem Ahmed, head of the government relief operation, told Reuters in an interview. "That's the only area where there is some difficulty. The rest of the area has been now reached and the humanitarian community is operating there," he said. The military has launced a three-pronged attack in the valley and soldiers are closing in on its main town, Mingora, where the Taliban have dug in and laid land mines. Ahmed said "not many" civilians were left in Mingora, with most people still in the valley in its northern reaches, which has been "relatively calm". For now, authorities want people stranded there to stay put, rather than risk travelling through the war zone in and around Mingora to the south, even though they might be running out of food. "Saying that they have sufficient food would not be appropriate," Ahmed said when asked about the civilians' supplies. "There have been reports that, given a chance, they would like to come out, but since this area has not seen active operations, therefore we think it's best if we try and sustain them right there." "Should there be a need, we're also prepared to do some aerial drops in certain areas, subject to the fact that they are safe landing places," he said. "REMAIN PREPARED" The battle for Swat had almost entered its final stages and some people had begun returning to areas where peace had been restored, he said. "Hopefully, things will improve and we should be able to send much larger relief convoys to the north," he said, adding the aid will not stop when the guns fall silent. "You have to support this population," he said. "They have lost their crops so they need to be sustained. As far as humanitarian action is concerned, it will go right up to the end of the year." Pakistan's allies promised $224 million in aid for the displaced after the government warned that the militants could exploit a failure to help. The United Nations is due to launch a "flash appeal" on Friday aiming for up to $600 million. President Asif Ali Zardari has said Swat was just the beginning, and the army would next move against militants in the Waziristan region on the Afghan border. Fearing war, about 2,500 civilians have left South Waziristan in recent days, Ahmed said. "We'll have to just see how the situation develops. God forbid, if something happens the humanitarian world will have to remain prepared," he said.
