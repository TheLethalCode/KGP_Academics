<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 21 (bdnews24.com)The government is working on how farmers can sell their produces at fair price, the finance minister said on Wednesday, amid concerns after the fall in rice and paddy prices. "Farmers are being given incentives in many ways to grow their produces. Different steps have been taken to set the right prices for agricultural produces, including paddy," A M A Muhith said at a pre-budget discussion, organised by private television channel NTV and FBCCI at Sonargaon Hotel. A cross-section of people, including businessmen and farmers from Chittagong and Dhamrai, participated in the discussion through teleconference. "Because there is a lack of administrative efficiency, it cannot be said that everything is being done properly," he said, on an observation made by Shykh Siraj, who works on ensuring fair price for farmers. Farmers cannot sell their produces at the price the government has fixed, Siraj pointed out. He suggested a cut in price of agriculture equipment to reduce the price of food grains. Muhith said, it cannot be ensured that prices of commodities will not increase after budget. Pay and allowances of government officers and employees will increase in the new budget in line with the seventh pay commission's recommendations. "It will have impact on the market," the minister added. However, he said, it was possible to influence the market through reactivating the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh, he believed. "We are taking steps in that line." Pointing to the fact that bank credit assistance was essential to rural economic uplift, Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman said, "Currency and credit policies are going to be so recast as to benefit the farmers directly." "It has been reassuring to observe that alongside the government, private sector banks have also been disbursing sizeable agriculture loans." "Further steps envisaged to uplift our rural economy," the BB boss said, "will include introduction of special incentives to encourage the new entrepreneurs interested in imports." "Allocations in the SME sector are also being augmented soon." Dr Debapriya Bhattacharya recommended facilitating new importers to keeping commodity prices within reach of the most. "TCB interventions should never be replacing the expanded market across the country. The private sector must come forward too with similar motivations." To widen healthy competition among importers of certain commodities, Rahman said, "We have to create ways to encourage new importers." Former FBCCI president Salman F Rahman called upon the government authorities to resolve the natural gas mining and supply crises speedily. Economist Quazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmed endorsed augmenting the production of indigenous commodities and strengthening the TCB. Former caretaker government finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said, "During the caretaker overnment's tenure, prices of commodities in the domestic market rose and fell as they did so in the international market." Prices of essentials have fallen considerably as the government has regained the trust of the business communities, said commerce minister Faruq Khan. FBCCI president Annisul Haque moderated the discussion assembly. bdne
