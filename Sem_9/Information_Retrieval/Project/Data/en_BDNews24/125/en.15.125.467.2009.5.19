 Dhaka May 19 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka city Awami League general secretary and former state minister for shipping Mofazzal Hossain Chy Maya was in jail early Tuesday afternoon after a court said the graft convict would not be granted bail. A second ruling party man, Munshiganj AL chief Mohiuddin Ahmed, also landed in the Dhaka central jail minutes later on a similar court order. Maya, tried in absentia, was sentenced to 13 years in jail on Feb 14, 2008, by the special judge court-5 for hiding wealth information. He appeared before the same court more than 15 months later, and was greeted by a large number of party activists. Nurul Alam, an ACC assistant director, filed the case on June 13, 2007 with Sutrapur police station in Dhaka. Judge Mozammel Hossain also ordered the jail officials to accord the former minister first class benefits according to the prisons codes. A High Court bench had earlier directed 12 "VIP convicts" to turn themselves in to their respective trial courts first and then petition for bail. Accordingly, former communications minister Anwar Hossain Monju and former state minister barrister Shahjahan Omar surrendered on May 6 and former foreign minister M Morshed Khan on May 10. Rashiduzzaman Millat, ex-BNP MP, and former BMA secretary general Dr AZM Zahid Hossain also surrendered in the court. bdnew
