 New Delhi, May 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mayawati, the powerful leader of Bahujan Samaj Party representing the lower-castes, said on Tuesday her group would support a coalition led by the Congress party, further strengthening the stability of the new government. Mayawati, who is also chief minister of most populous Uttar Pradesh, said she had written to the President Pratibha Patil pledging the support of her party to the coalition. The Congress-led coalition won 262 parliamentary seats, just 10 short of a majority in the 545-member lower house of parliament in a general election. "Our 21 MPs will extend outside support to the UPA government," Mayawati said in a news conference in Lucknow.
