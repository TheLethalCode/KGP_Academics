 Dhaka, May 19 (bdnews24.com)Thailand has responded positively to a proposal on the resumption of on-arrival visa for Bangladeshi diplomats and civil servants, the foreign ministry says in a statement. While meeting her Thai counterpart Panich Vikitsreth at Bangkok airport on Sunday evening, foreign minister Dipu Moni also discussed the possibility of directly connecting the two countries by road and sea. The southeast Asian country stopped issuing on-arrival visas for public servants and diplomats in 1997. The Thai foreign minister met with Dipu Moni as she stopped in Bangkok airport on her way to London from Myanmar. "[Bangladesh] also requested Thailand to revive the on-arrival visa procedure for diplomatic and official passport holders of Bangladesh," said the statement on Tuesday. Three foreign ministry aides accompanied Dipu Moni. "They discussed issues such as bilateral trade and investment, upcoming 7th joint commission meeting between Bangladesh and Thailand, consular issues, connectivity through land and sea ports, promotion of tourism, Rohingya refugees and others," the statement added. Bangladesh and Thailand can only have direct road links if Myanmar agrees to give Bangladesh passage. Dhaka is funding the construction of a cross-country highway connecting 25-kilometre Bangladesh-Myanmar highway which can be stretched up to Kunming in China. The last meeting of the Bangladesh-Thailand joint commission took place in Bangkok in Nov 1999.
