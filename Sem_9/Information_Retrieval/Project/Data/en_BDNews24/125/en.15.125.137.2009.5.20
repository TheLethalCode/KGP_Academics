<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, May 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India said on Wednesday it has handed over new information to Pakistan relating to last November's Mumbai attack in which 166 people were killed. Pakistan had raised questions in response to a dossier of evidence furnished by India which pointed to the involvement of Pakistan-based militants. "Ministry of External Affairs have today handed over to the Pakistani High Commission additional information and details relating to the Mumbai terror attack sought by Pakistan," a foreign ministry statement said. It did not give any details. Local TV said the information included DNA samples of the attackers who New Delhi says were members of the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba group. The move by New Delhi comes days after a general election in India gave the ruling Congress party a strong mandate to deal with economic issues and security in a region overshadowed by instability in Pakistan and Afghanistan. The assault on India's financial capital raised tensions between nuclear rivals India and Pakistan, who have been to war three times since independence in 1947.
