<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 18 (bdnews24.com)The High Court on Monday ordered the government not to force opposition BNP chief Khaleda Zia out of her Dhaka Cantonment house until May 25. The court deferred to May 25 the hearing on the writ and supplementary petitions against an executive order asking Khaleda to vacate the house. The bench of justices Syed Refaat Ahmed and Moyeenul Islam Chowdhury in the order said the government cannot force the opposition leader out of the house until then. Any intervention or action against the ruling means violation of fundamental right of the petitioner in line with the articles 27, 31 and 42 of the constitution, the ruling said. "Nothing of this order will compel the applicant to bring any new incident, description and papers after May 25 to the court's file," the ruling said. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam asked the court after the order whether the government would be able to make any decision on the house following the ruling. The court replied that the government might do so only according to law. The bench started hearing the petition at 10:30am that continued through to 1pm. It resumed at 2pm. At the beginning of the hearing, Alam said a show-cause notice was served on the former prime minister on May 7, correcting an Apr. 20 notice. The applicant was given 15 days, which will end on May 22, after which the government will deliver the final order, he added. The attorney general applied for postponement of hearing on the petition until that time. T H Khan and barrister Moudud Ahmed argued for Khaleda. Khan said challenging the legality of the Apr 20 notice his client filed a writ petition on May 3. The High Court had postponed the hearing until May 10 on appeal from the attorney general, who had promised to the court that the government will not harass Khaleda until that time. Khan said despite the pledge the government served a supplementary notice on May 7. He said they feared that Khaleda may be evicted any time from the cantonment house. The attorney general said Khaleda's supplementary notice on the government which was submitted to the office of the attorney general did not bear the signature of the person who she nominated for filing it. In the first notice, Khaleda was asked to leave the house, but the second one asked her to show cause why she would not be ordered to leave the house within 15 days, Alam said. She was not intimidated with eviction from the house, he contended. The attorney general said as the government was yet to take a final decision, so the "immature" writ petition was not valid and should be quashed. Alam added that military property cannot be leased out to any civilian. A decision was taken on June 12, 1981 to give Khaleda a house and according to that decision, she was given a house in Gulshan. But despite knowing this she has taken the cantonment house. The court said she was asked to leave the house in the first notice. The attorney general replied the first notice was corrected by the second one. The court said the second notice seeking explanation from her should have been served prior to the first one. The attorney general replied that there was no example of issuance of rule on a show-cause notice. He added that now that Bangladesh was a democratic country, a house of the cantonment cannot be leased out to anyone. The court said that the applicant had accused the government of cheating with the court on the issue. The attorney general dismissed the charges. At this stage, Moudud Ahmed said the May 7 notice was final, because it said as the lease of the house had been cancelled, why Khaleda would not be ordered to leave the house. After the time for reply to the notice expired, she will be evicted without any further notice. Moudud said the second notice was served to correct the first "illegal" notice. As the first one was illegal, so was the second one, because one illegal notice cannot be legalised by serving another notice. He said a registered lease document cannot be cancelled without another registered document; it also cannot be cancelled on the basis of a notice. The second notice has been served to hinder the legal process. "If Khaleda is evicted from the house, where will she go?" Moudud asked. The cantonment house is the first house given to her; the government might say that it was not right to give her the second house, he said. Moudud said Khaleda had confirmed information that the government completed preparations to evict her. The attorney general shot back: "If the Bangabhaban is leased out to someone, then will it be a legal lease? "How is the house of the army chief leased out to a civilian? Will it be legal if the court premises is leased out to anyone?" The court on Sunday allowed Khaleda to file a supplementary petition contesting the government's second notice. Chief justice MM Ruhal Amin had constituted the bench on May 11 after a third bench felt embarrassed to hear the petition and a fourth bench declined to hear the plea from the former prime minister. The fourth bench of justices Md Anwarul Haque and Farah Mahbub said it was unable to hear the appeal because a judge of the two-strong bench had given his views on the house as a law ministry joint secretary. They referred the case to the chief justice for further orders. The former prime minister on Sunday night served a legal notice on the government to cancel the supplementary notice it had sent on May 7 within five days. On May 3, the bench of justices Ara and Hakim had admitted the petition and adjourned the hearing until Sunday on the attorney general's assurance that the government would not move in a week to evict the former prime minister. Earlier, the bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Quamrul Islam Siddiqui had felt embarrassed to hear the petition that sought a stay on the government order. Another bench, made of justices Tariqul Hakim and M Azizul Haque that had permitted the lawyers for the opposition leader to submit an affidavit prior to filing the writ appeal also felt embarrassed. Military lands and cantonments directorate served Khaleda the notice on April 20 asking her to vacate her cantonment house. In a modified notice on May 7, it asked the opposition BNP chief to leave the house within 15 days. The cabinet on April 8 cancelled the lease on the house on grounds that the leasing process had been faulty and that she violated lease terms. Khaleda responded to the government's first notice with a legal notice of her own on Apr 23. After murder of her husband, army chief-turned-president Zia, on May 30, 1981 during a military mutiny, his widow, Khaleda, was given another house in Gulshan in addition to the house in the cantonment the family had been living since the 1970s. The 2.72-acre mansion was originally the official home of the army chief, a position held by then Lt Gen Zia who then converted himself into a civilian head of state through martial law proclamations and controversial votes. Before the cabinet took the decision to cancel the lease, prime minister Sheikh Hasina said in parliament that she would ask the slain general's wife to vacate the house and that blocks of apartments would be built in the prime land for families of army officers killed in the Feb mutiny. bdnews24
