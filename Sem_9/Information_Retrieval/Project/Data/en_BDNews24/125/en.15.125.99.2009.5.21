The TVS Auto Bangladesh on Thursday signed Shakib for one year from May 15 to May 14, 2010 at the Hotel Sheraton and under the agreement Shakib will participate in all promotional campaigns to be launched by TVS Auto Bangladesh. "A TVS brand ambassador is a person who has personality as well as popularity and we have found both those qualities in Shakib," chief operating officer of TVS Auto Bangladesh Riaz Ahmed said during the signing ceremony. He also said that Shakib had achieved success in a short time through his brilliance and like him the TVS brand motorbikes also quickly occupied the market. Ahmed, without mentioning the amount Shakib will earn from the deal, said the Bangladesh brand ambassador will get a certain amount of money. However, it was learnt a source close to Shakib that the all-rounder would get Tk 10 lakh for one year. Ahmed also said that the company also plans to appoint another one or two brand ambassadors from Bangladesh. Sachin Tendulkar was also a TVS brand ambassador and currently Indian skipper Mahendra Singh Dhodi is one too.
