 Dhaka, May 21 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission has no proposal on its table on the merger of mobile-phone operators Banglalink and AKTEL "We have not got any such proposal yet. There is no bar here (to merge Banglalink with AKTEL) if the subscribers do not face any problem," the telecoms watchdog chairman Zia Ahmed told bdnews24.com on Thursday. Many international media reported on Tuesday that the two cell-phone vendors were mulling over working jointly in a bid to make profit in their business and save them from ongoing loss.

Sawiris told the media that they were in discussions to combine their operation with Malaysia-based TM International that owns AKTEL to sustain in the Bangladeshi market. He said it was not possible for six mobile vendors to make profit in a small market in Bangladesh. Reached, top officials of Banglalink and AKTEL in Dhaka told bdnews24.com they were unaware of the developments.
