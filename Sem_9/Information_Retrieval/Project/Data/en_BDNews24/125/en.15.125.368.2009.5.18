<TITLE> Former Bangladesh skipper Bashar to quit ICL </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar has agreed to quit the unofficial Indian Cricket League (ICL) by accepting an amnesty from the national board, a board spokesman said on Monday. (adds Bashar quote) "Bashar served a notice on ICL expressing his desire to terminate his contract. He informed us through a letter on Sunday," Jalal Yunus, Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) media spokesman said. The International Cricket Council (ICC) last month rejected the league's application for recognition. Bangladesh slapped a 10-year ban on 14 players after they joined ICL last year with Bashar named to lead a newly formed Dhaka Warriors team. The BCB offered a reprieve this month, asking players to terminate contracts with the league by June 15 to have their bans lifted. However, the board has said they would not be eligible for national selection until next year. Bashar, who has played 50 tests and 111 one-dayers for the youngest test team, told a news conference on Monday that he had decided to return as it had been painful to be away from mainstream cricket. "Over the last seven to eight months, I have realised that I lost more than what I gained by joining ICL. People used to respect me as a former national captain, but when I joined ICL, it changed," the 36-year-old said. "Being a banned cricketer, I always felt embarrassed when I mingled with people. I was looking for an opportunity to return and I am thankful that the Board gave it to me. It's a great relief for me now.
