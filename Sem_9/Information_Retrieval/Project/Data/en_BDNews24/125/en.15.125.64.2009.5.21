 NEW DELHI, May 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A major ally of the Congress party will leave the ruling coalition due to disagreements over ministerial appointments, potentially weakening the new government's ability to pass bills in parliament. The DMK party from Tamil Nadu said it would only offer its 18 lawmakers as outside support to the coalition in parliament, a senior party official said on Thursday. The move, which comes days after the coalition led by Congress, will almost certainly not deprive the alliance of a majority in parliament. "Karunanidhi has asked me to inform you that DMK will support from outside," T.R. Baalu, a senior leader said, referring to a directive from the DMK leader. The DMK's move came as the Congress party was cobbling together a coalition of parties on the eve of the swearing-in of Prime Minister-elect Manmohan Singh on Friday. The coalition said it had the support of 274 lawmakers before the DMK exit, two more than needed for a parliamentary majority. With outside support, the coalition said it had 322 members of the lower house of parliament. Analysts said it may be political posturing amid negotiations over ministerial portfolios and noted that the DMK made the same move after the 2004 election, before eventually joining the ruling alliance. "The Congress does not have to bother about them. It is only a threat and they will finally come around. They (the DMK) also are aware that the Congress party does not need to bother about them," said political commentator Kuldip Nayar. "They (the Congress) have enough seats on their own and they can get others." A Congress official said negotiations with the DMK were still carrying on. Indian financial markets have surged on hopes that the ruling coalition's strengthened mandate would allow Singh to pursue reforms at a time when growth in Asia's third-largest economy has hit a six-year low of 6.5 percent.
