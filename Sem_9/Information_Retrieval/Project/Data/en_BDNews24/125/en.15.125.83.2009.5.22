 YANGON, Fri May 22, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Myanmar said on Friday a US citizen who sneaked into detained opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi's home may be part of a plot by "anti-government elements" to intensify international pressure on the military regime. Foreign Minister Nyan Win said the trial, denounced by critics as a ploy to keep the 63-year-old Nobel Peace laureate in detention until after 2010 elections, "will proceed fairly according to the law," state media reported. Suu Kyi faces up to five years in jail if found guilty of breaking the terms of her house arrest by allowing the American, John Yettaw, to stay for two days. Her lawyers deny the charges, saying Yettaw was not invited. He is also on trial, charged with violating a draconian security law after he used home-made flippers and improvised plastic floats to swim to Suu Kyi's home on May 4. Yettaw told the court this week he had a vision Suu Kyi's life was in danger and wanted to alert her and the Myanmar authorities, one of her defense lawyers said. Foreign Minister Nyan Win said the incident was probably "trumped up to intensify international pressure on Myanmar" at a time when the United States, Japan and some European countries were reviewing their policies toward the former Burma. The United States has renewed sanctions against the regime while it conducts its review. The European Union has threatened tougher measures since Suu Kyi was charged a week ago. Nyan Win blamed the incident on "internal and external anti-government elements who do not wish to see the positive changes in those countries' policies toward Myanmar," the New Light of Myanmar reported. The junta mouthpiece also published details of Thursday's hearing, which was closed again after diplomats and journalists were allowed inside the prison court on Wednesday in a rare concession from the regime. The court was shown pictures and video footage taken by the 53-year-old Yettaw inside Suu Kyi's home, where she has been a virtual prisoner for more than 13 of the past 19 years. Police Major Aung Htut Kyaw said the Canon camera seized from Yettaw contained 331 photos and one video file. They showed the flippers, different stages of using them, Yettaw in disguise, and the downstairs sitting room of Suu Kyi's home. On the video, Yettaw said he asked Suu Kyi's permission to take photos of her and upload them on the You Tube website. "He thought she refused because she was frightened," the newspaper said in its account of the hearing. Yettaw also swam to Suu Kyi's home on November 30 last year, but she declined to see him and reported him to the authorities. Yettaw said he believed that visit caused her "a lot of trouble." Suu Kyi's lawyers say she did not report Yettaw this time because she did not want him to run afoul of the junta. On the video, the Missouri resident said he had left his family behind, "believed God was with him" and admired Suu Kyi and "did not blame her for not allowing him to take her photos." It is unclear when the trial will end. The prosecution was halfway through its list of 22 witnesses, most police officials, when Thursday's hearing ended. Most Myanmar watchers say Suu Kyi is almost certain to face a guilty verdict, which could come before her latest spell of house arrest is due to expire on May 27 after six y
