 Dhaka May 20 (bdnews24.com) A Dhaka court on Wednesday sent to jail corruption convict Safiur Rahman Babu, the younger son of former finance minister Saifur Rahman, after he surrendered. Judge Jasmine Anwar of Dhaka Special Judge's Court refused him bail after he turned himself in to the court that had sentenced him to 13 years in jail on Jan 26 on charges of amassing illegal wealth and concealing wealth information. The judge, who had also ordered confiscation of the ill-gotten assets in that verdict, on Wednesday turned down his appeal for bail. According to case details, Safiur amassed Tk 14 crore beyond his known sources of income and concealed assets to the tune of Tk 1.22 crore from the anti-graft watchdog. The fugitive Safiur faces 10 years and a Tk 10 lakh fine for amassing the illegal assets and the remaining three years and a Tk 5 lakh fine for concealing information in his wealth statement. The two sentences will run consecutively from the time of his arrest or surrender, and Safiur faces another two and a half years behind bars on failure to pay the fines. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case on April 29 last year with Ramna Police Station. A High Court bench had earlier directed 12 "VIP convicts" to turn themselves in to their respective trial courts first and then petition for bail. Accordingly, former communications minister Anwar Hossain Monju and former state minister barrister Shahjahan Omar surrendered on May 6 and former foreign minister M Morshed Khan on May 10.
