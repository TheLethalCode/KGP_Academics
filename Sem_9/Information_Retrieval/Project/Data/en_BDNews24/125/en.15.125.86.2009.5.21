 Dhaka, May 21 (bdnews24.com)Bangabandhu National Stadium will host none of the matches of the World Cup Cricket 2011, though it will stage the opening ceremony. Bangladesh will host eight matches including two quarter-finals at two different venues. "The football turf will be damaged if cricket is played at this stadium because it was allocated for football," state minister for sport Ahad Ali Sarkar said after a meeting on Thursday on the preparation for the World Cup. The damage will amount to around Tk 10 crore, he said. The matches will be held at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur and Narayanganj Osmani Stadium, Fatullah. Besides, the stadiums in Khulna and Chittagong are being prepared as alternative venues. Bangladesh Cricket Board will apply to the International Cricket Council for arranging a match at Chittagong as the third venue, the junior minister said. The home ministry will make security arrangements for biggest cricket extravaganza. On-arrival visas will be arranged for foreigners coming to watch the matches, Sarkar said. There are plans for multiple visas, but the decision will be taken after discussing with other co-organisers India and Sri Lanka, said the minister. The government has decided on duty-free import of camera and machine parts, he said. Five matches including a quarter-final were allotted for Bangladesh at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium, but Bangladesh got three more matches including a quarter-final and have to choose another venue for extra matches. The ICC had to decide on the redistribution of Pakistan's 14 matches after it removed the country from the list of hosts because the "uncertain political situation" would have made it difficult to "deliver a safe, secure and successful event" in Pakistan. bdne
