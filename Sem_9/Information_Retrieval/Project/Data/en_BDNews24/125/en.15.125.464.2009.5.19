 Dhaka, May 19 (bdnews24.com) Bangladesh Biman clinched the Public University and Services Cricket Tournament title after a comprehensive six-wicket win over Jahangirnagar University on Tuesday. Biman raced to 116-4 in 24.4 overs in reply to Jahangirnagar's poor total of 111 in 38.3 overs in the final at the Dhanmondi Cricket Stadium. Biman, studded with first-class cricketers, began the chase badly losing the wickets of openers Ali Faiyaz (4) and Elias Sunny (8) and Javed Omar (4) for just 22 runs inside eight overs. Experienced campaigners Tushar Imran and Mushfiqur Rahman, however, eased the pressure contributing 59 runs for the fourth wicket before Tushar fell to Farid for 34, leaving the national flag-carrier at 81-4 in 17.2 overs. Mushfiqur along with Sanwar Hossain added another 35 runs for the unbroken fifth wicket to steer Biman home. Mushfiqur made an unbeaten 31 while Sanwar was 19 not out. Earlier, put in to bat, Jahangirnagar lost their first two wickets without a run on the board the situation got worse when two-down batsman Khaled Mosarraf fell to pacer Ashique to leave the side wobbling at 3-3 in 2.1 overs. Opener Shafiul Azam, however, stood tall with a patient 56 off 110 balls featuring six boundaries. He eventually was run out by Rakibul Hasan and by that time his side were 92-7 in 35 overs. Hasanul Banna repaired the damage with a 57-run fourth wicket partnership with Shafiul. Banna made 21 off 63 balls.
