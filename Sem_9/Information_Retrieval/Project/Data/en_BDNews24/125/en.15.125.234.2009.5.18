 Dhaka, May 18 (bdnews24.com)The top BNP policymakers on Sunday discussed dissolving Dhaka and Chittagong district committees and replacing them with convening committees before adjourning the meeting for a second time. The national standing committee adjourned the meeting, presided over by party chief Khaleda Zia to decide on reorganisation of the main opposition party, until Monday evening. Her press secretary Maruf Kamal Khan told bdnews24.com the meeting, which began on Saturday and resumed at 7:30om Sunday evening at the BNP chairperson's Gulshan office, adjourned at the stroke of midnight. The party decided on Saturday to dissolve all district and approved the district convening committees of four divisions. "The new district convening committees will be assigned to organise council sessions at the districts, upazilas and unions," Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, a standing committee member, told reporters on Sunday noon. "Yesterday (Saturday) we accorded final approval to the district convening committees of four divisions. "Today (Sunday) the district convening committees of the remainder two divisionsDhaka and Chittagongwill be finalised." Mosharraf explained the district convening committee finalisation process. "Under the chairperson's leadership, the lists of the convening committees are being approved centrally through the standing committee nominating a convenor and a number of joint convenors." "The onus is now on the district convenors and the joint convenors to form the 51-member district committees." BNP plans to hold the national council by July and is carrying out its reorganisation activities, he said. "The Election Commission has given us this July deadline for holding the national council." "In case we cannot make it, we'll have to request the commission to extend the timeframe." Based on the six organising committees' reports and grassroots leaders' opinions, the party reorganisation process has kicked off. "We are considering this year as the year of our reorganisation. Through this process, the party will be strengthened by means of claiming popular confidence once again." The district convening committees now will dissolve the Upazila committees as soon as possible and hold a council session, Mosharraf said. Similarly, the Upazila committees should dissolve the union committees, form convening committees and new committees through election. The national council will be possible to hold as soon as the district councils are held, Hossain said. On a question, Mosharraf said, "BNP is a major political party and it boasts a large number of competent leaders." "So, there's no scope of defining the healthy competition among our leaders for posts and positions as rivalry or enmity. BNP has 75 units of organising districts, including six metropolises. After the devastating defeat of the party in the 2008 polls, the demands for reorganising BNP stemmed from the grassroots themselves. Khaleda acceded to that and declared on Feb 1 to reorganise the party afresh. From Feb 3 onwards, the party chief arranged for six divisional organising committees asking all the grassroots leaders to come up to Dhaka and interviewing them to form committees from the union up to the highest level through elections. After the interviews, the six divisional committees submitted their reports to the chairperson, which were reviewed by the national standing committee holding sessions for days together. b
