About 80 enterprises will participate in the fair organised by the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers and Commerce. President Zillur Rahman will attend the concluding ceremony.

First vice president of the FBCCI Abul Kashem Ahmed said, "The small and medium enterprises sector is now scattered. They could not forge unity. It would have been better if they could have organised the fair with support from the FBCCI". On May 27, the last day of the fair, seven will be given FBCCI-Standard Chartered Bank SME awards. Two seminars will be held focusing on SME development. FBCCI organised SME fairs in 2002, 2005 and 2006. bd
