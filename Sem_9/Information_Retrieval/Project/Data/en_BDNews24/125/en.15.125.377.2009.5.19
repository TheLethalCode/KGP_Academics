 Dhaka ,May 19 (bdnews24.com)The excerpts purported to be from the army investigation report on BDR mutiny ran by dailies are imaginary, commerce minister Faruq Khan, also the coordinator of probe committees, said on Tuesday. " I hope the national probe committee report on BDR mutiny will come to light in a few days," he told the reporters after the fifth meeting of high-powered committee formed to coordinate the tasks of different ministries following the Feb 25-26 carnage by border guards at their headquaters. The director general of BDR, major general Moinul Islam and director (operation) colonel Md Jahangir Kabir, were also attended the meeting held at the Darbar Hall of BDR headquarters at Peelkhana in the capital. If the army does not release the report or they send the same to the government and if the government does not release it, it amounts to no release, he said. "Moreover the report has not reached me. So the report excerpts published in different dailies is fabricated," he added. On general amnesty the government had declared for mutineers, he said, "The prime minister declared amnesty on February 25 but those involved in mutiny incidents after Feb 25 will not come under general amnesty." The director general of BDR major general Moinul Islam told the journalists that the mutineers outside Dhaka would not come under the mercy as most of the mutiny incidents at the different units took place on Feb 26. Besides, not all the 9000 BDR members who had been inside Peelkhana headquarters during the mutiny were involved in the bloodbath, he said On the reconstruction of border force, the minister said a set of 18 questions had been sent to different professionals including the former BDR chiefs, high officials of the armed forces, police, RAB and secretaries to ministries. They made recommendations on matters including organisational training, name and uniform, which were being reviewed, Khan said. Ten proposals on nameboth Bengali and Englishreached them, he added. There have been proposals for two sets of uniformsone for those who work at the offices and the other for those who guard the porous borders. Besides, they had received proposals on seven to eight logos, the coordinator said. The recommendations for reconstructing BDR would be sent to the government for approval after proper scrutiny. He said a total of 1,390 BDR members were arrested in Dhaka with 580 on remand until now, and 1581 border guards were arrested at different units outside Dhaka. Still, 25 BDR members were absconding and 93 firearms missing, Khan added. In reply to a query, he said investigation was going slow to find out the perpetrators and the causes. b
