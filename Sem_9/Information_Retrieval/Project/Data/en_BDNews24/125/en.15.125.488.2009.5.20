<TITLE> Govt flats for poor 'sold to rich at higher prices' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 20 (bdnews24.com) A property developer has allegedly sold off low-cost flats built under a government scheme for low-income people and slum dwellers to the rich at higher prices. North South Property Development Limited is the real estate firm that is implementing the Tk 500 crore scheme. Officials say many flats were sold before a list of those who should get the flats were filed to the land ministry. The flat owners were not provided all facilities according to the terms and conditions laid down by the government. The land ministry directed the authorities to look into the matter after commerce minister Faruq Khan had alleged the irregularities in a letter to the ministry. Project director Punyabrata Chowdhury, also deputy land secretary, told bdnews24.com that NSPDL chairman Abdur Rahim had submitted two lists of 1,250 aspirants to the ministry. The flats would be allocated to the real slum dwellers and the low-income people after the two lists were screened, Chowdhury said. He also admitted that one list named the people who had submitted the money fixed by the government and the other who paid more than the government-fixed flat price. Land minister Rezaul Karim told bdnews24.com Monday that they would examine irregularities in flat allocation and take steps accordingly. "We will not allow any corruption," the minister said. Rahim, the chairman of the NSPDL, declined comments until he received any letter from the ministry. The project was initiated in 2003 after eviction of the Bhashantek slum. The NSPDL was awarded the project on Sept 29 the same year to construct flats on the government land. According to the agreement, the company set the price of 215 square feet type 'A' flat () for slum dwellers at maximum Tk 2 lakh, payable in 10 yearly instalments. The people in low-income bracket will get 395 square feet type B flat at Tk 3.55 lakh, payable in four yearly instalments or in one go. But, the NSPDL hiked the price of B type flats to Tk 3.90 lakh and applied for sale of forms on Apr 13, 2004 without being in agreement with the government. It was asked to start selling form only after approval of the revised project proposal by the government, finalisation and approval of flat allocation regulations and receipt of revised master plan from RAJUK and approval of design. But without fulfilling the conditions the NSPDL started selling forms through five banks, prompting the ministry to ask the banks to stop the sale. The ministry on Aug 31, 2004 warned the company in a notice advertised in three dailies as the developer continued with the sale. The firm then took the government to the court. The court ordered the government to stop publishing warning notice and not to bar it from project work for the next three months after the ruling. The time was extended to one and a half years in two phases. A higher court on May 6 this year dismissed the appeal of the firm. The ministry officials said the company sold off the flats to the higher-income people at a higher price taking advantage of the previous court ruling. It made hefty profits, dealing a severe blow to the very aim of the government. Advocate Manzil Morshed, lawyer for the land ministry, told bdnews24.com that the court ruling had proved that NSPDL had committed huge corruption and irregularities in the project. The land ministry now can take any measure against the company and cancel the agreement, he observed. bdne
