<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 18 (bdnews24.com)The government has finalised a draft policy on leasing Jalmohal, or submerged land, to 'real' fishermen and their cooperative society, the land minister said on Monday. The committee on government Jalmohal management gave the approval to the policy at a meeting at the ministry, Mohammad Rezaul Karim Hira told reporters. The new draft policy may be put before next cabinet meeting for final nod, he also said. According to existing policy, Jolmohal are allocated through tenders invited in line with Government Jolmohal Leasing System-2005, he said. The highest bidding person or institution gets Jalmohal through this system that allows many people or associations to enjoy Jalmohal lease for long. The system defeats the main aim of leasing Jolmohal as it bars the landless and the poor fishermen from getting lease, Hira pointed out. The government now has decided to form three committees by repealing tendering process to detect actual fishermen and associations to lease Jolmohal, he said. The people or associations living next to Jolmohal will be considered for leasing, he said and added that lease will be for a maximum of three years. According to the new policy, the land minister will head the central Jolmohal management committee, deputy commissioners will head district Jolmohal management committees and Upazilla Nirbahi officers the Upazilla Jolmohal management committees. Local MPs will be advisors to the district committees and local MPs and Upazila chairmen as advisers in the Upazilla committees. Among 28,879 lease-able Jolmohal many have already been leased out, he said and added the government was investigating into irregularities in leasing for action against the offenders. b
