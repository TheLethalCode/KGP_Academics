<TITLE> Obama's plan to close Guantanamo suffers setback </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 By Arshad Mahmud Washington, May 20 (bdnews24.com)President Obama was dealt a big blow on Wednesday after the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly rejected his plan to close the infamous Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba. In a 90-6 vote, the Senate, following in the footsteps of the House of Representatives, decided to not accede to Obama's request for $80 million required to shut down Guantanamo. What particularly shocked Obama and his senior aides was that the refusal came not only from the Republicans but also from a large number of Senators from his own Democratic party. Republicans have been raising alarm bells for weeks about the dire consequences of the president's planned Guantanamo closure. The Republican campaign has been so effective that many Americans appeared to have been terrified by the impending release of the Guantanamo inmates, many of whom are regarded as ruthless terrorists. Where will the detainees go? they've asked over and over. Will they be tried in the United States? And will former detainees, if cleared of the charges against them, be walking the U.S. streets? Democratic lawmakers, ostensibly for fear of losing political ground over the issue, decided to back down, rejecting Obama's request for money to start the base closure. "Democrats under no circumstances will move forward without a comprehensive, responsible plan from the president. We will never allow terrorists to be released into the United States," declared Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, at a press conference Tuesday after meeting with other Democratic senators. There are 240 detainees currently housed at Guantanamo. Of those, 80 are awaiting trial, two have been released in Europe in recent months, and 130 are in some sort of legal limbo. One of those detainees, top al Qaeda suspect Ahmed Ghailani, will be tried in New York City, an administration source told ABC News. Ghailani, who has been in custody since 2004 and has been at Guantanamo since 2006, was indicted in federal court in New York City for the bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa in 1998. Those attacks killed 224 people, including 12 Americans. Reid's words echo sentiments of Republicans, particularly Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has pressured Democrats for weeks on Guantanamo Bay. But while Reid ultimately wants to see the base closed, Republicans like McConnell see it as the perfect place to keep suspected terror detainees, many of whom have now been housed in Cuba for seven years. "In my view, these men are exactly where they belong: locked up in a safe and secure prison, and isolated many miles away from the American people," McConnell said on the Senate floor Tuesday. FBI Director Robert Mueller fueled the concerns sparked by Republicans. In testimony before a House panel Tuesday, Mueller said he could not get into specific discussions about releasing Guantanamo detainees into the United States, but he told the panel, "The concerns we have about individuals who may support terrorism being in the United States run from concerns about providing financing, radicalizing others. All of those are concerns." "There is a potential for radicalization in a number of ways, whether it be for gang activity, for terrorist groups, for other extremists," he said. Mueller used an analogy with gangs that pose threats in U.S. prisons and are able to recruit from within the prisons, saying, "There are individuals in our prisons today who operate gangs inside our prisons." Obama seemed to answer some of the concern among his party members about the detainees when he announced last week that he would re-instate a system of military tribunals originally enacted by former President Bush to try detainees by a military court
