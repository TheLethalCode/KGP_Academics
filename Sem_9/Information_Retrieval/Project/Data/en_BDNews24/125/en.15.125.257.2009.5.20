<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 20 (bdnews24.com) A parliamentary watchdog on local government could not finalise its recommendations on changes to a bill on city corporation because of diverse opinions among its members. Some MPs at Wednesday's meeting said the present Dhaka City Corporation area should be divided in two partsnorth and south. Some others proposed making hugely populated Gazipur and Narayanganj town into cities in addition to dividing Dhaka into two zones, Rahmat Ali, the committee chairman, told reporters after the meeting at parliament building. The Election Commission has been waiting for the passage of the city corporation bill to hold the long overdue Dhaka city polls. The standing committee, however, made final recommendations on the bill on Pourashabha or municipality, making the MPs ex-officio advisers to the local government bodies. "We have heard but not finalised the recommendations," Ali said and added the committee would continue the deliberations to make final recommendations. On recommendations on Pourashabha bill, Ali said, "We have inserted a provision making the MPs ex-officio advisers to the Pourashabha. But, unlike the Upazila act, the suggestions of the MPs will not be mandatory for the chief of local government bodies to follow. He said the committee also recommended creating posts of two deputy mayorsat least one for womanin the pourashbha bill set to be passed in the upcoming budget session. Parliament, when in session, will discuss the bill in the recommended form before its passage. The 2007-2007 military-installed caretaker government made two ordinances to change the city corporation and pourshabha acts which were presented in parliament for validation. The Awami League government in principle accepted the laws and placed those in parliament as new bills.
