<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 21 (bdnews24.com)  A scintillating century from L Thirimanne guided visiting Sri Lanka Development Squad to a massive 128-run win over GP-BCB National Cricket Academy at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Thursday. The hosts were skittled out for 178 in 39 overs after the visitors posted a challenging total of 306-5 in 50 overs. The GP-BCB side were reduced to 27-2 in 6.5 overs before opener Imtiaz Hossain and Marshal Ayub repaired the damage adding 49 runs for the third wicket. But the introduction of M Pushpakumara spelled trouble again as the bowler removed both Imtiaz (41) and Ayub (24) to trigger a middle order slump before the lower order produced some resistance with Muktar Ali making 35. Ranesh Perera, however, cleaned the tail with 4-42 while Pushpakumara returned 3-43. Opting to bat, Sri Lanka lost opener M Udawatta in the third over with scoreboard reading 11-1, but Kaushal Silva and L Thirimanne took the side to 99-2 in 19.1 overs before Nabil Samad trapped Silva leg before for 47. Thirimanne then added another 86 runs for the fourth wicket with A Priyanjan (46) before being bowled by Nasir Hossain, leaving the side at 261-5 in 46.1 overs. The opener made 124 off 129 balls that included 15 fours and two sixes. bd
