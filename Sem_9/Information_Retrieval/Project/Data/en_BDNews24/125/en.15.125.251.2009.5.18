<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 18 (bdnews24.com)The High Court on Monday deferred to May 25 the hearing on the writ and supplementary petitions against an executive order asking Khaleda Zia to vacate the cantonment house. The bench of justices Syed Refaat Ahmed and Moyeenul Islam Chowdhury in the order said the government cannot force the opposition leader out of the house until then. Any intervention or action against the ruling means violation of fundamental right of the petitioner in line with the articles 27, 31 and 42 of the constitution, the ruling said. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam asked the court after the order whether the government would be able to make any decision on the house following the ruling. The court replied that the government might do so only according to law. The bench started hearing the petition at 10:30am that continued through to 1pm. It resumed at 2pm. T H Khan and barrister Moudud Ahmed argued for Khaleda. The court on Sunday allowed Khaleda, the former prime minister, to file a supplementary petition contesting the government's second notice. Khaleda's lawyer Mahbubuddin Khokon said on Saturday, "A supplementary petition challenging the legality of the supplementary notice has been filed. The bench will hear both the writ petition and the supplementary petition on Monday." The supplementary petition said when Khaleda had filed writ petition on May 3, the court deferred the hearing to May 10 on the government's assurance that she would not be harassed until then. But, the government in a supplementary notice on May 7 asked the main opposition BNP chief to explain in 15 days why she should not return the estate, including the cantonment house. The petition challenged the legality of the government's first notice and said the second notice was also illegal on the same ground. The supplementary notice was sent to Khaleda only to persecute her and it contradicted the constitution and law, the petition said. Chief justice MM Ruhul Amin had constituted the bench on May 11 after a third bench felt embarrassed to hear the petition and a fourth bench declined to hear the plea from the former prime minister. The fourth bench of justices Md Anwarul Haque and Farah Mahbub said it was unable to hear the appeal because a judge of the two-strong bench had given his views on the house as a law ministry joint secretary. They referred the case to the chief justice for further orders. The former prime minister on Sunday night served a legal notice on the government to cancel the supplementary notice it had sent on May 7 within five days. On May 3, the bench of justices Ara and Hakim had admitted the petition and adjourned the hearing until Sunday on the attorney general's assurance that the government would not move in a week to evict the former prime minister. Earlier, the bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Quamrul Islam Siddiqui had felt embarrassed to hear the petition that sought a stay on the government order. Another bench, made of justices Tariqul Hakim and M Azizul Haque that had permitted the lawyers for the opposition leader to submit an affidavit prior to filing the writ appeal also felt embarrassed. Military lands and cantonments directorate served Khaleda the notice on April 20 asking her to vacate her cantonment house. In a modified notice on May 7, it asked the opposition BNP chief to leave the house within 15 days. The cabinet on April 8 cancelled the lease on the house on grounds that the leasing process had been faulty and that she violated lease terms. Khaleda responded to the government's first notice with a legal notice of her own on Apr 23. After murder of her husband, army chief-turned-president Zia, on May 30, 1981 during a military mutiny, his widow, Khaleda, was given another house in Gulshan in addition to the house in the cantonment the family had been living since the 1970s. The 2.72-acre mansion was originally the official home of the army chief, a position held by then Lt Gen Zia who then converted himself into a civilian head of state through martial law proclamations and controversial votes. Before the cabinet took the decision to cancel the lease, prime minister Sheikh Hasina said in parliament that she would ask the slain general's wife to vacate the house and that blocks of apartments would be built in the prime land for families of army officers killed in the Feb mutiny. bdne
