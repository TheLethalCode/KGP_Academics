 Dhaka, May 21 (bdnews24.com)  Jamaat-e-Islami leader Delwar Hossain Saeedi has filed a libel suit against three lawyers seeking Tk 100 crore in damages for filing a civil suit against him and 35 others last year. They had sought court orders declaring them 'war criminals' and barring them from running elections. The former Jamaat MP filed the suit with the Dhaka Judge's Court-3 on Thursday. Judge SM Saiful Islam set June 17 for the defendants to appear in the court. Advocates Liton Mia, Safayet Hossain Sajib and Rajib Ahmed filed the petition with Dhaka Ninth Additional District Judge's Court on Nov 13, 2008, a month before the general elections. The court on May 11 served summons on Saeedi, former Jamaat-e-Islami chief Golam Azam, incumbent chief Matiur Rahman Nizami, secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammed Mojaheed, BNP leader Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury and 31 others to appear in court on July 20. The court on May 13 withdrew the order following the appeal of the lawyers. The 36 were to explain why they should not be declared "war criminals" for the crimes they had committed during Bangladesh's war of independence from Pakistan in 1971. . The chief election commissioner, Election Commission secretary and Dhaka deputy commissioner were also made defendants in the case. The complaint added they had also killed scores of intellectuals on Dec 14, 1971, two days before the final victory.
