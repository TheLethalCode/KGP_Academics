 Goalundo, May 19 (bdnews24.com) The chief election commissioner has said the Election Commission plans to hold the municipal and Union Parishad elections in November and December. All election and national ID related activities required to stage the local government vote may be completed by splitting the country into 10 zones and setting up a server station in each Upazila, ATM Shamsul Huda told reporters on Tuesday. Travelling by road from Dhaka, the CEC inspected the proposed venue for the server station at Goalundo Upazila Parishad compound. The EC had initially thought that the elections might be held in June, but the ordinance made by the caretaker government for the purpose has not been passed by the parliament, he said. It led to the restoration and enforcement of the old law, Huda added. Neither the EC nor the government would like to hold elections under the old law, he said. That is why, the proposals for certain reforms such as barring the same person from contesting for more than one positions have been made, the election chief added. Rajbarhi deputy commissioner Fayez ahmed, Dhaka division deputy election commissioner Lutfar Rahman and Upazila Nirbahi Officer Md Nasir Uddin accompanied the chief election commissioner. He saw the proposed sites for Rajbarhi district headquarters, Pangsha and Baliakandi server stations and visited three more sites in Faridpur district in the afternoon. bdn
