 RAMALLAH, West Bank, Tue May 19, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Western-backed technocrat Salam Fayyad will stay on as prime minister of the Palestinian Authority at the head of a new cabinet to be announced shortly, Palestinian officials said on Tuesday. They said Fayyad, a former World Bank economist, would maintain effective control of security and finance in the new government, the key portfolios in the administration headed by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, although members of Abbas's Fatah faction will replace political independents in some posts. "The list is ready and the swearing in will take place today at 6 p.m. (1500 GMT)," said one official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Members of Fatah will control nearly half of the two dozen cabinet seats in the new line-up, the officials said, meeting the group's demand for a greater say in running the Palestinian territories. They had been excluded from the cabinet since Abbas appointed Fayyad in June 2007 in the wake of civil war in Gaza. The Palestinian Authority in effect now administers only the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where some 2.5 million Palestinians live. The Gaza Strip, home to 1.5 million Palestinians and blockaded by Israel, has since June 2007 been under the control of the rival Hamas group, an Islamist movement which unlike Fatah opposes making peace with Israel. Formation of the new government goes some way to reinforcing the authority of Abbas 10 days before he is due to meet U.S. President Barack Obama. Abbas had postponed swearing in a new government last week owing to disagreements on the line-up -- between Fayyad and Fatah members, within Fatah and between Abbas and members of his own faction. Hamas, in control of Gaza since they routed Abbas's forces in 2007, consider Fayyad's administration as "illegal" and insist that Abbas's term actually ended months ago. The cabinet lineup was agreed one day after a fresh round of reconciliation talks between the rival Palestinian factions ended in stalemate in Cairo. The Egyptian-mediated negotiation has been going on for months without showing concrete results. The Palestinians' internal rift has seriously undermined prospects for resuming stalled peace talks with Israel, which says it can only negotiate with one Palestinian leadership and will not negotiate with Hamas -- unless it drops its commitment to armed resistance and agrees to reconise the Jewish state. Hamas won a parliamentary election in January 2006, ending a near-monopoly on power by the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) and its dominant faction, Fatah. The government Hamas formed was subject to a crippling boycott by Western aid donors, leading to a unity government between Hamas and Fatah in 2007. That lasted only a few months before the violence in Gaza resulted in a rift between the two Palestinian territo
