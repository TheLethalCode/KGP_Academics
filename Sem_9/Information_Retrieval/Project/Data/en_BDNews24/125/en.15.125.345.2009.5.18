 LONDON, Mon May 18, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The most senior official in Britain's lower house of parliament apologized on Monday for an expenses scandal among lawmakers that has prompted growing calls for an early general election. "Please allow me to say to the men and women of the United Kingdom that we have let you down very badly indeed," said Speaker Michael Martin. Sidestepping calls to step down over his handling of the crisis, Martin said he would meet party leaders within the next 48 hours to discuss reforms to an allowances system which has seen lawmakers claim for everything from biscuits to cleaning work on their swimming pools.

Cameron stole a march on Brown by cracking down on abuses in his own party. Brown has put his faith in slow-moving parliamentary reforms. Speaking at a campaign launch in northern England, Cameron said he was launching a drive for a general election, the second leader of a major party to follow this route. "We are turning the campaign we had planned for these elections into the campaign Britain now needs: a campaign for a general election, to be held as soon as possible after the 4th of June," he said. "From tomorrow I want Conservative candidates and activists right across the country to start collecting signatures for a petition demanding that Gordon Brown calls a general elect
