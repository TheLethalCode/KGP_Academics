<TITLE> Suicide bomber kills three in northern Iraq: army </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Kirkuk, Iraq, May 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed at least three people and wounded seven others in the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk on Thursday, and the death toll from Wednesday's car bomb in Baghdad rose to 40. The Kirkuk bomber struck Sunni anti-Qaeda militia members queuing to collect their pay, the army said. A police source gave a higher death toll of five. The blast came hours after a car bomb killed 40 civilians and wounded 82 others in northwest Baghdad's poor, mostly Shia district of Shula late on Wednesday. Police revised their earlier figures of 35 killed and 72 wounded. Hospital and U.S. military sources gave lower numbers. Sunni Arab state-backed militias, who have been credited with helping to dramatically cut attacks by al Qaeda and other Islamist groups, are frequently attacked by insurgents. Insurgents have been able to exploit ethnic and sectarian divisions to remain effective in some parts of Iraq despite the waning of their influence elsewhere. The oil-producing city of Kirkuk is disputed by Kurds, Arabs and Turkmen. Security has broadly improved in Iraq in the last year, but a rash of bombings in April made it the deadliest month for civilians since November. The recent attacks raise questions about whether Iraq can avoid sliding back into more bloodshed as its untested military prepares to take greater security responsibility and U.S. troops prepare for a full withdrawal by the end of 2011.
