<TITLE> Intruder had "vision" Suu Kyi in danger: lawyer </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 YANGON, May 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The American man at the center of the trial against Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi has said he swam to her house after having a vision that her life was in danger, Suu Kyi's lawyers said on Thursday. It is the first indication of Yettaw's motives for the stunt that could see Suu Kyi jailed for up to five years if she is found guilty of breaking the terms of her house arrest. Nyan Win, a spokesman for Suu Kyi's party and a member of her defense team, said Yettaw made the comment as the court heard testimony on Tuesday from a police officer who questioned him. "Do you remember that I told you at the interrogation that I had a vision that her life would be in danger?" Yettaw told his lawyer to ask the officer. The court refused to allow the question. "I had come to Myanmar to warn Myanmar authorities and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi against that danger," Nyan Win quoted Yettaw as saying. The 53-year-old American, who state media said used homemade flippers and flotation devices to swim to Suu Kyi's home on May 4, did not discuss his motives in a meeting with U.S. diplomats after his arrest. He is charged with immigration violations, trespassing into a restricted area and violating a security law protecting the state from "those desiring to cause subversive acts." Suu Kyi and two female assistants who also live in her home were charged under the same draconian security law a week ago. Her lawyers say she did not invite Yettaw and should not be held responsible for the actions of a troubled man. "OUTRAGEOUS" TRIAL Diplomats were again barred from the special court at Insein Central Prison on Thursday, a day after they were allowed inside in a rare concession to growing international outrage at the regime. "We are happy that the Myanmar authorities let our people see Daw Suu Kyi, but it's not the end," Thai Foreign Minister Kasit Piromya said in Bangkok. "Our main objective is the release of all political prisoners that will lead to national reconciliation," he said. Critics say the "scripted" trial is aimed at silencing the charismatic leader of the National League for Democracy (NLD) until after a multi-party election in the former Burma in 2010. Her current detention order expires on May 27 after a spell of six years. She appeared healthy and confident during the 45-minute hearing on Wednesday attended by 29 diplomats and 10 Burmese journalists. She said she hoped to see them "in better days." State-run MRTV broadcast footage of her talks after the hearing with diplomats from Thailand, Singapore and Russia. Singapore ambassador Robert Chua said she told them national reconciliation was still possible "if all parties so wished" and "it was not too late for something good to come out of this unfortunate incident." In Washington, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the upcoming election would be illegitimate because of the treatment of the charismatic leader of the National League for Democracy. "It is outrageous that they are trying her and that they continue to hold her because of her political popularity," Clinton told a congressional hearing. "It's our hope that this baseless trial will end with a quick release of her and ... a return to some political involvement, eventually, by her and her party," she added. Suu Kyi has been detained for more than 13 of the past 19 years, most of them at her home in Yangon, guarded by police, her mail intercepted and visitors restricted. Despite the tight security at her home, authorities say Yettaw, who according to media reports suffers from asthma, swam across Inya Lake and sneaked inside the compound. Police said Suu Kyi and her companions violated the terms of her house arrest by allowing him to stay there for two days. Her lawyers argue no law was broken because she did not invite Yettaw. They say she told him to leave, but he refused and Suu Kyi did not report him for fear he would get into trouble. At Wednesday's hearing, police captain Tin Zaw Tun said he had found several items left at Suu Kyi's home by Yettaw, who had first tried to meet her on November 30, when she refused to see him. The items included two black chadors, the robes worn by Muslim women in public, two black scarves, two long skirts, swimming goggles and some books, the captain said in a report by the state-owned New Light of Myanmar. "Asked why Mr. John William Yettaw left two chadors, she replied that he left them as gifts for her," the report said.
