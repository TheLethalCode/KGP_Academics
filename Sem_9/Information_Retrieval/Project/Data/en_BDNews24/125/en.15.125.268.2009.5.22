<TITLE> No mercy on mutineers outside Dhaka: BDR chief </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Rangpur, May 22 (bdnews24.com)No mercy will be shown to the border guards who mutinied at other battalion and sector headquarters after the Feb 25 rebellion at Peelkhana headquarters, the BDR director general has said. "They will not come under the aegis of amnesty," Major Gen Mainul Islam said on Friday while speaking to reporters at the BDR sector headquarters at Rangpur. He also dismissed media reports that the porous borders are unprotected. Those remained insecure from Feb 25 to 27, he said. Mutineers from different units created an unstable situation by communicating with the 'rogue elements' of Pilkhana, the BDR chief said. The paramilitary force had been purged of 'rogue elements' and the 'good elements' are being entrusted with work. All those involved have been arrested and put on trial, Gen Mainul added. "There will be no arrests anymore. We will have to work to restore the image of BDR by instilling confidence in BDR jawans." He ruled out assistance of India and Myanmar in reforming BDR. "It was reported in the media after I returned from India. It is not true. Nothing will be done against the interest of the country." The force is being overhauled and its uniform and logo changed, he added. Later, the BDR chief exchanged views with BDR jawans and high officials including BDR sector commander of Rangpur colonel Khairuzzaman. bdnews
