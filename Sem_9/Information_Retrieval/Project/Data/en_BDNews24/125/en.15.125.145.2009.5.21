 Dhaka, May 21 (bdnews24.com)The national enquiry committee filed the report on the Feb 25-26 BDR mutiny on Thursday. Committee chief M Anis-uz Zaman Khan along with other members submitted the report to home minister Sahara Khatun at around 4pm. They went there at around 3pm. "We've prepared the report objectively based on facts. We've performed the mammoth task despite various limitations," Anisuzzaman told reporters shortly after filing the report. He thanked the members of the committee for cooperation in preparing the report. After receiving the report, Sahara said, "The report will be published soon." The government formed the inquiry committee on Feb 26 headed by the home minister, but later reformed the committee with the retired civil servant amid calls for removal of ministers. The re-constituted committee, formed on Mar 2, began work the following day. The first deadline for its report, March 9, was extended by seven working days. On Mar 23, the committee got another four days. Finally on Mar 30, the committee was allowed 30 more workdays to submit the report for a proper investigation into the bloodbath at the border guards' headquarters ay Pilkhana in Dhaka that left at least 57 army officers killed. bdnews24.com
