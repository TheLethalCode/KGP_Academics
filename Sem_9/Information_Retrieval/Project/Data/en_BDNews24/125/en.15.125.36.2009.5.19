 Rajshahi, May 19 (bdnews24.com)Road communication between Rajshahi and the rest of the country remained suspended Tuesday as transport owners and workers had gone into strike since morning. The Rajshahi Road Transport Group said Monday that they wanted trial of those responsible for setting fire to a bus last week and were seeking damages. Angry locals, when a bus hit and killed two motorcycle riders at Paba on May 12, set fire to the bus. The bus owner later sued 13 people. The owners and workers demonstrated at many places including Shiroil bus stand, Palaimari crossing and Binodpur. They did not allow any movement of commercial buses through the terminal. Two double-decker buses tried and failed to enter the terminal. Police were on guard, patrolling the key spots. bdn
