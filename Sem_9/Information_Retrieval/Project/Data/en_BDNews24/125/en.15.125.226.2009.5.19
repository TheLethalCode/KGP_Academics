 Dhaka, May 19 (bdnews24.com)The prime minister is concerned about the quality of education, the chairman of University Grants Commission said on Tuesday. Sheikh Hasina urged the commission to take more care to improve the quality, Prof Nazrul Islam told reporters after a one-and-a-half-hour meeting with her at her office. He said the government was willing to pass the Private University Act, made by the 2007-2008 caretaker government, in parliament. Dhaka has 45 private universities and the commission is not going to allow more. Private universities will be allowed in divisional cities outside Dhaka, Islam added. The nearly 1,800 colleges under the National University might be brought under public universities since they have failed to maintain the quality expected of them, the UGC chief said while talking about restructuring the university. The prime minister expressed interest about utilising the Gazipur campus of National University for research and post-graduate studies, he said. bd
