 MOSCOW, Tue May 19, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States and Russia on Tuesday held talks aimed at cutting stockpiles of nuclear weapons, a move that could herald a thaw in relations between the former Cold War foes. US President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev last month agreed to pursue a deal on cutting nuclear weapons that would replace the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I), which expires in December.

Russia has said it wants to link the nuclear talks to US plans to deploy an anti-missile shield in Europe and has pushed for the United States to put a limit on the number of delivery systems -- the rockets or other means that deliver weapons. Washington and Moscow hope that if they can agree to a successor to START by December, this will strengthen their hand in pushing for an updated Non-Proliferation Treaty.
