 Dhaka, May 18 (bdnews24.com)  Rain ruined the warm-up match for the national players ahead of next month's ICC Twenty20 World Cup against visiting Maharashtra Cricket Association at the Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Monday. The second Twenty20 match was called off before the BCB XI, made up of national cricketers, started their innings after the visitors had been bundled out for just 83 in 15 overs. Off-spinner Naeem Islam's three-over spell claimed four scalps for just five runs. The third and final T20 will be held on Tuesday at the same venue. Opting to bat, Maharashtra got off to a fine start, adding 62 runs for the opening stand before Naeem wrecked the innings. Mahmudullah Riad began the rout dismissing opener Rohan Bhosale (16) and he was followed by Harshad Khadiwale, who fell to swing bowler Syed Rasel for a 30-ball 39 in the next over. The dismissal of both openers triggered a collapse and Maharashtra never recovered as no other batsmen except Rohan and Harshad managed to trouble the scorers. Rasel trapped one-down Ameye Srikhande in his next over after Ranjit was run out by Naeem Islam in the previous over and Naeem claimed his first wicket having Rohit Motwani for three, leaving the visitors tottering on 79-5. Maharashtra lost their remaining five wickets for just four runs with pacer Rubel Hossain and Naeem wrapping the innings. Rubel and Rasel took two wickets each for 17 and 18 respectively. bd
