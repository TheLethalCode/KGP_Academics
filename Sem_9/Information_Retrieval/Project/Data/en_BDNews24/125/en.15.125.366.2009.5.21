 May 21 (bdnews24.com)The government should discuss the proposal on BDR reconstruction including its name change in parliament before making a final decision, the BNP has said. "There is no need to change the name of a traditional organisation like BDR because of the mutiny," standing committee member Moudud Ahmed told the reporters a press briefing on Thursday. He said people were waiting for the probe reports on the Feb 25-26 mutiny at the border guards' Pilkhana headquarters in Dhaka that left 60 people including 57 army officers killed. The national investigation committee filed the report on rebellion to the government on Thursday. "We demand release of all three reports prepared by the government, CID and the army before public," he said. He opposed the move to change name of the paramilitary border force. "Mutiny took place also in the army, air force and Ansar but no organisation is to blame if any mutiny incident takes place," he argued. "Many dramas were staged also at the Bangabhaban but there was no change in the name of Bangabhaban," Moudud said "It was a part of deep-rooted conspiracy to weaken our army. So conspiracy must be unearthed through proper investigation," he said He said Party chairperson has been charged with forming Dhaka metropolitan convening committee. Six divisional supervising committees will be formed to oversee the activities of the convening committees. Apart from Dhaka metropolitan, other 74 district convening committees have been formed.
