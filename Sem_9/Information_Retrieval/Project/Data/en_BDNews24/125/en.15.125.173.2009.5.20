 Rohan Ziad bdnews24.com Business Correspondent Dhaka, May 20 (bdnews24.com)The government has made available Tk 10 crore to set up a capital market institute to develop skilled manpower for the stock markets and sensitise investors. The finance ministry allocated the fund on Sunday for the Bangladesh Institute of Capital Market (BICM), an official of the ministry told bdnews24.com, asking not to be named because he was not authorised to brief the media. The Securities and Exchange Commission chairman, Ziaul Haque Khondker, confirmed the news to bdnews24.com on Wednesday. He said that the process for setting up the institute may start as early as this July. "Since the government has acted fast on the matter, we also want to start it as soon as possible," added Khondker, who is the first investment banker to head the stock market watchdog. He said the SEC was on the lookout for a site for the institute, preferably at the Motijheel commercial district. The regulatory chief said the institute would work to supply a steady line of skilled manpower to the brokerage firms and run programmes to sensitise investors about the market and the dynamics. "As a result, betting money on rumours will come down, which will help to build a more efficient market," Khondker added. The BICM has already been registered with the office of the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms (ROC) as a not-for-profit organisation, according to the ROC website. The idea of a separate institute for the capital market was floated about three years back by the then SEC chief AB Mirza Azizul Islam, who went on to become the finance adviser to the 2007-2008 military-installed caretaker government.
