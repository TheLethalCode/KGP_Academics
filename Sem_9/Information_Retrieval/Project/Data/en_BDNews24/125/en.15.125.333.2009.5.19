 NEW YORK, Tue May 19, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Home Depot Inc reported higher-than-expected quarterly earnings as massive cost cuts offset weak sales, but its shares fell as investors found the results disappointing in comparison with those of smaller rival Lowe's Cos Inc. The world's largest home improvement chain, which has been upgrading service and products in its core retail business to win back market share as Lowe's expands, affirmed its fiscal-year outlook. On Monday, Lowe's reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings as it saw some strength in outdoor projects during the spring, even though consumers still kept away from major home renovations. Wall Street Strategies analyst Brian Sozzi said he was disappointed with Home Depot's results, noting that same-store sales were weaker there than at Lowe's.

Excluding items, the company earned 35 cents a share. Analysts on average were expecting 28 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales fell 9.7 percent to $16.2 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year, an important measure of retail performance, fell 10.2 percent. "Our markets, and the consumer in general, remain under pressure," Home Depot Chief Executive Frank Blake said in a statement. On Tuesday, the US Commerce Department said new housing starts and permits fell to record lows in April, denting hopes that the market was stabilizing. For the full year, Home Depot sees sales down 9 percent, with comparable-store sales falling at a high single-digit percentage rate. It expects earnings per share from continuing operations to decline 7 percent. Home Depot shares were down $1.34, or 5.2 percent, at $24.68 in morning New York Stock Exchange trading.
