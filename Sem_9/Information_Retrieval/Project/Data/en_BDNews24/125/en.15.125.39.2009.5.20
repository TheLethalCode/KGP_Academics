 Dhaka, May 20 (bdnews24.com)The parliamentary watchdog on finance ministry has again recommended continuing with the tax holiday facilities to generate more jobs, as the finance minister refuses to budge from his stance that the next budget will not offer the 'widely abused' benefits. On Tuesday, the chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on the ministry, A H M Mostafa Kamal, said the minister's announcement that there will be no more new tax holiday was "irresponsible". Finance minister A M A Muhith was not too impressed Kamal's comments the other day. "Whoever says whatever. I personally still believe there is no need to offer tax holiday," the minister told reporters on Wednesday after an inter-ministerial meeting on old-age allowance at the Secretariat. Apparently angry, he did not attend the standing committee meeting on Wednesday. Even, the finance secretary, Mohammad Tarek, skipped it. "Tax holiday facilities should cover priority sectors such as agro-based industries and information technology projects which attract low investments," Kamal told reporters later in the day after the meeting at parliament building. He said tax holiday facilities could be very useful for developing under-developed northern region. "If the government offers tax holiday facilities for setting up plants in north Bengal, investors will be encouraged to invest there and create more job opportunities," Lotus Kamal, as he is better known, said. The chairman enlarged on the panels recommendations. "In the first five years, the companies should enjoy tax holiday benefit providing a token 10 percent tax. In the next five years, the companies should pay regular tax. "In the third five-year period, they should pay up to 15 percent tax if they reinvest 50 percent of their profits." Kamal said the standing committee in the meeting discussed the budgetary framework and put forward recommendations on budget size, revenue collection and expenditure issues. "In Bangladesh budget size ranges between 15 percent and 17 percent of the gross domestic product and the next budget will be 16.5 per cent of the GDP," he said. The expected GDP size of the current fiscal is Tk 6,180 billion and next year's projected GDP size is Tk 6,860 billion, he added. The committee recommended that the National Board of Revenue expand its network to Upazilas and encourage rural people to pay taxes, said Kamal. The NBR should recruit more tax collectors to send tem to Upazilas and unions, he added. "There are many shops in unions and Upazilas and Tk 1,000 or Tk 2,000 per year in tax can be collected from each shop." The minimum taxable income ceiling should be raised to Tk 2 lakh from Tk 1.65 lakh, said a parliament secretariat press statement released after the meeting. Kamal said the government should lower the income tax rate and widen the tax base to collect more revenue.
