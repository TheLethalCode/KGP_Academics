<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 22 (bdnews24.com)BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia is scheduled to distribute food among the destitute at different locations in the city to commemorate the party founder Ziaur Rahman's 28th death anniversary on May 30. BNP's office secretary Rizvi Ahmed briefed reporters on Friday after attending a meeting of the national commemoration committee on the events. Kicking off a three-day chain of activities, on May 30 morning, BNP leaders and workers will lay flowers on Zia's grave at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar. The main opposition party will host a discussion meeting on the day at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh and a seminar on May 31 at Institution of Diploma Engineers. The national committee formed for observing Zia's death anniversary and headed by convenor MK Anwar, MP, discussed the related issues on Friday at the party's Naya Paltan office. The committee though decided that food will be distributed in every city ward on the occasion, but they have not yet identified the particular spots for such doling outs. In the meeting, Abdus Salam, former general secretary of BNP's metropolitan committee, proposed that the food distribution be executed by the city mayor and the ward commissioners. But the party's joint secretary general Mirza Abbas and Salahuddin Ahmed opposed the proposal. An exchange of unpleasant words followed, when it was decided that the chairperson herself would decide the matter. Aman Ullah Aman, BNP's organising secretary, Jatiyatabadi Krishak Dal president Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, Jatiyatabadi Jubo Dal president Barkat Ullah Bulu, MP, general secretary Syed Moazzem Hossain Allal, Fazlul Haque Milon, Khairul Kabir Khokon of Jubo Dal, Abdus Salam Azad and assistant publicity secretary Mohiuddin Khan Mohon were present in the meeting
