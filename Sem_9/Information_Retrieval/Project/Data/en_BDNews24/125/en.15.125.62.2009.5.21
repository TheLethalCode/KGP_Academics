 BUENOS AIRES, May 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Striker Gonzalo Bergessio scored twice to give Argentina, fielding an experimental team entirely of home-based players, a 3-1 win over Panama in a friendly on Wednesday. The game in the provincial capital of Santa Fe was Argentina's first since their 6-1 drubbing in Bolivia in a World Cup qualifier at high altitude in April. Huracan striker Matias De Federico put Argentina ahead after 27 minutes, curling a left-foot shot into the top corner from just inside the penalty area. But Nelson Barahona took advantage of slack Argentine marking to grab a shock equaliser for the visitors two minutes later. Bergessio, making his second appearance and one of the few Argentina players with any previous caps, restored the hosts' lead five minutes before halftime when he headed in De Federico's cross. The San Lorenzo striker completed the scoring six minutes from time with a left-foot shot after chesting down Rodolfo Montenegro's cross. "I was delighted with everyone," said Maradona, who is due to announce his squad on Friday for next month's World Cup qualifiers at home to Colombia and away to Ecuador. Following the embarrassing loss in Bolivia, Maradona may send an alternative team to Ecuador which is also at high altitude
