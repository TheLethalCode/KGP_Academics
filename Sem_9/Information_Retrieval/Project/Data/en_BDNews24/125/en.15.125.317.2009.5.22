 CENTURION, South Africa, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manish Pandey smashed the highest score of the Indian Premier League season as his unbeaten 114 helped Bangalore Royal Challengers to a 12-run win over Deccan Chargers and third place in the table. The Delhi Daredevils secured first place in the standings with a four-wicket victory over Mumbai Indians on the final day of round-robin action on Thursday. Pandey was called on to open the batting for the first time in the IPL and the 19-year-old smashed the ball all over Centurion in just the second century of the season. His 114 not out off 73 balls led Bangalore to 170 for four. Rudra Pratap Singh, who holds the Purple Cap for taking the most wickets in the competition, dropped Pandey on two and then bowled a terrible final over for Deccan, conceding 23 runs. Herschelle Gibbs ensured Deccan were initially up with the required run rate as he blasted 60 But spinner Balachandra Akhil, who had earlier winkled out Adam Gilchrist (15), dismissed the South African at the start of the 15th over with the help of a fine running catch by Pandey on the midwicket boundary. Akhil finished with two for 18 in four overs, while experienced leg-spinner Anil Kumble claimed two for 23 as Bangalore restricted Deccan to 158 for six. They will now play the second placed Chennai Super Kings in Saturday's semi-final in Johannesburg. Deccan ended fourth on 14 points, edging the Punjab Kings XI out of the semi-finals by virtue of a better run rate and will face Delhi Daredevils in the semis. Delhi continued to sweep all before them as they powered to their 10th victory of the round-robin stages, overwhelming the Mumbai Indians by four wickets with 15 balls to spare. Despite Mumbai off-spinner Harbhajan Singh claiming four for nine in two overs at the death, Delhi chased down a target of 166 with ease after Indian openers Gautam Gambhir (47) and Virender Sehwag (50) had terrorised the bowlers with a second-wicket stand of 68 off 48 balls. Sehwag's return to form heading into the semi-finals was particularly pleasing for Delhi and the captain teared into the bowling as he hammered five fours and two sixes in his half-century. Harbhajan claimed two wickets with successive deliveries in both the 15th and 17th overs, but it caused just a minor wobble in the Delhi innings. Delhi pacemen Dirk Nannes (three for 27), Aavishkar Salvi and Pradeep Sangwan had earlier bowled consistent four-over stints to restrict Mumbai to 165 for eight. But the spinners let Delhi down and Mumbai's favourite son, Sachin Tendulkar (46), and Ajinkya Rahane (56) scored freely in a stand of 73 off 57 balls for the fourth wicket, although it was to no avail in the end
