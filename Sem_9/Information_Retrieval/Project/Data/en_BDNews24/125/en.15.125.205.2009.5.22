 BERLIN, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Axed Bayern Munich coach Juergen Klinsmann has blamed the club's powerful chiefs and his former players for his failed 10-month stint at the German champions. "I hit the limits with my way of thought because I often had to deal with people who were unwilling to develop further. I wanted to take the next step," Klinsmann told stern TV on Wednesday. Former Germany coach Klinsmann was sacked last month after Bayern slumped out of the Champions League and the German Cup while failing to top the Bundesliga. He had raised eyebrows in his first club coaching job with new training and fitness methods and by bringing in his own staff of trainers and pledging to improve every player with every match. He said he had came up against club officials including President Franz Beckenbauer, manager Uli Hoeness and general manager Karl-Heinz Rummenigge who were all strong personalities. "They are all alpha males and also need their space. They are all personalities you have to work with." Klinsmann also blamed players for neglecting the Bundesliga in favour of Champions League glory. Bayern were eliminated in the quarter-finals by Barcelona. "They were very motivated for the Champions League. But there was lack of consistency (in the league). They thought the Bundesliga would run by itself. We dropped silly points." The 44-year-old said he should have asked for three or four signings. "It was a mistake to accept compromises because you are dealing with alpha males," he said. "One of the mistakes was to take over the squad that was given to me. I should have been clear from the start and say 'I need three or four players'. I allowed myself to be convinced." Bayern, who are in second place two points off the top with a match left to play, take on VfB Stuttgart on Saturday and need a slip-up by leaders Wolfsburg to clinch the title
