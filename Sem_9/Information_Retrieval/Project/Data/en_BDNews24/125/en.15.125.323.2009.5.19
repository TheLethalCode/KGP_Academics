 Dhaka, May 19 (bdnews24.com)BNP policymakers have decided on the new interim leadership of 74 political districts after days of deliberations led by chairperson Khaleda Zia, a standing committee member said Tuesday. "All the district convening committees except for the Dhaka city have been formed," Dr Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, the member, told bdnews24.com Tuesday. This meant, he said, the committees for all 75 political districts would stand dissolved and be replaced by the so-called "convening committees". For the 74 already finalised, a convenor and three joint convenors have been chosen. "The names of the convenors and joint convenors will be announced within this week," Hossain said. Amid bickering between such city stalwarts as mayor Sadeq Hossain Khoka and former mayor and minister Mirza Abbas, the top leaders will take some more time to decide who will lead the crucial Dhaka city unit, party insiders said. "The new district convening committees will be assigned to organise council sessions in the districts, upazilas and unions," said Hossain. "It will be the responsibility of the district convening committees to form the full 51-member district committees, through councils within three months." The National Standing Committee began the latest round of party revamping exercise on Saturday. "The Election Commission has given us time until this July to hold the national council. In case we cannot make it, we'll have to request the EC to extend the time frame," Hossain said. The former BNP minister said the standing committee work had been "based on the six organising committees' reports and grassroots leaders' opinions". "We are considering this year as the year of our party reorganisation." The district convening committees, he said, will now dissolve the Upazila committees as soon as possible and hold a council session. Similarly, the Upazila committees should dissolve the union committees, form interim convening committees and then new committees through election, he said. The national council will follow the council sessions at the district level, Hossain said. The party's grassroots led calls for reorganising the BNP after a crushing defeat in the Dec 29 elections in which it failed to win even a tenth of seats
