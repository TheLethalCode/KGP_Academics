 Chittagong, May 19 (bdnews24.com) Chittagong Ghat Gudam Sramik Union, a forum of storehouse workers, called off their wildcat strike on Tuesday night. The decision came after leaders of Chittagong city Awami League assured them of meeting their demands in 10 days, Union president Abdul Kader told bdnews24.com. "We will go for strike again if demands are not met within this time." Goods unloading and transportation had been suspended in 16 river ports of Chiittagong, after the workers went on a wildcat strike since Monday morning for a pay rise. Kader had said on Monday that a worker got Tk 7.20 for unloading a 90 kg sack in four steps from releasing the goods from lighter ships to truck. They wanted it hiked to Tk 10.
