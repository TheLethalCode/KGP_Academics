 Dhaka, May 17 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court on Sunday sent Islami Oikya Jote chairman Mufti Fazlul Haque Amini to jail after he had surrendered and prayed for bail in a mob attack case. Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Tofael Hasan refused Amini, who faces charges inciting a mob attack on a pro-Awami League rally, bail. The court also ordered IOJ's Md Kamal Uddin and Hafiz Md Badrul Islam to jail, Amini's lawyer Md Mahiuddin told bdnews24.com. Ruling Awami League's workers' front Jatiya Sramik League leader Akbar Hossain had filed the case on May 2 against Amini and nine others. In the complaint, Akbar said a procession of Sramik League that was returning from a May Day rally in Paltan Maidan in the capital was attacked at Islambagh by over 100 armed people under the orders of Amini and the other accused. The attackers hurled bombs and brickbats at the procession, the case statement said. During the hearing, lawyers for the accused said the case was false as none of the accused 'had been present' during the May 2 incident. bdnew
