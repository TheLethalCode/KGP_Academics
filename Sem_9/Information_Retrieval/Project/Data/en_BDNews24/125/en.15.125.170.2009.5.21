 Dhaka, May 21 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh should improve respiratory hygiene in order to prevent the pandemic swine flu as the total cases worldwide has crossed 10, 000, speakers said in a seminar on Thursday. James P Grant School of Public Health of BRAC university and ICDDR,B co-organised the seminar ' Swine Flu : Global and Local Perspective". Dr. Stephen P Luby, head of Programme for Infectious Disease and Vaccine Sciences Division (PIDVS), ICDDR,B, in an presentation asserted that the virus H1N1 can be transmitted through direct contact such as respiratory droplets with infected individuals. "In order to prevent any potential outbreak in Bangladesh, people must improve their respiratory hygiene  by sneezing into their elbows instead of into their hands or into the air, practice social distancing, wash hands often throughout the day with soap and water, and refrain from smoking as it impairs respiratory systems." He also stated the case fatality rates are comparable to that of the seasonal flu. He did note that the age of the patients affected by the H1N1 virus tend to be in their young adulthood. Dr. Be-Nazir Ahmed, associate professor and principal scientific officer at the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), gave an account of how the influenza virus has travelled from person to person in Mexico, United States, and Canada. In order to prevent any possible epidemic in Bangladesh, he suggested preventive measures such as screening at the ports by establishing 'health support desks' with special attention to Zia International Airport. Dr. Selina Khatun, national consultant (Training & Risk Communication) WHO, gave a presentation on WHO's strategy in preparing for any potential outbreak of the H1N1 virus in Bangladesh, ranging from communications, operations and logistics, vaccine task force, and anti-viral task force, among many others. The seminar was told that according to WHO until Wednesday, 41 countries have been officially reported with over 10,000 cases of swine flu. The government has already stockpiled the antiviral Oseltamivir capsules, manufactured by Beximco Pharma, in the districts and is in the process of buying more than 40,000 courses of antiviral capsules. As many as 20, 000 surgical musk has also been stockpiled.
