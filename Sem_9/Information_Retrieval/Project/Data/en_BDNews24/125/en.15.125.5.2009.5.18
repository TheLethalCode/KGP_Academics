 Mumbai, May 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The BSE Sensex extended gains to 17.24 percent on Monday, halting trade for the rest of the day after the surge triggered the final circuit breaker for the market. The 30-share BSE index rose 2,099.21 points to 14,272.63 points when trading resumed following a two-hour initial halt, after the ruling Congress-led alliance swept national elections and boosted investor confidence. The 50-share NSE index rose 17.3 percent to 4,308.05 points.
