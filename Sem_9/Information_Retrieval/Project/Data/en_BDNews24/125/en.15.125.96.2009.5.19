 CHESTER-LE-STREET, England, May 19(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England captain Andrew Strauss was keeping his feet firmly on the ground after his team ruthlessly completed a series win over West Indies on Monday. England won back the Wisden Trophy with ease but the task of regaining the Ashes this year from Ricky Ponting's Australians will be a lot tougher.

West Indies captain Chris Gayle was impressed by the way England bounced back from their series defeat in the Caribbean this year. "England are a quality team with quality players," he said.
