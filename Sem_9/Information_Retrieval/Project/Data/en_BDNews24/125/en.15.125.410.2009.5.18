 Colombo, May 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lankan troops fought to destroy the remnants of the Tamil Tigers on Monday, and recovered the bodies of top-ranked rebels including the leader's son, the military said. The fate of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) founder Vellupillai Prabhakaran still remained a mystery. Troops found what was thought to be the body of his son and heir-apparent, Charles Anthony, defence spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella said. The bodies of Tiger political wing head B. Nadesan and spokesman Seevaratnam Puleedevan were also found, he said. The remaining LTTE fighters were fighting from bunkers dug into less than half a square km (quarter-mile) of sandy land on the Indian Ocean island's northeastern coast, the military said. The LTTE could not be reached for comment and it was not possible to verify the military's assertions since the battlefront is closed to outside observers. President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who declared a military victory on Saturday even thought the last battle was raging, prorogued parliament, the required step for him to take the role of speaker and address the body. He was due to make his formal declaration of victory there on Tuesday. The LTTE conceded defeat on Sunday.
