 Jerusalem, May 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israel broke up an unauthorised settler outpost in the occupied West Bank on Thursday, hauling away seven metal containers converted to cabins, police said. There was no violence, a police spokesman said. The action was ordered a day after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu returned from talks with U.S. President Barack Obama, who urged a halt to construction of settlements in order to revive stalled peace talks. Defence Minister Ehud Barak on Wednesday warned that unauthorised outposts would be removed, by agreement or by force.
