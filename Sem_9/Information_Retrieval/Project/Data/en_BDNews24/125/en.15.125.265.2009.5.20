 New Delhi, May 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The army tested the nuclear-capable Agni missile on Tuesday, a defence ministry official said. The surface-to-surface Agni II missile is capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to targets around 2,000 km (1,200 miles) away, officials said. "It was a routine user trial carried out by the army which went off well," defence ministry spokesman Sitanshu Kar said. The 65 feet (20 meters) long missile can carry a payload of 1000 kg and its range can be increased to 3000 km (1,900 miles) by reducing the load. India's nuclear-armed rival Pakistan is also developing a range of missiles.
