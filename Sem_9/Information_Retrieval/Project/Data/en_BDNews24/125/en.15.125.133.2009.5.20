 Chittagong, May 20 (bdnews24.com)A Chittagong court on Wednesday gave CID police another six days to grill the two former NSI chiefs in custody in the sensational 10-truck arms haul case. The investigation officer of the case, CID SSP Moniruzzaman Chowdhury, produced retired major general Rezzaqul Haider Chowdhury and brigadier general Abdur Rahim in Chittagong Metropolitan Judicial Magistrate's Court at noon and appealed for 10-day remand. Metropolitan magistrate Osman Ghani, however, granted six days to quiz them in the taskforce interrogation cell. Earlier, the court had sent them on three days' remand which ended on Tuesday. The former chief did not divulge much information and parried questions tactfully, officials said. Rezzaqul was picked up Friday night from his residence at Old DOHS and Rahim, from his Dhanmandi home. They were subsequently taken to Chittagong CID office at Damparha on Saturday night. Rahim was serving as the chief of NSI while Rezzaqul Haidar as the director of Counter Intelligence Bureau of DGFI during the arms haul. Rahim, then a retired officer, was appointed to the top NSI job by the BNP-led coalition government. Gen Chowdhury succeeded him later and was removed immediately after the army intervened to impose emergency on Jan 11, 2007. Chowdhury was also sent into retirement from the army. Another accused in the case, NSI director, security, retired wing commander Shahabuddin Ahmad, in his confessional statement in the court on Friday that Rezzaqul and Rahim were involved in the scandalous arms haul. Shahbuddin was arrested on May 3 at his house in Dhaka on the basis of NSI field officer Akbar Hossain Khan's confession. On April 1, 2004 midnight, police had seized the 10 truckloads of arms smuggled in from the secured Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Limited jetty in Chittagong. Three former and one incumbent NSI officers have so far been rounded up. Habibur Rahman and Taslim Mallick, the proprietor and the manager of Greenways, a Chittagong-based truck company which had supplied the trucks for carrying the arms, volunteered information regarding the involvement of Akbar Khan. Based on the clue, police arrested Akbar first and following up on the clues given by Akbar, Shahabuddin was arrested. bdne
