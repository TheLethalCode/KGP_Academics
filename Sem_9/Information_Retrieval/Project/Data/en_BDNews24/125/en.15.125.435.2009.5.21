 TBILISI, May 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Georgian police shot dead a man suspected of playing a leading role in a mutiny at a tank base this month and wounded two others when they resisted arrest overnight, the Interior Ministry said on Thursday. The former military servicemen were accused of organizing a brief, bloodless mutiny at a base east of Tbilisi on May 5, which Georgia said was part of a Russian-backed bid to foment a wider rebellion against President Mikheil Saakashvili. Russia dismissed the accusation as "insane." "Gia Krialashvili was killed, and Koba Otanadze and Levan Amiridze were wounded as a result of a shootout when they resisted arrest," Grigol Beselia, the head of the crime department at the Interior Ministry, told a news briefing. The shootout occurred in a suburb of Tbilisi. There were no other details. Otanadze was the alleged ringleader of the mutiny. He and Amiridze were transferred to a Tbilisi hospital. The mutiny deepened fears of anti-government unrest in the former Soviet republic, where the opposition has been protesting since early April demanding Saakashvili quit over his record on democracy and last year's war with Russia. It also cast doubt on the loyalty of the military, which was routed by Russia in five days last August after Georgia launched an assault on the breakaway pro-Russian region of South Ossetia. News of the mutiny broke on the eve of month-long NATO exercises in Georgia, condemned by Russia as "muscle-flexing" in the South Caucasus -- a region Moscow considers part of its traditional sphere of influence but which serves as a transit route for oil and gas to Europe. The government had offered 50,000 Georgian Lari ($30,300) for information on the whereabouts of Krialashvili and Amiridze, and 200,000 Lari for information on Otanadze.
