<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 19 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary watchdog has suggested greater tax holiday facilities and said the government's position on not offering the concession afresh in the new budget is "irresponsible". Finance minister AMA Muhith on May 14 said there would be no more tax holiday to encourage new industries in the next budget. "The statement that there will be no more new tax holidays is irresponsible," chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on finance ministry, A H M Mostafa Kamal, said on Tuesday. Muhith, however, had said the institutions already enjoying the facility would continue to do so until the time specified. New production-focused industries will be given tax facilities through other measures, the minister had said. "Industries established under tax holiday see profits as long as they enjoy the facility. But when the holiday ends, they count losses and eventually shut down," Muhith had said, explaining the reason for the decision. The panel chairman, better known as Lotus Kamal, said, "We've suggested for expansion of tax holiday facilities. We know the facilities are necessary for industrialisation." "The country's 80 percent industries are established under the tax holiday facilities; there aren't too many industries to stop the facility," Kamal said at a roundtable on 'Upcoming national budget: Future Bangladesh' organised by Bengali Daily Inquilab. The apex trade body FBCCI president Annisul Huq also favoured continuation of tax holidays. "The tax holiday facility is a must for the sake of industrialisation. We're working for poverty alleviation and it's not possible without the facility." He asked why the facility will not be extended to the local entrepreneurs if it is given for the setting up Export Processing Zones. Most of the investors in the EPZ are foreigners. The former president of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Salman F Rahman, said easing power crisis was the top priority was the businesses. Salman, the private investment affairs adviser to the Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina, stressed on a cut in the lending rate. He further suggested the government reduced poverty by putting more thrust on the agriculture and industries sectors. bd
