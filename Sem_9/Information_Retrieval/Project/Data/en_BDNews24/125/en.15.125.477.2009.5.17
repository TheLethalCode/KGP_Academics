<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 17 (bdnews24.com)Sunday is the 28th anniversary of prime minister and Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh from exile. Living abroad, the two daughters of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Hasina and sister Sheikh Rehana had survived the assassination of the independence leader and his family on Aug 15, 1975. Permitted by the government, Hasina returned to her homeland in 1981, six years after the killings. Prior to her return, the AL national council formed in Feb 1981 elected her president of the party. On arrival in Bangladesh, Hasina launched the reorganisation of the party. In the backdrop of the recent death of Hasina's husband Dr MA Wazed Miah, the day is being observed this year with due austerity. Bangabandhu Sanskritik Jote organised a Milad and discussion in the morning at Awami League central office on Bangabandhu Avenue. Another discussion organised by Awami Jubo League will be held in the afternoon at the Engineers' Institution, Bangladesh in the capital.
