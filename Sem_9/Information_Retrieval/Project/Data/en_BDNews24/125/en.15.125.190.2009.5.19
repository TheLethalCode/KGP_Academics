In a speech to the UN-sponsored Conference on Disarmament, Ban said a draft proposal to start negotiations on fissile material at the same time as talks related to preventing an arms race in outer space, "can achieve consensus".

"Now is the time to break more than 10 years of stalemate," Ban said. The 65-member-state forum has failed to clinch any pacts since its international treaties banning chemical weapons and underground nuclear explosions in the 1990s. Its members include the five official nuclear weapon powers -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- as well as nuclear-capable India and Pakistan, and Israel, widely believed to have the Middle East's only nuclear arms. Algerian foreign minister Mourad Medelci said in a speech that he hoped for a consensus to emerge at the talks, adding: "The conditions have never been as encouraging." Swiss foreign minister Micheline Calmy-Rey said: "This is a moment of hope, as it appears we are on the verge of the breakthrough that has been eagerly awaited for several y
