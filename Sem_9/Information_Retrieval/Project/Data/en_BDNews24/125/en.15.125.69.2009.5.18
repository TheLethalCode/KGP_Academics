<TITLE> Bangabandhu Gold Cup to be revived: BFF </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 18 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Football Federation is strongly considering reviving the Bangabandhu International Gold Cup football tournament from next season. "We are going to hold the Bangabandhu International Gold Cup from next season and I have already started initial talks with the different football associations," BFF president Kazi Salahuddin told reporters on Monday without mentioning the date. BFF's next season will get underway from August and end in May next year. Salahuddin hinted that the participating teams and the time of the tournament might be finalised in the FIFA congress on June 2 in the Bahamas as he would discuss the matter with other nations. "I can assure you that better teams will participate in the tournament as now we are not in our previous position. We will choose the teams," said Salahuddin hinting that they would love like to teams from Middle East and Asian region. He also said that they had also interest in Mohan Bagan and East Bengal from Kolkata, who were well known to the Bangladeshi people. The BFF boss, however, made it clear that six foreign and two local teams -- probably Abahani and Mohammedan -- would take part in the tournament. The Bangabandhu Gold Cup was last held in 1999 and since then there was virtually no international competitions organised by the BFF though the country's football body organised different AFC meets as well as SAFF Championship. The BFF president had earlier also declared that the International Super Cup, comprising foreign clubs as well as local teams, would be held regularly from next year. bd
