 Dhaka, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com)--Recruiting agents have urged the government to launch diplomatic efforts to raise manpower export to four countries, including Saudia Arabia, a major destination for Bangladeshi labourers. At a press conference on Monday in the city, Bangladesh Association of International Recruiting Agencies president Golam Mustafa said: "Bangladesh can export 8-10 lakh manpower this year if restrictions on export to those countries go." The three other countries are Malaysia, Kuwait and Iraq. Mustafa said the Saudi visa issuance rate for workers has dropped to 5 percent, while there are complete embargo on manpower export to Malaysia and Kuwait. Though Iraq has resumed import, the rate is still very low, he added. According to the government's Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training (BMET), out of around 6.5 million Bangladesh labourers working abroad, over 25 lakh are in Saudi Arabia. Bangladeshi labourers remitted foreign exchanges worth $ 10.72 billion in 2009, when the country exported 4.75 lakh new manpower. The Baira chief hoped that the inflow of remittance would rise further this year and urged the government to take necessary measures to facilitate the increase. The rate of expulsion of Bangladeshi workers due to their involvement with irregularities and illegal activities has been up, according to Mustafa. He said the 72,210 Bangladesh labourers came back home in 2009, 70,960 of whom had gone abroad for work without passport. He urged the government to check Bangladeshis labourers' going abroad on visit visa or without visa. The Baira chief proposed spending 5 percent of the total remittances in setting up international-standard technical training centres to create skilled manpower. b
