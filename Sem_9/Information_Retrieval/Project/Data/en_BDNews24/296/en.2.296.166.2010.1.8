 Dhaka, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com)  BNP standing committee member Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury said he expects that prime minister Sheikh Hasina will return from India visit with fair share of river water and an announcement on scrapping of Tipaimukh dam project. "I am positive about the India trip of prime minister Sheikh Hasina. She will talk in the interest of the country," he said at a roundtable on Friday. The roundtable titled 'Has the government failed to provide security to the diplomats' was organised by National People's Party. "We want solutions to different problems with India. For this we want to strengthen the hands of prime minister. Don't think you are weak," he said. Hasina is visiting India one year after her assuming the power. The four-day trip starts from Jan 10. "The people of this country know that the Indian government has a close relationship with those in power now. Although some are sceptical I am hopeful," he said. He praised Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman for his success in forcing India to withdraw their soldiers from this country after independence. He also praised the prime minister for using modest language in her speech on the occasion of the first anniversary of her government. However, he criticised provocative remarks of her ministers. "The prime minister said nothing about how many cases were filed against the opposition party, how many opposition leaders and workers were killed, how many cases were filed against Tarique Rahman, how many times the government went to the court to invalidate the residence of the opposition leader and how many cases against the government were withdrawn by abusing power," he said. He said he would have greeted the prime minister had there been any congruity between her words and actions. Mentioning some sections of the verdict of justice ABM Khairul Haque about Fifth Amendment, he said, "We want the prime minister to implement this verdict. Try all the Uddins including Moin U Ahmed." He criticised the government for its initiative to ban Islamic parties by returning to the constitution of 72. The roundtable was presided over by NPP president Shawkat Hossain Nilu. BNP vice president Rajia Foyez, senior joint secretary Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, Jamaat-e-Islami assistant secretary general Muhammad Kamaruzzaman, Islami Oikyajote secretary general Abdul Latif Nezami, Jatiya Gonotantrik Party president Shafiul Alam Prodhan, Bangladesh Jatiya Party (Matin) secretary general Abu Naser Md Rahmatullah, National Democratic Party president Khandakar Golam Murtaza, Nap secretary general Goalm Mostafa Bhuiyan, Muslim League secretary general Atiqul Islam, Labour Party general secretary Mustafizur Rahman Iran spoke among others. bd
