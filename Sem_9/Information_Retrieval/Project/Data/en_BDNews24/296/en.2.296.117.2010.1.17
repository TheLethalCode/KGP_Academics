 bdnews24.com New Delhi Correspondent New Delhi, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina must be regretting her decision of dropping Kolkata from her itinerary during her recent visit to India and thus losing the last chance to see a legendary Indian leader she had long respected  Jyoti Basu. Hasina expressed great sorrow at Basu's death on Sunday. She told parliament that the Ganges water treaty and Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord were signed mainly due to Basu, "a true friend of Bangladesh". While delivering her speech on Basu's life and contribution to politics, Hasina said she would go to Kolkata to attend the funeral. She also said Basu's ancestral home in Sonargaon, Narayanganj, would be turned into a library according to his desire. Hasina was speaking in parliament as the Jatiya Sangsad Speaker Abdul Hamid moved a condolence motion. The House unanimously adopted the motion and the speaker withheld all other parliamentary business. The MPs also stood for one minute of silence. Basu, who passed away in Kolkata around midday, was critically ill during Hasina's January 10-13 India tour. She had voiced her concern over the deteriorating health of the ailing Marxist patriarch, who ruled India's eastern state of West Bengal as chief minister for 23 long years. "We are very worried about the health of Jyoti Basu who is a highly respected in both India and Bangladesh. I wanted to see him during my trip to India but could not make it," Hasina had told journalists in New Delhi at the end of her visit. "But I will see him when I come here next time," she had added  a word she would never be able to keep now. The prime minister was originally scheduled to go to West Bengal during her visit, not only to meet the ailing communist leader in Kolkata, but also to visit Vishwa Bharati at Shantiniketan. But she later returned home only after visiting Delhi and Ajmer. Hasina's respect for Basu was evident in a letter she had written to the communist patriarch of India on February 4, 2009  just a few weeks after she became prime minister following the Awami League-led coalition's landslide victory in the parliamentary elections. She had sought Basu's blessings for her second tenure as Bangladesh prime minister. "Bless me so that we can live up to the expectation of people and fulfil the responsibilities entrusted on us, honour the verdict of the people and truly work for developing my country as the Shonar Bangla (Golden Bangladesh)," Hasina had written to Basu. Hasina had also expressed concern over the failing health of Basu. "I am quite worried to know that you are ill. I wish you quick recovery and am looking forward to meet you in future," she had added. She had also expressed confidence that the friendship between India and Bangladesh would be strengthened in the coming days. Hasina's letter had in fact been in response to Basu's congratulations to her after the Awami League led coalition's victory in the parliamentary elections. Basu had congratulated Hasina and the Awami League and conveyed his good wishes for the people of Bangladesh. "I knew late Mujibur Rahman (Bangabadhu and father of Hasina) from the days when he was involved in student organisations and I had very cordial relations with him," the nonagenarian leader had said. "She (Hasina) called on me at my residence when she came on a visit to India," he had said, recalling her tour to Kolkata as the leader of the opposition in Bangladesh Jatiya Sansad in 2006. Basu, as chief minister of West Bengal, had played an instrumental role during Hasina's visit to India during her first term in 1996, when Delhi and Dhaka had signed the treaty for sharing of water of Ganges. The then Indian external affairs minister I K Gujral had lauded the role played by Basu in a suo motu statement in the Indian Parliament's upper House Rajya Sabha on December 12, 1996. He had put on record the appreciation of India's Union Government for the "very constructive role played by the chief minister of West Bengal and his cabinet colleagues in bringing about an improved atmosphere in which the treaty between India and Bangladesh has become possible." Basu had in 1999 travelled to the capital of Bangladesh with the then Indian prime minister Atal Behari Vajpayee during the inauguration of the bus service between Kolkata and Dhaka. A few months after taking over as prime minister, Hasina had launched an initiative to turn Basu's ancestral house at Barodi in Narayanganj district of Bangladesh into a museum and library and had in July 2009 sent the Awami League MP Obaidul Quader to survey the house and report to her so that a detailed plan could be chalked out. With Basu no more; prime minister can now expedite the implementation of her plan to pay homage to one of the greatest communist icons of the sub-continent.
