<TEXT>
 Narayanganj, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com)  One of his wishes remains unfulfilled as Jyoti Basu, the Marxist patriarch and former chief minister of the Indian state of West Bengal, will not be there to inaugurate a museum at his ancestral home in Bangladesh. The museum complex was being planned at his ancestral home at Chowdhurypara, a little village on the bank of the river Megha under Barodi union in Narayanganj district. The Awami League-led coalition government after assuming office took an initiative to set up the museum, containing a collection of memorabilia and a library, in the ornate two-storied building, which was the ancestral home of the legendary Indian politician. With the news of Jyoti Basu's death on Sunday, a pall of gloom descended on the village as people thronged his ancestral home to pay homage to their son of the soil. Basu spent a part of his childhood in this two-storied building, though decaying now, that still stands tall on the bank of the Meghna, at Barodi's Chowdhurypara. 75-year old Shahidullah and his family live at the building and take care of the house. His mother Ayatunnessa used to look after Basu in his childhood. The building with 2.04 acres of surrounding land has two rooms along with a drawing room on the top floor and another two rooms and a meeting space on the ground floor. There is also a pond and a variety of trees in the premises. Family of Basu lived at this house in early 1940s before moving to Kolkata, West Bengal. Nishikantu Basu, father of Jyoti Basu, was a doctor by profession, but he also had a number of other businesses. He would come to visit the ancestral home quite often. Doctor NK Basu, as he was familiarly known in the village, married Hemalota, daughter of Khirodha Sundari of Barodi Chowdhurypara. Khirodha Sundari, who was Jyoti Basu's maternal grandmother, in fact, owned the house after her husband's death. Ayatunnesa, mother of Shahidullah, was given the charge for bringing up Jyoti Basu as he had lost his mother in his childhood. The responsibility of taking care of the house was given to Shahidullah. Yusuf Ali, president of Jyoti Basu Samajkalyan Parisad, said Jyoti Basu's maternal grandfather Sharatchandra Das owned the house of Baradi Chowdhurypara in Sonargaon. Jyoti Basu's father would come to visit the village often and would treat patients for free during his stays. Jyoti Basu would sometime accompany his father during those village trips. Jyoti Basu was the youngest among his three siblings. His elder brother was Surendra Kumar Basu and sister Sudha Datta Basu. No blood relatives of Basu now live in the village. Yusuf Ali also recalled that Jyoti Basu visited his ancestral home and stayed there for sometime during his two visit to Bangladesh on January 30, 1987 and on Novmber 11, 1997. The cultural affairs ministry has now taken over the house and put it under the Department of Archaeology, and planning to set up the museum, Obaidul Kader, chairman of parliamentary standing committee on the ministry, revealed this while visiting the house on July 15, 2009. Kader said that the museum would be inaugurated by Jyoti Basu himself. The house has been recorded as a vested property. The government also planned to name a road after Basu in addition to conserving and renovating the house and setting up the museum and library there. Swadesh Chandra Das, a businessman of Barodi Bazar, reflected on the importance of the house and said, "Jyoti Basu is our pride. The name of Barodi, is now well-known at home and abroad just for him. So, we urge that the complex be set up as soon as possible to preserve his memory." He said that if the museum complex is built it would attract tourists to visit this remote village. bdnew
