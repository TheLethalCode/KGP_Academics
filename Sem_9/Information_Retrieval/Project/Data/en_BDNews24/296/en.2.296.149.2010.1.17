 Dhaka, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com)BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, in a televised press conference on Sunday, claimed prime minister Sheikh Hasina "signed a secret security deal" with New Delhi during her recent trip to India She said prime minister Sheikh Hasina "brought nothing back" from her recently-concluded tour of India and said the deals signed had amounted to "a sell-out" of Bangladesh's interests. The opposition chief dodged a query whether she, if elected again, would scrap the deals signed by Hasina. "I haven't seen the agreements," she said, prompting another question: "So what are you objecting to." Khaleda replied: "The joint communique has it all." "Everything Bangladesh had to offer, it handed to India on this visit," Khaleda said at her Gulshan office, as senior party leaders, including BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, other standing and advisory committee members, sat in attendance behind her. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina just 24 hours before had strongly defended the outcome of her visit, tackling some of the criticisms that have been aired by the opposition since her return, at a formal press briefing for the media and public, the first of its kind to be attended by scores of senior journalists and televised live from the Prime Minister's Office. Staged in the open at front of the Prime Minister's Office, Hasina's briefing saw a huge turnout by ruling party and alliance members in a show of support for the "success" of her India tour, which the opposition alliance has repeatedly called a "total failure". The prime minister at the press conference also urged the opposition to return to parliament and place their criticisms in the House. Hasina on return from India had said her visit marked the start of a new era of cooperation between the two neighbours. Critics, mainly the opposition BNP, have said Bangladesh gained no more than vague assurances while India secured concrete gains. The prime minister returned home on January 13 after a four-day visit to the neighboring country. Bangladesh and India on Jan 11 signed three agreements on combating crime and two MoUs on power cooperation and cultural exchange, among other bilateral arrangements. Progress was made on connectivity, including corridors for Bangladesh to Bhutan and Nepal, use of Mongla and Chittagong ports by India and joint rail and other infrastructure projects with major Indian assistance. The use of ports by India has been one of the arrangements most criticised by the opposition who see a threat to Bangladesh's "sovereignty". Khaleda on Sunday contradicted Hasina's argument that Chittagong and Mongla ports were underutilised and allowing India to use them would ensure full use of their capacity and bring enormous benefits. 'INDIFFERENCE' The opposition leader also criticised what she termed as the prime minister's "indifference" to the Tipaimukh dam issue. She said the joint statement released during Hasina's visit suggested that she had sold out the interests of the country to India and given a green signal to carry on the Tipamukh dam project. Hasina has said her Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh assured that Bangladesh's interests would not be harmed by India's planned dam, while, according to at least two members of the Hasina's entourage to India, New Delhi has said all work on the dam will be stopped. 'SECRET DEAL' Referring to reports of a section of the media, Khaleda also claimed the prime minister had also signed a security deal "in secret" with India. "She kept mum on the deal during her press conference suggesting that the reports are correct." She termed the joint statement released during the visit a communiqu of India and Awami League. "It's not a statement of Bangladesh and India." Referring to Hasina's call to BNP to join parliament to discuss the outcome of the visit, Khaleda said there is no scope of discussing the matter in parliament since the deals are already signed. She said every citizen of the country is afraid of the outcome of the visit. Khaleda urged the people to unite and get prepared for "a national movement" to prevent the enforcement of the deals
