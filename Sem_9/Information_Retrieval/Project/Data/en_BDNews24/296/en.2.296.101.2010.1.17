 Dhaka, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com)  Charges against 60 BDR members in Satkhira, accused of siding with the mutineers in the border guards' revolt in their Peelkhana headquarters in Dhaka last year, will be framed on Monday. The special court will sit at around 10am on Monday at the 41 Rifles Battalion headquarters at Taltoli in Satkhira after an adjournment of 41 days, the battalion's captain Lt Col Iqbal Aziz told reporters on Sunday. Some 61 border guards under 7 Rifles Battalion based in Neeldumur will face trial in the Satkhira court. All of them are detained in Satkhira jail. The suspected mutineers were produced before the court on Dec 7 last year. Next day, the special court adjourned the trial sessions. 7 Rifles Battalion commander Lieutenant Colonel Badrul Alam brought charges against them for breach of discipline, vandalism and looting under the BDR Act-1972. BDR director general Major General Moinul Islam headed a three-member bench of judges. The two other judges were Lieutenant Colonel Gazi Khalid Hossain and Major Lutful Karim. The trial of suspected BDR mutineers in Satkhira region is the second trial after the first BDR mutiny trial in a Rangamati court last month. The bloody Feb 25-26 mutiny killed over 73 people, 57 of them army officers deputed to the paramilitary force. The rebellion also spread to other BDR posts around the country. On Nov 15, the government formed six special courts, including two in Dhaka, to try some 3,500 border guards accused in some 40 cases around the country. In the event of a guilty finding, the maximum penalty for rebellion is seven years in jail. The six special courts are trying charges of killings, looting and arson. There have been 31 cases filed across the country on charges related to the BDR mutiny. bdne
