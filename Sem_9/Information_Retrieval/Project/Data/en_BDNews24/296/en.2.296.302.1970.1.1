 By Syed Nahas Pasha bdnews24.com London Correspondent London, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com)--UK foreign secretary David Miliband has singled out young British Bangladeshi candidates standing for Labour in the local elections slated for May including Tulip Siddiq. Siddiq, daughter of Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina's younger sister, Rehana, and a Cambridge University graduate, will run for Camden, while Nadhim Ahmed will vie for Brent and Papya Quereshi will have a shot at Westminster. Miliband said: "I am particularly pleased to see a number of bright young Bangladeshi's standing for Labour in the May local elections in North West London. "They are clear evidence that the links between the Bangladeshi community and the Labour Party are alive and flourishing, shaped by our shared values: community, solidarity, social justice." He was speaking to an audience of Bangladeshi voters in Kilburn, North West London. Event was organised by Glenda Jackson MP and British Bangladeshi businessmen Parvez Ahmed. Miliband said, "The Labour government has since 1997 been one of the most internationalist ever and has put relations with Bangladesh on a completely new footing. We should be extremely proud of our international record." Other gusts at the event included Dawn Butler MP, Brent South, Virendra Sharma, Ealing and Southall, Navin Shah, assembly member, Robert Evans, former MEP and Mary Turner MBE, president GMB Union. The foreign secretary highlighted the strong links between the UK and Bangladesh and praised the role Bangladeshis have played in the Labour Party. "Bangladesh is an increasing key player in the international community, but despite huge progress since its independence in 1971 it still faces challenges," he said. "Bangladesh and the UK have deep historic and cultural ties. With many British people of Bangladeshi origin living in the UK, we enjoy a vibrant partnership." Miliband said the UK has the largest bilateral aid programme to Bangladesh, with existing commitments worth 1 billion, and is working closely with the Bangladesh government "to support democracy, boost trade and investment, fight extremism, tackle climate change, promote education and human rights and to fight poverty." He observed that Bangladesh is likely to be one of the worst victims of climate change in the coming years, and the UK is helping to ensure Bangladesh has requisite funding from the international community to adapt to global warming. "As progressive politicians we know that our values and commitments to peace, justice and security transcend national borders. Today's challenges can be met only with more not less co-operation, and our internationalist commitments will continue to guide our work.
