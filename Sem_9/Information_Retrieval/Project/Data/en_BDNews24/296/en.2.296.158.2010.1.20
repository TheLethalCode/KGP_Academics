 Chittagong, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com)  India were 122 for one before bad light stopped play on the third day of the first Test against Bangladesh at the Zohur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium in Chittagong on Tuesday. Gautam Gambhir and nightwatchman Amit Mishra were batting on 47 and 24 respectively. The tourists, who began their second innings with a slender one-run lead having dismissed the home side for 242, lost stand-in captain Virender Sehwag (58-ball 45).
