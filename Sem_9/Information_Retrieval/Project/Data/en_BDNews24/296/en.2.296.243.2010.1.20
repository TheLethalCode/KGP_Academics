 Dhaka, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com)Police are trying to identify the armed student cadres behind Monday's violence at Dhaka University campus, sparked by two factions of Jatyatabadi Chhatra Dal, from footage and photographs. Police said they were trying to track down the culprits who were seen brandishing arms in front of law enforcers, cameramen and photographers during the clashes between the JCD factions, while rivals Chhatra League also reportedly became involved at one point. Dhaka Metropolitan police commissioner AKM Shahidul Haque has said, "We are trying to identify the armed men from TV footage and pictures of the clashes which appeared on different TV channels and in newspapers. A case was filed on Tuesday night implicating eight men, all JCD central committee leaders, and a drive is on to arrest them, he said. A police officer of Ramna Zone also claimed that one youth brandishing a pistol, whose photo appeared in newspapers, was identified as an outsider, not a university student. Efforts were on to capture him, he said. Meanwhile, an emergency meeting of DU syndicate on Tuesday formed an eight-member high powered committee with pro-vice chancellor Harun-or-Rashid as convener to probe into Monday's clashes in the campus. The armed clashes involving gunfire left at least 20 people injured, including the Shahbagh police chief Rezaul Karim who was admitted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. DU proctor Prof Saiful Islam Khan was also hurt and admitted to BSMMU Hospital. JCD president Sultan Salauddin Tuku was also rushed to DMCH. Two rival groups of JCD, the student front of main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), and Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL), the student wing of the ruling Awami League, have been blaming each other for the violence. BCL president Mahmud Hasan Ripon said at a press conference at Madhu's Canteen on Tuesday, "The armed clashes occurred due to internal feuding within Chhatra Dal." "Those who were involved in the clash ludicrously called a strike on the campus demanding resignation of the vice chancellor," he said, dismissing the allegation that BCL was involved in the clash. A JCD leader alleged that a Chhatra League worker carrying a club or stick from Surya Sen Hall came running towards Tuku and hit him in the head just in front of police. Also blaming Chhatra League, JCD general secretary Amirul Islam Alim said, "Chhatra League swooped on Chhatra Dal with arms and the allegation of internal feud in JCD was nothing but an excuse." He complained that only central leaders of Chhatra Dal have been implicated in the case filed with Shahbagh police station but no Chhatra League workers nor those who were identified as JCD rebels were accused. The rebel group of JCD also called a press conference on Tuesday at Shaheed Minar and squarely blamed the JCD president and secretary for Monday's armed clashes. At the press conference, a JCD leader Nasima Akhter Shimu alleged that Chhatra Dal president Tuku and general secretary Alim had tried to enter the campus escorted by armed men. Chhatra Dal leaders who are against such shows of force, along with general students, chased them and gave Tuku a mass beating, she said. bdnews24.com/gma
