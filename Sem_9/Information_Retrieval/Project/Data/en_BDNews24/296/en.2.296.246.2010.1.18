 Dhaka, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com)--The finance minister says Bangladesh needs to decentralise the budget and some government activities to graduate to a mid-income state. According to him, these two factors are most crucial for the country to alleviate from a least developed country by 2021. "Otherwise it may take us 2036 to be a mid-income state," AMA Muhith told reporters on Monday after attending the High-Level Asia-Pacific Policy Dialogue on the Brussels Programme of Action for the least developed countries at the city's Pan Pacific Sonargaon Hotel. He said that the country needs to improve its education sector and raise the standards of health services and nutritional status. "Public investment should also increase along with the private sector. We cannot graduate to a mid-income state unless a GDP growth of 8 percent is achieved." Referring to Awami League's campaign promise of an 8 percent GDP growth by 2015, the minister said if the trend continues, Bangladesh would be a mid-income state by 2021. "And for this we need to decentarlise government activities and the budget," he added. Replying to a query from the media, Muhith stressed strengthening the local government for decentralisation. "Issues like, health and education should be dealt by the local government. The central government should be concerned with matter like foreign policy, economic decisions and revenue." The finance minister came down hard on developed nations, saying they went back on their promises of aid for LDCs equivalent to 0.2 percent of their GDPs. "The situation has worsened. There were 29 LDCs in 1989, now the number is 49." The global financial recession and climate change have made LDCs more vulnerable, observed Muhith. Earlier in the morning, prime minister Sheikh Hasina inaugurated the three-day conference. The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and the Bangladesh government are co-organising the programme. The session aims to bring together policymakers from the governments of LDCs with eminent persons and independent experts to evaluate the progress of the implementation of the Brussels Programme of Action for the LDCs. It also targets to come up with medium and long-term recommendations that would be useful for the regional review. The Brussels Programme of Action for the least developed countries for the decade 2001-2010, which was endorsed by the UN General Assembly, represents a time-bound comprehensive poverty reduction strategy with 30 internationally agreed development goals. Senior government policymakers and other stakeholders from LDCs, UN representatives, regional organisations, development partners and experts from the Asia-Pacific region are participating in the programme.
