 KABUL, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two minutes into an interview about how best to reintegrate the Taliban into Afghan society, a giant boom stopped a top presidential adviser mid-sentence. "Oh my God, again it's a suicide (bomber)," said Mohammad Masoom Stanekzai, adviser to the Afghan president on home security and the man in charge of devising a plan to reintegrate the Taliban. "This is how you work in a country in war," he added, after which several more blasts followed, most probably grenades. A volley of gunshots was heard as Afghan security forces battled insurgents nearby. Seemingly unfazed by the background noise, Stanekzai said he wanted to continue with the interview, offering tea. "This can happen in any country, even a stable one." Not quite. Monday's attacks, in which suicide bombers blew themselves up at several locations in Kabul and heavily armed militants fought a pitched battle with security forces, were brazen even by the standards of this country. For months, Stanekzai has been working on a plan to reintegrate lower to mid-level Taliban fighters and bring them down from the hills, offering job training and protection once they make the decision to lay down their arms. "This is why we have to prevent more people from joining this madness," said Stanekzai, who later heard his nephew was among those injured in Monday's strikes. The new reintegration programme "is one of the most important things that we are doing, but hopefully this kind of violence will turn people against them," he said in an interview in the vice-presidential compound near the scene of the attacks. Staff in the compound were locked down as the attacks unfolded, prevented from leaving the building and moved away from windows. Streets nearby were blocked by security forces as helicopters clattered overhead and the sound of wailing ambulance sirens could be heard rushing to the scene. MESSAGE Stanekzai's reintegration plan is expected to be discussed by allies at an international conference in London on Jan. 28. He said he expected the Taliban were launching attacks before then as a show of force. "Usually, this is the kind of thing they are doing. If there is a big event they do this. This is the kind of message they want to get to the media: that they can do something like this." People in Afghanistan were tired of the war and wanted to live in peace, he said. The hope was that with increased military pressure, there would be an opportunity for insurgents to give themselves up and realize "they are not on the winning side." However, he stressed the young men with explosives strapped inside their jackets who caused mayhem in Kabul on Monday were not on the list for reintegration. "These are the ones who have to be brought to justice," he said. "The long-term impact of these programs is to prevent these kinds of incidents from happening." "This is a tough life. It is a pity we have been like this for the past 30 years. Something has to be changed. Every day people are sacrificed without knowing for what," he said. Minutes later, his chief of staff interrupted the interview. "Maybe it is time to go downstairs," he said, leading the official and the interviewer into a safe room in the basem
