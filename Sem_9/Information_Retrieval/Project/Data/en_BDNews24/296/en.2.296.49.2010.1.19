 Dhaka, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com)  Indians were paying their last respects in Kolkata on Tuesday to former chief minister of West Bengal Jyoti Basu who died on Sunday at the age of 95. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina departed Dhaka for the West Bengal capital in the morning to attend the funeral of the iconic Marxist leader, whose ancestral home was in Sonargaon, near Dhaka. Basu, who headed a CPI(M) government in West Bengal for 23 years from 1977, was being given state honours and a gun salute on his last journey before his body is handed over to a hospital in Kolkata for medical research. Congress president Sonia Gandhi, former prime minister Deva Gouda, union minister Sharad Power, former speaker Purno Agitok Sangma and other Indian leaders were paying tribute to the late leader, while thousands and thousands of ordinary people were also paying homage to India's communist patriarch. Around 2,000 police personnel were deployed in the city to ensure order and discipline during the funeral. The coffin carrying Basu's body was covered with wreaths at West Bengal's Bidhan Sabha (lower house of state legislature) as the funeral rituals began in the morning. West Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya and other ministers of the state paid their tributes to Basu at Mohakaran, the secretariat building of the state government, while CPI(M) leaders paid homage to their leader at the party office at Alimuddin Road earlier in the morning. Indian TV showed BJP leader and former Indian minister LK Advani, former minister Lalu Prasad Yadab, Tripura chief minister Manik Sarkar, Jharkhand chief minister Shibu Soren, Andhrapradesh chief minister Chandra Babu Naidu, former West Bengal chief minister Siddhartha Shankar Rao and other leaders from different states paid respect to Basu at the Bidhan Sabha. b
