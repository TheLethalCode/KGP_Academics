 Dhaka, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com)Communications minister Abul Hossain on Tuesday turned a deaf ear to an MP who tried to drew his attention for construction of a road from Sunamganj to Sylhet.

"I see the dynamic minister is in discussion with another minister. Honourable speaker, I draw the minister's attention. I draw the minister's attention through you," Mannan said, while reading a notice on public importance. "I once again draw the attention of the communications minister," Mannan said in desperation. Abdul Matin Khasru, who sat between Hossain and information minister Abul Kalam Azad in the second row, stopped chatting to listen to Mannan. But the two ministers continued their conversation.

Deputy speaker Shawkat Ali, who was presiding over session, did not intervene. bd
