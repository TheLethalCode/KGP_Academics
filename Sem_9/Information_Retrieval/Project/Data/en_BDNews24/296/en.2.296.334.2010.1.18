 MELBOURNE, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Andy Murray overcame pre-match nerves and some wayward serving to muscle into the second round of the Australian Open with a 6-1, 6-1, 6-2 demolition of South Africa's Kevin Anderson on Monday. After breezing through the first two sets in exactly an hour, the fifth-seeded Briton's charge to victory was halted momentarily when he was broken while leading 3-1 in the third under a closed roof at Rod Laver Arena. But the Scot, who holds Britain's hopes of ending a 74-year wait for a men's Grand Slam singles champion, mowed through the next four games to seal the win.

But I played really well against him the last couple times," the 22-year-old added. Elena Baltacha made it a winning double for Britain, beating Pauline Parmentier of France 6-4, 3-6, 7-5. The 83rd-ranked Briton said she had "nothing to lose" in her second-round encounter against Ukraine's 30th seed Kateryna Bondarenko, who beat Raluca Olaru of Romania 6-2, 7-6. "She's a very good player. She's a seed, so I can just go out and just play tennis now without getting tight, and just give it everything I have," she told repor
