 COLOMBO, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka on Friday rejected as inconsistent the findings of a trio of UN-appointed investigators who said they doubted a video showing apparent executions by Sri Lankan soldiers was a fake. The reaction came after Philip Alston, UN special reporter on extrajudicial executions, on Thursday urged an independent probe after a forensic pathologist, a forensic video analyst and a firearms expert concluded the video was likely real. Britain's Channel 4 television aired a video last year that it said shows government troops killing unarmed, naked, bound and blindfolded men during the army's final assault to smash the Tamil Tiger rebels.

Nonetheless, all three concluded the footage was probably genuine, Alston said. Bogollagama said that the government was still probing the video and other allegations of war crimes through a presidential panel of Sri Lankan experts.

UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is considering setting up an expert panel to advise him on the matter and help the Sri Lankan government to address possible violations. However, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has the responsibility for investigating any war crimes allegations, a spokesman for Ban has said. Bogollagama also said that Alston had violated diplomatic protocol by making his findings public before discussing it with the Sri Lankan government. Sri Lanka's government has repeatedly denied that its forces were guilty of war crimes or human rights breaches in the last months of its 25-year war against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
