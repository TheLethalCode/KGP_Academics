 Chittagong, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com)  Shakib Al Hasan failed to attract any bids during the Indian Premier League auction in Mumbai on Tuesday. The Bangladesh captain base price was 10 million dollars in the `C' category. According to the three categories, Category A players were base priced at $2.5 lakh, Category B started at $2 lakh and Category C at $1 lakh When Shakib's name came up for auction, no franchisers were interested to acquire his services.
