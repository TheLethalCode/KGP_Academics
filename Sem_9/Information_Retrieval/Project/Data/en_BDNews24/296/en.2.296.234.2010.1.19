 Dhaka, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com)--The government on Tuesday recommended withdrawal of another 411 cases on consideration that those were pressed for 'political persecution'. State minister for law Quamrul Islam, who heads the committee concerning quashing of the political harassment cases', said they have so far received 6,793 applications to recommend case withdrawals. Among them, the committee suggested dropping of 2,380 cases including 218 filed by the Anticorruption Commission, in 12 phases, he told reporters after the 12th meeting of the committee at his office. "All the requests for case withdrawals are thoroughly scrutinised so that no criminal or terrorist can get away. Not from partisan views, the recommendations are made only if the cases are found to have been filed to harass someone," the junior minister said. As many as 869 cases were placed at Tuesday's meeting, among which 45 cases were filed by the ACC and the remainder under penal codes. "A total of 23 cases filed by ACC were recommended for withdrawal, two cases were rejected and it was decided that another 20 cases would be reviewed at the next meeting. "Under penal codes, 388 cases were recommended to be dropped, 62 cases were rejected and 374 cases were set aside for the next meeting," the state minister said. Asked how long the scrutiny will continue, Islam said, "We cannot have an exact timeframe for this. The whole process might need at least another two months." Recently, ACC chairman Golam Rahman told bdnews24.com that they will reconsider those recommended cases only after the committee is done with it work and sends a compiled recommendations. The scrutiny committee's recommendations are not enough for dropping the cases, said ACC chairman. "We will reconsider those cases and then make decisions," he added. About that matter, Islam said, "The Anticorruption Committee is independent. We only have made recommendations, the rest will be done by them." The state minister said many harassment cases were filed between 2001 and 2007 against Awami League leaders and activists. The committee earlier recommended withdrawal of a case filed against BNP senior vice chairman Tarique Rahman and another against senior BNP leader Moudud Ahmed. bdn
