 Dhaka, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com)--A group of rights activists on Monday slammed UN-ESCAP and the government for not ensuring participation of civil society organisations on a 'broad spectrum' and 'violating the aide memoire' between the organisers of a three-day Asia-Pacific LDC countries' meet. A press conference at the National Press Club on Monday, they alleged that the organisers violated the UN General Assembly resolution which demanded civil society participation on a broader spectrum. Earlier in the morning, prime minister Sheikh Hasina inaugurated the three-day Asia Pacific Dialogue on the Brussels Programmes of Action for the Least Developed Countries, being co-organised by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and the Bangladesh government. The activists raised questions about the organisers inviting corporate NGOs as civil society representatives as they do not challenge global financial and governance architecture. In a media statement, they said that the government's Economic Relations Division do not want any criticism regarding propositions of international financial institutions as they favour them. The news conference was moderated by the convener of Equity and Justice Working Group  Bangladesh (EquityBD), Rezaul Karim Chowdhury, while Mohammed Shamsuddoha read out a written statement. The statement specifically demanded immediate debt cancellation of LDCs especially that of earthquake-affected Haiti. Demands were also raised for an UN resolution for the establishment of international court on food rights to control protectionism observed in the 2008 food crisis. The organisers also demanded that agriculture is left out of WTO and duty and quota free access of LDC products and tangible commitment on aid for trade to strengthen supply side of the LDCs. The group emphasised the need for a separate negotiating block of the LDCs and MVCs (most vulnerable countries), separate from the G 77 and China block, in respect of climate negotiation, as that block is largely dominated by interests of advanced developing countries. Demanding social, cultural and economic rights of the climate change-induced migrants has been deemed urgent as it is considered a major threat to the LDCs. The group also demanded reconsideration of the UN governance structure as present governance mechanism failed to generate legally binding commitment from the countries in the Copenhagen conference to respond to popular global demand to save the planet. Badrul Alam of La Via Campesina, Ahmed Swapna of VOICE, Shahadat Islam Chowdhury of PRADIP, Zaid Iqbal of Bangladesh Krisak Federation, among others, spoke at the news confer
