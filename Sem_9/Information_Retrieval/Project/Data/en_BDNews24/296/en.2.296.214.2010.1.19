 Dhaka, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com)--The divisional and deputy commissioners have proposed changes to the new law on water bodies to lease them out to earn revenues. They told a meeting of the land ministry on Tuesday that the water bodies had been left without lease because of the regulation, deriving the exchequer of considerable revenues. The new law made it obligatory to lease out the water bodies among the fishermen associations. Land minister Rejaul Karim Hira, who was in the chair, directed the relevant authority to take necessary actions. The meeting heard that there are some 28,000 water bodies and ponds across the country from which the government earned around Tk 71 crore a year in revenue. The senior government officials said the new regulation has provision for leasing out three water bodies or ponds only to the fishermen associations. There are over 500 water bodies or ponds across the country while some districts have only three associations, they pointed out. As a result, almost all the ponds have not been leased out, which will cause revenue earning to fall considerably, they observed. They recommended provision for leasing out the water bodies to the fish cultivators'associations. The minister said the government has decided to protect water bodies and maintain ecological balance but the inconsistencies of the new regulation will be addressed to make the law more effective. He ordered formulation of a provision to make 'National Land Use Regulation 2001' effective to protect agricultural land. The minister told reporters, "Our agricultural land will diminish soon in the wake of mushroom growth of land installations and infrastructures." Stringent law will be enacted to protect the farm land, he said, adding that the law will be strictly enforced to implement national land use regulation
