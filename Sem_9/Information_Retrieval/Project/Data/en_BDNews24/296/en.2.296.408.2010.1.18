 Dhaka, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com)  The Appellate Division on Monday deferred by one day the hearing on two petitions seeking a stay order on the 2005 High Court judgment declaring the Fifth Amendment to the constitution illegal. The full bench of the division, led by chief justice Tafazzul Islam, fixed Tuesday for the hearing on the petitions by BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain and three lawyers. The petitioners had also moved to defer the hearing for another eight weeks. Delwar's counsel Moudud Ahmed submitted that they were not prepared for the hearing. "That is why we need more time." Attorney general Mahbubey Alam contended that the time-pleas were made "so that the execution of Bangabandhu murder case verdict is hindered." He said the issue has been brought to the highest court for "political purposes". The court gave the petitioners one day to be prepared for hearing. Delwar and three Jamaat-e-Islami-backed lawyers Munshi Ahsan Kabir, Tajul Islam and Kamruzzaman Bhuiyan had filed separate petitions seeking a stay on the 2005 High Court judgment. The Supreme Court earlier this month lifted an earlier stay order on the High Court ruling as the government withdrew a previous leave to appeal seeking to challenge the ruling. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam had told the media at the time that with the withdrawal of the leaves to appeal and vacation of the existing stay order, the High Court ruling was upheld, for now, despite the two more pending petitions. The High Court gave its ruling on the Fifth Amendment in August 2005 in response to a petition challenging the legality of a Marshal Law Regulation of 1977. In its ruling, the High Court declared regimes between Aug 15, 1975 and 1979, headed by Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed, Abu Sa'dat Mohammad Sayem and Ziaur Rahman illegal. The petition on which the ruling was given had been filed by an individual who claimed that his ownership of the Moon Cinema Hall had been expropriated by dint of the amendment that had legalised all the regimes between 1975 and 1979. The Fifth Amendment was meant to provide constitutional legitimacy to the governments in power -- military or otherwise -- after the assassination of president and independence hero 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1975. In 2005, an alliance government led by BNP, which was floated with the backing of General Ziaur Rahman, filed a leave to appeal on which the Supreme Court had stayed the High Court ruling. But the incumbent government in May 2009 petitioned the court for withdrawal of that leave to appeal, a legal term for permission from court to file petition. b
