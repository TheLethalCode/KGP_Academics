 JOHANNESBURG, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Off-spinner Johan Botha, who has been banned from bowling his doosra after it was ruled illegal, has been recalled to the South Africa Test squad for their tour of India next month. Botha, 27, has played only two Tests for his country and was called for a suspect action on his Test debut against Australia in 2006. He was banned until he remodelled his action and subsequently cleared by the International Cricket Council (ICC). However, Botha was forced to undertake testing once again after his action was questioned in a one-day international against Australia and he was banned from bowling the doosra, the delivery which turns away from the right-hander. Botha is included in the Test squad along with left-arm spinner Paul Harris, who was omitted from the fourth Test side who beat England by an innings on Sunday to square the series 1-1. "It is important to have a second specialist spin bowling option for a Test series on the Asian subcontinent," Cricket South Africa selection convener Mike Procter said in a statement on Monday. "We feel this squad covers all our tactical options and will give a good account of itself." Veteran fast bowler Makhaya Ntini, who was dropped against England, has been excluded while left-arm swing bowler Lonwabo Tsotsobe, who has played three one-day international but who has yet to play a Test, was named in the 15-man Test squad. South Africa will play two Tests against India with the first scheduled to start in Nagpur on Feb 6. Squads: Test: Graeme Smith (captain), Hashim Amla, Johan Botha, Mark Boucher, AB de Villiers, JP Duminy, Paul Harris, Jacques Kallis, Ryan McLaren, Morne Morkel, Wayne Parnell, Alviro Petersen, Ashwell Prince, Dale Steyn, Lonwabo Tsotsobe. ODI: Smith (captain), Loots Bosman, Botha, Boucher, AB de Villiers, JP Duminy, Herschelle Gibbs, Kallis, Albie Morkel, Morne Morkel, Parnell, Petersen, Steyn, Tsotsobe, Roelof van der M
