 Dhaka, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com)New SAARC chamber chief Annisul Huq blames political mindset being the major constraint behind slow growth of intra-regional investment in South Asia. He says there are many hurdles to overcome to reach far into the limitless possibilities. Huq, also president of Bangladesh's apex trade body FBCCI, made the statements at the inaugural session of a seminar on regional cooperation and potential sectors for joint ventures at Sonargaon Hotel in Dhaka on Monday. Asked about his take on prime minister Sheikh Hasina's recent visit to India, he said it was good to open bilateral trade with India. "Development can't be ensured if there's no trade with a neighbouring country." The eight SAARC countries had many constraints including communications, connectivity and different non-tariff barrier issues, said Huq, who on Sunday took over as president of SAARC Chamber of Commerce and Industries (SCCI). Monday's seminar, co-organised by the SCCI and the FBCCI, was supported by Friedrich Naumann Foundation, a Germany-based group advising on liberal politics. He stressed an immediate, effective policy to foster current trade in the region and welcomed the recent removal of barriers of investment from Bangladesh by India. Former SAARC business chamber president Tariq Sayeed said, "There's a need to adopt a regional investment protocol to promote and protect intra-regional investments and joint ventures in South Asia." He urged for a united approach to melt the prevailing political ice with the warmth of economic cooperation. Citing terrorism, food security and energy security as major challenges, Sayeed said, "These should be addressed by pooling resources and synergising collective efforts." S A Samad, executive director of the Board of Investment, said the dreams must be very strong to be translated into reality. "Joint ventures may take place for large and time-consuming projects, which a single country cannot afford." Sayeed illustrated the success stories of some other regional blocks including North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the European Union. "It's unfortunate that the region of 1.5 billion people, despite tremendous export growth (from 4.3 to 20 percent) between 1990-2008 and annual GDP growth rate of 5.9 percent from 1980-2008, contributes merely 1.5 percent in global trade and 2 percent in global GDP. "Since its birth in 1985, intra-regional trade within SAARC moved up to 5.8 percent in 2009 from 3.2 percent in the '80s, whereas NAFTA sees 58 percent, 54 percent in EU, 25 percent in ASEAN and 22 percent in COMESA (Common Market for East-South Africa)," he added. Citing examples of such emerging economies as Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore, Samad of BoI said they could separate their economy from politics which disrupts development. The regional threats to trade and investment should be removed, he said adding that it would boost inter-regional and cross border trading that are currently negligible, he said. "An annual growth of 5 to 6 percent is not what we want, it should rather be around 9 to 10 percent." On her recent visit to India, Hasina and her Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh understood the need to mobilise SAARC to increase trade, said the BOI official. South Asia has an insignificant intra-regional FDI. Abu Reza Khan, BOI executive member, told the technical session that most of the foreign investment in these countries comes from other parts of the world. Participation of the SAARC countries in treaties on bilateral investment and double tax avoidance is also negligible, according to him. The BOI member said presence of at least 23 prohibited sectors in Nepal, discriminatory taxation in Bangladesh and 100 percent prohibition on foreign ownership in Pakistan are among the reasons behind poor FDIs and joint ventures in the region. bd
