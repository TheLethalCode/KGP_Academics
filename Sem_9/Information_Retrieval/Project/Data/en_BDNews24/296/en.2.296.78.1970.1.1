 BAGHDAD, Jan 17(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Iraqi court sentenced Ali Hassan al-Majeed, the Saddam Hussein henchman widely known as "Chemical Ali", on Sunday to death by hanging for a 1988 gas attack that killed about 5,000 Kurds, a court official said. Majeed, a cousin of Saddam's who earned his nickname because of his use of poison gas, was convicted for an attack on the Iraqi Kurdish town of Halabja.

Majeed also received a death sentence in December 2008 for his role in crushing a Shia revolt after the 1991 Gulf War and another in March 2009 for his involvement in killing and displacing Shi'ite Muslims in 1999. Saddam was executed in December 2006 after being convicted of crimes against humanity for the killing of 148 Shi'ite men and boys following a 1982 assassination attempt. About 290,000 people disappeared in Iraq under Saddam's rule from 1979 to 2003, according to estimates by New York-based Human Rights Watch.
