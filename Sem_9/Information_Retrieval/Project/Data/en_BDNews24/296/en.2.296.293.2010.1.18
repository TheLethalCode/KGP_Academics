 Satkhira, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com)  Trail proceedings of 60 BDR members in Satkhira, accused of siding with mutineers during the bloody events at the border force's Peelkhana headquarters in Dhaka last year, resumed on Monday after an adjournment of 41 days. The special court convened at around 10am at the 41 Rifles Battalion headquarters at Taltoli in Satkhira with BDR director general Major General Moinul Islam heading the panel of judges, the battalion's captain Lt Col Iqbal Aziz said. The two other judges are Lt Col Gazi Khalid Hossain and Major Lutful Karim. Charge framing was scheduled to start against the 60 border guards under 7 Rifles Battalion based in Neeldumur of the district. All of them are detained in Satkhira jail. The border guards accused of rebellion were produced before the court. 7 Rifles Battalion commander Lt Col Badrul Alam brought charges against them for breach of discipline, vandalism and looting under the BDR Act-1972. The mutiny trial in Satkhira region is the second after the first BDR mutiny trial was held by a special court in Rangamati in November. The bloody Feb 25-26 mutiny saw over 73 people, nearly 60 of them army officers deputed to the paramilitary force, brutally killed. Rebellion also spread to other BDR outposts around the country. On Nov 15, the government formed six special courts, including two in Dhaka, to try some 3,500 border guards accused in some 40 cases around the country. In the event of an accused found guilty, the maximum penalty for rebellion is seven years in jail. The six special courts are trying charges of mutiny, looting and arson. The killings will be tried separately under civil law. There have been 31 cases filed across the country on charges related to the BDR mutiny. bdnews
