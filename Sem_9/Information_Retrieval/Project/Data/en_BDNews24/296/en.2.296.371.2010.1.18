Replying to a notice of public importance, A B Tajul Islam told parliament on Monday that the government will also invite the foreign journalists, artists, intellectuals and others to Bangladesh in December this year and honour them. "By December this year, we will invite all of them and their family members to honour them as the country would celebrate its Victory Day," said Islam. He also said the government will prepare a list of the persons who contributed to Bangladesh's bloody nine-month freedom struggle against the occupation Pakistan army. "We have not been able to honour those generous journalists, artists, intellectuals and others who contributed to our war of independence," Islam told parliament in response to the notice served by Awami League's Rangpur MP Abul Kalam Azad. "It is high time to honour them generously as Sheikh Hasina, daughter of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, is in power," he said. "We have already initiated the process of honouring them. The government has already started contacting them through the foreign ministry." The junior minister named some such as Mark Tully, Simon Dring, George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Pandit Ravi Shankar who had extended support. "We will prepare a list of the foreign nationals who supported our freedom struggle so that the next generation can come to know about them."
