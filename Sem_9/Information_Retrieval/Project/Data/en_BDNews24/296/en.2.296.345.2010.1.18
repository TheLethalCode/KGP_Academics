<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com)  Senior BNP leader and former law minister Moudud Ahmed has said the government cannot revive the 1972 constitution. "The government can never return to the main constitution. It will require repealing oppressing laws and dropping the word 'bismillah' from the constitution that they can never do," he said on Monday while speaking at a discussion meeting at the National Press Club. Senior ministers, including law minister Shafiq Ahmed, on several occasions said the government would return to the '72 constitution, the main one adopted after Bangladesh's independence that contained the four basic principles on which the war of independence from Pakistan had been fought. Moudud, now a member of parliament, said: "Awami League cannot implement what they (AL leaders) are saying." Centre for Democracy and Peace Studies (CDPS) organised the discussion titled "Fifth amendment to the constitution is the safeguard of Bangladesh". Referring to the fifth-amendment issue, which is now pending with the Supreme Court, the former minister hoped the highest court would reject the High Court's Aug 29 (2005) verdict that declared the fifth amendment illegal. The fifth amendment had given constitutional legitimacy to military governments after the 1975 assassination of independence hero president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in a military coup. Criticising the move to ban religion-based politics, he said: "Bangladesh constitution allows politics by all people." He posed a question: "Why Islamist people will not get the right to do politics when communists and atheists can do politics here." Moudud said they want to be free from politics of division. "All people have to given right to do politics. If anyone does secret politics against the state and constitution, they are punishable under the existing law." CDPS executive director presided over the discussion, addressed among others, by BNP advisory council member Ahmed Azam Khan and journalists Abdul Hye Sikder and Baker Hossai
