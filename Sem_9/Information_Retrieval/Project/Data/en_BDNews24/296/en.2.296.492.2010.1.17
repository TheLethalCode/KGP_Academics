 Gazipur, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com)--Preparations, including security systems, for three-day annual pilgrimage 'Bishwa Ijtema' beginning on Jan 22 are at the final stages, organisers say. Around 18,000 law-enforces will maintain law and order in and around Ijtema ground in Tongi, it was revealed at the preparatory meeting at Tongi Municipality Auditorium on Sunday noon. The Ijtema, to be held on the bank of the river Turag, ends on Jan 24 through Akheri Monajat. Home minister Sahara Khatun, who attended the meeting, said she hoped the Ijtema will end successfully. "Law-enforcers always stand guard to avert militant attacks and acts of sabotage," she said, asking all others to be also alert against untoward incidents. In addition, steps have been taken so that no militants can enter there ahead of Ijtema with close-circuit cameras at the Ijtema ground and access points. Observation towers will also be installed there and Rapid Action Battalion hovering over the ground in helicopters. Preparations for water, communications and healthcare services for tens of thousands of devotees are also nearing end, the meeting heard. State minister for home Shamsul Huq Tuku, home secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikder, Rapid Action Battalion director general Hasan Mahmud, among others, attended the meeting. bdne
