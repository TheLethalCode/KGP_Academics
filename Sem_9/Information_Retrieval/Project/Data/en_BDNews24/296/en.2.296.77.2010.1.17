 UNITED NATIONS, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The UN mission chief in Haiti, Hedi Annabi, died in Tuesday's earthquake that devastated the country's capital, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced on Saturday. Annabi, a Tunisian, was believed to be 65. In a statement, Ban also confirmed the death of Annabi's deputy, Brazilian Luiz Carlos da Costa, and of the acting UN police commissioner in Haiti, Doug Coates of Canada.

For nearly a decade, he worked on a political settlement in Cambodia before joining the UN peacekeeping department where he rose to be an assistant secretary-general. He had held the Haiti job since 2007. Ban said of Annabi, da Costa and Coates that "in every sense of the word, they gave their lives for peace." By Friday, the UN death toll in Haiti had stood at 37. The deaths announced by Ban raise that to at least 40, but UN officials expect it ultimately to rise well over 100. US Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice said that under the leadership of Annabi and his team, the UN mission in Haiti "helped the country turn a corner after the suffering it endured in recent years." "This is an effort now set back by this unimaginable catastrophe," she s
