 LONDON, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - David Gold and David Sullivan, the former owners of Birmingham City, have completed the takeover of Premier League club West Ham United and want the new Olympic Stadium to be the club's future home. Icelandic bank Straumur said it had sold subsidiary CB Holding's 50 per cent stake in the club and that Sullivan and Gold would take immediate operational and commercial control. Gold moved quickly to quell speculation about the future of manager Gianfranco Zola while outlining his ambitions for the club who are entrenched in a relegation battle. "Categorically he's staying," Gold told Sky Sports News. "I will sit down with him tonight to work on some transfer targets. "We are West Ham fans, we have a seven-year plan to get them into the Champions League and turn them into a big club. "We hope we can persuade the government to let us move to the Olympic stadium which is in the same borough. It's a natural home for West Ham United." The long-term use of the 2012 Olympic Stadium is still unclear although London's winning bid for the Games stipulated that an athletics track would remain with the capacity of 80,000 scaled down to 25,000, a potential stick-point for a top-flight soccer club. While a move away from their traditional Upton Park home is a long-term project, the more pressing concern for West Ham fans will be the club's precarious league position. They are 16th in the table with only goal difference keeping them out of the relegation zone. One leading British bookmaker on Monday suspended betting on Zola becoming the next Premier League manager to be sacked. FINANCIAL SITUATION Sullivan backed the managerial set-up of Zola and former Chelsea assistant coach Steve Clarke, saying the goal was to stabilise the club after the uncertainty over its financial situation since the collapse of Iceland's banking system. "Our first priority has to be securing the Premier League status of West Ham...the long-term aim will be to put the club on a stronger financial footing," Sullivan told West Ham's website (www.whufc.com). "West Ham need stability after all the recent upheavals. We appointed four managers and parted company with two at Birmingham in 16 years. We believe in our managers and give them the time and support they need." Karren Brady, the former managing director of Birmingham and one of the country's most high-profile businesswomen, joins Gold and Sullivan at Upton Park as vice chairman. A spokesman for Straumur said the deal valued West Ham at 105 million pounds ($172.5 million). West Ham were acquired by CB Holding, a unit of Iceland's bailed-out Straumur-Burdaras bank, in June. That takeover followed the collapse of the business empire of former owner Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson, who bought West Ham in 2006 for about 85 million pounds and who had borrowed heavily from the Icelandic bank. Straumur, a major lender to Gudmundsson's holding company, was taken over by Iceland's financial authorities in March. Sullivan and David and Ralph Gold sold Premier League Birmingham City to Hong Kong businessman Carson Yeung in October. Gold and Sullivan were among a clutch of suitors for the east London club. Tony Fernandes, the CEO and founder of AirAsia, was among the interested parties but his bid was reported to have floundered when he failed to gain the 100 percent ownership he was seeking. "Deal lost on West Ham. Hopefully, new owners protect what's good. We gave awesome deal and new ideas to rejuvenate a club,'" Fernandes posted on his Twitter social networking
