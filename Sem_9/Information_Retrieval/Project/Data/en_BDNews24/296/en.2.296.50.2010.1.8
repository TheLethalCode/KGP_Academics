<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com)--The housing fair drew a huge crowd on the weekly holiday Friday, mainly from the mid-income group thanks to attractive discounts and offers from developers. The annual event by the developers' trade body, the Real Estate & Housing Association of Bangladesh (REHAB) kicked-off Tuesday at the city's Sheraton Hotel, participated by 262 REHAB members and six financial institutions. Developers have come up with innovative ideas of free gifts to woo prospective buyers, which include home appliances, cars and even diamond rings. Te fair also offers special discount offer on plots and apartment booking starting from Tk 1 lakh to as high as Tk 10 lakh. BONANZAS The practice of gifts is a pretty much old thing for the industry, but Building Technology & Ideas (BTI), a real estate company, seems to have outsmarted everyone else with its offer of diamond rings on booking of any plot and apartment in any of their projects. BTI brand manager Ayesha Siddiqui said they were also offering special discounts on their ready-to-handover apartments. Concord Real Estate has offered brand-new cars, which would be given on a lottery to those who would book for apartments in Gulshan and Banani and even on bookings of office space and shops. They also have apartments aimed at the mid-income class at their 'Lake City Satellite Town' project. Rupayan Housing Estate is also offering car as well as up to Tk 1 lakh discount. Developers like Ashian City, Mohona Developments and Nasim Real Estate have kept home appliances like fridge, television set and computes as gifts for their customers. Mission Groups is offering Dhaka-Kuala Lumpur air ticket on bookings of their apartments. But, everyone has the special discount offer during the fair. East West Properties Development Ltd, a concern of Bashundhara Group, is offering 10 percent discount during the fair. Sheletch is offering up to Tk 10 lakh discounts on their various projects. Amin Mohammed Group is offering 5 percent discount on bookings of their Century Kuakata Model Town project as well as gifts worth lakhs on other projects. SHORT ON COMMITMENTS Developers blame the city development authority RAJUK's red-tape for failing to meet deadlines for handing over real-estate to their clients. "RAJUK's awkward policy for approving plans is one of the major reasons," said Nasrul Hamid, senior vice-president of REHAB. The government cannot provide necessary utility services timely, leading developers to face the heat from customers, he added. The top official of Hamid Real Estate Corporation said that high price of land and lack of marketing platform is also hindering the sector's growth. "We have no specific place to do the marketing. It creates obstacles to the growth of our sales." The global recession, political turmoil, higher prices of raw materials and irrational marketing activities due to absence of a common marketplace had been creating problems for the sector during the last two years. GOING DIGITAL REHAB, however, solved their problem of a marketing platform, to some extent, by setting up common digital market for plots and flats named Realbazar. "The Realbazar will be a digital market place for Bangladesh real estate products with innovative features like live trading platform and online dealing room," said REHAB president Tanveerul Hoq Probal. It is a joint initiative of journalists, developers and social workers under the platform of dhakabiz.com- a financial information service of Bangladesh, he added. OTHER STAKEHOLDERS Financial institutions have also come up with special offers to make the most of the fair. Home-loan aspirants would be able to get finance for low processing fees as some banks and other financial institutions have cut the charges by 0.5 to 1 percent. Delta BRAC Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DBH), BRAC Bank, National Housing Finance and Investment Ltd and IDLC Finance have cut interest rates to sanction home loans. Standrard Charterd Bank and HSBC are also participating in the fair.
