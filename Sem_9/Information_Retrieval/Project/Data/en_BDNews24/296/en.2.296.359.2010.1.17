<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com)  India were 213-8 when bad light suspended play on the first day of the Idea Cup first Test against Bangladesh at the Zohur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium here on Sunday. Before the umpires offered the light, Sachin Tendulkar was holding the first innings together with a responsible 76 not out off 140 balls with six fours and a six. Ishant Sharma was batting on one at the close. Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan and paceman Shahadat Hossain grabbed four wickets each after the tourists were put into bat. India lost six wickets for 97 runs after going into lunch on 63 without loss. The world number one Test-ranked side lost their first wicket on 79 when acting captain Virender Sehwag (52 off 51 balls) was caught by Tamim Iqbal off Shakib. His half-century (off 45 balls) was the quickest by an Indian batsman against the Tigers. Sehwag hammered nine fours in his almost run-a-ball knock. On the same score his opening partner Gautam Gambhir (23 off 44 balls) was caught behind off Shahadat while chasing an innocuous delivery. But the loudest cheers were reserved for 'The Wall' Rahul Dravid who was yorked by Shahadat six runs later playing down the wrong line. The home side then added three more scalps with the wickets of VVS Laxman, Yuvraj Singh and Dinesh Karthik. Laxman who was stumped for seven off the bowling of Shakib after adding 22 runs with Tendulkar. The same bowler also accounted for Yuvraj who failed to put away a full toss after putting on 42 runs for the fifth wicket. One run later Karthik was caught in the gully off Shahadat who was brought on as a bowling change. The tourists, who resumed after tea on 160-6, fell into further strife when Amit Mishra and Zaheer Khan departed. Mishra was trapped lbw by Shahadat for 14 after adding 32 runs with Tendulkar while Zaheer, who was dropped on 6, was caught at point off Shakib with the score on 209. With wickets falling around him, Tendulkar, who after lunch added another feather to his illustrious career by completing 13,000 Test runs, was batting with supreme confidence. He only offered one chance when he miscued a pull shot off Shahadat on 76, but none of the three fielders converging on the ball could make the most of the gift. Dense fog meant morning's play was delayed by 90 minutes after Bangladesh won the toss and opted to field. The home side included pacer Shahadat Hossain and former IPL rebel Shahriar Nafees while Shafiul Islam was making his debut in a three-man seam attack. Sehwag was leading India in the absence of MS Dhoni, who was ruled out after complaining of a back strain on Saturday. India were also without off-spinner Harbhajan Singh due to a stiff neck. Dinesh Karthik will assume wicketkeeping responsibilitie
