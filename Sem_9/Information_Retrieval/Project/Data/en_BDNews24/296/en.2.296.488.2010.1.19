 Dhaka, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com)  Shahbagh police on Tuesday filed a case against eight top Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal leaders and 200-300 unnamed people in connection with the pro-BNP student front's factional clashes on Dhaka University campus the previous day that left 20 people injured, including the Shahbagh police chief and DU proctor. Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner Shahidul Islam told reporters that Shahbagh police sub-inspector Nasiruddin had filed the case. The accused include JCD central committee general secretary Amirul Islam Alim, senior vice-president Shahidul Islam Babul, joint secretaries Amirul Islam Khan and Asaduzzaman Palash, organising secretary Anisur Rahman Khokon, cultural secretary Tariqul Isalm Titu, social welfare secretary Mahbubul Alam Azam and Ferdous Ahmed Munna. JCD 'STRIKE' Meanwhile, JCD was observing a strike at Dhaka University to press for resignation of the vice-chancellor over Monday's clashes in which the organisation's president was also injured. Chhatra Dal leaders and activists held a brief rally at the foot of Raju Sculpture on the campus at around 9am and then left the campus. They were not allowed to enter the campus later as they failed to show identity cards to police who stepped up security in and around the campus to avert further clashes. There was a thin presence of students in the campus due to JCD's strike call while only a few departments held classes. But all scheduled examinations were being held, DU controller of examinations Baharul Haque said. Four platoons of police have been deployed on the campus to guard against any violence, police said. JCD, the associate student body of opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), called for a two-day strike on Tuesday and Thursday. At a press conference organised at the JCD central office on Monday they blamed the university authorities and their rival Bangladesh Chhatra League for the violence on the day. JCD also announced a programme for holding protest rallies across the country on Tuesday. Armed clashes between two rival groups of JCD over positions in the student organisation's newly formed committee left at least 20 people injured, including the Shahbagh police chief Rezaul Karim. DU proctor Prof Saiful Islam Khan was also hurt and admitted to BSMMU Hospital while some other injured victims were taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. JCD president Sultan Salauddin Tuku, who came under direct attack from his rivals, was also rushed to DMCH. bdnews
