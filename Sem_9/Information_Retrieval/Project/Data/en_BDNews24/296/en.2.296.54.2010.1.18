 Dhaka, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com)Charges will be framed on Feb 10 against former general secretary of the ruling Awami League, Abdul Jalil, in a tax evasion case. The Dhaka special judge's court of ANM Bashirullah on Monday extended the time for charge framing upon a petition by Jalil. The AL leader, who secured a deferral of the hearing several times earlier through similar petitions, appeared before the court for the first time on Monday. The National Board of Revenue deputy commissioner Bazlur Rahman Khan filed the case on Oct 15 last year accusing Jalil of not paying income tax worth Tk 4 lakh by concealing income of about Tk 54 lakh. The court, on the same day, issued an arrest warrant against Jalil, who secured bail three days later. Additional public prosecutor Shah Alam Talukdar told bdnews24.com that the defendant's bail would end on Monday. The charges against Jalil include concealing bank revenue information, amount of money in his and his wife's accounts, credit card information and not having income tax documents. bdnew
