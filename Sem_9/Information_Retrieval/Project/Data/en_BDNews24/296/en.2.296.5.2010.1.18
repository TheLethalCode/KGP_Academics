 Satkhira, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com)  Charges were framed against 60 Satkhira border guards on Monday accusing them of siding with mutineers during the bloody events at the BDR's Peelkhana headquarters at Dhaka in February last year. The special court, formed to bring the BDR mutineers to justice, resumed on Monday after an adjournment of 41 days. The trial was adjourned for the day at 5.25pm and will recommence on Tuesday at 9.30 am, BDR officer Col Iqbal Aziz told the reporters at a press briefing. The special court convened at the 41 Rifles Battalion headquarters at Taltoli in Satkhira with BDR director general Maj Gen Moinul Islam heading the panel of judges.

The 60 border guards, belonging to 7 Rifles Battalion based in Neeldumur of the district, were produced before the court. All of them are detained in Satkhira jail. Commander of 7 Rifles Battalion, Lt Col Badrul Alam, presented charges against them for breach of discipline, vandalism and looting under the BDR Act-1972. The mutiny trial in Satkhira region is the second after the first BDR mutiny trial was held by a special court in Rangamati in November.
