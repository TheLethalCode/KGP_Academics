 Dhaka, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com)  The government has started procuring vehicles for all upazila council chairmen of the country, the local government and rural development minister said on Wednesday. "The process has begun to procure 481 vehicles for the upazila chairmen," minister Syed Ashraful Islam told a conference of Upazila Parishad Association, a forum of the upazila chairmen and vice-chairmen, at the National Press Club. He said 61 vehicles have already arrived in Bangladesh and the chairmen will be given the vehicles in phases. Ashraful warned against any irregularities and corruption in procuring the vehicles for the chairmen. The conference raised problems being faced by upazila chairmen and vice-chairmen as administrators of the local government tier. The minister said the government is thinking of increasing allowances of the upazila officials. He said the present government wants to make the upazila parishads, or councils, independent and strong institutions. "That is why amendments are being made to the law (Upazila Parishad Act, 2009)." The prime minister's special assistant Mahbubul Alam Hanif, among others, addressed the conference, presided over by association president Harun-ar Rashid Howlader. b
