 Chittagong, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com)--The first day of the talks between Bangladesh and Myanmar to dissolve disputes over maritime boundary ended on Friday. The delegations will meet again on Saturday. "We discussed the processes of delineating maritime boundary," Md Khurshid Alam, additional foreign secretary heading the Bangladesh delegation, told reporters after the first day's meeting at around 2pm. In the meeting, Bangladesh emphasised the principle of equity process while Myanmar wanted acceptance of the principle of equal distance, he said. The two-day meeting began at Hotel Agrabad in the port city at 9:30am with Maung Myint heading the 13-member Myanmar delegation. Anup Kumar Chakma, Bangladesh ambassador in Yangon, and U Tse Than U, Myanmar envoy in Bangladesh, are attending the two-nation meeting. This is the first such meeting since Bangladesh in October last year turned to the United Nations arbitration court for resolving the dispute over water territory in the Bay of Bengal with Myanmar and India. At the same time, Bangladesh made it known that options for bilateral discussions and settlement would remain open. Foreign ministry officials say Bangladesh, India and Myanmar cannot exploit the full benefits of their oil and gas reserves in the Bay due to claim and counter-claim of the offshore blocks. Out of Bangladesh's total 27, Myanmar and India have made overlapping claims over at least 18 offshore blocks in the complicated maritime geography. Indian and Myanmar claim, what foreign minister Dipu Moni termed as "aggressive", that those would make block Bangladesh's sea zone. Bangladesh and Myanmar resumed talks on maritime boundary demarcation in 2008 after a pause of 22 years. The two countries had at least three rounds of talks on the issue since then and the talks yielded no tangible result. The two countries could not even agree on determining the starting point of the boundary demarcation. On Oct 8 last year, Bangladesh appealed to the UN tribunal for arbitration to end the maritime boundary disputes with Myanmar and India. Foreign minister Dipu Moni on Oct 8 said the government approached to the UN tribunal to end the disputes as soon as possible. She said the disputes would be resolved at the tribunal in maximum four years if Bangladesh could not bury the disputes through bilateral talks. bdnews2
