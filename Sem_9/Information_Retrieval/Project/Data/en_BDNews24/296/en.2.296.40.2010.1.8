 Dhaka, Jan 08 (bdnews24.com)  The Dhaka International Trade Fair has gained momentum with rush of weekend visitors overcoming a sluggish trend in the initial days. The month-long trade fair, inaugurated by prime minister Sheikh Hasina in Jan 01, was experiencing low sales and fewer visitors. Nurul Amin Chowdhury, a director of Wega Zone Ltd that won fair's ticket selling rights, said that during the last week, the number of visitors at the country's largest fair was not as expected. He told bdnews24.com at the fairground on Friday morning that "On an average, 40,000-45,000 visitors entered the fair a day in the past week. But, there is a rush of visitors today. We are expecting around 150,000-200,000 people to visit the fair today." Wega Zone Ltd purchased the ticket selling rights at a cost of Tk23.8 million from the organiser, the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB). Amin expects total of 4.0-4.5 million visitors in the fair this month. EPB's fairground inspector, M Khalequzzaman Khaleq said, "The number of visitors is normally low in the starting week. Other than that, there is low temperature. But, sales is better this time." Observation of the fairground on Friday revealed crowds of people in home and foreign stalls. There were also long queues at the ticket counters. Representatives of the participating organisations also said that the fair has started gaining its natural hubbub on Friday despite the low sales and number of visitors in the past week. But many visitors expressed their dissatisfaction at the prices of products on sale in the fair. Humayun Kabir, a visitor, said, "There is less dust on the ground, better toilet and car parking facilities. But many stalls are overcharging people." Visitors also complained about higher prices of food items. The stall keepers are taking nearly double the normal price and were seen charging Tk 20 for a Tk 10 half-litre mineral water bottle and Tk 250 for a plate of Biryani, which normally costs Tk 120. The fair has a total of 486 stalls and pavilions. Products of 10 countries like UK, China, India, Pakistan, Malaysia and are others have been put on display at the fair. Bangladeshi products are on sale in many stalls. Commerce minister Faruk Khan earlier hoped the fair this year will overcome the two-year trend of declining export orders. He said at a press meet on the fairgrounds on Dec 28 that "Export orders will rise this time." Export orders from the fair in 2006 amounted to Tk 24.68 crore. But they shrunk to Tk 22.6 crore in 2008 and Tk 19.91 crore in 2009. The Export Promotion Bureau is also forecasting Tk 13.82 crore in earnings from the fair, against expenses of Tk 8.56 crore. bd
