 Dhaka, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com)  A devastating fire burned down at least 120 shanties in a city slum on Firday, leaving 1,000 homeless. Fire-fighting vehicles were dispatched as the fire broke out at Dipikar Mor slum at south Begunbari around 6pm. Fire fighters brought it under control just after 8:15pm. There was no reports of fatalities, but some received burn injuries. Abdur Rashid, deputy director of Dhaka Division Fire Service and Civil Defence, said, "The fire spread to the slum following explosion of a gas cylinder at a nearby building." The fire first destroyed adjacent tin-roofed brick houses and then spread to clusters of bamboo huts. Nineteen fire-fighting engines were engaged in dousing the fire. bdnews24.com
