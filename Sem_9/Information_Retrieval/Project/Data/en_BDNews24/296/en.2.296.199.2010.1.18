 Dhaka, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com)  The cabinet has approved a new telecom policy that will allow companies and individuals to run multiple telecom businesses in a bid to stop illegal VoIP activity. The approval on Monday of the International Long Distance Telecommunications Service Policy (Amendment) 2009 means allowing operators to hold licences in more than one category. Telecom secretary Sunil Kanti Bose told bdnews24.com: "Any individual or company will be able to get license for call termination." The move will open up legal Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) operations and is expected increase government revenue from the telecom sector. Currently just four companies are allowed to provide VoIP services in Bangladesh. The parliamentary standing committee on the telecoms ministry in April last year had recommended further opening up of VoIP to stop illegal activity and raise government earnings. The cabinet gave approval to the new policy on Monday with prime minister Sheikh Hasina in the chair. The prime minister's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad briefing reporters said the government wants to open up the telecommunications sector for all. "That's why the cabinet has approved the draft policy amending the previous regulations to allow licences in more than one telecom category," he said. The press secretary said illegal VoIP had spread because of limited licencing. The cabinet meeting also adopted a condolence message for the death of Jyoti Basu. It also approved handover of coastal land for preservation of forests and forestation. "The proposal has been approved to curb occupation of forestland and illegal logging." bd
