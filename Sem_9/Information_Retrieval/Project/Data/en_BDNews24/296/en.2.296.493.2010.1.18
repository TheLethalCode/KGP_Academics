 Dhaka, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com)Ruling Awami League on Monday condemned the statement of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia on the prime minister's visit to India, terming it "absolute propaganda" and "information terrorism". Khaleda, in a televised press conference on Sunday, said Sheikh Hasina "brought nothing back" from her recently-concluded tour of India. She said the visit has been successful for India, not for Bangladesh. The opposition leader said far from benefiting Bangladesh, the prime minister's visit had harmed national interests. "What she said was false and provocative aiming to create hatred and spite among people," Awami League general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam told a press conference at the party chairperson's political office in Dhanmondi. "Khaleda Zia and BNP show their inherent communal spite, blind opposition to India and Pakistani mentality. They resorted to a ploy to divert people's attention to another side from basic issues to non-basic ones." He also termed Khaleda's 'sell-out country' allegation as 'chronic disease' and said, "They frequently speak about the sell-out of the country." "Is it acceptable from any responsible politician to raise allegations of selling out the country compromising with its sovereignty?" He dismissed the allegation that Hasina struck a secret security deal with India and said, "Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has not struck, will never strike any secret deal or understanding not only with India, but also any other country in the world." Holding up Awami League's election manifesto at the press conference, he said, "We went to elections with this manifesto. People knowingly cast their votes for us." "This is now people's mainstay. We will take any steps in the interests of the nation." Calling on the countrymen to stand guard against any ominous force, he pointed to the opposition party and said, "The countrymen are with us." Foreign minister Dipu Moni and prime minister's adviser HT Imam were present at the conference among others who had accompanied Hasina on her state visit to India. "The government does not run like the opposition party which relies only on statements. The government has to take all possible and realistic steps to resolve the country's problems," said Ashraf, who is also a cabinet member. "We believe Begum Zia and BNP-Jamaat alliance do not want the unsettled issues with India solved. They want to serve their dishonest political interests through making people against India by keeping alive the problems." Ashraf said BNP was working with three intentions: opposing India, resisting execution of the Bangabandhu murder verdict and preventing war crime trials. "With these in mind, they are intending to create anarchy in the country," he said. BNP was "intending to gang together with other anti-national groups" such as war criminals and terrorists, he said, citing Al-Badr and Razakar, ULFA and HuJi. In answering to a reporter's question, he said: "We want India, Bhutan, Nepal and China to use Mongla and Chittagong ports. We want to connect with all. We also want to build a deep seaport, which will not be effective unless our existing ports are opened up." Ashraf said he proposed a road and rail route from Kunming in China to Chittagong via Myanmar during a recentl visit to Beijing. "The prime minister will go to China next and an understanding will be reached." On a possible extradition treaty with India, he said "Marked criminals and Bangabandhu killers are in various jails in India. This treaty needs to bring them back home." He also added: "Indian terrorists hiding out in Bangladesh have surrendered to Indian forces with our encouragement. We shall further encourage such action so that they return home." bdnew
