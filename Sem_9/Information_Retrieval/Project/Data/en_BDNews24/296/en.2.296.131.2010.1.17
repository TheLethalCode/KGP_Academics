 By Liton Haider and Mohosinul Karim Dhaka, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com)--Jamuna Group chairman Nurul Islam Babul has said the government orders on Jamuna Future Park project to pull down illegal storeys is an act of vengeance of the state minister for public works. But Abdul Mannan Khan, the minister, has dismissed the accusation, saying it goes against his taste to respond to Babul's remarks. City development authority Rajuk served notice Sunday on the Future Park project for violation of the building plan, giving them a week to knock down the illegal floors erected beyond the approved height. "We've sent a letter today to owners of the Future Park asking them to demolish the unauthorised storeys of the project," Rajuk development and planning director Sheikh Abdul Mannan told bdnews24.com on Sunday. He said Rajuk authorised construction up to six floors for the project located at Basundhara, Baridhara, that Jamuna Group claims will be one of the biggest shopping and entertainment complexes in the region. However, the developers have built the structure up to 10 floors. Jamuna Future Park is scheduled to open at the year-end. One estimate in 2008 put the project of cost at more than Tk 2,000 crore. Rajuk first expressed its reservations about the installation in a Jan 13 letter. Rajuk chairman Nurul Huda told bdnews24.com that they had decided last week to order demolition of all unauthorised buildings and structures in the city. Jamuna Group chief Babul, who also owns Bengali Daily Jugantor, said: "No construction has been done in an unauthorised manner here. We were given approval to construct up to seven floors. The approval said Rajuk would inspect any further construction beyond seven floors. We have constructed the whole under the supervision of Rajuk." Babul claimed: "But I received a letter on this matter on January 13, which is an outburst of personal outrage, as a report was recently published (in Jugantor) on the corruption of the state minister for housing and establishment." "The letter ordered demolition of structures erected beyond seven storeys. I filed a writ petition in the High Court. The court served show cause notices on the relevant officials including the minister. "For this reason, rumours are deliberately being spread about the Jamuna Future Park." But minister Khan told bdnews24.com: "I have no connection with the notice Rajuk served on Jamuna Future Park. The question of demolition would not arise if there was no unauthorised construction." "But if there are any illegal installations, no-one, however big he is, will be able to prevent them being pulled down," he said. On Babul's allegation against him, the state minister said, "I have no desire to say anything about such people. Everyone knows his reputation in the business community." bdnews24.
