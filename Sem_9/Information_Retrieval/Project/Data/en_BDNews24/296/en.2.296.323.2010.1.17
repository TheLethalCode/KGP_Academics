 Dhaka, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com)The government is contemplating raining allowances for freedom fighters by Tk 500 and reducing the frequency . State minister for liberation war affairs A B Tajul Islam told parliament on Sunday that the allowance would be raised to Tk 2,000 per month from Tk 1,500 and given every three months instead of current six months. The minister disclosed the plans replying to a question from Mohammed Shahab Uddin, an Awami League MP elected from a Moulvibazar constituency. "Now we provide the allowance every six months through the social welfare department as the ministry has no office at the upazilla level," Islam said replying to the notice on public importance. Islam said since the amount of the allowance was 'very meager", the freedom fighters would spend it easily. "Therefore, we decided to give the allowance after every six months so that they can get a big amount together," he said, explaining the previous move. He said prime minister Sheikh Hasina had already given her consent to a hike in the allowance.
