 Dhaka, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com)Two pleas have been made to defer for eight weeks the hearing on two leaves to appeal seeking a stay order on the 2005 High Court judgment declaring the Fifth Amendment to the constitution illegal. The Appellate Division is scheduled to hear on Monday the leaves to appeal BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain and three Jamaat-e-Islami-backed lawyers Munshi Ahsan Kabir, Tajul Islam and Kamruzzaman Bhuiyan had filed. TH Khan and barrister Abdur Razzak on Sunday filed the petitions on behalf of Delwar and three lawyers seeking more time to prepare for the hearing. The Supreme Court earlier this month lifted a stay order on the High Court ruling as the government was allowed to withdraw a previous leave to appeal seeking to challenge the ruling. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam had told the media that with the withdrawal of the leaves to appeal and vacation of the existing stay order, the High Court ruling was upheld, for now. The High Court gave the ruling in August 2005 in response to a petition challenging the legality of a Marshal Law Regulation of 1977. In its ruling, the High Court declared regimes between Aug 15, 1975 and 1979, headed by Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed, Abu Sa'dat Mohammad Sayem and Ziaur Rahman illegal. The petition on which the ruling was given had been filed by an individual who claimed that his ownership of the Moon Cinema Hall had been expropriated by dint of the amendment that had legalsied all the regimes between 1975 to 1979. The Fifth Amendment was meant to provide constitutional legitimacy to the governments in powermilitary or otherwiseafter the assassination of president and independence hero 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1975. In 2005, an alliance government led by BNP which was floated with the backing of General Ziaur Rahman, filed a leave to appeal on which the Supreme Court had stayed the High Court ruling. But the incumbent government in May 2009 petitioned the court for withdrawal of that leave to appeal, a legal term for permission from court to file petition. b
