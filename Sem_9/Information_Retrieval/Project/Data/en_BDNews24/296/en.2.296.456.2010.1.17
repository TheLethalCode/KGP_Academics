 Dhaka, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com)  People of Chittagong are afraid of BNP leader Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury for his role in 1971 liberation war and alleged involvement in the 2004 Chittagong arm smuggling case, state minister for environment Hasan Mahmud said on Sunday. His comment came in reaction to Chowdhury's observation on Friday that Chittagong people feel a sense of insecurity, as prime minister Sheikh Hasina had put Bangladesh's security at risk by agreeing to allow India's use of Bangladesh's ports during her recent trip to the neighbouring country. Talking to reporters at his secretariat office on Sunday, Mahmud, who defeated Chowdhury in the 2008 general election in Rangunia constituency, said: "Actually Chittagong people are afraid of Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury. Many an eminent person had to leave this world in 1971 due to him." Referring to the ongoing investigation into the 2004 '10-truck arms' seizure, and hinting at Chowdhury's involvement, Mahmud said: "The probe will reveal who were involved in the incident." Chowdhury, who was elected a member of parliament from Fatikchhari constituency and is now a newly inducted member of the BNP's centre-right working committee, told reporters at his Chittagong residence Friday warned of a "strong people's movement to save the port from such an evil force as India". Mamhud said of the warning: "The government is always trying to maintain law and order. It (government) will not be sitting idle if anybody threatens the law and order situation. They will be dealt with as per law." Referring to BNP and Chowdhury's anti-Indian stand, he said: "They pursue anti-Indian politics to misguide the people." The state minister said BNP is against allowing use of Chittagong and Mongla as regional seaports, as the party does not want the country attains economic development through ensuring their best use. "Bangladesh will benefit the most from the use of Chittagong as a regional port and Chittagong people will be the first to tap the benefit," he said. He said allowing the use of the two ports as regional ones would substantially raise the revenue income for them and double the economic activities in the two regions. The prime minister during her 10-13 January visit to India agreed to allow the close neighbour to use Chittagong and Mongla port. Mahmud criticised BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia for her refusal to be connected to the submarine cable network in 1991, when she was the prime minister, on the plea of security. "The refusal held the country back for 10 years." bd
