 Dhaka, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina departed Dhaka for Kolkata Tuesday morning to attend the funeral of Indian communist patriarch Jyoti Basu, whose ancestral home was in Sonargaon, near Dhaka. Basu, who was chief minister of West Bengal for 23 years from 1977, will be given state honours and a gun salute on his last journey before his body is given to a hospital in Kolkata for medical research. Congress president Sonia Gandhi will attend the funeral among a host of dignitaries, while thousands and thousands of ordinary people are expected to pay last respects to the legendary Marxist leader who died on Sunday at the age of 95. Indian media reported that the body will be first taken from the funeral home to the party headquarters at 31 Alimuddin Street. From there it will be carried to the state secretariat for the chief minister and the chief secretary to pay their last respects. The body will then be laid at the State Assembly for the public to pay their respects. Basu's body will then be placed in a gun carriage and army pall bearers will lead a procession to Citizens Park, where state police will offer a gun salute to the former chief minister before handing his body over to SSKM Hospital. Hasina, leading a 13-member delegation, departed Dhaka by a BAF aircraft at 11:30am, half an hour later than scheduled amid some of the heaviest fog of the winter. West Bengal governor MK Narayanan will receive the prime minister on her arrival in Kolkata. From there she will go straight to the funeral. After paying her last respects to Basu, Hasina will take lunch at Hotel Taj Bengal and is scheduled to return to Dhaka in the afternoon. Among those accompanying Hasina are foreign minister Dipu Moni, local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam and industries minister Dilip Barua. Ruling alliance members Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad, JSD president Hasanul Haque Inu and Workers Party president Rashed Khan Menon are also among the delegation.
