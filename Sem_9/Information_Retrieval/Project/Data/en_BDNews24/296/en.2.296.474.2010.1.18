<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com)-- Jyoti Basu had always a sympathetic consideration for Bangladesh in dealing with any bilateral problems between India and Bangladesh, the president of Bangladesh National Awami Party (NAP) says. In an exclusive interview with bdnews24.com at his home, Mozaffar Ahmed said Basu used to lend his advice to Bangladesh during the country's war of liberation in 1971. "Jyoti Babu was a source of inspiration for us even after our independence," he said. The ancestral home of legendary Marxist leader was at Barodi village in Narayanganj district though he was born at a residence on Harrison Road (now known as Mahatma Gandhi Road) in Calcutta on July 8, 1914. Basu visited Barodi with his parents several times in his early boyhood. He came to Bangladesh for the last time in 1996 during the Awami League government's rule. Ahmed said Basu had come to Barodi in his mother's lap and though he stopped visiting Barodi after partition of India in 1947, he could never forget this little village in Bangladesh. He along with his wife visited Barodi in March 1, 1987, he recalled. "I cannot forget Barodi even when I perform state duty. I feel like returning to Barodi," Mozaffar quoted Basu as having once said. The NAP leader said emphatically, "Jyoti Basu always thought of Bangladesh and he would spare time with someone from Bangladesh who called on him and enquired about Bangladesh." Mozaffar said, "It seems exaggerated to talk about Jyoti Basu as there is hardly any politically conscious person not only in the Indian subcontinent but also across the world who does not know about him." Jyoti Basu was a shining star in the firmament of leftist movement, he said, adding that in his death, the leftist political quarters have lost a devoted guardian. Recalling his contributions to Bangladesh politics, he said, "Jyoti Basu gave valuable advice during our independence war and even did not hesitate to advise us at times of our national crises." He always had sympathy for Bangladesh during bilateral talk between India and Bangladesh, he said, adding that if he were alive, he would stand by the Bangladesh leadership with his good advice. Leftist politician Haidar Akbar Khan Rono said, "I saw Jyoti Basu attend meetings at my grandfather's house when I visited there in my school days." "I contacted him directly during our independence war after we, some left leaders of Bangladesh, had formed the National Liberation Movement Committee," he said. "I talked to Basu over our war strategy He assured us of all types of assistance except supplying of arms which was a matter for the Indian central government," Rono said. While reminiscing, he said, "In August 1971, Indian military intelligence agency captured me and shifted me to Shillong where an army officer named Subranium interrogated me," Rono said, "On hearing the incident, Jyoti Babu encouraged me saying that a revolutionist had to overcome many such oddities." "We accorded a reception to Jyoti Basu when he visited Dhaka in 1996," he said. "We arranged a dinner for him at Dhaka Club which awarded him a lifelong membership," he recalled. Rono said that he had called on Jyoti Babu at her Salt Lake home last time in 2006. "Dressed in a lungi and panjabi, he talked to me for nearly twenty minutes," he said. Rono termed Basu's death is an irreparable loss not only for Indian democratic and communist movement but also for the entire left politics across the world. bdne
