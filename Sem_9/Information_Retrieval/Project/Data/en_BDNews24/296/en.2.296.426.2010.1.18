 Dhaka, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com)--Information minister Abul Kalam Azad on Monday revealed in parliament that more than Tk 19.35 crores were misused for the forestalled Jan 22, 2006 national polls. The minister, while answering a written query from Naogaon-6 MP Md Israfil Ahmed, also accused former chief election commissioner M A Aziz of presiding over the abuse of the huge money. He also said that field level workers of the EC should not be held responsible for the expenditure as it was done at the orders of the Election Commission. The Naogaon MP requested Azad to inform the deputies on the exact amount of money spent on the preparatory process for the planned 'farcical', 'conspiratorial' and 'anti-people' election. He also wanted to know the sectors where that money had been spent and process of the expenditure. A total of Tk 59.96 crore were allocated for the ninth parliamentary polls which was announced to be held on Jan 22, 2006, the minister said, adding the EC returned Tk 40.81 crore.
