 Dhaka, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina will attend the funeral of Indian communist patriarch Jyoti Basu in Kolkata on Tuesday. Hasina will depart at 11:30am and return the same day, senior officials said on Monday. Basu, who was chief minister of West Bengal for 23 years from 1977, died on Sunday, aged 95. The veteran Marxist leader, whose ancestral home is at Sonargaon in Narayanganj, near Dhaka, was critically ill during Hasina's Jan 10-13 India tour. She had voiced her concern over the deteriorating health of the ailing leader. The prime minister was originally scheduled to go to West Bengal during her visit, to meet the ailing Basu in Kolkata and also to visit Vishwa Bharati at Shantiniketan. But she returned home after visiting Delhi and Ajmer, missing out West Bengal, due to a change in plans. bdne
