 Dhaka, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com)  A record-breaking opening stand between Upul Tharanga and Mahela Jayawardene consigned Bangladesh to a third successive defeat in the Idea Cup tri-series at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Friday. Chasing a modest Bangladesh total of 249-9 in 50 overs, the islanders reached their target-- 252-- with 43 balls to spare and nine wickets in hand. Man-of-the-match Tharanga carried his bat (126-ball 118) while his skipper Kumar Sangakkara was not out on 17. The result meant Sri Lanka qualified for the Jan 13 final with a match in hand. The story of the game was the Tharanga-Jayawardene partnership that produced a record 215 runs  the highest by any country against Bangladesh in Bangladesh. Despite seven bowlers being used by the hosts, nothing was able to separate the pair. Jaywardene was the first to get to the milestone with a square cut off left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak in the 36th over. When it looked like Sri Lanka were heading for a 10-wicket win, Naeem Islam induced an edge from Jayawardene in the 38th over who walked after making 108 off 117 balls with 13 fours. Tharanga, who was bogged down in nervous ninties, eventually brought up his third century against Bangladesh with a powerful drive off Shakib. It came after facing 115 balls. Bangladesh's only solace was Shakib being able to bowl the first maiden over. In fact, he should have had Tharanga caught behind on 97 but wicketketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim failed to hold on to a big inside edge. Earlier, the hosts lost three wickets for eight runs and five wickets in powerplays after Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim and Naeem Islam fell in quick succession to deny themselves a third straight 250 total against a Test-playing nation. Shakib was holding the innings together until he was caught in the deep on 47, Mushfiq (22-ball 32) entertained the crowd before chancing his arm once too often and was taken at mid-off while charging the spinner and Naeem was yorked for 5. The Tigers had to rely on a 77-run fourth wicket stand between Shakib and Raqibul Hasan, who fell for 43, to give the total any substance. They came together with the score on 88 after Bangladesh lost two quick wickets. For 10 overs neither Shakib nor Raqibul had managed to score a boundary. A well-set Imrul Kayes was adjudged lbw for 42 after Mohammad Ashraful was run out for 13 attempting a second run with score on 72 in the 14th over from a direct hit of Thilan Thushara at third man. The hosts made a brisk start after Kumar Sangakkara won the toss and sent the Tigers in to bat. Tamim Iqbal and Imrul Kayes made 44 runs in the opening stand before Tamim was out when spin was introduced. He was adjudged lbw trying to sweep spinner Suraj Randiv for 21 that included a six and two fours in the 22-ball knock. Bangladesh lost to India by six wickets in their second match. The games have been advanced by half an hour to counter the dew factor but it may not make any difference as the dew tends to settle shortly after the second innings commences. Sri Lanka rested fast bowlers Chanaka Welegedara and Suranga Lakmal and off-spinner Muthumudalige Pushpakumara and brought in bowler Nuwan Kulasekara and batsman Mahela Jayawardene and leg-spinner Malinga Bandar
