 WASHINGTON, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Obama administration said on Thursday it plans to make greater use of full-body scanners at airports while it works to develop better aviation security technology and pushes other countries to take similar steps. "There's no silver bullet to securing the thousands of flights into America each day, domestic and international. It will require significant investments in many areas," President Barack Obama said in announcing a range of new steps to tighten overall aviation security in response to the failed attempt to blow up a US jetliner heading for Detroit on Christmas Day. Security officials say current screening technology and other strategies used at airports cannot catch all threats and the administration is pledging to develop and deploy better tools, especially in the area of explosives detection. Three major security scares for the United States since the September 11, 2001 hijack attacks -- the failed "shoe bomber" later that year, a threat authorities said was in the planning stages before being disrupted overseas in 2006 and the incident two weeks ago -- involved plots to blow up passenger planes. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told a news conference after Obama's remarks the government will accelerate plans for using full body-scanners, technology that uses radio waves to project a three-dimensional body image and reveal items hidden under clothing. Napolitano said homeland security officials will also partner with Energy Department experts to develop the next generation of technologies for aviation security. In addition, the administration is beefing up its force of undercover air marshals on commercial flights, she said. There are 40 full-body scanners in place at U.S. airports and the government has purchased another 150 in 2009 from L-3 Communications Holdings Inc and Rapiscan Systems Inc. Costs for each range between $130,000 and $170,000. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) hopes to purchase another 300 scanners through competitively bidding. The administration stressed that aviation security is an international responsibility, especially in light of the Detroit incident. The Nigerian accused of attempting to blow up the Detroit-bound flight boarded in Amsterdam. "The Christmas Day incident underscored that the screening procedures at foreign airports are critical to our safety here in the United States," Napolitano said. "Therefore, we have to do all that we can do to encourage foreign authorities to utilize the same enhanced technologies for aviation security," she said. Napolitano said US security officials have been meeting with international counterparts to push for tighter airport security. She plans to travel to Spain for a meeting with European authorities intended to be the first in a series of efforts to develop new aviation security standards. Amsterdam operator Schiphol Group's reputation was dented after the incident. The company said this week it would buy 60 body scanners and denied allegations of lax security. Shares of imaging companies like American Science and Engineering, OSI Systems, and ICx Technologies Inc have been buoyed by speculation that the Detroit incident could spawn orders for scanning products. New rules put in place by the Obama administration on Monday require extra security screening for US-bound travelers from Nigeria, Yemen, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia and nine other countries. The rules also mandate random screening and other security enhancements for passengers heading to the United States from all other countr
