<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com)--Parliament on Sunday mourned the death of former West Bengal chief minister Jyoti Basu with a one-minute silence in his honour. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina, finance minister AMA Muhith, industry minister Dilip Barua, senior Awami League leaders Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed, Suranjit Sengupta and Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, JSD chief Hasanul Huq Inu, chief whip Abdus Shahid, Fazle Rabbi Miah and Jatiya Party's ABM Ruhul Amin Howlader spoke on the condolence resolution. Hasina expressed deep condolence and conveyed sympathies to the members of the bereaved family in her speech. "It is a day of mourning for this sub-continent. He was not only an elderly politician, but also the guardian in the field of politics. India has lost a great politician in his demise, Bangladesh a well-wisher and I have personally lost a guardian." Hasina told parliament that Basu's ancestral home in Narayanganj would be turned into a library according to his wish. The prime minister recalled his contribution to Bangladesh's independence war and said: "Whenever danger came, he stood by us. Because of him, we got fair share in Ganges waters and the Chittagong Hill Tracts accord was signed." Highlighting the patriarch of Indian communism's role even before the Ganges accord, Hasina said, "He faced much inconvenience over the water issue. It created inconvenience for his election and also for his voters. "But whenever he heard Bangladesh is facing desertification for lack of water, he came to our support. It would have been difficult to have fair share in Ganges waters without his support." "Jyoti Basu enquired about me when I was a prisoner. Even he enquired about me from my sister Rehana. Whenever opportunity came to him, he told the Indian government to be active in respect of Bangladesh. "He mentioned me according to his convenience. I was to go there to see him. I will go there to pay my last respects to him." Calling Basu 'a great man of Asia', Muhith said, "He was an outstanding leader of the communist movement in India. He never fell behind to take a stand for the party. He reformed the communist movement and his reforms need emulation." Tofail said, "Jyoti Basu was at heart a Bengali. He dedicated his life to the working people. Former water resources and irrigation minister Razzak termed Basu a great leader of the sub-continent. "His contribution to peace in this region cannot be forgotten. Ganges water treaty would not have been possible without him. He had regard for Bangabandhu (Sheikh Mujibur Rahman)." Suranjit said the former West Bengal chief minister was the guardian of this sub-continent: "His demise means the fall of a star. He was a revolutionary and at the same time, a saviour of parliamentary democracy in West Bengal. He was our son. He was the symbol of idealism, honesty and patriotism." JSD chief Inu said, "He was the leader of the oppressed people. He has not only helped us during the war of liberation, but also helped the Indian government in taking strong role. He was a guardian of the Bengalis... In his death, Bangladesh has lost a real friend." Barua, also Samyabadi Dal leader, said: "He was at the forefront of the communist movement. He had enormous contribution to the signing of the Ganges water treaty. The Bengali people will remember him for the way he extended support to our liberation war. Mainuddin Khan Badal, working president of JSD, said," He was the symbol of democracy and idealism".
