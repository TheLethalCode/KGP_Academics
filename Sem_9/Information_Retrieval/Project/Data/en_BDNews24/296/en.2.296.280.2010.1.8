 LONDON, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester City have completed the signing of French midfielder Patrick Vieira from Inter Milan on a six-month contract with an option for a further year, the Premier League club said on Friday. The former Arsenal player, 33, is Roberto Mancini's first signing since taking over as coach at City last month. "Patrick is a world class midfielder with a winner's mentality and will fit into this group very well," Mancini told the City website (www.mcfc.co.uk). "He knows me and my staff well, and importantly he also knows what the Premier League is all about. He will not need much time to settle in." The imposing Frenchman won three Serie A titles with Inter, including two under the guidance of Mancini, to add to the three Premier League titles he won with Arsenal. "For me has had made the right choice, City have made the right choice -- it should be a good marriage," Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, who signed Vieira in 1996, told Sky Sports. He moves in search of regular first-team action in a bid to win a place in the France squad for June's World Cup finals in South Africa -- a move Les Bleus manager Raymond Domenech has welcomed. "If he plays and if he plays at his true level, there is no reason why he shouldn't come to South Africa," Domenech told French sports daily L'Equipe. A 1998 World Cup and 2000 European Championship winner, he has not played for France in a competitive match since September 2007 in a Euro 2008 qualifier against Scotland. Vieira, whose contract at Serie A leaders Inter was due to expire at the end of the season, made his final appearance in Wednesday's 1-0 win at Chievo Verona. "Patrick is one of the great players of his era with almost every honour in the game against his name. I am sure City fans will welcome him warmly and appreciate the contribution he will make," Mancini said. He will take the number 24 shirt and could make his debut against Blackburn Rovers on Monday at Eastlands.
