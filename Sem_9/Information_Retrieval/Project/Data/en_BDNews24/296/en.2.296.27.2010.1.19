 TOKYO, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japanese prosecutors on Tuesday widened their probe into a funding scandal embroiling the ruling party's powerful No.2, Ichiro Ozawa, and jolting the government ahead of a mid-year election, media reported. The funding scandal, which is adding to political uncertainty weighing on investor sentiment, could delay enactment of an extra budget aimed at bolstering the fragile economy. The affair has also eroded voter support for Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama's government in surveys ahead of the upper house election, in which the ruling Democratic Party wants to win a majority so they can pass legislation smoothly.

Ozawa has vowed to stay in his post, but some analysts said it was only a question of time before he had to step down. "Ozawa may think that he is fighting the prosecutors, but many other people are primarily fighting public perceptions," said Koichi Nakano, a professor at Tokyo's Sophia University. "I think that sooner or later, Ozawa would have to step down. The question is, in what form? He could become another 'shadow shogun'," he added, referring to Ozawa's penchant for running things from behind the scenes.
