 TOKYO, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan and the United States reaffirmed their five-decade security alliance on Tuesday, vowing to expand ties into new areas even as they squabble over the relocation of a US Marine base. They will work with China and also jointly deal with North Korea's nuclear and missile threats, the two countries' foreign and defence ministers said in a statement to mark the 50th anniversary of the US-Japan security treaty.

A delay in the decision could hurt Hatoyama's ratings which have suffered from doubts about his leadership ability. The two sides are just beginning to work on defining a new direction for the alliance, which could include tighter links in intelligence and missile defence but also cooperation in non-security areas such as fighting global warming. Hatoyama said on Tuesday he wants to have visible results by the end of the year from the ta
