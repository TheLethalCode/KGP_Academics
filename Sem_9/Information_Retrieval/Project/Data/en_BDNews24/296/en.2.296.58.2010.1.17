 Dhaka, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson and leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia, in a televised press conference on Sunday, said prime minister Sheikh Hasina "brought nothing back" from her recently-concluded tour of India. Khaleda said the visit has been successful for India, not for Bangladesh. She said far from benefiting Bangladesh, the prime minister's visit had harmed national interests. She dismissed the trip as a "total sell-out" and said the deals signed between Bangladesh and India during Hasina's visit "left the people in the dark". Khaleda was holding a press conference at her Gulshan office on Sunday, to spell out the opposition's reaction to the outcome of the prime minister's January 10-13 India tour. "Everything Bangladesh had to offer, it handed to India on this visit," two-time former prime minister Khaleda said, as senior party leaders, including BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, other standing committee and advisory committee members, sat in attendance behind her. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina just 24 hours before had strongly defended the outcome of her visit, tackling some of the criticisms that have been aired by the opposition since her return, at a formal press briefing for the media and public, the first of its kind to be attended by scores of senior journalists and televised live from the Prime Minister's Office. Staged by the fountain at front of the Prime Minister's Office, Hasina's briefing saw a huge turnout by ruling party and alliance members in a show of support for the "success" of her India tour, which the opposition alliance has repeatedly called a "total failure". The prime minister at the press conference also urged the opposition to return to parliament and place their criticisms in the House. Hasina on return from India had said her visit marked the start of a new era of cooperation between the two neighbours. Critics, mainly the opposition BNP, have said Bangladesh gained no more than vague assurances while India secured concrete gains. The prime minister returned home on January 13 after a four-day visit to the neighboring country. Bangladesh and India on Jan 11 signed three agreements on combating crime and two MoUs on power cooperation and cultural exchange, among other bilateral arrangements. Progress was made on connectivity, including corridors for Bangladesh to Bhutan and Nepal, use of Mongla and Chittagong ports by India and joint rail and other infrastructure projects with major Indian assistance. The use of ports by India has been one of the arrangements most criticised by the opposition who see a threat to Bangladesh's "sovereignty". Khaleda on Sunday contradicted Hasina's argument that Chittagong and Mongla ports were underutilised and allowing India to use them would ensure full use of their capacity and bring enormous benefits. The opposition leader also criticised what she termed as the prime minister's "indifference" to the Tipaimukh dam issue. She said the joint statement released during Hasina's visit suggested that she had sold out the interests of the country to India and given a green signal to carry on the Tipamukh dam project. Hasina has said her Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh assured that Bangladesh's interests would not be harmed by India's planned dam, while, according to at least two members of the Hasina's entourage to India, New Delhi has said all work on the dam will be stopped. bdn
