 Chittagong, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com)--Bad light forced an early end to the second day's play in the first Test between Bangladesh and India at the Zohur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium in Chittagong on Monday. Bangladesh were 59-3 at stumps with Mohammad Ashraful (0) and Raqibul Hasan (1) batting. India were dismissed before lunch for 243 in their first innings. After an initial inspection at 16:20pm, umpires decided to officially call it a day 20 minutes later after consulting the match referee.

India, resuming the second morning on 213-8, owed their final total to Sachin Tendulkar who carried his bat to remain 105 not out off 166 balls with 11 fours and two sixes. It was the batting maestro's 44th Test century, and 89th in internationals. It was also his fourth hundred against Bangladesh. Tendulkar scored 29 of the 30 runs India managed manoeuvring the strike well and adding some respectability to the tourists' total. Both Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan and Shahadat Hossain reached five-fors - it was Shakib's sixth in 15 Tests and Shahadat's third. Shakib finished with 5-62 while Shahadat
