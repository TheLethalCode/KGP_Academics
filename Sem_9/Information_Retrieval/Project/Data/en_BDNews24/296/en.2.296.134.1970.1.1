<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com)Under fire from deputies, the state minister for health has told parliament that his ministry would investigate allegations of 'unnecessary' amputation of patients at Pangu hospital. Replying to a notice on public importance, served by Awami League MP Nurul Islam (BSc), Mujibur Rahman Fakir also said his ministry would try to investigate harassment of patients at the National Institute of Traumatology and Orthopaedics Rehabilitation. Islam, a Chittagong lawmaker, in his notice alleged that amputations of road accident victims had become a regular phenomenon in the hospital. He referred to the harassment of Liakat Ali, who had been injured in a road crash and whose legs the physicians suggested to be cut off. But Ali could save his legs by taking treatment in India. "The incident that the MP has mentioned is not known to the hospital authorities," Fakir told parliament, drawing howls of protests from fellow MPs who started shouting "shame shame". Deputy speaker Shawkat Ali, who was chairing the session, intervened. "Minister, please tell us whether you will investigate the incident, preferably headed by the MP (Nurul Islam),' Ali said. "Yes, honourable speaker. We will investigate," Fakir said after a pause of a few seconds. Nurul Islam in his notice also said seriously injured Liakat Ali had been taken to the hospital at 4.00am on Oct 2 last year. But the attendant washed his injuries at 8:00am and the doctors had come to see him at 3:00pm, 11 hours after his arrival. The poor family members of Liakat bought medicine worth Tk 16,000 for his operation. "Though he did not undergo operation, the syndicate of class three and four employees took away the medicine and harassed his family members," Islam said. "Even the physicians also fall victim to the syndicate," he said in the notice.
