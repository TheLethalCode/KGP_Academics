 Dhaka, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com)  At least 20 people, including police, were injured during an armed battle on Dhaka University campus between two rival groups of Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal over postings to JCD's newly formed committee on Monday. All university classes have been suspended for the day. The fighting JCD groups, one led by the new committee leaders and the other led by a rival group of 'deprived leaders', exploded cocktails and exchanged several rounds of gunfire, police and witnesses said. A group of Bangladesh Chhatra League leaders also became involved in the violence to support the rival group, witnesses said. They were also reportedly armed. Shahbagh police chief Rezaul Karim said his men had to throw several rounds tear shells to bring the situation under control. Leaders of the recently formed JCD committee were obstructed by a rival Chhatra Dal group from entering the campus in the morning, Karim said. Both groups locked in fierce clashes. He said the situation was initially brought under control. Additional police were also deployed on the campus. But the situation exploded again from midmorning. The two JCD groups were also seen to take up positions on the campus. The leaders of the new committee, led by its deputy joint secretary general Obaidul Haque Nasim, were seen to take position in front of Madhu's Canteen, the Arts Faculty and Central Library. The rival group, led by JCD's former DU unit social welfare secretary Ahsan Uddin Khan Shipon, have taken position in the administrative building, Jashimuddin Hall and Surya Sen Hall of the campus. bdnews
