 Spain Jan 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)--The Spanish government want to ban smoking in public places. But smokers and non-smokers disagree with plans forcing them to stub out. Smoking at a restaurant like this one in Spain could soon be a thing of the past. That's if the government have their way. Spanish lawmakers want to stub out the habit in public places like bars and restaurants. But it's an unpopular proposal in a country where around 30 percent of the population smoke.

Even non-smokers don't support the idea. (SOUNDBITE) (Spanish) NON-SMOKER VICTOR SAYING: "I think it's wrong. Wrong. Because it is about freedom and that everybody has to look at it that way. Imposing something, I don't agree with that. I think it has to be voluntary." The country's trade and hotel associations says a full ban will have a negative impact on businesses. (SOUNDBITE) (Spanish) FEHR PRESIDENT, JOSE MARIA RUBIO SAYING: "We should all think about how a measure like this, the complete ban, would change a lifestyle and social relationship like ours, which is envied in all the countries of the world" The government says around 50,000 people die every year due to smoking related illnesses. Doctors welcome the tougher law. (SOUNDBITE) (Spanish) DOCTOR, A.MARTINEZ VERDASCO SAYING: "It respects more the rights of those who don't smoke.

Ireland was the first country in the EU to put the smoking ban into place, that was around six years ago. Spaniards could soon follow suit and be forced to spark up outs
