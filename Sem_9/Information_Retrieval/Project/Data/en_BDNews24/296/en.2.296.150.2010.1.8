 OHANNESBURG, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Left-arm swing bowler Wayne Parnell and leg-spinner Imran Tahir have been added to South Africa's squad for the fourth test against England, Cricket South Africa (CSA) announced on Friday. Parnell, 20, has played nine one-day internationals for his country but has yet to play a test while Tahir, born in Pakistan but now qualified for South Africa through residency, has yet to represent his adopted country in international cricket. The final test of the series starts at the Wanderers in Johannesburg on January 14. The hosts trail England one-nil. "This is a must win test for us and we have covered all our bases as far as the composition of our attack is concerned," South Africa selection convener Mike Procter said in a statement. Tahir, 30, is a well-travelled cricketer who has represented Pakistan A and Middlesex, Yorkshire and Hampshire in the English county championship. He is currently playing for Easterns in South African domestic cricket. Fast bowler Friedel de Wet has been retained in the 15-man squad despite needing a scan on his back after he suffered spasms during the third test in Cape Town. South Africa - Graeme Smith (captain), Hashim Amla, Mark Boucher, AB de Villiers, Friedel de Wet, JP Duminy, Paul Harris, Jacques Kallis, Ryan McLaren, Morne Morkel, Wayne Parnell, Alviro Petersen, Ashwell Prince, Dale Steyn, Imran Ta
