 ANKARA, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak met Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu on Sunday on a mission to mend relations with Turkey after a diplomatic spat between the two allies. Muslim but secular Turkey has a history of military cooperation with Israel and has acted as an intermediary for the Jewish state with the Arab world. But frequent Turkish criticism of Israel's offensive in Palestinian-ruled Gaza a year ago has strained ties and last week Turkey's ambassador was publicly humiliated by the Israeli deputy foreign minister -- an incident for which Ankara demanded and got an apology. "The aim of the visit is to warm up bilateral relations. The Isareli-Turkey alliance is of mutual strategic importance," an aide to Barak said. Barak, a former army general and Israeli premier, met Davutoglu on Sunday after visiting the tomb of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey. Neither party issued a statement afterwards. Barak is also scheduled to meet the Turkish defence minister and hold a news conference later in the day. Absent among the hosts of the day-long visit was Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, whose AK Party's roots lie in political Islam and whose public fury at the hundreds of civilian dead in Gaza left Israel especially aggrieved. Turkey barred Israel from participating in a NATO war exercise late last year because of its public's concerns over the Gaza offensive, which Israel says was launched to stop Hamas rocket attacks. Erdogan has since held high level meetings with the presidents of Syria and Iran, foes of Israel. Turkey's tilt toward Tehran has been watched with worry by Washington, which is at loggerheads with the Islamic republic over its nuclear programme. Israel sees the prospect of an Iranian bomb as a threat. Israelis were also upset by two Turkish television dramas showing their soldiers as murderers of Palestinian children and their diplomats as masterminds of a kidnapping ring. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Turkey was aligning itself with Muslim countries hostile to Israel like Iran since before the Gaza war. Erdogan brokered short-lived Israeli-Syrian peace talks in 2008. Some Israeli officials now question his fitness to mediate and Netanyahu had said his government would negotiate only directly with Damascus. Despite the diplomatic row, Turkey is trying to seal the purchase of 10 Heron drones in a deal worth $180 million, officials on both sides said. An Israeli official on Sunday said the deal looked close to being finalised. Turkey has no drones of its own. "I believe they're wrapping things up now. A compensation fee has been paid, and the delivery of the first four drones is expected by April," the official said. Turkey is also awaiting delivery of $141 million worth of warplane camera pods from Israel, a sale that was signed shortly before the Gaza war, an Israeli defence source s
