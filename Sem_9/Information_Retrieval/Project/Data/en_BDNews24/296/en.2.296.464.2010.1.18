 Dhaka, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com)--Prime minister Sheikh Hasina will be attending the funeral of the legendary Indian communist patriarch Jyoti Basu. A high-ranked official confirmed this decision to bdnews24.com on condition that he not be named. Earlier, prime minister's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad had said she may to Kolkata to join the funeral. The former chief minister of West Bengal died around 12:15pm Bangladesh time on Sunday, from multiple organ failure at a private hospital in Salt Lake, where he was treated for the past 15 days. The ancestral home of one of the greatest communist icons of the sub-continent is at Bardi village of Sonargaon in Narayanganj. He was critically ill during Hasina's Jan 10-13 India tour. She had voiced her concern over the deteriorating health of the ailing Marxist leader, who ruled India's eastern state of West Bengal as chief minister for 23 long years. The prime minister expressed her grievance at not being able to visit the leader: "We are very worried about the health of Jyoti Basu who is a highly respected in both India and Bangladesh." "I wanted to see him during my trip to India but could not make it," Hasina had told journalists in New Delhi at the end of her visit. "But I will see him when I come here next time," she had added. The prime minister was originally scheduled to go to West Bengal during her visit, not only to meet the ailing communist leader in Kolkata, but also to visit Vishwa Bharati at Shantiniketan. But she later returned home only after visiting Delhi and Ajmer due to change in plans. bdnew
