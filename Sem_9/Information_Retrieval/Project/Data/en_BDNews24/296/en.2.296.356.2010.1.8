 Shyadul Islam Talat bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com)--Mobile phone sets imported from China with identical IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) numbers are flooding the markets. Telecoms regulator BTRC is evasive over the police's request to ban the import of such sets that are getting popular with the extortionists and criminals. The law enforcers found large number of cellphone sets with similar IMEI number during recent anti-extortion drive, which make it difficult to trace out the criminals involved in extortion or making threats on mobile phone. Police detectives discovered about 6,500 mobile sets bearing the same IMEI number when they were investigating an extortion case. Each GSM or UMTS mobile set has a particular number containing 15-17 digits which merge with network after every use. The number is used for setting the lost mobile set off, tracing it out or making it ineffective. Surrey, England-based British Approval Board for Telecommunication (BABT) is monitoring the system internationally and Bangladesh is one of the members of BABT. Though each mobile set is supposed to have distinct number, numerous cheap sets made in China bear similar number. In India, Department of Telecom (DOT) has directed mobile operators to disconnect mobile sets having no IMEI or similar IMEI numbers. Assistant commissioner of metropolitan Detective Branch of police, Sanwar Hossain told bdnews24.com, "I discovered 12,500 sets with same IMEI number when I investigated a case." "It is getting increasingly difficult to trace out the criminals who make threat or create nuisance on mobile phone." Deputy commissioner of Detective Branch Monirul Islam said, "We have resolved many cases only through IMEI number, but now it seems almost impossible as sets without IMEI have flooded the market." "We are helpless as BTRC is not taking any decisive action against such illegal practice," he complained. Police officials alleged that the criminals were changing SIM after carrying out extortion or making threat. As per the statistics of police's cyber crime cell, 2447 SIMs were cancelled upon 1376 allegations in 2009. Of them, 1673 SIMs were blocked on allegation of extortion and 774 for making threats. Police officials also said sometimes criminals themselves dumped the SIM. It is possible to eliminate the syndicate if the criminals can be apprehended, they said and added that negligence of BTRC has led to the growing import of such mobile sets in to the country. BTRC commissioner Malik Sudhir Chandra told bdnews24.com, "We have taken some steps after getting such allegations and issued directives so that no-one can import or sell such mobile sets." bdnews
