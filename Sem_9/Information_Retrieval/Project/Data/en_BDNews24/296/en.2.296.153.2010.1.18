 Dhaka, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com)  An armed battle at Dhaka University campus on Monday between two rival groups of Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, over positions in JCD's newly formed committee, left at least 20 people injured, including the Shahbagh police chief and JCD president. DU proctor Prof Saiful Islam Khan was also hurt. He was taken to BSMMU Hospital while Karim and another injured police officer were taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. Central committee president Sultan Salauddin Tuku, who came under direct attack by rivals, was also rushed to DMCH, along with at least four other injured JCD leaders and activists. All university classes were suspended for the day. But exams were held, officials said. The fighting JCD groups exploded cocktails and exchanged several rounds of gunfire, police and witnesses said. Police chief Rezaul Karim told reporters at DMCH that his men had to throw several rounds of teargas shells to bring the situation under control. Leaders of the recently formed JCD committee were obstructed by a rival Chhatra Dal group from entering the campus in the morning, witnesses said. Both groups became locked in fierce clashes. A group of Bangladesh Chhatra League leaders also became involved in the violence at one point, witnesses said Police chief Karim said: "We had tightened security on the campus Monday morning on information that rival JCD groups had taken position on the campus Sunday night. "The two groups became involved in clashes from 10am. We tried to protect Chhatra Dal president Tuku. I was injured during that time." He said police would launch a special drive to recover the arms that were used during the clashes. DU assistant proctor Amzad Hossain told bdnews24.com at least 20 people were injured in the clashes.
