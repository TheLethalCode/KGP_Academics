 Dhaka, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Bank unveiled its half-yearly monetary policy on Tuesday, which aims to contain average inflation under 6.5 per cent eying the government's growth target, and bring more people under banking services. Central bank governor Atiur Rahman termed the policy, to cover the second half of FY 2010 from January to June, as "inclusive". "A major goal of the policy is to bring more people under financial services," Rahman said as he presented the policy at the bank's headquarters in the city. "We want to attain growth through financial inclusion." 'BROAD GROWTH, MODERATE INFLATION' Meanwhile, the bank, in its ninth half-yearly monetary policy statement (MPS), has targeted "broad-based economic growth  while containing inflation within moderate tolerable levels". It eyes 5.5-6.0 percent GDP growth for FY 2010, in line with this fiscal year's budget forecast, and average 12-month inflation not exceeding 6.5 percent. Average 12-month inflation fell from 6.6 percent at the start of the fiscal year to 5.11 percent as of October 2009. But point-point inflation during the same period soared from 2.25 percent in June 2009 to 6.71 percent in October. The governor admitted further inflationary risk before the fiscal year-end. "Average inflation has remained under 6 percent over the last six months. It will rise slightly but not exceed 6.5 percent," Rahman said. He suggested keeping farm output up, ensuring smooth supply chain and continuing interventionist measures such as open market sales of rice to contain inflation. The bank was optimistic on the farm production side. "The government and BB have maintained watch on timely availability of necessary inputs and financing for growers," it said in its statement. It cited 13.10 million tonnes Aman rice output in FY 2010 as substantially higher compared to 11.61 million tonnes in FY 2009. The success of Aman prodiction has encouraged farmers to expand acreage for the Boro rice crop, said the bank. "Overall, barring unforeseen adversities, it will not be unrealistic to expect agriculture sector output growth to match or come close to the strong FY 2009 performance," said the bank. The MPS said surplus liquidity seen at the beginning of FY 2010 was being used up in private sector credit and import growth driven by pick up in output and investment activities from the second quarter onwards. This had "allayed concerns that the liquidity surplus could largely end up stoking inflation", said the bank. It also observed that monetary conditions were "no longer as lax as at the beginning of FY 2010", with the weighted average inter-bank call money rate, which went below one percent in July 09, now standing above four percent. 'BROADLY UNCHANGED POLICY' The growth and inflation outlook in the latest monetary policy statement remained broadly unchanged from that of the first half of FY 2010, the central bank said in its statement. The governor said monetary policy for the previous half-year period had been successful. "The economy responded positively." The central bank in its statement saw domestic demand as "robust", well supported by growing remittance inflows and budgetary stimulus outlays. It cited a rising trend in opening of LCs for productive imports in response to domestic demand. Referring to the rise in credit flow to the private sector, despite gas and power crises, Rahman said it appeared that "investors have found places for investment". But the central bank also noted exports slowing "somewhat" with extra-cautious spending by consumers in developed countries in the west as a matter of some concern. In light of the unfolding global context, therefore, the bank said "supportive monetary stance and stimulatory fiscal stance" needs to continue till fuller restoration of investment confidence in the domestic economy. b
