 NEW DELHI, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co said on Friday the Indian Air Force is keen to acquire 10 C-17 Globemaster III aircraft and the US government has received a letter of request from New Delhi. "Boeing is very pleased that the Indian government has expressed interest in acquiring the C-17 to modernize its airlift capabilities, and we look forward to working closely with them," Vivek Lall, country head of Boeing's Integrated Defense Systems, said in a statement. The deal is potentially worth billions of dollars. The C-17 is a heavylift aircraft, capable of carrying large combat equipment and troops, Lall said. "With a payload of up to 170,000 pounds, the C-17 can take off and land in 3,000 feet or less," Lall said. The Indian government says it will prioritise defence and push forward pending projects to modernise its armed forces and its largely Soviet-era equipment, especially after the 2008 November Mumbai attacks revealed security loopholes. India is looking to spend more than $50 billion over the next five years to modernise its defence systems. Boeing, which is eyeing the Indian defence market, has already submitted two proposals to the Indian Air Force, offering the AH-64D Apache and the CH-47F Chinook in a deal potentially worth $2 bill
