<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com)--BNP chief Khaleda Zia has said that her party is not against multilateral connectivity in the region but against the government's 'only India-centric policy'. "We are not against region-based multilateral 'true' connectivity. We have always been talking about including all friendly nations like Nepal, Bhutan, China, Myanmar and Thailand in that connectivity." she said at a news conference on Sunday. The press conference at her Gulshan office was called to spell out the opposition's reaction to the outcome of the prime minister's January 10-13 India tour. The two-time former prime minister said, "That is why we approved a 'specific route map' of the Asian highway. But now initiative has been taken to change that and give corridor to India only." The leader of the opposition said, "We are only opposing the current government's policy of discarding national interest and making everything India-oriented, India-centred and for Indian interest." She also said the real reason behind bringing 250MW of power from India is to ensure permanent transit facility for India in the name of bringing in heavy instruments and equipment to build power stations. "The prime minister has done exactly that in this tour to India." During the visit, India agreed to supply 250MW of power from its national grid to the power-starved Bangladesh. bdn
