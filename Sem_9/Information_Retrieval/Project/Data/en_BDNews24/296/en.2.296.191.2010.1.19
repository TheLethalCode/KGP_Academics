 By Baby Moudud bdnews24.com social affairs editor Kolkata, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com)  Jyoti Basu's death has left a political vacuum in the region, prime minister Sheikh Hasina said as she paid her last respects to the former chief minister of West Bengal in Kolkata on Tuesday. The lion of Indian communism, who died on Sunday at the age of 95, was given state honours and a gun salute on his last journey before his body was handed over to a hospital in Kolkata for medical research. Hasina departed Dhaka in the morning on a BAF aircraft to attend the funeral. She went straight to the Bidhan Sabha, lower house of the state legislature, after landing in the West Bengal capital, to lay a wreath on Basu's coffin and sign the condolence book. In her message, Hasina wrote, "We deeply mourn the loss of Jyoti Basu, the veteran Indian politician and a true friend of Bangladesh. An active life has come to an end of one who worked for common people all through his life." "The death has left a vacuum in the political arena of the sub-continent." "His memory will remain forever in our hearts. We remember his contribution and compassion during the war of independence in 1971. We have lost a well wisher," wrote the PM of the iconic Marxist leader, whose ancestral home was in Sonargaon, near Dhaka. KOLKATA BIDS GOODBYE Kolkata was paying its last respects to Basu, who headed a CPI(M) state government in West Bengal for 23 long years from 1977.
