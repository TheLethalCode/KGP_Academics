<TITLE> Aid for Haiti reaching only the luckiest </TITLE>

 HAITI, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)-The handwritten, multilingual sign stands in the middle of a Port-au-Prince street, nailed to a post, with an arrow underneath pointing up to a yard packed with refugees. Signs like that are springing up in roads, and on walls, around the Haitian capital as survivors of one of the world's worst earthquakes wait for aid that is not arriving in the quantities needed -- or simply not at all. Assistance that is trickling through comes in such a chaotic, haphazard fashion that there seems to be little central planning or targeting of the most vulnerable. Western aid-workers handing out packets of biscuits in one street give up on any sort of orderly distribution, scrambling atop a wall to throw the food high in the air -- like sweets at a kids' party -- to be grabbed by the tallest and strongest. A fire-engine wheels into a slum and opens its tap, the first time many there have received drinking water since the earthquake. Within a minute, 50 people rush to the truck and hundreds more come surging forward as word spreads. Women push and shove to reach the tap, allowing precious water to slop on the floor instead of into their empty buckets. "This is the first time since the tragedy that I have seen any water," said Dedette Saint-Ville, beaming as she emerged triumphant with the first bucket-full of water. "Now where can we get food? We have nothing to eat." 'HAPPY NEW YEAR' Impatient at roads clogged with cars and rubble, plus other logistical problems, American military helicopters have taken to the skies, landing wherever there is space and wherever they see large groups of refugees. But while the bags and bottles of water are gratefully received, the Meals Ready to Eat (MREs) military rations are creating great confusion. Some Haitians are just tearing the MREs open, unaware they need to be mixed with water. "The distribution is not organized in any way," said Estime Pierre Deny, shaking his head as a crowd jostles for water from a truck belonging to a state company. "Look at this. Only the strong can fight for this water. The weak and the sick and the old and the tiny ones, the ones who most need it, do not have a chance. Quite a lot of time has elapsed now. Things should really be done better by now." Despite such scenes of people fighting over the aid that is getting through, there is also plenty of evidence of Haitians sharing among themselves, and trying to look after the most needy. Even among looters. Honore Levy says the boxes of soap he stole from a collapsed downtown supermarket would be sold to buy food and water for his five children. "What option do I have?" he says, taking away his goods before police arrive, firing shots and tear-gas to disperse the looters. Overhead reads a banner pre-dating the earthquake, remarkably still strung across the road from two poles that somehow survived the devastation. "The Port-au-Prince mayor's office wishes you a very Happy Christmas and New Year 20
