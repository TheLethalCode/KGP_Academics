<TITLE> Button celebrates birthday with another 30 in mind </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jenson Button celebrated his birthday on Tuesday with the number 30 playing on his mind ahead of a first meeting with Lewis Hamilton since the two British Formula One champions became McLaren team-mates. Reaching 30 years of age was one thing, but joining an elite 30 percent of back-to-back winners will be more his focus over the coming campaign. "There's an interesting fact that 70 percent of sportsmen, if they win the world championship don't achieve the next season," Button told reporters at an event for team title sponsor Vodafone. "So it's about working out why the 30 percent do and mentally being ready to go into the new season ... I'm working on that one." Hamilton, the 2008 champion whose crown Button took last year with Brawn GP (now Mercedes), is the rival who stands in his way and the two will meet up on Wednesday at Woking. "It's understandable that the team love Lewis, they should love Lewis," said Button, who has faced dire warnings that he is stepping into the Lions' Den and risks being slaughtered by Hamilton on the track. "Lewis is a world champion and he's been with them for three years and done exceptionally well. "When we start testing we need to be working together and we need to share everything and that's the key for us being ready at the first race," added the Briton, who last spoke to Hamilton face-to-face in November. "We'll be seeing each other tomorrow and spending time talking about the new car. I don't know if Lewis is driving the simulator but I am. We will have an in-depth chat. It should be fun, I'm looking forward to spending a bit of time with him." CHANGED MAN Hamilton will notice immediately that Button is a changed man, having shaved off his whiskers since their last meeting. "I thought I'd better have a trim because it's the first time I've had a younger team mate," joked the champion. "So I thought try and make yourself look a bit younger." Button said he was getting a "real buzz" out of being in a "homely environment" at McLaren. With testing off limits until next month, he has been spending time in McLaren's simulator while establishing a relationship with new engineers. "Communication is so important when you have arrived at a new team," he said. "You could be the best engineer in the world and the best driver but if you don't gel it's not going to work. "I spend a lot of time with Jak (Jakob Andreason) and Dave (Robson), the two engineers I will be working with -- a comedy stand-up team it sounds like -- and they've been great. "I think I've got a pretty good base already to build on with the team over the next few weeks." Button said his McLaren test debut in Valencia, more than a decade after the team gave him his first taste of a Formula One car as winner of a young driver award, would be one to savour. "The first time was back in '99 and this time I will be stepping in with the number one on it and it will be my number one and not Mika Hakkinen's," he said. "It will be a very special day in my life and my career but I will get over that pretty quickly and concentrate on what's import
