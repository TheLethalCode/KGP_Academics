 Dhaka, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com)-- Prime minister Sheikh Hasina expressed sorrow at the death of legendary Left leader Jyoti Basu on Sunday, whom she called "a true friend" of Bangladesh". She told parliament that the Ganges water treaty and Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord were signed mainly due to Basu. While delivering a speech on Basu's life and contribution to politics, Hasina said she would go to Kolkata to attend the funeral. She also said Basu's ancestral home in Sonargaon, Narayanganj, would be turned into a library according to his desire. Hasina was speaking in parliament as the Jatiya Sangsad Speaker Abdul Hamid moved a condolence motion. The House unanimously adopted the motion and the speaker withheld all other parliamentary business. The MPs also stood for one minute of silence. Basu, who passed away in Kolkata around midday, was critically ill during Hasina's January 10-13 India tour. She had voiced her concern over the deteriorating health of the ailing Communist patriarch who was chief minister of West Bengal for 23 years from 1977 at the head of CPI-M-headed Left Front government.. The charismatic Marxist leader, who was born in Sonargaon, died in a Kolkata hospital midday Sunday, after battling pneumonia and complications since the new year. He was 95. "I have to give you the sad news that Jyoti babu is no longer with us," Biman Bose, chairperson of the Left Front coordination committee, announced to Indian media a little after 12.30pm local time. His personal physician Dr Ajit Kumar Maity said Basu breathed his last at 11.47am (IST) at the AMRI Hospital, where he was admitted with pneumonia on January 1. He was put on a ventilator on January 6. The veteran leader was in critical condition from late Saturday night after suffering multiple organ failure. He is survived by his son Chandan. His wife Kamal died four years ago.
