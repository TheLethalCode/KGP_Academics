<TITLE> Khaleda starts press conference </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson and leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia was holding press conference on the prime minister's recent India tour at her Gulshan office on Sunday. Senior party leaders, including BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, other standing committee and advisory committee members, were present at the conference. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Saturday had strongly defended the outcome of her India tour, tackling some of the criticisms that have been aired by the opposition since her return, at a formal press briefing for the media and public, the first of its kind attended by scores of senior journalists and televised live from the Prime Minister's Office. Saturday's press conference, staged by the fountain at front of the Prime Minister's Office, saw a huge turnout by ruling party and alliance members in a show of support for the "success" of the India tour, which the opposition alliance has repeatedly called a "total failure". The prime minister on return from India had said her visit marked the start of a new era of cooperation between the two neighbours. Critics, mainly the opposition BNP, however, have said Bangladesh gained no more than vague assurances while India secured concrete gains. Hasina returned home on January 13 after a four-day visit to the neighboring country. Bangladesh and India on Jan 11 signed three agreements on combating crime and two MoUs on power cooperation and cultural exchange, among other bilateral arrangements, during Hasina's visit. bdn
