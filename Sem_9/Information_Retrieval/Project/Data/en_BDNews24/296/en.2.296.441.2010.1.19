 PARIS, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - France on Tuesday played down reports of a rift with the United States over its management of the airport in Haiti since last week's devastating earthquake, saying cooperation between the two countries was going well.

"They welcome the exceptional mobilisation of the United States towards Haiti and the essential role it is playing on the ground." Haitian officials have said the death toll from the magnitude 7.0 earthquake, which destroyed much of the capital on Jan 12, was likely to be between 100,000 and 200,000.
