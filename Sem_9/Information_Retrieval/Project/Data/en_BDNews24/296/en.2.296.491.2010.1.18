<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com)--The government is considering formation of 18 new municipalities, increasing them to 327 from the current 309. Replying to a question in parliament on Monday, local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam said the government was 'actively considering' 18 new municipalities. He also said that the government had taken an initiative to define responsibilities of chairmen and vice chairmen of the upazila councils. A proposal had been sent to the law ministry for vetting, he added, replying to a question from Jatiya Party MP Noor-e-Hasna Lily Chowdhury. Experts see the concrete outlining of local government representatives' duties and responsibilities as a crucial factor to make the sub-district level units effective and functional. Absence of a clear definition has resulted in a rift between the public representatives and the bureaucracy over the control of development activities at the sub-district level. The new municipalities are Kuakata in Patuakhali, Kamlakanda in Netrokona, Lohagara and Dohazari in Chittagong , Tarash in Sirajganj, Bonarpara, Saghata and Polashbari in Gaibandha, Kachua in Bagerhat, Fatulla in Narayanganj, Basail and Elenga in Tangail, Narayanpur in Chandpur, Uzirpur in Barisal, Hatibandha in Lalmonirhat, Kaliganj in Gazipur, Rajoir in Madaripur, and Monoharganj in Comilla
