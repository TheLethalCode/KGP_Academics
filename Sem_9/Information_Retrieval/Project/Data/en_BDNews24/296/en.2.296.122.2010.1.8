 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com)--In the national park on Nijhum Dwip, the tiny island in the Bay, there has been a scarcity of food for deer as their number has multiplied over the years. The number of Chitra deer, a gracefully colored spotted species, is now around 20,000 by different estimates, rising dramatically as there is no natural predator living on the island, officials say. The government is considering halving the number of deer on the island, with discussions going on as to how to do that. The wildlife advisory board at a meeting last year opined that the number of Chitra deer should be reduced to just 10,000-15,000. According to a government census in 2006, the number of deer on the island was 14,400, but the government has no updated figures since then. However, experts put their existing number between 20,000 and 25,000. After a tour of Nijhum Dwip, advisory board member and executive chairman of Wildlife Trust of Bangladesh (WTB) Anwarul Islam told bdnews24.com that staple food for Chitra deer is keora leaf but food problem of the deer is becoming acute as keora plants on the island have grown tall. Another advisory board member and professor of Dhaka University botany department Kazi Abdul Fattah said, "We are in favour of reducing the number of deer and the government is also considering the matter." "We had a meeting to discuss the matter a few months ago and the authorities will give a final decision after consulting the state minister for environment," he said. Nijhum Dwip lies to the south of Hatiya Upazila in the Bay of Bengal under Noakhali district. It was formerly known as Char Osman. A sanctuary for Chitra deer, the island also abounds with buffaloes. The government declared Nijhum Dwip as a national park in 2001. Prof Anwarul Islam of Dhaka University zoology department said, "Four pairs of deer were released on the island in 1978 and their number multiplied over the yearsthanks to the island's deep vegetation and favourable environment." Environment and forest officials said about 1.20 lakh deer live in an area of 14.90 lakh acres of the Sundarbansthe southwestern mangrove forest. A deer lives per 12.4 acres of land in the Sundarbans forest while one deer lives per 0.33 acres on the 5,000 acre land of Nijhum Dwip forest spanning 20 square kilometres. Nijhum Dwip is yet to be declared as an exclusive zone for wildlife for various reasons, mainly because the island was designated as a tourist spot. Chief ranger of forests Abdul Motalib told bdnews24.com, "Reducing the number of deer is under consideration, but it is yet to be decided how it should be done." A decision would be taken on the basis of opinion of wildlife advisory board, he said, adding that the board was divided over the way of reducing the number of deer. The advisory board was formed during the regime of last caretaker government. Prof Kazi Fattah opined that some of deer population could be relocated elsewhere on the basis of their age. But such relocation could be risky, Fattah said, adding, "Fawns can be shifted to elsewhere but deaths may occur during transportation." He said deer hunting is permitted on special occasions in other countries and it can also be permitted here, particularly at the time of Eid-ul-Azha. Meanwhile, local people on the island said an increasing number of deer became prey to wild dogs which were now feasting on them. Until now, 17 dogs were killed and efforts were being taken to limit cattle grazing on the island to ensure food for deer, said Prof Fattah. He opined that different species of trees, including Keora, should be planted in the forest on the island to save the existing deer population until a relocation process is undertaken. Opposing the move to make it a tourist spot, Prof Fattah said, "No land or part of the forest should be leased out for building tourist facilities and the island should be declared a protected zone." Chief ranger Abdul Motaleb on the other hand said, "There is no situation to declare the forest as a sanctuary." He said, "The common people will face problem if it is declared an exclusive zone. Besides, declaration of such zone is not possible in an open area." Officials in charge of forest and environment ministry told bdnews24.com that there was no alternative to reducing the number of deer in the face of growing food crisis, otherwise many of them would die of starvation. The government is emphasising on increasing feed supply rather than killing the deer, they said. bd
