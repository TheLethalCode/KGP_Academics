<TITLE> Healthcare reform in doubt after stunning Senate election defeat </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 By Arshad Mahmud Washington, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com) - On the eve of his first anniversary in office President Obama was dealt a big blow by the voters in Massachusetts, a traditionally strong Democratic state, after a little-known Republican state senator, won a Senate seat long held by Edward Kennedy, who died last year. The election of Scott Brown over Democratic candidate Martha Coakley in a special election underscored the deep anger and frustration against the way the Democrats are running things in Washington in just one year since the historic election of Barack Obama, the first African-American to win the presidency. The election result left Democrats in Congress stunned because of the serious implications it is most likely to have on the much-anticipated healthcare reform, which the late Kennedy had called "the cause of my life." Brown has vowed to oppose the bill, and once he takes office the Democrats will lose their filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. Beyond the reform, the election of a man supported by the Tea Party movement, which grew out of anger and frustration with both Republican and Democratic leaders, also represented an unexpected reproach by many voters of Obama's first year in office, and struck fear into the hearts of Democratic lawmakers, who are already worried about their prospects later this year in the midterm elections. The implications of the election drew nationwide attention, and millions of dollars of outside spending, to the race. It transformed what many had expected to be a sleepy, low-turnout special election on a snowy day in January into a high-profile contest that appeared to draw more voters than expected to the polls. What exactly caused the upset for democrats is being debated widely. But most analysts agree that Brown was able to appeal to independent voters who were anxious about the economy and concerned about the direction taken by Democrats, now that they control all the branches of government. He rallied his supporters when he said, at the last debate, that he was not running for Kennedy's seat but for "the people's seat." That seat, held for nearly half a century by Kennedy, the liberal lion of the Senate, will now be held by a Republican who has said he supports waterboarding as an interrogation technique for terrorism suspects; opposes a federal cap-and-trade program to reduce carbon emissions; and opposes a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants unless they leave the country. It was a sharp swing of the pendulum, but even Democratic voters said they wanted the Obama administration to change direction. "I'm hoping that it gives a message to the country," said Marlene Connolly, 73, a lifelong Democrat who said she cast her first vote for a Republican on Tuesday. "I think if Massachusetts puts Brown in, it's a message of 'that's enough.' Let's stop the giveaways and let's get jobs going", she told the New York Times. Brown presented himself as a Massachusetts Everyman, featuring the pickup truck he drives around the state in his speeches and one of his television ads, calling in to talk radio shows, and campaigning with popular local sports figures. As voters went to the polls, Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, made it clear that the president was "not pleased" with the situation Ms. Coakley found herself in. "He was both surprised and frustrated," Gibbs said. On Capitol Hill, the fate of the healthcare legislation was highly uncertain as Democratic leaders quickly gathered to plot strategy in the wake of the Republican victory. Sentiment about how to proceed was mixed, with several House lawmakers expressing wariness about accepting a Senate-passed plan due to their deep reservations about it. But top officials said that approach may be the party's best alternative and most House members said they still believed it was crucial that Democrats pass a plan. "It is important for us to pass legislation," said Representative Baron Hill, a conservative Democrat from Indiana. But Rep. Barney Frank, a leading Democrat in the House, said that he was in favor of reevaluating the healthcare bill following the Republican victory of Scott Brown and Democrats should not rush into any decision in view of the voters' judgment in Massachusetts.
