 Dhaka, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com)--BNP has called on nationalist forces to unite to 'safeguard independence of the country' in the wake of the government signing deals with India. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain made the call at a discussion to mark 74th birth anniversary of late president Ziaur Rahman on Tuesday. Delwar said, "The government has created crisis as it sacrificed the interest of the country by signing the deals. Today all nationalist forces will have to unite in protecting independence and sovereignty of the country." Delwar demanded proper and neutral probe into the incident that took place on Dhaka University campus on Monday. The clash occurred between two rival factions of Jaityatabadi Chhatra Dal, student wing of BNP, following grievances over the new central committee. JCD, however, accused Dhaka University administration and pro-ruling Awami League Bangladesh Chhatra League of having a hand in the clash. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia listened to the discussion sitting among the audience. The discussants highlighted the lifetime activities of president Ziaur Rahman and slammed the present government for its activities. In the morning, Khaleda along with her party leaders placed wreath at the grave of Zia. Pointing to the clash at Dhaka University, Delwar said, "Being segregated from the people, the government is swooping on the opposition parties." Delwar slammed the recent deals signed with India during prime minister Sheikh Hasina's four-day visit. Bangladesh and India on Jan 11 signed three agreements on combating crime and two MoUs on power cooperation and cultural exchange, among other bilateral arrangements. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, in a televised press conference on Sunday, claimed the prime minister "signed a secret security deal" with New Delhi. "Those who orchestrated 1/11 changeover installed Awami League as a puppet government through a fixed election." He criticised the recent statement by Awami League general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam that they will have to implement the deals as people gave them mandate to sign them. Reminiscing the life of Zia, Delwar said, "Enemies from home and abroad assassinated Zia as he wanted to build an independent and self-dependent Bangladesh." The discussion chaired by party's vice president TH Khan was addressed among others by standing committee members Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, Moudud Ahmed, ASM Hannan Shah, advisory council members Shawakat Mahmud and Dhaka University professor Mahmub Ullah. bdne
