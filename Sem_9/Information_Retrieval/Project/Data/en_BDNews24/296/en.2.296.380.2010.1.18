 Dhaka, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com)  Clemency petitions by three of the five army officers with death sentences pending for the 1975 killing of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman have been rejected by president Zillur Rahman and sent back to the home ministry, an official said on Monday. Mohammed Shafiul Alam, secretary to the president, told bdnews24.com: "There is nothing more to do here. The petition has been refused and was sent to the home ministry on Sunday." Inspector general of prisons Brig Gen Md Ashraful Islam Khan told a press briefing on Jan 9 that Bazlul Huda, Mohiuddin Ahmed and AKM Mohiuddin had submitted clemency petitions, while the two other convicted killers. Syed Faruque Rahman and Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan have not sought clemency yet. Law minister Shafique Ahmed earlier this month had opined: "Death convicts usually do not get clemency. The people involved with the heinous act of killing Bangabandhu and his family members cannot be forgiven." The minister also refuted allegations that the three convicted killers were forced to put their signatures to the clemency petitions. "There is no truth in such information. We did not press anybody for anything. A certain quarter is spreading rumours," he added. The comment came after family and legal counsel of Huda and AKM Mohiuddin said they knew nothing about the clemency pleas. Lawyer for the two, barrister Abdullah Al Mamun questioned the process of submission of the petitions. "It is mandatory that lawyers and relatives should be present while mercy petitions are submitted. But we do not know anything of them," he said on Jan 10. The Supreme Court, in a long-pending judgment, rejected appeals of the five convicted killers on Nov 19 last year, upholding the High Court's death penalties in the case. On Jan 3 this year, Dhaka district and sessions judge sent signed death warrants for all five to Dhaka Central Jail, where the convicted killers are being held in condemned cells. The condemned men officially had seven days from receiving the death warrants to seek clemency, according to law. Prison authorities began preparations for execution of the death penalties on issuance of the death warrants. Sentences must legally be executed between 21 and 28 days of the warrants being issued. bd
