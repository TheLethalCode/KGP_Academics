 Dhaka, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com)--Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad has sought to soothe his dissatisfied partymen over the gains from the one-year old the coalition government, saying they are not neglected in the Awami League-led Grand Alliance. Leaders of Jatiya Party--one of the main allies of the alliance that formed government last year after sweeping the elections recently--expressed grievance over past one year as they were not offered any major post in the government. It has a cabinet minister but the party had been clamouring in the lead-up to the polls for Ershad, a former military strongman, being handed the presidency. Ershad himself at a rally on Jan 6, marking one year of the government, had said that there had been a big gap between their expectations and achievements. "Jatiya Party is a big part of the Grand Alliance, it is not a neglected party," Ershad told a joint meeting of the party on Sunday. "The government will exist, the Grand Alliance will exist if Jatiya Party remains with them." Some Left-leaning parties are also in the alliance He asked the leaders to work hard to make the party stronger. "Nobody joins hands with the unfortunate. People make friends with strong people." The party chief said: "We cannot go beyond the alliance, but that does not mean that we will not have the capacity to go to elections alone." Ershad asked the party to gain the strength to run elections on its own. Ershad said the grassroots leaders are also being evaluated. "If anybody works sincerely they will be evaluated," he said. b
