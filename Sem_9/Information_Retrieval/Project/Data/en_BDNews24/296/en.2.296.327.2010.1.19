Taking cognizance of Chowdhury's case, metropolitan magistrate Roksana Begum Happy summoned Amar Desh acting editor Mahmudur Rahman, publisher Hasmat Ali and special correspondent M Abdullah to appear before the court on February 9.

With Chowdhury's lawsuit on Tuesday, the number of cases filed against Amar Desh in connection with the report, has now risen to 25.
