 Dhaka, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com)--Dhaka University vice-chancellor professor A A M S Arefin Siddique has said the reasons behind demanding his resignation by Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal are false and deceptive. The pro-BNP student wing on Monday blamed the Dhaka University administration and Bangladesh Chhatra League for the factional clashes that left at least 20 including JCD president Sultan Salauddin Tuku injured. They fought an armed battle over positions in the student organisation's newly formed committee. Proctor professor Saiful Islam Khan and Shahbagh police chief were also hurt. Prof Siddique said Shahiduddin Chowdhury Aenee, formerly JCD president and now BNP's student affairs secretary, called the vice-chancellor on Sunday night and sought an appointment to meet him the next day. But the vice-chancellor said he did not have any schedule for that day and asked them to tackle internal feuds themselves. He asked them not to do anything that would destabilise the campus. "Aenne called again at 9:30am on Monday. I told him what I said before." Even after that, he added, both the factions clashed. "It now seems that the clash was preplanned and made to happen to destabilise the campus," Siddique told a press conference on Tuesday. "The position of vice-chancellor is dignified. It is important not to do dirty politics with the position no matter who sits in that chair. "I did not allow the university to close even for a day in the last one year. I ask why Chhatra Dal called the strike on the campus for their internal feuds." Among others, exam controller Bahalul Haque Chowdhury and Dhaka University Teachers' Association president Bazlul Haque were present. bd
