 Dhaka, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com)The local government minister has alleged the previous BNP-led coalition government had arranged a meeting between former Pakistan military ruler General Pervez Musharraf and India's separatist ULFA leader Anup Chetia in Dhaka. Syed Ashraful Islam, also Awami League general secretary, made the claim on Friday at a roundtable on prime minister Sheikh Hasina's forthcoming India visit and Bangladesh-India bilateral relation. "Pervez Musharraf had a one and a half hours meeting with detained UFLA leader Anup Chetia at his hotel room during a visit when BNP and [Jamaat-e-Islami] were in power," he told the roundtable held at the National Press Club. "You can guess what had been discussed in such long meeting." The Pakistan strongman had visited Bangladesh in July 2002. Secretary general of the secessionist organisation, Chetia is currently detained in a Bangladesh jail since his arrest in 1998. The ULFA has been pursuing an armed struggle since 1979 with the professed objective of liberating the hydrocarbon-rich northeastern Indian state of Assam from what they term as New Delhi's 'colonial rule'. Thousands have died during its insurgent campaign. Indian media reported that Bangladesh government last month picked and deported the outfit's chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa to the Border Security Force. Raju Barua, the deputy commander-in-chief of ULFA's armed wing, was also arrested along with Rajkhowa, his wife and children. Dhaka has denied the arrest in Bangladesh of Rajkhowa. The AL leader termed Hasina's forthcoming visit to India as important, saying it will be a political trip and that she will not have any set agenda. "The visit will be a complete success. This will see revival of Bangladesh-India relations that are built on trust and confidence," he hoped. He said the 10-truckload of weapons in Chittagong and 30 million bullets in Bogra seized in Bangladesh were actually meant for use by Indian separatists. Blaming BNP and its allies for worsening of relations with India, Ashraf said media had reported that at that time the Taliban militants trained in Afghanistan entered India through Chittagong port using Bangladesh' territory. Islamist outfits in Bangladesh are posing a threat to India's national security, he said and added, "How can one expect good relation with India after all these had happened?" bd
