They were filed with the Appellate Division on Tuesday, the deadline for submission of review petitions, their counsel Khan Saifur Rahman told reporters. Three of the other five convicts who had their appeals overturned, Bazlul Huda, AKM Mohiuddin and Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, had filed review petitions earlier. Chief state counsel Anisul Haque earlier told reporters that hearing on all the review petitions would be held on Jan 24.

On Jan 3 this year, Dhaka district and sessions judge signed and sent death warrants for all five to Dhaka Central Jail, where the convicted killers are being held in condemned cells. Prison authorities began preparations for execution of the death penalties on issuance of the death warrants. Sentences must legally be executed between 21 and 28 days of the warrants being issued. b
