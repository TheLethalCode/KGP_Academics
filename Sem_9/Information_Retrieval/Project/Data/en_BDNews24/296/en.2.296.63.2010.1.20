<TITLE> Obama completes year with slump in approval </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 By Arshad Mahmud Washington, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com)President Obama completes his first year in office on Wednesday with one of the lowest approval ratings in US history. According to a CBS News poll, just 50 percent of the Americans say they approve of what Obama has done in his first year. Among all his predecessors since President Eisenhower in the 1950s, Obama is just 1 percent higher than Ronald Reagan, who had 49 percent approval rating; his immediate predecessor George W. Bush had enjoyed the support of 84 percent Americans in his first year. At 50 percent, Obama's approval rating is even lower than Jimmy Carter (51 percent) and Bill Clinton (54 percent). All were plagued by economic troubles  and Clinton also attempted to reform health care. Obama's latest rating is of course, good news for the Democrats as it has increased by 4 percent in the past one week. That rise is mainly attributed to his handling of the U.S. response to the earthquake in Haiti, which has received widespread approval from the American people. But when it comes to overall approval, the president has maintained his early high approval ratings only among Democrats (four in five approve). Only four in 10 independents and a quarter of Republicans now approve. A year ago, 56 percent of independents approved of the job President Obama was doing, as did 36 percent of Republicans. The CBS poll, conducted Jan. 14  Jan. 17, found that most Americans were disillusioned by Obama because they think his administration has so far done too much for big banks and not enough for small businesses or the middle class. They also think Obama has had limited success in meeting his campaign themes of bringing change to Washington and getting past partisanship. The poll suggests that Americans believe Obama has focused too much on helping American industry and not enough on helping Americans themselves. Forty-nine percent say the president has done too much for the banks, and 37 percent think he's done too much for U.S. auto makers. At the same time, 54 percent say he's done too little for the middle class, six in 10 think he's done too little for small businesses and a plurality says he's done too little for homeowners. As it has been throughout the Obama administration  and for part of the previous one -- the economy is the nation's top issue, and here the news is good for the president. Thirty-nine percent say Obama's policies have helped the economy, while 25 percent say they have hurt. Three in 10 say those policies have had no impact. But Americans are split on the issue that has taken up much of the first year's agenda -- the potential impact of health care reform. Forty-one percent say the health system would improve if reform passes, while 35 percent say it would get worse. Democrats are more optimistic, with 63 percent saying it would get better and only 11 percent saying it would get worse. On terrorism, however, 41 percent of Americans think the Obama administration's policies have had no impact on the U.S.' safety level. Twenty-eight percent say the country is safer while 22 percent say it is less safe. From a policy standpoint, partisan perceptions dominate these first-year evaluations. There are clear partisan divides on the economy, health care and terrorism, with Republicans highly critical of the president and Democrats supportive. One goal of the Obama campaign was to improve America's image abroad. More say he's done so (50 percent) than hasn't (20 percent)  yet the percent who think he's improved that image is down from July, when 60 percent thought so. More than half of Americans think Obama has accomplished about what they expected him to in his first year in office, but some voice disappointment. Twenty-six percent think the president has accomplished less than they expected, while only 14 percent say he has exceeded their expectations. There is disappointment about the president's fulfillment of the goals he laid out during his campaign. Less than one in five says he has kept all or most of his campaign promises. Three quarters say he has kept just some or hardly any of them. At the start of his presidency, two in three Americans expected Obama to be a good or very good president. A year later, just 46 percent say he has been good or very good, while 54 percent say he has been average or poor. Despite these evaluations, 62 percent of Americans remain optimistic about the next three years with Barack Obama as president  but that's down from 79 percent a year ago.
