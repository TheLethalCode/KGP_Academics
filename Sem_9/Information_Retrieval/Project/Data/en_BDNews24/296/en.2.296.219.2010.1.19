<TEXT>
 LONDON/CHICAGO, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kraft Foods agreed a deal to buy Cadbury for around 11.9 billion pounds ($19.6 billion), creating the world's top confectioner after frantic last-minute talks broke an impasse over price. Kraft's CEO Irene Rosenfeld had to inject more cash into her bid and cut the number of new Kraft shares in the offer to win over Roger Carr, chairman of the 186-year-old Cadbury, and mollify her top shareholder, billionaire investor Warren Buffett. Kraft's cash-and-share acquisition, which dealmakers said was struck after all-night negotiations at the London headquarters of investment bank Lazard, values each Cadbury share at 840 pence, with shareholders also set to get a 10p special dividend, bringing it to a total of 850p. Sources said Rosenfeld had prompted the talks by telephoning Carr on Sunday and suggesting a price of 830p, and although Carr insisted on 85Op they met on Monday morning at the Lanesborough Hotel, Hyde Park, in central London, where she offered 840p. Carr was firm and had his board's backing to insist on "850p or nothing" so their advisors set about hammering out a deal for 840p plus the 10p special dividend, ending a fourth-month standoff on the day a deadline for Kraft to raise its offer was due to expire. The enlarged group will pip privately owned Mars-Wrigley to the title of the world's top sweet maker, bringing under one roof Cadbury's Dairy Milk chocolate and Trident gum and Kraft's Milka, Toblerone and Terry's chocolate brands. Cadbury is attractive to Kraft because of its strong growth in emerging markets such as India and Latin America, whereas Kraft, famed for its Oreo biscuits and Philadelphia cheese, has well over half its sales in the mature North American market. Cadbury shares hit a record high of 838 pence in early trade and were up 3.3 percent 834p by 1320 GMT. "We believe this is a very well-priced, and well-structured, deal from a Kraft perspective and we expect Kraft's shares to open higher this afternoon which could push the value of the offer above 860p," said Panmure Gordon analyst Graham Jones. Kraft shares traded in Frankfurt were down 0.7 percent. The new bid, which won unanimous recommendation from the Cadbury board, consists of 500p of cash and 0.1874 new Kraft shares, compared to Kraft's original offer of 300p cash and 0.2589 new Kraft shares, which valued the shares at 745p in September, when the deal was first proposed Buffett, who owns a 9.4-percent stake in Kraft, had warned Rosenfeld not to overpay and issue too many new Kraft shares, and Kraft responded on Tuesday by saying it was issuing 265 million new shares compared with its original plan to issue 370 million. "At the end of the day, we would pay what we thought this outfit was worth," Rosenfeld said in an interview with Reuters. "I believe paying 13 times EBITDA for an asset of this quality is a very good price," she added. Despite paying a higher price, Rosenfeld said she expected the company's investment grade credit rating to be confirmed later on Tuesday. Cadbury shareholders now have until Feb. 2 to decide whether to accept a deal that values the shares at 13 times the group's estimated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) in 2009. Rosenfeld increased Kraft's annual cost savings target to at least $675 million by year three, up from $625 million, but made no mention of possible job losses at Cadbury 46,000 global workforce. She said that she found additional synergies after speaking to Cadbury's Carr.

"We are supportive of the management's decision although the achieved price is slightly light of our stated target," said David Cumming, head of UK equities at Standard Life. COUNTERBID NOT SEEN Analysts say a counter bid for Cadbury is unlikely. The UK Takeover Panel gave Hershey, the U.S.-based maker of Hershey's Kisses and Reese's peanut butter cups, and Italy's Nutella chocolate spread and Tic-Tac candy maker Ferrero until Jan. 25 to make a firm bid. Hershey declined comment on the Kraft-Cadbury deal. "Looking at precedent transaction multiples around 15 times, if Kraft can get one of the best consumer staples for 13 times, then good luck to them. It gives Kraft the growth engine they've been craving for years," said analyst Warren Ackerman at brokers Evolution Securities. Kraft said the deal would be accretive to 2011 earnings by around 5 cents on a cash basis and give a mid-teens percentage return on investment, well in excess of Kraft's cost of capital. Cadbury unions have opposed the move fearing big job cuts and UK politicians have also weighed in, with general elections looming, and UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown told a news conference after the deal was announced that he wanted to protect investment and jobs at Cadbury. "The one thing I want to say is this: we are determined that the levels of investment that take place in Cadbury's in the United Kingdom are maintained," he said. Felicity Loudon, a fourth generation member of Cadbury's founding family was appalled that the iconic chocolate maker looked destined to fall to Kraft, and believes that jobs will be lost and that Cadbury chocolate will never taste the same. "I'm horrified, we shouldn't give up. I just think there's a cultural imbalance. For a quintessentially, philanthropic iconic brand to sell out to a plastic cheese company - there's no mix there," she told Reuters. Kraft was advised by Lazard, Citi, Deutsche Bank and Centerview Partners, and Cadbury by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and
