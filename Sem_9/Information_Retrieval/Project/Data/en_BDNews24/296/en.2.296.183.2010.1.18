 Dhaka, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com)  Monday is the last day for voters to apply for changes, corrections or fresh enlistment in the latest draft voter roll prepared for the upcoming Dhaka City Corporation election. "One can apply for change or correction of one's information in the voter roll or for getting enlisted as a voter up to 5pm today," Biswas Lutfar Rahman, deputy election commissioner of Dhaka division, told bdnews24.com on Monday. The Dhaka district election office on January 3 published the draft voter list giving a 15-day time to apply for any change or correction in the roll. In the latest roll, around 37 lakh (3.7 million) people have been enlisted as voters, 2.35 lakh more than those in the previous list. The EC earlier said it would start the process of declaring the schedule for DCC polls after the final list is made public on February 3. The applications for change or correction or for fresh enrolment would be resolved by January 26 and included in the final list by January 31. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda earlier said the DCC elections, delayed by two-and-a-half years, would be held by March. The term of the current DCC elected officials, including the Mayor, expired on May 24, 2007. Election officials said the persons failing to get enrolled on Monday will get chance to be enlisted as voters by contacting Dhaka district election office. bd
