 Dhaka, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com)BNP's student wing Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal has called a two-day strike at Dhaka University and for the resignation of the vice-chancellor over Monday's incident where the organisation's president was injured. General secretary of JCD Amirul Islam Khan Alim at a press conference organised at the party's central office on Monday blamed the university administration and rival Bangladesh Chhatra League for the violence. An armed battle between two rival groups of JCD, over positions in the student organisation's newly formed committee, left at least 20 people injured, including the Shahbagh police chief and JCD president Sultan Salauddin Tuku. DU proctor Prof Saiful Islam Khan was also hurt. He was taken to BSMMU Hospital while Karim and another injured police officer were taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. Central committee president Tuku, who came under direct attack by rivals, was also rushed to DMCH, along with at least four other injured JCD leaders and activists. Alim alleged that the attack on JCD was a pre-planned incident and said, "Continuous movements would be staged at Dhaka University if those involved are not arrested and co-existence is ensured immediately." He also said that they will strike down the university on Tuesday and Thursday protesting the incident. Demonstration meetings would be held all over the country on Tuesday. bdnew
