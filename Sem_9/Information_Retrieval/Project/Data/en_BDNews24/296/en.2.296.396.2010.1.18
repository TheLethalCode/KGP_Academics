 LUBANGO, Angola, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cameroon, finalists in 2008, came back from the brink of elimination to scrape past Zambia 3-2 and revive their African Nations Cup campaign on Sunday. World Cup-bound Cameroon, who fell behind after a Rigobert Song blunder, moved to second in Group D on three points from two matches, one behind Gabon, who were earlier held 0-0 by Tunisia.
