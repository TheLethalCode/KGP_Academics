 Chittagong, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com)--Bangladesh and Myanmar launched into the second and final day of a sea-border conference on Saturday. The two 13-member delegations picked up from talks on Friday at the Agrabad Hotel in Chittagong. Md Khurshid Alam, additional foreign secretary heading the Bangladesh delegation, told reporters after the first day's meeting that Bangladesh was emphasising demarcation on basis of equity while Myanmar was pressing for the principle of equal distance. Myanmar deputy foreign minister U Maung Myint is heading the Myanmar side in the two-nation talks. This is the first such meeting since Bangladesh turned to the United Nations arbitration court in October last year for resolving long-standing disputes over maritime demarcation in the Bay of Bengal with Myanmar and India. At the same time, Bangladesh made it known that options for bilateral discussions and settlement would remain open. Bangladesh, India and Myanmar have been unable to exploit oil and gas reserves in the Bay due to claims and counter-claims for the offshore blocks. Out of Bangladesh's total 27 blocks, Myanmar and India have made overlapping claims on at least 18 in the complicated maritime geography. Foreign minister Dipu Moni has termed Indian and Myanmar claims as "aggressive" for blocking Bangladesh's sea zone. Dipu Moni has said the disputes could be resolved through UN arbitration in a maximum of four years if Bangladesh could not bury the disputes through bilateral talks. Bangladesh and Myanmar resumed talks on maritime boundary demarcation in 2008 after a break of 22 years. The two countries have had at least three rounds of talks on the issue since then but they yielded no tangible result. They have been unable to agree so far on determining the starting point or process for the boundary demarcation. bdnews24
