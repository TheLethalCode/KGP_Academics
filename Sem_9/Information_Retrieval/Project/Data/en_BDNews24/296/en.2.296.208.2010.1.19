 Sekander Ali Staff Correspondent, bdnews24.com Chittagong, Jan 19, (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh all-rounder Mahmudullah who celebrated his maiden Test half-century on the third day of the first Test against India on Tuesday, was not ruling out the hosts' chances of making a turnaround. "If we can properly utilise the fourth morning and pick up a few wickets then we will able to restrict them to a chasable target," he said.

I told Mushfiqur (Rahim) just be positive. Everything now depends on what happens on Wednesday." On the other hand, paceman Zaheer Khan was hoping that his team-mates would pile up some handsome runs over two sessions on the fourth day. "Already we have runs in the bank. So, weather-permitting we will be going for quick runs on Wednesday before making a declaration. And even if the match rolls into a fifth day, and there are no interruptions, a result is possible." Zaheer disagreed that Bangladesh's batsmen collapsed rather they were dismissed after good bowling. "It was a good bowling effort I thought. We knew it was important that we bowled in the right areas and be patient. Definitely the wicket improved as play went on," he sai
