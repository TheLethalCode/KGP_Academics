<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com)  Jamaat-e-Islami chief Motiur Rahman Nizami said Tuesday that the prime minister's claim of a successful India tour was "self-deception". He said the three deals signed during the visit proved that India is diplomatically successful, while Bangladesh gained nothing from the tour, Nizami said echoing the main opposition BNP. "The prime minister either tried to please New Delhi or it was a diplomatic failure," the Jamaat leader told a press conference on the PM's India trip at the party headquarters in Moghbazar. On her return from India prime minister Sheikh Hasina said her visit was a complete success. Jamaat's bigger political partner, and the main opposition in parliament, BNP called it a total failure. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia in a press briefing on Sunday said that the prime minister had totally sold out to India. Khaleda also alleged that Hasina had signed a "secret deal" on security matters with India. Nizami said, "People are worried about that (secret deal)." Referring to the Ganges water sharing deal and Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord, which were both signed during Sheikh Hasina's previous term as prime minister, Nizami said, "Most people think that they are against the country's interests and the constitution." In the run up to CHT peace accord, signed in 1997, Jamaat and its allies had claimed repeatedly that the hill tracts would eventually go to India. bdnew
