 Dhaka, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com)--Bharti Airtel, which has just bought a 70 percent stake of Warid Telecom, says its rollout strategy in Bangladesh will focus on the expectations of Bangladeshi customers. "For the next few months while in the process of understanding the market, we would explore what the customer expectations are as well as what expectations have been not met," Sanjay Kapoor, the deputy CEO, told reporters in Dhaka on Sunday. The Indian telecom company will also focus on building a good network infrastructure, Kapoor said. Bharti, one of the oldest players in the Indian telecom business, is also keen to launch its telecoms brand, Airtel, in Bangladesh, but says it will have to wait. "We will introduce the brand, but the timing is not appropriate now...it will come when the fundamentals are right," the Bharti deputy CEO said. On its prime target customers, Kapoor said likewise in India, Bangladesh also has a huge youth and rural population. "The youth and the rural population is the thing we would look on while proliferating this market." He also revealed plans for the wireless internet services, saying Bharti Airtel would launch 3-G technology in Bangladesh. "Once the regulator clears all the issues about 3-G, we will go for it." Replying to queries, the official said the company wanted to be one of the best service providers in the country. "We are definitely not happy being number four," said Kapoor, who had been appointed new CEO of Bharti Airtel just a day after it announced the Warid deal. The current CEO, Manoj Kohli, has been named the head of International Business Group of Bharti Airtel, and is due to take over in April. Meanwhile, Chris Tobit, a Delhi-based Anglo-Indian with strong Indian roots, will be the new CEO of Warid, replacing the Pakistani Muneer Farooqui. Tobit told bdnews24.com later in the evening that he would take over on Monday and was looking forward to his stint in Bangladesh. Kohli, who was also present at the news conference, said the company was looking forward to expanding in other emerging markets in the Middle East, Asia and Africa. "With one of the largest populations and only 32 percent penetration, Bangladesh is a huge emerging market," he said. He said Airtel brings affordability, quality service and innovative products to their customers. "These are our core factors for customer success." In its parent market, Airtel targets a 200 million plus subscriber-base as one of its future plans, Kohli said. Bharti Airtel on Tuesday said under the deal that could see the Indian company invest a total of $1 billion, it will make a fresh investment of US $300 million to rapidly expand the operations of Warid Telecom and will have management and board control of the company. The Dubai-based Dhabi Group will continue as a strategic partner retaining 30 percent shareholding and have their nominees on the board of Warid. Warid's current CEO Farooqui, Tobit and Airtel director of legal and regulatory affairs Narender Gupta were also present at the briefing held at the city's Westin Hotel where they later hosted a dinner attended by the telecoms minister, BTRC chairman, senior civil servants and senior editors.
