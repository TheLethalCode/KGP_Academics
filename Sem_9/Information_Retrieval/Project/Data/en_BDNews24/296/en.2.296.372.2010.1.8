 Dhaka, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com)  Local government minister and Awami League general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam on Friday gave students a severe telling-off over the recent spate of campus terrorism. His warning came a day after a Bangladesh Chhatra Maitree leader was killed in an attack by pro-Awami League Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL) activists at Rajshahi Polytechnic Institute. Speaking at a media briefing at AL president's political office in Dhanmondi, Ashraf asked students to stop criminal activities on campuses. "Or else, firm actions will be taken." The press briefing was arranged to highlight the Awami League-led grand alliance government's successes and failures in its first year of five-year term. "We have mostly stopped violence on campuses in the first year of our tenure." He also said that those who are involved in the Rajshahi Polytechnic Institute murder incident would get maximum punishment. On Thursday, Rezanur Chowdhury Sunny, vice-president of the pro-Workers Party student body, died in clashes and around 10 were injured. He accused university teachers for being involved in communal politics and said, "What will the students learn from these radical teachers?" Clashes between two BCL factions at Dhaka College, also on Thursday, left five injured. On Wednesday, armed clashes between BCL groups took place at Jahangirnagar University and the next day, the university authorities expelled four BCL activists on charges of their involvement in those clashes. Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina last year gave up the role of organisational chief of BCL in the wake of a spate of on-campus violence by the student organisation after the AL-led Grand Alliance coalition came to power. bdn
