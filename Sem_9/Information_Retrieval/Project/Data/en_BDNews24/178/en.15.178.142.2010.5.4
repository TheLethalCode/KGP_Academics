 CHICAGO, May 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nine members of a Christian militia group accused of plotting to kill police and wage war on the US government were ordered freed on bond on Monday by a judge who said prosecutors failed to show they posed a real threat. In a blistering attack, US District Court Judge Victoria Roberts in Detroit said prosecutors had failed to persuade her the defendants were a danger to the community.

The group's website says the term Hutaree means "Christian warrior" and says the group was "preparing for the end time battles to keep the testimony of Jesus Christ alive."
