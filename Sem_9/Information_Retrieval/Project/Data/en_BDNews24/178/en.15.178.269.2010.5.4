 Kushtia, May 4 (bdnews24.com)  An "extremist" is alleged to have been killed in a gunfight with police in Kushtia's Mirpur upazila early on Tuesday. Thirty five-year old Alim Biswas was the regional leader of outlawed extremist party Gano Bahini, said Kushtia's assistant superintendent of police Syed Mostafa Kamal. The detective branch of Kushtia police went to the upazila's Kalabaria village at around 2am after they were tipped off that a group of extremists were holding a clandestine meeting there, he said. Sensing their presence the criminals opened fires at the police forcing the law enforcers to fire back, he continued. At one stage the criminals are said to have fled the scene, when the police found Alim's body on the spot. One light gun, five bullet casings and five rounds of bullet were also recovered, Kamal said. Alim had eight cases including two murder and two extortion charges with Mirpur Police Station, the senior police official added. bd
