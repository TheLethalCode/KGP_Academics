<TITLE> Australia PM falls behind opposition in shock survey </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CANBERRA, May 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has fallen behind opponents for the first time in a key opinion survey after a range of controversial policy decisions as he readies for elections later this year. Rudd remains on course to win a second term in most other surveys, but the latest poll will come as jolt: the last time the conservative coalition shaded Labor in the closely watched Newspoll was in August 2006, before Rudd won power in late 2007. The new survey showed support for the Labor government down 5 points to 49 percent, while support for the conservatives soared 5 points to 51 percent after Rudd dropped several centrepiece policies that helped him win power in 2007. In a stormy political fortnight, Rudd dumped a promised emissions-trading scheme frozen in parliament, as well as a plan to improve national childcare. The government also hiked tobacco taxes and abandoned a controversial free home insulation scheme. "It is very clear that Labor has taken quite a caning and the (conservative) coalition hasn't gained everything it can from that. I think that probably is the story of this poll," Newspoll chief executive Martin O'Shannessy said. "It's possible that we have a rogue poll, although, funnily enough, while there's a chance of one in 20 that we get one over a certain percentage, the chance that we get one of such magnitude declines as well," he said. The poll slump comes two days after the government imposed a 40 percent tax on miners as part of a national tax review, but the survey was too early to reflect the tax reforms, which angered resource firms but may be popular with the public. Rudd, speaking at a business function in Sydney, said the poll reflected tough decisions taken by government, but it was too early to see any trend. "My job as prime minister is to act in the national interest, and if that means taking decisions which may be popular or unpopular, that's part of the job," Rudd said. The laters Reuters Poll Trend, which evens out poll results including Newspoll, shows government support climbing from two-year lows and with Labor holding a 10.4-point lead. PERSONAL POPULARITY However, while Rudd's standing as preferred prime minister fell 6 points to a record low of 50 percent, conservative coalition leader Tony Abbott's standing was only at 32 percent, albeit up three points. "It's still a political Everest that the coalition has got to climb," Abbott said. Economic management will be the key election battleground and Rudd's ability to steer Australia through the global crisis and avoid recession has given his administration kudos among many voters, despite oppositive criticism of excessive borrowings. Financial markets have so far shown little reaction to opinion polls ahead of elections, likely to be held in October, given they do not see a high risk of major economic policy switches. Both major parties are broadly centrist. But homeowners, particularly in crucial marginal mortgage belt electorates around Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, are concerned about rising interest rates in a nation where 68 percent of people own or are buying the home they live in. The Reserve Bank of Australia is due to release its latest interest rate decision at 2.30 p.m. (0430 GMT) on Tuesday, with a likely rise in benchmark lending rates to 4.50 percent, which would be the third in as many months as the economy steams ahead. In the poll, Labor's primary vote, at 35 percent, was its lowest since March 2006 when the government was in opposition. Primary support for the conservatives rose from 40 to 43 percent, while Greens' support was unchanged on 10 percent. The category of "others", or small parties and independents, rose from just 7 percent two weeks ago to 12 percent, meaning that while voters could be in a mood to punish the government, they are not yet ready to switch to the conservatives. "That's a pretty classic sign of a protest vote," Newspoll's O'Shannessy s
