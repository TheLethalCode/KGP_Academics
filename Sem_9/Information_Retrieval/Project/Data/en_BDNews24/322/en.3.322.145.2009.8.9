<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com)An expert committee tasked with oversight of school textbook printing and distribution for the 2010 academic year has advised the government to increase surveillance to identify causes of problems in the work. "Those creating a crisis over the production of textbooks are just as guilty as people who mix poison with baby food," Prof Md Akhtaruzzaman, head of the recently formed 16-member committee, told reporters at the National Curriculum and Textbook Board office on Saturday. Akhtaruzzaman, a lecturer in Islamic history and culture at Dhaka University, said difficulties in the production of school textbooks could be "politically motivated". "If anybody creates an artificial crisis in this fundamental issue of national importance, then that is surely tantamount to deceiving the nation," said Prof Akhtaruzzaman. He said arrangements were underway to print 210 million textbooks for classes one to nine. Arrangements had been made to dispatch textbooks to concerned district education officials for secondary, Ibtedai (madrasa primary-level), Dhakil (madrasa secondary-level) and technical classes by October 30. General education primary-level school books will be distributed by November 20 and all remaining textbooks by November 30, he said. Prof Akhtaruzzaman said production of the textbooks would require over 32,000 tonnes of paper, of which over 15,000 tonnes had already been procured. "The remaining paper will arrive on time," he said. Prof Syed Manzarul Islam, from Dhaka University's English department, said printing school textbooks could be done abroad if problems persisted. Also attending the meeting were Noman-Ur-Rashid, managing director of the Higher Education Directorate, NCTB chairman Mostafa Kamal and managing director of the Technical Education Directorate Nitai Chandra Sutradar.
