The surprise result was perhaps more due to the fact that Shakib Al Hasan's men reached Bulawayo on Thursday after a gruelling 40-hour journey via London, Dubai, Johannesburg and Harare. The second-string home side, chasing 181, reached the target in 38.1 overs for the loss of three wickets with Forster Mutizwa top scoring with 78 not out while former Zimbabwe skipper Tatenda Taibu remained unbeaten on 66. Pacers Nazmul Hossain and Syed Rasel shared the wickets to fall. Earlier, the Tigers, who won the toss, rode on Raqibul Hossain's half-century as they managed a modest total of 180 before being bowled out in 49.3. Raqibul hit highest 55 while vice-captain Mushfiqur Rahim made 32 and all-rounder Naeem Islam 17. The one-day series from Aug 9-18 will be played at Bulawayo. Teams: Bangladesh: Shakib Al Hasan (capt), Mushfiqur Rahim (vice-capt), Tamim Iqbal, Junaed Siddique, Mohammad Ashraful, Raqibul Hassan, Mahmudullah Riyad, Naeem Islam, Syed Rasel, Nazmul Hossain, Enamul Haque Jr, 12th man: Mehrab Hossain Jr Zimbabwe A: Tatenda Taibu (capt), Brendan Taylor, Chamu Chibhabha, Friday Kasteni, Bothwell Chapungu, Forster Mutizwa, Timycen Maruma, Chris Mpofu, Shingi Masakadza, Admire Manyumwa, Natsai Mushangwe, Tafadzwa Kamungozi (12th man), Trevor Garwe (13th
