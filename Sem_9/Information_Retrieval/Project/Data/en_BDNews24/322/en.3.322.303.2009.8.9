<TITLE> World first as Bangladesh, UK launch joint climate change inquiry </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh and the UK have teamed up to launch a first-of-its-kind climate change inquiry to gain a better insight on how two countries at opposite ends of the spectrum - one a Least Developed Country grappling with adaptation and the other one of the richest in the developed world professing mitigation  view the challenge of "climate change equity". The inquiry report will be presented to the respective governments and at the Copenhagen climate summit at the end of the year, said a statement of the joint inquiry group on Saturday. The joint initiative has been launched by chairs of the country's two parliamentary groups on climate change and environment, Bangladesh's Saber H Chowdhury MP and the UK's Colin Challen MP, who say the need for such an inquiry is "overwhelming" They also anticipate that it will bring the issue to the fore in the Bangladesh and UK parliaments. Bangladesh, though least responsible for the problem, is a country most at threat from climate change; the UK is often regarded as one of  if the not the leader  in shaping climate change policy. Chowdhury, in the joint statement said, "Climate change for Bangladesh is a development challenge as well as a human rights and justice issue at the same time." "Whilst Bangladesh learns through local endeavour on adapting to climate change, we have so far not seen the level and type of development assistance necessary if tens of millions of people are to survive in our country." "An equitable deal in Copenhagen, as being trumpeted by many world leaders, will only be possible if we are able to have clarity and consensus on the concept of equity in climate change negotiations and this would then hopefully pave the way for resolving the burden sharing riddle." "This inquiry will bring this question into sharp focus." Challen said, "The need for this inquiry is overwhelming. There are too many generalities bandied about in climate change negotiations." "We want the result of this inquiry to be presented in Copenhagen." "Why is it, for example, that many countries with very low carbon dioxide footprints, like Bangladesh, are therefore prevented from benefiting from mechanisms like the Clean Development Mechanism?" "Bangladesh has only seen two of these projects implemented in the entire history of the CDM, which for a country of 100 million plus people is clearly inequitable." "Countries like Bangladesh did not cause climate change, but they also seem to be penalised for it. This inquiry will look at this and related issues." Evidence for the joint inquiry is called for by Oct 12 2009, and submissions in electronic form (PDF and/or HTML format), of not more than 3000 words, are sought from all who are concerned to achieve, and are working towards, an equitable and fully inclusive deal on climate change in Copenhagen. They may be sent to saberchowdhury@yahoo.com and/or colinchallenmp@parliament.uk
