 Dhaka, August 6 (bdnews24.com)  The World Bank has pledged another $160 million for construction of the Padma Bridge at Mawa, raising its total loan assistance for the project up to $460m, communications minister Syed Abul Hossain said Thursday. He said the government had some funding deficit for the nearly $2 billion bridge project. "Today, the World Bank has assured us of more assistance," Hossain told reporters after a meeting with Isabel Guerrero, visiting World Bank Vice President for the South Asia Region. "Moreover, some money that had been earmarked for the Roads and Highways Department will go to the Padma Bridge project." Guerrero said the World Bank would also continue its funding of the Roads and Highways Department as before. Finance minister AMA Muhith had said just two days earlier that the World Bank was not willing to invest anew in Bangladesh's road because of "widespread corruption". Asked about this on Thursday, Guerrero said the World Bank was now giving various countries a certain amount of loan assistance under a new framework. She said the concerned governments of the countries could spend in various sectors according to their needs. Guerrero also said her talks with communications minister Syed Abul Hossain had touched on various issues, including power, water resources, drainage and climate change. 'Final Padma Bridge design by Dec' Hossain said the draft design for the Padma Bridge will be presented on Aug 27. "It will be finalised after being vetted by the prime minister and experts from home and abroad." "The final design will be ready by year end, in December, I hope." He said if construction was completed within the scheduled time frame, the bridge would be open for all by December 2013. The bridge's construction costs have risen to around $1.9 billion from the initial estimate of $1.2 billion, according to the communications ministry and a recent statement by the finance minister. Among the other major development partners, Asian Development Bank will give $350 million in loan assistance and Islamic Development Bank will give $150 million. According to a statement of the ministry on Thursday, compensation and requisition costs for lands and property acquired for the bridge have all been paid. Hossain handed over a cheque of around Tk 87 crore to the Munshiganj deputy commissioner for the last installment of compensation. The statement said the government's gave a total of Tk 407 crore in compensation costs with the final installment. bdne
