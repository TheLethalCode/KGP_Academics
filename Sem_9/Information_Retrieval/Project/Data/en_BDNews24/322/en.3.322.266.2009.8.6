<TITLE> Expert committee to assess Tipai data </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com)An expert committee is set to review the findings of a parliamentary delegation on India's Tipaimukh Dam project, along with all other available data, and give a thorough assessment of the project's likely impact on Bangladesh. Abdur Razzak, who led the delegation to India to gather the data, told bdnews24.com at the parliament complex on Thursday that they had submitted a report to the prime minister of their findings on the trip. Razzak, who returned from New Delhi just two days ago, said his team had sought further relevant information and Indian government officials had agreed to provide Dhaka with all it required. "Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has asked the ministry to form an expert committee to review the data we gathered on the trip, and any further information that comes from India," said Razzak, who is also head of the parliamentary standing committee on water resources. He said the expert body, to be formed "very soon", would assess the likely impact, environmental or otherwise, of the dam that is slated to cross the Barak River in the India's northeastern Manipur state. 'Conceptual stage' Members of Bangladesh's parliamentary delegation, returning from India on Aug 4 (Tuesday), said the proposed dam, which has triggered widespread environmental concerns, is still at the "conceptual stage". They also said they were "100 percent convinced" that India would not implement any project that would harm Bangladesh, but Dhaka was seeking further data from the Indian government on the still controversial Tipaimukh project. Razzak said his delegation had met with India's foreign and power ministers who "categorically" assured them that the Tipaimukh dam was solely a power generation project and there would be no water diversion downstream as the project had no irrigation component to it. "India pointed out if there was any environmental disaster, it would first affect India and then Bangladesh, since the site is 210 kilometres upstream from Bangladesh," Razzak said on Tuesday. The delegation left for New Delhi on July 29 to meet the Indian ministers before departing for the site of the proposed Tipaimukh dam in the northeast state of Manipur. The site is on the cross-border Barak River, which enters into Bangladesh as the Surma and Kushiara rivers. The two rivers are lifeline for hundreds of water bodies in the greater Sylhet region of Bangladesh. The team failed to visit the site on two attempts, on July 31 and Aug 2, as their helicopter could not land due to bad weather. But, they said, they had been able to view the site from the air. Delegations members said India is yet to start any construction at Tipaimukh. Three members said they believed the project's future was "not even certain." One member said the project site was so mountainous that it was "almost impossible to take construction materials there". The delegation's main aim, Razzak told bdnews24.com before leaving for India, was to obtain India's firm word that the dam would not be used for irrigation purposes that could divert precious water resources from Bangladesh. India had already said on a number of occasions the dam would not withhold water, but environmentalists and the people of Bangladesh, as well as Manipur state, remain concerned over the probable impact of the contentious project. Bangladesh's main opposition BNP has also been among the loudest critics of the proposed Indian dam, although they failed to take up the offer of sending two MPs as part of the parliamentary delegation to India.
