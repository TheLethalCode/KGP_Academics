<TEXT>
 LONDON, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Chelsea will not be signing or selling anyone else in the remaining weeks of the transfer window, manager Carlo Ancelotti said on Friday. "We stay with these players," the Italian told a news conference ahead of Sunday's community shield clash at Wembley between the FA Cup holders and Premier League champions Manchester United. "I don't want to take other players because I think that the squad is very competitive at Chelsea. We don't need other players," he added. Chelsea have added striker Daniel Sturridge, defender Yuri Zhirkov and goalkeeper Ross Turnbull to their ranks in the close season and had a bid for AC Milan's Andrea Pirlo rejected with the midfielder now staying in Italy. Equally important has been tying striker Didier Drogba and midfielder Florent Malouda to new contracts, while Chelsea and England captain John Terry is staying at Stamford Bridge after an approach from Manchester City was rejected. Ancelotti also said there had been no bids for Portugal's Brazilian-born playmaker Deco or defender Ricardo Carvalho despite Inter Milan's former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho saying the London club was making it difficult to sign the pair. "We never thought to sell Carvalho and Deco. They are important players for Chelsea. Carvalho is a very intelligent defender and Deco has great quality and the team needs this," Ancelotti said. "Now we don't have the idea to sell any players. If a player is not happy to stay with us then they have to tell us but no player has asked to leave."

Asked if the Portugal winger's absence would work to Chelsea's advantage, Ancelotti said: "More relaxed without Ronaldo? No, not more relaxed". "I think if we play against Manchester (United), Manchester was not only Ronaldo. Manchester are a great team with very good players without Ronaldo. "(It's a) very difficult match but we arrive at this match very excited, very happy to be in a beautiful stadium..." "It is not a friendly game, it is a very important game for us. We play against a great team... we have respect for this team but we want to win." Ancelotti's hopes of victory and a psychological boost for the league title battle ahead is helped by having just one injury concern over Zhirkov, who has a knee problem. United's injury list includes goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar plus defenders Nemanja Vidic, Gary Neville and Wes B
