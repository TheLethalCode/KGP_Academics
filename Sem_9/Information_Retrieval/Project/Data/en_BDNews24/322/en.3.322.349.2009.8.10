<TITLE> 400,000 illegal Rohingyas in Bangladesh: Dipu Moni </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com)Foreign minister Dipu Moni, in a statement Sunday, said around 400,000 illegal Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh have been causing law and order to slide and environmental damage. The foreign ministry statement was released after a meeting between Dipu Moni and Raymond Hall, regional representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Both Dipu Moni and Hall agreed that Myanmar must improve its internal environment to stop influx of Rohingya refugees into Bangladesh and other neighbouring countries, according to the statement. The foreign minister also expressed the hope that the authorities in former Burma would take the refugees back considering its relations with Bangladesh. "Dipu Moni mentioned that some 28,000 registered refugees were living in two camps, but said nearly 400,000 unregistered refugees living outside the camps are a heavy burden on Bangladesh economically, socially, environmentally and also in terms of law and order issues," said the statement. She said despite severe resource constraints, Bangladesh did a good job in providing basic needs to the refugees for the last three decades. "The foreign minister told the UNHCR representative that the continuous flow of illegal entrants was causing huge damage to our scarce land, forest and other resources. "Deterioration of law and order situation has also been a major concern in Cox's Bazar district due to illegal activities carried out by these illegal entrants from Myanmar," said the statement. "Both Dipu Moni and the UNHCR representative agreed that it was necessary to create favourable conditions within Myanmar for repatriation of the refugees. "She also mentioned that some of the refugees repatriated on earlier occasions had sneaked back into Bangladesh," the statement said. The foreign minister was quoted by the statement as saying that Bangladesh wanted to finalise the repatriation of all remaining Myanmar refugees to their traditional homeland as soon as possible, and she sought UNHCR assistance in this long-standing issue. Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees, a Muslim ethnic minority in neighbouring Myanmar, crossed the border in waves to take refuge in Bangladesh as the military junta there launched massive crackdowns on them in the 1970s and 1990s to divert international focus from its internal troubles. Over the years, Bangladesh, with the help of the UNHCR, has sent many back to their homeland in Myanmar's Northern Rakhine State near the border. But, Bangladesh says, the majority have re-intruded due to oppression and bad governance in the isolated South East Asian nation. In a diplomatic letter last year, Myanmar denied the refugees in Bangladesh were their citizens. Foreign minister Dipu Moni visited Myanmar earlier this year, however, and secured an assurance from the military junta that it would take the refugees back. Rehabilitation Earlier in the day, Hall met with food and disaster management minister Abdur Razzak, who said the only permanent solution for the Rohingya refugees lies in rehabilitating them in their own country. To this end, the government was taking initiatives to come to a solution through bi-lateral talks, Razzak told reporters after the meeting. Bangladesh has sheltered many of the refugees, considering their plight on humane grounds, he said. "But unregistered Rohingyas are spreading across the country." "It is creating pressure on the country's limited resources. And, various social problems are emerging." He said the refugees believe they can get aid from international agencies if they come to Bangladesh, as well as settle permanently. 'No rights in their own country' The UNHCR representative said Rohingyas are deprived of citizen rights in their own country. Hall said they cannot move beyond their own village for restrictions on their movement, and must even take permission from their government to get married. He said Rohingyas come to Bangladesh to be spared religious and ethnic persecution and oppression. He said the government of Myanmar is now permitting the UNHCR to work there. The UNHCR has taken various initiatives in improving the areas where Rohingyas live, said Hall. He also said Bangladesh should attempt register all Rohingyas refugees in and out of camps, otherwise Myanmar could refuse to take back all of its nationals once a solution was reached. bdnews
