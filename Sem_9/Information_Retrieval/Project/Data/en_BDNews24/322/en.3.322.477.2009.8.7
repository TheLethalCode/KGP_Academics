 Dhaka, Aug 07 (bdnews24.com)Graduates from the PathshalaSouth Asian Institute of Photography are not recognised by Bangladeshi universities, especially the University of Dhaka that has its photography programme run by Pathshala teachers, the head of the institute says. "The Dhaka university requests our faculties to teach their film and photography course but our academic programmes," photographer Shahidul Alam, the principal said on its Graduation Day on Friday. A good number of Pathshala graduates have gone to foreign universities for do their masters degree in recent times, he added. Nobel laureate Mohammad Yunus said that photography has brought fame for Bangladesh in the global arena. "From what I have seen here, I would say this institute is providing world-class education on this art." Yunus, who awarded certificates to the graduating photographers, said that photographs can depict a situation far better than it will take a thousand words to. "We all remember how the world protested against the Vietnam war after the photo of a little girl running was published." The graduation ceremony also launched a book of photographs titled Perspectives. A photography exhibition with same title was also inaugurated by Yunus as part of the school's annual exhibition and certificate-awarding ceremony.
