 Abdur Rahim Harmachhi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com)27-year old Sanwar Hossain is the managing director of SKS Sweater Factory, a small knitwear factory ensconced at Hijalhati in Fulbaria of Gazipur. The former garment worker started out with two machines in April, and is now in full swing with 18 machines and 15 workers. Sanwar plans to expand even more over the next five years. "I hope there will be 400 machines in my factory with 600 workers supporting 600 families." However, his plans will be in tatters if he does not get the money for the expansion. Rebuffed by banks, Sarwar was forced to turn to the local NGOs to get a loan on high interests. "Banks will not lend without collateral so I went to the NGOs. I hope to employ eight more machines if I get the money," he said. Despite significant role small and medium enterprises (SME) play, most banks do not lend money to SME entrepreneurs that much. Allegation is there that they are not abiding by the rules of Bangladesh Bank that asks them to lend 40 percent of the distributed loans to SMEs and women entrepreneurs, a rule that was introduced during the past caretaker government. According to the latest data of the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB), export earning was $ 14 billion in the 2008-09 fiscal year that includes more than $ 6 billion from the knitwear sector. Sanwar worked for 14 years in a garment factory, and then embarked on his dream to become a big businessman with Tk 40,000 as capital, and honesty, integrity and confidence to draw on. It has become difficult for the small factories to stay afloat because of the chilling global recession, said Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BKMEA) president Fazlul Hoque. "These factories should be helped out from the government's Tk 5,000 crore fund for recession-hit sectors," he said. Factories and owners such as Sanwar do need to be helped out. "I heard something about the global recession but didn't think about it that much. My job is to supply to big factories under sub-contracts," he told bdnews24.com on Thursday. However, the workload went down with the falling orders and reduced payment. "Earlier the factories used to pay Tk 25 for each sweater but now they are paying not more than Tk 20 for the same," he added. On top of this, Sanwar's factory is suffering from seven to eight hours of power outage in a day. "I have to use a generator that costs me Tk 50 per hour, an extra expense," he said. Sanwar's wife, Jorina Akhter, works in his factory as an operator. "I hope that my husband will become a big businessman in future and I'll be able to raise my son properly," said Jorina, a supporter of Sanwar's dreams. "Even though it's my husband's factory, I take my salaries and incentives every month. It amounts to Tk 8,000-9,000 including overtimes," she said. "Sanwar and I used to work in the same factory before. Now I am happy to work in his factory," said Selim Mahmud, a worker. "I started working after a one-month training here. Now I get Tk 4,000 a month," said Shimu Akhter, another worker. bdnews2
