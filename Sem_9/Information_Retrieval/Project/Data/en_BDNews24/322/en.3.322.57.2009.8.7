 MOSCOW, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - About 30,000 people are still displaced from the five-day war between Moscow and Tbilisi which erupted a year ago when Georgian forces attacked breakaway South Ossetia, Amnesty International said on Friday. The London-based rights group said the displaced, mostly ethhic Georgians, lack basic services and suffer hardship from the de facto borders dividing the pine-covered enclave and Georgia proper, which were established after the conflict when Moscow recognised South Ossetia as independent.

The rebel region's administration says South Ossetia today has a population of 63,000, and that several thousand ethnic Ossetians are still homeless.
