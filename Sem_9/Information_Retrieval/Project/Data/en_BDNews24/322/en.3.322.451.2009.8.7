 Dhaka, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh could acquire a significant share in the global market for IT Outsourcing through public private partnership projects with developed countries like Japan, says a visiting IT specialist from Osaka City University. Bangladesh has potential to build a strong ITO industry, said Professor Keiko Morisawa, of the Graduate School for Creative Cities under Osaka City University, speaking at a workshop on ICT services development by the Embassy of Japan at a Dhaka hotel on Thursday. Morisawa suggested following the recent example of the Philippines and also Vietnam, who since 2005 have rapidly secured significant shares in the highly lucrative global ITO industry. ITO (IT Outsourcing), BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) and KPO (Knowledge Process Outsourcing) include offshore services such as call and contact centres, back office support, transcription, animation, software, website and game development, as well as software engineering. Morisawa also said Japan is offering to train up overseas students to increase human resources in the global IT industry and aims to welcome 3 million students by around 2020 as a part of a 'global strategy' Currently, China leads among Japan's offshore destinations for ITO, BPO, KPO services, followed by India, Philippines and Vietnam. Globally, the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) are predominant in this offshore service industry. The total value of transactions among these countries (both direct and indirect) in 2008 was $1b. But BRIC countries faced recent problems, Brazil and China could not utilise their potential and Russia lacks government support, which is where Philippines and Vietnam secured their place, said Morisawa. She said non-BRIC countries like Philippines were successful as they emphasised IT education and chose cooperation with India over competition. Vietnam ensured success by developing IT education and cooperation with Japan through both private and public partnership. There is also a scope for Myanmar and Bangladesh to follow their examples, she said. She suggested Bangladesh should pursue the Philippines' example in particular for near-shoring with BRIC countries, specifically India. It should also be keen to get BPO (Business Process Outsourcing), not only ITO (IT Outsourcing) work orders. Bangladesh could also increase offshore work orders directly from Japan by developing ITEE (IT Engineers Exam) skill standards, which is globally recognised and a must to get into the BPO market, she said.
