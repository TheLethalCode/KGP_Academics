<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court on Thursday allowed a High Court bail order to stand for leader of the opposition, BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, in the Barapukuria coalmine graft case. A three-judge bench led by chief justice MM Ruhul Amin rejected the Anticorruption Commission's petition seeking leave to appeal against the High Court bail. The anti-graft body filed the case against Khaleda and 15 others on Feb 26, 2008, accusing them of causing state losses totalling Tk 158.71 crore through mismanagement and mishandling of the Barapukuria coalmine. The High Court granted Khaleda bail for four months on Aug 28, 2008, and later extended the order. bdne
