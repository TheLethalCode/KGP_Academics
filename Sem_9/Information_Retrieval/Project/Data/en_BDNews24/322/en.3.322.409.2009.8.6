 Dhaka, August 6 (bdnews24.com) - Violence between two groups of Bangladesh Chhatra League activists over control of a room at Dhaka University's Surja Sen Hall left at least a dozen people injured on Thursday. DU proctor Saiful Islam Khan told bdnews24.com a probe committee would be formed to identify those responsible. Khan said police, deployed to calm the situation and investigate the incident, recovered sticks, metal bars and other such weapons from a room at the hall. Dhaka University's BCL committee in a statement said it had suspended seven activists of its Surja Sen Hall unit in connection with the violence. Students who witnessed the clash on campus said those involved had also used sharp weapons. They said the formation, after seven years, of new BCL units in eleven DU halls on July 30 had created friction on campus. The previous units had held sway since 2002. Students said tensions had heightened over the previous two or three days between supporters of BCL president Syed Majumdar and general secretary Ziaul Haq Tuhin over the control of Room 203 on the first floor of the hall. Supporters of Majumdar and Tuhin, armed with sticks, metal bars and sharp weapons, met in a violent clash at around midday Thursday. At least 12 injured students had to be treated at the university medical centre and Dhaka Medical College Hospital, said witnesses. "Those who are responsible for disrupting the peace of the campus will not be allowed to go unpunished," said Khan. "We are examining the available evidence." bdn
