Foreign minister Dipu Moni, speaking as chief guest at a regional conference on 'Empowerment of Women Human Rights Defenders', stressed special security needs for poor and deprived women to ensure elimination of violence. Human rights group Odhikar organised the conference at the BRAC Centre Inn with participants from South and South East Asia.

She said the government has recently launched the Bangladesh Human Rights Commission and initiated a national action plan for women rights. Dipu Moni, the former women affairs secretary for ruling Awami League, also acknowledged the contribution of Women Human Rights Defenders, and said the government would take proper steps to ensure their social and administrative support. Odhikar president CR Abrar called for amending inheritance laws to eliminate the gender discrimination within the society. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam termed the distribution of property under Muslim family laws "discriminatory" but said it was a "complex" issue.
