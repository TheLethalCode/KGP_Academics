 Khagrachhari, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com)  Three more army camps were dismantled in Khagrachhari district Saturday as part of the government's move to withdraw a full brigade from the Chittagong Hill Tracts, the largest single pullout of troops in the region since a peace accord was signed in 1997. The Dainchhari army camp, at Moghaichhari in Laxmichhari Upazila, and Dashbil and Gachchabil army camps, in Manikchhari Upazila, under Guimara Brigade were withdrawn, said officials. They said the camps accounted for 120 army personnel, including Ansar members, who were brought back to the Guimara Brigade's headquarters in Matiranga Upazila. Makeshift Dadanchhari and Dashibil army camps were withdrawn at around midday, deputy commissioner Mohammad Abdullah told bdnews24.com. Gachchabil camp pulled out later in the day, said officials there. The pullout process of the Guimara Brigade started on Friday, with dismantling of the army camp at Mohalchhari Union in Manikchhari Upazila. The government, on July 29, announced the "immediate" withdrawal of one complete brigade, from the total five brigades deployed in the hill districts to resume implementation of the 1997 CHT Peace Accord. It said the withdrawal would be complete by September. The withdrawal of the Guimara Brigade involves dismantling of 35 army camps scattered through the three CHT districts. Of these, 13 were in Khagrachhari district. Abdullah said the rest of the camps will be withdrawn in phases over the coming month. bdn
