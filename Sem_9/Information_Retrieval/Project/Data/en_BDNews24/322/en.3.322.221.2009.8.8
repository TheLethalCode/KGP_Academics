 Sayedul Islam Talat bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation website will soon be available in up to eight languages, including Bangla, as part of an online makeover to better the tourism needs of domestic and foreign travellers. The website of the state-owned agency is English-language only at present. It will be available in Bangla, English and Japanese from November. Five more international languages will be included in phases, BPC executive officer (IT) Ehsanul Kabir Bappi told bdnews24.com on Friday. "Besides new languages we have plans to modernise the website. There will be attractive video clips along with high resolution photographs on the country's special tourism attractions." "The site will also contain web links of private travel companies and special features on local food," said Kabir. He said they had especially considered private tour operators in the new web design. "One will be able to get all information including contact numbers, email addresses of the private operators on the new site." "We are modernising the website keeping in mind it should be the first site that people in Bangladesh and foreign countries browse prior to travel," he said. The new moves have been taken at the suggestion of civil aviation and tourism minister GM Kader, he added. BPC is likely to sign an agreement with private organisation Connectbd Limited this week to implement the project within three months starting from August, said Kabir. "We are also discussing some funding of the project with a private mobile phone operator." The current website is not available on mobile internet, he said. "One will be able to browse the new site on mobile phones allowing people to get information from anywhere," Kabir said. BPC authorities has also finalised online reservation systems through credit cards. "We are waiting for government approval," said Kabir. Reagrding the inclusion of Japanese, before other world languages, he said: "We get many emails and letters from Japan every year." "They come to Bangladesh to visit special Buddhist sites such as Paharpur monastery and temples in the hill tracts region." BPC is operating its current website through a Singapore server, Singtel, with support from Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Limited.
