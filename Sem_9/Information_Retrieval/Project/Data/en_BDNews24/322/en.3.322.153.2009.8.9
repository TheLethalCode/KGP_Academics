<TITLE> 400,000 illegal Rohingya refugees a burden on Bangladesh: Dipu Moni </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Bangladesh Dhaka, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com)Foreign minister Dipu Moni, in a statement Sunday, said around 400,000 illegal Rohingya refugees living in Bangladesh have been causing law and order to slide and environmental damage. The foreign ministry statement was released after a meeting between Dipu Moni and Raymond Hall, regional representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Both Dipu Moni and Hall agreed that Myanmar must improve its internal environment to stop influx of Rohingya refugees into Bangladesh, according to the statement. The foreign minister also expressed the hope that the authorities in former Burma would take the refugees back considering its friendly relations with Bangladesh. "Dipu Moni mentioned that some 28,000 registered refugees were living in two camps, and nearly 400,000 unregistered refugees living outside the camps are a heavy burden on Bangladesh economically, socially environmentally and also in terms of law and order issues," said the statement. She said despite severe resource constraints, Bangladesh did a good job in providing basic needs to the Myanmar refugees for the last three decades. "The foreign minister told the UNHCR representative that the continuous flow of illegal entrants was causing huge damage to our scarce land, forest and other resources. "Deterioration of law and order situation has also been a major concern in Cox's Bazar district due to illegal activities carried out by these illegal entrants from Myanmar," said the statement. "Both Dipu Moni and the UNHCR representative agreed that it was necessary to create favourable conditions within Myanmar for repatriation of the refugees. "She also mentioned that some of the refugees repatriated on earlier occasions had sneaked back into Bangladesh," the statement said. The foreign minister was quoted by the statement as saying that Bangladesh wanted to finalise the repatriation of all remaining Myanmar refugees to their traditional homeland as soon as possible, and she sought UNHCR assistance in this regard. Hundreds of thousands of Muslim Rohingya refugees from neighbouring Myanmar crossed the border and took refuge in Bangladesh as the military junta there launched a massive crackdown on them in the late 1990s to divert international focus from its internal troubles. Over the years Bangladesh, with the help of the UNHCR, sent most of them back to their homeland in the Northern Rakhain state in Myanmar, but the majority of them have re-intruded into Bangladesh due to bad governance there. In a diplomatic letter Myanmar last year denied the Rohingyas were their citizens. Foreign minister Dipu Moni visited Myanmar earlier this year, and secured an assurance from the military junta that it would take the refugees back.
