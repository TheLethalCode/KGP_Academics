<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com)State minister for health Mojibur Rahman Fakir said on Sunday that rumours of a first fatality from swine flu in the country were false, and had arisen from an incorrectly filled out death certificate. Rumour of the possible swine flu fatality spread following the death of Sanowar Hossain, who returned from the Maldives on Saturday feeling unwell. "The reason for death was incorrectly written in the individual's death certificate," Dr Shahjahan Biswas, director of Uttara Modern Medical College and Hospital, told bdnews24.com. Dr Biswas said the death was attributed to pneumonia in the death certificate, although an additional comment in brackets had contained the words 'Swine Flu'. "We are certain the reason for this individual's death was not swine flu, although he was suffering from a fever and asthma," said state minister Fakir. A committee has been formed to investigate the case, headed by Dr Mahmudur Rahman, director of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) and a joint secretary of the health ministry. Dr Rahman told bdnews24.com laboratory tests and a review of the patient's case notes had proven the death was not attributable to swine flu. "Results of his blood tests and case history did not match the symptoms of swine flu, although he had been suffering from a fever for the last 15 days," said Dr Rahman. He said patients suffering from swine flu typically get well within 10 days. "We'll investigate why swine flu was written on the death certificate," said Dr Rahman. The victim's body was returned to his home in Moheshchandrapur in Singra upazila early Sunday, and was buried under the supervision of local health officials, the local bdnews24.com correspondent reports. Few people attended the Janaza due to concerns over possible infection, he said. Local health officials have kept 12 individuals who attended the service under supervision, said the Singra health supervisor, who added the individuals would be examined soon for possible symptoms. Abdul Gafur, the father of Sanowar Hossain, said his son became ill while in the Maldives, but was sent to Bangladesh without receiving any treatment. According to the IEDCR, some 32 cases of swine flu have been identified in the country so far, of which 28 have made a complete recovery. The rest remain under supervision. According to the World Health Organisation, as of July 31, over 134,000 cases of swine flu have been detected in 161 countries worldwide, with 861 recorded fatalities. WHO declared a global swine flu pandemic on June 11, while the health ministry confirmed the first case in Bangladesh on June 19. Symptoms of the virus include fever with high temperature and respiratory problems. IEDCR advises schools and offices to grant leave to anyone who displays symptoms of the flu. It also advises people to refrain from spitting and to wash their hands regularly to curb the spread of the swine flu virus. bd
