<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com)Shipping minister Shahjahan Khan said on Saturday the government is considering the gradual reinstatement of former employees of Chittagong Port who were sacked during the tenure of the caretaker government. "Efforts will be made to give back these workers their jobs in a logical way," Khan told reporters after separate meetings with local MPs, port officials and former port employees at the Chittagong Port administrative building. The announcement follows a campaign by the sacked port employees that gained pace after the Awami League-led alliance came to power at the start of the year. Khan, who took office as shipping minister on July 31, as part of a cabinet reshuffle, said national interests and not party politics would determine how the county's ports were run. Speaking to stakeholders in the port for the first time since taking over the ministry, he also said workers' politics should not affect the smooth operation of the port. "The government has never spoken out against trade unions, they should be part of the port's operations, but in two separate partsthe collective bargaining agent and the workers unions," said Khan. He said the government was modernising Chittagong and Mongla ports to promote economic activity in the country. Khan met with chairman of Chittagong Port Commodore RU Ahmed and other port authority officials as well as leaders of different organisations under the umbrella of Chittagong Port Dock Workers' Federation. The minister also said the government was also planning construction of a 250-bed cardiac hospital in the Chittagong Port area. b
