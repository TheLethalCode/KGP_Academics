 Dhaka, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com)Millions of Bangladeshis observed Shab-e-Barat on Thursday night, the night that brings annual hopes of forgiveness and good fortune amid traditional festivities. People visited the graveyards of their relatives and saints and gave out sweets and foods among the poor, neighbours, friends and relatives. Muslims believe that God reviews all people's past deeds on the night, one of the most sacred of the Islamic calendar, and determines the fortune of each human being for the coming year. Muslims throughout the country thronged mosques from sunset, or prepared in their homes, to pray for forgiveness through 'the night of fortune'. Devotees offered prayers, recited from the Quran and perform doa throughout the night to seek God's mercy, blessing and goodwill. The Islamic Foundation and other religious organisations organised Qurankhwani, milad mahfil and discussions. It has also become a long-standing social event for Muslims in the Indian subcontinent, Bangladesh in particular, who observe the occasion with great festivity. People prepared special foods such as breads, a variety of sweetmeats and halua. They distributed these to relatives and neighbours through the day in what has become a recent tradition. The festive foods re also distributed among the poor irrespective of religion and caste. . President Zillur Rahman and prime minister Sheikh Hasina gave special messages on the occasion. "The auspicious night of Shab-e-Barat brings a special opportunity for mankind to receive blessings and mercy from Allah," said the president. Saying Islam was a religion of peace, he called on Muslims to pray on the holy night for national prosperity and unity. Hasina in her message said: "Allah forgives those who seek mercy from Him and grants the prayers of His creation on the night called the night of fortune." She urged all to work sincerely for the welfare of mankind and to build a country imbued with teachings of this night. Also known as Lailatul Barat, the special night falls on the 15th of the month of Sha'ban, of the Arabic Hijri calendar, ahead of the holy month of Ramadan. b
