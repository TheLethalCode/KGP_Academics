 Chittagong, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com)Shipping minister Shahjahan Khan has assured businessmen of a 'rational' cut in tariff and charge at Chittagong port. "It was not right to up raise 300 times the tariff and charge of the port after 21 years," the minister told port users in a meeting on Sunday at the Chittagong Port Authority office. "The rates will be cut rationally following the demand of the businessmen," he said. The port authorities raised tariff and charge during the last caretaker government since it was set in 1986. Khan asked the officials to beef up security in the port to prevent pilferage. "Arrangement should be made to deploy security guards if needed," he said. Seventy of the 200 army personnel stationed at the port were removed recently. On the issue, the minister said: "We will take steps to increase the presence of army members. We will not allow any disruption in the security system." Commerce minister Faruq Khan who joined the meeting late asked officials to ensure that shipment of essential commodities is done fast. "If the prices of essential commodities go up importers do not pay the price. It's the customers who have to face the price hike," he said. CPA chairman commodore RU Ahmed, BGMEA first vice president Nasiruddin Chowdhury, Bangladesh Shipping Association president Ahsanul Haque Chowdhury were among those present in the meeting. bdnew
