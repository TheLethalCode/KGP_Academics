 Dhaka, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com)The International Day of the World's Indigenous People is being observed in Bangladesh on Sunday with the call for "constitutional recognition" of 45 indigenous communities. Demands for restoration of lands and withdrawal of "army rule" from the hill districts for full implementation of the 1997 Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord were also made. The United Nations General Assembly in a resolution on Dec 23, 1994 decided to observe the day during the International Decade of the World's Indigenous People.

Larma , who is also chairman of the CHT Regional Council, has called for a roadmap for implementation of the Peace Accord that was signed more than two decades ago.
