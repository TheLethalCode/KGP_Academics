 Dhaka, Aug 09 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary watchdog has asked the government to set up a state-run expatriates welfare bank, which would also run commercial banking activities, by the end of the year. "We have told the ministry to set up the proposed bank for expatriate workers by this year," Anisul Islam Mahmood, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on the expatriates welfare ministry, told bdnews24.com after a meeting Sunday. Mahmood said the bank would be state-owned and managed by a board of trustees like the Trust Bank. Expatriates welfare and overseas employment minister Khondker Mosharraf Hossain and senior Bangladesh Bank officials attended the standing committee meeting. "In line with opinions of Bangladesh Bank officials, the committee has suggested the bank must also have other commercial banking activities to make it viable." Prime minister Sheikh Hasina, on coming to power, had pledged setting up of a specialised bank for the needs of overseas workers. Mahmood said the proposed bank would also support special schemes of expatriates after their return to the country if they came up with specific proposals . "The bank will help them with special loans after their return from overseas," he said. The government has also agreed to a separate proposal by non-resident Bangladeshis who want to invest in a similar private sector venture. Manpower in Mauritius On a separate issue, Mahmood said the Bangladesh envoy in Kenya was pursuing the Mauritius government to press it to changing a decision on sending 6,000 Bangladeshi workers back home. "Officials of the expatriates welfare ministry told us that the Mauritius government may consider changing their previous decision and allow Bangladeshis workers to remain there," said the chairman. "We have also asked the ministry to explore other labour markets for the workers who may loose jobs in Mauritius," said Mahmood. Mauritius ordered 6,000 Bangladeshi workers earlier this year to leave the Island nation in the India Ocean due to economic crisis there.
