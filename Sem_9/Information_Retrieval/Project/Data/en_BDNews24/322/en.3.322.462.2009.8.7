 NEW DELHI, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian strike bowler Zaheer Khan has undergone shoulder surgery and is likely to miss next month's triangular one-day series in Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy in South Africa, local media reported on Friday. Zaheer had the operation in South Africa last month and could be out for up to five months, the Times of India reported. There was no immediate confirmation from the cricket board or the player, who reportedly wanted to keep the information from the media to avoid enquiries during his initial recovery. The 30-year-old left-arm bowler suffered the injury while fielding during the Indian Premier League earlier this year, though still played in the World Twenty20 in England in June, the newspaper said. He subsequently missed a four-match one-day series in West Indies. The Indian team for the Sri Lankan triangular series, which also involves New Zealand, and the Champions Trophy is scheduled to be named on August 16. The triangular series will be played from September 8-14 while the Champions Trophy is from September 22-October 5.
