 PASADENA, Calif. Aug 9,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Paula Abdul may be out of a job on "American Idol" but she could soon be dancing with the stars on rival TV network ABC.

Fox, which will air the new show in January, said singer Katy Perry was among a number of other female artists it was recruiting for guest judge spots while it searched for a permanent replacement for Abdul.
