 PARIS Fri Aug 7, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Nicolas Sarkozy piled pressure on banks to refrain from paying substantial bonuses to traders by summoning them on Friday to a meeting on an issue which has generated controversy in France. Sarkozy instructed top banking executives to report to him on August 25 on their bonus policies, as well as on whether they were living up to commitments to keep credit flowing to businesses and families, a statement from his office said. "The president wants to make sure that French banks are following the rules agreed at the London G20, particularly in terms of remuneration," the statement said, adding that Sarkozy wanted these rules to be applied "firmly." At a summit in April, G20 leaders had promised to implement "tough new principles on pay and compensation." Sarkozy wants the next G20, scheduled for September 24-25 in the U.S. city of Pittsburgh, to revisit the issue and adopt a tougher stance. Outrage over bonuses, which many voters see as a provocation from a sector held responsible for the economic crisis, was rekindled this week when it emerged BNP Paribas had set aside 1 billion euros ($1.44 billion) for possible bonus payments. France's biggest bank by market capitalization, which reported a 6.6 percent rise in second quarter profits, has defended its bonus provision, saying it was in line with commitments demanded at the London G20. This failed to placate politicians, trade unionists and the media who spent the week portraying bankers as irredeemably greedy and unable to learn from their mistakes. Earlier this year, the government, major banks and the market watchdog agreed on a deal that stipulated, among other things, there should be no guaranteed bonuses. But no law was passed to that effect, even though the government last year set up a rescue package worth 360 billion euros in taxpayer money. "RULES HAVE CHANGED" The cause of bankers also was not helped by news on Thursday of an insider trading probe against two Societe Generale executives, including one who was already implicated in a rogue trading scandal last year. Appearing on France 2 state television on Friday, SocGen Chief Executive Frederic Oudea was subjected to a volley of questions on bonuses. He defended them as necessary to stop good staff from defecting to foreign rivals. "The same rules have to be applied everywhere, otherwise these activities will move, will leave Paris and go elsewhere." Sarkozy's statement piled the pressure on banks after similarly worded communiques from Prime Minister Francois Fillon and Economy Minister Christine Lagarde earlier in the week. Fillon was due to meet some of the top bankers on Friday. "Bankers, collectively, have to understand that this is a new era and we're not playing by the same rules anymore," Lagarde said on Europe 1 radio. European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet, questioned on the subject of bonuses during an interview on RTL radio, said there had been "absurd" practices in the past but defended bonuses as "norm
