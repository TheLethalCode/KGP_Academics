 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com)The Awami League government has started recalling armed forces officers who it says were sacked by the previous BNP-led government on political considerations. Defence committee chairman Idris Ali MP told bdnews24.com on Thursday that a list of "victimised" officers was sent to prime minister Sheikh Hasina last month who ordered their reinstatement "after thorough investigation". "The ministry officials have informed us that the government has already started reinstating the officials sacked by the previous BNP government for political reasons," Ali said after chairing a meeting of the parliamentary standing committee on the defence ministry. Ali did not mention how many officials of the armed forces were found to have been sacked for such reason or the number to be recalled, but it was his standing committee that had recommended reinstating the officials in a meeting on July 14. He said the government would also promote the officials who were deprived of advancement by the BNP government that was in power from 2001-2006. Another committee member, Monzur Quader Quraishi, told bdnews24.com, "The BNP government dismissed army officers whose relatives were involved in opposition politics". "The government will also award them overdue promotions," said Quraishi. Neither the defence ministry nor headquarters of the armed forces have disclosed any information relating to sacking of its officers on political grounds. Pat media reports, however, have suggested that at least 14 officers of the armed forces, equivalent to the rank of major general, were sacked between October 2001, when BNP government took office, up to 2003. Peace keeping The standing committee at its meeting Thursday also decided to visit the Republic of Congo and Ivory Coast to see the contribution of the Bangladeshi peace keeping forces. "The members of the standing committee members will go to Congo and Ivory Coast by December to gain first hand information on activities and experiences of Bangladeshi peace keepers there. "We will see the contribution of the Bangladeshi peace keepers to the restoration of democracy in the Republic of Congo which is preparing for an election amid warring of different factions," said Idris Ali. Ali said Bangladesh had new peace keeping offers for 3,500 troops, but could not meet the demands for logistical reasons. "We will recommend the government provide necessary equipment and other logistic support to send more peace keepers abroad," he said. Committee members Muhammad Jamiruddin Sircar and Mujibul Huq, and Abdul Mannan attended the meeting as the representative of Sheikh Hasina, who heads the defence ministry.
