 Bandarban, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com)Two construction workers abducted Friday from Roangchharhi have been freed, a Bandarban official said Sunday. "They were freed around midnight Saturday. It couldn't be ascertained, however, if they were released in exchange for any ransom," said Md Rokon, district intelligence officer of the Bandarban police superintendent's office. Mohammad Yusuf, 35, from Sonagazi Upazila in Feni, and Mohammad Rabiul, 22, from Lalmonirhat, were kidnapped at 3pm Friday as they were overseeing construction of Gherao-Roagchhari Road under the CHT Development Project, Rokon said. Rabiul and Yusuf walked about 20-22 kms to reach Roangchharhi police station after their release, he said. "The two had been made to walk the same distance through deep jungle after their abduction on Friday, but they could not name the area they were taken to." "After they were freed Saturday night, they said they walked some of the distance and then phoned one of their colleagues, who escorted them the rest of the way to the police station," said Rokon. The contractors of the two workers, Mahabubur Rahman and Amal Das, the partners of construction firm MM Traders, could not be contacted after repeated attempts on Sunday. Das had said on Friday that no one contacted them to demand ransom. Rabiul and Yusuf, however were overheard by some as saying they had to pay Tk 1 lakh to buy their freedom. Fish farmer Mohammed Faruq, from Chhaingya Danesh Parah of Roangchhari Upazila, was kidnapped in Bandarban last Tuesday. His family members secured his release by paying a ransom him the following day. bdnews24.com/co
