<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com)The government is set to start the trials of war criminals soon, Awami League general-secretary Syed Ashraful Islam said on Saturday, a day after the Sector Commander's Forum expressed doubt that the trials were on track. The AL leader's comments also follow the government's request on July 30 to international organisations and countries to help it with more evidence and documents for the trial of war crimes committed in the 1971 Liberation War. "The war criminals started gaining strength after the killing of Bangabandhu," Ashraful told AL leaders and activists from Hosainpur Upazila in Kishoreganj. He said the people of the country did not want to see war criminals become cabinet ministers in the future. Ashraful, who is also the local government and rural development minister, said the AL had come to power to put an end to the misrule of the BNP-Jamaat government. "The carnage at the BDR headquarters was perpetrated to remove the elected government from power and create the conditions for a civil war just a few days after we came to power," said Ashraful. He also claimed a conspiracy existed to kill Sheikh Hasina and himself prior to the BDR mutiny. "The last BNP-Jamaat government demeaned the people of this country in the world's eyes through rampant corruption, we were taken to the verge of ruin," he said. bdnew
