 LEEDS, England, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Australia captain Ricky Ponting is looking forward to a new career highlight after his team set up an Ashes decider by humbling England in the fourth Test on Sunday. "This is the chance we have been waiting for all tour," Ponting said after Australia completed victory by an innings and 80 runs at Headingley on Sunday. "We are all very excited about it. It is going to be one of the best moments of my career and it's what cricket is all about." The teams will go into the final match of the series at the Oval starting on Aug. 20 level at 1-1. Australia only need to draw the series to retain the Ashes, leaving the onus on England to force a win. Ponting was delighted with the way Australia played at Headingley.

"This is no time to panic," Strauss said. "We shouldn't get carried away. I'd be very resistant to wholesale changes but we need a period of calm reflection to pick the best 11 players to win the game." Strauss said England usually responded well in adversity. "There is a lot of strength of character in the side and we will need it next week," he said. "The momentum of the series has swung but as a team we have always come back well from bad performances." England could be boosted by the return of all-rounder Andrew Flintoff, who was ruled out of the fourth Test just before the start of the match. "We are optimistic on Fred (Flintoff) but we will assess him carefully and hope to make an earlier decision than in this game," Strauss
