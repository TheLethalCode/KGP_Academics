 Dhaka, August 8 (bdnews24.com)The Directorate General of Health Services is preparing to train village-level workers to treat snakebite victims after a nationwide survey, the largest of its type in Bangladesh, revealed as many as 6,000 people succumb to venomous bites in the country every year. "Snakebites are one of the most neglected health hazards of the twenty-first century and is the second biggest cause of unnatural deaths after drowning," said Prof Md Ridwanur Rahman, head of the research team, at the launch of the survey findings at the CIRDAP auditorium on Saturday. Prof Rahman, also a lecturer at Suhrawardi Medical College and Hospital, said dedicated wards should be established in hospitals for the treatment of snakebites. "There are around 50 species of venomous snake in Bangladesh, including Cobra and Krait," said Rahman. He said India has seven commercial companies producing anti-venom for bites from four different kinds of snake, which also live in Bangladesh. "A new regional anti-venom initiative could be effective," he said. The survey, funded by the government and World Bank, revealed there are around 700,000 snakebite incidents every year in Bangladesh, of which approximately 6,000 are fatal. "Only three percent of bite victims go to a hospital or seek help from a trained doctor," said Abul Hasan Milton, senior professor at the University of Newcastle in Australia and member of the research team. Milton said a further six percent sought assistance from village doctors, while almost all the rest used 'Ojha', local members of the community known for their folk knowledge of snakes. "Nevertheless, around 75 percent of snakebite victims receive some kind of treatment within two hours of being bitten," said Milton. The eight-member team found the rate of snakebites was highest in Barisal, at 2,667 incidents per 100,000 of the population. In Dhaka the rate was found to be 440 per 100,000, while the lowest recorded level was in Sylhet, at 321 per 100,000. The study also revealed that recorded snakebite incidents are highest from May to October. "We can save lives if these villagers receive some training," said DGHS director-general Shah Monir Hossain. Hossain said some 3,000 doctors received training in the treatment of snakebites in 2008-09. "More initiatives will be taken at the field level in this regard," he said. Md Abul Foyez, professor of Sir Salimullah Medical College and adviser to the research team, said the survey was the largest of its type ever conducted in the country. bdne
