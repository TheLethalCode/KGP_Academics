 MELBOURNE, Aug 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Western Australia batsman has been charged with assaulting a police officer while attempting to escape custody after a bizarre hit-and-run saga ended with the man being found hiding in sand dunes by a police dog. Luke Pomersbach, who also plays with Indian Premier League team Kings XI Punjab, was suspended indefinitely by the Western Australia Cricket Association (WACA) after they were made aware of "a serious traffic incident" Sunday. Police allege Pomersbach had been driving while intoxicated and had crashed into the back of another car in western Perth. He then fled the scene and crashed into a skip bin shortly after, Australian media reported. The 24-year-old then drove away, leaving a trail of oil to his nearby home, Australian Associated Press (AAP) quoted a police spokesman as saying. "He was spoken to by police and as he was being placed in the rear of a police sedan, he informed police that he did not want to accompany them and tried to leave," spokesman Greg Lambert told the agency. "A struggle developed when police tried to restrain the man, during which a police officer was pushed back into a window of the house, causing it to break." A witness told Australian television that police had been restrained in dealing with the cricketer. "The boys were very good. They were telling him he was in trouble, to get in the car, he was being arrested and he was just having none of that," the witness said. Pomersbach then fled the scene but was later taken into custody after being tracked by a police dog and his handler in sand dunes near his house. The cricketer was also charged with "failing to stop, failing to accompany police, driving with an alcohol level in excess of 0.08... obstructing police and escaping police custody," AAP said. WACA said in a statement: "The matter will be heard in the Perth Magistrates Court Friday. Until then, Luke has been suspended from all pre-season training commitments with the Warriors (Western Australia cricket club)."
