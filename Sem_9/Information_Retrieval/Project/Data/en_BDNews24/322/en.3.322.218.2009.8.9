<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com)  A brilliant century by Mohammad Ashraful eased Bangladesh to an eight-wicket win over Zimbabwe in the first of the five-match GrameenPhone Cup ODI Series at Bulawayo's Queens Sports Club on Sunday. Tiny Ashraful stood tall to remain unbeaten on 103 off as many balls as the Tigers chased down the 208-run target in just 34.3 overs. His innings was studded with 12 glorious fours and two sixes. It was the former Bangladesh's captain third ODI hundred and first since the career-best 109 made against UAE in the 2008 Asia Cup in Lahore. Ashraful's task was made easy by the brisk start provided by the openers. Tamim Iqbal started off with two fours in the first over - a cut and an off drive - but it was Junaed Siddique who got off the block like a runaway express against Chamu Chibhaba. He hit three successive off-side boundaries in the second over, a caressed cover drive being the highlight, and followed it with two successive boundaries in the fourth over before hitting one straight to mid-off. Tamim who made an aggressive 68-ball 63 featured in a match-winning stand of 138 for the second wicket with Ashraful after Junaed was caught at deep square leg off Chibhabha for a 12-ball 21 after putting on 30 runs. In the post-match presentation, Zimbabwe captain Prosper Utseya said his batsmen should have applied themselves better early in the innings so that they could have attacked later in the innings. Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan said the boys did a very good job, and was happy with his team's performance. Ashraful, naturally named man of the match, said "My team-mates have supported me though I didn't do well in the Tests against West Indies." He added that not being captain has also reduced the burden on him and allowed him to play more freely. Earlier, Mark Vermeulen hit a fluent 92 on his comeback after five years but Bangladesh applied the squeeze to restrict Zimbabwe to 207 in 47.5 overs. While Vermeulen put a price on his wicket during his 128-ball stay, the same could not be said for his team-mates after being put into bat by Bangladesh. Vermeulen, whose previous best was 79, was eventually run out attempting a risky second run with the score on 178 in 42.2 overs. The Tigers got off to dream start after Syed Rasel accounted for Hamilton Masakadza caught by wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim off the last ball of the opening over with not a run on the board. Rasel induced an edge from Masakadza with a delivery that shaped away. The Tigers' disciplined bowling also forced Chamu Chibhaba into nicking behind off Nazmul Hossain. Apart from a third-wicket partnership of 49 runs between Vermeulen and Brendan Taylor (20), it was very much a case of wickets falling at an alarming rate throughout. Only four other Zimbabwe batsmen reached double figures. Among the Bangladesh bowlers Nazmul Hossain finished with 3-29 while Shakib Al Hasan and Mahmudullah Riyad shared four wickets. Mohammad Ashraful took one wicket. The second match of the series is on Tuesday at the same venu
