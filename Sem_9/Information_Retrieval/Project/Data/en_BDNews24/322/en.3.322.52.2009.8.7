<TEXT>
 Khagrachhari, Aug 07 (bdnews24.com)The government on Friday started what it says "the biggest withdrawal" of army from Chittagong Hill Tracts since a peace accord was signed over a decade ago to bring stability to the long-troubled region, a top district official said. The camp which was dismantled at 5pm had been set up at Joysen Parah of Manikchhari in Mohalchhari under Khagrachharhi Brigade, deputy commissioner Mohammad Abdullah said. Twelve more makeshift camps under Khagrachharhi and Guimari regions will be withdrawn later in phases, he said. The 40 members and all the logistics tents of the camp were brought under Khagrachhari Region, Abdullah said and added that the pullout started at 11am. On the withdrawal Khagrachhari Zila Parisad chairman Ruikhi Karbari said there is no possibility of deterioration of law and order if the withdrawal is made in line with the peace accord. It will a good news for all communities, he said. There are five brigades and five camps in the three CHT districts of Rangamatai, Khagrachharhi and Bandarban. On July 29, an ISPR statement had said the pullout of a complete brigade, including three infantry battalions and 35 security camps, would start immediately and added that it would end by Sept. Since the CHT peace accord was signed 12 years ago, a total of 200 security camps have been withdrawn from the tracts in different phases, according to the statement. "This will be the biggest army withdrawal from the area after the [accord was] signed," said a press release of the Inter Services Public Relations Directorate . "The government is expecting that this army withdrawal would be considered as a milestone by the hill people to implement the pledges given by the government." As part of the accord, the government pledged to pull out army troops in phases and resolve land disputes in the three hill districts. The Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord was signed in 1997 in order to end insurgency and establish permanent peace in the region. Chittagong Hill Tracts Regional Council chairman Santu Larma on Wednesday said that the Chittagong hills region would be still under army control even after announcement of the withdrawal. He asked the government to immediately declare a roadmap for the full implementation of the CHT peace accord. "The way the withdrawal of army troops from the CHT has been reported is not right at all. Only some makeshift camps have been removed," Santu, former Shantibahini militia chief, said. BNP has claimed that the withdrawal of army camps will give rise to instability in the hills region. Former BNP law minister Moudud Ahmed said on Tuesday that the partial army withdrawal was designed to clear "non-indigenous residents" from the area. Troubled region The army was deployed in the troubled region after indigenous communities, led by Chakma leaders, took up arms in the 1970s in protest against the government of a newly independent Bangladesh for its "inaction" over key demands. These included decommissioning the Kaptai hydroelectric project and restoration of traditional land rights. The Kaptai Lake, built in the 1960s, inundated the palace of the Chakma King and vast tracts of land displacing thousands of people. Many fled across the border to India to wage a campaign of insurgency against the Bangladesh Army. According to the peace deal signed with Pabatya Chattagram Janasanghati Saminit (PCJSS), the government pledged to pull out army troops from the CHT in phases. The previous Awami League government, which signed the original deal, began implementing the peace accord. But the implementation came to a halt under the subsequent BNP-led government. The withdrawal of the rest of the troops will depend on law and order there, state minister for CHT affairs Dipankar Talukder had said. bdnews
