<TEXT>
 Sylhet, Aug 07 (bdnews24.com)--Tension ran high on Friday on Sreepur border near Jaintiapur in Sylhet as the BDR resisted BSF trying to intrude and cultivate 20 acres of disputed land near pillar-1282, a BDR official said. Both Bangladesh and Indian border guards took positions and were in a belligerent mood, said Fazlur Rahman, commander of Sreepur Border Post. "BSF aided by Indian Khasia tribesmen and equipped with power tillers tried twice but could not succeed in the face of our stiff opposition," he said. Jaintiapur Union Parisad chairman Mohammad Ekhlasur Rahman said 15-20 Indian nationals backed by the BSF tried first at Minatali around 11am and then at Ami at 12pm to intrude. BSF troops of Ranghangkang and Naijuri camps strengthened their patrol, while BDR members of Sreepur camp reinforced. Earlier on Thursday, Indian nationals tried to intrude into Bangladesh through the same border area. bdn
