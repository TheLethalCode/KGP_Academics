<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman on Sunday requested banks to lower their credit and debit card charges and eliminate urban bias in offering their services. Banks should expand their services to the rural population through the application of modern technology, to help eliminate regional economic disparities, said Rahman. At the same time banks must lower their service charges to rational levels, he said. "Many people have complained to me that banks charge overly high rates on credit and debit cards," said Rahman. Banks also have to clearly inform their customers of the cost of their products and services, said Rahman, who added that charges should not be levied on different pretexts after the service has begun. The governor also called on banks to introduce debit cards for the distribution of agricultural loans and subsidies to farmers as well as other 'deserving individuals'. "It is not right that banks only extend their credit and debit card services to the urban population," said Rahman at the launch of a new National Credit and Commerce Bank debit card at the Sheraton Hotel. Reserves reach another new high Rahman said foreign reserves currently stood at an all time high of $8 billion, adding that expatriate Bangladeshis had contributed significantly to the record-breaking pot. "The Bangladesh Bank wants this reserve to help the country." "We are thinking of giving loans to exporters from this reserve, there is also the possibility of reduced interest rates for those borrowing from it," he said. He said exporters could be permitted to take loans in foreign currency from the reserve because they earned foreign exchange. They could then repay the loans in foreign exchange, he said. Rahman said this would be a win-win situation, with both parties profiting from the arrangement. Also attending the event were NCC Bank chairman Yakub Ali, managing director Nurul Amin and IT chief Tapan Kanti Sarkar. b
