 Dhaka, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com)Three workers died on Sunday while fixing window panes on the 12th floor of the 15-storey BEL Tower, the corporate headquarters of Beximco Group on Road 1 in Dhanmondi, police said. "The binding wires snapped and the hanging scaffold holding them fell on to the rooftop of a neighbouring building at around midday," New Market police chief AM Kamrul Islam told bdnews24.com. The three standing on a hanging platform outside the BEL Tower on the western face fell on the roof of a five-storey building when the hoisting mechanism holding the platform accidentally failed. The dead were identified as sub-contractor Md Mintu, 25, and workmen 'Shaheen', 24, and Ali Ahmed, 25, police said. All three men died from the fall, the police officer said, adding their heads and limbs were badly smashed.
