<TEXT>
 Chapainawabganj, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com)  Clearing and forwarding agents at Sona Masjid land port launched a three-day work abstention on Saturday in protest against "extortion" by port workers that they say disrupts normal operations of the port. All shipments from India remained stranded at the port from morning, unable to return to India or enter Bangladesh territory. Ruhul Amin, general secretary of the Sona Masjid C&F Agents Association, said they were observing the work abstention for three days between 9am to 3pm, the port's working hours, in strong protest against "extortion by the port workers coordination committee". "The committee recently started demanding Tk 750 for a fruit truck imported from India and Tk 350 for other goods and Tk 120 for the transportation of local goods." "If the authorities do not take any steps to stop extortion, our association will observe an indefinite strike from Aug 11," Amin said. Association president Shariful Islam Swadhin said they had placed a written complaint to the deputy commissioner on Aug 4 on the matter "to no avail". Harun-or-Rashid, general secretary of the port workers coordination committee, rejected the allegations of extortion. bdn
