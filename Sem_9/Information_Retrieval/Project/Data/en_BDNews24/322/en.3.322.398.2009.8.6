 ISLAMABAD, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan said on Thursday that evidence supplied by India failed to strengthen a case for the arrest of Hafiz Saeed, founder of a Pakistani militant group blamed for the attacks on Mumbai in November last year. Foreign Office spokesman Abdul Basit will almost certainly fuel Indian concerns that Pakistan is dragging its feet over the prosecution of militants New Delhi says planned the attacks that killed 166 people between Nov. 26-29. Indian officials, having handed over a fresh dossier last Saturday, have insisted that Pakistan has enough evidence to successfully prosecute leaders of the Lashkar-e-Taiba militant group, including Saeed. Basit said Pakistan was proceeding with case but the information provided by India had not helped. "The material contained in that ... dossier apropos Hafiz Saeed is not really enough and doesn't really strengthen our hands to take, or to proceed legally, as has been expected," he told a weekly news conference. Saeed was detained in the wake of the Mumbai attacks after a U.N. Security Council resolution put him on a list of people and organisations supporting al Qaeda. But in June, the Lahore High Court released him on grounds of insufficient evidence, prompting the Pakistan government to lodge an appeal with the Supreme Court for his re-arrest. The Supreme Court adjourned a hearing this week without fixing any new date and Saeed's lawyer said it had been put off as the government's prosecutor was not prepared. Saeed quit Lashkar in the days following an attack on the Indian parliament in December 2001, that forced Pakistan to ban the group, but he stayed on as head of a charity that has been placed on both U.N. and U.S. terrorist lists and is said to be a front for Lashkar. Pakistan has also begun proceedings against five militants for their alleged role in the Mumbai plot but charges have still to be read and the next hearing has been put off until Aug. 29. Pakistan has also launched a global search for 13 other suspects in the Mumbai attack, the international police network Interpol said on Thursday. But court delays, and demands for better evidence will do little to allay Indian suspicions that Saeed and Lashkar are regarded as assets by Pakistani intelligence which, according to analysts, has used the jihadi group in the past to fight Indian rule in Kashmir. The nuclear-armed neighbours agreed last month to restart dialogue, but India stopped short of resuming a peace process that was put on hold after tensions flared following Mumbai. India wants to see Pakistan punish those responsible and dismantle "the infrastructure of terrorism" on Pakistani soil. Pakistani officials have told diplomats privately that they cannot risk a major crackdown on militant groups like Lashkar, based in the central province of Punjab, as the army has its hands full fighting a Taliban insurgency in the northwest. A court in Mumbai on Thursday sentenced three Indians to death for conspiring with Lashkar in an earlier attack on the city that killed 54 people.
