 Dhaka, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan said his team is focused on getting the game plan right when they meet Zimbabwe in the first ODI of the five-match Grameenphone Cup series at Bulawayo's Queens Sports Club on Sunday. The Tigers are coming off a remarkable historic Test and ODI sweep over the West Indies but faltered in the only warm-up game against Zimbabwe A on Friday but the skipper was confident of a turnaround. "It was a long journey from the West Indies. We were flying for nearly two days. Obviously there was a bit fatigue when we took the field against Zimbabwe A. Our kits also arrived at the last moment. However, everything is settled now and we are looking forward to carrying on the good work from the West Indies and we want to play our game," Shakib was quoted as saying on TigerCricket.com, the official website of the Bangladesh Cricket Board. Bangladesh lost the warm-up game by seven wickets after mustering only 180 but the world's number one one-day all-rounder indicated that the team for the first game was likely to remain the same which means Nazmul Hossain and Syed Rasel will be the two seamers while Shakib, Enamul Haque Jr, Mahmudullah Riyad and Naeem Islam are the spin options. "The wicket looks okay. It has a slight shade of grass but it is compact. However, we'll have another look tomorrow morning before deciding on the final eleven." Shakib said the team was not under any pressure to play Zimbabwe in their backyard after a memorable time in the Caribbean. "We are professional players and Zimbabwe offers a challenge which we have to face in a professional way. We will try to do our best and execute our plans. We are not under any pressure." The match starts at 2:30pm Bangladesh Standard Time. TEN Sports and Bangladesh Television are going to telecast the game live.
