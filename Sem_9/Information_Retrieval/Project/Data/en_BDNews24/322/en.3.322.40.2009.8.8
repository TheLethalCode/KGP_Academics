 Dhaka, August 8 (bdnews24.com)  A four-year-old girl was killed and another six people, including the girl's seven-year-old brother, were grievously injured when a 'drug addict' went on a rampage with a sharp weapon in the capital's Sutrapur area on Saturday, said police. Sub-inspector of Sutrapur police station, Ashikur Rahman, told bdnews24.com that Faruq Miah, 28, left his home at around 4pm, obtained "a sharp weapon from somewhere" and launched a frenzied attack, "hacking victims at random" at Murgitola Distillery Road. The dead child was identified as Mahia Hossain, who was pronounced dead after being taken into Dhaka Medical College Hospital. "Faruq chopped successively at her head and neck," said Rahman. "Her brother, Emon, was also injured on his head and neck in the attack." He said Faruq also attacked tea-stall owner Abdul Hamid, 45, hotel employee Nazrul Islam, 26, Aleya Begam, 26, her husband Osman Ghoni, 35, and tailor Abdur Rahim, 45. Father of the murdered child, Rahat Hossain, told bdnews24.com his son and daughter went out to buy some chocolates. "I got the news of the attack and rushed out from home. I found Mahia on the ground." Doctors declared her dead at the hospital, said Rahat. All the injured were admitted into DMCH, where Emon is in critical condition, said sub-inspector Rahman. He said some of the injured were stabbed as they tried to stop Faruq. "Locals eventually pinned him down, gave him a mass-beating and handed him over to the police," said Rahman. Faruq's father Ansar Miah, of Murgitola, said his son was a drug addict. "He was in the house one moment. Suddenly he went out and did this terrible thing," said Ansar. The father said the weapon was not from their home. bdnews2
