 SYDNEY, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The number of people missing from the Tonga ferry disaster has risen to 85, Australia's Defense Ministry said on Saturday. The cause of Wednesday's sinking, 86 km (53 miles) northeast of the Pacific island's capital, Nuku'alofa, is not yet known. It was first reported that 79 people were on the ship, but the number was revised up by Tongan authorities. The ferry had been traveling from Nuku'alofa to Ha'afeva, in the Nomuka Islands group. Detailing the current figures of missing or dead, the ministry said 85 of 141 people on board the vessel were unaccounted for. A Tongan patrol boat earlier recovered two bodies and 54 survivors, including 28 crew members, it said.
