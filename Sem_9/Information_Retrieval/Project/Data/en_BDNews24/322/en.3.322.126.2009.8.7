 COLOMBO, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fast bowler Umar Gul will miss the remaining two games of Pakistan's one-day series against Sri Lanka due to an ankle injury. Gul will also miss their Twenty20 match next Wednesday. Pakistan all-rounder Abdul Razzaq is also injured with a side strain although team sources told Reuters he could recover in time for the final ODI Sunday. Sri Lanka fast bowler Dilhara Fernando picked up a shoulder injury while fielding in the third one-day international and has been replaced in the squad by Dammika Prasad.
