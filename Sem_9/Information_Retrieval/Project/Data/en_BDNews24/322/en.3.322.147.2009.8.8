 Dhaka, Aug 7 (bdnews24.com)--Dhaka City Corporation has allegedly evicted National Bank Limited and Pragati Insurance installations in the city's Panthapath in violation of High Court orders. The allegations surfaced over the 2.67-acre land (no. 1576) beside Sundarman Hotel, one decimal of which costs Tk 3 three crore. National Bank law officer Apurba Kumar Kar said NBL and Pragati bought the land from Islam Group and Jupiter Groups in 1976, with the owning 1.25 acre and Pragati Insurance the rest. In May, the DCCserved a notice on them saying that the two organisations had been in illegal possession of the land that it owned , he said. "We later filed a writ petition with the High Court and the High Court stayed the notice for two weeks and then six months. But, the DCC ordered the installations to be razed to the ground and local Awami League men had been abetting them in the drive, the law officer alleged. He said they filed a case with Dhaka assistant judges' court against the DCC, which in turn imposed a ban upon the dismantling of the installations and evictions. DCC sub-assistant engineer Ariful Islam said NBL and Pragati owned land no. 1576 and DCC land no. 1630. But they encroached on the DCC land when they erected their installations, he said. Islam said the DCC repeatedly asked them to free the land, but to no avail, prompting it to dismantle the illegal installations on Thursday. bd
