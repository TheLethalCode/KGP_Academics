 Khagrachhari, Aug 8 (bdnews24.com)  Two more army camps were dismantled in Khagrachhari district Saturday as part of the government's move to withdraw a full brigade from the Chittagong Hill Tracts, the largest single pullout of troops in the region, a top district official said. The Dadanchhari army camp, at Moghaichhari in Laxmichhari Upazila, and Dashbil army camp, in Manikchhari Upazila, under Guimara Brigade were withdrawn, deputy commissioner Mohammad Abdullah told bdnews24.com. The camps accounted for 80 army personnel, including Ansar members, who were brought back to the army brigade's headquarters in Matiranga Upazila, he said. Chhanpila army camp in Panchhari Upazila might also be withdrawn by Saturday or early Sunday, he said. The pullout process of the Guimara Brigade started on Friday, with dismantling of the army camp at Mohalchhari Union in Manikchhari Upazila. The government announced the pullout of one complete brigade, from the total five brigades deployed in the hill districts, on July 29, to resume implementation of the 1997 CHT Peace Accord. The withdrawal of the Guimara Brigade involves dismantling of 35 army camps scattered through the three CHT districts. Of these, 13 were in Khagrachhari district. Abdullah said the rest of the camps will be withdrawn in phases over the coming month. bdn
