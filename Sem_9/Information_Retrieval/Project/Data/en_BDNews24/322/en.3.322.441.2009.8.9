<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 09 (bdnews24.com)The government is considering issuing bonds exclusively for renewable energy projects as part of a comprehensive plan to stimulate the sector. Agriculture minister Motia Chowdhury, addressing a roundtable on renewable energy concerns on Sunday, said the government was launching a host of initiatives to promote green technologies and bring affordable energy within reach of the poor. She said the government was now considering floating bonds to create a separate fund dedicated to renewable energy projects. "The government has given top-priority to the country's energy needs," said Motia. She said green technologies were being explored to assist farmers, and the agriculture minister had recently called on scientists and other stakeholders to focus on solar power to operate irrigation water-pumps. "This will save a huge amount of money," said Motia. Only 40 percent of the country's 160 million people was connected to the national grid, said Motia, who added that only six percent of the population had access to natural gas supplies. "In fact, 70 percent of Bangladesh's total energy is provided by biomass," she said, referring to rural households' use of cow dung as a fuel. Also attending the meeting, adviser to the prime minister Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury said alternative energy sources for irrigation was now high on the government's agenda. "The government is planning to establish Solar Home Systems in community hospitals located in off-grid areas," said Tawfiq-e-Elahi. Solar Home Systems have proliferated in off-grid areas in rural Bangladesh since 2003. "There are also many possibilities for harnessing biogas, and geo-thermal projects in the northern part of the country are an option too," he said. Chowdhury said a Sustainable Energy Development Agency (SEDA) is being set up to promote renewable agency sources in the country. Dipal C Barua, alternate chairman of Bangladesh Renewable Energy Society (BRES), said in his key-note presentation that more than 350,000 Solar Home Systems have been established across the country, benefiting around 30 million rural people. "We have also constructed around 28,000 biogas plants, under a Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (BCSIR) and LGED initiative, from 1996 to 2004," said Barua. He said the government had set a target of meeting 10 percent of the country's energy needs through renewable energy technologies by 2020. All VAT and taxes have been removed from solar panels, and the Bangladesh Bank has created a special fund of Tk 200 crore to build effluent treatment plants and other renewable energy technologies," said Dipal. The meeting was also attended by BRES chairman Muhammad Zamir, the South Korean ambassador Suk Bum Park, Charge D' Affairs of the German embassy Rolf Deiter Rein Heard and Rahimafrooz Renewable Energy Ltd's chairman Niaz Rahim. The discussion was titled, 'Renewable Energy: Implementation of National Renewable Energy Policy', organised by the Bangladesh Renewable Energy Society (BRES), at the at the Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies auditorium
