 Pabna, Aug 07 (bdnews24.com)Underground operatives vandalised, looted at least 20 houses and set those on fire on Friday morning at Kakilakhali in Ataikula Upazila in Pabna in an apparent reprisal for the last month's killing of two extremists, police said. Abdus Sattar and Abdur Razzak were killed on July 30 in a bomb attack by their rival group, officer in charge of Ataikula Police Station Sirajul Islam told bdnews24.com. A gang of 25-30 members of 'Amod Bahini' swooped on the village at 1am, he said and added that police had been sent to the scene. "We are looking into the incident," superintendent of police Nibash Chandra Majhi said. Villagers preferring not to be named said four armed motorcycle-riding police men had entered the village at noon and gone back in a hurry after talking with some people. bdn
