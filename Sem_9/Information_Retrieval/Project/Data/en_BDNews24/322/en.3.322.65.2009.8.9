<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com)Commerce minister Faruk Khan has asked customs officials to quickly release imported essential commodities from the port to help the government keep the prices under control in Ramadan . He asked customs officers and other incumbents to act on an emergency basis so that duty-free goods are not left at the port for duty-related problems before Ramadan. At a meeting with customs officers and representatives of related organisations at the Shulko Bhaban in Chittagong on Sunday, he also asked for quick resolution of petty problems including procrastination in testing the quality and taxation of the products. "Lots of consumer products have flowed in for Ramadan in the last two months and those are stocked up in the storages. The government is careful about it," he said, advising the consumers not to panic over shortage. The minister said the government will work in coordination with the businessmen and told businessmen to not spike the prices unfairly. A process was ongoing to reduce the time for registration with joint stock companies to eight hours and an online system has been launched, he added. "Earlier, it took 90 days to register in a joint stock company. The government has reduced the time to three days." Khan said the customs department earned a bad name because some of its officers prefer to lead a lavish life, alluding to their corruption and urged them to shed the tag. He told officials to introduce automation in the Shulko Bhaban. "It is beyond me why the automation is yet to fully function in spite of talented officers working at the customs department." "It is not right to think that the government will always do right. Though the government has made some mistakes in the last six months it has corrected those," he said. About the crises of skilled manpower and equipment at privately owned Inland Container Depot, he said his ministry will soon sit with the representatives of ICD and assist them, if needed. Earlier, the minister inspected the Chittagong TCB office in the morning and attended a meeting with the representatives of different organisations using the port. He attended another meeting with the big importers based in Khatunganj and Chaktai at the Circuit House in the afternoon. bd
