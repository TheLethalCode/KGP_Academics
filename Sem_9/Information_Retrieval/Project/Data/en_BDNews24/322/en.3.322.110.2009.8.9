<TITLE> HC moved to halt CHT troops pullout </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com)--Two petitions have been filed seeking a High Court ban on the ongoing largest single pullout of army from the Chittagong Hill Tracts since a peace accord was signed in 1997. The petitioners argued that the troops withdrawal will put under threat the lives of Bangali settlers living in the hills region dominated by indigenous people. Jamaat leader barrister Abdur Razzak moved the petitions for Tajul Islam and Badiuzzaman with the bench of justices Syed Refaat Ahmed and Moinul Islam. The court was also told that it had issued a rule, following a previous petition filed by Badiuzzaman in 2000, asking the government to explain why the CHT peace accord should not be declared illegal. The army withdrawal will make the previous petition ineffective. Islam had also filed another writ petition in 2007 challenging the legitimacy of the CHT peace accord and its implementation. The court had issued a rule on that on Aug 27. The petition is now in the court's business agenda, but the withdrawal from the CHT would make it ineffective. Petitioner Islam said bdnews24.com, "Army withdrawal will encourage Chakma dominance over the region. It will make our (previous) writ petitions ineffective. So we filed further petitions today against the army withdrawal." The court is set to hear the peitions on Aug 16. The government on Friday started what it says "the biggest withdrawal" of army from CHT in line with an announcement on July 29 of withdrawal of one complete brigade, from the total five brigades deployed in the hill districts. The withdrawal, part of the process to resume implementation of the peace accord, would be complete by the end of the next month. Four camps under Khagrachharhi and Guimara regions have been withdrawn. There are five brigades and five camps in the three CHT districts of Rangamatai, Khagrachharhi and Bandarban. Jamaat's key ally BNP has claimed that the withdrawal of army camps will destabilise the hills region. Former BNP law minister Moudud Ahmed said last week that the partial army withdrawal was designed to clear "non-indigenous residents" from the area. bdnew
