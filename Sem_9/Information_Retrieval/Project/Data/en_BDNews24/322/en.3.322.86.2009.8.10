 COLOMBO, Aug 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan clinched a second consolation victory in the fifth and final one-day international against Sri Lanka on Sunday but the hosts still won the series 3-2. Pakistan, who lost the first three games of the series in Dambulla, won by 132 runs after scoring an impressive 279 for eight, skipper Younus Khan leading from the front with 76 and Misbah-ul-Haq supporting with an undefeated 73.

Earlier, Khan anchored Pakistan's innings with a 100-ball knock that included five boundaries and was supported by Misbah-ul-Haq, who scored an unbeaten 73 from 82 balls with five boundaries.

Middle order batsman Mohammad Yousuf chipped in with 43 off 55 balls. Paceman Nuwan Kulasekara was Sri Lanka's best bowler, finishing with three for 46 from his 10 o
