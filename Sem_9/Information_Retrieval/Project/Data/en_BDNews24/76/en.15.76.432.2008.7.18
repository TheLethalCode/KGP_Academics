 Dhaka, July 18 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate court ordered businessman, Sayeed Hossain Chowdhury, to jail on Friday. The founding chairman and CEO of HRC Group was arrested for 'violating emergency powers rules' through his alleged money laundering activities. Gulshan police officer-in-charge Obaidul Huq told bdnews24.com: "Sayeed Hossain Chowdhury was arrested from his house in Gulshan in the morning on charges of violating emergency powers rules." A general diary filed with Gulshan police said information provided by intelligence agencies revealed that Sayeed Hossain was involved in money laundering, which was destroying the country's economy. Gulshan police sub-inspector Md Shahidullah filed the GD, in which Sayeed was accused of listing assets in others' names. He was produced before the court in the afternoon, where chief metropolitan magistrate AM Zulfikar Hayat ordered him to jail. A plea for bail was kept on record, but the magistrate said it was beyond his jurisdiction to hear or rule on any request for bail. The bail petition pointed out that Sayeed Hossain was the CEO and chairman of HRC Group Ltd, and his arrest would affect thousands of employees of the 18 sister concerns of the company. Sayeed's lawyers denied their client was involved in money laundering. Sayeed Hossain, elder brother of Awami League leader Saber Hossain Chowdhury, is also the chairman of the Jai Jai Din editorial board, a major shareholder of English-language daily The New Age, and a director of One Bank. bdnews2
