 Dhaka, July 19 (bdnews24.com)  The Sonali Otit Club financially supported by footballer Manwar Hossain Nannu's family will award two best referees of the upcoming B. League. The prize would be named 'Manwar Hossain Nannu Football Referee Award', Sonali Otit Club general secretary Mosabber Hossain told a press conference at the club premises Saturday. Nannu was a prominent footballer from the mid- 70s to early 80s and died of cancer last February at the age of 60. The two referees would get Tk 25,000 each and a trophy every year, he said adding that the club would appoint a panel of judges to select the best referees. Shahana Hossain, wife of Nannu, said that they had taken this initiative to keep the memory of Nannu alive. Shamsul Alam Manju, younger brother of Nannu, said referees are always being ignored from their deserved rewards and their effort would inspire others to do the needful. Badal Roy, vice president of the Bangladesh Football Federation, said that the effort to award the referees was a different move and it would help the referees contribute their best. Former national footballer Golam Sarwar Tipu and Nannu's son Sunny were also among others present.
