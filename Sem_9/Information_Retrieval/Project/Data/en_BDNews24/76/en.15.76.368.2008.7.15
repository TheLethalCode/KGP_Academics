 Dhaka, July 15 (bdnews24.com)  The former Bangladesh national cricketers are likely to play a twenty20 'festival match' against former Pakistani cricketers during the four-nation Twenty20 tournament in Canada, said Faruque Ahmed Tuesday. The four-nation Twenty20 tournament involving Bangladesh, Pakistan, the West Indies and hosts Canada, organised by Pakistan-based event management organisation Sports International Marketing (SIM), is scheduled for August 14-17. "The match may take place at a suitable time before or after the tournament and as far as I know the match will be called festival match," former national skipper Faruque Ahmed, who was given the responsibility to form a team, told bdnews24.com. Ahmed said they were thinking of picking those cricketers, not considered for the national fold this time. Athar Ali Khan, Aminul Islam Bulbul, Khaled Mashud Pilot, Mohammad Rafique, Tushar Imran, Mohammad Sharif would play for the Bangladesh side, said Ahmed, who served a four-year period as a chief selector. He added that the Pakistani counterparts might include Wasim Akram and Waqar Younus. bdne
