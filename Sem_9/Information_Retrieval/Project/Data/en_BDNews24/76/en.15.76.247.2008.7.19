 Dhaka, July 19 (bdnews24.com)Acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman Saturday vowed to resist any polls under emergency rule. At a hunger strike programme at AL chief Sheikh Hasina's political office in Dhanmondi, Zillur also made a warning against any other polls ahead of national elections. "We will not allow any polls amid the state of emergency. We will not take part in any polls ahead of the national elections. Nor will we let anybody join the polls either," he said. Awami League leaders and workers observed a hunger strike across the country from 11.00am to 4.00pm, demanding permanent freedom for party president Sheikh Hasina, a food rationing system and measures to rein in the soaring prices of daily essentials. AL presidium member Amir Hossain Amu said the hunger strike was meant to express solidarity with people across the country and protest the price hike. Amu demanded the prices of essentials be brought within the reach of purchasing power of people. He said the AL would launch further protests if the government failed to bring down essential prices. Tofail Ahmed, another presidium member, alleged that the government did not keep the promises made during the dialogue with the party. "The dialogue has become a farce." bdnews
