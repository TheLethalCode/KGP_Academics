<TITLE> Obama in Iraq's Anbar, former insurgent haven </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BAGHDAD, Tue Jul 22, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama travelled to Iraq's Anbar province on Tuesday to meet Sunni Arab tribal leaders whose decision to fight al Qaeda helped change the course of the conflict in the country. Two Iraqi officials said Obama met tribal chiefs including Ahmed Abu Risha, head of the US-backed Awakening Council, an alliance of Sunni Arab tribes. A US official confirmed Obama was in Anbar but gave no details. Obama, visiting Iraq as part of a US congressional delegation, met Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and American military commanders on Monday in a trip dominated so far by the question of when US troops should leave Iraq. US strategy in Iraq and troop numbers are key issues in the election race between the first-term senator from Illinois and Republican candidate John McCain. Jamal al-Mashhadani, spokesman for the Anbar governorate, said Obama met Abu Risha as well as the governor of the province and other tribal leaders in the provincial capital Ramadi. He gave no further details. Anbar, a vast desert region to the west of Baghdad, was once the heartland of the Sunni Arab insurgency against U.S. forces and Shi'ite-led governments in Baghdad. In late 2006, tribal leaders sick of al Qaeda's indiscriminate killing of civilians and austere version of Islam joined with the U.S. military to largely expel the group. Violence fell sharply and that model for cooperation was used in Baghdad and other parts of Iraq. Since then, al Qaeda has been increasingly squeezed into Iraq's northern provinces. Maliki told Obama and the other lawmakers on Monday he hoped U.S. combat troops could be out of Iraq in 2010, a goal not far apart from Obama's own promise to withdraw combat troops within 16 months of taking office, should he win the November election. With violence at its lowest level since early 2004, Iraqi officials have spoken with growing confidence about timetables and timeframes for U.S. combat forces to leave. "Iraqis want an aspirational timeline, with a clear date, for the redeployment of American combat forces," said a statement from Obama and the lawmakers travelling with him. "(Maliki) stated his hope that U.S. combat forces could be out of Iraq in 2010." TROOP LEVELS IN SPOTLIGHT McCain himself appeared to leave the door open on Monday to a large-scale drawdown of U.S. troops in the next two years if conditions on the ground were suitable, saying success had made it possible for troops to return home. His spokesman, Tucker Bounds, said the senator's comments did not reflect a shift in position. McCain has long argued against setting a timetable for a U.S. troop withdrawal. Some Iraqis believe their security forces are not ready and that a premature removal of the 147,000 U.S. troops in Iraq could tip the country back into widespread violence. Maliki and US President George W Bush agreed last week to set a "time horizon" for reducing US forces in Iraq. It was the closest Washington has come to acknowledging the need for a withdrawal timeframe. Obama's Iraq trip has been cloaked in secrecy for security reasons but he is expected to leave on Tuesday. He plans also to travel to Jordan, Israel, France, Germany and Britain. He has criticised McCain and Bush for making Iraq the centre of the battle against terrorism and said he would pursue a new national security strategy to rebuild foreign alliances and regain global goodwill destroyed by the war. Obama made his opposition to the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 a centrepiece of his election campaign. McCain has accused Obama of failing to acknowledge the security gains in Iraq from a US troop "surge" that Bush ordered in early 2007. Bush deployed 30,000 extra soldiers to try to drag Iraq back from all-out sectarian war. The last of those reinforcements left Iraq on the weekend
