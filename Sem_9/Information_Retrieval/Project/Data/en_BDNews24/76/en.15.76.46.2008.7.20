 Dhaka, July 20 (bdnews24.com)  World Bank has pledged a first phase donation of $100 million to assist Bangladesh in implementing the current fiscal budget, a WB official said Sunday. This first phase assistance will be provided for the government's food security programmes for the 2008-09 fiscal year, the new World Bank vice president for South Asia, Isabel Guerrero, told reporters after a meeting with finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam at the Planning Ministry. The WB official said that her organisation would continue its assistance in ensuring food security, as well as extending assistance in tackling the effects of climate change. The donor agency might end up doubling its assistance in the current fiscal year, she added. Guerrero said that the country was currently facing three major challenges: climate change, impact of worldwide inflation and food security. The WB would provide assistance to Bangladesh in all three areas, she said. Finance adviser Mirza Aziz said: "The WB has ensured assistance in the food security sector to reduce budget deficit." "The development organisation also assured its assistance in tackling the losses due to climate change," he added. The WB vice president also mentioned an international conference titled Focus Bangladesh, to be held in London on Sept 10. The conference will discuss ways to extend assistance to Bangladesh in facing climate change, including an emphasis on food security. Guerrero arrived in Bangladesh Saturday night after replacing Praful C Patel in the post of WB vice president for the South Asia region. This was her first visit to Bangladesh. Donors recently pledged a total $340 million for food security programmes, with the Asian Development Bank committing half the amount. "The World Bank, ADB and other donors will provide Bangladesh with food security assistance worth 340 million dollars, of which the ADB slice will amount to 170 million," outgoing ADB resident representative Hua Du announced on July 14 ahead of her departure from Dhaka. bdnews24.
