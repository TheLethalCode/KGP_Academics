 Dhaka, July 20 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh has chosen golf and wrestling as their two 'host quota' disciplines for the South Asian Games, scheduled for December 2009. The decision was made Sunday at an executive committee meeting of the Bangladesh Olympic Association at Kurmitola Golf Club, with BOA president Gen Moeen U Ahmed chairing. The member countries of the South Asian Games, at a meeting in Dhaka last February, finalised 15 disciplines and asked the hosts to choose two more for a total of 17 separate disciplines. Athletic, swimming, boxing, football, weightlifting, shooting, taekwondo, karate, ushu, handball, archery, table tennis, kabaddi, hockey and squash were originally selected last February. BOA secretary general Kutubuddin Ahmed said in a statement that he had urged Sunday's meeting to consider further disciplines such as judo, basketball, volleyball and badminton so that national athletes in these sports would get more exposure. The meeting also approved a final 13-member Bangladesh contingent for the Beijing Olympic Games, comprised of six athletes, three coach-cum-managers, a general team manager, a chef de mission, and two representatives from youth camp. The special assistant to the chief adviser for sports, the BOA president and BOA secretary general will also go to Beijing as invited guests of the hosts. The BOA president hoped that, even though Bangladesh was making a 'token appearance' at the upcoming Beijing Olympics, the number of athletes from Bangladesh would increase in future Olympic Games. bd
