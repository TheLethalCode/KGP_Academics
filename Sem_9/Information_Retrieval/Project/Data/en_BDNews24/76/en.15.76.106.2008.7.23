 Chapainawabganj, July 23 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Rifles and India's Border Security Force exchanged several rounds of gunfire at the Chakpara border in Chapainawabganj Wednesday, resulting in a shutdown of Sona Masjid Land Port, officials said. The firing occurred for about 45 minutes in the border area, from around 6.15am to 7am, Chapainawabganj 39 Battalion operation officer Maj Syed Abu Hassan told bdnews24.com. The BDR official refused to disclose whether there were any casualties. Belal Hossain, a deputy director of private company Panama Port Link Ltd, said that BDR had asked them to close their export-import activities at the Sona Masjid Land Port until the situation became normal. "We have stopped our operations at the land port since morning," Belal said. A BDR official, preferring not to be named, said BSF members had allegedly entered Bangladesh territory to capture a smuggler and BDR aimed fire at them. BSF returned fire, the official said. bdnews24.co
