 Dhaka, July 16 (bdnews24.com)  An ad-hoc executive committee of the Bangladesh Cricket Board Thursday approved a budget of Tk 130.6 crore for fiscal 2008-09 with a huge deficit of over Tk 57 crore. The meeting approved the expenditure budget of Tk 1,306,721,349 and projected revenue at Tk 733,850,000, a deficit of Tk 57, 28, 71,349. To explain the difference between expenditure and revenue, BCB media committee chairman Ahmed Sajjadul Alam Bobby told bdnews24.com that the inclusion of the women's cricket expenditure and widening the field of the Cricket Committee of Dhaka Metropolis had raised the budget amount. Bobby, however, said that they would try to cut the amount from each large sector and increase the income through finding out new sectors. The organiser said that the budget had calculated a minimum amount for the upcoming series at home that might increase during the series. Bobby felt that the budget was a realistic one, finalised after having been discussed several times with the finance committee with the first outlined budget being Tk 135 crore. In the budget, the highest allocation of approximately Tk 25 crore was kept for the cricket operation while game development would get Tk 17.41 crore. The third highest allocation of Tk 8.49 crore was given to the grounds and facilities while Tk 9.56 crore was sanctioned for the logistics committee.
