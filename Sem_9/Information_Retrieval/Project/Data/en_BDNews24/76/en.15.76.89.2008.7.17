<TITLE> Flintoff to bat at seven in second test </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LEEDS, England, July 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Andrew Flintoff will bat at number seven in his first test match for 18 months when England face South Africa at Headingley in the second test on Friday. Captain Michael Vaughan told a news conference on Thursday that Paul Collingwood would make way for Flintoff with wicketkeeper Tim Ambrose, whose recent international form has been poor, promoted to number six. Opening bowler Ryan Sidebottom, who was afflicted by a side strain in the first test at Lord's which ended in a draw on Monday, will undergo a fitness test on Friday. Chris Tremlett has been recalled to the squad as cover and Nottinghamshire pace bowler Darren Pattinson has been placed on standby for James Anderson who is also suffering from a sore back. Vaughan said he always considered Flintoff was a number seven, even though he enjoyed a successful series at number six in England's 2005 Ashes triumph. "His style of play is attacking and given the chance he can take the game away from an opposition," Vaughan said. "He's happy there and feels comfortable and hopefully it will take some pressure off him and allow him to express himself. "I'm very confident Tim Ambrose can go up and score runs. That is the confidence boost you need sometimes, he is hitting the ball well. "He has only had one innings in this series. He didn't have a great one-day series (against New Zealand), which is why people are talking about him." Flintoff, 30, last played a test in Australia in January last year and his return to the side after a fourth ankle operation was delayed by a side strain. PROUD CAPTAIN Vaughan said he was proud to be playing his 50th test as captain. "It's a huge honour," Vaughan said. "You only get to that achievement by having good players, good management and winning games of cricket. You can only win games of cricket with good players and I'm just the lucky one to have had a few." South Africa are assessing the fitness of opener Neil McKenzie, who sustained a groin strain while scoring a second innings century in the first test. Captain Graeme Smith said his opening partner was making good progress but would be given until the last moment to prove himself. Smith was also not surprised to learn that his friend and adversary Flintoff had returned to the England team. "We prepared with Fred being in our plans from the start," Smith said. "We expected them to bring him back, obviously they took a slightly more cautious route with his planning. "Personally I have a lot of respect for Fred with what he has achieved and for the type of man he is, we have got on well and I am sure he is going to be a big influence on the England team." Teams (probable): England - Andrew Strauss, Alastair Cook, Michael Vaughan (captain), Kevin Pietersen, Ian Bell, Tim Ambrose, Andrew Flintoff, Stuart Broad, Ryan Sidebottom, Monty Panesar, James Anderson. South Africa - Graeme Smith (captain), Neil McKenzie, Hashim Amla, Jacques Kallis, Ashwell Prince, AB de Villiers, Mark Boucher, Paul Harris, Morne Morkel, Dale Steyn, Makhaya Ntin
