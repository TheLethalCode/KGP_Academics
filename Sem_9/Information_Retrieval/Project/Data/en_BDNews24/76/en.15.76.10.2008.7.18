 Dhaka, July 18 (bdnews24.com)The foreign secretary-level talks between Bangladesh and India ended Friday in New Delhi with both sides expressing satisfaction over its outcome, and Indian transit taking a back seat, the foreign adviser said. Dhaka and Delhi agreed to boost cooperation in fighting terrorism and curbing the smuggling of arms, drugs and fake currencies, according to reports from the Indian capital. The controversial issue of Indian transit did not get much weight, Iftekhar said. He refused to comment on whether border incidents resulting in deaths, such as occurred earlier Friday, was discussed. Bangladesh foreign secretary Md Touhid Hossain, before departing for Delhi to meet his Indian counterpart, said on Wednesday that the deaths of Bangladesh Rifles personnel by India's Border Security Force in 'border skirmishes' would be one of the issues at the talks. When asked whether Friday's border incidentin which two BDR men were shot dead by BSF with at least one reported BSF casualtyhad affected the outcome of the talks in New Delhi, the foreign adviser said: "It would not be appropriate to comment at this time." "We are all happy about the outcome of the foreign office consultation," Iftekhar told bdnews24.com Friday night. "I have had talks with the foreign secretary and the high commissioner in Delhi. They briefed me about their discussions with the Indian side," he said. Bangladesh at the talks requested India to reach an agreement on sharing of waters of the common rivers, especially of the Teesta, in the water-scarce northern part of the country, according to a previous statement issued by the Bangladesh High Commission in Delhi. But the two sides ended up agreeing only to the convening of the relevant technical committees to carry on the work in this regard, said the statement. Touhid Hossain on Thursday also requested greater access of Bangladeshi exports to India and for measures to reduce the $1.9 billion trade gap, the Bangladesh High Commission said in an official statement on the talks. Touhid requested his Indian counterpart to expedite the export of the remainder of 5 lakh tonnes of rice to Bangladesh, and also to consider complete withdrawal of restrictions on rice export by India. The foreign secretary level meeting lauded the launch of the the Maitree Express, the long-awaited DhakaKolkata direct passenger train link, and appreciated the need for reducing the waiting time of passengers at both borders, the High Commission said. Touhid Hossain invited his Indian counterpart to visit Bangladesh for the next foreign office consultation at a convenient time. The Bangladesh-India Foreign Office Consultation takes place every year to review issues of mutual interest. Last year's such meeting took place in Dhaka. bdn
