 BANGALORE, Tue Jul 15, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian shares fell 4.9 percent on Tuesday to their lowest close in 15 months, joining a world equities rout as investors dumped financials on concerns about the fallout from a worsening global credit turmoil. ICICI Bank, India's No. 2 lender, was knocked down 8.7 percent to 529.30 rupees, its lowest close since July 2006, and mortgage lender Housing Development and Finance Corp dropped 6.9 percent to 1,800.30 rupees. The banking sector index ended down 7.8 percent. Although Indian banks have no direct exposure to the US subprime mortgage sector, the global financial sector turmoil impacts sentiment in the local market and raises worries of more withdrawals by foreign funds. Arun Kejriwal, strategist at research firm KRIS, said the worries were overdone. "Where is the large-scale loan default in the domestic market that can affect the Indian banking sector? It's only sentiment, there's no logic behind this kind of a sell-off in bank stocks," he said. Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd fell 14 percent to 409.25 rupees, extending its losses of 10.5 percent on Monday, on concerns a U.S. probe on allegations it introduced adulterated drugs may hit its sales in the United States. Ranbaxy, India's top drug maker by sales, has strongly denied the allegations in the motion and said no legal proceedings in the sense of a prosecution had been started. The main 30-share BSE index dropped 4.91 percent, or 654.32 points, to 12,676.19, its lowest close since April 3, 2007. It opened down 2 percent and then fell as much as 5.4 percent during trade. All the index's components ended in the negative zone. In the broader market, losers led gainers four-to-one on volume of 238 million shares. "I don't see any positive trigger that can dilute the flow of negative news," said K.K. Mital, head of portfolio management services at Globe Capital in New Delhi. "More downside certainly can't be ruled out." Fitch Ratings lowered India's domestic rating outlook to negative from stable on Tuesday, citing the central government's worsening fiscal position. Foreign funds have pulled out nearly $7 billion in 2008, pushing the BSE index down 37.5 percent and making it one of Asia's worst performers. In 2007, they had moved in $17.4 billion and helped the index rally 47 percent to record highs. Top lender State Bank of India shed 6.4 percent to 1,177.80 rupees and HDFC Bank tumbled 11.3 percent to 916.40 rupees, tracking the weakness in the Asian and European financials. High oil prices, which rose over $146 a barrel on Tuesday, remained a concern for India that imports a bulk of its energy requirements, Kejriwal said. Annual inflation was at nearly 12 percent in late June, the highest in more than 13 years, mainly due to high oil prices, and analysts expect the central bank would again tighten monetary policy to curb price rises. Traders said political factors also weighed on the market with the government set to face a trust vote in parliament next week, following the withdrawal of its left allies last week in protest against a civilian nuclear with the United States. The 50-share NSE index or Nifty fell 4.42 percent at 3,861.10 points. Elsewhere in the region, the Karachi's 100-share index fell 1.95 percent to 10,959.87, while Colombo's All share index edged down 0.19 percent at 2,440.15 points. STOCKS THAT MOVED SpiceJet rose 2.2 percent to 28.55 rupees, having risen as much as 16 percent in early deals, after the budget carrier said US-based WL Ross & Co would invest 3.45 billion rupees ($80 million) in the company. GEE Ltd gained nearly 10 percent to 53.05 rupees, after the electrode welding maker said its board would meet on July 20 to consider a bonus share issue.
