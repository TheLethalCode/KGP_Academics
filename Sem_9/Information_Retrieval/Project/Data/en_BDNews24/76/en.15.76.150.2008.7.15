 Dhaka, July 15 (bdnews24.com)  Adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman has again made positive sounds about the release of detained former prime minister Khaleda Zia. "We are pressing forward with patience. The matter of of Khaleda Zia's release is currently facing legal procedures," the adviser told reporters at the Secretariat on Tuesday. "We hope to see a positive result very soon," he said. On the seeming delay over releasing the BNP chairperson, Zillur said: "The government in a gazette regarding the release of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina mentioned that it would release Khaleda Zia on the same grounds as it did Hasina." Asked whether the government had any plans to send Khaleda abroad for medical treatment, he said: "The government does not make any plans to send anybody abroad for treatment. It is one's personal matter where one will go to seek treatment." The adviser reiterated that the government had invited BNP to dialogue and he hoped that the party would join in time. bdnew
