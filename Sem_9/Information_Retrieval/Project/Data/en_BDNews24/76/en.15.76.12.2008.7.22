 Dhaka, July 22 (bdnews24.com)--The Securities and Exchange Commission Tuesday finalised its decision to bar mutual funds from issuing bonus or right shares. "The SEC board in Tuesday's meeting approved the decision," SEC executive director Farhad Ahmed told reporters in his office. The capital market regulator revealed their plan from a Jun 26 press briefing to ban MFs from issuing bonus shares. The SEC official had said they would seek public opinions for the decision through a media announcement. The news of restrictions angered retail investors, followed by demonstrations by them and a slump in the prices of MFs. Consequently the market slipped into the red due to sell-offs as investor confidence on the market went down. Asked whether the SEC felt any pressure in the wake of falling indices and investors' agitation, Farhad said: "Not so." "We are just working to keep the market on track." According to a new decision, brokerage firms will have to seek approval from the SEC instead of stock exchanges to open branches. "From now, the SEC will approve it. Brokerage houses having paid-up capital of Tk 75 lakh will be permitted to open three branches," Farhad said. A firm can open up to 15 branches. Brokerage firms will be required to have paid-up capital of Tk 50 lakh for each outlet after the first three. Meanwhile, the stock market regulator approved the IPO of Republic Insurance worth Tk 9 crore. The company won approval to float 9 lakh shares each at Tk 100. "The company's paid-up capital is Tk 6 crore while its net asset value and earnings per share is Tk 122.93 and Tk 17.20," said Farhad. The SEC also approved issuance of right shares of Trust Bank at the 1:5 ratio. "The bank is permitted to issue one right share against five existing shares," said the SEC official. bdn
