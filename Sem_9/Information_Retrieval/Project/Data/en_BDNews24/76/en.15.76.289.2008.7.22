<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 22 (bdnews24.com)The High Court Tuesday granted bail to businessman Giasuddin Al Mamun in a case involving charges of not submitting a wealth information. Justice Abdul Awal of the High Court Division passed the order on a bail appeal by Mamun, widely known as a friend of former prime minister Khaleda Zia's son Tarique Rahman. The Anticorruption Commission on Feb 18 last year asked 50 people, including Mamun, to submit their wealth statements to the graft watchdog within 72 hours from notification. ACC deputy director Akhter Hamid Bhuiyan on April 5 last year field a corruption case against Mamun for failure to submit his wealth statement by the deadline. In the case, the Dhaka special judge's court on June 7 last year sentenced Mamun to three years in jail. Mamun appealed to the High Court against the trial court verdict. The bail to Mamun in the case will remain effective until disposal of his appeal. Barrister Fakhrul Islam took part in the hearing on behalf of Mamun. "Though Mamun won bail in this case as there are other cases against him he will not be released from jail right now," Islam said. bdnew
