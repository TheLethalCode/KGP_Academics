 Dhaka, July 19 (bdnews24.com)  The Keya 24th National Age Group (From 8-18) Swimming Championship gets underway Sunday at the Mirpur Swimming Complex with over 500 swimmers taking part in it. Bangladesh Swimming Federation (BSF) general secretary retired commodore MS Kabir disclosed it at a press conference at the National Sports Council Saturday. Some 517 swimmers from 41 clubs, 34 districts, two educational boards, two organisations and one divisional sports association will compete in 98 events. Before the start of the meet, a dispute has loomed over the championship as a Narayanganj official alleged that he and his kids were forced to stay the whole night out of their room in the Mirpur Krira Pallli as the tournament officials occupied their room at 11:00mp Friday night. The BSF general secretary told reporters that they found truth in incident and warned those officials not to do it again. The BSF ad-hoc committee had almost lost their long serving sponsor Keya Cosmetic, whose managing director Abdul Khaled Pathan was kind enough to sponsor the meet again. Sponsor representative, Anisur Rahman Dipu, also alleged that their company had decided to pull out of the swimming championship following what he called the ignorance of the federation during the Indo-Bangladesh Bangla Games, but its MD decided alone decided not to. Dipu alleged that during the Games one of the federation high-ups put a bank advertisement inside the Swimming Complex in place of their advertisement after forcing them to bring it down. Dipu urged the officials not to act in such a manner that would force the sponsors to go away from sports. Federation senior vice president Solaiman apologised for the incident and promised that it would not happen again.
