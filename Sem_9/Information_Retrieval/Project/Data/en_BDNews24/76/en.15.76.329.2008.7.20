 Dhaka, July 20 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court on Sunday granted permission to the Anticorruption Commission to hold a 'jail gate' interrogation of detained former prime minister Khaleda Zia and her son Tarique Rahman in an embezzlement case. The ACC filed the case with Ramna police against Khaleda, Tarique, and five others on July 3, on charges of embezzling Tk 2.10 core from the Trust. Additional chief metropolitan magistrate for Dhaka Md Golam Rabbani granted permission to interrogate the former prime minister and her son after ACC deputy assistant director Harun Ur Rashid sought permission from the CMM court. According to case details, a foreign organisation donated Tk 4.44 crore for the welfare of orphans of Bangladesh on June 9, 1991. The money was deposited with the Prime Minister's Orphanage Fund in Sonali Bank's Ramna branch opened by Khaleda Zia when she was in power. The Zia Orphanage Trust was formed in 1993, and the amount was disbursed to the Trust's Bogra and Bagerhat branches. Tk 2.33 crore was allocated to Bogra but only a fraction of it was spent. The remaining Tk 2.10 crore lay idle for 13 years and eventually swelled to Tk 3.37 crore, thanks to interest rates. An ACC investigation found that a large part of the money was not spent on the welfare of orphans and was splurged for other purposes. Others accused in the case include former BNP lawmakers Kazi Salimul Haque, Syed Ahmed, Gias Uddin Ahmed, Sharfuddin Ahmed and Mominur Rahman. The ACC investigation found that Tarique Rahman and Mominur Rahmannephew of former president Ziaur Rahmanwithdrew the Tk 3.37 crore in 2006 in three installments and deposited it with Prime Bank. The money was later dispersed using the accounts of Kazi Salimul Haque, Syed Ahmed, Gias Uddin Ahmed and Sharfuddin Ahmed. bdnews
