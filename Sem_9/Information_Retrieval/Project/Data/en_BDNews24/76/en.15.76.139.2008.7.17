 Dhaka, July 17 (bdnews24.com) Chief Election Commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said Thursday that the government is not deploying armed forces to handle law and order during the upcoming city and municipal polls. After attending a meeting to review the law and order situation ahead of the local polls, held at the National Economic Council auditorium, Huda told reporters the focus would be on keeping known criminals from muscling in on local polls. "To maintain law and order ahead of the elections known criminals will be taken into custody and illegal arms will be recovered prior to the polls." Admitting that at least half of the 13 election zones have markedly risky polling centres, the CEC added: "At those centres identified as risky, the law enforcers will maintain a three-tier vigilance operationthe first tier will be at the centre, the second tier will consist of mobile teams and the third will be a striking force for tackling any kind of adversity." During the press briefing, the CEC was accompanied by election commissioners Md Sahul Hossain and M Sakhawat Hossain, and EC secretary Muhammad Humayun Kabir. bdnews24.c
