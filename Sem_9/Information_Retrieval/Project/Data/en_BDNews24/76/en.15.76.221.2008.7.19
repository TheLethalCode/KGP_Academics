<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 19 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) is considering a local coach for the national team ahead of the Mardeka Cup in Malaysia in October. BFF president Kazi Salahuddin told reporters that the federation was going to appoint a local coach for the national side in the Mardeka Cup as they were still to find a foreign coach. Mardeka Cup is Asia's oldest football tournament held annually in Kuala Lumpur since 1957. "I don't want to make any mistake by appointing a foreign coach hurriedly. I'd better wait for some time to find a good coach for the national team," said Salahuddin adding that the national team management committee (NTMC) would choose the local coach. BFF vice president and NTMC chairman Badal Roy said that the committee planned to appoint a local person this time and had almost reached a consensus on it. He did not want to name the coach before approval. However, a BFF source said that there was a strong chance of appointing a coach other than the paid BFF coaches and Shafiqul Islam Manik might get charge of the national team.
