 NEW DELHI, Tue Jul 15, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Recent steps taken by the government are aimed at sustaining the economic growth momentum and taming inflation despite a surge in global oil prices, the prime minister said on Tuesday. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said in a statement the steps taken by the government would insulate the poor from the adverse impacts of inflation.

The Indian economy has grown by 9 percent in fiscal 2007/08 but the central bank expects it to moderate to 8-8.5 percent this fiscal year
