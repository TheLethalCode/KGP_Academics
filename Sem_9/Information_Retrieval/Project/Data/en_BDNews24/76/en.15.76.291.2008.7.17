 Dhaka, July 17 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh will host Pakistan in a five-match one-day international series in March 2009, said a Bangladesh Cricket Board official Thursday. BCB cricket operations chairman Gazi Ashraf Hossain Lipu said that Pakistan would play five ODIs against Bangladesh in March 2009 under the bilateral agreement between the two boards. Lipu said that Pakistan's tour of Bangladesh in March would be out of the ICC Future Tour Programme (FTP) as Bangladesh also toured Pakistan to play a five-match ODI series last April beyond the ICC FTP. The BCB Thursday approved a Tk 57 crore deficit budget for 2008-09 fiscal and Lipu felt that Pakistan's tour of Bangladesh next year would help them reduce the deficit. bdn
