<TITLE> Obama arrives in Afghanistan: campaign aide </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Washington, July 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama arrived in Afghanistan on Saturday, his campaign said. "At approximately 3:15 a.m. EDT, I received a phone call telling me that Senator Obama had landed at the airport in Kabul, Afghanistan," Robert Gibbs, a top aide to the Illinois senator, said in a written statement. Obama left the United States on Thursday and stopped first in Kuwait, where he visited troops, Gibbs said. Before departing for the trip in which he will also visit Iraq, Obama told reporters he expected to do a lot of listening. "I want to, obviously, talk to the commanders and get a sense, both in Afghanistan and in Baghdad of ... what ... their biggest concerns are. And I want to thank our troops for the heroic work that they've been doing," Obama said, just before boarding a military plane for the trip to Kuwait. Obama has called for adding two brigades or about 7,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan and shifting from what he said was a "single-minded" focus on Iraq by the Bush administration. He has called for removing U.S. combat troops from Iraq within 16 months. The United States has about 36,000 troops in Afghanistan. Some 17,500 form part of a 53,000-strong NATO-led force that is tackling rising insurgent violence. The senator is also planning to stop next week in Jordan, Israel, Germany, France and Britain. He is trying to counter accusations by Sen. John McCain, his Republican rival in the November 4 election, that he lacks the foreign-policy seasoning to serve as commander in chief. Asked whether he would have some tough talk for Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Iraqi President Nuri al-Maliki, Obama replied, "I'm more interested in listening than doing a lot of talking." "And I think it is very important to recognize that I'm going over there as a U.S. senator. We have one president at a time, so it's the president's job to deliver those messages," Obama added. Joining Obama in the congressional delegation were Jack Reed, a Democratic senator from Rhode Island, and Sen. Chuck Hagel, a Republican from Nebraska.
