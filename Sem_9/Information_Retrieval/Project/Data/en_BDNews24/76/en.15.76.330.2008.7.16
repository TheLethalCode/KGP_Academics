 LONDON, July 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil steadied on Wednesday, after a sharp fall the previous session on expectations that a faltering economy in top energy consumer the United States would hit demand growth. Prices had plunged more than $6 in the previous session, the steepest in dollar terms in 17 years. US crude was 25 cents down up at $138.49 a barrel by 0659 GMT, after briefly dropping by more than $1 to $137.22 a barrel. On Tuesday the market saw its biggest one-day fall since 1991, when prices tumbled after the US began bombing Iraq in the first Gulf War. London Brent crude was 30 cents down at $138.45 a barrel. "I think what happened yesterday, especially with the dollar weakening, suggests that the market is taking a little more focus on the real fundamentals," said Mark Pervan, head of commodity research at ANZ. US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the weak housing market and high energy and food prices were putting additional stress on a US economy already under considerable strain from the credit crisis fallout.. Prices had tumbled even though the US dollar fell to a record low against the euro on Tuesday before recovering some ground. Investors have pumped cash into oil and other commodities this year looking to hedge against inflation and the weak dollar, which has helped drive crude oil up about 50 percent this year to a record above $147 a barrel earlier in July. The world's top oil exporter Saudi Arabia wants to see lower oil prices, Saudi King Abdullah said in an interview with an Italian newspaper. "When the price of oil hovered around $100 a barrel, we were already unhappy. Imagine what we feel now, when there is talk of $200," he said. Oil's six-year rally has been driven partly by ballooning demand from developing economies such as China and India. But consumers in large economies like the United States, already feeling the pinch of the credit crunch and housing crisis, have begun to scale back on energy use, with retail gasoline demand down more than 5 percent last week from a year ago, according to MasterCard Advisors. "The market is coming to the realization that OECD demand is going to start contracting, even OPEC has trimmed demand growth," Pervan said. OPEC on Tuesday cut its global demand forecast for 2008 for the fourth time this year, adding that consumption would continue to slow in 2009. A Reuters poll ahead of weekly US inventory data due later on Wednesday forecast a 2.1 million barrel fall in US crude stocks last week, while gasoline inventories are forecast to have dropped 400,000 barrels and distillates to have risen by 2.0 million barrels
