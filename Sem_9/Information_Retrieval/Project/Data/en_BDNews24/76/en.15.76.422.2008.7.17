The search follows the decision of John Bracewell to return to coaching English country side Gloucestershire next season. "New Zealand Cricket seeks an experienced, passionate, outstanding leader to build on the team's solid foundation and take the Blackcaps to the next level of achievement," NZ Cricket said in the advertisement for job on its website. Applications close on August 4. NZ Cricket said it wants someone who has coached at an elite level in the past 12 months; has a proven track record as a world class coach, outstanding leadership, communication and people management skills; and a willingness to be judged on results. "NZ Cricket's stated strategic goal is for the Blackcaps to be sustainably number one or two in the world in both forms of the game and to regularly win world tournaments and series," it said. New Zealand, ranked third in the world in the one day game and seventh in test matches, recently toured England where it lost the test series 2-0, but took the one-day series 3-1.
