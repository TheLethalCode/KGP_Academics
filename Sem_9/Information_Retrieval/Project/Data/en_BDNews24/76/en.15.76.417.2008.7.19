<TITLE> Obama in Afghanistan to sound out commanders </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KABUL, July 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama was in Afghanistan on Saturday to talk to NATO commanders and U.S. troops about the war he says is not getting enough attention from the Bush administration. Obama made Afghanistan the first stop on an overseas trip aimed at proving his foreign policy credentials. He will also visit Iraq, Jordan, Israel, Germany, France and Britain. "I want to, obviously, talk to the commanders and get a sense, both in Afghanistan and in Baghdad of ... what ... their biggest concerns are," he told reporters before boarding a military flight from the United States. "And I want to thank our troops for the heroic work that they've been doing." Obama wants to send two more brigades, or about 7,000 U.S. troops, to Afghanistan to shift emphasis from what he calls the Bush administration's "single-minded" focus on Iraq. He has called for a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq in 16 months. The United States has about four times more troops in Iraq than the 36,000 it has in Afghanistan. But more of its soldiers were killed in Afghanistan in both May and June than in Iraq. It is over six years since U.S.-led and Afghan forces toppled the Taliban for sheltering al Qaeda leaders behind the September 11 attacks, but violence has risen sharply in recent months and there are few signs the insurgency is weakening. Obama's Republican presidential rival, John McCain, also wants to send three more brigades to Afghanistan and pledged to find the extra troops by "asking NATO to send more and by sending U.S. troops as they become available." But despite the violence, many Afghanistan analysts doubted sending more troops was the answer. "I don't think decreasing or increasing troop numbers is going to yield a long-term stability here, or peace," said Matt Waldman, policy adviser to Oxfam International. More effective aid, rural development and conflict resolution at a local level are the real priorities, he said. Foreign spending on aid and development is dwarfed by that spent on military operations in Afghanistan. The U.S. military alone now spends some $100 million a day, aid agencies say, compared with $7 million a day spent by all aid donors. Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said whether Obama or McCain wins the November 4 election, pulling troops out in the shorter term would be better for Iraq. Asked in an interview with Germany's Der Spiegel magazine when U.S. troops should leave Iraq, he said: "As far as we are concerned, as soon as possible. U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama talks about 16 months. That, we think, would be the right timeframe for a withdrawal, with the possibility of slight changes," Maliki said. OBAMA "LISTENING, NOT TALKING" McCain criticized Obama for announcing his strategy on Afghanistan before leaving for the fact-finding trip. "Apparently, he's confident enough that he won't find any facts that might change his opinion or alter his strategy. Remarkable," McCain said in his weekly radio spot. "This is similar to the mistake Senator Obama made when he confidently declared that the surge in Iraq could not possibly reduce sectarian violence there," he said. "And it is precisely the success of the surge in Iraq that shows us the way to victory over the Taliban." Asked whether he would have some tough talk for Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Maliki, Obama said: "I'm more interested in listening than doing a lot of talking. "And I think it is very important to recognize that I'm going over there as a U.S. senator. We have one president at a time, so it's the president's job to deliver those messages." Obama last week criticized Karzai in an interview with CNN. "I think the Karzai government has not gotten out of the bunker and helped to organize Afghanistan," he said.
