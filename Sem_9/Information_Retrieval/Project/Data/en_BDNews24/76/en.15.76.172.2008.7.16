 MILAN, July 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ronaldinho arrived at AC Milan's training ground on Wednesday where he was due to undergo a medical and sign a three-year contract. Barcelona agreed late on Tuesday to sell the Brazil forward for an initial fee of 21 million euros ($33.5 million) following two days of talks with Milan chief executive Adriano Galliani. Ronaldinho and Galliani flew into Milan earlier on Wednesday and went straight to the Milanello training ground where the squad was gathering for the first day of pre-season work. Some 4,000 fans were outside the gates to welcome the 28-year-old playmaker, who was FIFA World Player of the Year in 2004 and 2005 but struggled last season with form and fitness. The formalities of the move will be concluded over the next couple of days and he will then be presented to the media. Milan endured a tough time last season, losing their Champions League crown after falling to Arsenal in the last 16 and then finishing fifth in Serie A and only qualifying for the UEFA Cup this term. Coach Carlo Ancelotti has been under huge pressure in the last few months but he said he was thrilled to get back to work after the close season break with Ronaldinho's arrival making him even happier. Italy fullback Gianluca Zambrotta and France midfielder Mathieu Flamini were other notable buys from Barca and Arsenal. "The club has made a great sacrifice and has bought outstanding players," Ancelotti told reporters, aware that the Milan's coffers are not as full as they used to be. "With what is at our disposal we can count on being competitive on all fronts. Ronaldinho will bring lots of enthusiasm and that enthusiasm is a fundamental component to start the season well. "Some years ago he was considered the best player in the world, here at Milan he will find the right atmosphere to relaunch himself.
