 Dhaka, July 17 (bdnews24.com) - Khaleda Zia's detained younger son Arafat Rahman Coco is expected to be released sometime Thursday afternoon, said one of his lawyers. Dhaka additional chief metropolitan magistrate Md Golam Rabbani, earlier in the day, exempted Coco from personally appearing in court in a case filed by Anticorruption Commission on charges of concealing wealth information. After submitting documents to the home ministry, on Coco's exemption from court, lawyer Sanaullah Miah told reporters Thursday noon: "He will be released by government executive order later this afternoon." Home adviser MA Matin told reporters: "We have completed our work. Coco is being released for eight weeks on parole for treatment." Asked about the release of Khaleda Zia and her elder son Tarique Rahman, the adviser told bdnews24.com: "You will know in time." Quoting Coco's wife Sharmila Rahman, lawyer Sanaullah said: "Immediately after release [Coco] will be taken to Bangkok for treatment. Steps haves been taken to arrange the necessary funds for this, as bank accounts remain frozen." "Coco will be taken abroad as soon as possible," he added. On the process of releasing Tarique, the lawyer said: "We have heard the matter of his release is also under consideration." In Thursday's petition for Coco's exemption from the ACC graft case hearings, his lawyers said he needs to be sent abroad for better treatment according to recommendation of the medical board. Coco was arrested on September 3, 2007, as an accused in the GATCO corruption case. He has also been exempted from court on medical grounds for hearings of the GATCO case. However, another lawyer Zainal Abedin Mesbah said Coco is yet to be exempted in a third case involving extortion charges. bdnews24.
