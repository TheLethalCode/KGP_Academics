 Barisal, July 16 (bdnews24.com)  A student activist and 'listed criminal' died in an exchange of gunfire with the Rapid Action Battalion in Barisal early Wednesday, RAB and police said. The dead man was identified as Moshiul Alam Sentu (35), president of Barisal metropolitan Chhatra Dal and central Chhatra Dal vice president. RAB-8 lieutenant commander KM Mamunur Rashid told bdnews24.com that RAB-3 members had detained Sentu at Dhaka University campus on Tuesday and handed him over to RAB-8. Based on the students activist's statement, the elite group went to Kashipur-Lakotia road to recover a stash of arms around 4am Wednesday morning. Sentu's associates fired at the RAB officers, said Rashid, and as RAB returned fire the Chhatra Dal leader received bullet wounds and died on the spot. The elite force seized one AK-47, one shotgun, one pistol and a huge cache of ammunitions from the spot, but failed to arrest anybody, said the RAB-8 officer.
