 NEW DELHI, Tue Jul 22,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A vote of confidence debate in India's parliament on Tuesday was adjourned after opposition lawmakers interrupted the session and waved wads of cash they said were offered as bribes to abstain. The government is scheduled to face a confidence vote later on Tuesday that will decide the fate of a civilian nuclear deal with the United States and could trigger a snap election. Television channels estimated the Congress-led coalition that negotiated the deal would sneak home by half a dozen or more votes against its former communist allies and opposition parties led by the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). But it was unclear when and if the vote would be held after opposition MPs interrupted proceedings by brandishing wads of cash, and demanding an inquiry. "This is not a case of corruption for a small favor. This is an important event for the House," BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani told reporters outside parliament. "I have to say that the House has to seriously take it up." Advani alleged the three opposition MPs were given a total of 10 million rupees ($235,000) by government supporters as an advance payment for abstaining, and were offered much more. Congress said the allegations were baseless. "This is all a drama, and it has been planted deliberately by the people who know they have lost the vote," said Congress spokesman Ashwini Kumar. "We are seriously looking into the allegations but the opposition knows we will win so they are resorting to such activities." Accusations of horse-trading have swirled for days as both sides try to attract the support of smaller, regional or caste-based parties. MARKETS RALLY Investors are expecting a narrow win for the government, and bookmakers also favor the government. That feeling has helped shares recover after a string of losses, the main share index rising by more than 10 percent in the last three sessions and a further 1.8 percent on Tuesday. If the government falls there will probably be an election this year. It is also likely to lead to the scrapping of the civilian nuclear agreement and throw economic policy into limbo just as inflation rises to a 13-year-high. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh moved the confidence motion with a brief address on Monday, and is scheduled to make a full defense of the nuclear deal and his government's record in a concluding speech. But that speech, expected around 5 p.m. (1130 GMT or 7:30 a.m. EDT), is now likely to be delayed. Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram, in a speech frequently interrupted by shouting from the opposition benches, defended the government's record and said nuclear power was vital if the country was to emulate the economic success of China. "This government under Dr. Manmohan Singh's leadership is charting out a new path which will end India's nuclear isolation, which will pave the way for India becoming an economic superpower," he said. "I ask this house to give a resounding vote of confidence." The nuclear deal would grant India access to foreign nuclear fuel and technology, unlocking $40 billion in investment over the next 15 years, according to an Indian business lobby group. But the communists withdrew their support for the government in protest over the deal, saying it made India a pawn of Washington. The BJP says the nuclear deal limits India's ability to test nuclear weapons. The vote is so close several MPs who are ill were being flown or wheeled in on hospital beds, and others, in jail for crimes such as murder and extortion, have been granted temporary release and arrived at parliament on Tuesday in prison vans. A government defeat would be a boost for the BJP, which has won a string of state elections this year against a backdrop of rising inflation and criticism that millions of poor Indians were not benefiting from the booming economy. It would also boost the standing of Mayawati, leader of an increasingly influential party drawing much of its support from Dalits, formerly known as "untouchables". Mayawati is trying to project herself as a third force and possible prime minister and has tried to wean away votes from the government. BJP leader Advani said his party did not oppose nuclear cooperation or a strategic relationship with the United States, but said the nuclear deal made India "a subservient partner"
