<TEXT>
 Sumon K Chakrabarti New Delhi, July 21, 2008  Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's motion to seek a trust vote in his government has left his government hanging in the balance until the members of parliament make their choice clear on Tuesday. The Indian parliament debated the controversial Indo-US Nuclear Deal on Monday, , as a result of which the alliance of Leftist parties has withdrawn support from Singh's government, reducing it to a minority. "I have repeatedly assured all, including the Left parties, that I myself would come to the guidance of parliament before operationalising the nuclear deal, if we were allowed to go to the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) to finalise the India-specific safeguards agreement)," said Singh in the Lok Sabha. But opposition leader from the right-wing Bharatiya Janata party Lala Krishna Advani said that the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government has been reduced to a "patient in an ICU". But as the government and the opposition accused each other of compromising national interest and creating a political crisis during the on the vote of confidence, it was clear that the number game is destined for a photo-finish. Amid allegations of buying MPs from all sides, UPA is now banking on the 10 MPs from the opposition National Democratic Alliance (NDA) who may not show up. The government and the opposition were, till two days back, within striking distance of each other in the numbers game a day before the floor test. But the abstentions might just make the key difference. While the UPA needs 272 MPs for a majority in the 547 member house. According to latest projections, there were 269 MPs for the Government, 268 against it and four lawmakers are still undecided. The trust vote moved by Singh on Monday is the ninth taken in the Lok Sabha in nearly three decades since 1979. Of the eight trust votes taken in the last 29 years, the government of the day won six while in two cases the incumbent prime ministers simply resigned without facing the house.
