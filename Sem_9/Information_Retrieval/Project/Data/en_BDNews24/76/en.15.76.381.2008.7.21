<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 21 (bdnews24.com) - 'Disputed' former goalkeeper Syed Hasan Kanon has been drafted in the National Team Management Committee (NTMC) again as the Bangladesh Football Federation Monday declared a nine-member full NTM committee. BFF president Kazi Salahuddin had earlier appointed vice president Badal Roy the NTMC chairman and asked him to complete the committee. Asked why 'disputed' Kanon was in the NTMC, Roy said, "I don't know about it." Sheikh Russel Krira Chakra president Nurul Islam Chowdhury has been appointed deputy chairman while former national booters Golam Rabbani Helal, Khurshid Alam Babul, Sheikh Mohammad Aslam, Hasanuzzaman Khan Bablu, Imtiaz Ahmed Johnny, Syed Hasan Kanon and organiser Ekramul Karim Chowdhury were made members. Kanon, a former BFF executive committee member and co-coordinator of the NTMC during the period of SA Sultan, allegedly went into hiding after the Fakhruddin Ahmed-led- caretaker government took over. Some sports organisers allegedly made money by using their offices to get contracts from the National Sports Council during the BNP-led government, and Kanon was one of them, according to a report filed by bdnews24.com on June 23, 2007. Kanon allegedly earned nearly Tk 4. 57 crore from four contracts, including for ground development at Kishoreganj stadium, supplying building materials for the Dhanmondi Women's Complex and upgrading the Dhanmondi Gymnasium, according to NSC sources.
