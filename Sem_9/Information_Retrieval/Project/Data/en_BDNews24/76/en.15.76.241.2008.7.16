<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 16 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Wednesday extended the bail term for Dhaka mayor Sadek Hossain Khoka to July 31 in a graft case filed by the Anticorruption Commission. The proceedings of the case will also remain on hold until July 31, according to a HC order delivered by justices Sharif Uddin Chaklader and Emdadul Haque. The High Court on July 7 granted bail to Khoka and stayed the proceedings of the graft case to July 16 after a trial court issued an arrest warrant against him. Metropolitan senior special judge Md Azizul Haque had earlier issued the arrest order. The court had approved the warrant after accepting a chargesheet submitted by the ACC against Khoka, his wife and children. The ACC charged the mayor on July 1 with having earnings beyond his known income and concealing wealth-related information. A lawyer for Khoka's wife Ismat Ara asked the court Monday for a reinvestigation into the case claiming that the ACC's chargesheet was faulty and incomplete. The court rejected the plea, but ordered a halt to the charges against Ismat Ara due to a stay order by the High Court. ACC assistant director Md Shamsul Alam filed the case with Ramna Police Station on April 2 against Khoka, his wife and children. bdnew
