 COLOMBO, July 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Unorthodox spin bowler Ajantha Mendis is set to make his test debut for Sri Lanka against India this week after he was included in a 14-man squad named for the opener of a three-match series on Monday. The 23-year-old Mendis is expected to be promoted to the test side after his spectacular performance in the Asia Cup final in Pakistan on July 6, where he claimed six wickets for 13 runs to help Sri Lanka overcome India. The finger spinner, who bowls a mixture of off breaks, leg breaks, googlies and top spinners, is likely to form an intimidating partnership with world record wicket taker Muttiah Muralitharan. In the opening test, starting in Colombo on Wednesday, Sri Lanka should line up with just two fast bowlers with either left-armer Thilan Thushara or right-arm seamer Nuwan Kulasekera taking the new ball with Chaminda Vaas. Fast bowler Dilhara Fernando was ruled out after suffering knee pain during a three-day practice game against India over the weekend. Sri Lanka Squad: Mahela Jayawardene (captain), Kumar Sangakkara, Malinda Warnapura, Thilan Samaweera, Michael Vandort, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Chamara Silva, Chamara Kapugedera, Thilan Thushara, Chaminda Vaas, Prasanna Jayawardene, Muttiah Muralitharan, Ajantha Mendis, Nuwan Kulaseke
