 Dhaka, July 15 (bdnews24.com)The High Court issued a rule nisi Tuesday, asking the government and the Election Commission to explain why the schedule for elections to four city corporations and nine municipalities without a final voter list would not be declared illegal. The court however, rejected an appeal to suspend the elections. A High Court bench of Justices Iman Ali and Md Emdadul Haque after hearing for two days a writ petition field by three lawyers including Jamaat leader Jasim Uddin Sarker, issued the order. The chief adviser, Election Commission, the cabinet secretary, the law secretary, and the secretary to the President have been asked to reply to the rule in the next eight days. The court ordered the writ petitioners to deliver the rule to the defendants by special messengers. Barrister Masud Reza Sobhan participated in the hearing on behalf of the writ petitioners, assisted by advocate Tajul Islam. At the hearing, Sobhan said the election must be held in line with the new voter list, according to a new ordinance. "But no new voter list has yet been prepared. So the election could not be held. No free, fair and neutral election could be held without a new voter list," Sobhan said. The lawyer also said the High Court in a verdict on March 27 last year said all elections must be held according to a new voter list. "So, according to the verdict, no election could be held without one." Sobhan said the City Corporation and Municipality Rules say that no political party can participate in the city and municipal elections. The schedule for elections to four city corporations and nine municipalities was announced on June 20. The elections will be held on August 4. Election commissioner M Sohul Hussain told bdnews24.com, "Such writ petitions carry no meaning. We are holding the city corporation and municipal elections in line with a fresh voter list." bdnews24.
