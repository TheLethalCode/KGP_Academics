 Dhaka, July 15 (bdnews24.com)  A probe body on Bangladesh's failure in the South Asian Football Championship submitted its report to the Bangladesh Football Federation president Kazi Salahuddin Tuesday, the deadline for submission. "We were asked to submit a report on the Bangladesh failure in the SAFF Championship and we had looked into the off and on field matters," said Haroon-or-Rashid, conveynor of the three-member committee, which also included BFF members Anwarul Haq Helal and Sirajul Islam Bachchu. Haroon without elaborating said that they had recommended steps so that the BFF could avoid such a situation in future. Asked about their recommendations, Haroon, a former BFF general secretary, said that it depended on the BFF president whether he would disclose the report. It was, however, learnt that the committee found that the players were not united following disagreements among them. Though Coach Abu Yousuf in his report alleged that he faced interference from others during the SAFF campaign, the committee did not find anything in this regard. Haroon said that the committee had interviewed 11 persons  team manager Sheikh Mohammad Aslam, team leader Shafiquzzaman, team doctor Chisti, head coach Abu Yousuf, assistant coach Choton, captain Aminul Haq, vice captain Biplob Bhattacharya, striker Jahid Hasan Emily, national team management committee chairman Badal Roy, BFF members Sattyajit Das Rupu and Hasanuzzaman Bablu. Bangladesh, three times SAFF finalists, failed to qualify for the semifinals of the 5th SAFF Championship in Sri Lanka and the Maldives in June last. The BFF on June 18 formed a probe committee after finding dissimilarities among the reports of the coach, team manager and team leader.
