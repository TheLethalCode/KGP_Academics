<TITLE> Kabul bomb, politics overshadow India-Pakistan talks </TITLE>

 NEW DELHI, July 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's top foreign official travels to India next week to resume peace talks but suspicion of Pakistan's hand in last week's deadly bomb attack on the Indian embassy in Kabul could overshadow progress. While ties have warmed since a peace process started in 2004, after the countries nearly went to a fourth war, there has been little progress in their main dispute over Kashmir, and both suspect each other's involvement in revolts raging in border areas. The Indian government also faces a confidence vote in parliament on Tuesday and with doubts about its survival, analysts say there will no breakthroughs between the two sides. Efforts to build trust received a setback last week when India's national security adviser blamed Pakistan's intelligence service for a suicide car-bomb attack in Kabul that killed 41 people, including two Indian diplomats. Analysts say the attack will reinforce India's fear Pakistan's new civilian government, formed four months ago, had failed to clamp down on state-sponsored violence towards India. "Tensions on account of terrorism will continue," G. Parthasarathy, India's former High Commissioner to Islamabad, told Reuters. "It is clear the civilian government has no control over the terrorist activities directed against India." India accuses Pakistan of backing a 20-year-old separatist revolt in Kashmir, which both sides claim in full but rule in part, and trying to hit Indian interests abroad. In the last two years India has suffered bomb attacks by suspected Islamist militants on cities outside Kashmir, including Mumbai, New Delhi, Hyderabad, Varanasi, and in May, Jaipur. Pakistan has denied a hand in these attacks, and for its part is suspicious of the role of Indian consulates in Afghanistan. Senior Pakistani military officers and bureaucrats privately accuse India of helping separatists wage a low-level insurgency in the western province of Baluchistan. They also say India is helping to destabilise the Pashtun tribal region on the Afghan border as it takes Pakistani troops away from the Indian border. POLITICAL LIMBO Yet, the two sides will want to be seen as engaging on a host of issues, including confidence-building measures (CBMs), co-operation on terrorism and the Kashmir dispute. "There maybe some cosmetic progress on the CBMs, but nothing substantial," B. Raman, former head of India's external spy agency, said. "They need to be seen as talking." India is under no pressure to make concessions on Kashmir and no one is expecting a breakthrough when Indian and Pakistani foreign secretaries meet on July 21-22. But before the lull in peace efforts amid political turmoil in Pakistan, both sides had made some progress with border disputes, one over the Siachen glacier in the Himalayas, the other over the Sir Creek on their maritime boundary. Analysts say building on those gains looked unlikely, thanks to doubts about the survival of the Indian government. "All eyes are on the vote, and at this point no government will make an issue of Siachen or Sir Creek," Raman said. As India's ruling coalition faces a confidence vote after its communist allies withdrew support protesting a nuclear deal with the United States, decisions on key issues have been put on hold. "Because of the uncertainty of the (vote) outcome, certain things are on hold," said Suresh Tendulkar, member of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's economic council.
