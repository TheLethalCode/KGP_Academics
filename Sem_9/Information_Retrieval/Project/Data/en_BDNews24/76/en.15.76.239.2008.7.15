 Dhaka, July 15 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court on Tuesday acquitted former president HM Ershad in a graft case involving the controversial purchase of electronic news gathering (ENG) equipment during his term as president. After the verdict, by Dhaka Divisional Judge Md Golam Mortuza, Ershad told bdnews24.com that he had received justice and he hoped that he would be acquitted in the remaining cases against him. Handing down his verdict, the judge said that as Ershad resigned from his presidential post one day after installation of the ENG equipment he did not get the opportunity to use it. Of 21 witnesses in the case none of them could say clearly how much was misappropriated from state coffers in line with the charges, judge Golam Mortuza added. bdnews24
