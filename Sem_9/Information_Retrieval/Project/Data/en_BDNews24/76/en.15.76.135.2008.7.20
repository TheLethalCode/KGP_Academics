 KARACHI, July 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Stung by the doping controversies surrounding two of its key bowlers, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Sunday conducted drugs tests of the players named in its preliminary squad for the Champions Trophy. "The ICC (International Cricket Council) will also have dope tests in the tournament but the PCB itself has been very firm about its zero tolerance policy towards drugs," Sohail Saleem, a member of the board's medical commission, told Reuters. Batsmen Younis Khan, Bazid Khan and all-rounder Yasir Arafat were not tested as they were out of the country, Saleem added. Since the 2006 doping scandal involving Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Asif, where they escaped bans on appeal, Pakistan cricket has been rocked by doping issues. Asif was first detained in Dubai for 19 days in June for alleged possession of a contraband substance and this month the Indian Premier League announced he had tested positive during the Twenty20 competition in India. He is under suspension by the board and has asked for his "B" sample to be tested by World Anti-Doping Agency experts in Switzerland. Asif was dropped from the Champions Trophy preliminary squad. Fast bowler Akhtar said he was happy to take the test and had nothing to hide. "I am just keen to play in the Champions Trophy and get on with the game," he told reporters after the tests, which were undertaken by WADA-accredited officials. "I just need another two weeks to regain my full fitness and rhythm.
