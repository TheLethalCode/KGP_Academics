 Dhaka, July 20 (bdnews24.com)Former prime minister Khaleda Zia was not taken to court to attend the GATCO scam case hearing as she was reported ill. The jail authorities in a report to the Special Judge's Court-3 said: "It was not possible to take Khaleda Zia to court as she was unwell." Judge Md Shahed Nooruddin asked defence lawyers to give the court a copy on July 24 of a High Court order that stayed proceedings of the case against Khaleda for two months. The HC stayed the trial of the case on July 15 on a writ petition filed by Khaleda, who challenged the legality of the case and its proceedings against her. Fifteen other accused in the case including Jamaat-e-Islami chief Motiur Rahman Nizami were present in court Sunday. Khaleda's son Arafat Rahman Coco was exempted from court appearance in the case. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case with Tejgaon police on Sept 2 last year against 13 people including Khaleda, Coco and Nizami, for awarding Global Agro Trade Company a cargo-handling deal through misuse of power. The anti-graft body pressed charges against 25 people on May 13. bdnew
