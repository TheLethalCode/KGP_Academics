<TITLE> Sri Lanka military says captures key rebel camp </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 COLOMBO (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lankan troops have captured a strategically important Tamil Tiger camp on the islands western coast, the military said on Sunday, as government forces continue their push against the rebels' northern stronghold. The capture of the rebel base in the northwestern district of Mannar came three days after the military said it had struck a "fatal blow" against the Tigers by capturing the northwestern town of Vidattaltivu, the main base of the rebels' sea wing. "The army, with troops from 58 Division and Army Commandos captured the largest LTTE terrorist base in the Illupaikadavai area, about 10 km north of Vidattaltivu," said military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara, referring to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. "Troops have now advanced nearly 2 km ahead of Illupaikadavai and are now in the process of consolidating their positions." Nanayakkara also said 48-hour fighting in the area had killed 15 Tamil Tiger rebels for the loss of one soldier. Fighting in the 25-year civil war is now concentrated in the north after the Sri Lankan army, which has vowed to finish off the Tigers this year, drove the rebels out of their eastern enclave in 2007. The Tigers, fighting for an independent state in north and east Sri Lanka for ethnic Tamils, a minority in the predominantly Sinhalese country, were not immediately available for comment. Analysts say the military has the upper hand in the latest phase of the long-running war given superior air power, strength of numbers and swathes of terrain captured in the island's east. But they still see no clear winner on the horizon as the Tigers regularly retaliate with suicide attacks and roadside bombs, deterring some tourists and worrying investors in the $27 billion economy. An estimated 70,000 people have died since the civil war began in 1983.
