<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 17 (bdnews24.com)The government will take into account suggestions from any quarter on the Representation of People Ordinance 2008, an adviser said Thursday. "The cabinet has already approved the ordinance in principle. But if anybody gives opinion or advice before final approval that will be considered to smooth the political transition," education adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said in a joint press conference after dialogue with the Jatiya Party (Monju) at the Chief Adviser's Office Thursday. The government has so far held 27 rounds of dialogue with political parties, professional bodies and businessmen. Asked why a new ordinance is being formulated instead of amending the 1972 RPO, law adviser AF Hassan Ariff who was present at the press conference said: "The Election Commission has recommended formulation of the new ordinance." "We only scrutinised and reviewed the ordinance. The Election Commission can give a proper reply to why a new ordinance is being formulated instead of amending the old one." The Awami League in talks with the government had also demanded an amendment to the 1972 RPO instead of promulgating a new ordinance. At the news conference, JP secretary general Sheikh Shahidul Islam said: "We have made four recommendations for resolving the economic crisis, four for ending the political crisis and five for holding a free, fair, neutral and meaningful election." The education adviser said: "Many candidates with bad reputation are being seen in city corporation and municipal elections." "An adverse impact has been created in the public mind because of such candidates. It is not possible for the government alone to ensure qualitative change in politics." A nine-member delegation of the JP participated in the dialogue. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed led the government side. bdnews
