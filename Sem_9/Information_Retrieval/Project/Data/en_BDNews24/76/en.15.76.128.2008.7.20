The matches of the fifth zone, Dhaka, will start from July 25. The participating 23 districts would play knockout basis matches in the zonal phases and the champions from Jamalpur, Faridpur, Jhenaidah and Jessore zones and the champions and runners-up of the Dhaka zone will join Bangladesh Ansar in the seven-team finals in Dhaka, BKF general secretary Nazrul Islam said at a press conference at the National Sports Council Sunday. The National Women's Kabaddi Championship was last held in 1982 after the inaugural meet in 1977. "We have taken the initiative to revive the women's championship in a bid to give opportunity to Bangladesh Ansar, which consists of most national women players," said Islam adding that they had last organised the inter-district Kabaddi tournament in 2007. In a bid to give more exposure to the women players, the federation last year organised the women's kabaddi league along with different women tournaments, Islam added.

The finals of the championship will start on July 27 and the final will be held on July 30 at the Outer Stadium Kabaddi court. Jamalpur venue: Tangail, Jamalpur, Kishorganj and Sherpur.
