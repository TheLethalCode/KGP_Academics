 LEEDS, July 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England will have to monitor the workload of fit-again all-rounder Andrew Flintoff so he does not risk further injury, the team's bowling coach Ottis Gibson said on Saturday. Flintoff, playing his first test in 18 months after a fourth ankle operation and then a side strain, bowled 28 overs in four sessions by the close of day two of the second test against South Africa - with more work still to do in the tourists' first innings. He delivered 10 overs more than seamer Stuart Broad and the same as James Anderson. "I suppose because of the injuries that Freddie (Flintoff) has had you would think it was a concern but he has been doing all his rehab at Lancashire and training to be on the park," Gibson told reporters. "Obviously he has bowled quite a few overs now but if we didn't think Freddie was up to it I imagine he wouldn't be bowling that many overs. "It's something that we have to continue to look at and monitor. We don't want to bowl him into the ground as such but he has come through today and pulled up well on Friday. "He is doing his (preventative) work on the injuries that he has had, he is having his ice baths and all the other stuff that fast bowlers do, like having massages, and he is in good shape at the minute." Flintoff has been the most impressive performer in the innings so far and at tea he had the economical figures of one for 37 from 21 overs. South Africa's Hashim Amla praised his fellow batsman Ashwell Prince after he finished 134 not out at stumps. It was Prince's second hundred in as many tests. "Ashwell has been a star performer for us over the last couple of years," Amla told reporters. "His temperament is very good and he keeps his style very simple and sticks to his game-plan. Those last two hundreds he has made, here and at Lord's, are the two best I have seen him play.
