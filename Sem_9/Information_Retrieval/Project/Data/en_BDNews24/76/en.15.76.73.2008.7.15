<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 15 (bdnews24.com)The Anticorruption Commission has made "significant progress" in carrying out anticorruption drives since the caretaker government came to power last year, according to the primary findings of a UNDP study on sustainability of the commission. UNDP's resident representative Renata Dessallien, ACC director general (administration) Col Hanif Iqbal and the consultant of the research team Michael Th Johnson briefed reporters on the preliminary findings of the study carried out between June 12 and July 15. "The study found that the commission has made impressive progress in the past 18 months in building an effective anticorruption initiative in Bangladesh," Johnson said at a press conference at Sonargaon Hotel Tuesday. But the consultant did not mention any specific ACC measure that made his research team making such recommendations. The research was mainly based on the interviews of the ACC officials and other experts with some case studies. "The methodology of the study is very sound," he said without mentioning the number of people interviewed. "This is a sustainability study. The ACC needs to build its capacity to face the enormous challenges ahead," Johnson told bdnews24.com. The United Nations Development Programme carried out the research, requested by the ACC. "We will submit the report to the ACC through the UNDP in weeks," said Johnson. The consultant said all of the respondents without exception told that the ACC should sustain through future. "The ACC is taking both punitive measures and preventive actions to curb corruption," Johnson said. "The study is aimed at assessing the ACC and its sustainability. We rate the UNDP as the most impartial organisation in the country to conduct a research," said Iqbal. "One percent of Bangladesh GDP went down the drain every year owing to corruption. This is huge," said Renata Dessallien. Dessallien praised the performance of the ACC to cut corruption in the country. bdn
