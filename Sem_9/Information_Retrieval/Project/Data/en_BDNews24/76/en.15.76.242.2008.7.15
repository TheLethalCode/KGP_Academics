 Dhaka, July 15 (bdnews24.com)  Jamaat-e-Islami chief Motiur Rahman Nizami was freed Tuesday on bail in the GATCO case filed by the Anticorruption Commission. Full Story Nizami was accompanied by fellow party officials Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed and Delwar Hossain Saidee when he left the Prisoners' Cell at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital, where he had been under treatment. "Lift emergency, free Khaleda Zia," the Jamaat chief was heard saying to a crowd of reporters and TV crew. As he arrived home, in city's Moghbazar area, the Jamaat leader was flanked by party activists and could not be reached by reporters. His release came a day after he won interim bail for two months from the High Court. Nizami spent about two months behind bars and became the first senior politician to be out on bail after being accused of corruption since the 1/11 changeover. The police arrested Nizami at his Maghbazar home on the rain-drenched night of May 18 amid protests by several hundred party supporters. A former minister in the previous BNP-Jamaat coalition government, Nizami was the last of the chiefs of the three major political partiesafter Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Ziato have been arrested in an anticorruption crackdown by the interim government. Speaking to bdnews24.com, inspector general (prisons) Brigadier General Md Zakir Hasan and DIG Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui had confirmed receipt of a copy of the High Court bail order which cleared the way for his release. Nizami was released since there was "no other case" against the Jamaat chief, Zakir Hasan explained. Contacted, several senior Awami League leaders refused to comment on his bail and subsequent release. In the GATCO graft case, his co-accused included former prime minister Khaleda Zia, her son and other former ministers and officials. The Anticorruption Commission pressed charges on May 13 against Khaleda, her younger son Arafat Rahman Coco, Nizami and 21 others in the GATCO case. Other accused in the case included former ministers M Saifur Rahman, Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, MK Anwar, M Shamsul Islam and Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury. Apart from Khaleda and Coco, Mosharraf Hossain, Mannan Bhuiyan, MK Anwar and M Shamsul Islam are behind bars among others. bdnews24.
