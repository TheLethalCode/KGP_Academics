Only a leg of the bomber remained, lying on the ground. "It was an attack next to be Babur gardens," said Interior Ministry spokesman Zemarai Bashari. "The suicide bomber wanted to get into the (centre of the) city, but there was a strong security checkpoint of the police so he was not able to infiltrate. "He jumped out of the car and detonated himself, as a result of that, fortunately, we do not have a big number of casualties. Only three people are injured, civilians," he said.
