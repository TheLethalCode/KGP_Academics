 Dhaka, July 22 (bdnews24.com)The Dhaka Stock Exchange ended lower Tuesday with investors taking to the streets in the wake of falling prices. DSE indices fell for the seventh straight trading day of the bearish sixth week due to huge sell-offs by panicky investors. A group of retail investors took to the streets at about 11 am when the market started to slump after opening upbeat and staged demonstration in front of the DSE. Afterwards, a delegation of the protestors met the bourse's top official and told him not to go for frequent decision changes. DSE senior vice president Saiful Islam in an instant press briefing said 'external forces' were behind Tuesday's agitation. "We believe that external forces worked behind today's demonstration." He told investors not to panic as ups and downs in the market were quite natural. DSE chief executive Salahuddin Ahmed echoed Saiful and said that the correction was temporary. "There will be risks as it is the nature of the capital market. The Bangladeshi market did not fall that much compared to the recent falls in bourses of India and Pakistan," he told the press. Replying to queries from reporters, he said they thought the Securities and Exchange Commission was "riding the right way". The benchmark DGEN or general index opened upbeat but slumped afterwards losing 45.82 points or 1.63 percent to end on 2764.53.

The CSE-30 blue- chip lost 122.96 points, or 1.58 percent, to end on 7635.25.
