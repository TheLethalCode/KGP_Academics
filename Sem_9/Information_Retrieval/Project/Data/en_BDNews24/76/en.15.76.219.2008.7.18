BDR had earlier reported that Indian border guards gunned down two of their men on the Raghunathpur border in Chapainawabganj in the early hours of Friday. The dead were identified as habildar Abdul Hannan Sarakar, 55, of Bogura and lance naik Krishnapada Saha, 28, of Magura. The incident coincided with a two-day foreign secretary-level meeting between Bangladesh and India in New Delhi, which started Thursday. Bangladesh Rifles also condemned and protested the incident, at a press conference at BDR headquarters in Peelkhana, in which BDR director (operations and training) Col Md Abdul Halim replied to questions from the media. Col Abdul Halim said: "We have learnt from local sources that at least one BSF member was also killed in the incident, and the BSF casualties might be more than one." "Bangladesh believes in maintaining friendly relations with neighbouring countries. This incident would not have taken place if BSF showed restraint like BDR. We strongly condemn and protest this incident." Asked whether the incident was created to put pressure on Bangladesh during the ongoing foreign secretary talks, that discussed border security and Indian transit among other issues, the BDR official replied: "There would be no benefit by doing such things. It may be coincidental. I personally think it has no link with the transit issue." Senior officials from BDR and BSF held a flag meeting Friday afternoon at BDR 39 Battalion headquarters, with BDR Rajshahi sector commander Col Mohammad Iqbal leading the Bangladesh side. Lieutenant colonel Golam Kibria Md Neyamat Ullah, commander of BDR 39 Battalion, had told bdnews24.com Friday morning that a group from the Indian Border Security Force entered about 1300 yards into Bangladesh territory in Durlavpur union, shortly after Thursday midnight. On a tip, Abdul Hannan Sarkar along with a BDR team rushed to the area and challenged the BSF members. but the Indian border guards opened fire on them killing the two BDR men at the scene, said Golam Kibria. The foreign adviser told bdnews24.com "We are awaiting a full report and will react more appropriately when we are made aware of the facts,". "For now, we pray for the salvation of the souls of the two brave Bangladeshis who have been killed," said the adviser. "Our condolences and sympathy are due to the families of the bereaved." When asked how and when the probe report would reach him, Iftekhar said the home ministry would carry out the investigation and report to the foreign ministry, but he did not give any timeframe. When asked whether the incident would affect the outcome of the foreign secretary meeting in New Delhi, the foreign adviser said: "It would not be appropriate to comment at this time." Bangladesh foreign secretary Md Touhid Hossain, before departing for Delhi to meet his Indian counterpart, said on Wednesday that the shootings of BDR personnel by BSF in 'border skirmishes' would be one of the issues at the talks. bdnews24.com/cor
