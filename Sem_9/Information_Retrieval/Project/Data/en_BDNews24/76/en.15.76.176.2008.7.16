 Dhaka, July 16 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court has ordered Jubo League general secretary Mirza Azam to jail on his surrender in a case involving amassing illegal wealth and concealing wealth-related information. Dhaka metropolitan senior judge Md Azizul Haque rejected Mirza's plea for bail after the Jubo League leader surrendered to the court Wednesday. The judge ordered him to be detained, asking prison authorities to give the Jubo league leader division in jail. In the bail petition, Mirza's lawyer Khandaker Abdul Mannan pointed out that charges should have been pressed within 60 days of filing the case, according to legal procedure. But the chargesheet in this case was submitted after a lapse of 179 days invalidating the charges pressed, the lawyer said. Azam surrendered to the High Court on July 14, appealing for bail, but was ordered to surrender to the lower court within 10 days. The Anticorruption Commission filed the graft case against the Jubo League leader on Jan 10, with Ramna Police Station. Charges were pressed against him of concealing information on assets of Tk 34 lakh and amassing Tk 53 lakh in illicit earnings. bdnews24.
