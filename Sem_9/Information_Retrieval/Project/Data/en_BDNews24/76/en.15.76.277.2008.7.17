 Dhaka, July 17 (bdnews24.com)  The central bank Thursday announced its monetary policy for six months from July, which promises to ensure "reasonable price stability" and provide support to "sustainable and high output growth". In the Monetary Policy Statement, the central bank said Bangladesh started fiscal 2009 under mixed developments on both domestic and external fronts. "The domestic economy, despite its enough potential, operates below its capacity which needs to be realised to achieve short-term stability and brighten long-term growth prospects," Bangladesh Bank said. "The unfolding events in the global economy are creating renewed pressures and the global outlook is changing fast in the backdrop of growing liquidity crunch and rising oil and other commodity prices." Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed declined to name the policy in specific terms but said it was certainly not a tight monetary policy. "While monetary tightening can bring down inflation, it has unacceptably high cost in terms of foregone output and employment," the central bank said. According to BB, Bangladesh cannot afford a tight monetary policy "at present in view of its growth and poverty reduction imperatives". However, the central bank said it would not downplay the importance of avoiding "excessive monetary laxity which would harm macroeconomic stability". "For supporting growth promoting policies, the policy stance would give priority to unhindered flow of private sector credit to the economy's productive sectors." The central bank billed agriculture, SMEs, and the rural economy as the prime targets of credit flows. Bangladesh Bank said it would also undertake effective measures to encourage increased flow of credit to women entrepreneurs. The central bank emphasised that special importance would be attached to channelling credit to its "intended productive and supply augmenting uses", besides discouraging credit flows to non-essential unproductive and speculative uses. "To this end, measures such as imposition of higher capital charge in the form of higher general provision requirement on such loans may be considered." bdnews
