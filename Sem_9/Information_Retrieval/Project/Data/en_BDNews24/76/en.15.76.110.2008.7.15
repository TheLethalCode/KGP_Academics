 KABUL, July 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghanistan has suspended a series of meetings with Pakistan because of what it called the "violent policies" of the Pakistani army and intelligence agencies and their suspected involvement in a string of attacks. Pakistan said the accusations were "baseless" and had created an "artificial crisis" that would sour bilateral relations. Afghanistan and Pakistan are important U.S. allies but their relations, for decades dogged by a dispute over their border, have more recently been plagued by Afghan accusations of Pakistani involvement in violence in Afghanistan. Afghan President Hamid Karzai said on Monday Pakistani agents were behind recent violence, including a suicide car bomb attack on the Indian Embassy in Kabul last week that killed 58 people. India's national security adviser said last week he had no doubt Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency was behind the attack. After a cabinet meeting on Monday, Karzai's government issued a statement that Afghanistan would maintain people-to-people contacts and support the newly elected Pakistani government. "(But) it feels compelled in the face of the violent policies of Pakistani army and intelligence agencies, and for the sake of its national sovereignty, to suspend its bilateral and multilateral meetings," the cabinet said in a statement issued late on Monday. Afghanistan was pulling out of meetings on border cooperation and bilateral and regional economic cooperation, all scheduled for coming weeks, it said, adding participation would be suspended "until a positive spirit of dialogue and understanding for mutual trust is restored". The Pakistani Foreign Ministry issued a rejoinder. "Pakistan hopes that Afghanistan will do some rethinking and desist from such provocative statements and initiation of blame game," the statement said. SUSPICION Karzai warned last month he might send troops into Pakistan to fight the Taliban and he told reporters on Monday Afghanistan would soon take revenge for the death and destruction. Pakistan backed the Taliban through the 1990s but cut support after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. More than 1,000 Pakistani soldiers have been killed trying to dislodge al Qaeda and Taliban fighters from tribal lands bordering Afghanistan. The militants have carried out many bomb attacks on Pakistani security forces, including the ISI. Despite that, Pakistan has never been able to dispel suspicion that it is at least turning a blind eye to help going to the Taliban in Afghanistan. Afghanistan believes Pakistan helps the Taliban to counter growing Indian influence, keep the country weak and allow Pakistani forces to concentrate on defending the Indian border. The Afghan cabinet said its expectation that Pakistan's new civilian government would rein in the security agencies had not materialised. It was now up to the Pakistani government to show their good faith, Karzai's spokesman said. "We have all the proof that links the attacks we have mentioned to the Pakistani military and its intelligence agencies," said presidential spokesman Humayun Hamidzada. "These are not documents and proof we are going to discuss in the media, they are going to be available in discussions with our Pakistani counterparts should they wish to show their goodwill and desire to address the questions and problems we face bilaterally, through discussion and mutual cooperation," he said. While accusing the ISI of involvement in the embassy attack, India has not escalated its anger to a point that jeopardises a 4-1/2-year-old peace process with Pakistan. India stopped a delegation from its Central Bureau of Investigation from going to Islamabad for talks due to have begun on Tuesday with Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency, an Indian official said. But, the nuclear-armed neighbours were due to begin a new round of peace talks in New Delhi on July 21, and to hold a meeting in Islamabad on July 18 on enhancing transport links.
