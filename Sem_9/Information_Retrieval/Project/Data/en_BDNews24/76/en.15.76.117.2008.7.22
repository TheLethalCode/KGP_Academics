 Dhaka, July 22 (bdnews24.com) - Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed said Tuesday the next election would be considered a yardstick for the future. "We want this election not only to be free, fair, neutral and acceptable, but also to stand out as a yardstick for future. Such an election will be possible as the voter list has been prepared with photographs," said Fakhruddin. Speaking as chief guest at the closing ceremony of the Voter Registration Programme, the CA repeated that the national elections would be held in December. Mentioning that the credit of registering 8.05 crore voters goes to the people, the chief adviser said: "Today is a memorable day for the nation, a day of celebration." "I don't know whether any other country could register more than 8 crore voters in so short a time. The computerised voter registration is a milestone on the way to holding a free, fair and neutral election." Fakhruddin thanked the Election Commission, Bangladesh Army, donor countries and agencies, government and nongovernmental organisations for "extending financial and technical support and cooperation" at the field level in voter registration. Fakhruddin said the EC was going ahead with holding the local election and Jatiya Sangsad elections as per the roadmap. He hoped the EC would complete printing the voter list in October and hold upazila elections. The CA also hoped that the EC would hold the national election in December. In his address of welcome at the function, chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said: "I express gratitude to the political parties, government and non-governmental agencies, efficient work force and the Bangladesh Army and the UNDP for their cooperation in this historic achievement." "By registering voters with photographs, Bangladesh has entered a glorious phase. It has empowered the voters." As per the roadmap, the voter list will be printed by October. The voter list will be updated by the middle of next year with the help of an automated system in Dhaka, districts and upazilas. Army chief Moeen U Ahmed speaking as special guest urged voters: "Elect honest, efficient and capable people in future. Bangladesh will become a prosperous country by 2020." General Moeen was confident about a free, fair and neutral and credible election by December 2008, and said: "A voter list with photographs is a must for an acceptable election. This time there are 8.05 crore voters on the list." The last list had 9.30 crore voters. "It shows how many fake voters were there on the previous list. If elections had been held on that list, people would have questioned its credibility." bdnews
