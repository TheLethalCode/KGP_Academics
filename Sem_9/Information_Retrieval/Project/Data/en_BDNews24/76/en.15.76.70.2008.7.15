 Dhaka, July 15 (bdnews24.com)A case has been filed against Progressive Democratic Party chief Ferdaus Ahmed Quarishi on charges of attempting to grab a house and making death threats. Asma Lupina Mallick, wife of the late journalist Golam Rasul Mallick Tuesday, filed the case with the Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court accusing Quarishi of trespassing into her Topkhana Road house in an attempt to capture it. Contacted, Quarishi termed the allegation of trespassing baseless and told bdnews24.com that he would file a libel suit. Metropolitan magistrate Maqsuda Parveen ordered the officer-in-charge of Shahbag Police Station to investigate the case and submit a report to the court on Sept 25, the next date of hearing. The plaintiff in her statement said that as heirs of her husband, she and her children were in possession of the six-storey building on Topkhana Road. Asma mentioned that Quarishi had been her tenant. Asma alleged that up to 40 unidentified armed men led by Quarishi illegally entered the fourth floor of the building and ransacked and threw out furniture on July 9. It was also alleged that the "criminals" led by Quarishi looted goods, including computers, worth about Tk 5 lakh. The plaintiff alleged that Quarishi had not been paying house rents for long. Asma alleged that Quarishi forced tenants Nusrat Mahmud Sabuj, news editor, Jainal Abedin, a reporter, of Bangla-language daily Karotoa out of the house and directed his associates to lock the house. Asma told bdnews24.com, "I'm feeling insecure. The accused person has, at different times, issued us death threats." She said that when she first went to file a case with Shahbagh police, they did not record it. Later on July 10, the plaintiff filed a general diary with the police station. Asked about the case, Quarishi told bdnews24.com: "The question of trespass doesn't arise at all as we are in the house. Maybe somebody is using them to blemish my honour." "I will file a Tk 20 crore libel suit." Quarishi also claimed he had once made an advance payment to buy the house. "When Golam Rasul Mallick was alive, I signed an agreement with him to buy the house. Accordingly, I also gave him some money. But later I came to know that the house had become bank property for non-payment of overdue bank loans." "Due to the complexity, I did not get the house registered." Quarishi claimed to be the legal owner of the house. bdnews24
