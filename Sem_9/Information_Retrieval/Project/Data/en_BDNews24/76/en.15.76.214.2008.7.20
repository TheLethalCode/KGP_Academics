 NEW DELHI, July 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The International Cricket Council's (ICC) executive board will decide this week whether or not to shift September's Champions Trophy out of Pakistan because of security issues, the governing body said on Sunday. The decision was taken after concerns raised at an ICC security briefing in Dubai for representatives of the eight participating teams, the international players associations FICA and official broadcasters ESPN STAR Sport. "While there was recognition the PCB (Pakistan Cricket Board) had gone to great lengths to provide a high level of security during the Asia Cup and would do so again during the ICC Champions Trophy, concerns were expressed about the potential for threats beyond the PCB's control," the ICC said in a statement. "These concerns will now be taken to the ICC Board during the course of this week with the Board then arriving at a definitive decision on the location of this year's Champions Trophy. "Until or unless the Board decides otherwise, the tournament will proceed in Pakistan." The tournament is scheduled from Sept. 11-28. Sunday's briefing was provided by ICC's security consultants, who had studied arrangements made for the Asia Cup which ended this month, with the PCB also outlining its security plans.
