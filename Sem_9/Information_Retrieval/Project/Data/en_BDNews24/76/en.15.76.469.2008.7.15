<TEXT>
 BANGALORE, Tue Jul 15,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's main share index fell more than 4 percent on Tuesday to its lowest level in 2008, as fears of further fallout from global credit crisis triggered a sharp sell-off in financials such as ICICI Bank. By 1:58 p.m., the BSE 30-share index was down 4.02 percent, or 536.20 points, at 12,794.31, its lowest in more than 15 months. All its components fell. The benchmark is down nearly 37 percent so far this year, as investors dumped equities on rising inflation, high interest rates, political uncertainty and turmoil in the global financial market. The index had risen 47 percent in 2007, mainly boosted by record inflows of $17.4 billion from overseas funds. Foreigners have been net sellers of nearly $7 billion of Indian equities this year
