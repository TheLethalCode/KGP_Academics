 Dhaka, July 19 (bdnews24.com)Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Saturday urged all to unite in building a prosperous country and said that it was the duty of all to make it happen. "For this, we will have to build strong unity like in 1952 and 1971," the chief adviser in his speech as chief guest at the concluding function of the 50-day road show titled "Esho Desh Gori" at Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre. Agriculture and water resources adviser CS Karim presided over the function, also joined by army chief General Moeen U Ahmed as special guest. Fakhruddin reiterated his pledge to hold national elections in December and said: "A free, fair and neutral election will be held in the county in December. Through it, a reform-oriented democratic government will take over responsibility to run the country." "All of us will have to work so that in future wise, honest, efficient and patriotic people can win in every field. Voting is the highest civic right of people." "I request you to exercise enough consideration and intelligence in voting. You will have to carry on continuous and massive publicity to create public awareness to elect good and efficient leadership." On the road show, the CA said: "This is not publicity in favour of the government or any political party or against anybody. This is the beginning of a spontaneous participation by all irrespective of religion, cast, party or opinion for building the nation." "I strongly believe such programmes will show the civic society an enlightened way to be aware against evil and build up united resistance against evil." The chief adviser said, "Those who are students and youths today are our future. Crime and drug being patronised by the powerful is the biggest impediment to their proper development as good citizens." The CA urged all to come forward actively to resist these crimes. He also directed the law enforcing agencies to take strict action against these crimes. He said that the massive publicity to get Cox's Bazar selected as one of the seven natural wonders was praiseworthy. "We will have to take effective steps to ensure infrastructure, development of tourism facilities, positive publicity and security." The chief adviser said that corruption was eating up a big part of our development, prosperity and good governance potentials. We will have to work united at all levels of society for eliminating corruption. The chief adviser in his speech projected different programmes taken up by his government and successes in agricultural development. He also spoke of the preparations of the election commission for holding the next election. bdnew
