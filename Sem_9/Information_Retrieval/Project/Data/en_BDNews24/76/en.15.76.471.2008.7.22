<TITLE> EC's duty to hold upazila polls, not govt's: LGRD adviser </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 22 (bdnews24.com) - Local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal stressed Tuesday that holding upazila polls was the responsibility of the Election Commission, and the government had nothing to do or gain in the matter. Asked by reporters, at his Secretariat office, whether the government would hold upazila elections despite opposition by political parties, the adviser said: "Earlier it was the local government ministry's responsibility to hold upazila elections, but now it has been transferred to the Election Commission." "The Election Commission will perform its duty," he said. Anwarul added: "The government wants to hold upazila elections because the people said they wanted local government polls, including upazila polls, during regional dialogues." "It would have been better if the political parties had joined those dialogues. They would have come to know people's views," he said. Asked whether the government would take any steps to bring the political parties to the upazila polls, the adviser said: "Upazila polls are local body elections. And local government elections are non-partisan polls." In reply to a question on whether the state of emergency would be withdrawn before the upazila elections, he said: "The chief adviser has repeatedly said that where relaxation is necessary it will be done." bdnew
