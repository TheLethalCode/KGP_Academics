 Chittagong, July 22 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong port authorities are in trouble with the ships coming from India with rice because of a transport crisis and inadequate storage facilities. The twin problems left six ships idle at as many jetties for the last one week. Five more ships loaded with 52,429 tonnes of rice are waiting at outer anchorage. Some 2,000 to 2,500 tonnes of rice are unloaded daily from ships at a jetty, Chittagong Port Authority director (transport) Firoz Ahmed told bdnews24.com Monday. But it was not possible to unload more than 650 tonnes of rice at a time now as the food directorate failed to provide adequate trucks, he said. India had earlier supplied 1 lakh tonne of rice out of 5 lakh tonnes the country pledged to export to Bangladesh. The supply of the remaining 4 lakh tonnes is underway, with 54,000 tonnes reaching Chittagong port in the last one week. "If the Chittagong regional food directorate works so slow ships will have to wait 10 more days," Firoz said. The port authorities in a meeting with food directorate officials had suggested that the regional food director rent local storage facilities to resolve the problems. bdnews
