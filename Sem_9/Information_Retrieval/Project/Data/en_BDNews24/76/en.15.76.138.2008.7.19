 Dhaka, July 19 (bdnews24.com) - Awami League and associated organisations are set to observe a countrywide token hunger strike Saturday to press home its demand for curbing commodity prices. Awami League acting president Zillur Rahman and acting general secretary Mukul Bose in a statement Friday urged party leaders and supporters at all levels to ensure the success of the hunger strike programme. AL's demands also include distribution of more VGF (Vulnerable Group Feeding) cards, introduction of rationing throughout the country and unconditional release of party chief Sheikh Hasina. The programme was announced at a party presidium meeting on July 13, but Saturday's programme has been shortened by two hours. AL spokesperson Ashim Kumar Ukil told bdnews24.com: "A slight change has been made to the mass hunger strike programme. Earlier it was scheduled to be held from 10am to 5pm. But, it is now scheduled to start at 11am and end at 4pm." The programme will be observed at two locations in Dhaka city, he added. "Awami League presidium members, working committee members and advisory council members will participate in the programme at the party president's political office in Dhanmondi," said Ashim. "Dhaka city AL and front organisations will gather at the party's Bangabandhu Avenue office to observe the hunger strike," he said. bdnews
