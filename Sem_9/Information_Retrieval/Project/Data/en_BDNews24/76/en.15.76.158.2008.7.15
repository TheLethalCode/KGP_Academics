 NEW DELHI Tue Jul 15, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Security forces and state-backed militias fighting Maoist rebels in Chhattisgarh have displaced thousands of people since 2005, US-based group Human Rights Watch (HRW) said on Tuesday. The groups and security forces have raped villagers and burned down homes of those who did not join the militia against Maoists, the group said in a report, urging India to end support for the movement. In Chhattisgarh, state authorities have since 2005 funded and armed an anti-Maoist movement made up of poor tribal people, including children, known as the Salwa Judum or Campaign for Peace. The Indian government says the Salwa Judum is a spontaneous self-defence movement of villagers. Human Rights Watch says the militia in Chhattisgarh is effectively state-run. "The Chhattisgarh government denies supporting Salwa Judum, but dozens of eyewitnesses have described police participating in violent Salwa Judum raids on villages, killing, looting and burning their hamlets," said Jo Becker, advocacy director at HRW. The Maoists have also retaliated by bombing villages and abducted and executed Salwa Judum sympathisers, HRW says in its report, "Being Neutral Is Our Biggest Crime." Around 1,100 people have been killed in clashes between security forces and Maoists in Chhattisgarh since 2004, according to state government. The Maoist movement began four decades ago in the eastern state of West Bengal, and claims to fight for the rights of poor farmers and landless labourers. The movement has spread to at least 13 of India's 29 states but Chhattisgarh is considered one of the worst hit. They regularly use landmines and grenades to attack vehicles of security forces, power lines, government buildings, rail lines and factories, aiming to cripple economic activity. But innocent villagers have mostly been caught in the crossfire. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said last year the Maoist revolt was the biggest internal security challenge facing India since independence in 1947. In March this year, India's Supreme Court condemned the militia movement, and said the state would be abetting a crime if the group's members killed innocent bystanders
