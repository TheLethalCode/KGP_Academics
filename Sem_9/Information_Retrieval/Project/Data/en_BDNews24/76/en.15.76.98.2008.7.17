 VIENNA/DAMASCUS (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said on Thursday big powers were waiting for specific proposals from Iran in new talks over its disputed nuclear work and Iran's foreign minister said U.S. participation was "positive. The United States said on Wednesday it was sending an envoy to Geneva to join nuclear talks with Iran for the first time to underline to the Islamic Republic and others that Washington desired a diplomatic solution to the volatile impasse. "The American participation is positive," Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki told a news conference in Damascus. "We look forward to constructive engagement", he said, referring to a new round of talks in Geneva on Saturday. Kouchner welcomed U.S. participation at the Geneva talks along with British, French, German, Russian and Chinese envoys, aimed at probing for any Iranian flexibility on terms for obtaining trade benefits if it suspends uranium enrichment. "This is not only a good initiative, but our U.S. friends are joining the dialogue. It's a very interesting, a new attitude, an additional asset, no doubt," Kouchner told reporters outside a European security meeting in Vienna. He said Iran's dismissive response so far to a revised packet of incentives offered by the powers if it shelves nuclear activity that could yield atom bombs was "not surprising, a bit sad," but its readiness to discuss it further was encouraging. "We are waiting for an opening. I talked to (Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr) Mottaki and he was open, but open to what? That is always the case. We talk and talk with the Iranians, but it's always disillusion," said Kouchner, speaking in English. He said Tehran was still not addressing "the core of the subject" -- an enrichment suspension, or an interim freeze on steps to expand the proliferation-prone activity, to get preliminary negotiations going. "But they accepted dialogue so let's start dialogue. It's understood the Americans will be very tough (in Geneva). But certainly this (their presence) is an asset," said Kouchner. He spoke to reporters after addressing the 56-nation Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe's Permanent Council in Vienna. BEIJING WELCOMES US MOVE Washington has had no relations with Iran since 1980 and would have the most to offer it in the way of relief from international political and economic sanctions, making U.S. engagement crucial to resolving the standoff, analysts say. In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said his government welcomed the U.S. step and wanted to see more give-and take from all sides. "We also hope that all sides will grasp the current favorable opportunities and step up their efforts, and in particular demonstrate flexibility to advance dialogue and negotiations as early as possible." A British newspaper said on Thursday the United States will announce in the next month that it plans to establish a U.S. interest section in Tehran for the first time in 30 years, "The move will see US diplomats stationed in the country," said the Guardian in a front-page report. The Guardian said the development was "a remarkable turnaround in policy by President George Bush who has pursued a hawkish approach to Iran throughout his time in office". Tensions with Iran have intensified, particularly after Tehran tested missiles last week, pushing up oil prices, rattling Israeli nerves and prompting Washington to say it would defend its allies against any possible attacks. The Bush administration said it was not changing its stance that it will join full-blown negotiations with Iran only if Tehran first shelves enrichment activity. But Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice saw it as a "smart step" to depart from usual policy and send senior diplomat William Burns to Geneva on Saturday for talks with Iran along with other major powers, said her spokesman Sean McCormack. Burns will join EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana and officials from the other five powers to elicit a more detailed Iranian response to the enhanced offer of financial and diplomatic incentives to halt its secretive nuclear campaign. Iran says its nuclear work is for peaceful power generation, not nuclear bombs as Western leaders suspect. and has rejected conditions it give up uranium enrichment.
