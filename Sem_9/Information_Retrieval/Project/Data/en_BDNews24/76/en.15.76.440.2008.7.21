<TITLE> Malaysia's police chief sues Anwar for defamation </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KUALA LUMPUR, Mon Jul 21,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Malaysia's police chief is suing opposition figure Anwar Ibrahim for defamation over allegations the chief concocted evidence against Anwar in an assault case, the policeman's lawyer said on Monday. Anwar had said police chief Musa Hassan fabricated evidence against him when he caused a doctor to produce a report stating that Anwar's injuries, sustained while in police custody in 1998, could have been self-inflicted or accidental when the policeman knew he had been beaten up, Musa's lawyer said. "These words that he uttered are untrue and false and defamatory of Musa," Kamarul Hisham Kamaruddin said, adding that the police chief has asked for an unspecified amount of damages. Anwar, a former deputy premier, sustained injuries while in police custody a decade ago after he was sacked and arrested for sodomy and corruption. His old injuries are back in the spotlight as the de facto opposition leader fights fresh allegations that he sodomised a former aide. Anwar says he is the victim of a high-level conspiracy to thwart the opposition's rise. The police have freed Anwar on bail and have not pressed sodomy charges against him. Sodomy, even between consenting adults, is punishable by up to 20 years in prison in mainly Muslim Malaysia. Anwar said he would fight the suit in court, while repeating his assertion that the opposition was on track to take over the government. "There is a pattern here to demonise me," he told reporters. "Clearly I am seen as a political threat because (opposition alliance) Pakatan Rakyat has a plan and is continuing with the plan. We want to pursue this agenda for reform and I believe that we can proceed and we will make the necessary announcement very soon." He did not elaborate. Anwar has said he has won enough support to form a new government by September. His opposition alliance has capitalised on public discontent with rising prices and a series of political scandals involving the government to gain ground on the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition. But some analysts have said the sodomy allegation plaguing Anwar could scuttle the opposition's plans to take power. The opposition alliance recorded its best ever result in a March poll, when it wrested control of five states and denied the ruling coalition its two-thirds parliamentary majority. The father of Anwar's accuser urged Anwar on Monday to cooperate with police investigating the case. "My son Saiful Bukhari has said that he is ready and willing at any time to swear in accordance with Islamic teachings at a mosque and to be witnessed by ulamas (religious scholars) and to uphold the truth that he was sodomised according to what was reported to the police," Azlan Mohd Lazim said in a statement read by Saiful's lawyer
