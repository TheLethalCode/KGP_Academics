 Jessore, July 19 (bdnews24.com)The BSF shot dead two Bangladeshis on Chougachha border in Jessore Saturday, a day after two BDR members were killed by Indian border guards. The dead have been identified as Rezaul Islam, 32, and Zainal Abedin, 35, of Sukh Pukuria village under Chougachha. BDR Jadavpur company commander Mosharraf Hossain alleged that the BSF had killed the two Bangladeshi youths without any "provocation". "Rezaul Islam and Zainal Abedin were near the barbed wire fencing in Panchpirtala border area around 5am, Hossain said. "At the time, BSF members from Moshrumpur border opened fire on them." Rezaul and Zainal collapsed in a hail of bullets and died on the spot, the BDR officer said. The patrolling BDR members hearing the gunshots retaliated with rounds of blank fire. BSF dragged the bodies into the Indian territory, the BDR officer said. Indian border guards gunned down two BDR men on the Raghunathpur border in Chapainawabganj early Friday, which coincided with a two-day foreign secretary-level meeting between Bangladesh and India in New Delhi. Following the incident, the BDR and BSF members held a flag meeting, where Bangladesh border guards pressed for a probe into the killings of the BDR officers. bdnews2
