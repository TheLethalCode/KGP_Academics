 Panchagarh, July 21 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission chief Monday vowed to ratchet up activities to fight corruption after withdrawal of the state of emergency. "The anti-graft drive was not designed on the basis of the state of emergency. The ACC will go tougher on graft after the emergency is withdrawn," ACC chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury told reporters in Panchagarh after a meeting with government officials on institutionalised efforts to curb corruption. The ACC chief also said the activities of national anticorruption taskforces might slow due to withdrawal of the emergency. Chowdhury underscored the need for growing moral consciousness among government employees against corruption. The ACC chief became angry after magistrate Moshiur Rahman, attached with the Deputy Commissioner's Office, called for a pay rise for government employees at the meeting. Chowdhury reprimanded the magistrate for his demand and said that more wages might not erase corruption from society. "Graft cannot be decriminalised on an excuse of low salary," said the former army chief. "I don't believe people will stay away from corruption if their salaries are raised." The ACC chairman said corruption could not be rooted out but could be brought down to a tolerable level. "If abuse of power and exchange of bribe can be stopped, corruption will be nearly gone," he observed. Pointing to a recent report of the Transparency International Bangladesh, the ACC chief said government officials were directly involved with graft. The ACC told reporters that the ACC was currently dealing with 1,272 cases. Of them, the ACC itself filed 500 cases. bdnews2
