 MADRID, July 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two explosive devices went off in seaside resorts in Cantabria, northern Spain, after a warning telephone call on Sunday that said the devices had been planted by Basque separatists ETA, government officials said. The first device exploded on a seafront walkway in Laredo at about 5:40 a.m. EDT causing minor damage. The second went off 7:00 a.m. EDT in Noja, exploding in sand dunes. There were no casualties from either blast as both areas had been cleared as a result of the warning call, government officials said. Emergency authorities received a call telling them ETA had planted four bombs on the beaches of Laredo, Noja and Noja's golf course and that they would explode between 6:00 a.m. EDT and 9:00 a.m. EDT on Sunday, said a government official. ETA (Euskadi ta Askatasuna, or Basque Country and Freedom) is fighting for an independent Basque state in northern Spain and southwestern France. The group, listed as a terrorist organization by Spain, the United States and the European Union, has killed more than 800 people since 1968, typically with car bombs or shootings. More than 750 suspected ETA members have been detained since 2000.
