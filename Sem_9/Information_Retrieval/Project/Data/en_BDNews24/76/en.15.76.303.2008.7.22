<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 22 (bdnews24.com)Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said Monday the multilateral trading system would create a fair-play ground for all trading partners and bring benefit to the global trading system. In his statement at the WTO Mini-Ministerial Meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, Rahman said the LDCs want better market access for products and service providers. "This is very much along with the spirit of the WTO principles. We expect positive initiatives from our trading partners, who are fortunately enough to be economically developed than us." "I strongly believe that much more flexibility needs to be shown by the members in the areas where the divergence remain," he said. On the issue of DFQF (duty-free quota-free) market access for LDCs, Rahman said ministers in Hong Kong made it clear that duty-free quota-free market access will be provided for all products from all LDCs. "The issue of Rules of Origin is crucial for us. Duty-free quota-free market access without simplifying the preferential Rules of Origin will not bring any benefit to LDC exporters." On capacity building, Bangladesh's commerce adviser welcomed the reference of mechanism like enhanced integrated framework for LDC and Aid for Trade by the WTO chairman. On non-reciprocal preference, Rahman said: "We welcome the increase in the list of products in annex 2 and 3. The LDC Group has also noted that you have proposed one year of grace period before the tariff reduction starts." Rahman said the LDC Group reiterates its commitment to multilateral trade. bd
