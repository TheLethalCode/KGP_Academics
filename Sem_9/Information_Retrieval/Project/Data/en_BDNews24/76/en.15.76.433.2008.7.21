 SHANNON, Mon Jul 21, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said on Monday she would make clear in her first meeting with North Korea this week it must meet its obligations and answer lingering questions about its nuclear program. Rice meets North Korea's Foreign Minister Pak Ui-chun for the first time on the sidelines of a Southeast Asian-sponsored forum in Singapore on Wednesday, along with ministers from China, Japan, South Korea and Russia, the other parties involved in nuclear arms talks with Pyongyang. Former US Secretary of State Colin Powell was the last top US diplomat to meet the North Korean foreign minister, in July 2004, but Rice has held back on such a meeting until now. "I believe there will be a very strong message that the obligations need to be met and that the verification protocol really needs to be completed and that it has to be a verification protocol that can give us confidence that we are able to verify the accuracy of the North Korean declaration," Rice told reporters before a refueling stop in Ireland. "There is progress being made but there are more steps to take," she added. In late June, the North presented a long-delayed account of its nuclear developments which contained information on its plutonium production, but did little to address US suspicions of a secret uranium enrichment program. Rice stressed that North Korea must address "all nuclear programs, including highly-enriched uranium". North Korea has denied US accusations of having a clandestine program to enrich uranium, a process that could offer a second path to material for nuclear weapons beyond its plutonium project. Nuclear envoys from the six countries held a meeting in Beijing earlier this month at which North Korea was pressed to accept a mechanism or protocol to verify claims it made about its weapons-grade plutonium stockpile. No final agreement was reached on a detailed guideline on how to verify the North's account of its nuclear activities but a working group was mandated to draw up details. bdnews24.com/lq/1646 hrs. North Korea also pledged at those talks to complete steps to disable its nuclear facilities by the end of October in exchange for aid and better diplomatic relations. Rice, due to arrive in Singapore on Tuesday after a one-night stopover in Abu Dhabi, said Wednesday's meeting was an informal one rather than a negotiating session and another six-party ministerial would be held at a later date. "It is just an opportunity for us to talk. I would not call it either historic, or monumental or even consequential. It is just in the consultation category," she said. "This just seemed like a very good opportunity seeing as we will all be in the same place to have a kind of informal opportunity to talk about what is going on," she added. The ASEAN Regional Forum is the only annual event that brings together the six countries' foreign ministers and draws the rare regular presence of the top diplomat from reclusive North Korea. The delivery of the long-delayed declaration of nuclear activities by North Korea last month led to a start in improved ties between the two countries. Immediately after the declaration, U.S. President George W. Bush began a 45-day process to remove Pyongyang from the list of state sponsors of terrorism. Once it is removed from the U.S. terrorism list, the communist state will see an end to sanctions that have mostly cut it off
