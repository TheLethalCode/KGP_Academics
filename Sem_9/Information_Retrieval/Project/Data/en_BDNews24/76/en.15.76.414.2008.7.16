 Dhaka, July 16 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Wednesday asked world leaders to come forward and help Bangladesh face the effects of climate change. The CA at a meeting in his office told Ole Danbolt Mjs, chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, that Bangladesh was the country worst affected by climate change although it was hardly responsible for global warming. "Due to climate change, we have to change our development strategy. We have got to face climate change in addition to fighting poverty. We need a large amount of money to cope with climate change," the CA was quoted as saying by his deputy press secretary Sarwar Alam. He said one-third of Bangladesh land would go under water due to sea level rise being caused by global warming. "Besides, tidal swells from India and Nepal flow through Bangladesh causing floods," he added. Mjs said that climate change jeopardised the process of establishing peace and cutting down poverty. He stressed working for the grassroots people to establish peace. bdnews
