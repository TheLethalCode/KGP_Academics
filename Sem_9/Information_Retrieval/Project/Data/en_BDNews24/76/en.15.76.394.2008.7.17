<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 17 (bdnews24.com)  Chief Election Commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda voiced concern on Thursday over criminals returning to their 'stamping grounds' to muscle in on local elections. Huda called on law enforcers to act on recent media reports and prevent known criminals from returning to their home grounds ahead of the upcoming city and municipal polls. "People are concerned as these criminals are returning to their areas ahead of elections. Law enforcers must act to arrest and recover their illegal arms," he told a meeting to review law and order in the electoral constituencies, held at the National Economic Council (NEC) auditorium. The CEC told reporters after the meeting: "To ensure law and order during the elections known criminals will be targeted, taken into custody and illegal arms will be recovered prior to the polls." Huda added that the government is not thinking of deploying armed forces to maintain law and order during the upcoming city and municipal polls. Admitting that at least half of the 13 election zones have markedly risky polling centres, the CEC said: "At those centres identified as risky, law enforcers will maintain a three-tier vigilance operationthe first tier will be at the centre, the second tier will consist of mobile teams and the third will be a striking force for tackling any kind of adversity." The CEC asked all concerned officials in Thursday's meeting to remain impartial from the time of casting votes to the end of vote counting. Huda termed the local government polls a 'test case'. "If we can hold the city and municipality polls properly it will make a positive impact on upazila and national elections," he told the meeting. He added that the electoral code of conduct had been maintained well so far. "But it's only two days since the state of emergency was relaxed. We have to proceed cautiously on whether the rules are being obeyed properly." Huda had said earlier that the meeting on law and order would discuss five main issues including informing electoral officials of electoral rules and regulations, proper implementation of electoral rules and regulations, recovering illegal arms, arresting known criminals and constraining their activities and movements and deployment of law enforcers. "This time the election officials have been vested with huge powers on voting day. They can arrest anybody who hinders the elections." "Everybody should heed the electoral laws." Among others who attended the meeting were election commissioners Muhammad Sohul Hussain and M Sakhawat Hussain, EC secretary Muhammad Humayun Kabir, deputy commissioners of the 13 constituencies and law enforcers. bdnews24.com/mhc
