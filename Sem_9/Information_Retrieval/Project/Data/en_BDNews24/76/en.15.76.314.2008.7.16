 Dhaka, July 16 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has warned Rajshahi mayoral candidate AHM Khairuzzaman Liton against holding any rally in front of the city's Awami League office, a senior election official said Wednesday. Syed Mohammad Musa, returning officer for Rajshahi city polls, told bdnews24.com that Liton was given the warning after the EC sent a letter regarding the AL leader's election campaign. "The city corporation election is a non-partisan election. Reports on televisions and newspapers often show that Rajshahi city mayor candidate AHM Khairuzzaman Liton addresses rallies in front of a political party's office. The matter has drawn the attention of the Election Commission. Such action amounts to violation of election rules," the letter to the returning officer said. The commission also sent the letter to Rajshahi divisional commissioner, police commissioner, deputy commissioner and the superintendent of police. Musa said Liton assured him that he would not further violate election rules. The EC also warned other local polls candidates who had reportedly violated rules and regulations. The commission has formed a three-member vigilance and observation team, a four-member monitoring team and a five-member cell for law enforcement in each polling area to ensure that electoral rules and regulations are followed properly. The chief election commissioner is scheduled to hold a meeting Thursday with senior government officials and representatives from different law enforcement agencies to discuss how the city and municipality polls can be held in a free and fair manner. bdnews
