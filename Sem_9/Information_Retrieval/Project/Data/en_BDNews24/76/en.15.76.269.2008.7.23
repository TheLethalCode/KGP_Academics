<TITLE> Graft cases alone will not stem corruption: ACC boss </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Naogaon, July 23 (bdnews24.com)  Anticorruption Commission chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury said Wednesday that it was not possible to drive out graft just by filing corruption cases or holding public meetings. "No outer force or quarter will come to help us drive out corruption, we have to be free of corruption through our own sense of refinement or patriotism," the ACC chief told a meeting of government officials in Naogaon. "We have to take the responsibility on our own to build a corrupt free nation," Chowdhury said at the meeting on institutionalised efforts to curb corruption. "Government officials should have a sense of accountability to this end." The ACC boss said it was not to be expected that graft could be wiped out overnight. "People must avoid corruption by complying with religious practices, thinking of the future of their children and above all correcting themselves by being concerned about the country," the ACC boss said. bdnews24.co
