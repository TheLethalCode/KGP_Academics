 Dhaka, July 20 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Sunday granted anticipatory bail to Awami League presidium members Tofail Ahmed and Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury in separate graft cases. A HC bench of justices Sharif Uddin Chaklader and Imdadul Haque Azad issued the order, which will remain effective until the submission of investigation reports. The Anticorruption Commission filed a case against Tofail on May 29, on charges of acquiring wealth beyond known sources of income. The graft watchdog also filed a similar case against Sajeda on July 10. Barrister Shafique Ahmed represented the two AL leaders in the bail hearing, while advocate Abdul Aziz Khan represented the ACC. bdnews24
