<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 20 (bdnews24.com)A High Court judge said Sunday he felt too embarrassed to hear a writ petition by Jamaat-e-Islami chief Motiur Rahman Nizami who challenged the legality of the GATCO scam case. A bench forwarded the petition and related documents to the chief justice after one of the two judges on the benchjustices Khademul Islam Chowdhury and Mashuk Hossain Ahmedexpressed "embarrassment". Nizami filed the petition with the bench Thursday seeking freezes on the proceedings of the case. The Jamaat chief also appealed to the court to issue a ruling asking the government to explain why the case and its proceeding would not be declared illegal. Barrister Abdur Razzak defended Nizami in court. The Jamaat chief, who was arrested on May 18 in the GATCO scam case, was released on July 15 on bail. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case with Tejgaon police on Sept 2 last year against 13 people including Khaleda, her son Arafat Rahman Coco and Nizami, for awarding Global Agro Trade Company a cargo-handling deal through misuse of power. On July 15, the HC stayed the trial of the case in Dhaka Special Judge's Court-3, for two months, on a writ petition filed by Khaleda to challenge the legality of the case and its proceedings. bdnew
