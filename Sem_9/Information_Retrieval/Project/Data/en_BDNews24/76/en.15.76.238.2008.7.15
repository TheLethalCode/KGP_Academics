 Dhaka, July 15 (bdnews24.com)The Association of Private Universities of Bangladesh (APUB), in a stand against further regulation of its sector, demanded on Tuesday that the government scrap the proposed Private University Ordinance 2008. Acting chairman of APUB, Abul Kashem Haider addressing a press conference at the Dhaka Reporters Unity auditorium, said: "The law passed in 1992 for regulating private universities should be the one in force." Private universities emerged in the country to offer better academic choice and openings, as public universitiesenmeshed in innumerable regulationsfailed to provide opportunities for innovative education and research, Haider said. He said higher education would again be sunk into a quagmire of red-tape if the government attempted "to regulate every move of the private universities through the proposed ordinance". In the name of updating the Private University Act 1992, its mainstay chapters, sections and articles are being replaced with stronger regulatory tools, Haider said, which cannot be hailed as anything beneficial. Concerned that the proposed law would affect the country's higher education sector adversely, Haider said the proposed ordinance should be scrapped immediately. Certain changes incorporated in the proposed ordinance would alter the fundamental policies and structure of the private universities, weakening their operations, he said. The association's acting chairman said private universities accommodated 124,000 students in 2007, offering diverse courses at less expense compared with public universities, which had reduced pressure on the public exchequer. bdnews24/
