 ISLAMABAD, July 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Pakistan military rejected on Thursday U.S. media reports that an American air strike which killed 11 Pakistani soldiers happened because the U.S. military did not know their post on the Afghan border was there. U.S. officials, who spoke to some media on condition of anonymity, said the preliminary results of a joint U.S.-Pakistani investigation into the June 10 incident showed they did not have the location of the soldiers' post in the Mohmand tribal region. U.S. coalition ground forces in Afghanistan called in air support after coming under fire from positions on a ridge overlooking the border. Around eight militants were killed in the air strike, but it also hit the border post manned by Pakistani paramilitary troops. Pakistan's military spokesman Major General Athar Abbas said the information on the post's location had been shared with the U.S. military. "We had shared with them everything, including grid coordinates of all the posts on our side, and even handed over to them marked maps, indicating the location of our posts," he said. "I would say these reports are simply devoid of facts." Abbas said both sides would have to provide consent before the inquiry's findings could be made public.
