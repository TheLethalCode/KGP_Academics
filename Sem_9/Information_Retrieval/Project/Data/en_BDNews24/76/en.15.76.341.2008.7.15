<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 15 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Tuesday ordered a two-month stay on the trial court proceedings of the GATCO graft case filed against former prime minister Khaleda Zia and others. The court also issued a rule nisi on the government and the Anticorruption Commission, asking them to explain within four weeks why filing and proceedings of the case should not be declared illegal. A HC bench of justices Khademul Islam Chowdhury and Mashuk Hossain Ahmed gave the ruling on a writ petition filed by the former prime minister on July 10 challenging the legality of the case. After the ruling Khaleda's lawyer Rafiq-ul-Huq told reporters that the court stayed the case proceedings as the ACC had not acted in line with legal procedure in approving the case and pressing charges. Lawyer for the ACC, Khurshid Alam Khan said, however, that the ACC had approved the case after properly examining all the documents related to the case. All the ACC actions were in line with the law, he said. The ACC would file an appeal with the Supreme Court Appellate Division against the HC stay order, the lawyer said. The former prime minister had submitted a previous writ petition to the HC, on Sept 27 last year, challenging the transfer of the GATCO case under emergency powers rules. The HC stayed the proceedings against Khaleda on Sept 30, and granted her bail. On Oct 4, the Appellate Division put a halt on the HC ruling for three weeks. The ACC later appealed to extend the period so trial proceedings could continue. The antigraft body filed the case against Khaleda Zia, son Arafat Rahman Coco and 11 others on Sept 2 last year, on charges of awarding Global Agro Trade Company a cargo-handling deal through misuse of power. The commission later pressed charges against a total of 25 people, on May 13 this year. Joint forces arrested Khaleda and Coco as accused in the GATCO case on Sept 3 last year. The case was brought under emergency powers rules on Sept 18. bdnew
