 Dhaka, July 19 (bdnews24.com)  Former prime minister Khaleda Zia's younger son Arafat Rahman Coco is being taken to Thailand Saturday for better medical treatment. Coco and four others will leave Dhaka by Thai Airways shortly after 1pm, Khaleda Zia's lawyer advocate Shamsur Rahman Shimul Biswas told bdnews24.com. He will take treatment at Bumrungrad Hospital in Bangkok. Coco started for Zia International Airport from his Dhaka Cantonment home in an ambulance, Biswas said. Coco's wife Sharmila Rahman Tabassum, daughters Zaika Rahman and Zafia Rahman and brother-in-law Mustakim Reza are accompanying him. The BNP chairperson's son was released from the prison ward of BSMMU Hospital on Thursday, after the government approved eight-week parole for him on medical grounds. He was arrested on Sept 3, 2007 as an accused in the GATCO corruption case. He has also been exempted from court appearance on medical grounds for hearings of the GATCO case. Coco is yet to be exempted in a third case involving extortion charges. bdnew
