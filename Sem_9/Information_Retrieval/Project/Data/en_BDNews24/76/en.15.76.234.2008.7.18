<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 18 (bdnews24.com)  Arafat Rahman Coco is likely to fly to Bangkok Saturday for treatment, a lawyer said Friday. Advocate Shamsur Rahman Shimul Biswas told bdnews24.com that Coco's family were doing all they could to fly him to the Thai capital on Saturday for urgent medical treatment. In the meantime, he was under observation by his private doctors at his Dhaka Cantonment home in Shahid Mainul Road, the lawyer said. Coco was released from the prison ward of BSMMU Hospital on Thursday, on parole for eight weeks, after a medical board formed by the government prescribed overseas treatment for the younger son of former prime minister Khaleda Zia. A Dhaka court also exempted him on Thursday from appearing in hearings of a case filed by the Anticorruption Commission against him. Another family lawyer, Sanaullah Miah had earlier quoted Coco's wife Sharmila Rahman as saying: "Immediately after release [Coco] will be taken to Bangkok for treatment. Steps haves been taken to arrange the necessary funds for this, as bank accounts remain frozen." Coco was arrested on September 3, 2007, along with his mother as an accused in the GATCO corruption case. He has been exempted from for hearings of the GATCO case, but is yet to be exempted in a third case against him involving extortion charges. bdnew
