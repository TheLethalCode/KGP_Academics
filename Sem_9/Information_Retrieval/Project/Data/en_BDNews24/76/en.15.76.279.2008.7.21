 LEEDS, England, July 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa defeated England by 10 wickets in the second test at Headingley on Monday to take a 1-0 lead in the four-match series with a day to spare. England, who made 203 on Friday, were dismissed for 327 in their second innings shortly before the close on the fourth day, leaving South Africa needing only nine runs to win. South Africa's winning performance was dominated by centuries from AB de Villiers (174) and Ashwell Prince (149) as they set up their team's imposing first innings total of 522. De Villiers revealed he was motivated by boos from the crowd and abuse from England players after he claimed a catch on Friday that was shown to have bounced first. Andrew Flintoff, in his first test for 18 months, resisted South Africa's victory charge in an unusually slow innings of 38 from 95 balls before he was caught at second slip off Morne Morkel. The time in the middle should at least be some consolation for him and England. The day started well for England as nightwatchman James Anderson took some painful blows to the body from Dale Steyn while making a test best 34. South Africa attempted to unsettle the stubborn Anderson and in the 45th over Steyn struck him between the arm guard and glove on his facing right arm and he required immediate medical attention to check there was no damage. After a five-minute delay, Steyn bowled Anderson another spiteful short ball that crashed into the grill of his helmet in front of his right cheekbone. FRUSTRATING CAMEO Anderson fell to the ground instantly and an 11-minute delay separated the third and fourth balls to demonstrate the seriousness of the blow. He was eventually trapped lbw in front of middle stump and received a standing ovation for his 111-minute resistance that spanned 80 deliveries. It was Steyn's 50th test wicket of the year. Kevin Pietersen lasted five balls for his 13 in a frustrating cameo. The post-lunch session featured Ian Bell's dismissal when his square cut to a short and wide delivery was brilliantly caught by de Villiers in the gully, clutching the ball one-handed after diving to his right. After an animated celebration he gestured, in good nature, to the crowd who had booed him when he went out to bat on Saturday. Top scorer Alastair Cook was caught off a leading edge by Hashim Amla at cover from the bowling of Jacques Kallis for 60 after batting for almost five hours. Tim Ambrose was caught behind off Steyn for 36 from 94 balls after he abandoned his patient approach. He may be under pressure to retain his place after one half-century in his last nine test innings. Stuart Broad hit an unbeaten 67 at the end of the innings with 11 cleanly struck boundaries. He added 61 for the last wicket with debutant Darren Pattinson (13). South Africa are seeking their first series win in England since their return from international isolation. They last won in 1965
