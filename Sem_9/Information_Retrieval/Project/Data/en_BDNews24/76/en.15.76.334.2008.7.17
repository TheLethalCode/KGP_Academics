 Dhaka, July 17 (bdnews24.com)  All-rounder Shakib Al Hasan has returned to the national fold Thursday as he has been drafted into Bangladesh's preliminary squad for next month's four-nation Twenty20 tournament in Canada and an ODI series in Australia. Middle-order batsman Shakib pulled out of the national team due to his higher secondary examination to miss two series - Asia Cup in Pakistan and tri-nation one-day international series at home  in June-July. The Bangladesh Cricket Board Thursday announced a 21-member preliminary squad for the Twenty20 tournament involving Pakistan, West Indies, Bangladesh and Canada, scheduled for Aug 14-17 in Toronto. Pinning hopes on the old guys, the three-member selection committee headed by Rafiqul Alam also recalled opener Junaed Siddique, keeper Dhiman Ghosh, pacers Syed Rasel, Nazmul Hossain and uncapped Naeem Islam. Aftab Ahmed, who sustained a finger injury ahead of the tri-nation series at home in July, was not considered as he is yet to get fit. Squad: Mohammad Ashraful (captain), Mashrafe Bin Mortaza (vice captain), Tamim Iqbal, Shahriar Nafees, Shakib Al Hasan, Roqibul Hassan, Alok Kapali, Mahmudullah Riyad, Abdur Razzak, Shahadat Hossain, Farhad Reza, Dollar Mahmud, Musharraf Hossain, Mehrab Hossain (Jr.), Nazim Uddin, Mushfiqur Rahim, Syed Rasel, Nazmul Hossain, Naeem Islam, Dhiman Ghosh and Zunaed Siddique.
