 Dhaka, July 18 (bdnews24.com)  Former BNP whip Ashraf Hossain was taken back to Dhaka Central Jail Friday evening, after being paroled for a matter of hours to attend the janaza of his mother. Deputy inspector general of prisons Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told bdnews24.com: "Ashraf Hossain was released on parole for six hours from noon to allow him to pay his last respects to his mother." The former joint secretary general of BNP, Ashraf was taken in a prison van from Dhaka to Comilla at around 1pm Friday. "He was brought back to Dhaka Central Jail after 6pm when the parole expired," Siddiqui said. Ashraf's son Mainuddin Ashraf told bdnews24.com: "My grandmother died suddenly of cardiac failure." Her first janaza was held at Comilla Noor Mosque after asr prayers. The second janaza was held at our village home, Lalla in Brahmanpara, and the body was buried at the family graveyard today (Friday), Mainuddin said. An arrest warrant was issued against Ashraf in a case filed by the Anticorruption Commission on charges of tax evasion on the purchase of a car. He surrendered to court on Nov 22 last year. Before his arrest on Sept 3 last year, BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia expelled the 'pro-reformist' Ashraf from the party. Majeda Begum left behind six sons, four daughters and grandchildren. bdnew
