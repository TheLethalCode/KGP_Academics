 Dhaka, July 21 (bdnews24.com)  Novelist Mahmudul Haque's namaz-e-janaza was held at the Bangla Academy premises Monday, with family, friends and fellow writers in attendance. The late author's coffin was brought to Bangla Academy's Bardwan House at around 1pm, where Bangla Academy director general Syed Mohammad Shahed, Mahmudul's publisher Mofidul Haque, dramatist Ramendu Majumder, writer Ekhlasuddin Ahmed and film maker Morshedul Islam were among those who laid floral wreaths at the coffin. Young writers, artists and students of Dhaka University also paid their respects to the acclaimed novelist who died in the early hours of Monday morning, at the age of 67. His nephew told bdnews24.com that Mahmudul passed away around 2am at his father-in-law's Lalbagh house. He was admitted to the National Institute of Cardiovascular Disease a week ago, but was brought back home the following day, nephew Alamgir said. Syed Mohammad Shahed told bdnews24.com: "We are grief-stricken. Mahmudul Haque was a novelist of high calibre. We lost a great writer." He was a hugely talented writer, agreed Prof Monsur Musa, a former director general of Bangla Academy. "With his death our world of literature has been greatly affected." "Mahmudul Haq was a powerful novelist," fellow novelist Anisul Haque Mithun said. "Syed Shamsul Haq, Hasan Azizul Huq and Mahmudul Haque are the three most powerful novelists of our country in recent times. " Film maker Morshedul Islam said: "Each of his novels can be turned into a film." The film maker prayed for the departed soul of the late great writer. Undoubtedly one of the renowned authors of Bangla literature, Mahmudul's work encompasses six novels  Anur Pathshala (Anu at School), Nirapod Tandra (Undisturbed Sleep), Jibon Amar Bon (Life is My Sister), Matir Jahaj (Clay Ship), Kalo Baraf (Black Snow) and Khelaghar (Playhouse). He also published a volume of short stories Protidin Ekti Rumal (Everyday, One Handkerchief) and a children's book Chikkore Kabuk. The reclusive author, affectionately known as Botu Bhai, gave up writing in 1982. His wife died on Dec 15 last year, leaving a son and daughter to mourn their father's death. bdnews
