 Dhaka, July 17 (bdnews24.com)--Foreign secretary-level talks between Bangladesh and India began in New Delhi Thursday, foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury said. In reply to reporters questions on Indian transit privileges, at the foreign ministry, Iftekhar repeated his comment of the previous day. "Nothing will be agreed in the ongoing Foreign Office Consultations in New Delhi that is perceived to be against the interests of Bangladesh," he said. Foreign secretary Md Touhid Hossain and his Indian counterpart Shivshankar Menon are leading their respective sides in the two-day long Foreign Office Consultation. In the lead up to the talks, the Indian transit issue has come into focus in Bangladesh with the media reporting widespread misgiving that the country's interests would be hindered by any such agreement. Meanwhile, Bangladesh will propose the launch of a direct passenger bus service between Dhaka and the North Eastern Indian cities of Shillong and Gawahati. India has long been lobbying for Dhaka to give India passage to reach its seven North Eastern states separated from the rest of the country by Bangladesh. "We are interested in transit, we will remain interested in transit for economic causes," Indian High Commissioner to Bangladesh Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty told bdnews24.com a few days before at the foreign ministry. However, foreign secretary Md Touhid Hossain, prior to leaving for New Delhi, told reporters that Bangladesh would not give transit to India right now. He said demarcation of the maritime border, sharing of water resources, building cooperation on security, were the issues to be discussed in the bilateral talks. He said Bangladesh would also request India, which has stopped rice exports, to sell a further 5 lakh tonnes of rice. bdn
