 Dhaka, July 15 (bdnews24.com)-The Anticorruption Commission on Tuesday had no luck with its appeal to a Supreme Court chamber judge to halt a High Court stay order on the proceedings of the Niko graft case against former prime minister Khaleda Zia and others. Justice Md Abdul Matin told the ACC to seek leave to file a regular appeal from an Appellate Division bench. The ACC appealed to the chamber judge to halt on the order on Monday, after the High Court stayed the proceedings of the Niko case proceedings for two months on July 9. Lawyer for the ACC Khurshid Alam Khan told reporters that the chamber judge's court did not accept the commission's appeal for a halt on the High Court order. "The judge asked the ACC to file a regular leave to appeal instead." One of Khaleda Zia's lawyers Kaiser Kamal, however, claimed: "The Appellate Division chamber judge has directly rejected the ACC appeal." "Following the chamber judge's ruling the High Court order prevails. Proceedings of the Niko corruption case filed against Khaleda Zia will remain suspended for two months," the barrister said. The antigraft body filed the case on Dec 9 against five people, including Khaleda Zia, accusing them of causing Tk 10,000 crore in losses to the state by signing oil-gas exploration agreements with Canadian company Niko. The ACC later pressed charges, on May 5, against 11 persons in all, upping the alleged losses to Tk 13,777 crore. bdnew
