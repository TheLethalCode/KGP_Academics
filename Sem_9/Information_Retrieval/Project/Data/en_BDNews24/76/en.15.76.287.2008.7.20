<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 20 (bdnews24.com)National Bureau of Revenue officials will be rewarded for their contribution in reaching their revenue target for the first time in the NBR's history, the finance adviser said Sunday. The government's anticorruption drive created a favourable atmosphere for the rise in revenue collection, but the antigraft drive is not the only reason, said AB Mirza Azizul Islam. "NBR officials played the most active role here," he told reporters after a meeting with NBR officials at the revenue board's Segunbagicha office. "They will be rewarded for their contribution," the adviser said. He added that the finance secretary and the NBR chairman had been given the responsibility to reward them financially. Mirza Aziz also pointed out that the anticorruption drive was not over yet. "It will continue." The NBR collected revenue of Tk 47,201 crore in 2007-08, a rise of 26.82 percent or Tk 9,982 crore over the previous fiscal year. The revenue target was initially set at Tk 43,850 crore for 2007-08, but as revenue collection showed positive results the target was raised to Tk 45,970 crorewith year-end revenue surpassing even the amended target. On whether revenue collection also rose due to the legalisation of previously undeclared money, the adviser said the government had earned Tk 800 crore in the last fiscal year by offering the scope to legalise undeclared income. "But the NBR collected a great deal more than that amount. I think the NBR officials deserve the credit in achieving their revenue target," he said. On the anticorruption drive, Mirza Aziz said the anti-graft drive had aided all areas of revenue, including VAT and customs but especially income tax collection. The finance adviser said he hoped that the environment would continue to play a positive role in future. Sunday's meeting was presided over by NBR chairman Md Abdul Majid. bdnews
