<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, July 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Wachovia Corp led several large US banks in posting weak second-quarter results on Tuesday, as soaring losses from mortgages and other debt led to large write-downs. The loss for Wachovia totaled $8.86 billion. Two Ohio-based regional banks, Fifth Third Bancorp and KeyCorp, posted losses, after warning last month of weak results. Southeast regional banks Regions Financial Corp and SunTrust Banks Inc each said profit fell. Wachovia and Regions also slashed their dividends, while Wachovia, Fifth Third and KeyCorp incurred charges from their tax treatment of some lease transactions. Banks are suffering as the nation's housing crisis deepens, making it harder for consumers, businesses and homebuilders to stay current on their loans. "There is no easy fix for the industry," said Michael Nix, who helps invest $750 million at Greenwood Capital Associates LLC in Greenwood, South Carolina. "We have to see stabilization in housing, and until we see that, it's hard to get comfortable with the sector." In morning trading, Wachovia shares fell 4.6 percent, Fifth Third dropped 3.2 percent, KeyCorp fell 4.9 percent, Regions slid 9.6 percent, and SunTrust fell 3.1 percent. Washington Mutual Inc, the largest savings and loan, is expected to post a big second-quarter loss after U.S. markets close. The KBW Bank Index fell 1.9 percent. It had risen 28.2 percent in the four prior trading days, helped by results from Wells Fargo & Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Corp that weren't as bad as investors feared. "The banking industry is suffering from the tail end effects of a burst housing bubble," said Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. "While capital markets operations weren't hit as badly as in the first quarter, what dominates results now is good, old-fashioned credit deterioration. We're going to see more." WACHOVIA The $8.86 billion loss at Charlotte, North Carolina-based Wachovia equaled $4.20 per share, and compared with a profit of $2.34 billion, or $1.22, a year earlier. Wachovia slashed its quarterly dividend by 87 percent to 5 cents per share, its second reduction this year, and set plans to eliminate more than 10,700 jobs. It plans to cut 6,350 jobs and not fill 4,400 open and contracting positions. Excluding items, the loss was $1.27 per share, compared with the average analyst estimate of $1.30, according to Reuters Estimates. Results also reflected a $6.06 billion goodwill write-down for assets that lost value, a $4.19 billion increase in reserves for bad loans, and $2.89 billion of charges and write-downs related to litigation, disrupted capital markets, and securities sales. New Chief Executive Robert Steel is trying to unload troubled assets and slash costs following Wachovia's disastrous $24.2 billion purchase in October 2006 of Golden West Financial Corp, a specialist in option adjustable-rate mortgages. "Our reported results today are clearly a disappointing performance for which we take responsibility," Steel, a former US Treasury undersecretary, said on a conference call. "We are serious about getting on top of these issues quickly." Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings all downgraded Wachovia's credit ratings. OTHER BANKS Fifth Third, based in Cincinnati, reported a net loss of $202 million, or 37 cents per share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $376 million, or 69 cents. Excluding items, profit was 5 cents per share, compared with the average analyst forecast for nil. Fifth Third lowered its dividend 66 percent last month. Results were hurt by commercial and residential real estate loan losses, especially in Florida and Michigan, the bank said. KeyCorp, based in Cleveland, posted a loss of $1.13 billion, or $2.70 per share, compared with profit of $334 million, or 84 cents, a year earlier. Results reflected a $1.01 billion charge related to leases, and higher reserves for commercial real estate construction loans. KeyCorp halved its dividend last month. Atlanta-based SunTrust said profit available to common stockholders fell 21 percent to $535.3 million, or $1.53 per share, from $673.9 million, or $1.89, a year earlier. Excluding items, profit was 78 cents per share, topping the average forecast for 64 cents. Results reflected the disposal of a 43.6 million share stake in Coca-Cola Co to bolster capital. SunTrust has held Coke shares since 1919, when a predecessor bank helped take the soft drink maker public. Regions, based in Birmingham, Alabama, said net income fell 54 percent to $206.6 million, or 30 cents per share, from $453.3 million, or 63 cents, hurt by losses tied to home equity loans and homebuilders. Excluding items, profit was 39 cents per share. Analysts expected 43 cents. The bank cut its quarterly dividend 74 percent to 10 cents per share from 38 cents
