 BELGRADE, Tue Jul 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bosnian Serb wartime president Radovan Karadzic, wanted for genocide and crimes during the Bosnian war, was arrested near Belgrade after 11 years on the run, in disguise and working as a doctor. Karadzic's arrest was one of the main conditions of Serbian progress towards European Union membership and may be enough to secure Serbia closer ties with the EU and possibly the status of membership candidate state this year. Serbian officials said on Tuesday Karadzic was arrested on Monday near Belgrade. They showed reporters a photograph of an unrecognizable Karadzic, thin and with a long, white beard and flowing hair. He was working for a private doctor, posing as a specialist in alternative medicine, said Rasim Ljajic, Serbia's point man for cooperation with The Hague war crimes tribunal. Officials said he had been living in New Belgrade. "He happily, freely walked around the city," Serbia's war crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic told reporters. "Even the people he rented a flat from were unaware of his identity." Serbian President Boris Tadic said in a terse statement on Monday that Karadzic had been detained. People poured in celebration onto the streets of Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital which Karadzic's troops shelled mercilessly in a 43-month siege during the 1992-95 Bosnian war
