 Dhaka, July 20 (bdnews24.com) - The Appellate Division Sunday stayed for one month a High Court ruling that the president has no jurisdiction to promulgate an ordinance, which is not related to elections during the rule of caretaker government. Appellate Division chamber judge Md Abdul Motin of the Supreme Court passed the order on a government appeal that sought freezes on the HC order. At the same time, justice Motin asked the government to file a regular appeal with the SC. Additional attorney general Salahuddin Ahmed participated in the hearing on behalf of the government, while Kamrul Islam Siddiqui defended the writ petitioner in court. In a ruling on July 13, the HC observed that the president cannot promulgate any ordinance if it has no direct links with the election or is not extremely important during the tenure of the caretaker government. bdnew
