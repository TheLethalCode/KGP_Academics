<TITLE> Nepal to pick first president this week </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KATHMANDU, July 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A special assembly will elect Nepal's first president this week, an official said on Tuesday, weeks after the country abolished its monarchy and became a republic. Abolition of the 239-year-old monarchy was a key demand in a peace deal with Maoist rebels that ended a decade-long civil war. "The president will be elected on July 19 by the constituent assembly," said Mukunda Prasad Sharma, a spokesman of the assembly that will write Nepal's new constitution. The election of the president, a ceremonial position, will clear the way for the former rebels to form a government after they won a surprise victory in elections three months ago. The Maoists, who won the most seats in the assembly but lacked the majority to form a government, say they are in talks with other political parties to form a coalition government.
