 KARACHI, July 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar has been left out of a Champions Trophy training camp after the Pakistan Cricket Board blocked his attendance over an unpaid fine. Chief selector Salahuddin Ahmed told Reuters the board had not cleared Shoaib to be among the 24-man party despite being named in the initial preliminary squad for the Sept 11-28 tournament. "We will call him for the camp once the board gives us the clearance," Ahmed said. Shoaib had been asked to pay a fine of seven million Pakistan rupees ($98,660) by July 14 to be considered for selection. The fine was imposed on him by an appeals tribunal that last month cut from five years to 18 months the ban that was handed down after various acts of indiscipline by the pace bowler. However, Shoaib's lawyer informed the board he would only consider paying the fine when the High Court took a final decision on his petition against both the ban and fine. The court had suspended the ban but not the fine. "We had to give his name because of the ICC deadline. But now until this fine issue is cleared we are not considering him for selection," Ahmed added. Pakistan is due to play a Twenty20 four-nation tournament in Toronto from Aug 17 and then host New Zealand for three one-dayers before the Champions Trophy. Training squad: Shoaib Malik (capt), Misbah-ul-Haq, Younis Khan, Salman Butt, Nasir Jamshed, Khalid Latif, Ahmed Shehzad, Yasir Shah, Shahid Afridi, Sohail Tanvir, Fawad Alam, Abdul Rehman, Mansoor Amjad, Umar Gul, Mohammad Ali, Rao Iftikhar, Sohail Khan, Abdur Rauf, Mohammad Aamer, Kamran Akmal, Sarfraz Ahmed, Saeed Ajmal, Wahab Riaz, Anwar Al
