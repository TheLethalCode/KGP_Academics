 KUALA LUMPUR, July 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Malaysian opposition figure Anwar Ibrahim has given details of his alibi to the police investigating a sodomy allegation, his lawyer said on Friday, as he faced mounting pressure to provide a DNA sample. Anwar, who has dismissed the accusation as a high-level conspiracy to quash the opposition's rise, has refused a DNA test because he said it could be tampered with. Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said on Friday Anwar should provide the sample to prove his innocence. "He said he did not do anything, let's see," Abdullah told reporters. "The result which could prove that he did not do it. That's the way we want to handle it." One of his lawyers said Anwar had given details of his alibi to the police. "He has given all the information to police. Details of witnesses have been provided. The full details of the alibi all have been given but I'm not at liberty to discuss it here," Sivarasa Rasiah told reporters. He said Anwar feared his DNA sample could be tampered with since his accuser, 23-year-old Saiful Bukhari Azlan, has been in police protection since he lodged the complaint on June 28. "Our main concern is the fact that Saiful has been in police custody since June 28 and the police have Anwar's (previous) DNA in their possession," Sivarasa said. He said Anwar might consider giving his DNA sample to the police if Saiful's DNA tests were independently verified. Anwar, a former deputy premier, is leading the charge by the opposition to oust the government at a time when the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition, which has led Malaysia since independence from Britain in 1957, is facing its worst crisis in 50 years. The sodomy charges against Anwar, lodged by a former aide, mirrors events in 1998 when his rise was halted by a jail term for sodomy and corruption. The supreme court overturned the sodomy conviction six years later. Anwar spent a night in police custody earlier this week and has been released on bail. He told reporters on Thursday that he was questioned for five-and-half hours and was also strip-searched. Police have not charged Anwar. Sivarasa said Anwar would fight any legal attempts by the police. "Under our laws, we cannot force a person to give a blood sample. And if an application is made to court, given the present circumstances we will resist it for all the concerns that we've already expressed," he said. Sodomy, even between consenting adults, is regarded as a "heinous crime" and is punishable by up to 20 years in prison in mainly Muslim Malaysia. The Anwar saga, part of a drawn-out political drama, has hurt financial markets with investors fearing a sudden change of government and economic policy.
