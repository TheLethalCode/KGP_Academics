 Sylhet, July 21 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Monday said that it was not yet time for complete withdrawal of the state of emergency. "The local elections are being held by relaxing the state of emergency. The next decision will be taken after evaluating it," the CA said at a press conference after a cabinet meeting in Sylhet Monday. Asked about the upazila polls, Fakhruddin said: "It is the responsibility of the Election Commission. The EC has decided to hold polls in many upazilas." On allegations that many people facing various charges were contesting the city and municipality polls, the CA said the law would determine eligibility of candidates. "The government has nothing to do with it. People will give their verdict in favour of the right people." "The government's responsibility is to create a congenial atmosphere for voters to vote without fear. We must do that," the CA said. Fakhruddin said that some reforms required amendment to the constitution. "If the people raise such a demand, a constitutional commission can be formed to do it." Asked if BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia would be freed, Fakhruddin said that the legal process of releasing her temporarily was underway. "Political parties are not opponents of the government. Political parties are needed to run democracy," he said. Asked about the national charter, Fakhruddin said that steps would be taken on the matter at the end of the dialogue with political parties. He said that the Election Commission had issued rules banning war criminals to take part in the polls. The chief adviser said the cabinet meeting approved in principle Bangladesh Economic Zone Ordinance 2008 and gave final approval to Bangladesh EPZ Workers Association/Industrial Relations Amendment Ordinance 2008. The CA pledged to form a wage board for tea garden workers in order to improve the quality of their life. The advisory council met at Sylhet's Circuit House on Monday, after the previous day's regional dialogue in the northeastern city, an official said. The meeting began around 11am. The advisers had stayed in Sylhet overnight after attending the dialogue session. Saying that a 12-point package for development of Sylhet had been approved in principle by the council of advisers, foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury added, "These will be implemented later through projects." This was the third cabinet meeting of the present government outside Dhaka, chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim said. Sylhet divisional commissioner Zafar Ahmed Khan said that they had submitted a total of 21 proposals to the cabinet for the overall development of the four districts of Sylhet division. bdnews24.com/cor
