<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 21 (bdnews24.com)  Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda Monday expressed disappointment over what he said was a lack of qualified candidates for the Aug 4 city and municipality polls, despite deep reforms to electoral laws. Speaking to reporters in his office, the CEC however hoped the situation would improve during the upazila and national polls. "We are disappointed. Not as many qualified candidates came to contest the city corporation and municipality polls as we expected," the CEC said. Huda doubted the benefit of reforms. "Political parties should nominate acceptable candidates and ordinary people should come up with good candidates." The CEC expressed happiness over broader compliance of election candidates with the rules. Huda, however, said the EC would investigate the allegations against some candidates of violating rules. "An investigation will open into the allegations against returning officers and candidates and steps will be taken in line with the investigation." "A candidate's right to contest the polls cannot be revoked by cancelling candidacy without an investigation," Huda said. On the demand for publication of information about the candidates, the CEC said it was not possible to make information public. "But the EC is gradually publishing information about the candidates finally nominated." bdnews
