<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 22 (bdnews24.com)  Communications adviser Ghulam Quader said Tuesday that political parties opposing local government elections should support the holding of upazila polls. "The government wants to hold upazila elections, which are non-political. I do not understand why the political parties are opposing the polls," the adviser told reporters at the Secretariat. "I hope they will all support the holding of upazila polls," Quader said. "Better conditions cannot be achieved in a day. But the steps we have taken are aimed at bringing qualitative changes." "We can assure that good people will contest the elections," the adviser claimed. "The people are now opposed to corrupt people. And the Election Commission has formulated a law to ban the accused in corruption cases from running in elections." "But the government will not act in any way that hampers anyone's rights," he added. bdnew
