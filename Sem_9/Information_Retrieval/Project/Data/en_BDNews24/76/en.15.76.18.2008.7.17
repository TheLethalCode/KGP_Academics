 Dhaka, July 17 (bdnews24.com)--Bangladesh should have a policy of its own to use foreign aid effectively, says a United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) report on least developed countries. The 'Least Developed Countries Report 2008' was launched worldwide Thursday. Private research organisation Centre for Policy Dialogue released the report in Dhaka. Despite rapid growth, the number of poor was still rising in the LDCs, the report warned, adding that increased income inequality in Bangladesh was hindering poverty reduction. CPD executive director Mustafizur Rahman briefed the press on the key findings of the report and where Bangladesh stands. On LDC export driven growth, the report says it veils real vulnerability as global outlook worsens. It also recommended that poorest nations design and 'own' policies to use foreign aid effectively saying that rules and policies attached to these aids were so stringent that governments were hindered from tailoring development plans to meet local and national conditions. Identifying aid as a tool to mobilise domestic resources to spur economic progress, the study says such aid cannot be 'an engine for long-term development'. According to the document, ongoing aid delivery system continued to undermine effective country ownership due to lack of transparency, coordination between aid and government plans and poor alignment between donors and recipients. UNCTAD suggests a new tool, Aid Management Policy, stressing mutual accountability of donors and recipient governments and aims at reducing transaction costs. It also provides framework to strengthen state capacities for effective use of foreign aid. The study shows aid inflows are mainly directed towards improving social services and infrastructure including governance mechanism rather than increasing productive capacities and promoting structural change and economic diversification. As the report predicts that a continued global economic slowdown would lessen demand for the exports of LDCs, it emphasised the need for diversifying exports and finding greater sources of domestic investment rather than depending heavily on 'official foreign aid'. UNCTAD warns that the growing workers' remittances, contributing towards poverty alleviation for recipients, should not be considered as substitute for long-term capital inflows. The report identified food security as a major threat to economic growth as the recent rise in grain prices would negatively impact the 36 net food-importing LDCs including Bangladesh. "Meanwhile, the 14 food-exporter LDCs would also suffer as import price has gone up simultaneously leading to falling terms of trade," Mustafizur quoted the report. UNCTAD stressed the need to raise farm output and diversify non-agricultural sectors or higher value-added farm activities, such as processing. Touching on where Bangladesh stands among the LDCs, Mustafizur Rahman said Bangladesh was ranked 15th out of the 49 countries with a real GDP growth rate of 6.5 percent in 2006. "Bangladesh is above the average Asian LDCs," he said. Quoting the report, Mustafizur said that assuming the GDP growth rates achieved during 2005-06 were sustained Bangladesh is expected to come out from the LDC group by 2025. "However, we hope that it will not take that long." Recognising Bangladesh as among the top five exporters and relatively less dependent on aid, Mustafizur said the report warns increasing import costs would cause trade deficit to grow. UNCTAD focused on specialisation in production and trade in labor-intensive manufacturing sectors for higher employment generation and export growth. It warned that the already high, income inequality would further rise, said the CPD official. "The report stresses greater policy supports in agricultural production, productivity and productive capacities regarding food security," he said. On achieving human development targets, Mustafizur said on issues like primary education, child mortality and access to improved sanitation, the report said Bangladesh was on track. "However, low progress has been noted in areas like hunger and access to safe water," he added. Summarising the recommendations by UNCTAD, Mustafizur said Bangladesh has to work more on building state capacity, policy conditionality, addressing systematic bias against aid for productive sectors and production of development knowledge. bdn
