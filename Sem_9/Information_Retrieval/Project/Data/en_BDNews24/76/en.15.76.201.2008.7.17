<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 17 (bdnews24.com)Awami League's Amir Hossain Amu called upon government policy makers on Thursday to abandon the move to replace the Representation of the People Order 1972 with the Representation of the People Ordinance 2008, approved in principal by the interim cabinet on Sunday. "In case the government fails to take necessary steps in this regard, AL will be compelled to do so," said the AL presidium member, while taking part in a token hunger strike called by the party's front organisation Jubo League. "People have rejected the idea of paroling AL president Sheikh Hasina; they now want her unconditional release," Amu said. Expressing serious dissatisfaction over the government's rejection of AL leader Md Nasim's bail plea, despite his suffering a stroke, but releasing Jama'at-e-Islami chief Motiur Rahman Nizami on bail, Amu said: "The AL leaders and workers are being harassed everywhere while anti-liberation elements are being bailed out. People will not just let such things happen any more." Starting at 10am, the token hunger strike continued till 1pm in front of AL's head office on Bangabandhu Avenue. Tofail Ahmed, another AL presidium member taking part in the protest programme, called for a stop to all upazila poll activities and warned the caretaker government: "Don't put the government in a confrontational situation against the nation." On moves to amend the RPO, Tofail said: "You cannot repeal the 1972 RPO, which we enacted through the first parliament of an independent Bangladesh. Please stop the process of dumping a new RPO on the people." Calling upon all associate organisations of the party to consolidate their strength, he said: "No election can be held under the emergency rule. The AL and its associates will have to shift to a more rigid stance, if necessary." "The AL will not go for any polls without its leader Sheikh Hasina heading the party ranks." bdnews2
