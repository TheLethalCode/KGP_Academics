 LEEDS, England, July 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - AB de Villiers said his marathon century that put South Africa on course for victory on Sunday was "really rewarding" after he was booed by spectators and abused by England players. De Villiers, who had claimed a controversial catch on Friday before replays showed the ball had been grounded, received a hostile reaction from the England players and was booed by the Headingley crowd on Saturday when he walked to the wicket. But he shrugged off the furore and plundered 174 to help the visitors to 522 all out and a lead of 319 runs, reduced to 269 at the close. England were 50-2 in their second innings. De Villiers's innings spanning almost nine hours was by far the slowest of his six test centuries to date. "It was really rewarding as it was the first time that I have ever been booed walking on to a field and it was quite disappointing and hurt a lot," de Villiers, who proclaimed his innocence regarding the catch, told reporters. "But if anything it motivated me to do better and it feels very satisfying now with a hundred behind my belt." He added, about the abuse from England captain Michael Vaughan and his side: "I'm not going to talk out of the changing room, what happened is in the past, I'm not going to take any offence from that. "(But) I did get my fair share of words when I walked on to the field and that is part of the game. I wasn't expecting anything less. If anything, it played into my hands as it motivated me to stay there for as long as possible." De Villiers, 24, said his patient approach came about because it was what his team required after he walked to the crease with the score 143 for four and the match poised. He paid tribute to the contribution played by Ashwell Prince (149), with whom he put on 212 for the fifth wicket. "He spoke a lot, he told me not to listen to them, to play my game and credit has got to go to him for keeping me calm," de Villiers said. England's James Anderson said his team needed a huge effort from at least two of their batsmen if they are to go into the third test with the series still all square. "We have to dig in as they are going to come out in the morning all guns blazing," Anderson said. "We've got plenty of batting in the tent and a couple of guys need to get big hundreds.
