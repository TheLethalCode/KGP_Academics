<TITLE> Lack of insurance costs $1.2m loss: BCB member </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 16 (bdnews24.com) Bangladesh Cricket Board member Abdul Momen was of the opinion that the BCB's $ 1.2 million loss for not holding a scheduled one-day international between Bangladesh and India in Chittagong last year could have been averted had appropriate measures been taken. Nimbus, BCB's worldwide TV marketing agent, deducted 1.2 million from the minimum guarantee amount of the series due to the non holding of the one-dayer between visitors India and hosts Bangladesh following inclement weather in Chittagong on May 15, 2007. "We could have averted the loss had we been insured for the series," Momen, who was the head of the BCB special review committee to look into the Nimbus agreement, told bdnews24.com. The BCB on July 13 signed a six-year long-form agreement with Nimbus ensuring a minimum guarantee amount of $ 56.88 million. Momen said that he had asked the then chief executive officer Mahmudur Rahman why they were not insured for the series, to which, Rahman's reply was that the premium of insurance was too high. When asked about the matter, Rahmand told bdnews24.com that he would comment after talking to Momen. bdn
