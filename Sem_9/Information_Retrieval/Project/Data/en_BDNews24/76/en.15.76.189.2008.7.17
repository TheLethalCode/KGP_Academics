<TITLE> Flintoff says the best is yet to come </TITLE>

 LONDON, July 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Andrew Flintoff, set to play his first test in 18 months on Friday when England face South Africa in the second test at Headingley, is relishing a new beginning and believes his best years are still ahead of him. Flintoff, 30, last played a test in January 2007 when he was captain of England as they lost the Ashes 5-0. After that he experienced more ankle pain and had to undergo a fourth operation last October before a side strain delayed his comeback this season. The all-rounder, who has been England's most influential cricketer of the past decade, will add firepower to a bowling attack that failed to force a win at Lord's in the first test, which was drawn. "For me it is almost a fresh start," Flintoff, expected to earn a 68th test appearance, told reporters on Wednesday. "A few years ago I was out for a while and then came back with some success - hopefully I can do that again. "I was pleased, ecstatic almost, just to get the call back in the England squad. If you have ever pulled on an England shirt it is enough to get you back out playing one-day internationals, or test cricket." Flintoff has proved his fitness after two four-day matches for county side Lancashire and he is now likely to replace out-of-form Paul Collingwood in his regular number six position. The man known as "Freddie" has been written off several times because of the history with his ankle, but he is putting that behind him and thinking positively about his future. "I still feel the best years are ahead of me - I didn't start bowling properly until I was probably 24 or 25," he said. "So on that front I am pretty new to it all and I feel I have got a better grasp of things." He added: "You see batsmen in their early 30s reach their peak, so hopefully for me it is just around the corner." South Africa, who followed on at Lord's before three batsmen made centuries in the second innings to earn a draw on a flat pitch, will be hoping their fast bowlers are more disciplined this week. "We have spoken to the bowlers, and they have sat and really analysed their performance - as I hoped," South Africa coach Mickey Arthur told reporters. "I'm very, very confident you will see a totally different bowling unit come out here." Opener Neil McKenzie, who batted for over nine hours in the second innings at Lord's where his 138 helped thwart England, hopes to overcome a groin injury in time. Probable teams: England: Michael Vaughan (captain), Andrew Strauss, Alastair Cook, Kevin Pietersen, Ian Bell, Andrew Flintoff, Tim Ambrose, Stuart Broad, Ryan Sidebottom, Monty Panesar, James Anderson. South Africa: Graeme Smith (captain), Neil McKenzie, Hashim Amla, Jacques Kallis, Ashwell Prince, AB de Villiers, Mark Boucher, Paul Harris, Morne Morkel, Dale Steyn, Makhaya Ntini. Umpires: Daryl Harper and Billy Bowden. Referee: Jeff Crowe
