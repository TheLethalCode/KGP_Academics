 NEW DELHI, July 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Samajwadi Party, a key supporter of the ruling coalition in Tuesday's vote of confidence, was fighting to keep its members united on Friday amid signs that some of its 39 MPs were unhappy with the decision to back the government. A meeting called on Friday by Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav to discuss the vote of confidence was attended by only 16-17 lawmakers, an unnamed party official present at the meeting said, amid reports that many members would defy the party whip. One rebel MP said several parliamentarians would vote against the government. "Not everyone is happy. I know there are seven, eight MPs who will not vote for the government," said the rebel, Munawwar Hasan. The government faces a no-confidence vote on Tuesday after its communists allies withdrew support to protest a civilian nuclear deal with the United States. The Samajwadi Party stepped in to replace the communists' support. But the vote still looks extremely tight. In better news for the government, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), which has five MPs, will support the ruling coalition in the vote, the Press Trust of India news agency reported on Friday, quoting the party's chief whip, Teklal Mahto. The JMM, although formally part of the coalition, had been reluctant to back it in the vote.
