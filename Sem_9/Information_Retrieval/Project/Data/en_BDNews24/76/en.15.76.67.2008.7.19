<TEXT>
 Noakhali, July 19 (bdnews24.com)Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed said Saturday the government was trying to control political parties. "The government wants to have its own candidates elected through polls-fixing," Mojaheed alleged at a party meeting at Noakhali Lawyers Association auditorium. "The government damaged the country by attempting to put political parties in shackles," Mojaheed demanded an immediate election. The Jamaat leader said the Jan 22, 2007 polls had been forestalled to stop the politics inspired by Islamic values. Mojaheed accused the government of playing a game of splitting political parties in the name of reforms. "The government is plotting to take Khaleda Zia off politics. Mojaheed claimed that the arrest of Jamaat chief Motiur Rahman Nizami on corruption charges raised questions about the roles of government and Anticorruption Commission. Pointing to a report of the Transparency International Bangladesh, the Jamaat leader said Tk 5,000 crore was exchanged in bribes during the rule of the caretaker government. "It has been very clear in the last 18 months that how an unelected government can put a country in trouble," he added. bdnews2
