 MADRID, July 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona are seeking a negotiated settlement that would allow Argentina's Lionel Messi to miss the Olympic Games in Beijing, the Primera Liga club have said. Argentina's Olympic team coach Sergio Batista said on Wednesday he was confident the 21-year-old winger would be joining up with them, in line with FIFA regulations that state clubs should release Under-23 players for the event. "We have a case and we will fight for Messi to play the Champions League qualifier because he should be with us. We have let FIFA know this," Barca sports director Txiki Begiristain was quoted as saying in Spanish media on Thursday. "We continue insisting but we hope we can reach a settlement that is agreed by all parties." After finishing third in the Primera Liga last season, Barca have to play a Champions League third qualifying round tie over two legs on Aug. 12/13 and Aug. 26/27 to make the group stage. They have consistently stated they want as many of their players as possible available for these fixtures. The Olympic soccer tournament runs from Aug. 6-23. Barcelona president Joan Laporta added: "Barca have an Olympic spirit and a Champions League spirit and we don't want to fall out with Argentina Football Association (AFA) president Julio Grondona. "Barca's interests should be obvious and we ask they understand what we are calling for. We hope it is possible to reach a satisfactory conclusion." Messi, who has returned to Barcelona for pre-season training, has already stated he would like to attend the Olympic Games
