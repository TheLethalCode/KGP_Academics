 Chapainawabganj, July 18 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Rifles condemned and protested the gunning down of two Bangladesh Rifles personnel by India's Border Security Force on Friday in Chapainawabganj, while at least one BSF casualty was also reported. The condemnation came at a press conference at the BDR headquarters at Peelkhana, where BDR director (operations and training) Col Md Abdul Halim replied to questions from the media. BDR had earlier reported that Indian border guards gunned down two of their men on the Raghunathpur border in Chapainawabganj in the early hours of Friday. The dead were identified as habildar Abdul Hannan Sarakar, 55, of Bogura and lance naik Krishnapada Saha, 28, of Magura. Col Abdul Halim said: "We have learnt from local sources that at least one BSF member was also killed in the incident, and the BSF casualties might be more than one." "Bangladesh believes in maintaining friendly relations with neighbouring countries. This incident would not have taken place if BSF showed restraint like BDR. We strongly condemn and protest this incident." The incident coincided with a two-day foreign secretary-level meeting between Bangladesh and India, which began in New Delhi on Thursday. Asked whether the incident was created to put pressure on Bangladesh during the ongoing foreign secretary talks, that discussed border security and Indian transit among other issues, the BDR official replied: "There would be no benefit by doing such things. It may be coincidental. I personally think it has no link with the transit issue." Senior officials from BDR and BSF held a flag meeting Friday afternoon at BDR 39 Battalion headquarters, with BDR Rajshahi sector commander Col Mohammad Iqbal leading the Bangladesh side. Lieutenant colonel Golam Kibria Md Neyamat Ullah, commander of 39 Battalion, had told bdnews24.com Friday morning that a group of India's Border Security Force entered about 1300 yards into Bangladesh territory in Durlavpur union, shortly after Thursday midnight. On a tip, Abdul Hannan Sarkar along with a BDR team rushed to the area and challenged the BSF members when the Indian border guards opened fire on them killing Abdul Hannan and Krishnapada Saha at the scene, said Golam Kibria. After a post-mortem, Dr Mohammad Tajuddin of Chapainawabganj Sadar Hospital told reporters that Abdul Hannan had received two bullets and Krishnapada six bullets. The foreign ministry condemned the killings in a statement Friday, with foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury calling it a "serious incident". "We are awaiting a full report and will react more appropriately when we are made aware of the facts," the foreign adviser told bdnews24.com. "For now, we pray for the salvation of the souls of the two brave Bangladeshis who have been killed," said the adviser. "Our condolences and sympathy are due to the families of the bereaved." Iftekhar said the home ministry would carry out an investigation into the incident and report to the foreign ministry, but he did not give any timeframe. He refused to say anything on whether the incident would affect the ongoing foreign secretary meeting in New Delhi. Bangladesh foreign secretary Md Touhid Hossain, before departing for Delhi to meet his Indian counterpart, said on Wednesday that the deaths of BDR personnel by BSF in 'border skirmishes' would be one of the issues at the talks. bdnews24.com/a
