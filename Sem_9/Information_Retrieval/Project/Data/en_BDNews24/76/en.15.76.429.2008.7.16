 KABUL, Wed Jul 16,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan President Hamid Karzai fired the attorney-general on Wednesday after the country's top prosecutor announced he intended to run for the presidency in elections next year. Abdul Jabar Sabit has also accused some government and parliament members of corruption and tried to prosecute leaders of former armed groups. He told the media on Tuesday that he would stand in presidential elections planned for next year.

He was appointed attorney-general and announced a war against endemic corruption in Afghanistan as his top priority. But his efforts have largely been unsuccessful. One of Sabit's former deputies, Bashir Ahmad Fazl, has become interim attorney-general. Karzai, who has ruled Afghanistan since the Taliban's fall and won the presidency in 2004 elections, has strongly hinted that he would again run for office. Karzai has attracted stern criticism at home and among some of his Western allies for relying on and accommodating factional leaders in his government. Some of them led armed groups that helped US-led forces in toppling the Taliban's radical Islamist government. Factional members serve in several key government positions and as provincial authorities.
