<TEXT>
 COLOMBO, Sri Lanka, 22 July (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ajantha Mendis loomed large as the biggest obstacle to India's chances of claiming a first series win in Sri Lanka for 15 years. The 23-year-old unorthodox spinner will be making his test debut at the Sinhalese Cricket Club, where the hosts have won seven of the last ten tests, when the opening match of a three-test series starts on Wednesday. Mendis, Sri Lanka's outstanding performer in the recent Asia Cup, will partner world record holder Muttiah Muralitharan and will bowl a perplexing mix of off breaks, leg breaks, googlies and top spinners. Despite the threat posed by Mendis, former India captain Rahul Dravid warned his team-mates they cannot forget that Sri Lanka have other match-winners. "It will be a big mistake to focus just on Mendis," Dravid told reporters on Monday. "They have got a couple of other guys (Muralitharan and Chaminda Vaas) who have got 1,000 wickets between them." Dravid also admitted that Sri Lanka at home posed a formidable challenge. "They have got the right balance in these conditions and they are always a big threat at home," he said. "But we have come here with a good team as well and if we play to our potential, I think it will be a good test series." Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene insisted his team were focused on their gameplans. "India have some good players and are always tough opposition, but we're focused on our own game and looking forward to the challenge," Jayawardene told Reuters. "If we can be disciplined in the execution of our gameplans and play our best cricket then we will be difficult to beat." Sri Lanka will choose between Thilan Thushara and Nuwan Kulasekera as the only fast bowler alongside veteran Vaas. Prasanna Jayawardene will keep wicket, allowing Kumar Sangakkara, the world's top-ranked test batsman, to focus on his batting. Chamara Silva and Tillakaratne Dilshan are competing for one place in the middle order. India will choose between a three-man pace attack or the inclusion of off-spinner Harbhajan Singh instead of pace bowlers Munaf Patel or Zaheer Khan. India's settled and experienced batting line-up includes Sachin Tendulkar, who returns after recovering from a groin injury. Tendulkar needs 172 runs to beat Brian Lara's world record test aggregate of 11,953 runs. Opener Gautam Gambhir takes the place of Wasim Jaffer, who opened during India's last series against South Africa.
