 Dhaka, July 17 (bdnews24.com)Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed said Thursday his government was working to bring reforms to the electoral process for the good of the people. The chief adviser's comment comes just days after the caretaker government agreed in principle to approve the new Representation of the People Ordinance 2008, containing some controversial provisions on electoral process. "The present non-party caretaker government has been trying its best over the past one and half years to tackle some problems, in particular systemic corruption, which has prevented us from realising our true potentials," Fakhruddin said, inaugurating the Nobel Peace Prize Exhibition at Grameen Bank headquarters in Mirpur. "We have also been striving to bring much needed reforms to the executive, judiciary and the electoral process, so that these institutions facilitate our socio-economic progress," he said. The Nobel Peace Centre holds a peace exhibition every year in the country of the winner. As part of the process, a peace exhibition takes place in Dhaka to highlight the activities of Professor Muhammad Yunus and the Grameen Bank--joint holder of 2006 Nobel Peace Prize. The Norwegian Nobel Peace Centre, Royal Norwegian Embassy in Dhaka and Grameen Bank are jointly holding the exhibition to highlight the award of 2006's Nobel Peace Prize to Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank. Yunus, chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee Ole Danbolt Mjs, director of the Nobel Peace Centre Bente Erichsen, and Norwegian ambassador Ingebjorg Stofring addressed the inauguration of the exhibition titled "Jobra to Oslo". Yunus told the audience that the Nobel Peace Prize had given Bangladesh a new chance to rethink the future of Bangladesh. "We have discovered our ability to change our destiny," said the Nobel laureate. The chief adviser in his address highlighted some of the successes and problems of Bangladesh and paid tribute to Yunus for reducing poverty through his micro-credit programme, pointing out that 80 percent of Bangladeshi households now had access to micro-credit which had become a permanent feature of our financial landscape. "We are hopeful that all poor households in the country will have access to micro-credit soon," Fakhruddin added. . The chief adviser, a former governor of Bangladesh's central bank, said the poverty level in Bangladesh was 74 percent in the 1970s, coming down to 40 percent in 2005. "The decline continues. And the good news is that there has not been any increase in inequality. The conditions of the poor are improving steadily," said Fakhruddin, who was also managing director of micro-credit organisation PKSF said. Ole Danbolt Mjs, calling Bangladesh his second home and terming Yunus "half-Norwegian", said: "This exhibition can give Bangladesh and the world the idea that the world may be free from poverty." bdn
