 London, July 22 (bdnews24.com) A group of UK-qualified Bangladeshi lawyers has formed Society of Bangladeshi Solicitors in the United Kingdom. The inauguration ceremony was held Friday at the hall of the Law Society, a representative body of more than 100,000 solicitors in England and Wales. The head of the judiciary in England and Wales, Lord Chief Justice Philips, attended the event as chief guest. Paul Marsh, president of the Law Society of England and Wales, Safi U Ahmed, Bangladesh high commissioner to the UK, Lady Baroness Pola Uddin, member of the House of Lords and Immigration Judge Belayat Hussain were among other guests. The event was chaired by the Society's president Sohul Ahmed Moku. Muhammad Abul Kalam, secretary general of the Society, highlighted the main objectives and said: "The Society is set up to negotiate and lobby with the profession's regulators, government and others, and is to offer training facilities to Bangladeshi solicitors." Welcoming the initiative, Lord Philips said: "Being a solicitor you have the obligation and must initiate doing right for the community." Mentioning the proverb 'Charity begins at home', the top judge said the initiative to launch the society was admirable. "Commitment of legal professionals is vital for the progress of a community and legal professionals must help poor and disadvantageous members the society." "England is a country where all are treated equal, regardless of their colour, race, religion or gender. English law is available to all. Everyone has the right to do anything they wish, unless it is constrained by the law," the chief justice said. Inviting the Bangladeshi solicitors to join the judiciary, he said, "We want a judiciary which reflects the diversity of the legal profession, which in turn should mirror society. We therefore encourage solicitors from under-represented groups such as women and members of the ethnic minority communities." Lord Philips reiterating his position on Sharia law and responding to mainstream right wing media criticism said: "Sharia law introduced the Law of Trust what we English are proud of, which was introduced first by the Sharia Law." The English introduced Law of Trust 300 years later, he said. Lord Phillips also expressed concern over the widespread misunderstanding in the western world as to the nature and applicability of Sharia law. Paul Marsh, praising commitments of the Society's members to uphold professional integrity reminded them of their obligation and duty towards the community. "Society of Bangladeshi Solicitors can make a notable difference to the profession," Marsh said. He also said that hopefully not too many years away, a Bangladeshi solicitor would be in his position to lead the Law Society. Lady Baroness Pola Uddin said the Society as an interest group would have a direct impact on policy making in relation to ethnic minority aspects. Safi U Ahmed, Bangladesh high commissioner to the UK, congratulated the inception of the Society. Safi reminded the audience that the traditional linkage between UK and Bangladesh common law. "Like many other Commonwealth countries, Bangladesh judiciary is closely linked with the British judicial system." "The backbone of our judiciary had its legal education in the UK, and the Society of Bangladeshi Solicitors will certainly help enhance our legal expertise in Bangladesh," he said. bdne
