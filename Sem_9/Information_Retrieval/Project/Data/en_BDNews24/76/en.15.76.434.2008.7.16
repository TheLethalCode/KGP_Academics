 Dhaka, July 16 (bdnews24.com)The High Court on Wednesday granted one-month interim bail to Khaleda Zia's parliamentary affairs adviser Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury, former BNP lawmaker Nasir Uddin Pintu, and Partex Group chairman and ex-MP MA Hashem, all three having been arrested and detained in cases filed by the Anticorruption Commission. The same court order stayed the trial proceedings of the three separate graft cases filed against them, and asked the government to explain within two weeks why the cases should not be scrapped. A HC bench of justices Sharifuddin Chakladar and Md Imdadul Haque Azad handed down the ruling on the three separate bail petitions submitted by the accused. Representing all three, barrister Rafiqul Haque said during the bail hearing: "According to ACC law, investigation in cases of this nature must be completed within 60 days, but the commission through its failure to press charges has defied that clause." Advocate Moazzem Hossain, lawyer for the ACC, replied: "It's not mandatory to submit the investigation report within 60 days." The ACC filed a graft case against SQ Chowdhury in June 2007. The antigraft body filed separate cases against Pintu and MA Hashem in December. bdnews24.com/
