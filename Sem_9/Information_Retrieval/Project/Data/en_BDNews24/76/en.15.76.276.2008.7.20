 Dhaka, July 20 (bdnews24.com)  BNP will not yield to conditions or compromise over Khaleda Zia's release, said a senior party figure on Sunday. BNP joint secretary general Goyeshwar Chandra Roy said his party had never yielded to any conditions or compromise and would not start doing so now. "We want unconditional release of our chairperson to overcome the current political crisis," Goyeshwar said at a press conference organised by former Jubo Dal leaders at BNP's Naya Paltan office. He called the government's decision to release Arafat Rahman Coco on medical parole a positive one. The former leaders of the BNP front organisation demanded unconditional release of chairperson Khaleda and other BNP leaders including Tarique Rahman, Mirza Abbas and Syed Moazzem Hossain. Former Jubo Dal vice president Ziaul Haque Milu, reading out a written statement, alleged there was a conspiracy to destroy the country's nationalist forces. They expressed resentment over the "biased attitude of the government". Milu demanded the government release Khaleda Zia so that she could stand by her people. bdnew
