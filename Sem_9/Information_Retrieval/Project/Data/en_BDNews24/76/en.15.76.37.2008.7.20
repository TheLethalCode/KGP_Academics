 Dhaka, July 20 (bdnews24.com)Railway authorities of Bangladesh and India have agreed to cut travel time by two hours on Dhaka-Kolkata passenger train Maitree Express by minimising customs and immigration formalities, officials said Sunday. According to a preliminary agreement between Bangladesh Railway and India's Eastern Railway, the time for customs and immigration at border stations will be reduced to three hours from the existing five. In line with the new arrangement, Maitree will reach Dhaka from Kolkata in 10 hours. A team of the Eastern Railway will arrive in Dhaka and hold a meeting on July 27 in an attempt to finalise the plan. "On July 27, the heads of department meeting will discuss cuts in travel time," Quazi Asadullah, additional director general (operation) of Bangladesh Railway, told bdnews24.com Sunday. The plan for reducing travel time for Maitree came up for discussion at the just-concluded Bangladesh-India foreign secretary talks in New Delhi. "Both Bangladesh and India have agreed that travel time should be reduced," foreign secretary Md Touhid Hossain told reporters at a press conference at the foreign ministry Sunday. At present, Maitree starting from Dhaka stops at Bangladesh bordering station Darsana for two and a half hours and for as many hours at Indian bordering station Gede for customs and immigration. bdn
