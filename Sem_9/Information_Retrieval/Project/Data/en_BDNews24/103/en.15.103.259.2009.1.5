<TEXT>
 New Delhi, Jan 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's government said that it had handed over evidence on the Mumbai attacks to Pakistan on Monday, and it expected a prompt investigation. "The material is linked to elements in Pakistan," the foreign ministry said in a statement. "It is our expectation that the Government of Pakistan will promptly undertake further investigations in Pakistan and share the results with us so as to bring the perpetrators to justice." The coordinated strikes in Mumbai by 10 gunmen killed 179 people. India has blamed Pakistani militants for the attacks, which has revived hostilities between the nuclear-armed neighbors that have fought three wars since 1947. The evidence presented to Pakistan included details of a confession from the one surviving gunman, details of communications links with "elements in Pakistan," and data retrieved from GPS and satellite phones, the ministry said.
