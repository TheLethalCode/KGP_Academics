 Dhaka, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com)  Head of UN panel on Bangladesh elections Francesc Vendrell on Friday said some election-related complaints made by the BNP might be "valid" but those might not have changed the results. Wrapping up a week's visit, Vendrell, head of the UN panel on Bangladesh election formed by the secretary-general, said the ninth parliamentary polls were "free and fair", according to the observations of the local and international observers. "Some of the complaints made by the BNP may have been valid. But those may not change the polls results," Vendrell told reporters at a news conference at Sonargaon Hotel in the afternoon. He also said Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina, whom he had met in the morning, wanted to work with BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia in parliament. The head of UN panel urged the BNP to register complaint with the Election Commission (EC) and asked the EC to examine the complaints carefully. He said the Awami League and the BNP should show "restraints" for the sake of the nation. "We have not observed elections. But the national and the international observers have told us that the elections were free and fair," said Vendrell. Referring to his meeting with the prime minister in-waiting Hasina on Friday morning, he said, "She (Hasina) looks forward to work with Khaleda Zia in parliament". "She has the right kind of feeling for the opposition," he said. Vendrell brushed aside BNP secretary-general Khandker Delwar Hossain's allegation on the observers' partisanship. He said the panel would prepare a final report on Bangladesh's polls and submit it to UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon. During his Nov. 1 Dhaka visit, Ban announced sending the three-member panel to weigh the country's pre- and post-election situation. bd
