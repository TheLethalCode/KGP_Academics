 Dhaka, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com)  BNP has said Awami League 'digitally rigged' the general election of Dec. 29. The allegation has reference to the promise its bitter rival made in the election manifesto of ushering in the digital era in Bangladesh. "It's unbelievable that nearly 90 percent votes were cast in Monday's polls, and that means a voter needed only 55 seconds to cast ballot," BNP office secretary Rizvi Ahmed said, giving reporters a mathematical analysis at the party's Gulshan office. "Awami League men have forcefully occupied Kotwali BNP office, shops of BNP adherents and attacked them physically they are intimidating them and are out to create BAKSAL-type anarchy." "Awami League president Sheikh Hasina on one hand said her party doesn't believe in politics of revenge and her party men, on the other, are launching attacks on the houses of BNP leaders and workers," he alleged. "Scores of our workers were injured in the attacks, many in remote areas have been driven out of homes, many houses of Munshiganj BNP workers were set ablaze." "What signals are these incidents giving us?" he asked, adding BNP will keep the media informed of the repressions through regular press briefings. He also alleged workers of AL and its youth wing Bangladesh Jubo League had beaten up BNP supporters in Gafargaon-Muktagachha in Mymensingh, Polash in Narsingdi, Kurigram, Senbagh in Noakhali, Gopalpur in Tangail, Pabna, Sitakunda in Chittagong and Kasba in Brahmanbaria. Losing BNP candidates, meanwhile, gave accounts of irregularities in the election to BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia in the evening. Sylhet-2 candidate M Ilyas Ali showed journalists three torn ballots with a seal stamped on the sheaf of paddy symbol. He said he picked up those ballot papers from Dohal Primary School ground in Rampasha, claiming he had seen scores of such ballot papers behind the school, a polling centre in that constituency Sylhet-3 candidate Shafi Ahmed Chowdhury and Kishoreganj-Kularchar candidate Shariful Alam too narrated how BNP workers were being attacked and intimidated. They accused the presiding officers and the police of involvement in rigging the election.
