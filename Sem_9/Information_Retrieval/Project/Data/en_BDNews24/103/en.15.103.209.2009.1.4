<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com)  Communication and public works adviser Ghulam Quader has pitched for raising the retirement age bar for civil servants from 57 to 65. "The current retiring age limit of 57 should be pushed to 65 to reap the maximum from an average performer even," he said at a farewell meeting at the public works ministry on Sunday ahead of the new cabinet members' oath-taking scheduled for Tuesday. "The government is being deprived of the services of many experienced officers and employees as they have to retire now at 57." Addressing the younger group of civil servants, who are opposed to raising of the retirement age bar, Quader said, "Please accept the extension proposal, because you too will reap its benefit at the fag end of your career." He urged government officials to promote national interest whenever there are conflicts. "There may be conflicts between the government and the state while one has to discharge administrative responsibilities. In such cases, the officers will have to uphold the nation's interest first." Quader thanked the ministry officials for their cooperation while he worked with them during the caretaker government's regime. "Good governance is of prime importance. We worked through the last two years to establish and promote good governance and I received full cooperation from the administrative officials and employees." bdnews24
