With seats called so far and results from other constituencies, the party that led the country's independence war was poised to win over 250 seats, according to bdnews24.com correspondents and TV stations. The AL and allies have so far won 191 seats, while BNP and allies have managed just 22, according to results obtained from election officials at various levels till 2am.

Hasanul Haq Inu of JSD, who ran as a grand alliance nominee with AL's logo boat as his symbol, became MP for the first time, winning Kushtia-2. AL's Abul Maal Abdul Muhit beat former BNP finance minister M Saifur Rahman, who probably ran his last election, in Sylhet-1 constituency, which has always been a ruling party seat since 1971.
