<TEXT>
 LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices rose above $40 a barrel on Monday, up nearly 8 percent on the previous session, after violence between Israel and Hamas served as a reminder of tensions that could threaten crude supplies from the Middle East. U.S. light, sweet crude was up $3.18 at $40.89 a barrel by 1000 GMT (5 a.m. EST), below a session high of $42.20. Oil is on track for a nearly 60 percent loss this year, the biggest annual fall since futures began trading 25 years ago.

Top exporter Saudi Arabia had informed its customers of cuts even before the meeting. OPEC has cut output three times in an effort to remove about 5 percent of world supply to halt the slump. OPEC President Chakib Khelil said on Saturday he expected oil prices to stabilize within the next two months after the output cuts. Oil is down more than $100 a barrel from a record peak of more than $147 in July, depressed by the downturn in the world economy which has hit demand for fuel.
