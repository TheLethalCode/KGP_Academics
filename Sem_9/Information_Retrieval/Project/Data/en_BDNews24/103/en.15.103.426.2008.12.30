 Dhaka, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com)A US-based observer group says the Dec 29 polls "reflected the will of Bangladeshi people", and urges all political parties to work for a smooth power handover. "The International Republican Institute found Bangladesh's Dec 29 parliamentary elections major step forward in demonstrating the country's commitment to strengthening democracy," the Washington-based group said Tuesday, revealing its preliminary findings. "The process appears to have yielded a result that accurately reflects the will of Bangladesh voters," Barry Newman, head of the 65-member polls observation mission, told reporters at the Radisson Hotel. The institute said its delegations were imprssed by the dedications of Bangladeshi voters to stand in queues to cast votes. "What is crucial in the aftermath of this election is that Bangladesh's leaders recognise that election day is only one part of a democratic political process," said Newman. "Political parties, candidates and citizens should accept the results and work together for a peaceful transition of power," she said Referring to her meeting the political leaders, Newman said, "We have met the leaders of both the parties and the meetings led us to beleive they are going to accept the results and help form the government". "The IRI delegates were also impressed by efforts to ensure procedural transparency...Though the campiagn was abbreviated, political parties and independent candidates had an equal and adequate opportunity to make their case before Bangaldeshi public," she said. She also referred to some violation of electoral laws during the polls. "In some instances, observers even noted campaiging taking place around the polling stations, which is direct violation of the law. "Nonetheless, Bangladeshi leaders and citizens should be congratulated for an election that restores the electoral foundation of Bangladesh's democracy," said the IRI delegation head. Newman said the IRI would publish its full report on the general election after assimilating information across the country. bdne
