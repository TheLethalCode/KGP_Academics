 Dhaka, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com)  All preparations for the new cabinet to be sworn in on Tuesday evening at Bangabhaban have been completed, cabinet secretary Md Abdul Aziz said on Sunday. "We have made all arrangements for the new ministers' oath-taking ceremonies on Tuesday. Invitation to attend the event has also been forwarded to about a thousand invitees," said Aziz. President Iajuddin Ahmed will administer the oath at the Darbar Hall of the presidential palace. The invitees to the grand ceremony include former presidents, former chief advisers, speakers, ministers, advisers, state ministers, deputy ministers, heads of diplomatic missions, senior civil and military officials and two representatives each from Awami League, BNP and other registered political parties. Asked about Jamaat-e-Islami not being invited to the state function, the secretary retorted evasively: "The invites have been sent out following the accepted norms in this regard." The 1971 liberation war criminals' lists drawn up by the Sector Commanders' Forum and other freedom fighters' organisations mention Jamaat-e-Islami ameer Motiur Rahman Nizami and secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojahid as ace war criminals. Freedom fighters' organisations have all along been urging the government not to invite the anti-liberation elements to any state function. The AL's election manifesto also promised to try the war criminals. The same function will see the prime minister, deputy ministers and state ministers sworn in. The lists containing the names of the members of the cabinet have not arrived at the Cabinet Division until Sunday noon, the secretary said. AL was invited to form the new government after the party won an overwhelming 230 out of the 299 parliamentary seats on offer in the ninth parliamentary polls on Dec. 29, The AL, however, has indicated it will accommodate their allies also in the new cabinet. AL-led grand alliance alliesJatiya Party, JSD and WPB got 27, 3 and 2 seats, bringing the grand alliance total to 262. The BNP-led four-party alliance secured 32 seats. The grand alliance lawmakers took the oath to office on Saturday afternoon. The cabinet secretary presided over a meeting of the committee of secretaries on Sunday, which discussed seven administrative issues, he said. bd
