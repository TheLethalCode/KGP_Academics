 Abdur Rahim Harmachi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com)  Despite the ongoing global economic crisis, Bangladesh has recorded some $451.28 crore in foreign remittances in the six months up to December last year, the central bank boss said Sunday. "The country's foreign exchange reserve is receiving a huge boost from the strength of remittance inflow," Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com on Sunday. The Bank's latest figures showed inflow of $76.14 crore in November and $76.58 crore in December, adding up to $451.28 crore in the first half of the current fiscal year  a 31.17 percent or $107.25 crore increase over the corresponding period of FY2007-8. The foreign exchange reserves at the central bank stood at $586 crore on Sunday, said Salehuddin. "The global crisis has not had an impact on foreign remittance and we don't see an immediate impact." "We expect remittances will jump to over $900 crore by the end of the current financial year," he said, recalling the previous fiscal year's total of $791.48 crore. "Remittance has continued to climb since the financial crisis began spreading globally in September last year," he said. "Exports fell slightly in October but rose again in November," the governor said. "But we are watching the current world economic crisis and Bangladesh Bank and the government have taken manifold measures to avert any major impact here." Central bank figures show remittance in July, the first month of the current fiscal year, stood at $82.07 crore, $72.19 crore in August, $79.42 crore in September and $64.85 crore in October. Remittances have been surging year-on-year recently: FY 2007-8 witnessed a record $791.48 crore against $598 crore in FY2006-7 and $398 crore in 2005-7. bdnews
