 Chittagong, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com)BNP joint secretary general and former minister Abdullah Al Noman Saturday alleged that polls were "rigged subtly" in Chittagong-9 constituency. "Votes were engineered" in the constituency in the ninth general election held on Dec 29, Noman told newsmen at a press conference here. "Many voters with national identity cards could not vote as voters' list with photo at the centres did not match with lists given to candidates," he said. "Some 90 percent of the women voters turned up in many polling centres, but less than 70 percent managed to vote," Noman claimed. The defeated BNP candidate showed a video clip to newsmen, at Chittagong Press Club, which apparently documented how the polls officers on duty responded to the alleged irregularities. Awami League candidate Dr. Afsarul Amin won the seat bagging 137,106 votes. Noman secured 127,815, trailing by just 9291, in one of the close encounters in an otherwise one-sided election. He also questioned the role of presiding and polling officers, election observers and on-duty Ansars. Noman alleged senior election officials, when informed on the polling day, did not respond to his allegations. Noman claimed he lost a "a safe BNP seat" because many of his supporters failed to vote. bdn
