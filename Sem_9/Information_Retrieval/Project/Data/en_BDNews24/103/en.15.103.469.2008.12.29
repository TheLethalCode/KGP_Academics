 SRINAGAR, India, Mon Dec 29, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - No clear winner emerged from elections in Jammu and Kashmir after counting closed on Sunday, with a period of uncertainty expected in the disputed region before a coalition is cobbled together. Counting of votes for 87 assembly seats in disputed Jammu and Kashmir ended after a marathon seven-stage election that ended on Wednesday in Srinagar. Jammu and Kashmir came under New Delhi's direct rule in July after a People's Democratic Party-led coalition government fell over a land dispute. The controversy became the trigger for some of Kashmir's biggest anti-India protests since a revolt against New Delhi's rule began in 1989. The National Conference party was the region's biggest winner, ending with 28 seats, but still well short of a majority, according to official figures. The party said it was ready to enter into an alliance with ruling Congress party, which won 17 seats. "We are open to an alliance with Congress," National Conference president Omar Abdullah told reporters. Indian television reported that Congress party officials were meeting in New Delhi to discuss the alliance offer. Main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party won 11 seats, and the People's Democratic Party won 21 seats. Despite a boycott call by separatists and Muslim militants, more than 60 percent of Kashmir's 6.4 million voters participated in the elections, taken as an encouraging sign in New Delhi. Voting also passed relatively peacefully compared with previous polls. Separatists in Kashmir, claimed by India and Pakistan but ruled in part by both, say New Delhi portrays voting as an endorsement of its rule over the Himalayan region. Overall violence has fallen significantly across Kashmir since India and Pakistan began peace talks in 2004, although New Delhi has imposed a pause in that dialogue since last month's Mumbai attacks blamed on Pakistan-based militants. Officials say more than 47,000 people have been killed in nearly two decades of violence involving Indian troops and Islamist militants in Kashmir. Separatists put the toll at 100,000
