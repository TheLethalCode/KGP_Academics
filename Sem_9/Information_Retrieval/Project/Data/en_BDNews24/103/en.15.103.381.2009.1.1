 Dhaka, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain has said BNP was undone by conspiracies at home and abroad, and claimed people now know how the elections were 'rigged'. "People now understand how the rigged election took place and how the votes were forged. The conspiracy has now become clear," he said. He made the remarks after laying wreaths on Thursday at the grave of BNP founder late president Ziaur Rahman marking the 30th founding anniversary of the Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, the party's student front. "Let the Awami League form government. Let them run the country since they have had an opportunity." Asked if they would cooperate with the new government, Delwar said, "We want to see how the Awami League fulfils the promises it made to the people. "First, we will watch things closely. After evaluation of their work, we will make our move collectively." Delwar said, "We will be organising and strengthening the party. BNP was always on the side of the people and it will be working for their welfare." Delwar, like many four-party alliance heavyweights, lost the race, from Manikganj-3 constituency. Amanullah Aman, Fazlul Huq Milon. Habib-un-Nabi Khan Sohel, incumbent JCD president Azizul Bari Helal, general secretary Shafiul Bari Helal were present at the ceremony. bdne
