 Dhaka, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister-elect Sheikh Hasina on Thursday sought the assistance of the United Nations to hold war crimes trial, an aide said. Hasina talked to the UN secretary-general's special envoy Ian Martin about the trial when the two met at Sudha Sadan in the evening. "Awami League president Sheikh Hasina wanted to whether the United Nations can extend any cooperation in the process of trying the war criminals," Hasina's foreign affairs adviser Mohammad Zamir told reporters after the meeting. "She said she will be pleased if the United Nations could help in trying the war criminals," Zamir said. "In reply, Martin said according to international law the UN can cooperate if Bangladesh seek cooperation," Zamir said. He said Martin with UN chief Ban Ki-moon's message congratulating Hasina on her party's overwhelming victory in Monday's election. Martin told reporters, "I've come to greet Sheikh Hasina as a special convoy of the UN secretary-general." Asked about the UN acceptance of Bangladesh election, Martin said a UN delegation will meet Hasina and they will speak on the issue. The AL had promised to hold war crimes trial in its election manifesto. Ban during his visit in early November said they might offer assistance to hold such trial on rquest from Bangladesh. The War Crimes Facts Finding Committee wrote to Ban for UN support to set up an international tribunal to try the criminals of 1971 war of independence from Pakistan. The Sector Commanders Forum had asked the government to formally seek UN assistance for trying the war criminals. Accordingly, foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury made the request at a meeting with the UN chief at New York in April. WORK WITHOUT RETURNS Earlier in the day, when a number of AL leaders and supporters came to meet Hasina, she advised them to work for the country without thinking of returns. "You will have to work for the country and people. Work for the people without caring about what you get in return," Hasina said. "Those who were in power had indulged in corruption and looting. So the people have refused them. You will have to realise that. Otherwise, you know what the consequences will be," she told the supporters, referring to the 2001-2006 BNP-Jamaat-e-islami coalition government. She had to attend to a number of party supporters and leaders, including those who won the elections, through the day. Lawyer MA Zahir, law secretary Habibul Awal and MP-elect and Hasina's lawyer Sheikh Fazle Noor Tapas came to meet her at Sudha Sadan. Indian High Commissioner Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty saw her at night. bdnew
