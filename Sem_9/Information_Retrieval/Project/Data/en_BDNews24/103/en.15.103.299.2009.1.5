 OSLO, Jan 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Six ski teams set off on an international race to the South Pole on Sunday, nearly a century after Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen beat Britain's Robert Scott to reach it, organisers said. The teams, which include an Olympic rower and a blind Irishman, will travel 430 nautical miles across the Antarctic ice cap. Their race is billed as the first to the South Pole since the Amundsen-Scott rivalry that ended with the Norwegian's triumph in December 1911 a month before Scott reached it. Scott and his men perished in March 1912 trying to return. The fastest of the two- and three-person teams is expected to reach the Pole in about 30 days, the organisers said. The start was delayed several times by blizzard conditions that finally abated on Saturday, they said. "It had been blizzarding, but it was sunny and about minus 25 degrees (Celsius, minus 13 Fahrenheit) when they started this morning," Liz Ampairee, spokeswoman for the race, said. The competitors will camp out in tents and pull 70 kg sledges behind them. Dogs are not allowed. The route does not try to replicate those taken by Scott and Amundsen, but the racers will face the timeless dangers of frostbite, temperatures of minus 50 centigrade and a relentless headwind from the pole. Though people of several nationalities are taking part, it is hard not to see the competition mainly as British-Norwegian rivalry and a rematch of Amundsen's and Scott's historic race to the Pole, organisers said. British organiser Tony Martin told Reuters at the end of last week that he expected two Norwegians, Rune Malterud and Stian Aker, to be among the strongest. "I think they will set the pace," he said by telephone from Antarctica. The skiers include a blind Irishman, Mark Pollock, British Olympic rowing gold medallist James Cracknell and British television presenter Ben Fogle. Englishman Peter Hammond, age 62, is the oldest contestant. His teammate, Tess Burrows, age 60, is one of two women racers
