 Dhaka, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com)  Former adviser Sultana Kamal says civil society will have to "act as opposition", considering the paucity of opposition MPs in the next parliament. "The grand alliance won a landslide victory, leaving a very small opposition. Considering this, civil society will have to act as critics of the government's works," said Kamal. She was speaking at the launch of an annual report by human rights organisation Ain O Shalish Kendra. "We went through a period in the last year where there was no normal situation," said Barrister Sara Hossain presenting a summary of the 2008 report. "Basic rights of people were suspended because of emergency," she said mentioning in particular forced detentions and continued extra-judicial killings over the year. Referring to graft trials, the barrister said: "It seemed at one time that no one was beyond the law, but in the end all were above the law." She termed the Election Commission's flawless voter list a positive point that ensured a good election. Hossain said: "The people's verdict was given against war criminals through the election." She called for the creation of a probe committee within 100 days to complete the trial of war criminals in the new government's five-year tenure. The report also highlighted different problems of the tribal groups of the Chittagong Hill Tracts. Coordinator of Nijera Kori,Khushi Kabir, and human rights worker Fastina Pereira also spoke. bdnew
