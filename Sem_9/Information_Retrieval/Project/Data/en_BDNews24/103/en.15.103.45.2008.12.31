 Dhaka, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com)  The European Union's commissioner for external relations Benita Ferrero-Waldner on Wednesday urged the political parties to devise a new approach for an effective parliamentary democracy. In a statement on Bangladesh polls, the commissioner also urged the new government to carry on the reform measures initiated by the caretaker government. "I congratulate the people of Bangladesh for peaceful participation in the parliamentary elections and call for a new approach from Bangladeshi political parties to the challenges of governance in the country," Ferrero-Waldner said. "Representatives of all parties having gained seats in parliament must share the task of working together to address the challenges that Bangladesh faces. "Of ensuring that the new parliament functions in a democratic, fair and effective manner that allows enough political space for the opposition to exercise its rights. "And of sustaining the key reforms and institutional gains started by the caretaker government," the statement quoted her as saying. She also thanked the Election Commission and the interim government for their work to hold the elections.
