We have had our elections and we have voted our candidates to parliament. Almost the entire nation has voted for change and for Awami league, providing it with an electoral victory unprecedented in its scope and extent. If there is any explanation, it is that people want decisive, perhaps even revolutionary changes for the better and that the AL has somehow tapped into this urge for change. Whatever it is, the AL has been decisively voted for, now it has the parliament, will within a day or two form the government and for the next 5 years it has the job of reflecting the "will of the people". The nature, the direction and tone of that parliament and government has been already set by the Premier-to-be Sheikh Hasina in her press conference on 31 December 2007 where she spelled out the broad and general principles on how the AL intends to conduct parliament and governance for the next 5 years. The issues are all contained in the AL election manifesto and have been well publicized during the election campaign and therefore, need not be gone into here but what needs to be understood is the tenor, the trend of how AL and Sheikh Hasina view Bangladesh as it is today and as they desire to see it after 5 years of their government. In the words of Sheikh Hasina, "This win is for good governance against misrule, peace in opposition to terrorism and secular democracy as opposed to communalism. It would be a real victory for us when we would be able to establish a modern, scientific and developed Bangladesh. Countrymen would live a better life as the citizens of a peaceful nation in the South Asia region." "The landslide victory would get a real shape when rules of law, human rights and good governance will be ensured and spirit of hard earned independence will be materialised"  that in a nut-shell is the guiding principles of the soon-to-be AL government. If the AL can effectively mobilize national resources to achieve the goals set out by Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh would indeed have changed, for the better, beyond recognition, after 5 years. If, on the other hand, these goals cannot be achieved at all because of AL's detraction from its guiding principles or because of a lack of will, foresight and acumen, Bangladesh would be far worse off than it ever was. What the AL has to keep constantly in mind is that the answer to the manifold problems of Bangladesh lies in restructuring and not merely modifying every institution of both the government and the State in such a way that they reflect the stated minimum of social, political and economic equity and justice for its entire people. The AL certainly understands, if not right away then soon enough, that it is stepping into entirely new territory, metaphorically speaking and that "new territory" will invariably include working out and implementing an entirely new concept of government and governance - the AL has been provided the authority and the mandate to do so by the electorate in such a massive way as to preclude any arguments, doubts or debates about it. Therefore, existing and prevailing metaphors such as power, rule, govern must be replaced by service, cooperate, support & create. What the AL also needs to keep in mind is that it is not our politics which divide us but our economics. We have too many people with far too few resources; we have too many poor and too few rich and we have these few rich taking away too much of the resources from the too many people. Our politicians and political parties have, so far, simply used the facts and myths of history to monopolize the use and distribution of resources. This has got to change. As citizens it is our bounden responsibility to see to it that the AL is helped along its way to achieving its goals because it is a government we have elected and because it is our government  if it fails, we fail. We need to support it and nurture it and we can only do that if we all together respect whatever laws we have, keep our individual desires, needs, avarices and ambitions within bounds and work hard  without all these, no one, not the AL not the BNP, not the 300 MPs can make Bangladesh a prosperous Nation. But the AL, for its part, has also got to understand that our support is qualified by its adherence to its manifesto and its publicly announced guiding principles because it is on this that we have elected them to government. If they detract, supports will diminish; if they detract further, support will vanish and if they throw them overboard, there will be resistance, conflict and overthrow. We know that behind the opaque cloud of our ignorance and the uncertainties, the historical forces that shaped our Country, are continuing to operate. We do not know where we are going but we do know how our history has brought us to this point. However, one thing is plain - if we are to have a future, it cannot be by prolonging the past or the present. Changes have to be brought about voluntarily or changes will come about through violent social and political conflicts - that is the lesson of our history. The AL has been provided the mandate to bring about those changes voluntarily so as to preclude changes through violent social and political conflicts. We dare not look at the consequences of AL's failure to fulfill its commitments to "change". The author is the Editor of The Bangladesh Today, an English language
