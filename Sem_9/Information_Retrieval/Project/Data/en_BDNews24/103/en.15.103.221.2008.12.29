 Dhaka, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com)  Four-party alliance candidate for Dhaka-7 constituency Dhaka mayor Sadeque Hossain Khoka on Monday said many could not cast their votes due to a discrepancy between national ID cards and voter slip numbers. He said he was worried about the outcome of the voting in the general elections. "Therefore, I am worried about the outcome," he said after visiting the Sohrawardy College Centre at Laxibazar in Dhaka-7 constituency. Khoka cast his vote at the Bangladesh Bank Colony centre in Dhanmondi at 1:15pm. "I have visited the centres and have not seen any disruptions," observed the mayor. He said victory or loss would be determined after votes were counted. bdnews2
