<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com) - The BNP, as opposition, will extend all cooperation to the Awami League-led government, not only in constructive activities but also in bringing structural changes, a senior MP-elect of the opposition said on Sunday. "The BNP saw divisions in the last two years in the name of 'reforms'," Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury told reporters at his office in the city. "We were not prepared for election in the given situation, but we participated for the sake of restoring democracy, establishing people's fundamental rights and bidding goodbye to the unconstitutional and illegal government," "As opposition, we'll support all the constructive activities of the government. If convinced through debate, we'll even cooperate if the government wants to bring any structural changes," said Chowdhury. However, BNP will not compromise with anyone on issues such as Islam as the state religion, Salahuddin said. The BNP will support government's initiatives in preventing corruption and terrorism, on food production and boosting export, he said. But BNP will not support the creation of a 'South Asian taskforce against terrorism', which the AL promised in its electoral manifesto, said the BNP leader. On the much-talked-about trial of war criminals, he said, "We don't have any objection in trying war criminals, as we don't have any war criminals among us." "If they identify anyone as a war criminal they can hold trial," said Salahuddin. He said the elected BNP MPs could not take their oaths on Sunday, as they were not in Dhaka. "A meeting of newly elected MPs will be held on January 7 at chairperson Khaleda Zia's Gulshan office, where a decision regarding their taking oath will be decided," Salahuddin said. He alleged the BNP-led four-party alliance was forcibly defeated in the ninth general election on Dec. 29. "The voter roll that the Election Commission provided us and the voter roll provided to the polling officers were not identical," he alleged. "If the two voter rolls are compared, then it will be clear whether we lost fairly in the election or were defeated through other means," he said. He, however, complied with the election result and urged all nationalist forces to be united. "We want to support the government's constructive activities as opposition," he said. Salahuddin added that BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia had taken up reform initiatives in the party from grassroots level. Asked about BNP's erstwhile 'reformists', he said "those who had drawn the line of divide between the party" had been hatching plots. "I believe they will regret their activities some day," he observed. He also claimed BNP leaders and supporters suffered the most after 1/11. "Even after that we are representing three crore voters," said Salahuddin. bdnews
