 LONDON, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United winger Cristiano Ronaldo said on Thursday he felt at home in England and that continued speculation linking him with a move to Real Madrid was wrong. "There's always speculation, not just about me but about the future of players all around the world," Ronaldo said in an interview published on Manchester United's official website (www.manutd.com). "People were speaking about me this summer but that was normal because of what I did during the season. What people are saying now (recent speculation about an agreement with Real Madrid) is not true. "Who says that is a liar because I am happy at the club, I want to stay here. I feel at home here. I feel very happy here." Ronaldo scored 42 goals in all competitions for United last season as they won the Premier League and Champions League titles and he was subsequently named European Footballer of the Year. His outstanding form led Real Madrid to pursue him, while a Real director was quoted as saying last month that there was an agreement in place to sign the 23-year-old Portuguese winger at the end of this season. That was later denied by Real president Ramon Calderon who told Real's website (www.realmadrid.com): "It is absolutely false that there is any agreement with Manchester United on that subject.
