<TITLE> Droylsden fail in appeal against FA Cup expulsion </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The FA said on Wednesday that minor league Droylsden's appeal against their expulsion from the FA Cup had failed and confirmed that Chesterfield would take their place to play Ipswich Town in the third round on Saturday. Droylsden, who play in the Conference North, two divisions below the Football League, beat League Two (fourth division) side Chesterfield 2-1 in a replay last week but defender Sean Newton, who scored both goals, played despite being suspended. The FA threw Droylsden out of the competition on Monday and said on Wednesday that its Protest Sub-Committee had dismissed the north-west club's appeal. The decision brings to an end the tie's long-running saga that included two abandonments - due to fog and floodlight failure - a controversial 2-2 draw that included a "gifted goal" to make amends for Chesterfield scoring when they had been given possession after treatment for one of their players, and the 2-1 replay win for Droylsden
