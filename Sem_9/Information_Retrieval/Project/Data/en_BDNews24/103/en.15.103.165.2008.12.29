 Dhaka, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com)  A wintry morning turned into the first sunny day for weeks as voters across Bangladesh voted peacefully from 8am to 4pm Monday in 299 constituencies, hoping for a peaceful return to democracy after almost two years of emergency rule. Election chief ATM Shamsul Huda says the first four to six hours of polling saw some 50 percent of votes cast in centres visited up to Monday afternoon. "The presiding officers of the centres I visited said, about 50 per cent votes have been cast by 12:50 pm and 70 per cent in some cases," he told reporters just before 2pm. Voicing hopes that the outcome would be accepted by all, chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed cast his vote looking "to a power handover soon". Huda had earlier said he was hoping for a turnout as high as 75 per cent as he came out casting his vote at a school in the capital. Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina, flanked by sister Sheikh Rehana, was one of the early voters to arrive at Dhanmondi's City College centre at 8:30am and said she was confident of winning but voiced concern over polls-eve irregularities. BNP chief Khaleda Zia, as she cast her ballot at Dhaka Cantonment just after noon, said she would accept the results of a fair vote. Army chief Gen Moeen U Ahmed took some pride in being able to complete the 81 million-strong national ID card roll "in just 11 months" after voting and posing for photos at the same Cantonment centre at 11:40pm. Early reports from 299 constituencies across Bangladesh say the polling has generally been peaceful, but there has been some turmoil in some cases resulting from the newly-introduced photo identity cards. bdnews24.com correspondent Moinul Hoque Chowdhury says Huda has been trying to encourage "the young, new and the first-time voters". In Dhaka, some young voters carrying ID cards complained that their names were not found on the voters' list. Our correspondent says the CEC has ordered an immediate investigation into the matter. In one glaring example, ID card carrying pensioner Serajul Islam, 71, failed to find his name on the roll in a Dhanmondi centre in the capital. Son Serajus Saleheen, a multinational executive, said all members of the family filled up the forms together. "He's waited since 6am to vote," said Saleheen, who however was enrolled and could vote. Saleheen said the presiding officer told him at 1:30pm that the centre had received "at least 50 such complaints so far". A voter turnout of 75 per cent or more would reflect a trend for high turnout seen in Bangladesh's immediate past two elections. In 2001, 75.59 percent voted, with 74.37 percent found valid. In 1996, the turnout was 75.60 percent, with validity given to 74.81 percent. The lowest ever turnout in Bangladesh was recorded in the highly controversial Feb 15 1996 pollsat just 26.74 percent. As usual, Election Day has been a government holiday, with voters queuing up at polling centres from early morning, and later spilling out onto the streets that were pleasantly free of traffic. "Polling will continue up to 4pm, uninterrupted," Huda told bdnews24.com. The CEC in a televised speech on Sunday evening assured the nation of all necessary preparations for a free and fair election, inviting all to apply their voting rights without fear. "I'm inviting all voters, regardless of political differences, to go to polling centres taking the opportunity of the secure environment to cast their invaluable votes," the CEC said. This was Bangladesh's 9th parliamentary election since independence, and the first national vote in seven years. BNP chief and two-time former prime minister Khaleda Zia stepped down at the end of her five-year term on Oct. 28, 2006. Iajuddin Ahmed was sworn in next day as head of a caretaker government. But the Jan. 22, 2007 general election was postponed amid allegations by the Awami League and its allies that BNP had stacked the Election Commission with partisans and stuffed the voter rolls with 1.4 crore fake names. A state of emergency was imposed on Jan. 11, with certain fundamental rights suspended and a nighttime curfew imoposed. President Iajuddin Ahmed then resigned as the head of the caretaker government entrusted to run the polls. A military-installed interim government headed by Fakhruddin Ahmed lifted the state of emergency on Dec. 17. Noakhali-1 constituency will hold its poll on Jan. 12, deferred after the death of Awami League-led grand alliance candidate Nurul Islam.
