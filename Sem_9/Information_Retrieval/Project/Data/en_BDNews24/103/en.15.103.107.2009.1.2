 MUMBAI, Jan 02(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India slashed its main interest rates by 1 percentage point each on Friday and took a series of steps to bring more funds into the country to boost flagging economic growth amid a global slowdown. While the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cut its key lending rate for the fourth time in as many months to an 8-1/2-year low of 5.5 percent, the government more than doubled the amount of foreign investment allowed in corporate bonds and said it would infuse more capital into state-run banks. (For fiscal measures, click here) The RBI said the fundamentals of the economy were strong but there was evidence of economic activity slowing down. "Once the crisis is behind us, and calm and confidence are restored in the global markets, economic activity in India would recover sharply," it said. "But a period of painful adjustment is inevitable." The benchmark 10-year bond yield tumbled 29 basis points after the rate decision to 5.10 percent. The RBI also lowered its reverse repo rate, or the rate at which it mops up surplus cash from banks, by 100 basis points to 4 percent. Both reductions are effective immediately. It also announced a reduction in the cash reserve ratio, or the proportion of deposits that banks must keep with it, by 50 basis points to 5 percent. The cash reserve ratio cut, which takes effect from Jan. 17, will release 200 billion rupees ($4.1 billion) into the banking system. The RBI noted exports and industrial output have contracted, investment demand has decelerated and business confidence has been dented. The $1 trillion economy has expanded at an average rate of 9 percent or more for three years, but many economists expect growth to slow to about 7 percent for the current year ending March. A key manufacturing index contracted again in December and companies cut jobs to reduce costs as new orders fell sharply and spare capacity at factories rose, indicating shrinking activity.
