<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com)  Two late-strikes from Kalu Johnson helped Farashganj Sporting Club crush Rahmatganj MFS 3-1 in the Citycell B. League encounter at Bangabandhu National Stadium on Thursday. Apart from Kalu's two goals, Kabir Hossain struck the other for Rahmatganj while Idris Kasirye scored the lone goal for Rahmatganj MFS after the B. League resumed following a six-day break for the national elections. With the fourth win in 12 matches, Farashganj climbed up to the sixth position from eighth with 16 while Rahmatganj remained on 14 points playing a match less. Captain Kabir gave Farashganj a 16-minute lead converting a spot kick after referee Tayed Hasan awarded a penalty shot to the winners when Rahmatganj defender Shipon brought Kalu down in the danger zone. After going down, Rahmatganj stepped up the attack, but failed to yield any scoring chance before Kubeya Dominic rattled Rahmatganj crossbar with a header in the 33rd minute. Two minutes later, Rahmatganj came close to equalising the margin with an Idris placing shot narrowly going over the Farashganj crossbar. After resumption, both sides battled equally with the ball mostly concentrated in the midfield, but the exciting last four minutes saw three goals scored and Farashganj left the field with their head high. Felix Onyeokora whipped a cross for Idris, who rose high to head from 10 yards home in the 86th minute to level the Rahmatganj margin, but Kalu struck twice in last three minutes to frustrate Rahmatganj. Kalu with a solo effort drove a powerful volley inside the box to put Farahganj ahead again in the 87th minute before he sealed the match one minute from time, taking a fumble of Rahmatganj goalkeeper Mohammad Ali. bd
