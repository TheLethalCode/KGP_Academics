 Dhaka, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com)  Three independent winners, the Liberal Democratic Party chief and an Awami League leader were administered oath to office on Sunday by speaker Jamiruddin Sircar. The five who took oath are LDP president Oli Ahmed, Awami League's Ranjit Kumar Roy (Jessore-4) who was out of Dhaka Saturday, Kabirul Huq Biswas (Norail-1), Abdul Baten (Tangail-6) and Fazlul Azim (Noakhali-6). AL's Ranjit could not make it to the capital for Saturday's swearing-in that saw Sheikh Hasina and other grand alliance winners complete the formalities. Of the independent candidates sworn in Sunday, apart from Fazlul Azim, the other two went to polls after failing to get nominations from AL. They arrived to take aoths donning the trademark Mujib Coatan attire worn by AL adherents after independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Former MP Fazlul Azim became an independent candidate after failing to get nomination from BNP. BNP and its allies in the four-party combine did not take their oaths, as scheduled Sunday. On Saturday, elected MPs of Awami League, Jatiya Party, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal and Workers Party of Bangladesh took oath. The swearing in was done at the 'Oath Room' of the parliament building and the programme was conducted by Asfaq Hamid, secretary of the parliament Secretariat. Oli later dismissed chances of going back to BNP, the party he had helped come into being. "I am the only man who represents the people outside the two parties in parliament. People voted for me and, in parliament, I shall express the wishes and hopes of the common people." "There is no chance of going back to BNP," said Fazlul Azim, and repeated Oli Ahmed's desire to be the voice of the common people. AL got absolute majority by winning 230 seats in the Dec. 29 parliamentary election. JP, JSD and Worker's Party, allies of AL in the grand alliance, got 27, three and two seats respectively, out of the 299 seats. The four-party alliance bagged 32 seats, with BNP 29 and Jamaat-e-Islami and Bangladesh Jatiya Party two and one seats respectively. The Election Commission gazetted the results on Thursday. bdnews24
