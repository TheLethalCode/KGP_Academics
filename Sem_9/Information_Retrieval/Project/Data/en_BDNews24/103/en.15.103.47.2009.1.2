 Dhaka, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com)  Francesc Vendrell, head of UN secretary-general's panel on the parliamentary elections, on Friday said the Dec. 29 polls were "peaceful and credible". After his meeting with incoming prime minister Sheikh Hasina, Vendrell hoped there would be no "provocation" on the elections from anyone and the new government would take office soon. He seems to be the last international figure to term the general elections "credible", as all the international observers have said the polls have been "fair". Head of the losing BNP, Khaleda Zia, earlier rejected the results saying the those were tailored and unacceptable. "We are not observing elections. International and domestic observers have told us that the elections seem to have been held in a peaceful climate and... the elections have been credible," Vendrell told reporters following the meeting at Sudha Sadan, Hasina's home. "So we are pleased, this is the situation. We hope in future days there will be no provocation and there will be a climate of quiet, allowing the new parliament to meet as soon as possible to form a government and then to proceed down the road of rebuilding this country," said the UN panel head. Replying to a question on the possible UN assistance for war crimes trial, Vendrell said, "If the new government of Bangladesh requests the help of the UN, we will look into it. We had similar requests in the past". He said he could not anticipate the requests of Bangladesh government. The other panel members Nepal's chief election commissioner Bhojraj Pokhrel and deputy director of UN's electoral assistance division Aracelly Santana were also present at the meeting. The UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon during his Nov. 1 visit in Dhaka announced that a high-powered panel would be sent to Bangladesh to weigh the political situation for the general elections. bd
