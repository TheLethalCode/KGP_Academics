 Dhaka, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Chhatra League, the student front of Awami League that won a landslide Awami in Monday's general election, are allegedly harassing students at the dormitories of the Dhaka University. Its supporters have assaulted a number of students, stormed a number of rooms of students of rival bodies, occupied them and looted valuables. Shortly after the victory, AL president Sheikh Hasina directed the BCL to ensure peaceful coexistence on the university campuses, but many allege the BCL activists are not listening. Most of the supporters of Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal and Islami Chhatra Shibir, students wings of BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami, have left dormitories shortly after confirmation of their parental bodies' defeat in the election in a bid to avoid backlash from BCL supporters. The BCL supporters had done the same thing after BNP-Jamaat alliance's victory in 2001 election. Residents of a number of dormitories have alleged that the BCL supporters have put a number of rooms, where the JCD and the Shibir men had been living, under lock and key. There are 12 halls for male students that are mainly facing the BCL wrath. The BCL supporters have allegedly looted two computers from room 512 of Kabi Jasimuddin Hall. They also beat a resident, Abul Kalam Azad of mass communication and journalism and forced him out of the hall. A number of rooms of Jasimuddin Hall, Sergeant Johurul Haq Hall, Salimullah Hall, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Hall, President Ziur Rahman Hall, Muhsin Hall, Suryasen Hall and five other dormitories were locked allegedly to occupy those to accommodate BCL loyalists. The BCL men also allegedly stormed two Salimullah Hall rooms of university correspondents of pro-Jamaat newspapers Dainik Nayadiganta and Dainik Sangram and looted their valuables. The BCL men are allegedly guarding the entrances to the dormitories and keeping an eye on movements of residents. "Residents are being interrogated while getting in and out of the dormitories by the BCL men," a resident said, requesting anonymity. "They are asking the student questions like 'which subject are you studying?', 'are you involved in JCD or Shibir politics?', 'Have you cast votes for boat?'" the student said. The BCL president, Mahmud Hasan Ripon, on Wednesday told bdnews24.com that punitive measures would be taken against those who have defied Hasina's orders. bdnews24.
