<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 03 (bdnews24.com)Ekattorer Ghatok Dalal Nirmul Committee (committee to eliminate killers and collaborators of 1971) says it does not see any role of the United Nations when it comes to trying the 1971 war criminals. "Those who want to try war criminals by forming tribunals under the UN are either ignoring 'International Crimes (Tribunal) Act-1973', or did not study the Act," the committee said in a statement Saturday. "Or they are saying this on purpose to create complexities as well as obstacles in trying them finally," it said. The Act, which vests power in Bangladesh government to form tribunals to try war criminals, was formulated in 1973 during the tenure of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman-led government, the statement said. The United Nations and its organs dealing with human rights and war crimes can, at most, send monitors to the trial, it said. In another development, the Forum for Secular Bangladesh has demanded ban on religion-based politics pursued by the Jamaat-e-Islami and its associate bodies. It said Saturday the government must act to "eliminate militancy, fundamentalism and communalism". The Forum issued the statement after a joint meeting of its working committee and advisory council. Justice Golam Rabbani chaired the meeting. Those who attended included retired lieutenant colonel Abu Osman Chowdhury, writers Syed Shamsul Huq and Shahriar Kabir. bdne
