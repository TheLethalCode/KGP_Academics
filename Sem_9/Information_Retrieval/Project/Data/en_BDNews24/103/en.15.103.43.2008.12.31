 Dhaka, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com)  In her first public reaction after the national election BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia thanked the chief election commissioner for a "well stage-managed election". "After Monday's polls, the Election Commission only announced a staged result set earlier," Khaleda said at a midnight press briefing after an emergency meeting of the BNP national standing committee. She also alleged that vote rigging was "unprecedented" After the four-party's catastrophic losses in the polls, Khaleda chaired an emergency meeting of the party's highest policymaking body from 7pm to 11:30pm. "The results of the staged election are not acceptable to BNP," Khaleda told reporters after the meeting. Asked whether she was "rejecting" the results, the BNP chief did not answer directly, replying instead: "You can understand what is meant by 'unacceptable'." "We will talk about the issue later." Her speech was very brief and the two-time former prime minister appeared tired. She mentioned the unprecedented loss of party strongholds and fall of heavyweights as reasons to doubt the polls results. Khaleda pointed out that election officials had announced 40 to 50 percent voter turnout by noon on polling day, but, she claimed, "during the rest of the day voting centres were almost vacant". The results announced showed 90 percent of votes cast, she said. "How did it happen?" Khaleda asked, before alleging that there had been "unprecedented vote rigging". She said her party and its allies had specific proof of rigging, which they would present after further meetings over the next few days. Whether BNP and its allies would go for legal steps, she said: "We will decide later in our meetings, and will let you know." She gave the same answer when asked if elected members of her four-party alliance would be sworn into parliament. Prior to the meeting of the 11-strong committee, Khaleda appeared emotional as she waved at a few hundred supporters from the second floor of the office around 6:45pm, witnesses said. She stood there in silence for sometime as party supporters shouted slogans. The meeting was the first organisational move after the party's defeat in Monday's general elections. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, committee members Khandker Mosharraf Hossain, RA Ghani, Chowdhury Tanvir Ahmed Siddiqui, Khandker Mahbub Uddin Ahmad and M Shamsul Islam attended the meeting at the chairperson's Gulshan office. Along with former minister Mirza Abbas, former MP Akhtaruzzaman and ex-state minister Amanullah Aman, all were present at the press briefing. bdnews24.c
