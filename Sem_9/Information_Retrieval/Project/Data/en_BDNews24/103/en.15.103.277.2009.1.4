 Sumon Mahbub, bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Jan. 4 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League president Sheikh Hasina on Sunday visited presidium member Zillur Rahman at his home in a clear expression of admiration and respect for the veteran who helmed the party through the post-Jan. 11, 2007 political crisis. Hasina, the prime-minister-in-waiting, and younger sister, Rehana, carried flowers and sweets for Zillur, who will be Bangladesh's next head of state, and his daughter Moina in the afternoon. Moina greeted them in the lobby outside their apartment at Ivy Concord at Gulshan. Hasina hugged Moina, exchanged greetings and asked about her elder sister Tania's whereabouts. "This is Sheikh Hasina's personal visit to Zillur Rahman and his family. There is no possibility of their discussing any political issues here," Hasina's private secretary Aulad Hossain said to the reporters waiting outside. An AL parliamentary party meeting on Saturday elected Hasina leader of the parliament and Zillur Rahman, her deputy. The grand alliance leader Hasina said in a post-meeting press briefing, "Though elected a deputy leader in the parliament, Zillur Rahman will be elected president when the time is ripe." Asked about the cabinet size and who might be invited to form it, Hasina said, "I won't tell you anything now." Zillur acted as the AL president after Hasina was detained in 2007. bdnews
