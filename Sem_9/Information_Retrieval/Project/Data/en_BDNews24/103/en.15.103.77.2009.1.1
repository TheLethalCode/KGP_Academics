<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission has said it is looking to have an effective relationship with the incoming Awami league-led government. "We hope the elected government will be interested in curbing corruption," the director general (administration), Colonel Hanif Iqbal, said at a regular media briefing at the ACC office on Thursday. Asked whether the cases against Awami League MP-elects would continue, he said, "The commission has not hinted at any change in its policy." When asked whether the cases against AL president prime minister-elect Sheikh Hasina would be pursued any longer, Col Hanif said, "I don't know anything about this." Referring to the Truth Commission chairman Habibur Rahman Khan's comment on Wednesday about the ACC, he alleged Khan had wittingly spoken ill of the ACC. "Half the cases that came to the Truth Commission from the Anticorruption Commission suffer from an unclear investigation," Khan had commented. Col Hanif said, "Since the Truth Commission did not get a chance to hear from the complainants and the defendants, it can be assumed that they have taken decisions on unclear ideas on the basis of one-sided statements." Commenting on whether the ACC liked to harass people , Col Hanif said, "A few unexpected comments were made about a few cases of the commission." "None asked for any information and neither the ACC was given any chance to give a statement about these cases." He also said Truth Commission has made decisions only hearing the applicants. bdnews24
