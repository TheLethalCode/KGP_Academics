 Dhaka, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com)  Skipper Mohammad Ashraful has said he is impressed with Bangladesh's performance in the first Test against Sri Lanka. "I will say the overall performance was pretty well and it could have been better," Ashraful said at a post-match conference at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Wednesday. "Our bowlers bowled well in the first innings, but some decisions went against us that allowed the opponents to post a good total on the board. We knew we did not bat well in the first innings, but I will say we played pretty well throughout the game." Bangladesh suffered a 107-run defeat despite posting their fourth innings highest of 413 on the final day of the match after the visitors set the hosts to chase an improbable target of 521 to win the match. "Our target was to play session by session on the final day and perform better. We never thought of the outcome," said Ashraful, who converted his overnight score of 70 to 101, his fifth Test hundred and fourth against Sri Lanka. Two hundred-run partnerships raised the glimpse of setting a new record in Test history as Bangladesh needed to break the West Indies' most-run chase record of 418 against Australia to win the match. Ashraful along with Shakib Al Hasan put on 112 runs for the sixth wicket while Shakib pairing with Mushfiqur Rahim added another 111 runs for the seventh wicket, eclipsing Bangladesh's previous seventh-wicket best of 94. Ashraful believed there was a chance to win the match if he or Shakib could manage to stay on to the end. "It was possible as it is a game of cricket. It could have been different if Shakib and I could leave the day's first session behind, but unfortunately I got out," said the youngest Test centurion, praising the knocks of Shakib and Mushfiqur. Asked whether he should lead his side from the front with such knock, the Bangladesh skipper said, "Sure, I always try. From the experience of my eight-year cricket career, I think I can't do well regularly because my game plan has not been the same." Sri Lankan skipper Mahela Jayawardene said he never thought of losing the match and that the performance of Bangladesh was not unusual at all to them. "You know in the last couple of Test matches they (Bangladesh) were very close to win against New Zealand and probably one against South Africa as well. So we knew they are capable of doing so," said Jayawardene, who looked tense during Bangladesh's two hundred-run partnerships. "The way they played, I mean they batted very well. So credit should go to them. But only good thing is that we had 521 runs behind us and we knew we have to be patient, bowl in the good areas and create opportunities. "It was big effort from our bowlers on a very slow wicket towards the end. So it's a good Test match." Jayawardene said they knew they would not be able to get Bangladesh out for 150 or 200 in the second innings on a wicket like that which was really good to bat on. That's why they continued to bat in the second innings to make sure they were in a very comfortable position, he added. The Sri Lankan skipper also praised the efforts Bangladesh batsman. "We got five sessions to get them out. They batted very well, specially the middle order and the lower middle order. Ashraful, Shakib and Rahim at the end batted very well and credit to them." b
