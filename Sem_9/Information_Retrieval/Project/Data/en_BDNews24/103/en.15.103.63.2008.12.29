Unification Minister Kim Ha-joong told reporters: "I think the North Korean leadership is stable," the South's Yonhap news agency said. The North's state media has issued several reports in recent months saying Kim went on field guidance visits to military units, factories and farms. Speculation about Kim's health reached a peak in September when he did not appear at a triumphal military parade to mark the 60th anniversary of the founding of the state by his father Kim Il-sung, which the state calls its "eternal president."
