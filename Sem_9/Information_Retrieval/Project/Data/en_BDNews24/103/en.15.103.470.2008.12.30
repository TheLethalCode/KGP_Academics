 Rohan Ziad bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com) It may have taken hours standing in line to cast a vote, being commented on much of the time, but that didn't stop Bangladesh's Hijra community or eunuchs from exercising their long-awaited franchise. Monday's national election, the first in seven years, was a red letter day as they were able to vote as citizens in their own identity. A new electoral code secured the votes of the transsexuals in their own right, along with that of river gypsies and the prison population, for the first time in the country's history. "I can't say in words how happy I am today," Nayan Hijra, told bdnews24.com coming out from a polling centre in the capital's Shyampur area. It gave her a feeling of belonging as a true citizen of the country where being mocked or else ignored is a common phenomenon. But there is no reason to believe those troubles past, as many of Nayan's community complained of discrimination at polling centres. "In a democracy everybody should be treated equally, but where is that to be seen?" Komola, a middle-aged eunuch asks at a polling centre in Juraeen. They were treated as if they were "infectious" by fellow voters as well as poll officials, she told bdnews24.com. Komola said she thinks that they should be put in a separate line. But the younger Hijras accompanying her protest. "We are a part of this society, not separate," said Shyamoli who appeared to be very much confident of her identity. Pushpo, in her twenties, has high hopes that in coming days all their rights will be recognised. "The good days have started with us becoming voters." But her elders don't all agree. The older transsexuals believe that voting right or no, things will not change. "Every time as polls draw near, leaders came to us in the past with their promises and enlisted us eunuchs as 'women voters'," said Shumona, who is in her sixties. "Some of us despite the mockery went to vote those times, but nothing changed." Taken to the 'Hijra slum' in Wari where only the eunuchs live, this correspondent had to face embarrassing as well as awkward questions from other locals, illustrating how society still views these people held in isolation. Leaving the slum, an aged man heading towards the nearby mosque, asked: "Youngman you look and sound like an educated person; what were you doing over there?" The opinion of another local came immediately: "Maybe he had some business over there". In the face of such common attitudes, Shumona did not go to vote this time believing it would bring no good for her or her community. But still the younger generation are hopeful that a change is on its way. "The older ones don't understand that you cannot expect everything in one shot," says teenage Hijra Pollob. "But we are hopeful about a good start," he said. bdne
