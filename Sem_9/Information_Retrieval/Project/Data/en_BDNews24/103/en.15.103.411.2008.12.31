 Dhaka, Dec 31 (bdews24.com)  Britain on Wednesday said Bangladeshi people could be proud of holding the ninth parliamentary polls in a "free, fair and peaceful" way. In a statement, the UK's secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs David Miliband also urged the ruling party and the opposition to work together for nation building, shunning politics of confrontation and violence. "The Election Commission, caretaker government and observers have worked hard to create conditions in which free, fair and peaceful elections can take place. "The people of Bangladesh have spoken in huge numbers and they can be proud of the manner in which the elections were conducted," Miliband said in a statement released by the local British high commission. "This is a historic moment for Bangladesh to cast aside the politics of confrontation and violence, in favour of inclusive and consensual democracy," he added. Terming Britain as Bangladesh's friend, he said, "We urge the next government and opposition to work together to meet the expectations of the people in the days and years to come." bd
