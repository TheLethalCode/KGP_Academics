 Chandpur, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com)  The car of ASM Ahsanul Huq Milon, the four-party alliance candidate for Chandpur-1 and former state minister for education, was vandalised on Monday during polling, police said. The incident happened at 10am when the candidate was going to Narayanpur Government Primary School voting centre from Kashimpur. "No one was wounded in the attack on Milon's car," said police superintendent Krishnapada Ray. "No one has been arrested either." "The attack was aimed to kill me," alleged Milon. Meanwhile, at least nine people were wounded over establishment of authority over a voting centre in Madaripur and Shariatpur. Five persons were wounded in Madaripur -1 and four in Madaripur-2 due to clashes between supporters of the Awami League-led grand alliance and the four-party alliance headed by BNP. Eight of the wounded were admitted to the Shibchar Hospital while one critically wounded has been sent to Dhaka. Shibchar Police Station officer in charge M A Jalil said the matter had been resolved and the situation was now under control. There have been reports of clashes between supporters of the two major alliances in Habiganj. In Shariatpr-2, when grand alliance candidate entered the voting centre and asked the voters to vote for boat, the symbol of AL, he was prevented by the agent of BNP candidate Shafiqur Rahman. As a result, skirmishes broke and three persons were seriously wounded. They are now in Shariatpur Sadar Hospital. Police superintendent Shahriar Rahman said, "This was a minor clash and no major fight broke out." bdnews24.com/correspon
