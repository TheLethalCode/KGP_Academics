<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Jan 3(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said on Saturday he hoped sense would prevail in Pakistan over tackling militancy and reiterated a demand that Islamabad hand over those suspected of plotting the deadly attacks in Mumbai. "We are committed to rooting out terrorism and we sincerely hope that better sense will prevail with Pakistan," Singh told reporters in Shillong. Faced with global pressure to act, Pakistan launched raids on militants on its soil after the Mumbai attacks in November. But India said Islamabad was not sincere and needed to do more. New Delhi wants Pakistan to dismantle what it says are camps training militants to attack India, and extradite at least 40 suspects. Pakistan denies fomenting trouble in India and says it would act if India provided credible evidence. Islamabad has denied any wrongdoing in the Mumbai attacks which it blamed on "non state actors". "The leadership of Pakistan would recognise...the demand from all civilised territories that the perpetrators must be brought to book," Singh said. "We hope that these criminals will be handed over to us to face trial in our country." India says it is preparing a dossier of evidence that it will share with "friendly countries" which lost citizens when 10 Muslim gunmen rampaged through some of Mumbai's landmarks with automatic guns and grenades, killing 179 people. Home Minister P. Chidambaram met United States Ambassador to India David Mulford on Saturday, a senior U.S. embassy official in New Delhi said, a meeting that came in the backdrop of an FBI team arriving in India to help with the Mumbai investigations.
