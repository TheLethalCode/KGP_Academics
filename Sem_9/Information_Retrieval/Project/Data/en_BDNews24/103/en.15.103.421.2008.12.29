 Dhaka, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com) - Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed has called on the nation to cast its vote on Monday to bring an elected government to power for the next five years, saying his two-year caretaker government was on the threshold of fulfilling its commitment. "By the grace of God and with your cooperation, we're now at the end of meeting our promises. The nation is going to vote tomorrow," the CA said in a televised speech to the nation on the eve of the 9th Jatiya Sangsad election. "Let us cast our votes after giving a deep thought to it before taking decision. We'll have to remember that we're going to take a decision for the next five years with a one-day verdict." The CA said he would also cast his vote on Monday, "not as the chief adviser, but in an even more important role - a common citizen". "We must not commit any mistakes in making our choices. Let us unite and participate in the healthy democratic process." State-run Bangladesh Television and Bangladesh Betar aired the speech at 8:30pm. About the photo voter roll, Fakhruddin said it was a great treasure for the nation and would protect the main spirit of democracy - "one man one vote". The former Bangladesh Bank governor expressed his hope that the ninth parliamentary election will be considered as an exemplary one, not only in the country, but also in the international arena. "And for this the role of the political parties will be the most important part," he observed in his last speech before the polls. "All hope that [political parties] will cooperate with one another after the election, avoiding hostility and conflict. Mutual respect, solidarity and flexibility are among the most needed attitudes," the CA said. The CA said the people of the country must remember the circumstances in which his government had taken over and how they worked for the main goal of holding a free, fair and credible election. Fakhruddin expressed his hope that all the contesting political parties would comply with the election results. He recounted the extraordinary two years of his caretaker government's tenure, covering reforms such as separation of judiciary, steps fighting corruption, strengthening accountability in governance and strengthening the local government. The CA also mentioned initiatives taken by his government to support agriculture, power and utility services. The country has seen 6.2 percent GDP growth, while per capita income has increases to $600 from $520 while export earning increased by 16 per cent, the chief adviser said. He said law and order of the country had been better in the last two years than any other period in the past. Citing reverses in the last two years, including natural calamities, Cyclone Sidr, global economic crises, inflation in the international markets hiking prices of fuels and grains, Fakhruddin said these put the country's economy and food safety under threat. "Despite all these adversaries, we did not compromise with our responsibility of giving democracy back to the nation," said the interim governmenthead. "We've always tried to discharge our duties properly." bdn
