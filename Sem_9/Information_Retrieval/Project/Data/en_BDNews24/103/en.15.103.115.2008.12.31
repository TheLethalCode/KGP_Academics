 PORT BLAIR, India (Reuters) - Indian authorities said on Monday they still hope to find survivors among about 300 men, mainly Bangladeshis, missing near remote islands in the Bay of Bengal, although the navy said it had recovered two more bodies. Two Indian navy ships have joined coastguard vessels searching for the missing men, many of whom are feared to have drowned, officials said. "We are looking for them in all possible places near the south of Little Andaman as we think there could be more survivors," Andamans defense spokesman Mannu Virk told Reuters in Port Blair, the capital of Andaman and Nicobar islands. "We will continue our search and rescue operation in all the islands," he said.

Coastguard officials said on Sunday 88 men from an original group of 412 had been rescued from a boat found near Little Andaman island, about 90 km (55 miles) south of Port Blair. On Monday they put the number of survivors at 102. Two more bodies were found on Monday, taking to seven the number recovered since the boat was discovered on Thursday. Survivors told authorities that seven others had died at sea and their bodies had been dumped overboard. India's coastguard is investigating how the men drifted into Indian waters, and how the survivors came to be in one boat.
