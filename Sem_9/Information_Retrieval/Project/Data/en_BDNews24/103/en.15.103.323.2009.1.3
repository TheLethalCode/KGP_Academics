 Dhaka, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com)  Police on Friday night simultaneously raided nine halls of residence of Dhaka University in the wake of factional fight between pro-Awami League student organisation Bangladesh Chhatra League. A huge contingent of police, and detectives started the raids at the nine of the 12 male dormitories at around midnight. The raid continued through to 1:15am on Saturday with no arrests or recovery of arms, a senior police official said on condition that he not be named. Earlier, proctor Prof. AK Firoz Ahmed said, "The law-enforcement agencies feel the need of taking measures in the wake of some incidents on the campus in the last few days." The university authorities are cooperating with the security agencies, he added. Police searched for illegal arms and non-students living in the halls, Prof. Firoz said. Witnesses said police were entering every room and checking ID cards. On Friday noon, police picked up two BCL activists from Muktijoddha Ziaur Rahman Hall on charges of rioting. Three had been reportedly injured on Thursday while the two belligerent BCL factions fought. Police also retrieved 10 improvised bombs after a search of the hall on Jan. 1. In 2001, following BNP's phenomenal emergence as the national polls winners, leaders and activists of Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, its student front, had chased BCL adherents out of the DU halls. With AL winning the recent national polls, some scattered untoward incidents occurred on the DU campus, which the CL leaders and activists said they were trying to curb effectively. A BCL leader at Sergeant Johurul Haq Hall was stabbed severely just two days ahead of the election by unidentified assailants. bdnews24.
