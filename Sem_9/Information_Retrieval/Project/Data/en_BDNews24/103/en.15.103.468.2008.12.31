Silva will be the second Latin American coach of Bangladesh after Argentine coach Diego Andres Cruciani, who coached Bangladesh from August 2005 to Sept 2006. He played club football in Brazil and Israel from 1979 to 1996 before taking charge of Israel club Macabi Holon in 1996. He also coached clubs in Malta, UAE, Brazil, Netherlands and Denmark. Bangladesh's first foreign coach was Germany's Werner Bekelhoft in 1978.
