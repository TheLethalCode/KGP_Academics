 Dhaka, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com)  The four-party alliance headed by BNP brought allegations of irregularities in Monday's general election, with early results showing the rival Awami League-led grand alliance leading in many of the 299 seats. A delegation of mid-level leaders from BNP and its ally Jamaat-e-Islami met with the chief election commissioner at around 9:30pm. "We have been saying that the administration is working in favour of the grand alliance. Our apprehension has proved right," Mirza Abbas told reporters after emerging from the meeting at the Election Commission Secretariat. "The commission could not take proper measures to [address the issues]," he said. Asked what allegations they had made to the EC, Abbas said: "The commission knows it well." BNP's Sahabuddin Laltu, Jamaat's leader Abdul Kader Mollah and Jashim Uddin Sarker were also on the delegation. bdnew
