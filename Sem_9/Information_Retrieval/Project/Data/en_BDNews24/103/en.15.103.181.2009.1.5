<TITLE> Richardson takes leave of Obama over financial probe </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 By Arshad Mahmud in Washingtom Washington, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com)Just two weeks before his inauguration, President-elect Barack Obama got an unexpected jolt on Sunday when his commerce secretary-designate abruptly withdrew his name from consideration because of an ongoing investigation into improper financial dealings involving him and a financial company. Gov Bill Richardson of New Mexico reportedly awarded a state contract to a California firm that contributed to his political campaign. Richardson, 61, who competed unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination, was secretary of energy and U.N. ambassador during Bill Clinton's presidency, and also the first high-profile Latino named to Obama's incoming Cabinet. "It is with deep regret that I accept Governor Bill Richardson's decision to withdraw his name for nomination as the next Secretary of Commerce," Obama said in a statement in Chicago, only a few hours before he flew to Washington with his family in preparation for the official oath-taking on January 20. "Governor Richardson is an outstanding public servant and would have brought to the job of Commerce Secretary and our economic team great insights accumulated through an extraordinary career in federal and state office", he added. "It is a measure of his willingness to put the nation first that he has removed himself as a candidate for the Cabinet in order to avoid any delay in filling this important economic post at this critical time." Earlier, Richardson issued a statement that said: "Let me say unequivocally that I and my Administration have acted properly in all matters and that this investigation will bear out that fact. But I have concluded that the ongoing investigation also would have forced an untenable delay in the confirmation process. Given the gravity of the economic situation the nation is facing, I could not in good conscience ask the President-elect and his Administration to delay for one day the important work that needs to be done." The decision is the first serious political hit for one of Obama's Cabinet nominees and comes just as Senate confirmation hearings begin next week. Richardson, however, said he would remain governor of New Mexico "for now." The probe involves questions about a California firm, CDR Financial Products, and its president, David Rubin. The grand jury in New Mexico is looking into whether the firm was given a contract with the State Finance Authority because of pressure from Richardson. According to news reports, the firm and Rubin together gave $100,000 to two Richardson organizations shortly before winning the contract.
