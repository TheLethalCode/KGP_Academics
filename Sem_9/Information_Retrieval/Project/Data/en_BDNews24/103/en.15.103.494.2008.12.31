 LONDON, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England and Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard was charged with assault on Tuesday after a fight at a bar in northwest England, police said. Gerrard, 28, was one of six men arrested in the early hours of Dec. 29 after police were called to a bar in Southport. A 34-year-old man was taken to hospital with facial injuries. "Steven Gerrard has been charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and affray," the duty inspector for Merseyside Police said. The incident followed Liverpool's 5-1 win at Newcastle United on Sunday in which Gerrard scored twice. In a brief statement, the club said: "Steven has been an outstanding servant to Liverpool for the last 10 years and the club will give him all the support he needs at this time." Two men have been charged alongside Gerrard with the same offences. All three are due to appear before North Sefton magistrates on Jan. 23, accused of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and affray, according to a police statement. Three other men have been released on police bail pending further inquiries
