 Dhaka, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com)  Police picked up two Bangladesh Chhatra League activists on Friday from Muktijoddha Ziaur Rahman Hall of Dhaka University on charges of rioting. Pro-Awami League students Golam Baqui Chowdhury and Ziaul Haque were involved in Thursday's riots in the hall, police alleged. Three had been reportedly injured on Thursday while the two belligerent BCL factions fought. Police retrieved 10 improvised bombs after a search of the hall after the fights. "Hall residents detained Baqui and Ziaul around noon. Acting on a tip-off, police arrested them and brought them over to the police station. They were actively involved in [Thursday's] brawls," Shahbagh police chief Rezaul Karim told bdnews24.com. DU leaders of BCL went up to the residential hall after the fights, identified six students including Baqui and Ziaul as troublemakers and gave the names to the hall administration. DU chapter president of BCL Sheikh Sohel Rana Tipu told bdnews24.com: "Any attempt at destabilising the campus will be thwarted, irrespective of partisan identities." "Any Chhatra League activist found guilty of breach of discipline will be taken to task by the party, in addition to the punitive measures the hall authorities would deem necessary to take." In 2001, following BNP's phenomenal emergence as the national polls winners, leaders and activists of Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, its student front, had chased BCL adherents out of the DU halls. With AL winning the recent national polls, some scattered untoward incidents occurred on the DU campus, which the CL leaders and activists said they were trying to curb effectively. bd
