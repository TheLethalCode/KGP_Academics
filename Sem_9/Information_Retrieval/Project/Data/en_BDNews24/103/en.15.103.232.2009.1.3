Despite an international moratorium on whaling since 1986, Japan justifies the hunt on the grounds this whaling is for "scientific" purposes.

"We have engaged them, we have stopped their whaling activities for two weeks and we have successfully chased them out of the Australian Antarctic territorial waters," Watson said in the statement Friday. "We now have to return to land to refuel. We don't have the luxury of refueling at sea like the Japanese fleet has." Sea Shepherd said that it had pursued the Japanese fleet for two weeks and driven it out of waters Australia claims around its Antarctic territory. The Japanese say they are in international waters.
