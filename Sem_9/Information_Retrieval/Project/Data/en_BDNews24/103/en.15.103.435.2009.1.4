 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com)  Speaker Muhammad Jamiruddin Sircar has said he can no longer administer oaths to office of the newly-elected MPs of BNP and its allies because of the constitutional provision in timing. "I cannot administer oath to the BNP and Jamaat MPs because of the constitutional limitations," Sircar told bdnews24.com on Sunday at his office after administering oath to some lawmakers. The 32 polls winners of the four-party alliance did not turn up to parliament to take oath on Sunday, though they were scheduled to do so. The elected lawmakers from BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami and Bangladesh Jatiya Party will have to be sworn in by the chief election commissioner within the next three working days, Sircar said. If they fail to have their oath administered by the CEC within those three days, then they must be sworn in by the new speaker within 90 days, he said. The outgoing speaker referred to article 148 of the constitution that stipulated that the newly elected MPs must take oath from the incumbent speaker within three days of the publication of election results by gazette. The official gazette of the ninth parliamentary polls was published on Thursday night. "If they do not take oath from the speaker within three days from publication of the gazette, they will have to take oath through the chief election commissioner," said Sircar. "If they come to me after three days, I cannot administer oaths owing to constitutional limitations," said Sircar. "After the expiry of the timelimit set for the chief election commissioner, they must take oath within 90 days of start of parliament according to constitutional provision," he said. Five lawmakers Oil Ahmad (Liberal Democratic Party), Ranajit Kumar Roy (Awami League), Md Kobirul Hoque (Independent, Narail-1), Khondoker Abdul Baten (Independent, Tangail-6) and Mohammad Fazlul Azim (Independent, Noakhali-6) on Sunday took oath. With Sunday's swearing in, 263 lawmakers took oath from the outgoing Sircar, who was a BNP lawmaker from Panchagarh-1 constituency. bd
