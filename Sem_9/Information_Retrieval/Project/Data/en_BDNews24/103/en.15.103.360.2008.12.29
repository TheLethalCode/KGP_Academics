 Dhaka, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com) - The chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda in a televised speech on Sunday evening assured the nation of all necessary preparations for a free and fair election on Monday and invited all to apply their voting rights without fear. "I'm inviting all voters, regardless of political differences, to go to polling centres taking the opportunity of the secure environment to cast their invaluable votes," the CEC said. He mentioned three key measures, security measures, photo voter roll and translucent ballot boxes, that would ensure a free, fair and credible vote. The top election official gave a brief review of the Election Commission's roadmap over the past two years towards the much-awaited 9th Jatiya Sangsad election. Describing the security measures being taken by law enforcing agencies, the CEC said, "From the experience of city corporation and municipality elections last August, we're confirmed that the environment on the general election day will also be peaceful." "I'm requesting you to go to voting centres and cast votes for two more special reasons, one is photo-included voter roll and the other is translucent ballot boxes." With these measures, it is almost impossible to adopt unfair means in the elections, the CEC said. To the voters, the election chief gave some tips on how voters can cast their ballot "effectively", from knowing their respective polling centres ahead of time to having voter serial numbers ready. He also assured that EC officials and government officials will discharge their election duties properly on the day and the process of announcing polls results from constituencies was secure. Mobile phone networks will run as usual on the day, though voters will not be allowed to take mobile phone devices into the polling centres. He told the nation that the counting of votes will be neutral. Huda dubbed Dec. 29 a historic day for the country: "After a rough journey, we are now standing at a critical juncture of the nation. Only a firm confidence in democracy, can lead us to overcome all crises." bdn
