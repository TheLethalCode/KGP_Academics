 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury, Sumon Mahmud, Abdur Rahim Harmachi, Sumon Mahbub bdnews24.com correspondents Dhaka, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com)  Election officials received complaints from rival parties in early hours of vote on Monday with allegations ranging from violations of code by candidates to presence of partisan monitors and polling officers. Muhammad Ali, a former secretary and Awami League advisory council member, filed the formal complaints on behalf of the party while Habibul Islam Habib, a former pro-AL student leader, led the BNP team to the EC headquarters at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar. Reports of peaceful polling have, however, overshadowed sporadic incidents of clashes between rival camps in various parts of the country and the complaints by the candidates. Election chief ATM Shamsul Huda said the first four to six hours of polling saw some 50 percent of votes cast in centres he had visited until afternoon, while his colleagues at his headquarters registered the complaints. "The presiding officers of the centres I visited said about 50 percent votes have been cast by 12:50pm and 70 percent in some cases," he told reporters just before 2pm. The AL list of complaints alleged, among others, campaigning by BNP chief Khaleda Zia on the night before vote and use of money to buy vote. The BNP list included capturing of polling centres by AL supporters in one constituency, according to Habib. Rashed Khan Menon, a grand alliance nominee for a Dhaka seat, brought allegations of bias against one observer group. Long queues and hopes A wintry morning turned sunny as voters across Bangladesh queued up in festive mood from 8am, hoping for a peaceful return to democracy after almost two years of military-installed government. Voicing hopes that the outcome would be accepted by all, chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed cast his vote looking "to a power handover soon". Huda had earlier said he was hoping for a turnout as high as 75 percent as he came out casting his ballot at a school in the capital. Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina, flanked by sister Sheikh Rehana, was one of the early voters to arrive at Dhanmondi's City College centre at 8:30am. She said she was confident of winning but voiced concern over polls-eve irregularities. Khaleda, as she cast her ballot at Dhaka Cantonment just after noon, said she would accept the results of a fair vote. Pride Army chief General Moeen U Ahmed took some pride in being able to complete the 81 million-strong biometric national ID card roll "in just 11 months" after voting and posing for photos at the same Cantonment centre at 11:40pm. Early reports from 299 constituencies across Bangladesh say the polling has generally been peaceful, but there has been some turmoil in some cases resulting from the newly-introduced photo-based identity cards. bdnews24.com correspondent Moinul Hoque Chowdhury says Huda has been trying to encourage "the young, new and the first-time voters". Complaints In Dhaka, some young voters carrying ID cards complained that their names were not found on the voters' list. Our correspondent says the CEC has ordered an immediate investigation into the matter. In one glaring example, ID card carrying pensioner Serajul Islam, 71, failed to find his name on the roll at a Dhanmondi centre in the capital. Son Serajus Saleheen, a multinational executive, said all members of the family filled up the forms together. "He's waited since 6am to vote," said Saleheen, who, however, was enrolled and could vote. Saleheen said the presiding officer told him at 1:30pm the centre had received "at least 50 such complaints so far". A voter turnout of 75 percent or more would reflect a trend for high turnout seen in Bangladesh's two immediate past elections. In 2001, 75.59 percent voted, with 74.37 percent found valid. In 1996, the turnout was 75.60 percent, with validity at 74.81 percent. The lowest ever turnout was recorded in the highly controversial Feb. 15, 1996 polls, at just 26.74 percent. As usual, Election Day has been a government holiday, with voters queuing up at polling centres from early morning, and later spilling out onto the streets that were pleasantly free of traffic. "Polling will continue up to 4pm, uninterrupted," Huda had told bdnews24.com. The CEC in a televised speech on Sunday evening assured the nation of all necessary preparations for a free and fair election, inviting all to apply their voting rights without fear. "I'm inviting all voters, regardless of political differences, to go to polling centres taking the opportunity of the secure environment to cast their invaluable votes," the CEC said. This was Bangladesh's ninth parliamentary election since independence, and the first national vote in seven years. Khaleda, two-time former prime minister, stepped down at the end of her five-year term on Oct. 28, 2006. Iajuddin Ahmed was sworn in next day as head of a caretaker government. But the Jan. 22, 2007 general election was postponed amid allegations by the Awami League and its allies that BNP had stacked the Election Commission with partisans and stuffed the voter rolls with 1.4 crore fake names. A state of emergency was imposed on Jan. 11, with certain fundamental rights suspended and a nighttime curfew imoposed. Iajuddin then resigned as the head of the caretaker government entrusted to run the polls. A military-installed interim government headed by Fakhruddin Ahmed lifted the state of emergency on Dec. 17. Noakhali-1 constituency will hold its poll on Jan. 12, deferred after the death of Awami League-led grand alliance candidate Nurul Islam.
