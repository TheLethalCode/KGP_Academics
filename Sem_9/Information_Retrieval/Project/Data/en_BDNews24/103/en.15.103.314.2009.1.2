 Gazipur, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com)  Preparation is going on for 44th Biswa Ijtema, the second largest congregation of Muslims in the world after the hajj, on the bank of the river Turag on Jan.30-Feb.1. The gathering will come to a close with Akheri Minnajat or final prayers on Feb. 1, the organisers say. Volunteers of Tablighi Jamaat, a Muslim missionary that organises the annual event, are preparing the Ijtema ground at Tongi. The devotees are constructing makeshift tents with CI sheets for overseas pilgrims at the northwestern side of the ground. "Shura members set dates for the Ijtema every year immediately after previous Ijtema ends," Muhammad Giasuddin, 55, one of the revered Ijtema brains, told bdnews24.com. The 43rd edition of Bishwa Ijtema lasted only for one day in 2008 due to inclement weather first since it was launched in 1946. . He further said it ended last year at the end of the beginning day due to inclement weather through Akheri Munajat that is usually held at the last day of the three-day long Ijtema. bdnews24.c
