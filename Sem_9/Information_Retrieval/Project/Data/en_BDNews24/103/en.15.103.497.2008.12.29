 Dhaka, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com)  Election Working Group, a 32-member alliance of local election observers, said their immediate reaction to Monday's election was that it was satisfactory on the whole. EWG released the results of a 'quick impression survey' at a press conference on Monday night, based on findings until 12pm on the election day. The election observers' network in a statement said their findings were preliminary and that they would release a comprehensive report from its observer mission on Jan. 3. The survey based on observations from in and around 651 polling centres acknowledges some instances of voter insecurity and irregularities, voting process and illegal campaigning. Rezaul Karim Chowdhury of ADD, an NGO, in his key note presentation said inadequate security and slow voting process discouraged voters from staying at the polling centers in the three districts of Chittagong Hill Tracts. There were cases of fake voting in Chapainawabgonj, Feni and Bogra. "Inadequate protection for secrecy of voting were reported from Sylhet and incidents of attempted election day campaigning came in from Habiganj and Bogra," he told the briefing. Tendered votes were cast in Chapainawabganj and Dhaka-19 constituency, added the NGO official. ADD executive director Mohsin Ali alleged observers were prevented from monitoring elections on certain occasions. "There have been cases reported where observers were barred from entering polling stations, being expelled by presiding officer and also by the chief judicial magistrate in Rajshahi-6 constituency." In three cases, EWG observers were accused of being biased or acting in a partisan manner, he added. Mohsin said EWG was investigating these cases in line with their "strict code of ethics". bd
