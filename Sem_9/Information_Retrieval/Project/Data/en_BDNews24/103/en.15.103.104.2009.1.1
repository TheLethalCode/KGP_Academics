<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com)  Former BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, who ran and lost as an independent candidate in the election, has a five-point charter of recommendations for the new government for "an effective parliament". "These recommendations if adopted will make the parliament centre of all activities and consolidate democracy," said Mannan Bhuiyan. While conceding defeat in his home constituency of Narsingdi-3, Bhuiyan told reporters Thursday that as a responsible politician he wanted to present his five proposals to the incoming government. The recommendations, for allowing opposition members more of a voice in parliament, touch on accelerated formation of parliamentary committees, choosing chiefs of committees from the opposition and adopting a policy not to harass opposition members. Grand alliance candidate Zahirul Islam Mohan won the Narsingdi-3 seat in Monday's election that fetched Awami League and its allies a landslide victory. "I have already congratulated the winner in my constituency," said Bhuiyan. "I also congratulate AL president Sheikh Hasina and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia for their victory in the polls," said the sacked BNP secretary general, who was formerly known as a party 'reformist'. Bhuiyan was ousted from the party by BNP chief Khaleda Zia when she emerged from jail in Sept 2008. bdnew
