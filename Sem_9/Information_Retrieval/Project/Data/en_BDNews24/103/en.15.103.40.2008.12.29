<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Party chief HM Ershad won all three seats he was contesting, and his party bagged 27 as part of the grand alliance's overwhelming victory in Monday's national vote. JP chairman HM Ershad had earlier in the day estimated that his party would get at least 30 seats and, if the election was held properly, the grand alliance would go to power. "I am happy to have been able to vote as a free person," said Ershad as he cast the first vote in Rangpur-3 at the Senapara Government Primary High School in the morning. Optimistic about his chances, he had said, "I shall win in all three seats." The JP chief did not vote in the previous parliamentary elections, and could not contest in the 2001 elections due to legal complications. In 1991 and 1996 he ran in polls as a prisoner, and in both cases he won five seats. JP, running as an ally of Awami League, had bargained hard to secure a 46-seat deal ahead of the election. Notable among the losers was JP faction leader and former first lady Rawshan Ershad who lost her two constituencies of Gaibandha-5 and Mymensingh-4. Among the winning JP candidates AKM Mostafizur Rahman won in Kurigram-1. His nearest rival was Saidur Rahman Rana, a four-party alliance candidate. Jafar Ahmed Siddiqui bagged Nilphamari-1, beating four-party alliance candidate Rafiqul Islam. In Nilphamari-3 Kazi Faruk Kader beat four-party alliance candidate Md Azizul Islam. MA Jabbar won Satkhira-2, beating runner up Md Abdul Khaleque of the four-party alliance. Momtaj Iqbal won in Sunamganj-4. bdnew
