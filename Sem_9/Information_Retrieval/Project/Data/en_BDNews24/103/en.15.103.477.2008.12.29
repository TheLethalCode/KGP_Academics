 Rangpur, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com)  JP chairman HM Ershad estimates that his party will get at least 30 seats and, if the election is held properly, the grand alliance will go to power. "I am happy to have been able to vote as a free person," said Ershad as he cast the first vote in Rangpur-3 constituency at the Senapara Government Primary High School. The former president is competing in the 9th parliamentary election from a total of three seats including. Optimistic about his chances, he said, "Including the Rangpur-3 seat, I shall win in all three seats." Mentioning media reports of incidents of vote tampering the previous night, Ershad observed: "On TV we saw that Jamaat and the four party alliance are trying to buy votes; but there is no such allegation against the grand alliance." The JP chief did not vote in the previous parliamentary elections, and could not contest in the 2001 elections due to legal complications. In 1991 and 1996 he ran in polls as a prisoner, and in both cases he won five seats. After visiting Rangpur Zilla School and Lalkuthi Girls' School, Ershad departed Rangpur for Dhaka at 9am. bdnews24.com/correspond
