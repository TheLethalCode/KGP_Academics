 DHAKA, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)- Sri Lankan spinner Ajantha Mendis joined the squad in Bangladesh on Monday after a quick recovery from an ankle injury that was expected to keep him out of the test series. Mendis, 23, suffered severe soft tissue damage in his right ankle during a domestic game early this month and was replaced by left-arm spinner Rangana Herath for the two-test series. "My ankle is alright now as I am feeling no pain," Mendis told reporters on his arrival in Dhaka on Monday. He is now expected to play in the second test starting in Chittagong on Saturday. Sri Lanka are in command in the first test in Dhaka after taking an overall lead of 406 runs after the third day. Monday is rest day due to parliamentary elections. The unorthodox finger spinner was declared Man-of-the-Series on his test debut against India in July-August, taking 26 wickets at 18.38 runs apiece to help clinch the three-game series 2-1. If he plays in Chittagong, it will only be his fourth test
