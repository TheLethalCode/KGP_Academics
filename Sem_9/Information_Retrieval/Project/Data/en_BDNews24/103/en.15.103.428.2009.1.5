 Khulna, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com)  Two people were killed, including an Awami League worker, and two others injured in a bomb attack at Pabla Shahapara in Khulna on Sunday. The deceased were identified as 30 year-old Parvez Howlader and 60 year-old Suborna Shaha. The critically injured Rekha Shaaha (35) and Dilip Kumar Saha (55) were admitted to Khulna Medical College Hospital. Unknown 'terrorists' hurled bombs at local AL worker Parvez at around 9.30pm, who initially escaped with injuries, said officer in charge Shahidul Islam of Daulatpur police station quoting witnesses. "The attackers threw a second hand bomb killing Parvez on the spot, and then stabbed him heinously with sharp weapons," said Islam again quoting witnesses. "Three others of a nearby house were also near the spot, and wounded in the bomb attack," said OC Islam. Suborna Shaha died after being admitted to Khulna Medical College Hospital. The police officer could not confirm why Parvez was attacked. Mozammel Huq Howlader, uncle of Parvez, was also at a loss to explain the cause of the attack. Parvez was on his way to his maternal uncle's residence at Pabla Shahapara from his house at Dakkhin Dewara in Daulatpur when he was attacked. bdnews24.c
