 Dhaka, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com) - BNP chief Khaleda Zia won in all three seats, Feni-1, Bogra-6 and 7, though her alliance had won less than 30 seats up to 2.30am as rival party Awami League headed for a landslide win. The four-party alliance headed by BNP brought serious allegations of irregularities in Monday's general election, as early results showed the rival Awami League-led grand alliance leading in many of the 299 seats. A delegation of mid-level leaders from BNP and its ally Jamaat-e-Islami met with the chief election commissioner at around 9:30pm. "We have been saying that the administration is working in favour of the grand alliance. Our apprehension has proved right," Mirza Abbas told reporters after emerging from the meeting at the Election Commission Secretariat. "The commission could not take proper measures to [address the issues]," he said. Asked what allegations they had made to the EC, Abbas said: "The commission knows it well." BNP's Sahabuddin Laltu, Jamaat's leader Abdul Kader Mollah and Jashim Uddin Sarker were also on the delegation. BNP will hold a press briefing on election results on Tuesday, party office secretary Rizvi Ahmed told reporters on Monday night. "We have got information of allegation of irregularities in 220 centres out of 72 constituencies across the country. We have informed them to the Election Commission," he said. "The grand alliance supporters barred our people from casting votes in those centres." He also alleged BNP candidates' vehicles were held at many places though they had valid papers. The BNP chairperson said that she had expected that the voting would be held in a proper environment but it was getting late due to mismanagement. If the election was held fairly the four-party alliance would win the election by huge votes, she said. bdnews
