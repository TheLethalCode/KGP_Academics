 BAGHDAD, Sun Dec 29,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Iraqi court on Sunday opened a new trial against Tareq Aziz and the man known as 'Chemical Ali,' right-hand men to Saddam Hussein, on charges of crushing opposition from Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's Dawa party. Aziz, a former deputy prime minister, and Ali Hassan al-Majeed, dubbed 'Chemical Ali' for his role in gassing Saddam's enemies, were in a Baghdad court charged with quashing political parties under Saddam's Baath party government. Majeed has already been sentenced twice to death and is being tried on separate charges over a 1988 gas attack that killed 5,000 of Iraq's minority Kurds. Disputes within Maliki's government have so far stalled Majeed's execution. Prosecutor Mehdi al-Hedow said the new charges involved the arrest of tens of thousands of members of Iraqi political parties, sent to jail and often executed between 1981 and Saddam's ouster in the US-led invasion of 2003. The charges of "crimes against humanity" against Aziz, Majeed and more than 20 other defendants centered on alleged crimes against members of Maliki's Shi'ite Dawa party, founded in the 1950s in a bid to promote the role of Islam in Iraqi politics. One instance of reported political suppression dates to July 1981, when 1,135 people were arrested from the town of Balad north of Baghdad. Of them, 379 were killed, Hedow said. "We want to give a true depiction of crimes committed by the Saddamists against sons of Iraq in Balad. We must show people across the nation, especially those characterizing Saddam as an Arab nationalist and his government as a democracy," he said. Hedow said Saddam-era documents showed that the number of those arrested exceeded 200,000 in what was described as a systematic drive to purge Saddam's political opposition. Many were executed on the grounds of belonging to the Dawa party, Hedow said. Aziz, also a former foreign minister and one of the few Christians in Saddam's inner circle, is also being tried for executing merchants who broke price controls. He denies the charges. Both men, now elderly, appeared in poor health. Aziz walks with a cane. Majeed, who was hospitalized earlier this year, was excused by Judge Mohammed al-Uraibi from afternoon proceedings due to his health. Maliki, who became prime minister in 2006, joined the Dawa party as a young man in 1970. He fled Iraq in 1979 and lived as an opposition leader in Jordan, Syria and Iran until 2003. He was sentenced to death in absentia by Saddam's government
