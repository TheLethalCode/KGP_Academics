 MADRID, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news from the Primera Liga ahead of this weekend's matches: Apart from the tonsilitis-stricken Gonzalo Higuain, Real Madrid coach Juande Ramos has a full squad available for Sunday's home match against Villarreal (1600 GMT), the Primera Liga champions said on their website (www.realmadrid.com). Defenders Pepe, Gabriel Heinze and Christoph Metzelder and midfield pair Rafael van der Vaart and Wesley Sneijder have recovered from various ailments and are fit, while new signings Klaas Jan Huntelaar and Lassana Diarra could also feature. Villarreal will be looking for their 500th Primera Liga goal at the Santiago Bernabeu, where they have never won since they joined Spain's top division in the 1998-99 season. "Playing at Real Madrid is very tricky but I think we can get a positive result and win," striker Giuseppe Rossi said. The Real stadium was also where Gica Craioveanu scored their first goal in the top flight in August 1998. Atletico Madrid striker Diego Forlan said the club's rivals are living in fear of their formidable attacking line, including himself and strike partner Sergio Aguero and wingers Simao Sabrosa and Maxi Rodriguez. "It's true that we are capable of scoring a lot of goals," the Uruguayan said in an interview with Marca newspaper ahead of their trip to Valencia on Saturday (2100 GMT). Atletico's Portuguese midfielder Maniche was unable to train on Thursday because of a right knee problem, the club said on their website (www.clubatleticodemadrid.com). Valencia could sell striker David Villa and winger David Silva to help ease their financial difficulties if they receive "an exorbitant offer", club official Fernando Gomez Colomer was quoted as saying on Friday. "Whatever offer comes in we will have to study it although the idea is not to have to sell David Villa or David Silva," he was quoted as saying by Britain's Independent newspaper. "It would have to be an exorbitant offer." Barcelona's Brazilian defender Silvinho said he has no plans to leave in the winter transfer period and is happy to see out his contract, which runs to the end of this season. "I am happy with the number of matches I have played," the former Arsenal man said on the club's website (www.fcbarcelona.com). Silvinho has seen action eight times this season, including four Champions League games. Real Mallorca midfielder Juan Arango said no team is invincible ahead of the Primera Liga strugglers' match against leaders Barca at the Nou Camp on Saturday (1900). "In any match it's possible to win, draw or lose and no team is invincible," he told the club's website (www.rcdmallorca.es). "We are going there to get a good result." Mallorca are one place above the relegation zone with 14 points from 16 matches
