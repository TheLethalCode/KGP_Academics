 Dhaka, Jan 03 (bdnews24.com) Sheikh Hasina has asked the BNP-Jaamat alliance to show "restraint" and not to attack the leaders and activists of Awami League. "Everybody will have to exercise restraint. None should do anything that will earn a bad name for them," Hasina told a press conference after taking oath as MP and then being elected leader of the AL parliamentary party (ALPP). "I would urge the opposition parties to play a constructive role in parliament," said Hasina, also Leader of the House for the ninth parliament, set to go into its first session later this month. One of her priority tasks, she said, would be to maintain law and order in the country. "If I believed in retaliation, the consequences would be very serious. "Our party leaders and activists are being killed by the BNP-Jaamat supporters, but we haven't responded," Hasina told reporters at the prime minister's conference room at Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban. In a number of cases of post-election violence, she alleged, the Awami League leaders and activists were "killed or tortured". "I urge the four-party alliance to stop (attacking my partymen). They should come to parliament and play the role of the opposition no matter how small they are," Hasina said. After the 2001 elections, she said, the BNP-led four party alliance "pursued the politics of vengeance and killed many leaders and activists of her party". Replying to a question, she said, "Containing price hike of essentials and the maintaining law and order will be priority tasks." Earlier, Hasina took oath as MP for Gopalganj-3 constituency and signed the necessary the papers at the parliament secretary's office in the afternoon. Then she chaired the first meeting of the Awami League parliamentary party at the conference room at the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban. Presidium member Syeda Sajeda Chowdhurys proposed to elect Sheikh Hasina as Leader of the parliamentary party. The Awami League president then went to meet Speaker Muhammad Jamiruddin Sircar to discuss the 100-odd ordinances promulgated by the Fakhruddin Ahmed-led interim government. "I have discussed with him (Speaker) about the validation of the ordinances," Sheikh Hasina said. "(Since) he (Speaker) is a good lawyer." Meanwhile, Jatiya Party, one of the components of the Awami League-led grand alliance, held its first meeting of its parliamentary party. "Party chairman H M Ershad has been elected as the head of the parliamentary party," G M Quader, his brother and newly elected MP for Lalmonirhat-3, told bdnews24.com Saturda
