<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com) - BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia on Tuesday night alleged the announcement of results after Monday's national vote was staged to defeat the four-party alliance. She further alleged that 'vote rigging' was unprecedented. "After Monday's polls, the Election Commission only announced a staged result set earlier," Khaleda said at a midnight press briefing. Asked whether she was rejecting the results, she said, "You can understand what is meant by 'unacceptable'". "We will talk about the issue later." After the four-party's catastrophic losses in Monday's parliamentary polls, an 'emotional' Khaleda chaired an emergency meeting of the party's highest policymaking body, the National Standing Committee, on Tuesday evening. "The results of the staged election is not acceptable to BNP," Khaleda told reporters after the meeting. Her voice laden with sarcasm, the two-time former prime minister 'thanked' the chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda "for presenting the nation a well-staged election". "By 12 noon, 45 to 50 percent ballots were cast. Later voters' attendence was low. But counting shows 90 percent voters cast ballots. How did it happen?" Prior to the meeting of the 11-strong committee, Khaleda appeared emotional as she waved at a few hundred supporters from the second floor of the office around 6:45pm, witnesses said. She stood there in silence for sometime as party supporters shouted slogans. The meeting was the first organisational move after the party's defeat in Monday's general elections. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, committee members Khandker Mosharraf Hossain, RA Gani, Chowdhury Tanvir Ahmed Siddiqui, Khandker Mahbub Uddin Ahmad and M Shamsul Islam attended the meeting at the chairperson's Gulshan office. bdnew
