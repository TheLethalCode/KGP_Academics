 UNITED NATIONS, Mon Dec 29,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Sunday called for an immediate end to all violence in Gaza, which has been under Israeli assault for two days in retaliation for mortar and rocket attacks from the Hamas-ruled Palestinian territory. The statement issued through Ban's spokesperson said he had called for calm in talks with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and other regional leaders.
