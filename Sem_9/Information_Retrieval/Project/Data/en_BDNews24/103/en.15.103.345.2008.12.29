 Dhaka, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com)Awami League president Sheikh Hasina expressed hopes, as she voted Monday morning, that the AL-led alliance would be serving the people soon but also voiced concerns over reported polling irregularities. "At last, after a long wait, I am very happy to be casting my vote. The right to vote is a citizen's most desired right," Hasina said at City College polling centre in Dhanmondi. "I hope all Bangladeshis will vote to establish a people's government." Hasina along with younger sister Sheikh Rehana arrived at the polling centre at 8:30 am. "The grand alliance will, I hope, soon be able to serve the country," Hasina told reporters after casting her ballot. "I want democracy to be rejuvenated in Bangladesh and endow people with a benign life. We aim to effect uplift of the people only." "The government must be accountable to the people, who want and deserve to live a peaceful and prosperous life. I'm optimistic about re-establishing democratic practices in the country," the former prime minister said. "It was AL who had transferred power peacefully in 2001," she said. "Every other transfer was accompanied by some not-too-pleasant occurrence or other. People in power usually tended to stick to the hot seats." Along with high hopes of victory, however, Hasina said conspiracies and underhand dealings were afoot by corrupt officials, candidates and their cohorts. Citing media reports on the eve of Election Day, she said: "Police held two Jama'at workers in Cox's Bazaar while they were busy buying votes, arrested a presiding officer at Tangail while he was stamping ballot papers ahead of the polls, detained Shamsul Alam's brother-in-law with Tk 41 lakh and nabbed Barkatullah Bulu's cohorts with Tk 70,000." Hasina also listed other incidents involving "embezzlement and play of ill motives around the polls". "Ballot papers meant for my seat Rangpur-6 have mysteriously landed in the hands of the four-party alliance," she said. "How are bundles of ballot paper being redirected? What is the government doing? What steps is Election Commission taking to address these?" "We'd expect the polls to be free and fair. Reporters must be watchful and carefully monitor the whole election process." "Today is a crucial day in the nation's life." Hasina is scheduled to go out at 11 am to visit other city polling centres. bd
