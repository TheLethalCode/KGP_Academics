 Dhaka, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com)  Chief Election Commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda on Thursday did not want to directly comment on BNP's allegations of election rigging, but said the polls were watched by the world and it was not wise to reject the people's verdict. "The people of this country are conscious and politically aware," he said, commending the record-breaking 87 percent voter turnout. "The nation has seen if the election was held under proper circumstances or not and future generations will also judge it," said the polls chief at his first formal post-election briefing. Saying the election would be evaluated against future ones, Huda added: "Actions speak louder than words." Huda thanked the media, hoping that such successful elections would also be held in the future. "People will evaluate this election in terms of success and failure when another commission holds another election in future." "I have some recommendations about how election commissioners should be chosen and under what criteria; this will be handed over to the new government," said the CEC in answer to a question about preventing the EC's politicisation under an elected government. On allegations of vote rigging by defeated BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, he said only: "It would not be prudent to disregard the verdict of the people." "I believe that the election has been free, fair and peaceful." "An effort was made to set an international standard, though a few accidents can occur in such a large scale election." "But if a proper atmosphere is created then the people of the nation will vote," said Huda. "For this reason, we witnessed a huge and spontaneous turnout of voters for the 9th parliamentary elections." The election chief said that the response from voters who travelled to their villages to vote overwhelmed him. He congratulated first-time and women voters, who made up 31 percent and 51 percent respectively of the over eight crore enrolled, for helping the country get back on track to democracy. Asked why 'No' votes were cast for many 'competent' candidates, the CEC said, "These matters can be elaborated on by political pundits, the EC is just 'a referee'." "Political parties must choose competent candidates, but in a crucial time voters do not bother about competent camdidates, they become concerned about overcoming the crisis "At that time they just vote for a symbol." "This has happened at critical moments and we can remember back to 1954. This time voters were determined to emerge from an abnormal situation that lasted two years," observed the CEC. Talking about complaints of voter number and name discrepancies during the polls, he said, "The commission has already begun work in this regard and the problems will be rectified in the next election, if not for the upcoming Upazila election." "We must use this election as a basis and make future polls even better." He said updating of the voter list has been delayed to February from the previously-scheduled date of Jan 2. Preparations for publishing the election results would be finished Thursday, the CEC informed. Election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain and commission secretary Md Humayun Kabir were present at the press briefing,. bdnews
