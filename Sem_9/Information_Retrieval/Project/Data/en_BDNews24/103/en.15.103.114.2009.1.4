 Dhaka, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh Chhatra League, the student wing of Awami League, observed its 61st founding anniversary on Sunday with a senior AL figure urging BCL activists to avoid "hostile politics". AL joint general secretary Obaidul Qader formally inaugurated the day's programmes on the campus by releasing balloons at noon. Speaking at a later meeting, he urged BCL leaders and supporters to avoid hostile politics and ensure peaceful co-existence with the other student bodies on the campus. His call came following reports of BCL factional feuds and clashes in different dormitories on the campus since the AL's landslide victory in the Dec. 29 election. BCL central president Mahmud Hasan Ripon, general secretary Mahfuzul Haider Chowdhury Roton, DU unit BCL president Sohel Rana Tipu and general secretary Sazzad Saqib Badsha, among others, attended the discussion. Qader told the BCL leaders and supporters to refrain from occupying dormitories forcing out students from other student bodies. The day's programme began earlier with a cake cutting ceremony at Curzon Hall, to the mark the anniversary of the student body formed under the leadership of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as a young law student and campus activist. Known then as the East Pakistan Student League, it was formally founded on Jan. 4 in 1948. Since its inception BCL contributed to 1952's Language Movement, 1959's Mass Upsurge, 1971's Liberation War, 1990's Anti-Autocrat Movement among other landmark events. The BCL took out a parade on DU campus Sunday morning, which was joined by supporters from other educational institutions. bdnews
