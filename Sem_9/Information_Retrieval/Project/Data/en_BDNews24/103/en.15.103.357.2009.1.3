<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 03 (bdnews24.com)  Sheikh Hasina Saturday issued a stern warning against corruption and wrong-doing as she spoke at the first meeting of AL parliamentary party (ALPP) which formally endorsed her as leader. "Anyone charged with irregularities will face action," the prime minister-elect told fellow MPs. The meeting chose senior presidium member Zillur Rahman as deputy leader of the ALPP, a position that will also make him deputy leader of the House. "We must learn from our past mistakes," Hasina said in remarks obtained from a number of party MPs, who did not wish to be named. "Whatever we want to achieve can be done through honest means," she was quoted to have told the meeting of 227 party MPs. "People have reposed so much trust and confidence in us. We must keep that in mind... this is a huge responsibility. "You must not be unfair to anyone. You must always be in touch with your constituents. You must try to fulfil their aspirations." She asked them to exercise restraint. "You must be patient and tolerant." Hasina, prime minister and leader of the House during 1996-2001, advised the first-time MPs to "carefully read the rules of business of parliament and the Constitution."
