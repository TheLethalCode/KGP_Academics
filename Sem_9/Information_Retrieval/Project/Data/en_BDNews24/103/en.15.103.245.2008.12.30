 Dhaka, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh went on for lunch with 40 for one after Sri Lanka set the hosts to chase a massive 521 runs to win the first of two Tests series on the fourth day at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Tuesday. Tamim Iqbal was batting on 24 with Junaed Siddique on nought. Opener Imrul Kayes was run out by Tilakaratne Dilshan for a 16-ball 13, leaving the side at 40 for one. Sri Lanka had earlier declared their second innings at 405 for six, taking a lead of 520. After a one-day break due to the national elections on Monday, the visitors resumed the day on 291 for four and added a quick 114 for the losses of two overnight batsmen. Mahela Jayawardene and Tilakratne Dilshan put on a blitz 95 runs for the fifth wicket with an average of 5.81 per over before both batsmen returned to the dressing room in the space of two runs. Dilshan edged Shakib Al Hasan to wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim but not before a quick 52-ball 45 studded with one six and three fours while Jayawardene took his overnight score of 129 to 168 before being a victim of Mehrab Hossain Junior, who returned two for 37. Jayawardene struck 19 fours and one six in his 269-ball knock. Prasanna Jayawardene (3) and Chaminda Vaas (15) remained unbeaten when Sri Lanka declared their innings soon after drinks in the first session on the fourth day. bd
