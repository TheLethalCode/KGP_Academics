<TITLE> BNP will help as opposition if govt wants: Delwar </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com)  BNP on Friday said it would cooperate as the opposition in parliament if the government truly party wanted it. "If the government really wants to make the parliament functioning and seeks our cooperation, then it would get that from us," BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain told reporters at his NAM flat residence in the afternoon. Delwar, however, observed the functioning of a parliament depended on the eagerness of the government and the government party. The prime minister-in-waiting Sheikh Hasina has repeatedly stressed on a stronger opposition for an effective parliament. Delwar, who lost on in the Dec. 29 general election as did BNP-led four-party alliance, said, "The Effectiveness of the parliament depends on the behaviour of parliament leader, speaker and government party. "The government party must be patient and the opposition party will have to be given chances to speak." If there was a proper government party attitude towards the opposition, then even a smaller opposition would not face any trouble, he observed. But for that to happen, he added, the political parties needed to get over the past political culture. "Our political behaviour should be better in the future. We should come out of such attitude that 'Don't even meet one with different opinion'," Delwar said. He once again repeated the allegation that the general election was rigged and the outcome tailored. "There must have been rigging in the election." "Still we prefer a so-called elected government to a non-elected one, as a political government's behaviour is better than a non-elected one." "So we want to give the incoming government a chance," Delwar said. With the publication of election the results as gazette on Thursday, the newly-elected lawmakers are scheduled to be formally sworn in on Saturday and Sunday, a Jatiya Sangsad Secretariat official said on Friday. Asked whether the BNP chairperson had congratulated the winning AL-led grand alliance leader Sheikh Hasina, Delwar said she had not. "There is a tradition in our country  the winner consoles the defeated. So the winner should talk first with the defeated." A number of BNP leaders and supporters were present at the briefing. bdnews24
