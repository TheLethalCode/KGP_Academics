 Dhaka, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com)  Raising concerns of slow voting rate and "mismanagement", BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia had asked the Election Commission to extend the voting hours beyond 4pm. She made the request on Monday afternoon after seeing the voting process at Motijheel Ideal High School. She buffed news media reports about the four-party alliance candidates distributing money and materials to buy votes. "This allegation is untrue," she said after casting her vote at Adamjee Cantonment College. Commenting on the recovery of Tk 41 lakh from the car of a relative of a BNP candidate in Chittagong, she said, "That was money for business purposes." Khaleda visited Kurmitola Shaheen College, RAJUK Uttara Model College, Khilkhet-Kurmotola High School, Madhyabadda Jamatul Islamiya Orphanage, West Rampura Ekramunnessa Degree College and Kamlapur High School and Ideal School. bdnews2
