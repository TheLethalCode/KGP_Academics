 LONDON, Jan. 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Injury news ahead of this weekend's FA Cup third-round games: Wigan Athletic striker Amr Zaki is set to miss Friday's game at Tottenham Hotspur (2000) with a knee injury sustained in last week's league game against Bolton Wanderers. Wigan are already without Emile Heskey (hamstring), goalkeeper Chris Kirkland (groin) and the suspended Lee Cattermole. Spurs are without midfielder Tom Huddlestone, who has an ankle injury, while Jermaine Jenas is a doubt with a calf problem. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is likely to use several of the youngsters who have performed impressively in the League Cup for Saturday's home game against Plymouth Argyle (1500). Championship side (second division) Plymouth could give a debut to 20-year-old David Gray, who they have taken on loan from Manchester United, while leading scorer Paul Gallagher, also on loan from Blackburn Rovers, is hoping to recover from an ankle injury. Fullback David McNamee is suspended. Jermain Defoe, subject of intense transfer speculation, missed Portsmouth's training session on Friday through illness and could miss out on the first game of the Cup holders' defence of the trophy at home to Bristol City on Saturday (1500). Winger Craig Fagan could make his first start in four months for Hull City in the all-Premier League tie with Newcastle United (1500), four months after breaking his leg in the last minute of a league game between the clubs. Defender Anthony Gardner, also out since September with a thigh injury, could also return. Defender Sebastien Bassong should start for Newcastle after serving a suspension. Chelsea said on Friday they had given Wayne Bridge permission to talk to Manchester City about a possible transfer and the England full back is unlikely to feature in the club's home game against Southend on Saturday (1500)
