<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com)  Inspector general of police Nur Muhammad has expressed the hope that police will be able to work in an atmosphere which is free from political interference. "I hope police will not have to coax the ruling political parties in order to discharge their duties," the IGP said at a press briefing at the police headquarters in the city on Thursday. "I hope police will find it as easy to work in future as they did in the last two years." "Police could not work professionally under past political governments," he said. Nur Muhammad alleged that a newly elected leader in Jhenidah obstructed police when they tried to quell a violent clash. "Police intervened into the violence that erupted in Jhenidah where a sub-inspector was hurt," he informed. "A case will be filed in this regard and those responsible will be arrested. All criminals are the same in the eyes of police," he asserted. The IGP termed reported post-poll violence "stray incidents". Asked if the police personnel would remain interference-free and truly obey the orders from headquarters, the inspector general said, "What's the point of holding the post I am holding if police disobeys the headquarters." Emphasising a change in people's impression about the police Nur Muhammad said, "The negative attitude should change and people should see the humanitarian side of the police." "They have to work on holidays as they have to ensure people's safety during the holidays. They have to work 24 hours without enough benefits." "This all impacts their temperament, but how should they behave when they know you call them names?" Nur Muhammad asked that such negative attitudes to police should change to turn the police into a friendly force. bdnews
