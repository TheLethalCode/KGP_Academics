 Dhaka, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com)  The Washington-based National Democratic Institute has said its observer team along with other foreign observers were "unanimous" in their view that the Dec. 29 parliamentary election was a credible one. The observer team was asked by reporters on Wednesday whether they believed the ballot was rigged, amid allegations of "unprecedented rigging" by BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, whose four-party combine suffered disastrous defeat in the national ballot. "We have had discussions with other observers and it was an unanimous decision that the election was free and fair," said NDI polls team chief Howard B Schaffer at a press conference in Westin Hotel. In her first public reaction after the polls, Khaleda on Tuesday had claimed the election was "stage-managed." "With few exceptions, the elections were well administered and took place in a peaceful environment," said Schaffer, who served as US ambassador to Bangladesh in 1980s. He said the some voters faced problems in finding out the voting booths as their voter numbers in the list did not match the chits provided to them by the political parties. "A population that has been governed under an emergency order for the past two years appears eager for a return to elected government," he said. The institute had a fear, he said, that the military could have involvement on the election day. "Police and other security forces were present and engaged in maintaining a calm voting environment at all visited polling stations. "Observers reported that security personnel, including the military, behaved professionally and interfered only when necessary," said Schaffer. The delegation said the lines of women voters were longer than that of men. "In this election, marginalised groups were again underrepresented in the electoral process, but overall the delegation found very few instances of intimidation and no incidents of violence reported at the polling locations observed." The NDI deployed 60 polls observers who visited 270 polling booths at 185 polling centres across the country. As the official results were not announced, the NDI delegation refused to release a full report on the polls at the moment. "Indeed it is the people of Bangladesh who will determine the credibility of these elections and their significance for ongoing democratisation process," the former US envoy said. Former Canadian lawmaker Audry McLaughlin, former USAID official Larry Gobber and NDI director for Asia programme Peter Manikas were also present at the press conference. In her first public reaction after the national election Khaleda had claimed the election was "stage-managed." "The results of the staged election are not acceptable to BNP," she told reporters at a midnight press briefing after an emergency meeting of the party's national standing committee. She mentioned the unprecedented loss of party strongholds and fall of heavyweights as reasons to doubt the poll results. Khaleda pointed out that election officials had announced 40 to 50 percent voter turnout by noon on polling day, but she claimed, "during the rest of the day voting centres were almost vacant". The results announced showed 90 percent of votes cast, she said. "How did it happen?" Khaleda asked, before alleging that there was unprecedented vote rigging. bdnews
