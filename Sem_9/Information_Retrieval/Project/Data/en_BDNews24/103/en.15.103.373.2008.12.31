 Los Angeles, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters/Hollywood Reporter) - Hollywood hasn't had to resort to any post-Christmas half-off sales. Holiday releases -- ranging from warm puppy "Marley & Me" to kid-friendly "Bedtime Stories" to the luxe backward-running romance "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" -- attracted a stampede to the multiplex last weekend. So the studios will ring out 2008 on the strength of their current year-end lineup as the industry heads toward another record-setting domestic gross, thanks to higher ticket sales. With the coming New Year's holiday weekend serving as an opportunity for moviegoers to catch up with the film glut, including the awards-hopefuls still in limited release, no new wide openers will flood the already overcrowded theaters. Instead, Paramount Vantage will launch exclusive runs of its World War II Jewish resistance drama "Defiance" while ThinkFilm follows suit with its Nazi-era drama "Good." Directed by Ed Zwick, who also co-wrote the screenplay, "Defiance" is as much action picture as it is art house offering. Based on actual events, the movie stars Daniel Craig, Liev Schreiber and Jamie Bell as Jewish brothers who lead an encampment in the Belorussia forest. Paramount had planned to open the film wide in mid-December, but now it will roll out the picture for broader audiences on January 16. ThinkFilm will test the waters with exclusive openings of Vincente Amorim's "Good," an adaptation of the play by C.P. Taylor. The drama revolves around the relationship between Viggo Mortensen, playing a German literary professor whose work is taken up by the Nazis for propaganda purposes, and Jason Isaacs, who plays the professor's Jewish friend. Meanwhile, buoyed by good weekday numbers and potentially strong holds over the holiday weekend, overall domestic box office is poised to set a record. As of Sunday, 2008's year-to-date box office stood at $9.45 billion, according to Nielsen EDI. By the close of business Sunday -- bringing down the curtain on the box office year -- 2008 should surpass 2007's record haul of $9.62 billion by a couple of percentage points. The only caveat is that the record will be a result of rising ticket prices. The number of tickets sold is running 4%-5% behind last year's levels, which reached 1.41 billion. The market share crown will go to Warner Bros., which early this week crossed the $1.7 billion mark to edge past the previous studio record set by Sony in 2006. Warners, of course, got a boost from "The Dark Knight," the year's top-grossing film with nearly $531 million in domestic ticket sales. But the studio also benefited by absorbing downsized corporate sibling New Line Cinema, which contributed such hit titles as "Sex and the City," "Four Christmases" and "Journey to the Center of the Earth."
