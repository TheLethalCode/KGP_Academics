<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com)  Mashrafee Bin Mortaza struck a well-composed 63, his third Test fifty, to help Bangladesh avert follow-on, but Sri Lanka extended their overall lead to 189 at the close of the second day of the second and final Test in the port city on Sunday. Sri Lanka were 13 for no loss at stumps in the second innings after Bangladesh were bundled out for 208 in reply to the visitors' 384 all out in the first innings. Bangladesh conceded a 176-run deficit in the first innings at the Birsreshtha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium. The tail-ender batsman, Mashrafee taught the more acomplished batsmen of his side a lesson or two about how to play against the world-class bowling attack comprised of Muttiah Muralitharan, Ajantha Mendis, Chaminda Vaas, Dilhara Federnando. He struck eight fours, five off Muralitharan, and two sixes to carry his team from a hopeless 145 for nine. Shahadat Hossain gave him great company with an unbeaten five off 57 balls. They together put on 63 runs for the last wicket stand before Mashrafee went for a big one against Muralitharan to be caught at deep square leg by Fernando. Paceman Chaminda Vaas rattled the top order before mysterious spinner Ajantha Mendis wrecked the middle order to return four for 71. After being reduced to 65 for four, Mohammad Ashraful battled lonely to make 45, but his dismissal could come at a wrong time when the skipper needed to stay on the crease to inspire the rest of the batsmen. Ashraful went for a reverse-sweep against Muralitharan, who came in the attack in the 32nd over after Bangladesh top-order slumped, to give a catch to wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene. Bangladesh then were staring at the follow-on scare at 122 for seven. Mendis, who missed the Dhaka Test due to an ankle injury, was brought to attack in the 10th over of the innings and he justified the decision after Vaas made the inroad dismissing both openers. Tamim Iqbal edged Vaas to Pransana for a six-ball duck in the first over while the left-arm pacer trapped Imrul Kayes in front for a 24-ball six, leaving the hosts to 26 for two. Mendis, playing his fourth Test after grabbing 26 scalps in previous three matches, trapped Roqibul Hasan (seven-ball duck) in his second over and completed his first spell 11-3-14-1 with one-down Junaed Siddique and Ashraful playing him carefully. Junaed and Ashraful put on 32 runs for the fourth wicket before Dilhara Fernando swung sone superbly in the air to fool Junaed, uprooting his off stump for 28 off 89 balls. Afterwards, Ashraful pairing with Mehrab Hossain Junior was tried to steady the inngs damage. They made 25 runs for the fifth wicket before Mendis was reintroduced for the second spell. The 23-year old spinner struck again to trap Mehrab (18) and Shakib (0) lbws in two successive deliveries before Mushfiqur Rahim denied the bowler a rare hattrick. Ashraful gave away his wicket just before the tea break with Bangladesh on 131 for seven. Mushfiqur played both Muralitharan and Mendis carefully to make 21 off 43 balls before the wicketkeeper-batsman gave Mendis a charge down the wicket and was stumped. Enamul Haq Junior edged Muralitharan behind to Prasanna for a 19-ball four, leaving the side at 145 for nine, but Mashrafee and Shahadat kept their cool to steer the hosts beyond the 200-mark. Muralitharan chipped in with three for 64 while Vaas returned two for 21. Sri Lanka had earlier lasted just four overs in the morning to add only 13 runs to their overnight score of 371 for six in the face of a fierce spell from Shakib. He took three scalps for just one run to raise his wicket tally to four for 109. The visitors could hardly extend their lead as overnight batsman Chamaka Kapugedera fell to Shakib in the second over of the day. Kapugedera added only three runs to his overnight score of 93 to fall four runs short of his maiden century. The middle-order batsman struck 96 off 124 studded with 12 fours and one six. Paceman Mashrafee trapped another overnight batsman Chaminda Vaas for three while Shakib cleaned up the tail dismissing Muralitharan (0) and Fernando (0) in successive deliveries. Mashrafee returned three for 58. bd
