<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com)  Tillakaratne Dilshan struck a blistering 162 to overshadow Bangladesh's brilliant start to take Sri Lanka to a comfortable 371 for six at the close of the first day of the second and final Test at the Birsreshtha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium on Saturday. Bangladesh got off to a smashing start to reduce the visitors to 75 for four before Dilshan staged a great recovery in a two hundred-run partnerships with Malinda Warnapura and Chamara Kapugedera, who remained unbeaten on 93. After opting to bat on a slow pitch, the Sri Lankan top-order batsmen struggled to make shots, achieving an average of just 3.22 runs per over with the loss of four top batsmen, including Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene, until Dilshan rescued the side with a superb counterattack. Pace spearhead Mashrafee Bin Mortaza gave Bangladesh a blazing start, trapping makeshift opener Prasanna Jayawardene (first-ball duck) leg before in the very fourth delivery of the innings and in his second over, he bowled Sangakkara (seven-ball five) to reduce the visitors to seven for two. Left-arm spinner Shakib Al Hasan, man of the match of the Dhaka Test, joined the party dismissing Jayawardene, who had started his 100th Test match with 74 runs short of the 8000-run club. The Sri Lankan skipper scored a painstaking 11 off 46 balls before leaving the side at 39 for three and Bangladesh had a successful first session with three scalps with Sri Lanka on 65. Soon after lunch, Shahadat Hossain removed Thilan Samaraweera (19 off 41 balls) with Sri Lanka on a precarious 75 for four, but new batsman Dilshan eased the pressure to launch counterattack, backed up well by Warnapura and Kapugedera. Dilshan along with Warnapura negotiated the hosts' bowler well to put on 119 runs for the fifth wicket with an average of 5.06 per over before adding another significant 165 runs for the next wicket with Kapugedera with an average of 5.21 per over. With all regular bowlers failing to give Mohammad Ashraful a breakthrough, the skipper deployed himself to get a much-needed break, trapping Warnapura lbw in his very first delivery. Opener Warnapura played a patient 63 off 151 balls that included only three boundaries. Dilshan reached fifty off just 37 balls before steering Mashrafee to third man to lift up his sixth hundred off 97 balls with the helps of 14 fours and two sixes. Left-arm spinner Enamul Haq Junior finally bowled Dilshan, who played a destructive 162 off 165 balls studded with 21 fours and two sixes. Kapugedera was unbeaten on 93 off 117 balls studded with 12 fours and one six with Chaminda Vaas on one when the bails were drawn for Day 1. Sri Lanka made three changes from the squad that played the first test in Dhaka last week, with Chamara Kapugedera, Ajantha Mendis and Dilhara Fernando replacing Michael Vandort, Rangana Herath and Dammika Prasad respectively. Bangladesh also made a change as left-arm spinner Enamul Haque Jnr replaced paceman Mahbubul Alam. bdnews
