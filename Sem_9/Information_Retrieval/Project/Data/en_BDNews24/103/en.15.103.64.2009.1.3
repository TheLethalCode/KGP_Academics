<TITLE> EU gas supplies fall as Russia-Ukraine row deepens </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Kiev, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European Union countries were on alert on Saturday for further disruption to their gas supplies after Russia cut-off Ukraine in a row over pricing, and accused it of stealing gas bound for western markets. Russian state-controlled gas monopoly, Gazprom, halted supplies to Ukraine on New Year's Day, saying Ukraine had failed to pay its gas bill and that talks on 2009 gas prices had broken down. Romania's pipeline operator said supplies had fallen by 30-40 percent on Friday and Hungary and Poland also noted drops. The European Union, which gets a fifth of its gas from pipelines that cross Ukraine, said it would call a crisis meeting of envoys in Brussels on Monday and demanded that transit and supply contracts be honored. "Energy relations between the EU and its neighbors should be based on reliability and predictability," the Czech presidency of the 27-nation bloc said in a statement on Friday. Russia and Ukraine have insisted they will honor their commitments but Gazprom said Ukraine was stealing gas destined for Europe, a charge Ukraine's state-run gas company denied. Nevertheless, the European Union's fears of gas supply disruptions in the dead of winter have become a reality. Europe, where temperatures fell below freezing overnight, has enough gas stockpiled to manage without Russian supplies for several days but could face difficulties should problems last for weeks, analysts said. The disruptions are likely to undermine Russia's attempts to present itself as a stable energy supplier and fuel concerns that Moscow is trying to bully its neighbors just five months after the war with Georgia. PRICE ROW But failure to resolve the gas row quickly could also complicate ties between key European Union powers and Ukraine, whose President Viktor Yushchenko has angered the Kremlin by seeking to join the NATO military alliance. In an indication of how serious both Moscow and Kiev view the crisis, both sides had delegations touring European capitals to explain their positions. Alexei Miller, CEO of Gazprom, said on Thursday he wanted Ukraine to pay $418 per 1,000 cubic meters (tcm) of gas, compared with the $179.50 Kiev paid in 2008. Ukraine says the most it can afford to pay is $235 but only if Gazprom pays it more for gas transit. Gazprom says it already has a gas transit deal to 2010 and does not need to rework it. Gazprom says Ukraine owes it $600 million in fines for the late payment of $1.5 billion in gas bills. Ukraine's Naftogaz says it paid the $1.5 billion to an intermediary and Gazprom said it hopes to get that payment on January 11. Ukraine, facing a deep recession, says it can ill afford to pay higher prices for its gas. President Yushchenko and Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who are locked in a battle for influence, would likely be loath to explain to voters why gas bills have to be raised again. Ukrainians on the street in Kiev seemed to blame their own politicians for failing to get a deal with Russia. "This is just bandits sitting in the Kremlin arguing, deciding, talking to bandits sitting in Grushevska street," Oleg Karlichyk a plumber in his mid-30s going on his way to work, said referring to the seats of power in Moscow and Kiev.
