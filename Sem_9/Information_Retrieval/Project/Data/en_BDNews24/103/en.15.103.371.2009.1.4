 Dhaka, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com)  Outgoing commerce and education adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said the interim government has resolved problems during its tenure through dialogue with parties and at grass roots levels. "Future uncertainties also could be resolved if this culture is adopted by the next government," he said. Talking to reporters after a farewell meeting with business chiefs at the commerce ministry Zillur said, "The next government should not just focus on control measures, it should also undertake promotional activities." "The government will have to look into both domestic and foreign trade but market will be the dominant factor, which is why our government has activated the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh and expects the incoming government will continue the process." An FBCCI delegation led by its president Annisul Huq paid a farewell visit to the adviser at the latter's secretariat office on Sunday. Commerce secretary Firoz Ahmed who was also present at that time said the FBCCI delegation in its farewell meeting praised different positive measures taken during his tenure as a commerce adviser and thanked him for the measures. About the meeting Hossain Zillur said, "We told them that we've wrapped up our assignments, advised them about raising institutional skills and urged them to come forward during the crisis period when the nation needs their help." "We've seen that positive measures yield good results winning people's confidence," the adviser said adding that there is a boost in people's confidence. "This confidence will enable the new government to solve more problems," he said. bdnew
