<TITLE> Juve's Amauri says he may snub Brazil or Italy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ROME, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Juventus striker Amauri said he may end the controversy over whether he should play for Brazil or Italy by snubbing whoever calls him up. The Brazilian-born 28-year-old is applying for an Italian passport and had previously said he would like to play for the world champions if he continues to be overlooked by his home country. As things stand, he would be eligible to play for Italy, where he has spent almost all of his senior career, when his passport comes through as he has never represented his homeland. Italy coach Marcello Lippi said he will consider Amauri when he becomes eligible, while Brazil coach Dunga made things more interesting last week by saying he intended to call up the Juve man. "It seems like I want to put myself up for auction between Dunga and Lippi," he told Italian daily La Repubblica (www.repubblica.it). "As that's not the case, this is the last time I'll address the subject. I won't open my mouth again until I receive an official call-up from one side or the other, if that happens. "At that point I'll give my answer, which could be negative. I arrived at Juventus on my own legs, as a perfect unknown. That means I don't need a national team". In the past Lippi had expressed irritation at Amauri's failure to commit himself to one national team or another, while AC Milan's Filippo Inzaghi said this week that an Azzurri place should not be a standby option. Amauri has been in impressive form since joining Juve from Palermo in the close season, scoring 11 goals in Serie A this season. Italy face Brazil in a friendly at the Emirates Stadium in London on Feb 10
