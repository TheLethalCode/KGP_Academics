 Dhaka, Jan 4(bdnews24.com)With just 48 hours left until handover of power, advisers of the outgoing caretaker government have begun to take their departures with farewells ringing throughout the secretariat. Though some outgoing advisers and special assistants to the chief adviser were preparing to leave their respective offices on Sunday, others say they will continue with their duties until Tuesday, when the new cabinet led by Sheikh Hasina will be sworn in. Three advisers took official leave of their respective ministries on Sunday, while another was given a farewell by the apex body of the business community, the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Outgoing adviser Dr CS Karim on Sunday addressed an emotional crowd of agriculture scientists, extension officials and ministry mandarins who called him a hard-to-follow example of a cabinet minister. "His two years at the helm (of the ministry) has us to new heights. Dr Karim will continue to inspire us," said agriculture secretary Sheikh Enayetullah. BARC chairman Dr Harunur Rashid paid tribute on behalf of the scientists, and officers from Agriculture Information Service refused to call it a farewell. They came with a big cake, saying they were celebrating the fantastic two-years of Dr Karim who oversaw a turnaround in the wake of two consecutive floods, a super cyclone and an unprecedented global food crisis. Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman was met in his office by a delegation of business heads Sunday led by FBCCI president Anisul Huq. Commerce secretary Feroze Ahmed said the FBCCI delegation arrived to bid farewell to Hossain Zillur and thank him for his work over the past one year. Zillur told them it was the business community who must come forward during national crises. Zillur will continue his duties until Tuesday, he said. Officials of the land ministry said adviser Hasan Ariff took leave of them Sunday, while communication and housing adviser Golam Qader took leave of the two ministries under him. Both ministries held separate functions for Qader who urged officials to carry on their work considering the interests of the people and the state. bdnew
