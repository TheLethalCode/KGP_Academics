 Dhaka, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com)--Head of the European Union election observation mission (EOM) Alexander Graf Lambdorff Monday said "conditions for a credible poll" were in Bangladesh. After witnessing some polling stations and vote counting at Dhaka University, a satisfied Lambdorff said if the polling across the country was like that of the centres he visited, the 150 member EOM would be happy. "I have followed the process indeed from morning to evening and our team will continue to follow even after the counting when the results will be transferred to the returning officers," Lambdorff told reporters watching vote counting at Curzon Hall at Dhaka University. "I think that what we have seen on polling day so far has shown that the conditions for a credible poll in Bangladesh are in place," he said. He said his team would be collecting information from the members of the EOM from across the country and make a preliminary statement on 31 December. "What I have seen personally as one of the 150 European observers today has given me a degree of satisfaction and hope that the voting process will continue like that. "As far as today is concerned, I believe what I have seen at least has drawn satisfactory. And I hope if this is the case across the country, the reports that I have had around mid day today from our team showed that they were satisfied," he said. Lambsdorff went to Shuritulla Model School centre and Ispahani High School in Keraniganj to see the transparency of the voting process. bdn
