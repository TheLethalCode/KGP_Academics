A second letter sent two days later threatened to blow up the house if police were asked for help. Police sent 45 commandos to keep watch. On Tuesday, Dhoni arrived in his hometown Ranchi in Jharkhand, one of country's poorest states, but has since left for Mumbai. "Three people have been arrested in connection with the extortion and threat letters written to Indian cricket captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni," a state police official told Reuters. "We have interrogated more than seven people in connection with two letters." Ibrahim is accused of masterminding the country's most deadly bombings in 1993, which killed at least 250 people in Mumbai.
