 Dhaka, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad on Friday said people and his supporters want him as president, hours after the Awami League said it wanted Zillur Rahman to assume the largely ceremonial post. "[As a key ally of Awami League-led grand alliance], my being president is the demand of the people of the country and ours as well," the former president told reporters. He pressed his case at a programme marking the 24th founding anniversary of the party at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh. Ershad, however, said the AL was yet to invite him to discussion about the presidency and the cabinet. AL general secretary Abdul Jalil had said the party leaders and supporters wanted to see veteran Zillur as titular head of state once the new government was sworn in. Asked about the AL's wish, Ershad said, "I'm senior to Zillur Rahman." He declined comment when asked what would his next move be if he was not given the presidency. At the programme, Ershad claimed his party had helped whip up massive public support in favour of the grand alliance in the Dec. 29 election due to the JP's involvement. On joining the cabinet, Ershad told his supporters they would meet in a couple of days to make a decision. "I'll decide on whether we'll go to the government." JP secretary general Ruhul Amin Hawladar said, "Our leaders and supporters want to see HM Ershad as president." "We'd an electoral slogan that Awami League president Sheikh Hasina will be prime minister and Ershad will be president. " It snatched the victory for grand alliance," he claimed JP central leader Kazi Zafar Ahmed referred to an "agreement" between the JP and AL on making Ershad president should the grand alliance was elected to power. "So whether we'll be with the government or break up (from the alliance), will be decided after the presidency is settled," Zafar said. JP acting president Anisul Islam Mahmud also backed Ershad to become the head of state. bdnew
