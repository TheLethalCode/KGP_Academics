<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Jan 5 (bdnews24.com)  Fifties from Tillakaratne Dilshan, Thilan Samaraweera and Kumar Sangakkara powered Sri Lanka to an overall lead of 472 at the close of the third day of the second and final Test against Bangladesh on Monday. The visitors with a first innings lead of 176 were 296 for four in the second innings when bails were drawn for Day 3 at Chittagong's Birsreshtha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium. Samaraweera and Dilshan together contributed 131 for the unbroken fifth wickets to put Sri Lanka on course for a series win after Sangakkara played a slow but timely 54 off 104 balls studded with four fours. Dilshan, who rescued the visitors in the first innings with a swashbuckling 162, was again in the centre to lead the side from the front with an unbeaten 81 while Samaraweera, who initially struggled to find his feet, played a patient 72 not out. Both batsmen struck eight fours in their innings. On a tricky pitch that initially offered a considerable assistance to the spinners, the Bangladesh bowlers struggled against the visitors though occasional leg-spinner Mohammad Ashraful made the inroads twice in the innings. Overnight batsmen Malinda Warnapura and Prasanna Jayawardene faced off Bangladesh pace duo Mashrafee Bin Mortaza and Shahadat Hossain to make a confident start early in the morning, putting on 50 runs for the opening stand looking to build on overnight lead of 189. Bangladesh skipper Ashraful drew the first blood attacking in the 10th over of the day and in his next over he had Prasanna caught at short midwicket by Shakib Al Hasan for 28. Next over, Shahadat came back strongly, trapping overnight batsman Warnapur in front for 27 before Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene steadied the innings with a third-wicket 68-run partnership. Left-arm spinner Enamul Haq Junior dismissed Mahela Jayawardene for 22 after lunch while Ashraful struck again to send back Sangakkara before tea. But Dilshan along with Samraweera stepped up for Sri Lanka achieving 3.55 runs per over to keep the host bowlers at bay. Ashraful employed seven bowlers in total, though the effort went in vain as the skipper grabbed two wickets for 29 and Shahadat Hossain and Enamul Haq Junior took just one wicket apiece for 67 and 66 respectively. Sri Lanka added 286 to their overnight score of 13 for no loss at the cost of four wickets. bd
