 Dhaka, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com) - The Election Commission had unofficially declared the poll results of 297 of 299 constituencies up to Tuesday night. Results of two seats are yet to be announced due to allegations of irregularities. Voting in Noakhali-3 former was suspended during Monday's national vote after attempts to 'snatch ballot boxes'. In Chittagong-16 the husband of a candidate was arrested for 'attempting to influence voting'. However, the vote counts so far showed BNP candidates ahead in both constituencies. In Noakhali-3 BNP candidate Md Barkat Ullah Bulu was leading his nearest rival, independent Md Mamunur Rashid Kiron, by 98,537 votes to 74,246 with the count in just one of 17 centres to be declared. Chittagong-16 sees BNP's Mostafa Kamal Pasha ahead of rival independent Mahfuzur Rahman by 61,154 votes to 32,007, with results out in 76 of 79 centres. Election to Noakhali-1 has been deferred to Jan. 12 due to the death of a candidate in early December. bdnews2
