 Dhaka, January 5 (bdnews24.com)The new cabinet to be sworn in Tuesday will be "a mix of the old and the young", said a senior Awami League leader on Monday, but giving no hint of probable names to be included. "The cabinet this time will be medium-sized. Finalising the selections is on. Tomorrow you'll see how many and who constitute the cabinet," said HT Imam told reporters waiting outside Sudha Sadan Monday morning. While Imam tried to appease the curiosity of reporters, he avoided uttering names of any of the would-be cabinet members due to be sworn in Tuesday evening. "The new cabinet will be a mix of the old and the young," said Imam. "And, of course, it will contain technocrats too." Asked if any controversial individuals or graft accused will be included, he said, "Well, you will be able to know all very soon. Just wait a little." "The ministers will take the oath Tuesday. The portfolio distribution will be done subsequently." Imam said the grand alliance has yet to forward any list of names of proposed ministers to the cabinet division. "We will send the list on receipt of the presidential invitation regarding this," said Imam. bdnews2
