 Dhaka, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com)  MPs-designate of BNP and its allies did not take oaths on Sunday. BNP office secretary Rizvi Ahmed, just hours before a scheduled afternoon swearing-in ceremony, said "The BNP lawmakers are not going to be sworn in on Sunday afternoon." "The party policy makers' decision in this regard will be publicised as and when necessary.," Rizvi told bdnews24.com at around midday. More than one senior BNP leader, however, has hinted that the BNP MPs-elect will be taking the oath sometime this week, if not on Sunday. BNP's other allies, Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami and Bangladesh Jatiya Party secured two and one seats in the Dec. 29 polls. Jamaat assistant secretary general M Qamaruzzaman told bdnews24.com their lawmakers would take oath after consulting BNP. BJP chairman Andalib Rahman told bdnews24.com, "The four-party alliance MPs-elect will not take oath [Sunday] afternoon. Our alliance leader Khaleda Zia will decide when we should do that." LDP and four independent lawmakers will duly go for oath taking on Sunday. The Awami League-led grand alliance MPs were sworn in on Saturday afternoon as scheduled. On Saturday, Rizvi had said there had been no party decision on whether the newly-elected 27 deputies would take oath. "We haven't had a decision as yet. The media will be informed as soon as we have it," Rizvi had told a regular briefing at the BNP chairperson's Gulshan office. BNP won 29 seats in the Dec. 29 election, but has sought to dispute widely-proclaimed view that it was fair vote. Party leaders have, however, made it clear that the BNP MPs will take oath, join the sessions and "play the role of a constructive opposition". Khaleda, who bagged all three she contested, has already said she will give up the two Bogra seats, retaining her long-held Feni constituency. BNP will, therefore, have 27 MPs. Rizvi also rubbished reports that BNP was withdrawing candidates for the Upazila elections slated for Jan. 22. "BNP will participate in the Upazila polls." The BNP official also gave an account of "attacks on the BNP supporters, vandalisation of their political offices, homes and shops." Sitting with Rizvi were, among others, former BNP MPs Ilyas Ali and Nazimuddin Alam. bdnews24.com/
