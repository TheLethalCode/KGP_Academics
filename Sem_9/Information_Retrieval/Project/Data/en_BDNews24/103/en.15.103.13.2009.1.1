 Dhaka, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com)  President Iajuddin Ahmed has asked the incoming government to take measures to tackle fallouts of the current global economic meltdown. "In view of the global recession, I would urge the new government to take necessary steps, including developing our own economy," he said, inaugurating the Dhaka International Trade Fair 2009 at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Centre. The fair has been arranged by the Ministry of Commerce and the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB). "The international trade fair allows us a comparison between local and foreign products," said the president. "In recent times, along with the traditional export items, pharmaceuticals, textiles, ship building and others have emerged as potential export sectors." "To accelerate the economy, more attention must be attached to export trade." The president, asking the organisers to ensure that the fair was accessible, said, "Visitors must be allowed to move about freely." "We have a bright future," commented adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman. "Our entrepreneurs and a newly-elected government are ready to take the economy forward." "Hopefully, we will be successful," he said. At the opening, commerce secretary Feroz Ahmed, president of the Bangladesh Industries and Traders' Association Anisul Huq, Sri Lankan ambassador to Bangladesh Dhikkrishna Moorty, among others, were present. "The fair will remain open every day from 10am until 10pm," said EPB vice chairman Md Sahabullah. The fair will feature five special, four premium, 52 general, two premium mini and 45 mini pavillions. In addition, there will be 35 premium stalls, 312 general stalls and 12 restaurants. Organisations from 12 countries including Germany, USA, Japan, China, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Thailand, India and Pakistan are taking part in the fair, said the vice chairman. The entry fee for adults (above 12) and minors (3-12 years) will be Tk 12 and Tk 7, respectively. "The entry fee has been increased as the price of construction materials has risen," said Sahabullah. bdnew
