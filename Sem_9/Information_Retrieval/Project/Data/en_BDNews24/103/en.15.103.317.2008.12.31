<TITLE> Fast decision on primary energy vital for GDP growth: Tamim </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com)  Quick decision on the primary energy is vital, without which power crisis will remain as demand for energy rises with the GDP growing, a special assistant to chief adviser said on Wednesday. "We have to set up coal-fired power plants as we still face gas crisis," M Tamim, who is in charge of ministry of power, energy and mineral resources, said at the launch of Second East-West Power Transmission Line in Sirajganj. "A volume of 400-500 megawatt power can be produced by coals from Boropukuria coal mine and if those are extracted, power production will jump." He also said the government signed a deal for generating around 1000 MW power, of which production of 400 megawatt has started and by June, the rest 600 megawatt would be produced. "We could not provide additional power to the eastern zone for lack of inter-transmission line," said M Fauzul Kabir Khan, secretary to the energy ministry. "I hope it would be resolved soon," said Kabir. Highlighting the interim government's short-term decision in power production, he said, "The new government will not need to bother for new decisions over short-time power production." "They will get a lot of time to take short and long-term decisions." A transmission line link east with west was established in 1982 with a generation capacity of 300 megawatt, he said, adding that its capacity fell. Echoing Tamim, he said he believed the voltage problem in the eastern zone would be resolved by the new transmission line. bdnew
