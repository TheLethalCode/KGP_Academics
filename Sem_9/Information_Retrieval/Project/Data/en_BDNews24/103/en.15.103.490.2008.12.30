 By Sumon K Chakrabarti New Delhi, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com)  India has hailed the historic victory of the Awami League-led grand alliance, calling the elections a "major landmark in democratic politics in South Asia". Congratulating Dhaka on the fair, peaceful and free conduct of the general elections, India has observed that the return to multi-party democratic politics is going to chart a new future for Bangladesh. "The large turnout of voters and the successful conduct of elections is a resounding victory for democracy," said Indian foreign ministry spokesman Vishnu Prakash on Tuesday. "The people of Bangladesh have spoken with one voice to reiterate their faith in the democratic process and their desire for development and progress," he added. The Indian government made it clear that Hasina's victory had come as a huge relief to New Delhi. In the last few years, more and more terror attacks were suspected to have been planned across the eastern border of India in Bangladesh. There was growing evidence, as claimed by the Indians, of Bangladeshi soil being used by terrorist groups, Indian insurgents and even Pakistan's spy agency Inter-Service Intelligence. Unlike her political rivals, Hasina had promised to crack down on homegrown terror groups as well as Indian separatist groups. He pointed out that India and Bangladesh shared common values, a commitment to democracy and a multi-faceted historical relationship. New Delhi now hopes to "work closely with the newly elected Government in Bangladesh to further strengthen our bonds of friendship and cooperation in the quest for peace and development." bd
