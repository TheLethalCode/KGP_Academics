<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com)  The simmering tension between Awami League and Jatiya Party over the largely ceremonial presidency boiled over into a full-blown battle on Friday, a day before their MPs take oath to office. Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad on Friday said the nation and his supporters wanted to see him become president, hours after AL general secretary Abdul Jalil had said they wanted to see veteran Zillur Rahman as titular head of state. Jalil told bdnews24.com, "We would like Zillur Rahman to become president and the Awami League president Sheikh Hasina prime minister." The post of head of state has been the bone of contention between the big two in the grand alliance in the days leading to the general election. Elected MPs of AL, JP and other splinter parties are set to take oath on Saturday. The AL won a staggering 230 seats out of 299 on offer, with JPO taking 27 and others five so far. Ershad broke up with the AL-led alliance after talks to settle the share of seats to put up candidates had failed. He had rushed a news conference to break the news and also said he wanted presidency, in a veiled reference that AL was non-committal about the demand. "[As a key ally of Awami League-led grand alliance], my being president is the demand of the people of the country and ours as well," the former president told reporters on Friday. He pressed his case at a programme marking the 24th founding anniversary of the party at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh. The former president, however, said the AL was yet to invite him to discussion about the presidency and the cabinet. Asked about the AL's wish, Ershad said, "I'm senior to Zillur Rahman." He declined comment when asked what would his next move be if he was not given the presidency. At the programme, Ershad claimed his party had helped whip up massive public support in favour of the grand alliance in the Dec. 29 election due to the JP's involvement. JP secretary general Ruhul Amin Hawladar said, "Our leaders and supporters want to see HM Ershad as president." "We'd an electoral slogan that Awami League president Sheikh Hasina will be prime minister and Ershad will be president. "It snatched the victory for grand alliance," he claimed bdnews24.
