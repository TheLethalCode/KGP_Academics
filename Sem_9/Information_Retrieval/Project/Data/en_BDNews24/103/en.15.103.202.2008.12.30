 Dhaka, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Party chief HM Ershad looked to be coming out on top in all three seats he was contesting, bringing his party's total to some 12 out of 46 seats under the grand alliance by 2.30am Tuesday. Ershad had won in two out of three of his constituencies, Kurigram-2 and Rangpur-3, though Dhaka-17 was not expected to be declared till later. He swept a massive 1,25,000 votes in Rangpur-3, according to early results though the offical results were still to be declared. JP's AKM Mostafizur Rahman won in Kurigram-1. His nearest rival was Saidur Rahman Rana, a four-party alliance candidate. Jafar Ahmed Siddiqui bagged Nilphamari-1, beating four-party alliance candidate Rafiqul Islam. In Nilphamari-3 Kazi Faruk Kader beat four-party alliance candidate Md Azizul Islam. MA Jabbar won Satkhira-2, beating runner up Md Abdul Khaleque of the four-party alliance. JP leader Rawshan Ershad lost in two constituencies in Gaibandha-5 and Mymensingh-4. Momtaj Iqbal won in Sunamganj-4. JP chairman HM Ershad had estimated that his party would get at least 30 seats and, if the election was held properly, the grand alliance would go to power. "I am happy to have been able to vote as a free person," said Ershad as he cast the first vote in Rangpur-3 at the Senapara Government Primary High School in the morning. Optimistic about his chances, he had said, "I shall win in all three seats." The JP chief did not vote in the previous parliamentary elections, and could not contest in the 2001 elections due to legal complications. In 1991 and 1996 he ran in polls as a prisoner, and in both cases he won five seats. bd
