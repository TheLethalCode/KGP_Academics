<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League general secretary Abdul Jalil said on Friday party leaders and supporters want to see veteran Zillur Rahman as president of the state once the AL-led coalition government is sworn in. "We like Zillur Rahman to be president and the Awami League president Sheikh Hasina will be the prime minister," Jalil told bdnews24.com. Jalil hinted that the size of the AL-led grand coalition government would not be "too large" and that young lawmakers would also sit in the cabinet. "The number of the cabinet members will be between 40 and 45 and it will be blended with the veterans' experience and youths' merit," Jalil said. Zillur, the AL presidium member, was elected from Kishoreganj-6 constituency in the Dec. 29 general election. The AL won a staggering 230 seats out of 299 on offer, with its allies securing a further 32 seats. Since the military-installed caretaker government took over in Jan. 2007, Zillur discharged the duties of acting AL president while Hasina was abroad and in jail on graft and murder charges. A lawyer, Zillur was also the party's general secretary for two terms with independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who led the country's liberation war in 1971 as the AL president, and with his daughter, Hasina. His wife Ivy Rahman, a senior AL leader, died in a grenade attack on Hasina's rally on August 21, 2004 on Bangabandhu Avenue in the capital along with 23 others. With the publication of election the results as gazette on Thursday, the AL expected that the new AL-led government will be formed by Jan. 7. The Jatiya Sangsad Secretariat secretary Ashfaque Hamid on Friday said the newly-elected lawmakers are scheduled to be formally sworn in on Saturday and Sunday. "The gazette of the ninth parliamentary elections results has reached the Jatiya Sangsad secretariat," he told bdnews24.com at noon by telephone. Hamid said all preparations for administering the oath in the 'oath' chamber of parliament building have been completed. bdnews24.
