 The Prime Minister-elect, Sheikh Hasina, says she will attack poverty as Bangladesh's "number one enemy", but that her first task will be to bring prices to the poor's reach. In her first, formal public statement since a landslide win in Monday's election, Hasina Wednesday offered an olive branch to her arch-rivals, asking them to be partners in running the country. She said she would not even have a problem with an opposition member in her cabinet. Hasina to attack poverty, offers opponents key role Dhaka, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com)Prime Minister-elect Sheikh Hasina, in her first, formal public statement since a historic landslide in Monday's election, said she would target poverty as Bangladesh's "number one enemy" but that her first task would to bring prices to the poor's reach. In line with her pre-polls pledges, Hasina promised to take parliamentary opposition into confidence and said she would not have a problem with choosing ministers from beyond the treasury bench. Hasina sought the copperation of her political rival BNP chief Khaleda Zia in running the state affairs. "She is also a former prime minister, she has experience in running the country. We want cooperation from all," she said. She stressed the role of the opposition in future governance, and urged all political parties "to work together forgetting all divisions". "Our greatest, our number one enemy is poverty," said Hasina, speaking Wednesday to a packed hall at the Bangladesh-China Conference Centre. "Our first task will be to lower prices of commodities to bring them within the reach of the poor. "We want to avoid destructive and divisive politics," said the AL chief about to enter her second term as prime minister. "We will ensure the role and participation of the opposition in parliament and governance." She said not only would the deputy speaker be an opposition member but chairs of parliamentary standing committees would be picked to proportionally represent all parties. When asked whether she would choose ministers from among opposition MPs, she pointed out that her previous cabinet included two opposition members. "Of course, I don't have a problem with that," said the head of the multi-party alliance that won a phenomenal 262 of 299 seats in Monday's parliamentary poll. The victory was not only her party's or the grand alliance's, she said. "It's a victory for non-communal democracy against communalism," Hasina said. "It's a victory of (people's aspiration for) good governance against misrule ... of peace against terrorism." As she defined poverty as her number one enemy and fixing cost of living as her first task, she was asked about her number one friend. "People of Bangladesh," Hasina said, instantaneously. She thanked voters, especially women and first time voters, for their enthusiastic participation in the much-awaited Dec 29 election. "I thank all who exercised their voting right, those who voted for us and those who voted for other parties, as the participation of all made for a free, fair and credible election," said Hasina. Hasina, flanked by party election committee chiefs Zillur Rahman and HT Imam, was half hidden behind a raft of microphones as she gave a well-worded and well-received statement in the televised press conference on Wednesday morning. An earlier press conference scheduled for the previous afternoon at the National Press Club was deferred at the last moment for a shift to the much larger-capacity hall of the city's biggest conference centre. At one point, an audience member, citing John McCain's call to US president-elect Barack Obama, asked whether Hasina's long-time political rival Khaleda had called to congratulate her. The AL chief hinted that she had not received such a call as yet. Asked if she called to "felicitate" Khaleda, Hasina replied: "Well, frankly speaking, how would it be? I thought of calling, I even picked up the phone a few times..." She said she had thought of sending Khaleda a bouquet and decided against it fearing rejection. She added she did not know what she would do if the BNP chief reacted adversely. Hasina's speech came hours after Khaleda had rejected the Dec 29 results alleging "unprecedented" vote rigging. At a midnight press briefing Tuesday, the BNP chief dismissed the outcome  her party reduced to a paltry 29 from a two-thirds majority in previous parliament as "stage-managed". The two-time former prime minister also mockingly thanked the chief election commissioner for 'the feat'. Asked about the AL's manifesto pledge to deal with energy crisis, Hasina said her government would use the 1996-2001 experience to increase power output to the promised level. "We'll explore all optionsfrom coal to solar to wind to hydroelectricity to nuclear power," the former prime minister said. Replying to other questions from newsmen on Bangladesh's role in South Asia security, Hasina referred to the party manifesto's promise of forming a joint task force to counter terrorism. "The key to all instability in this region is terrorism." She told a questioner that she would "do anything and everything within my capacity to ease tensions between India and Pakistan". "We will not let our land to be used against any neighbour," she said, in reply to an Indian journalist's mention of New Delhi's past allegations of Dhaka 'harbouring terrorists'. Asked whether her government would really try the war criminals of 1971, she replied in the positive. "They received the verdict of the people," Hasina said, in a veiled reference to the near wipe-out of BNP ally Bangladesh Jamaat -e-Islami in the just concluded election. Jamaat has been reduced to just two seats in what is widely believed to be the voters' rejection of those who opposed Bangladesh's independence war in 1971. Replying to a question from a Europe-based Myanmar journalist, Hasina demanded freedom for the country's long-detained democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi. She, however, hastened to add that her party believed in "friendship with all, enmity with none, especially with neighbouring countries". "But I do not support political oppression" said the former prime minister who herself spent months in jail between 2007-08 on graft charges brought by the caretaker government as did rival Khaleda Zia. The AL chief 'guaranteed' that no MP of her ruling party or coalition members would engage in corruption, in answer to a query on tackling abuse of power by her fellows. "I can tell you one thing that they will never misuse power, we want to ensure our country and its people a better life," she said, adding that the previous AL rule was "the golden period of Bangladesh in all aspects''. Hasina was all praises for the law-enforcers on duty during the polls, commended the election officials, and thanked the caretaker government for organising the "free and fair" vote. She also thanked the armed forces for helping the Election Commission prepare a voter roll with photos. bdnews2
