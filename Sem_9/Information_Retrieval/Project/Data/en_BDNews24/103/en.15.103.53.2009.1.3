 WELLINGTON, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The touring West Indies beat New Zealand by five wickets with 1 ball remaining in a weather-affected second one-day international in Christchurch on Saturday. Led by Ramnaresh Sarwan's unbeaten 67, West Indies scored 158 for five off 27.5 overs to clinch the win in a match interrupted for four hours by rain, hail and thunderstorms. With the first match washed out, the victory gave West Indies a 1-0 lead in the series with the third ODI scheduled for Jan. 7 in Wellington. New Zealand had racked up 152 for eight in their innings as they struggled with a soggy outfield and a tight West Indies fielding display. New Zealand's score meant the tourists needed 158 to win, in accordance with the Duckworth-Lewis system, with overs restricted to 28 each side. New Zealand had been buoyed by a dominant performance in the rain-abandoned first ODI on New Year's Eve but got off to a poor start when Fidel Edwards had Brendon McCullum caught behind for one early on, setting the tone for the rest of the day. Jesse Ryder was the top scorer for New Zealand with 32, while Jacob Oram hit a six and two boundaries before going out for 25, caught by Sewnarine Chattergoon off an Edwards delivery. Edwards claimed another victim immediately after when he bowled New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori out for a duck to finish three for 26 off his maximum six overs. The hosts had cause to celebrate when Tim Southee bowled left-handed opener Chattergoon for just six runs to put the tourists at 14 for one but by the time the next wicket, Chris Gayle, came West Indies had put on 61 runs and were looking more comfortable. Oram took Xavier Marshall's wicket soon afterwards, however, leaving West Indies on 68-3 and momentum swung again. New Zealand were favourites when the West Indies needed 40 off the last four overs, but Denesh Ramdin knocked off 21 runs off his next 10 balls to put the visitors on course. Sarwan's unbeaten 67 did most to dent New Zealand's hopes, and he and Ramdin (28 not out) guided the tourists home by the narrowest of margins
