 Dhaka, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com)  A wintry morning turned sunny as voters across Bangladesh queued up in holiday mood from 8am Monday, hoping for a peaceful return to democracy after almost two years of emergency rule. As usual, Election Day has been a government holiday, with voters queuing up at polling centres from early morning, and later spilling out onto the streets that were pleasantly free of traffic. "Polling will continue up to 5pm, uninterrupted," Huda told bdnews24.com. The CEC in a televised speech on Sunday evening assured the nation of all necessary preparations for a free and fair election, inviting all to apply their voting rights without fear. "I'm inviting all voters, regardless of political differences, to go to polling centres taking the opportunity of the secure environment to cast their invaluable votes," the CEC said. This was Bangladesh's 9th parliamentary election since independence, and the first national vote in seven years. BNP chief and two-time former prime minister Khaleda Zia stepped down at the end of her five-year term on Oct. 28, 2006. Iajuddin Ahmed was sworn in next day as head of a caretaker government. But the Jan. 22, 2007 general election was postponed amid allegations by the Awami League and its allies that BNP had stacked the Election Commission with partisans and stuffed the voter rolls with 1.4 crore fake names. A state of emergency was imposed on Jan. 11, with certain fundamental rights suspended and a nighttime curfew imoposed. President Iajuddin Ahmed then resigned as the head of the caretaker government entrusted to run the polls. A military-installed interim government headed by Fakhruddin Ahmed lifted the state of emergency on Dec. 17. Noakhali-1 constituency will hold its poll on Jan. 12, deferred after the death of Awami League-led grand alliance candidate Nurul Islam.
