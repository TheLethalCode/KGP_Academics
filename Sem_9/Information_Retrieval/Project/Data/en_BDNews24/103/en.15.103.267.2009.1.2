 LONDON, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United have agreed to sign Partizan Belgrade midfield duo Zoran Tosic and Adem Ljajic, the Premier League champions said on Friday. Tosic, 21 and a Serbia international, will sign with immediate effect while an agreement is in place for 17-year-old Ljajic, who had a trial at United last year, to remain with Partizan for the rest of 2009, United said on their website (www.manutd.com). No transfer fees were given but British media had speculated that United would pay a combined fee of around 16 million pounds ($23.31 million). "Tosic joins us immediately, his work permit is through," manager Alex Ferguson told Sky Sports News. "He's a wide left player and we like wide players at this club. We've been watching him for over a year. Hopefully he'll do well. "He's not played since December 10 and he'll need time to adjust and we'll give him that. "The other boy is 17 but he's a very good player. When we bring in young players we always think we can develop them." As to any further spending, Ferguson said: "That's the end of transfer business for Manchester United this season.
