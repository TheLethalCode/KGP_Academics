 Dhaka, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com)  A positive Bangladesh conceded a 107-run defeat in the first Test against Sri Lanka despite posting their fourth innings highest of 413 on the final day at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Wednesday. Chasing an improbable target of 521, captain Mohammad Ashraful struck 101, his fifth Test hundred, fourth against Sri Lanka, and Shakib Al Hasan hit a career-best 96 as Bangladesh eclipsed their previous best of 285 for five against Zimbabwe. A brave Bangladesh having resumed the day on 254 for five added 159 runs to finish at an impressive 413 all out, the fifth time Bangladesh passed the 400-mark in an innings. All Bangladesh batsmen showed positive attitude from the word go in the second innings and gave the Lankans a scare or two much before slipping on way to their 51st defeat in 58 games. Bangladesh needed to break the West Indies' highest run-chase record of 418 against Australia to win the match and it had a glimpse hope for the hosts though the batsmen raised an amazing dream in their positive batting approach, led by Ashraful. The youngest Test centurion, resuming on overnight score of 70, threatened the visitors to reach hundred soon after resumption before Chaminda Vaas trapped him leg before for 101 to give Mahela Jayawardene a much-needed break. Ashraful, who put on 112 runs for the sixth wicket, struck 16 fours off 193 balls in his well-composed innings. Shakib looked steady, calm on the way to his career-best innings with contributing two hundred-run partnerships with Ashraful and Mushfiqur Rahim, but the left-handed batsman could not take him beyond the 100-run mark. Shakib, pairing with Mushfiqur, rewrote a new seventh-wicket partnership record of 111, erasing the previous best of 93 laid by Aminul Islam and Khaled Mashud against India in the inaugural Test in Dhaka in 2000. The left-handed batsman was four short of a deserved maiden hundred as he inside-edged paceman Dhamika Prasad, who returned three for 105. Shakib, adjudged the man of the match for his allround performance, made 96 off 211 balls that included seven fours. His departure triggered a lower-order collapse as Bangladesh lost their last four batsmen for just 10 runs. Dhamika again struck to have new batsman Mashrafee Bin Mortaz caught by keeper Prasanna Jayawardene for a six-ball two to peg Bangladesh back. Mushfiqur smacked 61 studded with seven fours before he became the fourth victim of spin wizard Muttiah Muralitharan, who returned four for 141 to raise his match tally to 10 for 190, his 22nd 10-wicket haul in a match. The Bangladesh wicketkeeper kept Mahbubul Alam off the strike in a bid to keep the runs flowing and was caught at midwicket by Dilshan while playing a forceful shot off a Muralitharan delivery. Alam was the last man out for two as he slipped down back to the keeping end while trying to run three and wicketkeeper Prasanna broke the stumps collecting a through from Dhilan. bdnew
