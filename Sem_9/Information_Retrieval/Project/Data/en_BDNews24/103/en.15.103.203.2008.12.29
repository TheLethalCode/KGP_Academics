 Dhaka, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com)  Thousands of voters were in the queue even after the voting closed at 4pm on Monday in the many polling centres in Dhaka. Many others complained they had returned home failing to cast votes. Hundreds of voters were lining up after 4pm at Sepahibagh Ongkur Kindergarten School, a polling centre of Dhaka-9 constituency. "The total number of voters of the centre is 3,250. Up to 2,000 votes have been cast until 4pm. Hundreds of voters are waiting outside the polling centre," presiding officer Mahbub Alam said. He, however, said people who had come before 4pm would be able to cast their ballots. Assistant presiding officer Shahin Akhter, who was in charge of number 5 booth of the centre, said the centre had 652 registered voters but only 350 votes were cast until 3:40pm. The turnout was low in the morning but increased in the later hours. It will take two to three more hours for the waiting voters to cast votes, she added. Muradpur Madrasa and Kalimullah Bagh Government Primary School also saw huge number of voters waiting outside the centres. At Moddhyo Badda Mistaul Ulum Madrasa, a polling centre of Dhaka-10 seat, many people could not enter the centres in the afternoon due to huge rush. The gate was closed after 4pm after the waiting voters were allowed in. The Awami League-led grand alliance candidate from this constituency, AKM Rahmatullah, alleged that some 1,500 voters were not allowed to enter the centre after 4 pm. Presiding officer Muniruzzaman said: "We will take votes until 4 pm. People who will be in the line will be allowed inside the centre." Assistant presiding officer Abul Kalam Azad said the centre had not had adequate space. bdnews24
