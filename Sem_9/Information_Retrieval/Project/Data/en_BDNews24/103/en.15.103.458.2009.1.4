<TEXT>
 By Arshad Mahmud, in Washington WASHINGTON, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com)  On New Year's Day, nine American Muslims were forcibly offloaded from a domestic flight from Washington to Orlando reportedly for suspicious behaviour, in an incident that underlines the uncomfortable situation the Muslims still live in the United States. Nearly eight years after a group of Islamic militants attacked the twin towers and the Pentagon, Muslims in America continue to face harassment on flimsy ground, even if they're U.S. born citizens, many Muslims and rights groups allege. It turned out that the nine passengersfive of them women and children belonging to two familieswere simply talking among themselves about the safest seats in the airplane where they wanted to sit. Some passengers who overheard the conversation apparently got suspicious and reported their conversation to a flight attendant, who in turn reported the matter to the pilot, who then called two air marshals, who removed them from the plane. The Muslim passengers were then interrogated by the FBI at the Regan National airport in Washington DC The plane left for Orlando about an hour later after all the bags were reexamined but the nine passengers were not allowed in even after the FBI cleared them. They later flew to Orlando on a separate airline. On Friday, AirTran, the domestic airline, apologised to the Muslim passengers and offered them a refund and to fly them back to Washington free of cost. But the male members of the group, Kashif Irfan, 34, a doctor and his 29-year-old brother Atiq, a lawyerboth from Virginia, said they were happy to receive an apology but was not sure whether they would accept the refund and offer of free return flight. Both brothers said they believed that their families and a friend were profiled at least in part because of their appearance. All but one of their group are native-born U.S. citizens, and the ninth is a legal permanent U.S. resident, they said; six are of Pakistani descent, two are of Turkish descent, and one is African-American. All five adults and a teenager appeared traditionally Muslim, with the men wearing beards and the women in head scarves, they said. They were on their way to a religious retreat in Orlando. The brothers also said they were contemplating legal action and reported the matter to Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim advocacy group based in Washington "It is incumbent on any airline to ensure that members of the traveling public are not singled out or mistreated based on their perceived race, religion or national origin. We believe this disturbing incident would never have occurred had the Muslim passengers removed from the plane not been perceived by other travelers and airline personnel as members of the Islamic faith," CAIR said in its complaint filed with the U.S. Department of Transportation. Profiling by security agencies based on race, religion or ethnicity has concerned civil rights groups since at least 2001, when airport security escalated in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks. CAIR, for example, publishes a brochure advising Muslim passengers about how to protect their rights during air travel, including how to request respectful searches and how to avoid confrontations with airport security personnel. In 2008, the Transportation Department said it handled 87 complaints alleging discrimination by airlines based on race, ethnicity, national origin or color, but only four were security related, Bill Adams, a spokesman for the Department told the Washington Post. b
