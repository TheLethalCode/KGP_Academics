 Dhaka, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com)  BNP appeared to have conceded defeat on Thursday night in this week's election, relieving fears that it might call supporters into the streets after its earlier rejection of the results. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said, "Let [Awami League] form government. Let them run the country since they have had an opportunity." Asked if they would cooperate with the new government, Delwar said, "We want to see how the Awami League fulfils the promises it made to the people. "First, we will watch things closely. After evaluation of their work, we will make our move collectively." He made the remarks after laying wreaths at the grave of BNP founder late president Ziaur Rahman marking the 30th founding anniversary of the Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, the party's student front. He, however, said BNP had been undone by conspiracies at home and abroad, and claimed people now know how the elections were 'rigged'. "People now understand how the rigged election took place and how the votes were forged. The conspiracy has now become clear," he said. BNP office secretary Rizvi Ahmed said at a media briefing at the party's Gulshan office Awami League 'digitally rigged' ballot. The allegation has reference to the promise its bitter rival made in the election manifesto of ushering in the digital era in Bangladesh. "It's unbelievable that nearly 90 percent votes were cast in Monday's polls, and that means a voter needed only 55 seconds to cast ballot." Prime minister-elect Sheikh Hasina, who heads the victorious Awami League-led coalition, on Wednesday offered to share power with BNP chief Khaleda Zia in an attempt to persuade her to accept the results of the poll. She had offered senior parliamentary and ministerial posts to BNP when a new government is formed next week. President Iajuddin Ahmed, earlier in the day, said the national election was free and transparent. Later, at a crowded news conference, chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda, in a veiled reference to BNP and its allies, called for accepting the people's mandate. Foreign election observers said the vote was free, fair and credible. bdnews24.co
