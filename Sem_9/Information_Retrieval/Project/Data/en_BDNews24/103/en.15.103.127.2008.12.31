 Dhaka, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League and grand alliance chief Sheikh Hasina was set to give her first public statement since her landslide win in Monday's parliamentary polls in a televised press conference on Wednesday morning. An earlier press conference scheduled for 4pm on Tuesday, was deferred to Wednesday, her press secretary Abul Kalam Azad said. "Owing to unavoidable circumstances the press conference has been re-scheduled for tomorrow," Azad told reporters at 4:45 pm on Tuesday. Hasina was set to address the post-election conference at the National Press Club hours after winning a historic victory in Monday's general election. Local and foreign news media crew gathered at the venue by 2:30pm as per the earlier announcement by AL. The VIP lounge of the press club was found too small for the number of journalists and guests who poured in. At one stage, the organisers decided to shift the programme to the auditorium. Journalists rushed to the new venue where her personal security officials had to struggle to maintain the security cordon. Then came the new announcement that the schedule has been changed for unavoidable reason to Wednesday afternoon after a discussion among Hasina's press secretary Azad, AL election coordination committee co-chairman HT Imam and her personal security officials. As per the latest results of Monday's national election announced by the Election Commission, the grand alliance rode to an absolute majority of 262 seats out of 299 called. Awami League as a single party bagged 230 and its main rival BNP-led alliance managed ran a poor second with 32 seats. Neither AL nor the alliance reacted officially to the results to date. bdnew
