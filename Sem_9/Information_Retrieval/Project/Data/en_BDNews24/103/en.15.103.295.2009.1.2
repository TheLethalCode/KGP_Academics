 LONDON, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Steven Gerrard will play for Liverpool in Saturday's FA Cup third-round game at Preston North End, manager Rafa Benitez said on Friday. Gerrard spent a night in police cells last week and was charged with assault following an incident in a nightclub. Benitez, who has often rested some of his big names for domestic cup matches, said the England midfielder would feature in the game for the Premier League leaders against the Championship (second division) side. "He was okay, he was training normally. I was talking to him and the lawyers and supported him 100 percent," Benitez told Sky Sports News. "The best thing for us is that to focus on football, he's training really well and he will play tomorrow. That means for me he is ready. "He's a very, very good professional and will be thinking about football and hopefully everybody will be talking only about the game." Looking ahead to the match, Benitez said: "We will pick a strong team. We want to keep up the momentum and we want to win.
