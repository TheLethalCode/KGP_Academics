 Dhaka, Jan 4 (bdnews24.com) - Prime minister-elect Sheikh Hasina has been cleared of charges in an extortion case brought against her by businessman Tazul Islam Faruq, as police on Sunday signed off on the final report in the case. "We submitted the report to Dhaka Metropolitan Judge's Court in the afternoon," investigation officer of the case and the Tejgaon Police Station's officer-in-charge Lutfar Rahman told bdnews24.com. Faruq had filed the Tk 3 crore extortion case against Hasina with Tejgaon police on Apr 9, 2008. Just last month, on Dec. 23 just days before the general election, he appealed to the same police station to withdraw the case against her. In his application to withdraw the case, Tazul mentioned, "The case was filed following misunderstanding under certain circumstances prevailing at the time the case was filed." "The filing of the case was an unexpected situation for me. Through my own will and courage, I am withdrawing the case. As a responsible businessman and conscious citizen, I don't want to blend business with politics," Tazul had said in his written application. Tazul, chairman of Westmont Power Ltd. had filed a case accusing the former prime minister and her then personal assistant of extorting Tk 3 crore through abuse of power and influence during Awami League's Hasina-led rule from 1996-2001. Businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury, managing director of the East Coast Trading Limited and chairman of Prime Bank, also applied to the home adviser on Dec. 14 to withdraw a similar case against Hasina through an executive order. bdnews24.c
