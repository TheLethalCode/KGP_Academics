 Chittagong, Dec 29 (bdnew24.com)  Voting has been peaceful for four seats in Kotwali, Dobolmuring, Patenga, Chandgaon-Boalkhali, Sitakunda and Mirshorai, informs bdnews24.com reporter Faruk Iqbal. During this time no events of aggression were reported from the voting areas. Though the rumour that 2/3 candidates have been arrested could not be substantiated. In all the centres, men and women lined in a disciplined way to vote and there were no signs of any agitation. But the presence of women voters was noteworthy. The law enforcers were active and the army and RAB were in constant patrol. "Due to the praiseworthy action taken by the administration, we are able to vote in a peaceful situation," said Ahmad Hossain Sawdagar, a voter in Sitakunda. A huge number of people congregated near Ghoramara Primary School at ten in the morning and looked to go out of control but the police chased the people and dispersed harmful elements. "So far, I have visited different polling centres but have not received any complaint," said A K M Shahidul Huq, Deputy Inspector General of police. "This time, the voters have an added feeling of security." The total number of voters is 3879 and till 11am, 1500 votes were cast, said Satyadarshi Barua, presiding officer of Barakamaldah Primary School centre. "So far, we have not received any news of problem and, if there is any information of a crowd converging, we are sending RAB and police," said official of the Mirshorai thana. In Baddarhat Ekhlasur Rahman Primary School centre, thousands of women voters were standing in line but the presiding officer Giasuddin said that due to lack of space and a narrow entrance, there is delay in taking votes. "But, the votes of those waiting will be taken even if it has to be at night." bdnew
