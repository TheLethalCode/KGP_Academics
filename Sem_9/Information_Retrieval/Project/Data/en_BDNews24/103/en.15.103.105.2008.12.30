 JAMRUD, Pakistan, Tue Dec 30, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan suspended supplies going to foreign forces in Afghanistan on Tuesday as security forces launched an operation against militants in the Khyber Pass region, a government official said. Militants have launched a string of attacks in recent months aimed at choking off supplies trucked to foreign forces in landlocked Afghanistan through northwest Pakistan from the port city of Karachi. Khyber's top administrator, Tariq Hayat, told reporters that a curfew had been imposed and the main road leading to the Afghan border had been sealed. "Supplies to NATO forces will remain suspended until we clear the area of militants and outlaws who have gone out of control," he said. Hayat said security forces, backed by helicopter gunships and artillery and tanks, began an offensive early on Tuesday
