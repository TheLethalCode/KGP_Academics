 Dhaka, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com)  Chief election commissioner said he hoped for 70-75 percent voter turnout for the ninth parliamentary polls, as he accompanied his wife to vote on Monday. "I can feel a festive mood in the voters crowding in the city's polling centres and the tens of thousands heading for home constituencies braving the cold," the CEC said. "In view of the peaceful voting nationwide, I can expect 70-75 percent votes will be cast by the end of the day," he said at Gulshan Model High School as he cast his ballot just after 10am. "Turnout of 70-75 percent is an internationally recognised standard," he added. "I can feel a festive mood in the voters crowding in the city's polling centres and the tens of thousands heading for home constituencies braving the cold," the CEC said. He requested voters to choose the right candidates. In reply to a pertinent question, Huda said, "All parties will accept the poll results as voting is being held in a transparent process." When queried, the CEC said the presiding officer who was caught in Tangail the night before the election, stamping seals on the ballot papers ahead of voting, had been sent into police custody and a new official was posted to conduct polls there. After casting his vote, the chief election commissioner made a brief stop at his Election Commission office, and then went on to inspect different polling centres in the city. bdnews24.com correspondent Moinul Hoque Chowdhury accompanying the CEC says Huda has been trying to encourage "the young, new and the first-time voters". Early reports from constituencies across the country say the polling has generally been peaceful, but there has been some turmoil in some cases resulting from newly-introduced photo identity cards for voters. In Dhaka, some young voters carrying ID cards complained that their names were not found on the voters' list. Our correspondent says the CEC has ordered an immediate investigation into the matter. This is Bangladesh's 9th parliamentary election since independence after two years of emergency rule, and the first countrywide vote in seven years. bdnews24.com/mhc/mt/rah/1312hours bd
