 Dhaka, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com) - The general elections on Dec. 29 were held transparently and fairly, said president Iajuddin Ahmed on Thursday, two days after BNP chief Khaleda Zia alleged 'unprecedented' vote fraud. Iajuddin opened his speech at the launch of the 14th Dhaka International Trade Fair at Bangladesh China Friendship Conference Centre by felicitating people over a free and fair ballot and congratulating the electoral victors. He expressed his gratitude to the Almighty as everything went well with the voting. Khaleda on Tuesday night said at a press conference that the voting was stage-managed to defeat the BNP-led four-party alliance. Awami League and its allies won a historic landslide in the most fair balloting the country has ever known. American, European and Commonwealth observers. alongside local election monitors have said the elections were credible, free, fair and transparent. Iajuddin, who assumed the largely ceremonial presidency during Khaleda's 2001-2006 rule, said the newly-elected parties will soon assume the authority for running the government. "Amid the prevalent global economic depression, Bangladesh is carrying out its trade and commerce cautiously. The government formed a better business forum (BBF) in 2007 to identify and address its economic hurdles," said Iajuddin. "I hope the BBF will play its necessary role in maintaining the national economy. The new government should also face the challenges of globalisation experienced by the developing world and bolster own position." "I'm sanguine about Bangladesh's trade and commerce problems and its gradually increasing involvement with the World Trade Organisation and other pertinent institutions." Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman, commerce secretary Feroze Ahmed, Sri Lankan high commissioner Dhikkrishna Moorty and Export Promotion Bureau vice chairman Shahab Ullah also spoke on the occasion. EPB has organised the fair scheduled to be on for a month. bdnews24.com
