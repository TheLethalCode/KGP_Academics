<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com) Adviser M Anwarul Iqbal said on Tuesday power would be handed over to an elected government in 7-10 days after the results were gazetted and oaths taken. "The new government will be formed after the members-elect take oath as MPs, then the caretaker government will hand over charge to the incumbent new administration," Iqbal said. The adviser said, "A gazette is published in three to seven days after the results are announced. Therefore there is no scope to go beyond 7-10 days." In a historic landslide victory Awami League-led grand alliance won as many as 260 seats in Monday's election, giving them more than absolute majority in the parliament. Asked for his reaction about the fairness of the election and the results, the local government adviser said, "A fair and neutral election took place and the people voted for their choices. This is a good sign." bdnew
