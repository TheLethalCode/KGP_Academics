<TITLE> Transition: from emergency to democracy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh's two-year journey ends Monday with the ninth parliamentary polls taking place in the hope of a smooth transition from emergency to democracy. The head of the outgoing interim administration Fakhruddin Ahmed called on the nation to cast its vote on Monday to bring an elected government to power for the next five years, saying his two-year caretaker government was on the threshold of fulfilling its commitment. "We're now at the end of meeting our promises," the CA said in a televised speech on the eve of election with the country standing hours away from electing it next leaders, after a long and bumpy ride. BNP chief and two-time former prime minister Khaleda Zia stepped down on Oct. 28, 2006 at the end of her five-year term leading a four-party coalition government. Iajuddin Ahmed was sworn in next day as head of a caretaker government entrusted to hold polls. But violence broke out countrywide amid allegations by the opposition Awami League that BNP had stacked the Election Commission with partisans and stuffed the voter rolls with 1.4 crore fake names. Things also took a serious turn as the AL-led 14-party alliance declared a boycott of the general election scheduled for Jan. 22, 2007 over a controversy involving the head of caretaker government. The election was postponed and President Iajuddin was forced to declare a state of emergency on Jan. 11, imposing curfew and curtailing certain civil rights. He then resigned as the head of the caretaker government, though he remained chief of state. On Jan. 12, 2007, Fakhruddin Ahmed was sworn-in as chief adviser of a new army-installed caretaker government, which passed an emergency rule ordinance the following day and coming into force on Jan. 26, curbing political rights. The new caretaker government took a number of reform initiatives during its unprecedented two-year tenure and launched a far-reaching antigraft drive. Two former prime ministers Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina and a raft of top political figures were sent to jail on corruption charges. Both the former prime ministers were released earlier this year, though cases against them are still pending. With the country alternating between fears of a total army takeover and hopes of election, the chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda announced an "electoral roadmap" on Jul. 15, 2007. The Election Commission and the government entered into several rounds of 'dialogue' with political parties to reach consensus on electoral reforms and a smooth transition to democracy. The emergency was lifted in phases with the ban on indoor politics removed on May 13 this year. The government also eased the emergency at places for city corporation and municipality elections in August 2008. After two changes in the election schedules since a first announcement on Nov. 2, the EC finally finalised the polls schedules on Nov. 23, fixing the parliamentary election for Dec. 29. Fakhruddin Ahmed finally lifted the two-year state of emergency on Dec. 17, with little disruption, making way for what most parties and observers believe will be the freest, fairest and most credible election in Bangladesh's history. bdnews2
