 Cox's Bazar, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com)  Newly-elected MP from Cox's Bazar-1 Hasina Ahmed was injured in a car crash on Wednesday morning that left her driver dead on the spot, her personal aide said. Two of her assistants were also critically injured. The four-party alliance leader's media secretary Ikram Chowdhury said she was heading for Dhaka from her in-law's house in Pekua in her jeep. On the way the driver lost control at Jaillatala near Aziz Nagar around 10am and the vehicle skidded into a roadside ditch. Driver Abdur Rahman, 45, died on the spot and the condition of her two injured private assistants Henaul Islam Babul, 40, and Mohammad Sofwanul Karim, 30, is critical, Chowdhury said. The injured have been rushed to Chakoria Zamzam Hospital where resident medical officer Dr Munir Ahmed said Hasina had her legs and hands injured. X-Ray was done. "But the injuries are not very severe," Dr Munir said. Chowdhury said Hasina might be shifted to Chittagong or Dhaka for better treatment. She won the Cox's Bazar-1 (Chakoria-Pekua) seat in Monday's parliamentary election as a four-party candidate. She is wife of jailed former state minister Salah Uddin Ahmed. bdn
