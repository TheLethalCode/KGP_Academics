 Biswadip Das Dhaka, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com)  Voters lifted Awami League, and its allies, to unprecedented gains on a groundswell of revulsion over patronage, corruption, war crimes and militancy in Monday's election, believed to the fairest ever held in the country. The peaceful polling, with record turnout, gave Sheikh Hasina and her alliance members a stunning haul of 262 of 299 seats, a big enough majority in parliament to overcome procedural hurdles, pass legislation, and even tweak the country's constitution. Observers are waiting to see how the party, which campaigned with the mantra of 'Change' to cut across social classes, will go about its business of governing the country that has runaway prices weighing on people. Most analysts say the Hasina administration should attach priority to economy in the wake of the global recession. Price hikes that began with the past BNP-led government from 2001-2006 alongside Hasina's election speeches against graftthe reputation of former prime minister Khaleda Zia's sons and cabinet colleagues for using political perches to benefit themselves and their friendswere major reasons for the four-party's downfall this time. That women and religious minorities could cast their ballots without fear may also have been reason for the catastrophic losses suffered by BNP's ally Jamaat-e-Islami in particular, the party gaining only two seats in the next parliament. Anti-war criminal sentiment that built up over the past two years also played havoc on the four-party alliance's polls prospects. "Relentless campaigning against war criminals is the reason for the downfall of Jamaat," says Dhaka University history professor Syed Anwar Hossain. Both BNP and Jamaat leaders have also been accused of aiding and abetting the Islamist militants who carried out attacks on Hasina and British envoy Anwar Choudhury, in a bid to shut their rivals out. Their deeds over those five years probably prompted first-time voters, all post-independence generation, to reject hardline politics. New voters, estimated at 30 percent of some 8 crore enrolled, were also drawn to young and new faces among AL candidates. "People suffered during the four-party government and the issues of price hike, militancy and lack of good governance resulted in their losses," Hossain told bdnews24.com. "People used the first tenure of the AL regime as a comparison yardstick, and the first four years of the first Awami League tenure were marked by success stories," he said. "BNP's organisational weakness, image crisis due to the anticorruption crackdown contributed to its failure in securing a solid ground," Hossain observed. "Bangladesh is a tilting nation, this time it has tilted towards AL." "Hopefully, they will establish a cautious, controlled and future oriented government." BNP's delayed decision on participation in the ballot sent wrong signals to various parties inclduing its own supporters. Its slogan, 'save the country, save the people' did not have much of an impact on the voters. The stale, over-used anti-India, sovereignty cards, the invoking of Islam by the four-party alliance also fell flat on the face. In contrast, AL focused on BNP's five-years of "misrule and corruption". BNP harped on caretaker government's two years more than anything else, maybe to try to wash off incumbency, but it did not work Khaleda worked much harder tahn Hasina, but was ill-prepared, ill-briefed on campaign strategy, and said the same thing over and over again. BNP's nominees included more opprtunist, rich people than die-hard party faithfuls, whereas AL chose more from the grassroots. The hype about the Comilla grenade haul near Khaleda's campaign rally to match the threat to life of Hasina from Harkatul Jihad-al-Islami Bangladesh also lacked credibility. Khaleda rushed a meeting of the party's policymakers on Tuesday evening and emerged after midnight to say the outcome of the voting had been made up to defeat her electoral bloc. She stopped short of rejecting the ballot but said they would make a decision on the issue over the next few days, stoking concern that the BNP and its allies might contest the loss by calling mobs into the streets. There was concern that the BNP and its allies, which governed for five turbulent years until they stepped aside in October 2006 for a caretaker government, might contest the loss by calling mobs into the streets. They had cried foul play as the voting closed, alleging irregularities and slow voting. News reports on the night before the vote said many of their supporters were arrested on charges of trying to buy votes with sacks of money. After all, since 1991, when they and their supporters restored democracy after nine years of military rule. Both Khaleda and Hasina have fought bitterly for control of the government and together they have given the country a singular reputation for political violence. But few of Khaleda's followers seemed to believe that the Election Commission, praised by international observers for its impartiality, would overturn the results on the basis of their spotty allegations of abuses. The victory of the AL, and its allies, including former president HM Ershad's Jatiya Party, which polled 27 seats, appears increasingly likely to be accepted without a recurrence of the turmoil and violence that have often marred past elections in Bangladesh. bd
