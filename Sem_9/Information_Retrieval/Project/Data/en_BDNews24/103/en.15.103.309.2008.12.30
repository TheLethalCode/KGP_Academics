 Dhaka, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com) - After a catastrophic defeat in the national election, an 'emotional' BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia chaired a meeting of the party's highest policymaking body, the National Standing Committee, on Tuesday evening, a party insider said. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, committee members Khandker Mosharraf Hossain, RA Ghani, Chowdhury Tanvir Ahmed Siddiqui, Khandker Mahbub Uddin Ahmad and M Shamsul Islam were attending the meeting at the chairperson's Gulshan office. Prior to the meeting of the 11-strong committee, Khaleda appeared emotional as she waved at a few hundred supporters from the second floor of the office around 6:45pm, witnesses said. She stood there in silence for sometime as party supporters shouted slogans. The meeting was the first organisational move after the party's defeat in Monday's general elections. bdnews24.c
