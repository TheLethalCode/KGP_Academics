 Chittagong, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com)  A BTV journalist on Wednesday urged the vice chancellor of the University of Chittagong to try and punish teachers and staffers who assaulted him on Dec. 28. Sajjad Hossain, Chittagong correspondent of state-run Bangladesh Television, filed a written complaint with VC Prof. Badiul Alam. Earlier on Sunday, a driver, who was driving a shuttle bus of the university teachers, behaved rudely with the journalist while he was carrying out his professional duty at the square adjacent to MA Aziz Stadium. A teacher sitting behind the bus driver was also about to attack Hossain with a brick when he protested the driver's rudeness. Instantly, he was dragged into the bus by the teachers and helpers and beaten up. They even broke his video camera, he alleged. The Chittagong Union of Journalists on Wednesday denounced the assault on Hossain and demanded punishment to the perpetrators. Hossain also filed a general diary with Kotwali Police Station on that day. bdnews24
