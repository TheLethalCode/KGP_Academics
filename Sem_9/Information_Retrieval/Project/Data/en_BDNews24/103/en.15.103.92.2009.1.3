 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Jan 03 (bndews24.com)Muhammad Jamiruddin Sircar, the outgoing Speaker who failed to retain his seat as a BNP nominee, says he fears what he calls a "parliamentary autocracy" as the incoming treasury bench will have a massive majority in the House. In an interview with bdnews24.com Saturday after administering oath to the newly-elected MPs of the AL-led grand alliance, the Speaker said he, however, believed the 31-strong BNP-Jaamat combine would be able to challenge the Awami League and allies in parliament unless they were obstructed. "They should be able to give a good fight," Sircar told bdnews24.com at his office at Jatiya Sangsad building.

I will be in legal profession as I am a barrister. "I will not run in the election again. I will also discourage my barrister son." Sircar was however optimistic about BNP prospects and said he would back BNP if it called strikes in protest at "oppression". "This (calling general strikes) is their the constitutional right," he said. "But they must not damage cars and business establishments, resort to arson, or attack and kill people and get engaged in other unconstitutional actions," he said. "If the opposition calls strikes and hartals, people (should be allowed to) judge their actions and take decisions in democratic ways," Sircar said. "As a politician, I am really frustrated. Black money now controls politics," he said. Sircar, who fought to retain Panchagarh-1 seat on a BNP ticket, claimed he tried to maintain his impartiality as guardian of the House. "Democracy will suffer in future unless good sense prevails upon them (Awami League)," said Sircar, who has often courted controversy with his anti-Awami League tirade while still being in office. He said the Awami League should "give the microscopic opposition the chance to play their role in parliament
