 Dhaka, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, a key component of the BNP-led bloc, saw its stock plummet in Monday's polls. Facing many hostilities in the run-up to the vote and playing its religion card more mutedly than before, the party polled only two seatsa good 15 fewer than it had in the last election where it netted 17 seats. Jamaat, which rebranded itself to be registered with the Election Commission, won the Chittagong-14 (Satkania) seat with Shajahan Chowdhury. A party 'renegade', Hamidur Rahman Azad, won Cox's Bazar-2. The reversal of their political fortunes was so stunning that its chief former minister Motiur Rahman Nizami, secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammed Mujahid, and firebrand Delwar Hossain Sayeedee lost by massive margins. Jamaat contested in 39 parliamentary seats. Nizami ran for Pabna -1, Mojaheed for Faridpur-3, Mohammed Kamruzzaman for Sherpur-3, A T M Ajharul Islam for Rangpur-2, Abdus Sobhan for Pabna-5, Sayeedee for Pirojpur-1, Syed Abdullah Md Taher for Comilla-11 and Hamidur Rahman Azad vied for Cox's Bazar-2 among the seats. bdnew
