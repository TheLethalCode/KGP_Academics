 Al-Amin Dewan, CU Correspondent Chittagong, Jan 1 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong University students have been vacating the residential halls since Dec. 30 in fear of violent conflicts between Awami League's student wing Chhatra League and a few other student organisations. Since the day after the general election on Dec. 29, which the AL-led grand alliance won, the residential students of six halls of the university have left with their belongings. They took temporary shelters in bachelors' quarters or relatives' houses in the city. Vice chancellor Prof Badiul Alam held an emergency meeting with the proctor and provosts on Wednesday in the wake of the students leaving halls. The meeting decided to monitor the halls regularly to help genuine residents get back to halls and also suggested steps to maintain peace on the campus. On a visit to the halls on Thursday bdnews24.com hardly found any students in the halls except the members of Islami Chhatra Shibir, the Jamaa-e-Islami-backed student organisation. Mustafizur Rahman and Saiful Islam of Shahjalal Hall, Abdur Rashid of Shah Amanat Hall, Rezwan Ahmed of AF Rahman Hall, Abdul Latif and Iftekhar Hossain of Shaeed Suhrawardy Hall left the dormitories on Wednesday. They told bdnews24.com they apprehended a violent conflict after pro-BCL students, who had been driven out of the halls by four-party alliance adherents before, get back to their halls. Asked about the students leaving the halls en masse, CU proctor Prof Mohammad Jasim Uddin told bdnews24.com the authorities were doing all they could to maintain calm. Provost of Shaheed Abdur Hall told bdnews24.com the Wednesday's meeting chaired by the VC asked the authorities to visit the halls to keep an eye on the situation and maintain order. On Thursday, BCL brought out a procession along the university thoroughfares for the first time after seven years. BCL's CU unit vice president Mohammad Anisuzzaman Emon told bdnews24.com, "Not through conflict, but through legitimate means we want to board the halls." Meanwhile, Islami Chhatra Shibir has announced it will resist the members of BCL and other organisations getting into the halls. Its organising secretary Zakir Hossain told bdnews24.com, "Shibir's control on the halls was always there and will always remain." He warned the BCL and other student organisations that "any attempt to create problems on the campus would be strongly dealt with". He said the results of the national election have no bearing on who controls the residential halls. Shibir has been dominating the six halls and more than 50 nearby cottages for long. bdnews24
