 KABUL, Mon Dec 29, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide bomber detonated a car bomb outside a government office north of the Afghan capital Kabul on Monday, wounding at least 12 people, sources said. The attack happened as Afghan provincial authorities and US forces were holding a weekly meeting inside the office of the governor of Parwan province in the local capital Charikar, one source who is a politician from the province told Reuters. US forces had blocked off the area in Charikar, 60 km north of Kabul, she said. A US military vehicle had been hit by the blast and was on fire, she added, but had no further details. Two other sources from Charikar said at least 12 Afghans were wounded in the attack, part of a spate of rising violence this year in Afghanistan
