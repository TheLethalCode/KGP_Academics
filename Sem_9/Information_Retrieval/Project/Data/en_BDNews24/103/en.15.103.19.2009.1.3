 Dhaka, Jan 3 (bdnews24.com)  Prime Minister-elect Sheikh Hasina and 258 others Saturday took oath as MPs in a brief ceremony watched by millions of people in Bangladesh and abroad. The state-run BTV broadcast the ceremony, officiated by outgoing Speaker M Jamiruddin Sircar. The newly-elected Awami League MPswith all the men attired in traditional Mujib coatswaited patiently for the arrival of the Speaker. Hasina, flanked by SSF officers, was the last to arrive among the new MPs and joined the first batch of 180 MPs for the swearing-in. A smiling Speaker, known and criticised for his past anti-AL diatribes, greeted the new MPs, congratulated them and wished success to the 9th parliament. Sircar, who lost his Panchagarh-1 constituency to a relatively unknown AL nominee, will not have a seat in the new parliament, which will in all probability go into its first session later this month and whose first sitting will be chaired by the former BNP minister. The AL won 230 seatsincluding Hasina's threemaking 228 AL MPs. The 180-capacity oath room necessitated a second session for the AL MPs and others. Barring Ranjit Kumer Roy of Jessore-4, who failed to reach Dhaka, all other AL MPs took oath. All JP MPs--reduced to 25 because of Gen Ershad's winning three seats--were sworn in. Three JSD MPs, two Workers Party MPs and two independents also completed the formality. A third session brought together MPs from the Jaitya Party, including H M Ershad. Another round of oath-taking is scheduled for Sunday afternoon when opposition MPs led by Khaleda Zia will sign up. Khaleda has already notified she will retain her Feni-1 seat, giving upBogra 6 and 7. bdnews24
