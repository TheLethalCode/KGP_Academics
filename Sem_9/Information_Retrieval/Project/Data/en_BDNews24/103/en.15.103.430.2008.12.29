<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former England midfielder Peter Reid insists he has long-term plans to remain as coach of the Thai national team, despite missing out on silverware in his first tournament. Reid watched Thailand dominate both legs of the Southeast Asian championship final against Vietnam before a stoppage time goal in Hanoi on Sunday earned his opponents a 3-2 aggregate victory. He said the defeat was a blow but stressed his plans for the soccer-mad Kingdom were long term. "Losing was a setback but I've no intention to go anywhere just yet," Reid told Reuters. "The players have been brilliant, the people are great, everything's going well." Reid signed a lucrative four-year contract in September to steer the success-starved side to their first World Cup finals in 2014. His next focus will be reaching the 2011 Asian Cup, for which qualifiers start next month. The Thais contest a tricky group with Jordan, regional powerhouse Iran and archrivals Singapore. "I think this side has a lot of potential and we have to build on what we've done," added the former Manchester City boss, who recently ruled out a return to another of his former Premier League clubs, Sunderland. "There's plenty of work to do and improvements to be made but they're all young lads and they're a committed bunch. I'm delighted with the way they've conducted themselves.
