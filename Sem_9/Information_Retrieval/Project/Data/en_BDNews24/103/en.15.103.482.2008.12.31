 Sydney, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters Life!) - Can't relax at the beach, the pub and the gym? Stressed Sydneysiders are being encouraged to face the music as a New Year wind-down involving pianos placed for use by any would-be passing maestros. As part of the 2009 Sydney Festival, 30 pianos will be placed at several public places, including aboard a busy harbor ferry, a train station and even a tattoo parlor, to encourage people to take time out and interact with each other. The installation, dubbed "Play Me, I'm Yours," is the brainchild of British artist Luke Jerram, who previously held similar projects in Britain and Brazil. "It's one way of animating a public space and allowing people the opportunity to stop and speak with one another as well as have the unusual experience of being able to freely sit down and play music," project manager Michelle Kotevski told Reuters. "I don't think there's ever been a piano put on a public ferry before for this sort of project, I think this is a first," Each piano will have a "buddy," or a local person who will look after it and encourage people to play. The Sydney Festival runs from January 10 through to 31 January and Kotevski said she expected the pianos to be a hit. "So far, the two other places this project happened was Birmingham and Sao Paulo and lots of people came out of the woodwork and played," she said.
