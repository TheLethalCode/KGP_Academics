<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com)  Several thousand voters in Chittagong-10 and five constituencies in Narayanganj did not find their names on the voter lists available in different centres on Monday. At the TCB building centre under Chittagong-10 (Bandartilla) seat, scores of voters failed to find their names on the list though they got registered there. Nearly 1500 voters including Jyotsna Akhter and Mohammad Abdul were not in the voting roll. Nasrin Akhter, another voter, told bdnews24.com that she got registered in the area and was supposed to vote here, but her name was not there in the list. Lipi Akhter said she rushed to many other centres as she did not find her name in that centre, but all went in vain. Several other centres in ward-39 of Bandartilla also had the same complicacy. Presiding officer of the centre Nazrul Islam admitted the problem and said efforts were being made to solve it. Meanwhile, our Narayanganj correspondent said voters in five constituencies there had faced the problem as their names were missing in the voter lists at the polling centres. Angry voters complained that the voter serial numbers mentioned in the voters' slips and the numbers they got from the polling officers on the basis of national IDs were confusing. They failed to cast their votes. Returning officer and Narayanganj deputy commissioner AMA Rahman confirmed the inconsistencies in the voter lists and the voter slips. The returning officer later went to Narayanganj Government Girls' High School centre to assure the aggrieved voters that they would be allowed to vote if they could tell the polling officers their residence address. "I visited the centres and assured the angry voters that they could cast votes on condition of disclosing their residence addresses," Rahman told reporters. "There would no more problems." Narayanganj Government Girls' High School centre has over 10,000 voters. bdnews24.com/aad/m
