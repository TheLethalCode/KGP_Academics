 Dhaka, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com)  The government has taken initiatives to establish a central 'Consumers Rights Protection Department' to enforce the consumers rights act, said adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman on Wednesday. A committee of district commissioners will be formed to spread the department's operations in the districts, the adviser told reporters after the first meeting of the National Consumer Rights Protection Committee. A six-member sub-committee, headed by Dr Zafarullah Chowdhury, former president of Consumers Association of Bangladesh (CAB), has been formed to finalise the rules and regulations of the department. "Everything will be finalised next week based on the committee's report. A not top-heavy department will be established. The department will work to create awareness among consumers and take steps against cheating businessmen." The adviser hoped the new government would push forward the consumer act. bdnews
