 Dhaka, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com)  The European Union's Election Observation Mission on Wednesday said Monday's general elections reflected the will of people, in a verdict contradicting BNP chief Khaleda Zia's allegations of manipulation in voting. "The outcome of the election appears to reflect the will of the people of Bangladesh. The EOM observers did not report patterns of fraud in the process," EOM head Alexander Graf Lambsdorff told reporters at a crowded press conference. While revealing its preliminary observation report at Sheraton hotel, the EOM head said his team did not get any proof of fraud in the voting process. Lambsdorff , the German opposition lawmaker, differed on Khaleda's contention on low voter turnout. "I don't believe the turnout was exaggerated." "Bangladeshi people turned out to vote in large numbers, and were able to do so in a peaceful environment. Minor technical difficulties aside, professionalism, transparency and credibility were the hallmark of this election". Khaleda on Tuesday night alleged that in many centres polling booths were blank by mid-day, but the voter turnout was shown higher. The EOM chief termed the new voter list "inclusive, accurate and reliable". "The Election Commission carried out its obligations in an impartial fashion and demonstrated its ability to conduct the technical preparations for elections." The EOM said the election campaign following the withdrawal of the state of emergency was "free and open". "The campaign was remarkably peaceful. However, there were some isolated incidents of violence between supporters of rival candidates," said Lambsdorff. He also said there was no restriction on media during the polls. "The media enjoyed a reasonable degree of freedom of expression with no reported instances of intimidation or violence against journalists," he said. He thanked the civil society for its role in the elections. "Civil society organisations played an important role in the process of carrying out a number of election activities, including election observation, civic education, political party development and initiatives to increase women's participation," said Lambsdorff. He said the EOM would release its full observation report in March after getting reports from the long-term observers who had been assessing the post-election conditions. bdnew
