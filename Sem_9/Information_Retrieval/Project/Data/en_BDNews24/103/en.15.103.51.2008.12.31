 Dhaka, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com) - The government has decided to bring the entire Chittagong Hill Tract region under cellphone coverage. "The government has taken the decision with an aim to improve the living standard of the hill people,," BTRC chairman Monjurul Alam told bdnews24.com on Wednesday. The government has decided to expand mobile phone networks in all three CHT districts - Khagracchari, Bandarban and Rangamati, says the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission "We hope, with the spread of the networks in the CHT districts, people here will see changes in their socio-economic life," he added. On May 15, the caretaker government okayed cell phone networks in municipality areas of the CHT districts. Following the decision, mobile phone companies have already set up their networks in municipal areas, but two upazilas in Rangamati districts - Barkal and Baghaichhari - will come under the coverage in the next phase. bdnews2
