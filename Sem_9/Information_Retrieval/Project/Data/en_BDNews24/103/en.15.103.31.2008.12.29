 LONDON, Dec 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England and Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard has been arrested on suspicion of assault, a police source said on Monday. Gerrard, 28, was one of six men arrested in the early hours of the morning after police were called to a disturbance at a bar in Southport, north-west England. Merseyside Police confirmed they had arrested a 28-year-old man from the Formby area of Liverpool on suspicion of assault and said he remained in police custody. The other five men arrested, also for assault, all came from Liverpool and were aged 33, 31, 29, 19 and 18. Police said a 34-year-old man from Southport, north of Liverpool, was taken to hospital with facial injuries. A Liverpool spokesman said the club would not comment on the matter. Gerrard scored twice in a man-of-the-match performance in Sunday's 5-1 Premier League victory at Newcastle United
