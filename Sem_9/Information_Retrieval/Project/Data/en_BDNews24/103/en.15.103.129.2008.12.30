 Dhaka, Dec 30 (bdnews24.com)  Skipper Mohammad Ashraful struck an unbeaten 70 at close of the fourth day on Tuesday to take the first Test against Sri Lanka to the fifth day at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Bangladesh were 254 for five at stumps, still needing another 267 runs to chase an improbable target of 521 on the fifth and final day. The game had a one-day break on Monday due to the national elections. A partnership of 74 for the sixth wicket between Ashraful and Shakib Al Hasan (34 not out) ensured Bangladesh put up a fight. The hosts have to break the West Indies' highest run-chase of 418 against Australia to win the match. They had posted their highest fourth innings total of 285 for five against Zimbabwe in Dhaka in 2005. However, the batsmen, coming out of their defensive shell, dared some encourage shots against world's top class bowling attack to raise hopes of building partnerships. Ashraful and Shakib showed nerve after the hosts were reduced to 180 for five in the face of some vicious spin bowling from Muttiah Muralitharan, who claimed six Bangladesh scalps in the first innings. A relaxed-looking Ashraful, coming in at number five, negotiated the champion spinner well. He milked Muralitharan for nine four in his 138-ball 11-four innings. Shakib looked a bit cautious against the same bowler and concentrated on singles to make 34 off 94 balls. Imrul Kayes and Tamim Iqbal gave a fine 40-run start for the opening stand before Tillakaratne Dilshan ran Kayes out with a direct throw from the midwicket for 13. Tamim played aggressively to make 47 off 53 balls before he was caught behind wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene trying to pull paceman Dhamika Prasad . The left-handed opener struck eight fours. Junaed, who looked a hesitant initially, contributed 52 runs for the third wicket with Roqibul Hasan before he misread an outside-the-off-stump delivery off Muralitharan to edge at first slip to Mahela Jayawardene. Junaed played a 74-ball 37 studded with one six and five fours. Muralitharan then removed Roqibul with a straight delivery for 24 before he had Mehrab Hossain Junior caught by substitute Chamara Kapugedera for 23 to raise his wicket tally to three for 85. Earlier, Sri Lanka had declared their second innings at 405 for six after quickly adding 144 runs for the loss of two wickets to their overnight score of 291 for four. Jayawardene and Dilshan put on 95 runs for the fifth wicket with an average of 5.81 per over in the morning before both batsmen returned to the dressing room in the space of two runs. Dilshan edged Shakib Al Hasan to wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim but not before a quick 52-ball 45 studded with one six and three fours. Jayawardene took his overnight score of 129 to 168 before being a victim of Mehrab Hossain Junior, who returned two for 37. Jayawardene struck 19 fours and one six in his 269-ball knock. Prasanna Jayawardene (3) and Chaminda Vaas (15) remained unbeaten when Sri Lanka declared their innings soon after drinks in the first session on the fourth day. bdne
