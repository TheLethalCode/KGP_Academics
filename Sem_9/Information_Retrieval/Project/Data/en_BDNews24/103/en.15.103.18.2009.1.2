 Chittagong, Jan 2 (bdnews24.com)  A fire breaking out in the 'dried fish zone' at Asadganj in the port city Thursday midnight gutted a dozen depots with huge quantities of dried fish, fire-fighters said. Fire serviceman Liton Barua told bdnews24.com the three-hour blaze burning down wares worth Tk 30 lakh started due to some power supply mishaps past midnight. A total of 16 fire extinguishing vehicles fought the roaring fire for three hours before dousing it, Barua said.
