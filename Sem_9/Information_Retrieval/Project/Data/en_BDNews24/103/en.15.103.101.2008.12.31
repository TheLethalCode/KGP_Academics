<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com)  Home adviser MA Matin has said he believes the first task of the new government will be to instill confidence in the law-enforcing agencies. It will have to start work from where the caretaker government would leave off, he told reporters on Wednesday ahead of the three-day Biswa Ijtema to be held at Tongi from Jan. 30. Matin said massive preparation had been taken to hold the Ijtema, the second biggest Muslim gathering after the haj. Last year guests from 72 countries participated in the annual ritual and this year guests may come from more countries, he added. 'On-arrival' visa for 45 days will be issued at the airport and for that purpose a special desk has been set up at the airport. As many as 10,000 security personnel will be deployedwhile CCTVs and helicopters will be there to control traffic on the day of 'Akheri Munajat'. A sub-committtee headed by the Dhaka divisional commissioner has been formed and a control room with nine sub-centres will be set up, the adviser added. For entry into the Ijtema ground, 10 pontoon bridges instead of seven will be set up on the Turag river. Additional steps will be taken for drainage, gas and drinking water supply, toilets, fire control and treatment. On the possibility of security threat, Matin said, "There is no such possibility. There is no law and order situation. Still, police will throw a security cordon round the venue of Ijtema. Besides, police and BDR will be there as will be round-the-clock surveillance by RAB, he added. Asked if he thought there were no threats from JMB militants, Matin said militants are being arrested. "We do not claim that the country is free of militants, but if RAB and other law-enforcing agencies remain active, the country will get free from militants." Matin did not believe the police would face problems after transfer of power to the elected government. "We have not intervened in their activity while we are in power. The police are working on its own. We could have done better work if we could have got cooperation from all." bdnews2
