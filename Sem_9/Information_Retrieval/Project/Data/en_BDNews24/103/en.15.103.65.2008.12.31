<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister-elect Sheikh Hasina has said the legitimacy of the incumbent interim government will be decided in parliament. "The decision about validating the activities of the present caretaker government will be taken through discussion in the parliament," Hasina said. She made the remarks to reporters on emerging from a meeting with chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed at his office in the afternoon. The issue has already been discussed with a number of legal experts, Hasina told reporters. "A committee will also be formed to work on the issue and even after that there is scope for discussion about it," Hasina said. She said a new government has to maintain the order of the outgoing government. Hasina's meeting with the interim government head was the first since the landslide victory of AL and its allies in Monday's general election. She reached the CA's office minutes before 4:00pm in a bullet-proof BMW car, and came out at around 5:30pm. Hasina entered the office, which is the Prime Minister's Office, after some seven and a half years. She left it after the end of her previous government's term in 2001. Asked about the agenda of her meeting with Fakhruddin, Hasina said it was a courtesy call. "[I] came to thank him for a fair election. We also discussed the overall situation of the country." Asked what the size of her cabinet would be, a smiling AL chief said, "If I disclose it right now, the suspense will be lost." "We all are young, what if [I'm over 60]," a good-humoured Hasina said when asked how many young lawmakers will be there in her cabinet. On the probable date of the swearing-in ceremony of the upcoming government, she pointed to Fakhruddin and said, "They will determine it." Fakhruddin said, "I hope the new government will take oath as quickly as possible. Preparations are on. A gazette [of the election results] needs to be published." "These issues also depend largely on the Election Commission," Fakhruddin said. Asked about the BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's allegation of staged-managed election results, he said, "This is an issue for the Election Commission to pick on, as it is the Commission which conducted the election." AL's election steering committee co-chairman HT Imam was present at the meeting, an official of the CA's office said. Hasina also met president Iajuddin Ahmed at Bangabhaban at 7:00pm. bdnews24.com/ehb/ma/si
