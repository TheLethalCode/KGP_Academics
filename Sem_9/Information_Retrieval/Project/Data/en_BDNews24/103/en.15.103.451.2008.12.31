<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 31 (bdnews24.com)Awami League president Sheikh Hasina, in her first public statement on Wednesday since her landslide win, urged all parties to work together for the betterment of Bangladesh stressing the role of the opposition in future governance. "We want to avoid destructive politics," said Hasina speaking to a packed hall at the Bangladesh-China Conference Centre. She said chairs of parliamentary standing committees would be picked to proportionally represent the opposition. When asked whether she would choose ministers from among opposition MPs, she replied that her previous cabinet included two opposition members. "Of course, I don't have a problem with that," said the head of the multi-party alliance that won a landslide in Monday's parliamentary poll. Hasina urged all political parties "to work together forgetting all divisions at this time" for the betterment of the people and the country. The opposition has a crucial role to play in governance, said the AL chief about to enter her second term as prime minister. "We will ensure the role and participation of the opposition in parliament and governance," she promised. Hasina, flanked by party leaders Zillur Rahman and HT Imam, was half hidden behind a raft of microphones as she gave a thoughtful and well-worded speech in a televised press conference. An earlier press conference scheduled for the previous afternoon at the National Press Club was deferred and shifted to the much larger hall at the capital's largest conference centre on Wednesday.
