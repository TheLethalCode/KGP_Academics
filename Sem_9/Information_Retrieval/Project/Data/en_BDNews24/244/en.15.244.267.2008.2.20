 MUMBAI, India, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The tycoons behind India's new Twenty20 cricket tournament gathered in a Mumbai hotel conference room on Wednesday ready to hammer their cheque-books to sign some of the biggest names in sport. The eight franchise teams of the Indian Premier League will bid for 78 players who go under the hammer at the five-star hotel. The closed-door auction could last up to 12 hours. The teams -- from Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Kolkata, Mohali and Mumbai -- have a budget of up to $5 million each for a maximum of eight contracted players. Mahendra Dhoni and Adam Gilchrist, dynamic 'keeper-batsmen from India and Australia, head the wish-lists of all eight teams. "The governing council of the Indian Premier League is pulling out all stops to ensure a free, transparent and fair bidding process for a truly historic first ever auction of cricketers in India," IPL Chairman Lalit Modi said in a statement. Each player will have an annual 'base player fee' under the assumption he is available for the entire season. That fee will be adjusted on a pro-rata basis dependent on availability. AUSTRALIAN GREATS The players will be put up for bidding in sets of 12 according to their annual base price, multiple-skills and expected availability for the inaugural year. Players from India, Sri Lanka and South Africa are available for the entire duration of the 44-day tournament starting on April 18 and featuring 59 matches. Retired Australian greats Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath are available for the whole tournament, however Australian players who figure in both test and one-day cricket have been penned down as unavailable for 2008 owing to national team commitments. This year's Australian tour of Pakistan looks unlikely due to the security situation there, however, and IPL rules allow players to be become part of their teams in the event of them being available at a later date. The player contracts are for a period of three years. The players from Pakistan, West Indies and New Zealand have been marked as partially available due to their national commitments
