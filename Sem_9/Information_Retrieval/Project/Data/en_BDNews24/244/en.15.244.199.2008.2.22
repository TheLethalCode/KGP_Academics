<TITLE> CEC urges BNP to defuse infighting </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said Friday the Election Commission cannot resolve BNP's internal feud. "BNP will have to deal with its own quarrel to sit with the commission for dialogue. The commission has nothing to do with its internal matter. If they (BNP leaders) fail, the commission will simply wait for a court verdict," Huda told reporters, as he inspected voter enrollment in Chittagong. He visited Doulatpur High School at Patia to see for himself voter listing when army personnel described the progress on work. The CEC said it would not be possible to finalise reforms to the electoral laws without having dialogue with the BNP. "This is not a question of favour. This is a political question. The ongoing dialogue with political parties could not be completed without the BNP," he replied to a query. The EC has decided not to sit with any splinter of a party bypassing the "mainstream". "We cannot move away from our stand on it," Huda said. He said the commission would work with all political parties irrespective of their size and popular base. The CEC said his previous thought proved wrong that it would be a difficult task to enroll voters in the remote Chittagong Hill Tracts. Voter registration in the CHT would be completed two months ahead of schedule, he said. Replying to a query on registration of political parties, Huda said the commission would see if a political party has offices and committees in at least 50 districts. For the old parties the commission would consider if they had ever won in any parliamentary seat in the last eight elections, Huda said. bdnews
