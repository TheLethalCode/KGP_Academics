 LONDON, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Europe is preparing to loosen the gags stopping drug firms from commmunicating with patients, fuelling controversy over whether the public will get impartial information on prescription medicines. Manufacturers welcome new proposals to let them disseminate "non-promotional" information through television, radio and other outlets, since it could spur faster uptake of new drugs. Companies have long campaigned against rules that restrict them from talking directly to consumers, despite a wealth of often unreliable information being available on the Internet. Critics, however, fear the plans mark the start of a slippery slope towards hard-sell advertising. In fact, proposals this month from the European Commission make clear that U.S.-style ads for prescription drugs such as Viagra won't be coming to prime-time European TV any time soon. Direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising -- permitted in the United States and New Zealand -- will remained banned, except in the case of over-the-counter or non-prescription medicine, where it is already allowed. Still, activist group Consumers International believes the move marks a crucial breach in a barrier designed to ensure patients only get independent and impartial information. "In the European Commission's eyes, there is a clear difference between giving information and companies advertising. We think this would be advertising in everything but name," said group campaigner Justin Macmullan. Some doctors are also worried. An editorial in the British Medical Journal in September said the move would be "confusing", while encouraging early use of new drugs was risky, as shown by the withdrawal of Merck & Co's Vioxx arthritis drug in 2004 on safety grounds. GOVERNMENT PAYERS Drugmakers insist DTC is not their goal in Europe, in contrast to the United States, where $4.2 billion was spent on such ads in 2005, up 330 percent from 1996, according to a study last year in the New England Journal of Medicine. The strategy reflects the different market structures on either side of the Atlantic, with the U.S. being primarily market-driven, while government payers dominate in Europe. "We do not advocate, nor do we ever expect to advocate, direct-to-consumer advertisements in the U.S. style here in Europe," said Scott Ratzan, European head of government affairs for Johnson & Johnson. But Ratzan, who also chairs the European pharmaceutical association's committee on information to patients, strongly believes drug firms have a role to play in communication. "We need to get people to make better decisions and treat disease early, when it is more cost-effective and you have a better health outcome," he said. Drug firms would like Europe to adopt new medicines faster. Products launched in the last five years represent 27 percent of the U.S. drugs market but only 15 percent in Britain and 21 percent in Germany, according to industry data. Disease awareness campaigns that publicise a condition rather than a cure are likely to be important in the future information landscape. They are already increasingly common in Britain, which, together with Sweden, has a more liberal regime than other European countries. PFIZER BEER MATS British pub goers, for example, were recently greeted by beer mats sponsored by Pfizer urging them to "seek new ways to quit" smoking. No product was mentioned but the campaign coincided with a green light for Pfizer's prescription-only quit smoking drug Champix, which is sold as Chantix in the United States. In a similar vein, Sanofi-Aventis ran posters highlighting the link between obesity and diabetes, following the British launch of its Acomplia weight-loss drug in 2006. Coincidentally, both drugs later ran into safety concerns after being linked to rare cases of suicidal thoughts. Under the new EU proposals, drug companies would have equal freedom to communicate non-promotional, objective material about their medicines across the 27-country bloc. Just what formats would be used remains to be seen. Four companies -- J&J, Pfizer, Novartis and Procter & Gamble -- produced a pilot "European Patient Information Channel" last year to demonstrate the possibilities for video. Such video might appear on pan-European Web sites, although industry officials play down the idea of a pharma TV channel. "I would anticipate cautious experiments, but we need to ensure we don't give anybody grounds for suspicion that this is the thin end of a promotional wedge," said Richard Barker, director general of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Indust
