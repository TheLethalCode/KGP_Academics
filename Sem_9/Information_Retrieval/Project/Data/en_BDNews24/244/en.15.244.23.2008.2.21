 NEW YORK, Feb 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil steadied near $100 a barrel after hitting a fresh record on Wednesday as supply concerns outweighed worries about the US economy. US crude rose 12 cents to $100.13 a barrel at 1838 GMT after vaulting to a record $100.40 earlier, eclipsing the previous high of $100.10 struck on Tuesday. London Brent traded down 55 cents to $98.01 a barrel. Crude futures broke into triple digits for the first time in early January, before concerns that wider US economic problems could damp demand in the world's top consumer sent prices tumbling. Concerns the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will hold or even cut output when it meets on March 5 helped push prices higher -- as well as uncertainty about Venezuelan and Nigerian supplies -- helped prices rebound.

A Reuters poll of analysts forecast a 2.3 million barrel rise in US crude inventories in the week to Feb. 15 and a 1.1 million barrel gain in gasoline stocks. Distillates were forecast to have fallen 1.7 million barrels. News that Nigerian oil delta rebel leader Henry Okah had been shot dead, later debunked by a government spokesman, lent strength to oil on Tuesday. US refinery problems and the row between Venezuela and Exxon Mobil also lifted prices. The gains came alongside rallies for platinum and soybeans as commodities remained in favor among investors seeking to beat returns in other markets, such as equities. "The rally may be less indicative of narrowly defined energy fundamentals than of fund capital's quest for safe havens and financial hedges against inflation," said Antoine Halff, deputy head of research at brokers Newed
