<TITLE> Cyprus election pits communist against right-winger </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Nicosia, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Greek Cypriots vote for a new president on Sunday in an election which has raised hopes of a peace deal on the war-partitioned island, a major hurdle to Turkey's European Union accession hopes. The contest pits Communist candidate Demetris Christofias, 62, against right-winger Ioannis Kassoulides, 59, after last Sunday's surprise elimination of President Tassos Papadopoulos, who led Greek Cypriots in rejecting a 2004 peace plan. Both contenders pledge a more conciliatory approach towards Turkish Cypriots and say they will work to end the stalemate that has also fanned tensions between NATO allies Greece and Turkey. Papadopoulos, 74, was unexpectedly dumped in the first round of voting on Feb. 17, but swiftly turned kingmaker as his party threw its support behind former ally Christofias. Statistically, Christofias is better placed to win, having the support of his own powerful AKEL party and Papadopoulos's Democratic Party behind him in the run-off. Analysts say it is too early to tell how Papadopoulos may influence policy in the event of a Christofias victory. Phrases like "No Regression" and "Assertion" -- buzzwords of the Papadopoulos camp, crept into Christofias's television campaigning this week. But they say that Christofias would be better placed to clinch a deal on Cyprus with Papadopoulos within his camp. "Kassoulides will still have one third of the electorate to deal with, and everyone will have to be brought on board to negotiate what is likely to be a very difficult negotiation process," said James-Ker Lindsay, a Cyprus watcher at Kingston University in London. NEW PEACE BID Divided since a Turkish invasion in 1974 triggered by a brief Greek inspired coup, diplomats have said the island is heading towards permanent partition. Without a settlement, a Greek Cypriot-led Cyprus now representing the island in the EU will never let Ankara into the fold. Mediators are expected to launch a new bid on Cyprus this year, the first since they were stung by a Papadopoulos-led Greek Cypriot rejection of the U.N. peace blueprint in 2004. Turkish Cypriots voted in favour of the plan. Christofias was the key backer of Papadopoulos's tripartite alliance elected in 2003 and supported his rejection of the U.N. plan. He pulled out last year, expressing frustration at Papadopoulos's negotiation tactics. "We can speak a common language with our Turkish Cypriot compatriots," Christofias told supporters in the coastal town of Limassol. Kassoulides, a former foreign minister for the conservative government of Glafcos Clerides, supported the blueprint, but says he accepts that it cannot be revived. "We need to move forward on the Cyprus issue to chart a united line and open up channels of communication with Turkish Cypriots," he told a rally in Nicosia. If Christofias wins, he will be the first communist to lead Cyprus in the island's history and must resign from the leadership of his party. "You know why Fidel Castro resigned? Because he heard a vacancy opened in Cyprus," goes a joke making the rounds of the Cypriot capital.
