<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com) A Dhaka court Wednesday turned down an appeal seeking bail for Khaleda Zia in a case involving Canadian oil and gas company Niko Resources Ltd. Judge Md Azizul Haque of Senior Special Judge Court in Dhaka rejected the petition after hearing the appeal. Lawyers said Khaleda needed bail since she had been suffering from physical ailments. She is also under mental stress, they said. They also assured the court that Khaleda would face the case when she would be on bail. Khaleda's counsels argued that their client was no way involved in any corruption in awarding deals to Niko, and she deserved bail in the case. But the judge was not satisfied and rejected the bail. The lawyers said the deal with Niko for extracting gas from Feni, Kamta and Chhatak fields was penned on June 14, 2001 when Sheikh Hasina was in office. Later, the coalition government led by Khaleda Zia only maintained the continuity of the deal, they said. The accused had no ill motive or design to go ahead with the previous deal, they insisted. The case was filed on December 9, 2007 with Tejgaon Police Station. It showed that the deal and its necessary procedures took place between November 3, 2001 and September, 2005. The counsels said they had no idea why filing of the case took too much time since the alleged crime had taken place two years ago. They said there was no explanation of that in the case documents. On February 14, judge Golam Rabbani of additional chief metropolitan magistrate court-3 had also turned down a motion for bail for Khaleda in the same case. The former prime minister has been in jail since September 3, 2007, pending trial. Lawyers Sanaullah Mian, Masud Ahmed Talukdar and Joynal Abedin Mesbah fought for Kahleda in the court. bdnews24.
