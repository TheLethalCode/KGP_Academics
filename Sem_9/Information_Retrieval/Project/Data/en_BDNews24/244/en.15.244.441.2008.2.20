 BANDA ACEH, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A 7.5 magnitude quake struck off Indonesia's Aceh province on Wednesday killing at least three people and damaging buildings on the nearby island of Simeulue, a local official said. The US Geological Survey said the quake's depth was 34 km (21 miles) and that it occurred at 0808 GMT. No local tsunami warning was issued. The epicentre was about 310 km (190 miles) south-southeast of Banda Aceh, the provincial capital of Aceh province, which was hit by a devastating tsunami in 2004.

The agency recorded at least two aftershocks in the same area about 20 minutes after the first tremor, one measuring 5.5 and the other 5.3 on the Richter scale.

The Hawaii-based Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre issued a tsunami watch for Indonesia but said that a destructive widespread tsunami threat did not exist based on historical earthquake and tsunami data.
