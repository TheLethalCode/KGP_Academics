 Dhaka, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com) -- The Election Commission is set to have talks with three political parties Sunday on the first day of the second round dialogues on electoral reforms. The three parties, to be represented by ten members each, are Bikalpadhara Bangladesh, Workers Party and Samyabadi Dal. The Liberal Democratic Party was originally scheduled to sit with the EC Sunday, but as LDP chairman Oli Ahmed was abroad the Workers Party was invited instead. LDP secretary general Prof Jahanara Begum told bdnews24.com: "As our chairman is abroad we have sent a letter to the chief election commissioner to change the schedule. We want to sit with the Election Commission in three or four days." The party will sit with the commission on Feb 28, said EC senior assistant secretary Forhad Ahmed Khan. "In the second round dialogue with the Election Commission we will raise proposals on electoral campaigns and voting procedure," Bikalpadhara Bangladesh secretary general MA Mannan told bdnews24.com Saturday. "We want an election free of black money. For that the commission should reform a number of rules." Referring to war criminals he said: "We have full support to demand taking steps against those who were against our Liberation War and independence." Samyabadi Dal chairman Dilip Barua told bdnews24.com: "We will prioritise the declaring of political parties with war criminals as members unfit for contesting in the elections." "We also want elections free of black money and terrorism, and reforms to existent rules," he added. The commission held the first round of dialogues with political parties on Sept 12. BNP has yet to hold any dialogue with the Election Commission. The draft electoral reform proposals formulated by the EC include compulsory registration of political parties, making public the candidate's income source and campaigning expenses and declaring loan and tax defaulters and war criminals unfit to stand for election,. bdnews
