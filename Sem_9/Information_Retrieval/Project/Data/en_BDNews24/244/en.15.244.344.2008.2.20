<TITLE> World has eye on Hasina trial: Sloan </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com)The world community is keeping an eye on the trial proceedings of Sheikh Hasina, Canadian lawyer William Sloan said Wednesday. At a discussion meeting with lawyers at the Supreme Court Bar Association, Sloan appointed to Hasina's defence by her family said that though the former prime minster's trial had not been formally declared in camera, the proceedings did not appear to be completely public. Sloan, who is president of the American Jurist Association's Canadian chapter, said there was nothing to hide in the trial of the former prime minister. There should be arrangements so that the public could witness more of the proceedings, he added. Sloan said that though he had previously visited Bangladesh in 2005, the government was not happy with his present visit. He said he faced many problems entering the country and that his motive for coming to Bangladesh was questioned. The Canadian lawyer said he had come to observe the court proceedings and whether the rights of those being tried under special law are being protected -- as many lawyers did throughout the world who fought to protect human rights. But he regretted that he was not given the opportunity to enter the special courtroom. Describing the Feb 6 verdict that dismissed the extortion case against Hasina as "epoch-making", he said the Bangladesh High Court ruling had passed the international human rights standards. He mentioned that in Pakistan too the Supreme Court had shown its power against president Pervez Musharraf. He said that justice could only function properly in a democratic set up; there was no alternative to it in governance. Pakistan's transition to democracy from martial law proved that democracy was the best system for people's welfare, he added. He vowed to submit a report to the United Nations, International Democratic Lawyers' Association, American Jurist Association and other international organisations after observing Hasina's trial process. Sloan, who is a member of the International Democratic Lawyers' Association, also said that people would decide whether Bangladesh would undergo the transition to democracy from the state of emergency and what system of governance would follow. Former president of the Supreme Court Bar Association Barrister Shafique Ahmed said Sloan had come to Bangladesh to see whether the trials of Sheikh Hasina and other detainees were transparent. He attempted to observe Hasina's trial proceedings on Tuesday. But he was not allowed to enter the special courtroom set up on the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban premises. bdnew
