<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com)Responding to strong pressure from both government and the central bank, a nine-strong committee of bank owners and top executives has been tasked to work out likely new interest rates in less than a week. Owners' group Bangladesh Association of Banks (BAB) and executives' forum Association of Bankers Bangladesh (ABB) have jointly formed the committee, with both groups naming four members each. Syed Manzur Elahi, a former BAB chief and a former caretaker adviser, will chair the committee. "The committee will decide on recommended rate cuts for various sectors of business and industry," said Kazi Mahmud Sattar, chair of ABB and managing director of City Bank. Sattar told bdnews24.com Saturday that the recommendations would be submitted to the central bank by the end of the month (February). Commercial banks had previously remained unresponsive to Bangladesh Bank's calls for cuts in overall interest rates, and for lowering the interest rate spread between deposits and loans to within five percentage points. The main sticking point has been the high rate of interest on national savings bonds and government treasury bonds, which make it difficult to competitively reduce the interest rate spread, say bankers. On Jan 29, chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed wrote to central bank boss Salehuddin Ahmed asking Bangladesh Bank to take effective steps towards rate cuts. Following the letter, the finance adviser and the Bangladesh Bank governor sat with commercial bank chairmen in the first week of February. The meeting decided to lower the rate of interest on loans to spur investment. The central bank was directed to formulate necessary guidelines in this regard. After two further meetings last weekwith commercial bank owners and then with top executivesthe regulator gave commercial banks a deadline to lower the rate of interest on loans and reduce the interest rate spread to "tolerable levels". Bangladesh Bank told them to come up with specific proposals by the end of February. Sattar told reporters: "We have agreed to lower the rate of interest on bank loans considering the overall situation of the country." Asked by how much the rate of interest would be reduced, Sattar said: "It would not be proper to say now. If anything was said now, it would have a negative impact on the share market." "However, it is true that that we have agreed to lower interest rate on bank loans without reducing the rate of interest on deposits." bdn
