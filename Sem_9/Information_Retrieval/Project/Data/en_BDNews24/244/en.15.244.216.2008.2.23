<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh were 48 for three at tea in the second innings of the first Test after bowling South Africa out for 170 Saturday. Bangladesh, however, took an overall 70-run lead with Junaed Siddique and Mohammad Ashraful batting on 16 and 9, at Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on the second day of the Test. Dale Steyn caused the damage by removing Tamim Iqbal (2), Shahriar Nafees (16) and Habibul Bashar (2) in a row to reduce the hosts to 29 for three in 10.5 overs. Steyn first bowled Tamim in his second over, and then trapped both Nafees and Bashar leg before in the ninth and the 11th over. Earlier, South Africa were stopped 22 runs short of Bangladesh's first innings total of 192, as paceman Shahdat Hossain produced his best of 6 for 29, eclipsing his previous 5 for 86 against Sri Lanka in Bogra in 2006. Bangladesh took the lead in the first innings for the sixth time in their Test history, three times at home and as many times away. After the lunch break, the 21-year old pacer uprooted Makhaya Ntini's stumps to wrap up South Africa's first innings before trapping Mark Boucher leg before for 11. Just before the lunch break, Shahadat struck a double blow to reduce South Africa to 158 for eight, having Morne Morkel caught out by Mushfiqur for a five-ball one and removing Johan Botha for 25. Mohammad Ashraful broke the 68-run sixth wicket partnership between Botha and AB de Villiers removing the latter in his first delivery of the day. Steve Bucknor gave a controversial out to Villiers, who got a thick edge while trying to pull on an Ashraful double bounce delivery. Villiers, believing it was a dead ball, stayed at the crease until Bucknor raised his fingers. Villiers, who was dropped on 30 by Ashraful off Mohammad Rafique, and survived a bold appeal for lbw from Rafique in the next delivery, scored 46 off 73 balls hitting seven fours and one six. After having resumed the day on 76 for four, South Africa lost an indecisive Prince in the day's second over to be reduced to 77 for five. Prince was unable to make up his mind after driving Shahadat at cover, and keeper Mushfiqur Rahim did not hesitate to whip off the bails from a throw by Shakib Al Hasan. South Africa added 94 losing remaining wickets on the day to finish at 170 all out, allowing the hosts to a 22-run lead. bd
