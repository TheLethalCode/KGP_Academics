 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com Telecoms Correspondent Dhaka, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com)Twenty-eight private firms Wednesday took part in open bidding to clinch two licences for interconnection exchanges (ICXs), part of the long-distance telephony infrastructure. Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission organised the auction at Radisson Water Garden Hotel to award licences to only two firms who would agree to share the highest percentage of revenue with the telecoms regulator. The bidding continued into Wednesday night. Domestic and international calls will travel through the ICXs to landline and mobile users. The ICXs will be set up in the private sector in addition to the existing ICX of state-owned Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board. Each of the two operators will be able to set up three interconnection exchanges, according to the regulatory and licensing guidelines. Two exchanges will be located in Dhaka and one will be in Chittagong, Khulna, Sylhet and Bogra each. Earlier, on Tuesday, the BTRC sold three international gateway licences to the private companies to carry overseas calls in and out of Bangladesh, ending BTTB's monopoly over internet telephony. The commission invited bids in October 2007 for the ICX licences from Bangladeshi enterprises under the International Long Distance Telecommunication Services Policy 2007, which bars the existing telecoms licence holders and foreign firms from taking part in the bidding. Wednesday's bidding took off with an offer to share 20 percent of total revenues with the BTRC. The commission has also fixed Tk 5 crore in acquisition fees for each exchange licence initially for 15 years. The interconnection exchanges will have connections to international gateways and all access network service operators must interconnect through the exchanges. bdn
