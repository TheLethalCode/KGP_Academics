 Dhaka, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed urged sportsmen to carry activities ahead in "this era of globalisation". The head of the caretaker government made the call Friday while addressing the inauguration of the 2nd Indo-Bangladesh Bangla Games at Bangabandhu National Stadium. "We have to go ahead in all disciplines including sports in this era of globalisation," said Fakhruddin in his speech. Fakhruddin hoped that the Indo-Bangladesh Bangla Games would remain an icon of friendship between Bangla-speaking peoples from both sides of the border. The Bangladesh Olympic Association (BOA) president and army chief, General Moeen U Ahmed, and the president of the Olympic Association of West Bengal, Kamolesh Chatterjee, also spoke. "There were some shortcomings at the inaugural meet in Kolkata, but we hope the games to be a successful one this time," said Chatterjee adding that they were impressed at Bangladesh's hospitality. A colourful opening ceremony included para-drops with the flags of Bangladesh, India, Bangladesh Olympic Association and the games, march past, cultural show by Kolkata team, confetti, fireworks, a laser show and live concert staged by Souls, Sonia and Pathik Nabi. Singer Ayub Bachchu sang the theme song, and Shilpakala Academy artistes danced for the theme song music. Qumrunnahar Dana, national sports awardee and general secretary of the Bangladesh Women's Sports Association, swore in the participating athletes. Though the curtain of the games was raised Friday, the competition gets underway Saturday at 14 venues.
