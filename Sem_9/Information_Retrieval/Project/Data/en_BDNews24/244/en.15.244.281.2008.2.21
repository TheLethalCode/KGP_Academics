 BEIJING, Feb 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A leading Chinese newspaper has accused the United States of hypocrisy in criticising other nations' space ambitions while rejecting a proposed space treaty and firing a missile to destroy one of its own satellites. The United States hit one of its own dying spy satellites with a missile on Wednesday, Washington time -- Thursday in Beijing -- citing fears that a normal re-entry would risk lives.

The paper said Washington was "desperately trying to explain away" its satellite shoot-down as "for purely non-military objectives". Nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction are banned from space under a 1967 international treaty, but Washington's plans have caused concerns about non-nuclear arms in spa
