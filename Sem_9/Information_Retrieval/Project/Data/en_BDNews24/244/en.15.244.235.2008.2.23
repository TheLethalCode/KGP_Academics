 Sulaimanya, Iraq, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kurdish rebels have killed 22 Turkish soldiers in clashes in northern Iraq, a spokesman for the rebel Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) said on Saturday. "After clashes yesterday between the PKK and the Turkish forces, 22 Turkish soldiers were killed. Not more than five PKK soldiers were wounded," Ahmed Danees, head of foreign relations for the PKK, told Reuters by satellite phone. "Turkish forces used helicopters to evacuate the wounded," he said, speaking from an undisclosed location. The Turkish military said on Friday that 24 PKK rebels and five soldiers had been killed in clashes after it launched a cross-border operation late on Thursday. Verifying information from either side is difficult as the fighting is taking place in an inaccessible mountainous region. Danees said there were no clashes on Saturday, although Turkish warplanes and helicopters had attacked targets along the border. There were no reports of any injuries. Hoshand Bawani, spokesman for Iraq's northern Dahuk province, which borders southern Turkey, said Turkish artillery had pounded targets in the Amadiya district over a two-hour period on Saturday morning.
