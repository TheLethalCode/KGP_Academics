 CAPE TOWN, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa's corporate tax rate will fall by one percentage point to 28 percent to help boost economic growth that is expected to slow to 4 percent in 2008. Finance Minister Trevor Manuel also announced in his 2008/09 budget speech on Wednesday the budget surplus, first achieved last year, would stay in place for the next three years at least, despite an increase in spending. Exchange controls were lifted further, with controls for institutional investors replaced by prudential regulation. Manuel said the economy remained resilient in the face of a global "storm", allowing for a further increase in social expenditure, albeit at a slower than in 2007/08. "As we present a picture of where we are now we must also tell South Africans and the world that our ship is stronger and we are better prepared than during previous episodes of global turmoil," Manuel said. "It is time for neither gloom nor panic. But the course ahead would be somewhat tougher." Economic growth was expected to slow from 5.0 percent in 2007 to 4.0 percent -- down from the 4.5 percent forecast in October -- before accelerating to 4.6 percent in 2010. The revision reflected an energy crisis that has hit production, slower global growth and an anticipated slowdown in consumer spending in response to previous interest rate hikes. The rate increases would, however, help to bring inflation back to the central bank's target range by the end of this year. The deficit on the current account would continue to widen as investment spending, including expenditure on infrastructure projects, increased, reaching 8 percent of gross domestic product for 2010. It measured 8.1 percent of GDP in the third quarter of 2007 -- a near three-decade record -- and was forecast at 7.2 percent for the year as a whole. "STRONG BUDGET" Manuel said higher growth over the past few years, a broader tax-based and improved corporate tax compliance gave scope to cut the company rate to 28 percent from 29 percent. "This will contribute to lowering the cost of capital for new investment." The Treasury also finalised the shift to a dividend withholding tax from the secondary tax on companies, leaving the proposed rate at 10 percent, while personal income tax was adjusted to take account of the impact of inflation. "We can some back to all South Africans again with an incredibly strong budget," Manuel told reporters. "In respect of taxes, a very strong story and I think appropriate to the circumstances." The additional budgeted spending was less than in previous years, and Manuel denied there was pressure from the new leadership of the ruling African National Congress to send more. "A more moderate rate of expenditure growth will assist in containing overall demand, while protecting public spending in the event of an economic slowdown," the Treasury said. "Whatever groups had hoped we would add, we have surpassed that," the minister added. Electricity utility Eskom [ESCJ.UL] will receive 60 billion in support over five years to help pay for a 343 billion rand capital expenditure programme. The money would come from the budget's contingency reserve rather than through new debt and would be structured through subordinate loans that would defer to the company's debt obligations. Eskom has been unable to meet fast-growing demand, leading to extensive and costly rolling blackouts to protect the power grid from collapse. The utility's total five-year spending programme amount to 343 billion ra
