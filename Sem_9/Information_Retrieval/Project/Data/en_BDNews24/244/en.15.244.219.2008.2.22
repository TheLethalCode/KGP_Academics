 ANKARA, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkey's military has sent 10,000 troops into northern Iraq in a land offensive against Kurdish PKK guerrillas based there, the private broadcaster NTV said on Friday. The military's General Staff said its forces had launched the cross-border land offensive backed by fighter jets on Thursday evening and would return home in the shortest time possible after its goals have been achieved. "The Turkish Armed Forces, which attach great importance to Iraq's territorial integrity and stability, will return home in the shortest time possible after its goals have been achieved," the military's General Staff said in a statement posted on its website. Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has called on his Turkish counterpart to respect Iraq's borders after renewed shelling on Thursday, and President Jalal Talabani accepted an invitation to visit Turkey. The Turkish military confirmed on Friday it had launched a ground offensive backed by fighter jets into northern Iraq overnight to hunt down Kurdish rebels. On Thursday, Iraqi Kurdish officials reported Turkish shelling of northern areas. In a phone call to his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday night, Maliki said Iraq considered the separatist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) rebels a threat to their shared border but urged dialogue to promote security. "Maliki asked Erdogan to respect the sovereignty of Iraq's borders and inviolability of its lands ... and stressed the importance of avoiding a military solution," Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said in a statement. Iraq has repeatedly called for a diplomatic solution to deal with the PKK guerrillas, who use the mountains of northern Iraq as a launchpad for attacks in southern Turkey, but Turkey's government is under domestic pressure to take military action against the rebels. Turkey has massed tens of thousands of troops along its frontier with Iraq and has carried out several small-scale cross-border commando operations and aerial bombing raids against the outlawed PKK. "Maliki also said the Iraqi government supports the security and stability of Turkey and considers the PKK a terrorist organisation that represents a threat to Turkey and the border areas between the two countries," Dabbagh said. A statement on the Iraqi presidency Web site said Talabani had received a phone call from Turkish President Abdullah Gul inviting him to Turkey for talks. It said Talabani had accepted the invite but gave no date for the visit. A spokesman for the Kurdish Peshmerga security forces Jabbar Yawar on Thursday said the Turkish military had shelled several Kurdish rebel positions in a remote mountainous area. Turkish planes on Thursday staged attacks near Amadiya, close to the Turkish border in Dahuk province, for three hours but it was not clear what the targets were. Yawar said no casualties were reported. A senior Iraqi border official said Turkish troops tried to move tanks from a base in northern Iraq, but Peshmerga forces had told them to stay in the compound. Turkey has kept small contingents of troops at several bases in northern Iraq since offensives in the 1990s. NATO member Turkey says it has the right under international law to hit PKK rebels who take shelter in northern Iraq and have mounted attacks inside Turkey that have killed scores of troops in recent mont
