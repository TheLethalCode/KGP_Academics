 Md Asaduzzaman Asad bdnews24.com Correspondent Benapole, Feb 21 (bdnews24.com)Bangladeshis and many others from West Bengal, united by the thread of language but divided by a geographical barrier, have observed International Mother Language Day together in no-man's land. Twenty organisations from Bangladesh and West Bengal arranged the gathering where their representatives laid wreaths at the new Shaheed Minar, close to Benapole in Jessore. Two neighbouring land ports Benapole and Petrapole wore a different look, with both sides of the border decorated with flags of the two countries. All border barriers remained ineffective for several hours. Artists, litterateurs, journalists and cultural workers from both Banglas crossed the barbed-wire fencing to reach the venue. The cultural organisations have been jointly observing Ekushey in no-man's land since 2002, Sammilito Sangskritik Jote's Jessore unit president Harun Rashid told bdnews24.com. The only difference is, this year's programme was on a larger scale. Maulana Md Abu Musa launched "Ekush", the Mother Language Day publication of Dhakurnagar Shilpa O Shahitya Sangsad of West Bengal. Sharsha Upazila Nirbahi Officer Basheer Ahmed said: "The get- together marks unity among Bangalees of both countries." Indian lawmaker Amitabh Nandi said: "There is no other instance of making such sacrifice for establishing the honour of mother language in the world. This is the reason Unesco has honoured the day as International Mother Language Day. This is a great achievement of the Bangalees." bdnews24.c
