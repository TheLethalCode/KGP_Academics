 Dhaka, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com) -- A consignment of 42 cultural artefacts returned home from France Saturday. An Air France cargo flight carrying 10 cartons touched down at Zia International Airport just after 6.00 am, received by cultural affairs adviser Rasheda K Chowdhury along with other officials. The relics were sent to France for an exhibition at Guimet Museum amid protests by local art lovers and conservationists who feared that replicas instead of originals would be returned to Bangladesh. Rasheda told reporters at the airport that tight security was in place. She said the artefacts would be restored to the National Museum. "I am happy that the artefacts have returned safely," she said. A high profile committee led by the cultural affairs adviser was previously formed to oversee the whole process and ensure that the cultural artefacts were returned to their place safely. "We will examine the artefacts to drive out any suspicion," she said, adding the committee was taking all necessary precautions. Jean Romnicianu, deputy head of mission for the French Embassy in Dhaka, was also present at the airport. He ruled out any allegations of replicas being made, saying: "to us it's not even a question." Bangladesh can examine the relics. "We will welcome it," he said. Director general of the National Museum Dr Samar Paul told bdnews24.com: "The cartons will be opened in the presence of officials from the cultural ministry, national museum, foreign affairs ministry and the French Embassy." "Later they will be taken to the museum amid tight security," he said. Stringent security measures were taken at the airport to ensure the safety of the relics. The Rapid Action Battalion and armed police were deployed at the airport terminal. Officials of the cultural affairs ministry said some 33,000 euros were spent in the transportation and insurance of the relics. The Bangladesh government is paying 9,000 euros while the remaining 24,000 euros will be paid by the French authorities. Officials of the National Museum, archaeology directorate and Barendra Museum were returning home by the same aircraft along with the consignment of artefacts, said ministry officials. The archaeological relics were earlier packed into cartons, crated and sealed officially at the airport in Paris in the presence of the officials. The 42 artefacts were originally sent to France for exhibition in Paris on Nov 30 last year. A second consignment of 145 cultural artefacts were packed in 13 cartons were also readied for dispatch to the Guimet Museum on Dec 21. The government cancelled the latter shipment after two rare Vishnu statues went missing from the airport's cargo house, resulting in the resignation of former cultural adviser Ayub Quadri. Of the shipment that arrived back Saturday, cultural secretary Sharful Alam told bdnews24.com: "An exhibition will be held next week in Dhaka with the returned artefacts. Everybody will have the chance to see them." bdnews24
