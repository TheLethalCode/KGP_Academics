 LONDON, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's leading share index fell 1.2 percent by mid-session on Wednesday as Vodafone slipped on a possible price war in the US and Alliance & Leicester tumbled after warning on margins. Index heavyweight Vodafone shed 3.5 percent after its joint venture in the United States, Verizon Wireless, said it had started offering flat-rate plans for unlimited calls, raising investor concerns that a price war could break out. At 1122 GMT, the FTSE 100 was down 74.2 points at 5,892.7 points, after advancing 3.1 percent in the past two sessions. "We didn't get off to a good start. Wall Street was turned in backward late in the session due to elevated oil prices. That was compounded by an effective profit warning from Alliance & Leicester," said Keith Bowman, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. "The market is likely to remain volatile ... Add to that, in the background we've still got the outcome of talks of monoline insurers taking place." Banks were among the worst hit, after Alliance & Leicester suffered a double blow from the impact of financial market turmoil, warning of sharply higher funding costs and revealing a big writedown on the value of risky assets. Alliance & Leicester fell 8.4 percent, while HBOS, Bradford & Bingley, Lloyds TSB, HSBC and Standard Chartered lost between 1.3 and 2.2 percent. But Barclays, Britain's third-biggest bank, rose 1.2 percent as traders said investors were switching out from Alliance & Leicester. "Alliance & Leicester figures are pretty appalling. People see the sector's safest stock is Barclays, because their figures were clearly in the opposite way from Alliance & Leicester. A lot of switching is going on," a trader said. The market was also troubled by news that KKR Financial Holdings had deferred repayment of debt due on Feb. 15. The listed affiliate of private equity group Kohlberg Kravis Roberts said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that the maturity date on the debt had been extended to March 3. Investors will be able to assess how US inflation is developing when consumer prices data is released at 1330 GMT. SLIPPERY OILS Oil shares fell as crude prices retreated after climbing nearly 5 percent to a record above $100 a barrel a day ago. Both Royal Dutch Shell and gas producer BG Group lost 1.2 percent. BP dropped 1.7 percent after going ex-dividend. Miners were mixed, with Xstrata, Kazakhmys and Lonmin up. Anglo American was flat after it posted a 6 percent rise in full-year profit, in line with forecasts, and said a global credit crisis would delay the disposal of its road surface business Tarmac. BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto were down between 2.1 and 1.9 percent, respectively. Rio also traded without dividend rights. Rexam added 4.3 percent after the world's biggest maker of drinks cans said it met forecasts with a 7 percent fall in underlying annual profit and it expected to return to profit growth in 2008. Drugmaker Shire advanced 4 percent ahead of its results on Thursday. On the other hand, Carnival and Scottish & Southern Energy fell after it, too, went ex-divide
