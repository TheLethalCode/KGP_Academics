 Dhaka, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com)Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed has said free flow of information works as the driving force behind democracy and good governance and as a bridge between people and the government. The chief adviser made the observation Wednesday while launching a website (www.bgpress.gov.bd) for Bangladesh Government Press from a programme at the Cabinet Division. The website is part of the first recommendation made by the Regulatory Reforms Commission to make public government gazettes, acts, ordinances, rules and government forms. "The recommendation has been implemented today," Fakhruddin said. He thanked all involved in the project. Fakhruddin said, "The government is very sincere to ensure free flow of information by extended use of ICT." The CA said every citizen has the right to information from government and nongovernmental organisations. Different government, semi-government and autonomous bodies are already following the principle by making a citizen's charter. "It ensures accountability to people," he said. "We are preparing the Right to Information Act. Besides, we have formed the Regulatory Reforms Commission to amend and update old, unnecessary and complicated rules." Addressing government officials and employees, Fakhruddin said: "The government officials have to keep in mind that an honest, efficient and knowledge-based administration can ensure good governance. You have to discharge your duties attaching priority to the national interest." Pointing to the government's steps to implement e-governance, the chief adviser said top officials of the public administration and all stakeholders have to take an effective role in building an information society. He said the government would welcome deeper public-private partnership in implementing e-governance. Visitors to the website can read and download Bangladesh gazettes, laws, ordinances, rules and different types of forms, including passport, income tax and birth registration forms, published by the BG Press. Drafts of new rules will be posted on the site seeking public opinion. The site will be linked to the Chief Adviser's Office website (www.bangladesh.gov.bd) Regulatory Reform Commission chairman Akbar Ali Khan and cabinet secretary Ali Imam Majumdar and other high officials attended the programme. bdnews24.c
