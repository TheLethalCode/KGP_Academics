<TITLE> Britain to put aspiring citizens on probation </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Aspiring British citizens will be put on probation for at least one year to show they can speak English, pay taxes and abide by the law, the government said on Wednesday, in its latest move to control immigration. Obtaining a British passport will take at least six years instead of five for highly skilled or skilled workers and migrants will only have access to full benefits once they have passed probation, under new plans presented to parliament. Migrants who cannot show they have integrated into their local community -- through voluntary work or fund-raising for example -- will have to wait for three years before they can apply for citizenship. The changes aim to entice migrants to apply for citizenship and integrate more fully into Britain, while clamping down on those who "languish in limbo" by living in Britain but not adapting to the local way of life. "It is fair to expect people to pay their way, to play by the rules, to speak our language and contribute to the community," said Home Secretary Jacqui Smith. Members of the European Economic Area (EEA) are exempt from the new rules. The changes respond to public concern over the growing number of migrants to Britain following the expansion of the European Union. As in other European countries and the United States, immigration is a major election issue. Britons fear migrants are overstretching public services and benefits. "At a time of change we've responded to reassure Britain about the way in which we can control migration," said Smith. Migrants will also be asked to contribute to a new fund to help communities cope with growing migration. Migrants deemed to be a greater burden on public services -- such as children or elderly relatives -- will pay more than others. Britain has already made changes to its immigration system to control the number of incomers. In March, a new Australian-style points system will come into operation that will measure people on their talents. Other changes include a single border force to guard ports and airports and the fingerprinting of all visa applicants. "The next stage of reform is to make sure those who want to make Britain their home understand the deal that goes with British citizenship," said Smith. People who break the law during the probation period will have their path to citizenship slowed or halted, depending on the gravity of the offence. "If they cannot play by the rules their journey should be halted or slowed down," Smith added. Migrants who do not want full British citizenship can remain as permanent residents, but they must stay on probation for three years -- on top of the initial temporary residence period -- before being granted indefinite leave to rema
