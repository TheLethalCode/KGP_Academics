<TITLE> Japan crown prince to try to visit parents more </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Tokyo, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's Crown Prince Naruhito said he would try to visit his parents more often so that they can see more of their granddaughter, in response to a rare rebuke from a senior palace official. Emperor Akihito complained over a year ago in a news conference that he and his wife, Empress Michiko, had few opportunities to meet Princess Aiko, now 6. After those comments, Naruhito later said he would try to arrange more visits. But this month, Kyodo news agency reported a senior palace official had complained the emperor and empress were still concerned and he had several times urged Naruhito to do more. "I am always grateful for their consideration for Aiko and will do my best to increase the frequency of visits to the Imperial Palace," Naruhito said in remarks made in a news conference and published on Saturday to mark his 48th birthday. But he declined to comment further, saying it was a private family matter. The rigidity of palace life is said to have caused strains within the royal family, and Naruhito's wife, Crown Princess Masako, has long suffered from a mental illness thought to be caused by pressure to bear a male heir. Naruhito said Masako was gradually increasing her official duties which she had scaled back after falling ill. "Masako is slowly getting better but still needs treatment," he said. "She still has her ups and downs but is doing her best to participate in more activities." Masako has recently come under fire in tabloid magazines, some of whom said she was avoiding a full programme of official duties, while finding time to wine and dine with friends.
