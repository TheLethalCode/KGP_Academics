 Kishoreganj, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com) -- Home affairs adviser MA Matin said Saturday that it would be possible to hold general elections under the state of emergency. "I don't know of any legal obstruction to holding the elections during the state of emergency," the adviser said. "In the past, elections have been held during a state of emergency and under martial law." "The right to self expression is fully enjoyed at present, and I am hopeful the elections will be held by December," Matin said to reporters following a meeting with district-level government officials in Kishoreganj. Matin reminded those present that the chief adviser had talked of lifting the state of emergency in phases, adding: "Dialogue between the Election Commission and political parties is ongoing, and political activity is already taking place in a limited way in Dhaka." "The process will further see permission given for political activities throughout the country." "The elections will definitely be completed by December," Matin said. bdnews2
