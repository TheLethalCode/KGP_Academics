 Ljubljana, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Former Slovenian President Janez Drnovsek, an architect of the country's independence from the former Yugoslavia, died after a long battle with cancer, Slovenian news agency STA reported on Saturday. Drnovsek, 57, was Slovenia's last representative in the collective presidency of communist Yugoslavia which comprised all eight constituent parts of the former federation. He was Slovenian prime minister for some 10 years before becoming president in 2002. In opinion polls he was regularly among the most popular politicians in the country. But he didn't run for a second five-year mandate and was replaced by another leftist, Danilo Turk, in December. After being diagnosed with cancer in 1999 he turned to promote healthy lifestyle and vegetarian diet. In the last few years he wrote three books on awareness which instantly became best-sellers in Slovenia and were translated into several languages. As prime minister he played a major role in preparing Slovenia to join the European Union and NATO in 2004 and to become the first former communist country to adopt the euro in 2007
