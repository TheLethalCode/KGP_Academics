<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com)Interest rates on bank loans and service charges are set to come down by March, according to a decision taken at a meeting of bank executives with the Bangladesh Bank governor Wednesday. The organisation of bank owners, Bangladesh Association of Banks (BAB) and the organisation of bank executives, Association of Bankers, Bangladesh (ABB) will jointly send specific proposals on interest rate cuts to the central bank by the end of February. Bangladesh Bank will review the proposals and fix sector-wise rates of interest considering the interests of businessmen, depositors and shareholders. The decision was taken at a meeting of the chief executives of private banks at Bangladesh Bank headquarters in Motijheel with governor Salehuddin Ahmed, a senior central bank official who attended the meeting told bdnews24.com. After the meeting, Salehuddin told reporters, "Like the entrepreneurs, bank executives have also agreed to lower the interest rates on loans." ABB chairman and The City Bank managing director Mahmud A Sattar said, "We have agreed to lower the rates of interest on loans considering the situation of the country. After meeting with BAB, we will send our proposals to the central bank by the end of this month." Sattar refused to give details on how much the rate would be cut. The BB governor said the bank executives had agreed to cut the rates of interest on bank loans, L/Cs, bank drafts, credit cards and other services. On whether the central bank is putting pressure on reducing the interest rates drifting away from the free-market economy policy, Sattar said: "Not at all. The central bank is not putting pressure on us. We have decided through discussion to lower the interest rates for the sake of more investment." Bangladesh Bank has long been giving guidance to the banks to lower interest rates and cut the spread between the interest rates on deposits and loans to 5 percent. bdnews
