 Mahmud Sharif and Reazul Bashar bdnews24.com Correspondents Dhaka, Feb 21 (bdnews24.com)Army chief General Moeen U Ahmed visited the bustling Ekushey Book Fair Thursday on International Mother Language Day. Moeen entered the fair venue around 1pm, escorted by about 50 members of RAB, police and army. Plainclothes police were present across the fair venue at the time. Later the army chief sat at the stall of Asia Publications, the publisher of his book Nirbatchito Sangkolon, a compilation of his lectures, essays and interviews. An Asia Publications official, Saiful Islam, told bdnews24.com at 5m that more than 200 copies of Moeen's book had been sold. The same stall sold 20 copies Wednesday, immediately after the book had been launched at a programme at Kurmitola Golf Club, where another 200 copies were sold. A long queue of autograph seekers was seen in front of the stall Thursday. The security personnel had a tough time tackling the autograph seekers. The army chief stayed at the fair for about half an hour. Coming out of the Asia Publications stall, Moeen went to the Bangla Academy Book Sales Centre. He left the fair venue at about 1.30pm. Moeen wore a black coat and a blue tie inscribed with Bangla letters. bdnews
