 Dhaka, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com) -- Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said Sunday that he hoped half of the voting population would be registered by the end of February. "Some 4 crore voters will be registered by this month which is half of the total voters," Huda said at the Election Commission Secretariat on the first day of second round of talks with political parties. The commission met with Bikalpadhara Bangladesh, the first party of the second round session of dialogues. The commission will also sit with two other parties Sunday, Bangladesh Workers Party and Samyabadi Dal, as scheduled. "We have agreed with the political parties on most of the issues in the first round of talks," the CEC said. Bikalpadhara Bangladesh raised a number of proposals including not allowing agents of candidates in every voting booth, removing election symbols from the ballot paper, allowing mobile services on election day and not registering different factions of the same party. The party also demanded that religious and militant parties be declared unfit for contesting in the polls. The EC is set to hold talks with 15 political parties in its second round dialogues while it is yet to hold any dialogue with the BNP, pending a court decision. bdnews24.com
