 TOKYO, Feb 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A US envoy expressed `great regret' on Thursday over the suspected rape of a 14-year-old girl by a US Marine in Okinawa, southern Japan, as both Washington and Tokyo try to keep the incident from hurting broader ties. The arrest last week of the 38-year-old Marine, Tyrone Hadnott, has rekindled memories of the rape of a 12-year-old girl in Okinawa in 1995, which sparked huge protests against the US bases there and raised concerns about damage to the security relationship.
