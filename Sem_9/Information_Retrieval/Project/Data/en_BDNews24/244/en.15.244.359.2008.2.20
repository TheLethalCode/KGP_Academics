 LONDON, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British manufacturers' order books unexpectedly picked up in February and prices are expected to surge further in the next few months, a survey showed on Wednesday. The Confederation of British Industry's monthly industrial trends survey's total order books balance rose to +3 from +2 in January. Analysts had expected orders books to fall for the first time since October. Policymakers, however, are likely to be worried by a rise in the price expectations balance to +22 from +21, the highest since May. "It is encouraging to see that the slowdown already in train in some sectors of the economy has not yet hit manufacturers," said Ian McCafferty, CBI chief economic advisor. "While manufacturing is not going to be immune to weaker demand at home and abroad, the recent depreciation in sterling will be a helpful boost for exporters over the coming months." The survey was conducted between Jan. 24 and Feb.
