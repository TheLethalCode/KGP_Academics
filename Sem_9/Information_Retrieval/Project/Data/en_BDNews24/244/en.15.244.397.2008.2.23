 Dhaka, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com)  A consignment of 42 artefacts sent to France for an exhibition returned home Saturday. A cargo flight of Air France carrying the artefacts touched Zia International Airport at 6:10 am while cultural affairs adviser Rasheda K Chowdhury was present along with other officials. The relics went to France for the exhibition at Guimet Museum amid protest by local art lovers and conservationists who said France could make replicas and the country might not get the original ones. Rasheda told reporters at the airport that a tight security was in place. She said the artefacts would be sent back to the National Museum. "I am happy that the artefacts have returned safely," she said. "We will examine the artefacts to drive out any suspicion," she said, adding she is heading a committee that will take all necessary measures. Jean Romnicianu, deputy head of mission of French Embassy in Dhaka, was also present at the airport. He ruled out any allegation of making replica and said "to us it's not even a question." He said France regularly organises such exhibitions with reputation. bdn
