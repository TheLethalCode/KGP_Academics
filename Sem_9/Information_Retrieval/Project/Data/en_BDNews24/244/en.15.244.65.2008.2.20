 SINGAPORE, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil retreated on Wednesday, after surging nearly 5 percent to a record above $100 a day ago, on fresh influx of capital into commodities, with focus turning to US stocks data that are expected to show a build in crude. US crude slid 73 cents to $99.28 a barrel by 0647 GMT after investors paused for thought following Tuesday's $4.51 a barrel surge.

While supply concerns have unnerved traders, US supplies still appear healthy, with crude oil stocks expected to have risen for a sixth-straight time last week as imports increased and refinery utilisation held steady. Crude stocks were expected to rise by 2.3 million barrels, while distillates were seen falling by 2 million barrels and gasoline building by 600,000 barrels, a preliminary Reuters poll showed ahead of data due on Thursday, a day later than usual due to Monday's public holiday. "There could be a march northwards from here on, but we'll have to watch the next few days and see where prices settle," Commodity Warrants' McGuire sa
