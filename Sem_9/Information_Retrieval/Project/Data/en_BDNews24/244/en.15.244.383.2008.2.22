 HONG KONG, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hong Kong stocks fell on Friday as weak US economic data stoked fears that the world's biggest economy may have slid into recession, prompting investors to sell across the board. Bourse operator Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEx), now trading at September levels, sank further amid dwindling market turnover and a Goldman Sachs downgrade. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said an index of manufacturing shrank again in the US mid-Atlantic region in its worst reading in seven years. The data is the latest in a series of indicators pointing to the possibility of a recession. "A soft landing has been priced in, but anything worse than that hasn't been priced in yet," said Erwin Sanft, head of Hong Kong and China research at BNP Paribas. "We see a hard landing for corporate earnings and this earnings season should be the worst since 2002," Sanft said, referring to the last major bear market, which began in 2000 and bottomed around October 2002. The benchmark Hang Seng Index ended at 23,305.04. The China Enterprises Index of Hong Kong-listed mainland companies, or H shares, finished down 1.7 percent. Mainboard turnover came to HK$73.89 billion ($9.48 billion) compared to Thursday's HK$75.4 billion. HKEx, one of the day's most heavily traded stocks, dropped for a third straight day, ending down 4.1 percent at HK$146.90. Goldman Sachs cut the stock to neutral from buy, saying a slowing Chinese economy and a possible US recession would likely dampen market sentiment. Metal stocks, one of the session's few bright spots, found support after global copper prices hit 21-month highs and gold set yet another peak. Jiangxi Copper jumped 3.5 percent to HK$18.90. Gold producer Zijin Mining climbed 1.8 percent to HK$10.38. Aluminum Corp of China (Chalco), the country's top producer of the metal, jumped 0.9 percent to HK$15.08. Investors also took shelter in defensive stocks. Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd leapt 3.6 percent. Investors sold shipping stocks, seen as a proxy for demand in the overall global economy. China COSCO skidded 3.1 percent and Pacific Basin tumbled 3.2 percent. Shares in Hong Kong property developers underperformed a day after HSBC Holdings said the city's banks may not follow any further rate cuts in the United States. The Hang Seng sub-index of property shares fell 2 percent. Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd dropped 2.35 percent. Henderson Land declined 4.1 percent. (US$1=HK$7
