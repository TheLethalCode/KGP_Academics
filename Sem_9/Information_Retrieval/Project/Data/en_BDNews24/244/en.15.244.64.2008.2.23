<TITLE> South Africa in deep trouble </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com)  Paceman Shahadat Hossain struck a double blow as South Africa were in deep trouble with 154 for eight at lunch on the second day of the first Test against Bangladesh at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium Saturday. Mark Boucher remained unbeaten on 11. The visitors were still trailing by 34 runs with two wickets in hands after Bangladesh were bundled out for 192 on the first day. Morne Morkel was the latest to go, caught behind keeper Mushfiqur Rahim off Shahadat for a five-ball one. Shahadat also trapped Johan Botha lbw for 25 after Mohammad Ashraful broke the 68-run sixth wicket partnership between Botha and AB de Villiers removing the latter. Steve Bucknor gave a controversial out to Villiers, who got a thick edge while trying to pull on an Ashraful double bounce delivery. Villiers, believing it was a dead ball, stayed at the crease until Bucknor raised his fingers. Villiers, who was dropped on 30 by Ashraful off Mohammad Rafique, and survived a bold appeal for lbw from Rafique in the next delivery, scored 46 off 73 balls hitting seven fours and one six. After having resumed the day on 76 for four, South Africa lost an indecisive Prince in the day's second over to be reduced to 77 for five. Prince was unable to make up his mind after driving Shahadat at cover, and keeper Mushfiqur Rahim did not hesitate to whip off the bails from a throw by Shakib Al Hasan. bdn
