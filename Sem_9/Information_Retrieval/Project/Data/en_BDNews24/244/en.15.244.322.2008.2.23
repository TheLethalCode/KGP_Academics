<TEXT>
 Juba, Sudan, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Uganda's Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) rebels and government signed a ceasefire on Saturday in another major step towards a final peace settlement to their two-decade war that mediators say may be signed next week. "It is the laying down of arms. It is the end of the war," U.N. envoy Joaquim Chissano said after the parties signed the "permanent ceasefire" agreement during their fast-progressing talks in southern Sudan's capital Juba. With only a demobilisation deal left to be agreed on, negotiators and mediators like Chissano are predicting a final accord will be reached within days. After a tortuous process since talks began in mid-2006, the speed of progress in recent days has taken observers by surprise, particularly after the LRA delegation walked out at one point this week in a row over cabinet jobs and cash. Their revolt against President Yoweri Museveni since 1986 has devastated north Uganda, killed tens of thousands of people, uprooted nearly 2 million, and become infamous for the brutal methods of the rebels including mutilating victims.
