 Baghdad, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A series of mortar or rocket explosions rocked Baghdad on Saturday as a siren wailed in the heavily fortified Green Zone, home to the US embassy and Iraqi government, warning people to take cover. It was not immediately clear where the missiles landed or whether there were any casualties, Reuters witnesses said. The US military has blamed missile attacks on the Green Zone on so-called "special groups", rogue elements of Moqtada al-Sadr's Mehdi Army militia they say receives funding and weapons from neighbouring Iran. Iran denies the charge. On Friday, Sadr renewed a six-month ceasefire which he first called in August to reorganise his splintered militia. The US military welcomed the extension but said it would continue to hunt down the rogue units.
