 YEREVAN, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Armenian Prime Minister Serzh Sarksyan has won a clear victory in a presidential election, according to official figures, but opposition parties prepared protests on Wednesday, saying the contest was rigged. Sarksyan, who has vowed to continue the policies of his ally, incumbent president Robert Kocharyan, took 52.86 percent of the votes, the Central Election Committee said. This was enough for outright victory in the first round. Landlocked Armenia lies high in the Caucasus mountains between Turkey and Azerbaijan, two states with which it has strained relations. The ex-Soviet republic has emerged as an important transit region for oil exports from the Caspian Sea to world markets but lacks significant resources of its own. Sarksyan's nearest challenger, former president Levon Ter- Petrosyan, won 21.5 percent of the votes, according to preliminary official figures. Current president Kocharyan congratulated Sarksyan on his victory in what he called free and fair elections. But the opposition alleged that ballot-stuffing and beating of its supporters had marred the vote and called protests later in the day. A note on Ter-Petrosyan's campaign website said he had won the election. "Today there will be a massive protest," said Nikol Pashinyan, an aide to Ter-Petrosyan. "It will be a crime if we let power and our country stay in the hands of the regime of Sergh Sarksyan and Robert Kocharyan." Ter-Petrosyan, who accuses the present administration of tolerating corruption, failing to uphold the rule of law and pushing Armenia into international isolation, was Armenia's first president after the collapse of the Soviet Union. He ruled from 1991 until 1998, when he resigned under pressure and ceded power to Kocharyan. NAGORNO-KARABAKH With both the Turkish and Azeri land borders closed because of disputes, Armenia relies heavily on a close political and military alliance with Moscow and, despite a recent spurt in economic growth, remains poor compared to its neighbours. Analysts say a still-unresolved conflict with neighbouring Muslim Azerbaijan over the separatist enclave of Nagorno- Karabakh -- controlled by Armenians after a bitter war in the 1990s -- could flare up again into violence. Stalled efforts to reach a peace deal are likely to be the biggest challenge facing the new president. Ter-Petrosyan was forced to resign as president after advocating concessions to settle the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Election observers from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe were to give their verdict on the vote later on Wednesday. Their assessment is likely to be a key factor in whether the opposition protests build momentum. Previous elections in Armenia, an ancient Christian nation, have been followed by days of opposition protests alleging ballot fraud. A new round of protests will be a test for stability in a country which, in the 1990s, was rocked by political convulsio
