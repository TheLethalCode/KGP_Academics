 BELGRADE, Feb 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serbia plans to stage a mass protest rally in Belgrade on Thursday against Kosovo's declaration of independence, underlining Serb anger at the loss of their religious heartland. But analysts say it would be wrong to interpret Serbia's reaction as a return to the virulent nationalism that stoked war in the Balkans in the 1990s under the leadership of the late Slobodan Milosevic. Although Kosovo is a highly emotive issue for them, the bitterness felt by Serbs does not alter the fact that more than 70 percent see their future in the European Union. The planned so-called "People's Rally" in Belgrade is very much a government-sponsored event.

"The anger Serbs feel right now is understandable, it's part of the process that comes before acceptance," a Belgrade-based Western analyst said on condition of anonymity. "But long-term prospects for Serbia are very good, if the West is patient and lets them go through this difficult time." On Wednesday, UN police backed by NATO peacekeepers reopened two Kosovan border crossings, a day after Serbs burned them down in the first challenge to the authority of the newly independent republic. In 1999 NATO intervened in Kosovo to stop mass killings of civilians by Serb forces in a two-year counter-insurgency war. The United Nations then took over the administration of Koso
