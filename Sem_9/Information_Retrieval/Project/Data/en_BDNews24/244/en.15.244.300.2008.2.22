 BRDO, Slovenia, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European Union officials called on Serbia on Friday to do more to protect foreign embassies targeted in protests against Kosovo's secession, warning the violence could have an impact on EU-Serbian ties. EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana told reporters at an EU event in Slovenia that the violence could harm progress on a preliminary deal on ties with the European Union, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA).

"I only wish the Serbian police had intervened more quickly," said German Defence Minister Franz Josef Jung, echoing US complaints of a lack of protection for foreign missions. Solana praised a statement by Serbia's pro-European President Boris Tadic trying to calm the situation but said the authorities' response as a whole had been insufficient. "I don't think that in other places the behaviour of the authorities was of the same manner (as Tadic's)," he said. Some 200,000 people attended the state-backed rally and officials said police were overwhelmed by the biggest march since protesters stormed the old Yugoslav parliament building in 2000 to oust nationalist leader Slobodan Milosevic. But police were nowhere to be seen when just a few score rioters -- many wearing balaclavas -- attacked the US embassy for the second time in a we
