 SINGAPORE, Feb 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Stocks rallied on Thursday as solid earnings and expectations of further US interest rate cuts outweighed worries aboutinflation even as oil hit a record high above $101 a barrel. Gold also hit a record above $945 an ounce, and silver touched a 27-year high, as funds poured into a wide range of commodities, betting they will outperform in an environment where growth is slowing and prices are rising. Data on Wednesday showed a faster-than-expected rise in US consumer prices last month and further weakness in the housing market there. "The US is entirely focused on the economic data that is coming out and we're getting revised forecasts for their economic growth in the downward trend," said Savanth Sebastian, equities economist at CommSec in Sydney. "(The Federal Reserve) will have to cut rates and the possibility of that is boosting sentiment." The weak housing market and problems in the credit market prompted the Fed to lower its 2008 US economic growth forecasts on Wednesday, with analysts interpreting comments as paving the way for further reductions in borrowing costs. Japan's benchmark Nikkei rose 2.1 percent, trimming most of Wednesday's losses, while MSCI's index of other Asian stocks gained 1.2 percent by 0247 GMT. Since tumbling more than 10 percent in January, Asia stocks have endured choppy, volatile trade and investors are wary of calling an end to that. "It's like a Japanese saying about a winter season around this time; three cold days and four warm days," said Katsuhiko Kodama, senior strategist at Toyo Securities. Taiwan stocks rose 1.6 percent, in line with Hong Kong, but Shanghai fell more than 2 percent on concerns about further new share issues flooding the market. Australian stocks added 1 percent, helped by solid earnings from phone company Telstra, pallet maker Brambles and national carrier Qantas. CREDIT CONCERNS While equities have been running hot and cold, commodity markets have blazed higher. "There's been a movement of investment funds from other asset classes to commodities again, and I think gold has benefited from that move," said Darren Heathcote of Investec Australia. Crude oil hit a peak of $101.32, near its all-time inflation adjusted high of $101.70 hit in April 1980, according to the International Energy Agency. Gold's rise lifted silver to $17.90 an ounce, its highest since December 1980, and Malaysian palm oil futures also hit a record high. Asian technology companies led the way up after a strong profit outlook from computer and printer maker Hewlett-Packard Co , which lifted Wall Street indexes by nearly 1 percent. "HP's forecast-beating profits indicated tech product demand in the U.S. market has not been hit by the subprime crisis as hard as investors had worried," said James Wang, chief investment officer of Capital Securities Investment Trust in Taiwan. But credit markets highlighted the ongoing risks from the crisis, which has hammered earnings of financial companies, dried up funding for deals and dragged down U.S. house prices. Indexes of U.S and European corporate bonds widened to record levels above safe-haven government paper on Wednesday, further limiting the availability of credit. Concerns were that traders were unwinding some of their complex structured credit trades and seeking greater protection on others, further pressuring spreads. BONDS FALL Government bond prices were also under pressure with Japanese government bond futures falling half a point as the rise in equity markets and better-than expected Japanese trade data weighed. "JGBs took a hit as the trade data was surprisingly good, showing that exports to Europe and Asia stayed firmer than previously thought," said Tetsuya Miura, a bond strategist at Shinko Securities. Currency markets were locked in trading ranges, with the dollar giving up gains made in the wake of the strong inflation data after the Fed's weaker assessment of the economy. The dollar was buying 108.17 yen while the euro was at $1.4
