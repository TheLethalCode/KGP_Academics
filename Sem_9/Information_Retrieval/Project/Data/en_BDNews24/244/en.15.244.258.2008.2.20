<TITLE> Vernalis axes jobs, CEO as UK biotech faces crunch </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Vernalis became the latest potential takeover target in a hard-pressed British biotech sector on Wednesday after dumping its chief executive and cutting over half the workforce to preserve cash. Vernalis also said it would settle a $56 million loan from its partner, Endo Pharmaceuticals, in a move analysts said left the door open for possible bids. "Without a CEO and without the loan, the probability increases that someone will approach them," said Sam Fazeli, an industry analyst at Piper Jaffray. Shares in Vernalis jumped 6.3 percent to 7.78 pence by 0935 GMT on the news, valuing the small-cap group at around 26 million pounds ($50.7 million). The restructuring at Vernalis comes just one day after Scottish biotech firm, Ardana, announced it was seeking a sale or merger. Two weeks ago, CeNeS Pharmaceuticals said it was in takeover talks. Small biotech companies are struggling because of the current market downturn and credit crunch, which has made it difficult for them to raise fresh cash. "Every time there is a downturn or a bear market there are a few companies that get to the point where they cannot continue to finance themselves," Fazeli said. "But there are also quite a lot of companies going into this downturn with sizeable cash balances, like Vectura, Protherics, Antisoma, BTG, Biocompatibles," he added. The problems at Vernalis stem from last year's surprise rejection of its key drug Frova as a treatment for menstrual migraine in the United States. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration rejection meant Vernalis missed out on some $40 million in milestone payments from Endo and left its future funding unclear. Under the terms of the loan settlement with Endo, Vernalis will pay $7 million and the British company will forgo future royalties on US sales of Frova until annual US net sales exceed $85 million. The drug is already marketed for acute migraine. Vernalis said it will reduce headcount from 210 to about 90, although it would retain a research and development workforce. The restructuring, expected to be completed in the second quarter of this year, will leave cash use at less than 10 million pounds ($19.5 million) a year. It had cash resources at end-December of 20.5 million pounds. "The strategic restructuring will enable the company to focus upon its innovative discovery programmes and progress its development programmes to the point at which they can be partnered," Vernalis said in a statement. "The headcount reductions ... will be larger in corporate and other areas than in research and development, where it is planned to retain a critical mass that will ensure that Vernalis' ongoing programmes are effectively pursued and remain fully competitive," it add
