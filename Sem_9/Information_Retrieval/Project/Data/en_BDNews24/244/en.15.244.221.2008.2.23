 AMSTERDAM, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Netherlands coach Marco van Basten has signed a four-year deal to become manager of Ajax Amsterdam, the Dutch club said on Friday. Van Basten announced in December he would step down from the national team after Euro 2008 in Austria and Switzerland. The Ajax Web site (www.ajax.nl) said he would take over on July 1 from Adrie Koster who succeeded Henk ten Cate on a temporary basis after he joined Chelsea last October. It will be the 43-year-old Van Basten's third spell at the Amsterdam club where he began his playing career in 1981 and remained until 1987 when he joined AC Milan. He scored 151 goals in 172 games for Ajax, winning the Dutch title several times as well as the league and cup double in 1983 and the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1987. After a trophy-laden career, including two European Cups with Milan and a European Championship, Van Basten retired from playing in 1995 aged 28 after a series of ankle operations. He rejoined Ajax in 2000 as youth coach. In 2004 the former European and World Player of the Year succeeded Dick Advocaat as Netherlands coach and has led the national team to the 2006 World Cup and Euro 2008. Van Basten's assistant coaches at Ajax will be the club's former players John van't Schip and Rob Witschge. "We are very pleased with three ambitious coaches who have a history at Ajax," said technical director Martin van Geel. "They all had international careers as players and will bring the necessary experience as coaches.
