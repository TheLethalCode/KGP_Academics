 Moscow, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia said on Wednesday a European Union plan to send a mission to Kosovo breached international law and was an example of the West's double standards in recognising Kosovo's independence from Serbia. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the West had crudely broken international law by pushing for Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence, which Russian diplomats say will stir up strife in the Balkans. The EU has agreed to send a police, justice and administrative mission to Kosovo to support the authorities there and help keep order in the wake of independence. "The European Union, unilaterally, and without any sanction from the UN Security Council, is sending a mission to Kosovo to ensure the supremacy of the law," Lavrov told reporters at a news briefing with Turkish Foreign Minister Ali Babacan. "To put it mildly, it is a bitter irony that this mission to ensure the supremacy of the law in Kosovo is being sent in breach of the highest international law," he said. "PANDORA'S BOX" Russia, a close Serbian ally, is seeking to flex its growing clout on the world stage but proved powerless to prevent Kosovo from announcing its split from Belgrade, despite blocking independence in the United Nations. Kosovo declared its independence on Sunday and the state was promptly recognised by most of Europe's largest nations and the United States, a move Russia says will open a "Pandora's Box" of separatist tension across Europe. The EU is expected to deploy the 2,000-strong mission by June. It will oversee training and institution-building, with limited rights to intervene to fight organised crime and corruption or hunt war criminals. President Vladimir Putin last week said the West was guilty of double standards in pushing for Kosovo's independence, a charge Lavrov repeated. The leader of Russia's Orthodox Church said on Wednesday that Kosovo's independence would sow disorder and could lead to separatist tension across the globe, RIA news agency reported. "It is an ... event which has unilaterally upset the balance in the world and could lead to very tragic events in a whole host of areas across the globe where separatist sentiments are warming up," Patriarch Alexiy II said. The United States and most European Union countries say Serbia relinquished the moral right to rule the people of Kosovo because of brutality under late President Slobodan Milosevic. But Serbs have vowed never to surrender Kosovo, which is dotted with Orthodox monasteries. Kosovo has been under United Nations supervision since 1999, when NATO bombing forced a withdrawal of Serb forces that had been attacking the province's ethnic Albanian majority.
