 Dhaka, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)A consignment of 42 artefacts sent to an exhibition at Guimet Museum in Paris on Nov 30 arrives back in Dhaka Saturday morning. The government will host an exhibition of the artefacts at home next week, officials with the cultural affairs ministry said. The officials said a special Air France cargo plane is scheduled to reach Zia International Airport around 5:30am Saturday, when customs officials will open the cartons and inspect contents in the presence of officials from the cultural affairs ministry, the foreign ministry, French Embassy and three officials returning from Paris with the consignment. The artefacts will then be sent to the National Museum amid tight security. Cultural affairs secretary Sharful Alam told bdnews24.com: "All preparations are complete to bring the artefacts back home. The authorities have been alerted to step up security in and around ZIA." Meanwhile, a high-profile committee led by cultural affairs adviser Rasheda K Choudhury has been formed to oversee the whole process and ensure safe return of the artefacts. The cultural affairs adviser, secretary and other officials will visit ZIA Friday night on the occasion. "Representatives of the National Museum, the Department of Archaeology and Barendra Museum will also be returning home on the same aircraft along with the consignment of artefacts," a ministry official said. The artefacts were put into cartons, crated and sealed officially at the airport in Paris on Feb 18-20 in the presence of the representatives who had been present there all along. The cultural affairs ministry officials said the safe dispatch of the consignment would cost around 33,000 euros, with Bangladesh contributing 9,000 euros. On security measures, the officials said two policemen would watch each crate of the cargo. Also, additional armed policemen and Ansars will be posted at the Cargo Village at the airport. Nurul Islam, ZIA security chief, told bdnews24.com: "All possible preparations have been put in place." On Dec 21, the second consignment of 145 archaeological relics packed in 13 cartons was ready for dispatch to Paris for display at the Guimet Museum. But a carton went missing from ZIA, prompting the government to stop the second consignment. bdnew
