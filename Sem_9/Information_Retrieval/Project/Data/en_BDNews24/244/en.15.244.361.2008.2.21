 LONDON, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An exiled former anti-corruption adviser urged Kenyans on Wednesday to tackle graft and push through land and constitutional reforms as part of a package to end a political standoff after disputed elections. Former United Nations chief Kofi Annan is mediating in talks between President Mwai Kibaki and the opposition aimed at ending a political crisis that sparked an explosion of ethnic violence in which more than 1,000 people have been killed.

The reforms he was calling for would not wait for a government of national unity but could be tackled now, he said. "I think it's all part of one big package," he said.
