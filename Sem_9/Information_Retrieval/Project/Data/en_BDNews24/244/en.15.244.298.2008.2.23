<TEXT>
 Washington, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A US B-2 stealth bomber crashed at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam just after taking off but the two pilots on board ejected safely, the US Air Force said late on Friday. "They have been evaluated by medical authorities and are in good condition," the Air Force said in a statement. An Air Force spokeswoman did not have details about bomber's mission in Guam. The aircraft, which cost almost $1.2 billion each, is based at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri. The B-2 bomber can evade most radar signals making it difficult for defensive systems to detect, track and attack. It has a range of 6,000 nautical miles (9,600 kilometers) without refueling, according to the Air Force. The B-2 bombers have been used for missions in Afghanistan, Iraq and Serbia.
