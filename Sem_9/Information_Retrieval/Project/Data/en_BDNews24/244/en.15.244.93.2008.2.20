 KATHMANDU, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nepali security forces shot dead a protester during demonstrations that have caused shortages of fuel and essential supplies and cast a shadow over upcoming elections, police said on Wednesday. Police opened fire late on Tuesday after anti-government protesters began throwing stones in Siraha, a town in the southern Terai plains bordering India that are home to half Nepal's population. "First we tried to control the mob by bursting tear gas shells and then fired shots in the air," said Prem Chettri, a police officer at the scene in Siraha. "But they were undeterred and tried to attack the police, forcing us to open fire." The United Nations said it was "extremely concerned about the use of live ammunition" and urged both sides to avoid violence. The protesters are demanding greater autonomy for the Terai and its ethnic Madheshi people, who have closer linguistic and cultural links with northern India than with Nepal's hill people. It is the second death since Madheshi groups called an indefinite strike and began blockading roads last week to demand greater power and government job allocations. Nepal imports all its fuel and many essential goods from India, and the blockade has choked supplies between the border and the capital Kathmandu. Dozens of protesters were also wounded in the latest violence and in other clashes with police elsewhere in the Terai. Some members of the police had shown restraint despite being pelted with stones by protesters, the Nepal office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a statement. But on other occasions "police used excessive force, sometimes against peaceful protesters, resulting in at least one death and numerous injuries". Some of injured people have been taken from hospital into police custody, the U.N. said. "It is essential that authorities observe international standards relating to the human rights of detainees," it said. The U.N. also noted numerous reports of attacks against journalists by both protesters and police. In the capital, long queues have formed outside the few petrol stations remaining open and food prices have risen. In the Terai, roads are largely empty of traffic, while schools and shops remain closed. The unrest has also raised doubts over the government's plans to hold a national election in April. The government and the protest leaders met on Tuesday but did not reach an agreement to end the trouble, both sides
