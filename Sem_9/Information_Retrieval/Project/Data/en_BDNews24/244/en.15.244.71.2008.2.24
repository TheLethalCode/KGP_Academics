The court also ordered Helal to pay a fine of Tk 50 lakh or suffer two additional years behind bars. Judge Tanzeena Ismail of the Special Judges' Court -6, which deals with graft cases, delivered the verdict. The court also sentenced Helal's wife Rupa Chowdhury to three years in jail for abetting her husband in accumulating the illegal wealth. Rupa was also fined Tk 50,000. Failure to pay, the court said, would result in an additional month in jail. The former lawmaker and his wife remain on the run and were sentenced in their absence.
