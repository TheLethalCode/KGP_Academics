<TEXT>
 MILAN, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A depleted Juventus missed the chance to go second in Serie A after a stoppage-time penalty gave lowly Reggina a 2-1 home win on Saturday. Nicola Amoruso converted the controversial spotkick after Mohamed Sissoko had caught the striker in the head attempting an overhead kick. Juve midfielder Cristiano Zanetti was dismissed for protesting after the final whistle. Forward Franco Brienza had put second bottom Reggina ahead when he latched on to Bruno Cirillo's mishit effort and slotted home on 32 minutes. Italy outcast Alessandro Del Piero equalised with his 11th goal of the league season when his long-range strike on 71 minutes squirmed under keeper Andrea Campagnolo, who otherwise had a good game. Third-placed Juve are a point behind AS Roma, who host fourth-placed Fiorentina on Sunday. Inter Milan, 11 points clear at the top, visit in-form Sampdoria. Claudio Ranieri's side felt hard done by after Pavel Nedved, Mauro Camoranesi and Sissoko, a January signing from Liverpool, had penalty appeals turned down. Juve believe a number of key refereeing decisions have gone against them this season. "If you have seen the whole match you can understand. We are just bitter. Three penalty episodes for us is only the tip of the iceberg," Ranieri told Sky. The club are back in the top flight after spending last season in Serie B having been found guilty of gaining favourable referees in a match-fixing scandal. Juve, who suffered their third league defeat, pressured in the second period but they lacked a cutting edge with strikers David Trezeguet and Vincenzo Iaquinta ruled out through illness and injury. Goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon was also rested. Earlier, Parma edged out of the relegation zone but threw away two points in a remarkable 4-4 draw at mid-table Torino. Home striker David Di Michele grabbed the equaliser eight minutes from time after Parma had been 4-1 up in the first half with Andrea Gasbarroni netting twice and Stefano Morrone smashing in a stunning volley from outside the box
