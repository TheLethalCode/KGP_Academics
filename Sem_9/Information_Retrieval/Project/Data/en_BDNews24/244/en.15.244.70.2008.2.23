 Dhaka, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com) -- Inspector-general of police Noor Mohammad said Saturday that the investigation into the August 21, 2004, grenade attack is taking "so long" to complete in order to avoid further controversy. "There has been a lot of controversy surrounding the investigation into the August 21 grenade attack," Noor told reporters following a sports prize giving ceremony at the Shaheed Police Memorial School and College in the city. "We do not want any more controversies. That is why the investigation is taking so long," he said. At least 23 people were killed in 2004 in a grenade attack on an Awami League rally in front of the party's office on Bangabandhu Avenue. The inspector-general remained vague on the possibility of taking action against police officers for negligence in the investigation. "There are cases where action could possibly be taken against senior police officials, so long as the allegations are proved," said Noor. On Feb 18, the IG said action would be taken against those responsible if any flaws were found in the grenade attack investigation, although he added that nothing would be done until the present investigation is complete. The initial stages of the investigation led to the arrest of one Joj Miah, whose confessional statement implicated Harkatul Jihad members in the attack. Much of the controversy of the case has centred on the validity of that confession, and subsequent police action. When Harkatul Jihad leader Mufti Hannan was later arrested, police claimed his confessional statement also implicated the Islamist group in the attack. The CID's investigation into the case is ongoing. Recently, 41 grenades were recovered in Satkhira on information received from another senior member of Harkatul Jihad, Abu Jandal. Rapid Action Battallion said the seized grenades were similar to those used in the 2004 attack. bdnews24.
