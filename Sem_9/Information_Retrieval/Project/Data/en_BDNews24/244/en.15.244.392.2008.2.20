 COLOMBO, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka have recalled spinner Rangana Herath and middle-order batsman Thilan Samaraweera for their two-match test series against West Indies starting in March. Herath, a 29-year-old left-arm spinner, played the last of his 12 tests in 2005 but his consistent performances in domestic cricket have enabled him to claim the second spinner's position ahead of Malinga Bandara. Samaraweera won his place back in the Sri Lanka top order for their two-test tour of Australia last November but was axed after two low scores in Brisbane. Fast bowler Ishara Amarasinghe, 29, has been rewarded for his impressive performances in the current triangular series in Australia with a place on his first test tour. Left-arm fast bowler Thilan Thushara, 26, has also been recalled. Thushara played a solitary test against West Indies in Jamaica in 2003. Fellow left-armer Chanaka Welegedera, currently touring in Australia with the one-day team, was left-out despite a promising test debut against England in December. Opener Malinda Warnapura, 26, replaces the out-of-form Upul Tharanga, who is one of four stand-by players along with Chamara Kapugedera, Sujeewa de Silva and Bandara. Fast bowler Dilhara Fernando, who underwent an ankle operation in early January, has been given more time to regain full fitness. The tour starts on March 17 with a practice game and includes two tests in Guyana and Trinidad before a three-match one-day international series finishing on April 15. Sri Lanka test squad - Mahela Jayawardene (Capt), Kumar Sangakkara, Michael Vandort, Malinda Warnapura, Chamara Silva, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Thilan Samaraweera, Prasanna Jayawardene, Chaminda Vaas, Muttiah Muralitharan, Lasith Malinga, Thilan Thushara, Ishara Amarasinghe, Rangana Herath, Farveez Maharoof
