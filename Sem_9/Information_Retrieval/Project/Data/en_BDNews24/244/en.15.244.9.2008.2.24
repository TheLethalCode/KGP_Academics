<TEXT>
 MINSK, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Belarus's most prominent detainee, Alexander Kozulin, whose release is demanded by Western countries, launched a hunger strike on Sunday to secure permission to attend his wife's funeral. Kozulin challenged President Alexander Lukashenko's re-election in 2006 but was jailed for 5 1/2 years after helping organise protests afterwards. His wife Irina, 48, died of cancer late on Saturday. The family's lawyer said her funeral was planned for Tuesday. "Alexander Kozulin has launched a hunger strike in connection with delays in granting him compassionate leave," family lawyer Igor Rynkevich told Reuters. "The family has told me that without Kozulin there will be no funeral." Kozulin, an academic, is one of two remaining detainees described as political prisoners by the West, which says they must be freed to improve ties with Lukashenko. The other is Andrei Kim, held over January protests by small businessmen. The president proposed Kozulin leave for Germany to secure treatment for his wife, but she rejected any suggestion she should leave the country to secure her husband's release. Kozulin was jailed after urging protesters at a rally denouncing the president's re-election to march to a prison where some activists were being held. He staged a 53-day hunger strike to draw attention to human rights complaints in Belarus. Rynkevich had earlier said that compassionate leave for Kozulin was set down in Belarussian law. "If the authorities refuse this or delay a decision, it would be not only an illegal act, but an inhuman and un-Christian act," he said. "There is not a single legal reason not to grant him leave." DECISION AWAITED Officials at the prison holding Kozulin made no comment. But a source close to the Belarussian government said: "Legislation in principle allows for this." Lukashenko, accused by Western countries of crushing freedom of expression and assembly, is barred from entering the European Union and United States on grounds of rigging the 2006 election. The president denies political overtones in convictions made by courts in Belarus, wedged between Russia and three EU members. But he declared the issue of detainees closed after Kozulin was offered the chance to take his wife abroad. After Lukashenko quarrelled last year with traditional ally Russia over energy prices, Belarus sought better ties with the West, which demanded in return an improved human rights record. Courts in Belarus have freed several opposition activists from prison in recent months, and Lukashenko has toned down criticism of the EU, which has cautiously praised Minsk's release of detainees and restraint during opposition ralli
