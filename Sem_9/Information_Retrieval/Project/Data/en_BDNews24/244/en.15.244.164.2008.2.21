<TEXT>
 LONDON, Feb 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's blue-chip FTSE 100 share index was almost 2 percent higher by mid-session on Thursday as miners rose and Reed Elsevier led a host of companies which issued results. At 1231 GMT the FTSE 100 index was up 1.9 points at 6,002.9 to extend earlier gains and punch through the psychological 6,000 barrier. Earlier in the day, stocks moved higher after data showed that UK retail sales shot up in January at four times the rate predicted by analysts. Anglo-Dutch publisher Reed topped the FTSE 100 leaderboard, adding 9.8 percent after it said it was acquiring U.S. risk-management business ChoicePoint for $4.1 billion including debt and also announced a renewed cost-savings drive as well as the planned sale of an advertising-dependent information business. In negative waters, energy firm Centrica fell 2.1 percent despite reporting a 40 percent increase in year profit as traders said the numbers were in line with expectations. The shares briefly rose in early trade but reversed gains after Chief Executive Sam Laidlaw said share buybacks were not a priority. He added that its British Gas business seemed to be holding onto its customers despite a 15 percent hike in gas and electricity charges last month. Mining stocks were the standout positive sector, however, accounting for 30 index points. Traders said M&A activity and record metal prices driven by buoyant economic sentiment was assisting the shares, with Xstrata, Kazakhmys, Anglo American and Lonmin all around 5 percent higher. "We've had a lot of good news today on the reporting front (and) good retail sales," Mark Priest, a trader at TradIndex said. "We've had nothing but doom and gloom -- no one spending money, everyone worried about the credit crunch ... Recession ... and this helps pave the way to stopping that." "We've been given the worst case scenario and we seem to have moved slightly away from that. Yesterday there was a lot volatility in the Dow ... but at least they remained positive on the day." Banks also rose on the improving economic outlook with Royal Bank of Scotland up 4.3 percent, HBOS 3.2 percent higher and Lloyds TSB climbing 2.9 percent. The latter is also due to release its preliminary final earnings on Friday. But Alliance & Leicester was hit by a series of broker downgrades after it suffered a double blow from the impact of financial market turmoil on Wednesday, warning of sharply higher funding costs and revealing a big writedown on the value of risky assets. The stock dipped 3.1 percent to extend on its 8.4 percent fall in the previous session. SABMILLER SAYS NO Among other decliners, Scottish & Newcastle slipped 2.6 percent to reverse gains achieved in the previous session, after its global rival SABMiller said late on Wednesday that it had decided against a bid for the British brewer. Shares in SABMiller climbed 3 percent. But Britain's third-biggest drugmaker Shire added 2.9 percent after it beat forecasts with a 38 percent rise in underlying 2007 earnings and was confident about prospects for its biggest new drug hope, Vyvanse for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Kingfisher, Europe's biggest home-improvements retailer, was 2.3 percent up after it said lower fourth-quarter sales at its UK market leader B&Q had been partly offset by a strong performance in France and Poland. "It's a good day to come out with good results," said Howard Wheeldon, senior strategist at BGC Partners. "Good results are always what the market needs. The trouble is it doesn't always get the
