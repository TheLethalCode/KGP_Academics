<TITLE> "Shame on you", Clinton tells Obama </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Cincinnati, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hillary Clinton slammed rival Barack Obama on Saturday for campaign leaflets on her health-care plan that she called "blatantly false" and accused him of using Republican tactics in their contest for the Democratic US presidential nomination. In a bitter exchange, the Obama campaign defended the leaflet as accurate and decried Clinton's "negative campaign." "Shame on you, Barack Obama," Clinton said, speaking to reporters after a rally in Ohio, a state that is key to her struggling campaign. Brandishing a copy of the leaflet, Clinton said the Obama campaign was spreading "false, misleading, discredited information" about her health-care plan. "Senator Obama knows it is not true that my plan forces people to buy insurance even if they can't afford it," Clinton said. "It is blatantly false and yet he continues to spend millions of dollars perpetuating falsehoods. It is not hopeful. It is destructive, particularly for a Democrat to be discrediting universal health care." Obama spokesman Bill Burton in a statement responded, "Everything in those mailers is completely accurate, unlike the discredited attacks from Hillary Clinton's negative campaign that have been rejected in South Carolina, Wisconsin, and across America." MARCH 4 CONTESTS Clinton, a New York senator and former first lady, would be the first woman US president if she won the general election, and Obama, an Illinois senator, would be the first black U.S. president. Obama has won 10 consecutive state nominating contests since Feb. 5. The string of victories has put him ahead in the race for delegates to a nominating convention this summer where the party will pick a candidate for the November election. Many analysts say Clinton must win contests in the delegate-rich states of Ohio and Texas on March 4 to cut Obama's lead and still have a chance at the nomination. Campaigning in Ohio, Obama told a roundtable on health care at a hospital in Columbus that his health care plan would cut medical costs more than Clinton's and that hers would force people to buy health insurance. The Illinois senator touched on the issue that Clinton had complained about when he said they both are seeking universal health care. "The main difference between us is that Senator Clinton includes a mandate, which means she'd have the government force you to buy health insurance, and she said that she'd consider 'going after your wages' if you don't," Obama said, adding that he disagreed with that approach. TRADE VIEWS Meanwhile, Clinton said the campaign leaflet on health care reminded her of health insurance industry attacks on her plan. She also said another leaflet Obama's campaign issued misrepresented her views on trade agreements such as NAFTA. "Let's have a real campaign. Enough with the speeches and big rallies and then using tactics that are right out of Karl Rove's play book," she said, referring to the Republican political strategist behind George W. Bush's winning presidential campaigns. Clinton said Obama's proposal to fix problems of health insurance availability would leave 15 million Americans out, while hers would be universal. "I'm not going to give up on it (universal care) the way Senator Obama has given up on it," she said. At the earlier rally Clinton had trained her fire on Bush to try to undermine Obama's message of change. Clinton said Bush, who campaigned on a platform of "compassionate conservatism," also had promised Americans change. "He promised change, didn't he?" she said of Bush. "The American people got shafted and we're going to have to make up for it." When the new president starts the job next year, Clinton said there would be a lot of work waiting on the desk in the Oval Office: "Let's imagine a folder ... on the front of that folder it says something like George Bush's mess," she said. "That's going to be a big folder."
