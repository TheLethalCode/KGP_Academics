 Ansar Hossain bdnews24.com Correspondent Cox's Bazar, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com) A record-breaking number of tourists descended on Cox's Bazar over the three-day Ekushey break. Hotel owners in the celebrated vacation spot said they had been fully booked for up to a month in advance of this year's February 21 vacation. General secretary of Cox's Bazar guest house owners' association Abul Kashem Sikder told bdnews24.com Saturday that hotels and guest houses in the resort town could accommodate around 50,000 guests in total. Sikder estimated that around 3 lakh tourists had arrived in the beach resort over the previous two days, although other locals put the figure as high as 5 lakh. Surat Alam, who rents out sun-loungers on the beach, said: "We have never seen so many tourists at the same time. Over 1,000 buses, as well as hundreds of private cars arrived in the last two days." Chhamiron Begum, a holiday maker from Dhaka, said her family chose to come to Cox's Bazar almost every winter. However, her son Abdul Karim claimed that the hotel owners were taking undue advantage of the rush by demanding exorbitant room rates. Managing director of Hotel Seagull, Masum Iqbal, said hoteliers demand a premium on special occasions because the resort town does not enjoy year-round business. Many younger tourists spent the night of Feb 21 outdoors due to the influx of visitors. Muhib-bin-Malik, who arrived in Cox's Bazar with around 50 friends from Comilla, said: "We didn't know hotels had to be reserved in advance, so now we will have to spend the night on the beach." Assistant superintendent of Sadar Circle police, MM Salauddin, said they had deployed additional plainclothes police to deal with the huge tourist numbers this year. bdnews24.c
