<TEXT>
 SINGAPORE, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Soccer news in brief from around the world: AC Milan striker Ronaldo is recovering well after knee surgery, according to one of his doctors at a Paris hospital. "He is recovering well and there is no sign of inflamation," Yves Catonne told French sports daily L'Equipe on Wednesday. The Brazilian had an operation on a ruptured left knee tendon last week. "I don't think he wants to quit. I felt he was decided to work and motivated to go on. Even though his return will be a real challenge, because he won't be able to play for eight or nine months." Former Algeria coach Ali Fergani has departed USM Algiers after the club's home defeat in the Arab Champions League this week, the club said. Fergani, who has had two spells as coach of Algeria's national team and also played for the country at the 1982 World Cup finals, quit after a 1-0 loss to Egypt's Al Gaish in a second round group match on Monday. The United Arab Emirates' top referee has refused to take charge of next month's World Cup qualifier between China and Australia because he is upset at not being nominated to work at the 2010 finals. Eissa Darwish, who refereed at the 2006 World Cup, said he retired and will not work again after being overlooked by the UAE for a role in the 2010 tournament. Chinese Super League (CSL) Shandong Luneng have entered into a partnership with Charlton Athletic, which will involve the English team touring China in the next three years, the club said on its Web site (www.charlton-athletic.co.uk). Shandong, domestic double winners in 2006, loaned playmaker and national team captain Zheng Zhi to Charlton last season and made the deal permanent after the London side were relegated from the English Premier League. China and Thailand will play each other in a warm-up match in Kumning on March 15 to prepare for the next round of 2010 World Cup qualifiers, Thai media reported on Wednesday. China, second in Group One, play Australia at home and Group Two bottom side Thailand face Oman in Bangkok on March 26
