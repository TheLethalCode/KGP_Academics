 NICOSIA, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Greek Cypriots voted on Sunday to choose between a communist and right-wing candidate in a tight presidential race crucial to fresh peace talks on the war-divided island and to Turkey's EU accession hopes. Half a million Greek Cypriots choose between Communist party leader Demetris Christofias, 62, and Ioannis Kassoulides, 59. Both have pledged to try to break a deadlock in reunification talks with estranged Turkish Cypriots but differ on the process. "What is at stake here is nothing short of a settlement," said James Ker-Lindsay, a Cyprus analyst at Kingston College in London. The conflict is a festering wound in relations between NATO allies Greece and Turkey. Ankara's European Union talks have been partly suspended because of the stalemate on Cyprus and there will be a new review in 2009. Negotiations froze under President Tassos Papadopoulos, who had rejected a U.N. peace blueprint in 2004. His surprise elimination in the first round of voting Feb. 17, raised hopes of ending the conflict. His party is backing Christofias, who has secured more political support than his rival, and would make history as the island's first communist president if elected. "I extend a message of friendship to Turkish Cypriots, to reunite our country and to be masters of our own fate, without foreign interference," Christofias said after casting his vote in the capital Nicosia. DIFFERENT APPROACH Christofias favours a more structured approach to fresh talks through the United Nations, while Kassoulides said he will contact Turkish Cypriots directly if elected. "I voted for Christofias because ... he will help resolve the Cyprus issue, he has good relations with Turkish Cypriots," said Nicosia housewife Yiota Georgiou, 43. Christofias says he will not tamper with the island's free market economy. His AKEL party may still boast busts of Lenin and red flags at its headquarters but it also owns a number of large lucrative businesses on the island. Kassoulides, a former foreign minister backed by the right wing camp, has tried to project a pro-European image. "People will decide whether to move forward, through Europe, and focus on ridding ourselves of the (Turkish) invasion and occupation," he said after voting at a Nicosia school. Cyprus has been split since 1974 between the Greek-Cypriot south, seat of the EU-recognised government, and the Turkish-Cypriot north, which is recognised only by Turkey. It was divided when Turkey invaded the north after a brief coup inspired by the military then ruling Greece. Although his party had initially tilted in favour of the UN plan in 2004, Soviet-educated Christofias backed Papadopoulos's rejection of it. Kassoulides and his own right-wing Democratic Rally had been in favour of the plan drafted during their term in power, as had Turkish Cypriots. "I voted for Kassoulides because our country needs a change," said teacher Cleopatra Pentari, 35. "I hope that talks start and a solution is found with Kassoulides." Polls opened at 0500 GMT and close at 1500 GMT, with final results expected by 1730 G
