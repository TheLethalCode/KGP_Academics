 BRUSSELS, Feb 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States said on Thursday it looked forward to working with a new Pakistani government with Pervez Musharraf as civilian president, despite indications that election winners might seek to force him out. Speaking during a visit to Brussels, US Assistant Secretary of State Richard Boucher said that Pakistan had made a successful democratic transition and made clear Washington would prefer to see Musharraf stay in place. "We look forward to working with whoever emerges as prime minister, we look forward to working with President Musharraf in his new role," Boucher told a news conference. The leaders of the two parties that came out on top in Pakistan's election on Monday were to meet on Thursday to discuss forming a coalition that could force Musharraf out. Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister Musharraf overthrew in a 1999 military coup and whose party came second in the election, goes into the coalition talks having made clear he would like to drive the president from power. The Pakistan People's Party (PPP) of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, who was assassinated on Dec. 27, emerged as the main victor in the poll. It says it will be up to parliament to decide which president it could work with. President George W. Bush on Wednesday called the Pakistani elections a victory for the people, and said he hoped the newly elected officials would be friends of the United States. White House spokeswoman Dana Perino told reporters travelling with Bush to Liberia that the president had telephoned Musharraf on Tuesday on flight from Rwanda to Ghana. She gave no further details of what the two men discussed. NO SPECULATION Asked whether the United States would persuade Musharraf to step down if the opposition were to demand that, Boucher said: "Let us not speculate at this point. Let's let them get together, form a government, decide what their programme is and we look forward to working with them." Asked about concerns for Musharraf's future given his status as a key U.S. ally in the battle against Islamist militancy, Boucher said: "Pakistan has been a key us ally with Musharraf as the leader. Pakistan will remain a key us ally with Musharraf and the prime minister and others as leaders." However, when asked if Washington could envisage working with a government that did not have Musharraf at its head, Boucher said: "We can envisage working with a Pakistani government that is duly constituted... We have said all along we look forward to working with whoever emerges from the election." In an interview with the Wall Street Journal published on Wednesday, Musharraf said he was not ready to resign. Boucher said Washington's aim had been to help Pakistan make a successful democratic transition, and added: "We have achieved that goal." He said Musharraf had already changed from being a military president to civilian one. It was now up to Pakistanis to work out the division of powers between president and prime minister. "We are pretty much bystanders in that process," he said. Boucher said Washington expected the new Pakistani government would maintain a positive momentum in the key relationship with Afghanistan seen under Musharraf. More 50,000 foreign troops led by NATO and the US military are in Afghanistan battling Islamist militants who have found refuge in lawless
