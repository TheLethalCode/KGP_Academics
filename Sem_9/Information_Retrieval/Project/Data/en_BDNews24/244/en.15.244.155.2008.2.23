 Rangpur, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com)- Former president and Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad Saturday called for the formation of a national government immediately with acceptable leaders from all political partiesexcept Jamaat-e-Islamito rid the nation of, what he called the "prevailing crisis". He said that the present caretaker government would have to take steps in this regard. Exchanging views with reporters at his Rangpur residence, Ershad said: "In the present situation there is no alternative to formation of a national government." "The country has plunged into a new sort of crisis," he said, adding that in such a situation formation of a national government comprising representatives of different political parties would solve the problems. The JP chairman lauded the Election Commission for holding dialogues with the political parties, but urged the commission not to invite Jamaat leaders Nizami, Mujahid and others accused of war crimes for talks. He added: "They could be tried under the existing laws of the land. No new law is necessary for this." In opposition to calls for withdrawal of the state of emergency, Ershad said: "We do not want to go back to pre-1/11 situation." "Earlier, there were elections during martial law." "We want an election free of black money and muscle power. I hope in the next election honest and efficient persons will get elected. There is no problem if the election is deferred for this purpose." He said that he did not think it mandatory to hold elections by December. According to him, time is required for holding an acceptable election. "We do not want plunderers in the parliament. The persons arrested on charges of corruption against whom there is specific allegations should be tried." "If the corrupt people are not tried and punished the country will go back to the pre-1/11 situation," Ershad said. "The corrupt people will again occupy the parliament by getting elected using black money and muscle power. It will again create anarchy in the country. The people do not want to see such anarchic situation again." On the grand alliance, he said: "We were in the grand alliance. We will take decision through discussion after political activities resume." Asked whether he would again form an alliance with BNP and Jamaat Ershad said: "The question of forming an alliance with Jamaat does not arise at all." bdnews
