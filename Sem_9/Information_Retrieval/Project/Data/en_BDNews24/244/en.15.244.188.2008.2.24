<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh collapsed spectacularly in the second innings to set South Africa to chase 205 to win the first Test at Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium Sunday. Jacques Kallis took five batsmen as Bangladesh having resumed the day on 125 for four sank to 182 all out in the second innings just before the lunch on the third day. Bangladesh lost three quick wickets in four runs in the morning to be reduced to 155 for seven and never recovered, being just 10 runs short of their first innings total before getting bundled out in the second innings. Kallis made the day's first breakthrough for the visitors having overnight batsman Junaed Siddique caught behind keeper Mark Boucher, before Aftab was trapped lbw by Dale Steyn offering no shot, leaving the side at 148 for six. Junaed added only 10 runs to his overnight 64 to finish 74 off 184, which included six fours, while Aftab played a patient 81-ball 24. They together added 63 runs for the fifth wicket after Bangladesh were reduced to 85 for four on the second day. After the departure of both overnight batsmen, Kallis took little time to clean up as he sent back Mushfiqur Rahim (2), Mohammad Rafique (14) and Mashrafee Bin Mortaza (11) and Shakib Al Hasan (3) in a row. Bangladesh took a 22 run lead in the first innings after bowling South Africa out for 170. Bangladesh made 192 all out in their first innings. bd
