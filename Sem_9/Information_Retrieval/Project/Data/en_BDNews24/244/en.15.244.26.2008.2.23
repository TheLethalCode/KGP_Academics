<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com)Gano Forum president Kamal Hossain said Saturday that dialogues should not only take place between the government and political parties. The government should also hold dialogues with all groups for a meaningful change in the country, barring what he termed "evil forces" including war criminals. At a discussion titled "National Unity in the context of Glorious Ekushey" at the Gano Forum offices Saturday afternoon, he said that before sitting in dialogue with the government the party would hold discussions with people from different classes and professions starting Sunday. "People's democracy must be brought back, and not a feudal democracy." "A meaningful change has to be brought to the country in the spirit of Ekushey," Kamal Hossain said. "We do not want an election for election's sake. We want a fair election. The parliament has to be comprised of honest people elected on the basis of people's power." He said that the heirs of the defeated forces of 1952 and 1971 were still conspiring and urged people to remain alert about them. "The future of the country depends on healthy politics. Let us all unite for that. If the people are united victory is inevitable." "The united force of the people were victorious in 1952, 1954, 1971 and 1990." bdnew
