<TITLE> European shares fall 1.3%; banks, oils weigh </TITLE>

 LONDON, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares fell more than 1 percent by midday on Wednesday, led by banks and oil stocks as investors fretted over more writedowns in the financial sector and crude futures came off record highs. At 1200 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 1.3 percent at 1,320.22 points, tracking falls in the United States and Japan. US shares were expected to open lower on Wednesday, adding to the cycle of losses. The heavily-weighted banking sector was the biggest drag on the index, with HSBC down 1.7 percent, Royal Bank of Scotland down 1.6 percent and Societe Generale down 2.5 percent. British bank Alliance & Leicester shed 10 percent after it warned of sharply higher funding costs and took a 185-million pound ($360.4 million) writedown on risky assets. BNP Paribas, France's biggest listed bank, took an 898-million-euro writedown during the fourth quarter but its earnings compared favourably with other banks hit by the credit crisis, and its stock was relatively unscathed, falling 1.1 percent. Analysts said there was little good news going around. "Oil near $100 is worrying people about inflation, especially about its impact on consumers that can dampen spending," said BNP Paribas strategist Edmund Shing. "Two defensive sectors that you would expect to do well are falling: telecoms on the price war worries and foods and beverages on commodity price inflation," he added. "We're still waiting to see what will happen to the bond insurers in the United States, and economies are weakening in Europe and the US so we are waiting for some good news." Adding to the misery for the banking sector were comments from Juergen Ruettgers, the premier of the German state of North-Rhine Westphalia, who said the country's regional state-backed landesbanks were in crisis. The region is home to stricken state-owned bank WestLB. Among other individual stocks heavyweight telecoms group Vodafone slid 3.6 percent after US joint venture Verizon Wireless said it had started offering flat-rate plans for unlimited calls, raising fears of a price war. Dutch brewer Heineken NV reported 2007 net profit in line with its guidance but its shares fell 6.5 percent -- making it among the biggest percentage losers on the index, as the company flagged input price rises. European credit derivative indexes hit new all-time peaks as fears of the bank writedowns, unwinding of structured credit products and the gloomy economic outlook hit sentiment, which analysts believe will also undermine equities. BUCKING THE TREND Barclays gained 0.7 percent as investors switched into the stock from Alliance & Leicester. Dutch financial services group ING rose 2.1 percent after taking a lower-than-expected impairment charge of 194 million euros on its riskier investments in its fourth-quarter results. The FTSEurofirst 300 got off to a torrid start to 2008, falling 12 percent last month, but it has had a better February, with a fall of less than 1 percent so far. The index has owed much of its recovery to US rate cuts that lopped 125 basis points off the Fed funds rate in two tranches in January. But analysts said oil at near record levels could dissuade central banks from cutting further. "There is now a discussion that people are starting to have about whether inflation issues are starting to be a constraint on further Fed (Federal Reserve) easing," said Darren Winder, equity strategist at Cazenove. Investors are watching inflation data due from the United States at 1330 GMT for clues about what path central banks could take. There was some respite from the oil price rise as crude fell 1.3 percent to $98.75 a barrel. But this made oil stocks the worst performers, with Total, BP and Royal Dutch Shell losing 1.5-2 percent. Around Europe, Britain's FTSE 100, Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 were trading 1.3-1.5 percent low
