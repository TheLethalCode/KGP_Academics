 MELBOURNE, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tight bowling helped Australia beat Sri Lanka by 24 runs under the Duckworth-Lewis system in their rain-hit triangular series one-day international on Friday. The defeat all but ended Sri Lanka's chances of making the finals. With six points from six matches, they must win both their remaining games, and hope India lose theirs, to make the finals against Australia, who have 22 points. The Sri Lankan bowlers had given their side a chance of victory at the Melbourne Cricket Ground by restricting the world champions to 184 for seven off 50 overs, with Mike Hussey (64 not out) and Michael Clarke (50) providing the backbone of the total. Australia's bowlers, however, proved to be just as effective on the slow pitch, restricting Sri Lanka to just 77 for four in the 30th over when rain drove the players from the field. "It was a difficult wicket, it was just very slow ... when we started the game, there was a little bit of moisture in the surface," Australia captain Ricky Ponting told reporters. "Even though our total looked quite small, 184, we felt that if we got a couple of early wickets ... we felt we'd have a good chance to apply some pressure through the middle of their innings. We did a really good job of doing that." Australia's bowlers began strongly with Stuart Clark having Sanath Jayasuriya caught behind for a golden duck, before he had Dilruwan Perera adjudged leg before by Rudi Koertzen on the first ball of his next over. Kumar Sangakkara and captain Mahela Jayawardene attempted to resurrect the innings from three for two, though Jayawardene was caught behind by Adam Gilchrist for 27 off Nathan Bracken to leave his side in deep trouble at 42 for three. Sangakkara was then dismissed for 22 with the score on 64 when he mistimed a pull shot off a James Hopes short ball and was easily caught by Andrew Symonds in the covers. Chamara Silva (16) and Tillakaratne Dilshan (nine) were the not out batsmen when the game was abandoned after the players had been off the field for almost 90 minutes. "We've made it quite difficult for ourselves over the whole tournament -- our bowlers have done a great job right throughout but our batting has never clicked and let us down badly," said Sangakkara. That Australia had a total to defend at all was courtesy of Clarke and Hussey, who rescued their side's innings with a 90-run partnership after they had slumped to 54-4 in the 22nd over. Sri Lanka pace bowler Farveez Maharoof had been the pick of their attack, bowling his 10 overs unchanged to finish with 2-20. Australia next play India in Sydney on Sunday, while Sri Lanka play India in Hobart next Tuesday. The final match before the finals will be between Australia and Sri Lanka on Feb. 29 in Melbourn
