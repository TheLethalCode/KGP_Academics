<TEXT>
 Warsaw, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Poland will propose Lech Walesa, leader of the Solidarity movement that led to the fall of communism, to join the EU's Reflection Group looking at the 27-nation bloc's future, a source said. EU leaders want to appoint a group of "wise men" to look at the long-term future of the European Union. The group is to focus on Europe in 2020-2030, mostly on the economic challenges of globalisation. The panel will also look at issues such as energy, climate change and justice matters. It is due to report its findings to EU leaders in June 2010. "Walesa will be our candidate for the Reflection Group," a source close to the government told Reuters. Walesa, former president of Poland who worked as a shipyard electrician in Gdansk, is a symbol of the overthrow of communism in Eastern Europe in 1989 and a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. "I think that Lech Walesa has a great chance. I know that there are positive reactions to his possible candidacy from many sides," said Krzysztof Lisek, head of the parliament's foreign policy committee. The European Union will likely decide on who will be part of the group in the second half of the year. Walesa was not immediately available for comment. The group is led by former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzales. Former Latvian president Vaira Vike-Freiberga and Jorma Ollila, chairman of mobile phone giant Nokia, have been named as the two vice-chairs of the panel. The group is to consist of nine members in total.
