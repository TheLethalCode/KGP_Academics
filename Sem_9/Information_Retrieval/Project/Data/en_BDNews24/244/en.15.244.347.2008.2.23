<TEXT>
 Cizre, Turkey, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkish troops pressed their offensive against Kurdish PKK guerrillas in northern Iraq on Saturday, two days after crossing the mountainous border in a campaign Turkey's allies hope will be short and limited. Iraq's government has called on Turkey to respect its sovereignty and to avoid any military action which would threaten security. A Turkish security source told Reuters operations were expected to intensify on Saturday. "We understand completely the size of the threat Turkey faces, but military operations will not solve the PKK crisis," Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh told a news conference. Washington is sharing intelligence with NATO ally Turkey on PKK movements in Iraq. It has urged Ankara to limit the operation to precise rebel targets and bring it to a swift conclusion. In a statement late on Friday, Turkey's military General Staff said five of its troops and at least 44 rebels had been killed in Iraq since the campaign began late on Thursday. "Intelligence we have received suggests the so-called leaders (of the rebels inside Iraq) are in a panic and trying to flee the region by moving rapidly to the south," it said. There have been conflicting reports about the scale of Turkey's military operation. A senior Turkish military source told Reuters two brigades made up of around 8,000 troops are taking part, though Iraqi officials and a senior officer with coalition forces in Baghdad suggested the number was no more than a "few hundred". The military is anxious to avoid possible clashes with Iraqi Kurdish security forces and said the PKK was the sole target of the Turkish offensive. "Our troops are fighting heroically in difficult weather conditions and difficult terrain. The operation will end once our targets have been reached," it said. On the Turkish side of the border, near the town of Cizre, military personnel patrolled remote hillside roads beneath the snow-capped mountains leading into Iraq. Military helicopters flew overhead and armoured personnel vehicles trundled along the roads between the numerous army bases which dot the border region. REGIONAL STABILITY Turkey says it has the right under international law to hit the PKK in Iraq where it estimates some 3,000 rebels are based. Turkey's military has been bombing PKK positions in northern Iraq since securing parliament's authorisation to carry out cross-border operations in October. Ankara blames the PKK for the deaths of nearly 40,000 people since it began its armed struggle in 1984. Washington and the EU, like Turkey, brand the PKK as terrorists and international reaction to the latest offensive has been muted. But the United States and the European Union fear a prolonged military campaign inside Iraq would raise the risk of serious clashes between Turkish and Iraqi Kurdish forces and also undermine the fragile US-backed government in Baghdad. Turkey's General Staff has not specified the size or length of the surprise operation, though one Turkish television channel has said it will last about 15 days. Turkey's government and military have come under domestic pressure to crush the PKK after a series of deadly attacks on their troops late last year. Baghdad, which has little sway over autonomous northern Iraq, has urged a diplomatic solution to the PKK presence. Turkey launched several major land offensives in the 1990s into northern Iraq against the separatist movement and has since kept small contingents of troops at bases there
