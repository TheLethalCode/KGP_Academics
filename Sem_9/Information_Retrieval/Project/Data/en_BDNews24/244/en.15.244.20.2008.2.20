 RAMALLAH, West Bank, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Palestinians should declare an independent state unilaterally if peace talks with Israel continue to falter, a top aide to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said on Wednesday. It was not immediately clear if Abbas shared the view of Yasser Abed Rabbo, but Saeb Erekat, another senior Palestinian negotiator, voiced opposition to any unilateral declaration of independence. Abed Rabbo, a member of the Palestinian negotiating team, made his comments a day after the latest round of top-level talks with Israel and amid criticism the Jewish state was not doing enough to secure a statehood agreement within a year. "If things are not going in the direction of actually halting settlement activities, if things are not going in the direction of continuous and serious negotiations, then we should take the step and announce our independence unilaterally," Abed Rabbo told Reuters. Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert met on Tuesday to accelerate US-backed peace talks launched at a conference in Annapolis, Maryland, in November, the first formal negotiations in seven years. The talks, which Washington hopes will yield an agreement on Palestinian statehood this year, have been stalled by disputes over Israeli plans to build new homes on occupied land near Jerusalem and Olmert's insistence on putting off talks on the fate of the holy city. In a move that could further anger Palestinians, Israeli anti-settlement group Peace Now said on Wednesday right-wing activists had placed 27 caravans in the West Bank despite a pledge by Olmert at Annapolis to halt settlement activity. Peace Now said activists were circumventing a ban on new settlement construction by putting the caravans on site near the Eli settlement north of the West Bank town of Ramallah. "Olmert talked about a settlement freeze at Annapolis but it's all blah blah because we see construction all over the West Bank," said Hagit Ofran, head of monitoring at Peace Now. Olmert and Abbas agreed at Annapolis to abide by a 2003 U.S. peace "road map" which requires Israel to halt settlement activity and the Palestinians to rein in militants. Both sides accuse the other of failing to meet those commitments. A spokesman at Israel's military-run Civil Administration department, which oversees the West Bank, could not be reached for comment. "KOSOVO NO BETTER THAN US" Abed Rabbo drew an analogy between the Palestinians and Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia on Sunday. "Kosovo is not better than us. We deserve independence even before Kosovo, and we ask for the backing of the United States and the European Union for our independence," Abed Rabbo said. But Erekat said the Palestine Liberation Organisation had already declared independence in 1988. "Now we need real independence, not a declaration. We need real independence by ending the occupation. We are not Kosovo. We are under Israeli occupation and for independence we need to acquire independence," Erekat said. Abed Rabbo was the first senior Palestinian negotiator to discuss declaring independence unilaterally since a Palestinian uprising erupted in 2000. He accused Israel of buying time to bolster Jewish settlements around Jerusalem and continue building a barrier in the occupied West Bank, cautioning that Palestinians could be left with a "fragmented stat
