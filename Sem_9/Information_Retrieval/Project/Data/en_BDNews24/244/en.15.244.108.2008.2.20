 TEHRAN, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran's determination to continue its disputed nuclear work has brought major powers "to their knees", the Iranian president said on Wednesday ahead a report this week by the UN nuclear watchdog. In a typically defiant speech as the International Atomic Energy Agency prepares to issue its report, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Iran would not heed calls by major powers to halt the sensitive nuclear work that has led to two rounds of U.N. sanctions. "The Iranian nation will not allow any power to trample even on its smallest (national) right," he said in a televised address to a rally in the southern Iranian port city of Bandar Abbas. The IAEA report is expected to be released on Friday. IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei has said the agency has made "good progress" in resolving outstanding issues. U.N. Security Council members are expected to scrutinise the details in his report before finalising any new sanctions text, which is now being considered. "The Iranian nation's will to continue nuclear work has won over the will of big powers ... (and) brought them to their knees," the Iranian president said. "Today the agency, which is legally in charge of this case, has prepared a report and announced that Iran's activities are legal and there is no diversion," he said. The IAEA has been seeking answers to long-standing questions about Iran's programme, closing some of its files, under a deal with Iran reached last year. The United States is leading efforts to impose more sanctions in Iran for refusing to halt uranium enrichment, the part of Iran's programme that most worries the West because it has both civilian and military uses. Iran insists its work is entirely peaceful and has refused to halt the work. The final word in nuclear policy lies with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, under Iran's system of clerical rule, but the leader has also said Iran will not stop the nuclear program
