 Gaza, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Three Palestinians were killed by an Israeli missile strike near the northern Gaza Strip town of Beit Hanoun on Saturday, medical and Hamas officials said. A senior medical official said the three civilians killed were all employees of a Jordanian bank operating in the Hamas-controlled territory. An Israeli army spokesman confirmed Israel had conducted a missile strike in the area and said the target was a group of militants who were preparing to launch mortar bombs into Israel. Israel frequently carries out missile strikes and raids against militants in the Gaza Strip in what it says is an effort to stop them launching rockets into southern Israeli towns.
