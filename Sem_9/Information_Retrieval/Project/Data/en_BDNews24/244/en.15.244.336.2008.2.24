 Dhaka, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com) -- National Awami Party president Mozaffar Ahmed said Sunday an immediate announcement of the election schedule will go some way to removing doubts surrounding a free and fair national election. Mozaffar briefed reporters following a meeting between the Awami League and NAP ahead of the second round of reforms talks with the Election Commission. The NAP president said his party is part of the 14-party alliance, and their demands would be more effective if they were made collectively. "There are doubts surrounding the possibility of a free and fair election. All agencies and people involved in the election process must ensure a free and fair election," Mozaffar said. The NAP chief added, however, that even with an announced election schedule some doubts will remain until the election has actually been completed. Awami League presidium member Tofail Ahmed told reporters after the two-party meeting that the AL's dialogue would be based on the reform proposals put to the EC and the caretaker administration by AL president Sheikh Hasina on July 15, 2005. "We will also demand the exclusion of all anti-Liberation War forces and extremists from registering as political parties," Tofail said. bdnews
