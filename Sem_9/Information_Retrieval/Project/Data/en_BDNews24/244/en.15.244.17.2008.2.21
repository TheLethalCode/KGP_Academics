 WASHINGTON, Feb 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States said on Wednesday it expected more countries would recognize Kosovo in the coming weeks as Russia predicted a negative chain reaction from restive regions such as northern Cyprus and Abkhazia. The United States and Russia are at loggerheads over Kosovo, the majority Albanian territory that declared independence from close Moscow ally Serbia last weekend. Western countries like the United States, France, Britain, and Germany have recognized Kosovo, but others worried about their own separatist movements, such as Canada and Spain, have not. "I think this process is going to take time," senior State Department official Rosemary DiCarlo said in an interview with Reuters. "We anticipate that in the next few weeks that we will see further recognitions and support for Kosovo's new status." Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, on a visit to Washington, anticipated a negative trend with separatist regions one after another pushing for their own independence. "Unfortunately, even now, we have some first signs of a chain reaction. If you look at the statements coming from the Palestinian administration that 'we don't have to continue our negotiations, let's set a time limit and then just declare our independence,'" Peskov said. Earlier on Wednesday, an aide to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Yasser Abed Rabbo, drew an analogy between Kosovo and the Palestinians, saying Palestinians should declare independence unilaterally if peace talks with Israel continue to falter. "Isn't it damaging for the Middle East peace process? It is," Peskov said at the Nixon Center. "Is it contributing to a regional stability and prosperity on the Caucasus? No, to the contrary," he said, referring to Abkhazia and South Ossetia, separatist regions in the former Soviet republic of Georgia. "We hear cheers of joy coming from northern Cyprus," the breakaway Turkish region, he added. "We hear cheers of joy coming from the Basque organizations (in Spain), coming from different regions in Europe and this will only grow ... adding very serious problems." U.S. officials insist Kosovo's situation is unique. Washington and most European Union countries say Serbia lost the moral right to rule Kosovo because of the brutality it used there under the late President Slobodan Milosevic. HOPE FOR MIDDLE EAST SETTLEMENT Asked about comparisons of the Palestinians' situation with Kosovo, State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the Bush administration believed there was still hope for the Middle East peace process. "We believe there is still the possibility of a negotiated settlement. The situation in Kosovo had run its course, in terms of trying to find a solution, a negotiated diplomatic solution," he said. DiCarlo noted that Kosovo already had a draft constitution that would be debated publicly soon, and was adopting laws that would implement the plan for supervised independence developed by UN envoy Maarti Ahtisaari. The plan includes protections for the province's remaining 120,000 Serbs. "As it (Kosovo) moves more and more in this direction, we think that more countries will look favorably on recognition," DiCarlo said. While the United States would not pressure any other country to recognize Kosovo, "we obviously would like to see the countries that share our values support a new state," she sa
