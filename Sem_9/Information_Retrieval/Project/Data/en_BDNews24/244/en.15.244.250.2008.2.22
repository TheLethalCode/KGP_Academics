<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh emerged Group D champions in the ICC U/19 World Cup with a nerve-wracking 13 runs win over England in their last group match in Kuala Lumpur Friday. Bangladesh face South Africa in their quarterfinal clash Sunday. Chasing 150 runs to win, England batsmen faced a tough challenge from Bangladesh bowers and fielders that caused them to fold at 136 in 47.4 overs. It was not easy for English cricketers to play the Bangladeshi spinners, who together picked up five wickets giving away just 66 runs in 30.4 overs. Despite losing the first four wickets at 69 in 17.4 overs, England seemed to be on course before spinner Mahmudul Hasan struck to break the 44-run partnership uprooting Redfern's (26) stumps, leaving England at 113/5. Then, skipper Suhrawardi Shuvo removed Westley (21) in the next over while Dawson (4) was run out by Nasir Hossain, who had last batsman Lee (1) to wrap the England innings. It was a sweet revenge of Bangladesh's loss to England in the quarterfinals in the last edition's meet in Sri Lanka. Nasir and Mahmudul returned two wickets each while Shuvo, Rubel Hossain and Shubhashis Roy took one each. Earlier, put in to bat first, Bangladesh faced a fierce spell from pacer James Harris, who damaged Bangladesh's innings claiming five for 29. The Junior Tigers were reduced to 49 for seven inside 14 overs before Shuvo played a captain-knock 56 not out. Shuvo added 81 runs for the eight wicket with Dollar Mahmud, who gave a return catch to Chris Woakes for a 77-ball 36. The Bangladesh skipper hammered four fours in his patient 100-ball knock before Bangladesh lost last two wickets at 149 with both Rubel (6) and Subhashis (0) getting run out by Billy Godleman. bd
