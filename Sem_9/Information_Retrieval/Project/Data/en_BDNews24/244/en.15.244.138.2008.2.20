 SINGAPORE, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks fell more than 2 percent on Wednesday as a jump in oil above $100 a barrel rekindled fears that soaring commodity prices will limit what central banks can do to prop up a slowing global economy. European shares were also set for a weak start, with financial bookmakers expecting falls of 0.5 to 1 percent in markets in London, Frankfurt and Paris. Financial stocks led declines in Asia, with losses accelerating on news that the listed affiliate of private equity group Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co had again delayed repaying billions of dollars in debt. "With the uncertainty about credit markets still hanging around, news like this does spook markets," said Paul Xiradis, chief executive officer at Australian fund Ausbil Dexia. The spike in oil was fuelled by expectations that OPEC will not raise output next month. That poses a problem for the Federal Reserve and other central banks fighting the credit crunch and falling consumer sentiment. "A surge in commodity prices, especially oil prices, is heightening concerns that inflation would pick up at the same time the global economy is slowing down," said Kim Joon-kie, an analyst at SK Securities in South Korea. "That could pose a burden to many central banks around the world considering cutting interest rates to prevent an economic slowdown." Lower interest rates generally make stocks more attractive compared to other assets and reduce companies' borrowing costs. Japan's Nikkei average ended down 3.3 percent, while MSCI's index of other Asian stocks was down 2.3 percent at 0640 GMT. COMMODITY SAFE HAVEN? The MSCI Asia index has fallen more than 10 percent so far this year and is 20 percent off its peak in early November. In contrast, the Reuters-Jefferies CRB index, which measures a basket of commodities including metals, crops and energy, jumped to an all-time high on Tuesday and is now up more than 10 percent this year. Platinum, wheat, soybeans and gold have all hit record peaks in recent weeks. While some investors question whether demand for commodities can hold up in the event of a sharp or prolonged fall in global economic growth, others argue they represent a good inflation hedge and a strong momentum play. Shanghai copper rose 1 percent after London futures hit a four-month peak, although platinum retreated from Tuesday's 14th straight record high. Strong demand from China pushed soybean and soyoil to records in Chicago trade, while gold dipped to around $925 an ounce, having hit a record high of $936.50 on Feb. 1. Crude retreated to $99.30 after the previous session's 5 percent jump. The threat of rising prices and the risk it poses for monetary policy initially rattled government bonds, but prices recovered as Asian equity markets extended declines. Japanese 10-year government bond futures rose more than half a point after touching a one-month low in early trade. DOLLAR STEADIES Currency markets largely shrugged off commodity and stock moves, with the dollar steadying after falls the previous session. Markets are waiting for data on U.S. inflation and housing later on Wednesday as well as minutes from the Fed's January meeting for clues on the interest rate outlook. The dollar traded around 107.90 yen, recovering from a slide to around 107.20 yen on Tuesday. The euro was little changed around $1.4720, while inching up against the yen to 158.85 yen. Among Asian stock markets, Shanghai was up 0.3 percent, but others including Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Australia all dipped 0.1 to 0.6 percent. Energy stocks fared well, with Japanese oil explorer Inpex Holdings up 1.8 percent and Australian oil and gas producer Woodside Petroleum gaining more than 4 percent after raising its reserves estimat
