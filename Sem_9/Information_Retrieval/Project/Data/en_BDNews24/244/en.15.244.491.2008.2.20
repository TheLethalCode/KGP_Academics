 Cape Canavera, Fla., Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US space shuttle Atlantis landed safely at its home port in Florida on Wednesday, clearing the way for an attempt by the US military to shoot down a dead spy satellite. Atlantis landed at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 9:07 a.m. EST (1407 GMT), ending a successful mission to deliver and attach Europe's first permanent space laboratory to the International Space Station. The U.S. space agency had staffed its backup landing site in California to ensure it would be able to end its first shuttle flight of the year on Wednesday, allowing the military to go ahead and shoot the ailing spy satellite out of space. The military has said it will fire a ship-based missile at the satellite, which died shortly after a 2006 launch, because it is carrying toxic rocket fuel that could endanger populated areas if it re-entered the atmosphere without human intervention to guide it into the ocean. The satellite is lower than the space station, which orbits 200 miles (320 km) above Earth, and therefore not a danger to it. The planned satellite shootdown stole some of the limelight from the shuttle's 13-day mission in which it finally ferried the European laboratory Columbus to the International Space Station. The delivery of the $1.9 billion lab was years behind schedule because of problems including the 2003 destruction of the shuttle Columbia, and its installation prompted cheers from jubilant European Space Agency officials. As NASA brought Atlantis home, the first section of Japan's three-part Kibo science laboratory was being tucked inside the shuttle Endeavour for delivery to the space station next month. The launch is scheduled for March 11.
