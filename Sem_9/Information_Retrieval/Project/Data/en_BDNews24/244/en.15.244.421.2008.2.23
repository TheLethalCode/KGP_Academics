 Dhaka, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com)  Opener Junaed Siddique struck his second Test fifty after Shahadat Hossain's six-wicket haul as Bangladesh took an overall 147-run lead against South Africa at the close of the second day of the first Test Saturday. Bangladesh were 125 for four at stumps in the second innings with Junaed and Aftab Ahmed remaining unbeaten on 64 and 13 at Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Junaed and Mohammad Ashraful produced a fine resistance after pacer Dale Steyn caused the damage by removing top order Tamim Iqbal (2), Shahriar Nafees (16) and Habibul Bashar (2) in a row to reduce the hosts to 29 for three. They put on 56 runs together for the fourth wicket before the Bangladesh skipper edged behind keeper Mark Boucher off Makhaya Ntini for 24 off 52 balls, leaving the side at 85 for four. Junaned, who reached his half-century hitting Ntini for two, hammered five fours in his patient 158-ball knock. Earlier, South Africa ended their first innings with 170 all out, 22 runs short of Bangladesh's first innings total of 192, as Shahdat produced his best of 6 for 29 to eclipse his previous 5 for 86 against Sri Lanka in Bogra in 2006. Bangladesh took the lead in the first innings for the sixth time in their Test history, three times at home and as many times away. After the lunch break, the 21-year old pacer uprooted Ntini's stumps to wrap up South Africa's first innings before trapping Mark Boucher leg before for 11. Just before the lunch break, Shahadat struck a double blow to reduce South Africa to 158 for eight, having Morne Morkel caught out by Mushfiqur for a five-ball one and removing Johan Botha for 25. Ashraful broke the 68-run sixth wicket partnership between Botha and AB de Villiers removing the latter in his first delivery of the day. Steve Bucknor gave a controversial out to Villiers, who got a thick edge while trying to pull on an Ashraful double bounce delivery. Villiers, believing it was a dead ball, stayed at the crease until Bucknor raised his fingers. Villiers, who was dropped on 30 by Ashraful off Mohammad Rafique, and survived a bold appeal for lbw from Rafique in the next delivery, scored 46 off 73 balls hitting seven fours and one six. After having resumed the day on 76 for four, South Africa lost an indecisive Prince in the day's second over to be reduced to 77 for five. Prince was unable to make up his mind after driving Shahadat at cover, and keeper Mushfiqur Rahim did not hesitate to whip off the bails from a throw by Shakib Al Hasan. South Africa added 94 losing remaining wickets on the day to finish at 170 all out, allowing the hosts to a 22-run lead. bd
