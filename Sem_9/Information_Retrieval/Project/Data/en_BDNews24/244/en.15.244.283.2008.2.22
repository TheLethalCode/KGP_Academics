<TITLE> Biman decides aircraft purchase by March 15 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)Biman Bangladesh Airlines is to decide by March 15 the purchase of four aircraft from the US aircraft giant Boeing as an Airbus offer did not comparatively seem profitable to Bangladesh, a senior Biman official said Friday. The Boeing offer remains valid until March 15. Airbus was interested more in leasing than selling aircraft, the official said. On the other hand, the Boeing proposal included the option of leasing aircraft to Biman until it delivered the planes ordered, which certainly looked more reasonable and affordable to Biman, the official said. "The Boeing proposal is more acceptable than the other. Besides, the operating cost for Boeing-787s is far lower than that for other similar aircraft," Shah-e-Alam, representative of Bangladesh Airline Pilots Association (BAPA), told bdnews24.com. "Boeing has offered to supply aircraft in 2011 while Airbus said it would deliver the planes not before 2013." Biman managing director MA Momen told bdnews24.com: "The Boeing proposal will lose its validity after March 15. The authorities, therefore, must decide about the purchase before that date." Asked about Biman's preference as regards the two proposals, Momen said, "We are treating both proposals with due priority. We'll raise both Boeing and Airbus proposals at the Biman board meeting. It's finally up to the board of directors to decide on the purchase weighing all pros and cons." "It'll be difficult for Biman to stay in business if it doesn't add new aircraft to its dwindling fleet." Shah-e-Alam said that on November 28 last year, a Boeing delegation, invited by Biman, visited Bangladesh and proposed to sell eight aircraft, when Biman agreed to buy four. He said that the eight aircraft Boeing offered to sellnew and oldwere from the 787 and 777 fleets, and everybody knew that Boeing-787s were rather economic aircraft to operate. Boeing said that it could deliver the aircraft by 2011 if Biman responded to the current offer. Alam added that Airbus representatives visited Bangladesh on Feb 5 and proposed to sell four brand-new wide-bodied A-330 aircraft to Biman Bangladesh Airlines, which they would be able to supply by 2013. He said that Airbus also proposed to give Biman smaller A-320 aircraft on lease. If Biman agreed, Airbus would, in phases, replace Biman's four A-310s. Earlier in 1998, Airbus proposed to sell aircraft to Biman, when Biman had no plan of buying new planes. In 2007, Biman floated international tender for lease purchase of four widebodied planes. In the absence of any satisfactory response, it decided to approach aircraft manufacturing companies directly. Biman's plan included buying new aircraft with bank loan and selling the old ones in phases. As a Biman official said, Biman's four DC-10s, three Airbus planes and three F-28s are at least 15 to 25 years old and have become almost inoperative as they suffer frequent mechanical failure. bdnews24.co
