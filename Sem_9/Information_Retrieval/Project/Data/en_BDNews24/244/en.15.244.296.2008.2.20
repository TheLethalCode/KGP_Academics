 Mustak Ahmed bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com)The education ministry has suspended all appointments at Jahangirnagar University amid allegations of irregularities in recruitment, officials and teachers said Wednesday. The ministry issued the suspension order on Feb 18, which would remain in force until further notice. Also, the university authorities have been directed to send in three days the list of all teachers, officials and employees appointed to JU since June 2006. The ministry also suspended two recruitment notices which were published on Jan 9 and Jan 22, 2007 seeking job applications for eight departments of the university. Allegations surfaced over appointments at different levels during the rule of the four-party coalition. Against the backdrop of the allegations, the ministry issued an order in June 2006 to stop all appointments at the university. Despite the order, JU authorities continued their recruitment process. The two appointment notices, issued on Jan 9 and Jan 22, were the latest. A JU teacher, asking not to be named, told bdnews24.com that his department had also received a copy of the ministry's suspension notice. The teacher said the university had responded to the notice Tuesday, but did not turn in the list of the teachers yet. bdnews
