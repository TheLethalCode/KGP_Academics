<TITLE> Pakistan's winners propose anti-Musharraf coalition </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ISLAMABAD, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The party of Pakistan's assassinated former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto began stitching together a coalition on Wednesday that could topple President Pervez Musharraf, after winning most seats in a general election. The United States welcomed the vote as "a step toward the full restoration of democracy", but urged the next government of the nuclear-armed country to work with Musharraf. Musharraf, a key Muslim ally for the United States in its fight against al Qaeda, also oversaw better ties with rival India, but neighbours and allies now fear Pakistan is becoming more unstable and economic gains could be squandered. Pakistani stocks edged to a life-high in early trade, as investors registered relief that the vote was less violent and fairer than feared, saying it was a first step towards stability. A wave of sympathy helped Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party (PPP) win the most seats in the National Assembly in Monday's election, in which the allies of former army chief Musharraf, who seized power in a 1999 coup, suffered big losses. But the PPP needs coalition partners and the president's camp is banking on persuading it to invite the pro-Musharraf Pakistan Muslim League (PML) to salvage his leadership. Bhutto's widower Asif Ali Zardari, who took over as PPP leader after she was killed in December, appeared to take that lifeline away by saying his party would not invite anyone from the PML into a broad-based coalition it planned to form. Zardari told the BBC's Urdu-language service on Tuesday that Musharraf had said he would quit if he no longer had the people's support, and vowed that the PPP would put the issue of the president's future before parliament. "The entire nation is reminding, the mandate is reminding," Zardari said. "Now we will take it to the parliament and we will see who supports us." DIVIDING LINE The PPP wants Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister Musharraf overthrew in 1999, to join the coalition along with an ethnic Pashtun party that kicked Islamist parties out of power in the North West Frontier Province where militants operate. "The dividing line is whether you were with the dictatorship or whether you were with those forces who were struggling for democracy," senior PPP member Taj Haider told Dawn Television. Sharif, whose party ran a close second in Monday's poll, has made driving Musharraf from power his mission since returning from exile in Saudi Arabia in November, a month after Bhutto. According to unofficial results for 261 seats, the PPP, Sharif's party and the Awami National Party (ANP) held a shade under the two-thirds they need to change the constitution or bring Musharraf down, but independents could join their banner. "This is an excellent result for moderate forces. It's a return to a proper civilian government with political forces who have a proper mandate," said Kamal Jabbar, a lawyer in Karachi. Analysts warned ideological differences and past bad blood could still scupper an alliance between the PPP and Sharif, in which case, the PPP's door could re-open to Musharraf's friends. The president's emissaries made little headway when they met Zardari late on Tuesday, according to officials. Political paralysis has played havoc with management of the economy in the last six months. Pakistanis have struggles with soaring fuel prices, shortages of basic foods and gas, and worsening power cuts, while investors in stocks fear further political upheavals could puncture a booming stock market. But the Karachi Stock Exchange main index has bucked a bearish trend across Asia to recover all losses suffered after Bhutto's murder. A 40 percent gain in 2007 made it one of Asia's best performers, and it has gained about 900 percent since 2000. The rupee gained nearly 1 percent against the dollar in the last two days, having been bumping 6-year lows. MUSHARRAF'S CHOICES Musharraf's popularity has largely disintegrated over the past year, especially after he imposed a stint of emergency rule in November, purging the judiciary and gagging the media. Zardari and Sharif are due to meet on Thursday. Negotiations could last for days. But, if they agree, it would leave Musharraf with two choices, said analysts. He could either quit or drag out political upheavals with a hostile parliament that would try to oust him on grounds he violated the constitution when he imposed emergency rule. "He has the graceful option and the confrontational option," said Ijaz Shafi Gilani, chairman of pollsters Gallup Pakistan. "My sixth sense is that he will leave." In Washington, State Department spokesman Tom Casey said the US administration hoped "whoever winds up in charge of the new government would be able to work with (Musharraf)". White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said the United States was counting on Pakistan to remain an ally in counter-terrori
