 KARACHI, Feb 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan have invited India to play a three-match one-day series next month. The invitation was sent after the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) agreed to reduce Australia's scheduled tour in March and April by two weeks because of the security concerns of Ricky Ponting's team. "We have formally sent a proposal to the Indians to play the short series in mid-March before the Australians come to Pakistan on March 29," a PCB official who declined to be identified told Reuters on Thursday. "The Indian board have assured us they will look at our proposal and try their best to squeeze in the series despite their team's hectic schedule in this period." The PCB said India could play all the games in Lahore, starting from March 12, in order to complete the tour in one week. India will end their participation in the tri-series in Australia on March 7 if they qualify for the finals. They then play hosts to South Africa from late March. Australia will send a delegation to Pakistan early next month to assess the security situation following this week's peaceful general election. PCB chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf told Geo television that Australia had still not confirmed the tour. "They were reluctant to even send their delegation but after the election was held peacefully they changed their mind and the tour is now a real possibility," said Ashra
