 Dhaka, Feb 21 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh want a starting point for Test improvement when they take on visiting South Africa in the two Test series opener at Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium Friday. "We haven't had good results in Test cricket and we would like to start off the Test improvement by playing Friday's match," said Bangladesh captain Mohammad Ashraful at a pre-match press briefing in Mirpur Thursday. "We all are trying to improve our performances though we didn't play good cricket after the World Cup in the West Indies. We also failed to put up our potential performance in New Zealand, Sri Lanka and against India at home. "This time we hope to put up a good show against South Africa specially after having recently played a tough series against New Zealand," said the Bangladesh captain. Bangladesh won just one Test, lost 45 and drew five in 51 matches they had played since 2000. Besides, Bangladesh conceded four innings defeats in all four Tests they had played against the South Africa. Ashraful is worried over their poor batting display in the first innings. "We cannot make a good start in the first innings as we failed to do so in the last five Tests though we had scored 250 plus in the second innings. If we get off to a fine start like in the second innings, then this match is certainly to be a longer one," said the top-order batsman. Despite the feeble performance in Test matches, the 23-year old batsman gets the confidence to do better this time by seeing the Bangladesh Cricket Board XI's encouraging performance against South Africa in warm-up three-dayer. "Five to six cricketers, who performed better in the warm-up three-dayer, are also in the national squad. So we can expect a better Test result than the warm-up drawn match," said Ashraful. "We can also expect a Test win, if the batsmen can do their job accordingly," said the youngest Test centurion. Coach Jamie Siddons, however, warns his boys that South Africa are not going to be an easy opponent. "South Africa are a better Test playing team compared to New Zealand and it is not going to be easy (for us)," said the Australian. "The batsmen showed little more application than what I wanted to see in the practice match from our batsmen, and I am happy to see their improvement," said Siddons. South African captain Graeme Smith also thinks they have to work hard in five days to win the Test in the subcontinent conditions. "I think few of the bowlers (South African) have put me under pressure already. Look, what we are expecting in the subcontinent, wicket doesn't look pretty good here. We will have a lot of hard work in five days." "We have learnt quite a lot from the warm-up game. Obviously we have got good confidence having won in Pakistan. It's not so long ago. "But again, it's going to be a unique challenge here. And I think respect on the Bangladesh team is a key... I think it is a great challenge winning in the subcontinent," said Smith, who is going to touch the captaincy record of late Hansie Cronje. Cronje led the South Africa in the highest 53 Tests. "I have never dreamt of becoming South Africa's leading Test captain. Certainly it is a great honor and wonderful achievement, I am proud of it," said Smith. The Bangladesh team management kept pacer Sajedul Islam and middle order batsman Rajin Saleh out of the 14-man Test squad. Its learnt opener Tamim Iqbal plays the match subject to his fitness, to be tested before the match. Otherwise, Shahriar Nafees will come in for Tamim. If all things are right, Habibul Bashar is going to be the first Bangladeshi cricketer to play 50 Tests.
