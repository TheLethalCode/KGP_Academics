 London, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil retreated on Wednesday, a day after hitting a record high above $100 a barrel, as investors focused on a US report expected to show crude stockpiles rose for a sixth week. US crude stocks were expected to rise by 2.3 million barrels. The Energy Information Administration report will be released on Thursday, a day later than usual, due to Monday's holiday. Oil slid $1.19 to $98.82 a barrel by 1435 GMT, having risen nearly 5 percent, or $4.51, to a record peak of $100.10 on Tuesday. London Brent crude fell $1.45 to $97.11. "It's a bit of a correction after the strong rally yesterday," said Christopher Bellew, senior vice president at Bache Commodities. "It looks like it's going to be a downward day today." The latest peak for U.S. crude was 1 cent above the previous record high of $100.09 reached on Jan. 3. Strength in gas oil limited the decline for crude because of a tight market in Europe and cold weather, dealers said. The March gas oil contract was up $3.25 at $882.50 a tonne. Concern that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will hold or even cut output when it meets on March 5, as well as uncertainty about Venezuelan and Nigerian supplies, sent prices back to triple digits. Libya's top oil official said on Tuesday that the group would find it hard to lower supply because of rising prices. News that Nigerian oil delta rebel leader Henry Okah had been shot dead, later debunked by a government spokesman, U.S. refinery problems and the row between Venezuela and Exxon Mobil also lifted prices. Oil's gain came in tandem with record highs for platinum and soybeans as commodities remained in favour among investors seeking to beat returns in other markets, such as equities. "The rally may be less indicative of narrowly defined energy fundamentals than of fund capital's quest for safe havens and financial hedges against inflation," said Antoine Halff, deputy head of research at brokers Newedge.
