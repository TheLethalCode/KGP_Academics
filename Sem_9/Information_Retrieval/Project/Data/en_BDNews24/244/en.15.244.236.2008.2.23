<TITLE> No new gas supply for Chittagong firms: M Tamim </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com)  Special assistant to the chief adviser M Tamim told businessmen in Chittagong Saturday that the government will not give permission to set up new industries such as fertiliser factories and power plants due to shortage of gas. At a discussion meeting with local administrators and businessmen in Chittagong, he advised using coal, instead of gas, to generate power. Businessmen had said earlier in the meeting that setting up of industries remained frozen due to shortage of gas. Tamim said gas would be supplied in phases to the firms that have approval for gas connections. But no new connections would be permitted. He said the country would require up to 4,700 megawatts electricity over the summer and the government was trying to produce up to 4,000 megawatts. The chief adviser's special assistant came down hard on previous governments for the situation. "The scenario could have been different if previous governments had undertaken long-term planning in this regard," he said. Asked whether foreign investment would not be hindered in this regard, Tamim said it might have adverse effects but there was no alternative. The present administration was thinking of importing gas from Myanmar, he said. "The plans are at the initial stage. Gas might be imported on the condition that fertiliser would be given to Myanmar in return." The special assistant also told the meeting that the government has taken initiatives for production at the Semutang gas field in Manikchhari, Khagrachhari, to boost gas supply in Chittagong. Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration and Production Company Ltd, or BAPEX, was asked to start the process of digging wells in the field, he added. After the meeting, Tamim told reporters that the government was thinking of hiking CNG prices in proportion to petrol and octane. bdnews
