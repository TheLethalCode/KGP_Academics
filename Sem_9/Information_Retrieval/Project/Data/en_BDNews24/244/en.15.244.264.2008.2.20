 CAPE TOWN, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa will accelerate exchange control reforms and implement a system of prudential regulation, while opening up participation on the rand futures market, Finance Minister Trevor Manuel said on Wednesday. "Exchange controls on institutional investors will be removed and replaced with a system of prudential regulation, involving quarterly reporting and monitoring of foreign exposures by the Reserve Bank," Manuel said in his 2008 budget speech to parliament.

The latest relaxation continues the government policy of gradually lifting controls. "The importance of a sound framework for financial stability has been underscored by the present turbulence in financial markets, and the direction of our reform is focussed on replacing unnecessary administrative controls with improved surveillance and prudential limits on foreign exposure risks," Manuel said. In a bid to encourage local companies, trusts and banks to manage their foreign exposure, they will be permitted to participate without restriction in the rand futures market on the JSE Securities Exchange.
