<TITLE> Big German parties face test as Hamburg votes </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BERLIN, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germans in the northern city-state of Hamburg voted on Sunday in an election expected to keep Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives in power but give a bigger boost to a new far-left party. The first exit polls from Germany's second-largest city after Berlin are due to be published at 6 p.m. (1700 GMT). At 10 a.m. 21 percent of Hamburg's 1.2 million eligible voters had cast their ballots, up slightly from the last election in 2004. Polls show Ole von Beust, a member of Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) who has ruled Hamburg since 2001, will lose his absolute majority in parliament but retain power by forming a coalition, possibly with the environmentalist Greens. That partnership would be a first at state level and, if successful, could persuade Merkel to try a similar tie-up at the national level when she seeks re-election in 2009. She now heads an uneasy "grand coalition" with the Social Democrats (SPD), who have dominated the left in the post-World War Two era. Hamburg is a city of contrasts -- home to some of the wealthiest Germans as well as a large number of immigrants and blue-collar labourers, who work in Europe's second biggest port and the city's large Airbus factory. The centre-left SPD, which ran the city for over four decades before von Beust wrested control from them seven years ago, has vowed to heal the "social split" it says has developed under the CDU premier between Hamburg's rich and poor. But it is fighting off a left-flank assault from the Left party, a new grouping of ex-communists and SPD deserters, which did surprisingly well in state votes in Hesse and Lower Saxony last month and may do even better in Hamburg. The Left, which seeks a generous new minimum wage and curbs on managers' salaries, has risen in the polls since it emerged this month that hundreds of rich Germans may have evaded taxes by hiding cash in secret accounts in Liechtenstein. The party's rise has injected new uncertainty into the German political process by forcing the country's big parties, the CDU and SPD, to consider ties with new coalition partners in the run-up to the next federal vote in 2009. "The two big players in Berlin seem to be going in circles around themselves at the moment," said Jackson Janes, director of the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies. "And they will watch what is happening around the country as they try to figure out how to prepare for next year." The SPD's national leadership will be watching the Hamburg result closely for signs of how its supporters view "Red-Red" cooperation with the Left party. Chairman Kurt Beck has set off a storm of protest within his own party by suggesting the SPD break a taboo and use Left party votes to seize power in Hesse after a deadlocked vote there in January. Many moderate SPD voters see the Left as dangerous populists and could desert the party in Hamburg as a result. "The Red-Red debate will determine the Hamburg election," read the front-page headline in Sunday's Die Welt newspaper. For a Factbox on the Hamburg election click
