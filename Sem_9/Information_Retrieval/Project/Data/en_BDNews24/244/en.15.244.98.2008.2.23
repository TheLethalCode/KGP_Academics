 Asadabad, Afghanistan, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A roadside bomb killed six Afghan security employees of a construction firm on Saturday in the eastern province of Kunar, an official said. The blast happened on a road in Sarkano district which lies to the south of Asadabad, the provincial capital of Kunar near the border with Pakistan. "They were travelling in a car when the blast went off," the official said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast, part of the worst spell of rising violence in Afghanistan in the past two years, the bloodiest period since U.S.-led troops removed the Taliban's government in 2001. But Taliban militants largely rely on roadside bombs and suicide attacks in their campaign against the foreign troops, the Afghan government, aid groups and anyone supporting Kabul. More than 11,000 people have been killed since 2006 alone in Afghanistan. Several Western politicians have recently warned that the Central Asian country may slide back into anarchy if the worsening of the security situation is not controlled.
