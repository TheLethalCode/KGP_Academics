<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com) General Moeen U Ahmed said Wednesday that Bangladesh should have its "own brand of democracy". Speaking at the unveiling of his Nirbachito Sangkolon, a compilation of selected essays, at Kurmitola Golf Club, the army chief said: "We should have such democracy which is applicable to us in Bangladesh." "I have termed it 'own brand of democracy'." "We have tried to practise Westminster-type parliamentary democracy for the last 15 years," Moeen said. "In such democracies, the prime minister is equal to other ministers. But what happened here? Everything was with the prime minister." "If we follow this kind of democracy, it is not true Westminster-type democracy," the army chief said. "If we compare our situation with theirs, we will see their education, society and trainingeverything is different." The army chief added: "Vote buying never takes place there. Here we see large-scale vote buying." "The other day I visited Sharankhola upazila (in Bagerhat). Local people told me that no leader ever appears there. They only come once every five years to seek vote." "We should establish such democracy which is suitable for us." The 248-page bookpriced at Tk 275contains an array of Moeen's speeches and interviews on topical issues facing Bangladesh and beyond. The book published by Asia Publications gives insights into the army chief's thoughts on politics and democracy with occasional flashbacks to the history of Bangladesh. The book ends with a gallery of 16 pictures on Moeen's life and work. While launching the book, the chairman of Transparency International Bangladesh trustee board, Prof Mozaffer Ahmad said that the army chief had played the role of a spokesman for the Armed Forces in highlighting their roles at a "critical juncture" of the nation. "This will make history and remain as a document if the people ever wanted to evaluate the work of the Armed Forces," Ahmad added. bdnews24.
