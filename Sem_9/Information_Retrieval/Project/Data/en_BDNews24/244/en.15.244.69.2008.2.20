 LONDON, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's top share index fell 1.1 percent early on Wednesday as inflation fears weighed, and lender Alliance & Leicester added to the gloom by warning on margins. At 0828 GMT, the FTSE 100 was down 65.2 points at 5,901.7 points, after advancing 3.1 percent in the past two sessions. "The market continues to be very nervous indeed, still concerned about the financial sector," said Henk Potts, equity strategist at Barclays Stockbrokers. "Clearly the environment in which some of the mortgage banks are operating has deteriorated," he said. "We are still some way off getting through the turmoil. Until that comes, we will tend to have these volatile sessions." Banks were the worst hit, followed by miners. Alliance & Leicester plunged nearly 14 percent after Britain's seventh-largest listed bank said its 2007 profit tumbled 30 percent as it suffered a $360.4 million writedown on its exposure to risky assets. Barclays, Lloyds TSB, HBOS, HSBC, Standard Chartered and Bradford & Bingley all lost between 0.7 and 3.5 percent. Crude prices retreated but hovered above $99 a barrel after climbing nearly 5 percent to a record above $100 a day ago. Higher commodity prices typically fuel fears that the resulting higher inflation will limit the scope of major central banks to cut rates to avert an economic slowdown, triggered by a global credit market turmoil. Bank of England policymaker Kate Barker said the danger of a sharp economic slowdown in Britain was more worrying than rising inflation, but the case for an immediate interest rate cut was not compelling. The BoE is due to publish minutes of its Feb. 6-7 meeting when it cut rates by 25 basis points to 5.25 percent. Investors will also keep an eye on how the U.S. is coping with inflation when consumer prices data is released at 1330 GMT. The market was also troubled by news that KKR Financial Holdings had deferred repayment of debt due on Feb. 15. The listed affiliate of private equity group Kohlberg Kravis Roberts said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that the maturity date on the debt had been extended to March 3. Oil shares rose, with the exception of BP, which this session traded without the rights to its coming dividend. Also in the commodity sector, miners languished as metal prices eased and after Anglo American posted a 6 percent rise in full-year profit, in line with forecasts, and said a global credit crisis would delay the disposal of its road surface business Tarmac. Anglo American shed 2.4 percent, while BHP Billiton, Xstrata , Kazakhmys, Vedanta Resources Rio Tinto and Lonmin dropped between 0.8 and 2.4 percent. Rio Tinto also traded without dividend rights. Rexam added 1.9 percent after the world's biggest maker of drinks cans said it met forecasts with a 7 percent fall in underlying annual profit and it expected to return to profit growth in 2008. Drugmaker Shire advanced 3.1 percent ahead of its results on Thursday. Carnival and Scottish & Southern Energy fell after going ex-divide
