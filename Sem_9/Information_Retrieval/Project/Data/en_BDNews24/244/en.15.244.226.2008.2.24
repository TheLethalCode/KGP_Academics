<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com)  South Africa were just 27 runs shy of their target at the close of the third day of the first Test after Bangladesh collapsed dramatically to set the visitors to chase 205 to win at Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium Sunday. The Proteas were 178 for four at stumps with Ashwell Prince (24) and AB de Villiers (8) resuming the fourth day Monday. South Africa were chasing their record number of runs in the subcontinent to win a Test after they made a draw against Sri Lanka in 2003, chasing 203 to win. Shahadat Hossain and Mohammad Rafique took two wickets each, but their efforts were not enough to stop the Proteas, whose captain Graeme Smith and Hashim Amla struck 62 and 42 respectively to put themselves on their way to the target. Shahadat, who claimed six for 27 in the innings, first removed Neil McKenzie (26) and Kallis (7) while Rafique dismissed Smith and Amla to return 49 for two, remaining two wickets shy of his 100th Test wicket. Smith put on 52 runs with McKenzie, and added another 73 with Amla to leave the field keeping the visitors almost out of danger. Earlier, Jacques Kallis took five wickets for 30 as Bangladesh having resumed the day on 125 for four sank to 182 all out in the second innings just before the lunch on the third day. Bangladesh lost three quick wickets in four runs in the morning to be reduced to 155 for seven and never recovered, being just 10 runs short of their first innings total before getting bundled out in the second innings. Kallis made the day's first breakthrough for the visitors having overnight batsman Junaed Siddique caught behind keeper Mark Boucher, before Aftab was trapped lbw by Dale Steyn offering no shot, leaving the side at 148 for six. Junaed added only 10 runs to his overnight 64 to finish 74 off 184, which included six fours, while Aftab played a patient 81-ball 24. They together added 63 runs for the fifth wicket after Bangladesh were reduced to 85 for four on the second day. After the departure of both overnight batsmen, Kallis took little time to clean up as he sent back Mushfiqur Rahim (2), Mohammad Rafique (14) and Mashrafee Bin Mortaza (11) and Shakib Al Hasan (3) in a row. Meanwhile Boucher reclaimed his wicketkeeping world record from Adam Gilchrist when he caught Mushfiqur Rahim for his 417th dismissal. Bangladesh took a 22 run lead in the first innings after bowling South Africa out for 170. Bangladesh made 192 all out in their first innings. bdne
