 Jamalpur, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com)The wages of rural workers employed in improvement and maintenance of roads and infrastructure have been increased to Tk 90 from Tk 54, adviser Anwarul Iqbal said Saturday. "The government this year allocated Tk 53 crore for the purpose," the local government, rural development and cooperatives adviser said at a discussion meeting in Jamalpur. The adviser added that several measures were being taken to increase rural employment opportunities. Anwarul also told Saturday's meeting that the government will do away with those municipalities that in the past were created for political reasons,. "Many municipalities have been formed only on political grounds," "The government is formulating laws regarding municipalities, of which many will be scrapped once the law is enacted." On steps to assist farmers, the adviser said the government was in the process of setting up 'farmers' markets' in every union parishad to help get fair prices for their produce. Tk 20 crore has been allocated for the purpose, Anwarul said. The government has also decided in principle to disburse soft loans among farmers through the Bangladesh Rural Development Board to encourage jute farming, he said. He added that the government was already providing subsidies to farmers, but regretted that the subsidies were not benefitting consumers. Government and NGO officials, union parishad chairmen, business leaders, farmers representatives, rice traders, fertiliser dealers and journalists participated in the meeting. bdnews2
