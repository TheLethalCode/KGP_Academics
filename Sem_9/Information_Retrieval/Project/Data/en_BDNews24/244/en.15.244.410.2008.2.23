<TITLE> Arsenal's Eduardo suffers serious leg injury </TITLE>

 LONDON, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Arsenal striker Eduardo da Silva sustained a serious leg injury in the Premier League match against Birmingham City on Saturday. The match was stopped for nearly eight minutes as the Brazilian-born Croatia international was treated on the field before finally being carried off on a stretcher. Birmingham City defender Martin Taylor was given a straight red card for his challenge on Eduardo in the third minute. Arsenal's players wandered around the pitch looking distraught and Sky television said they would not replay the incident because the pictures were too horrific. Eduardo was taken straight to hospital and medical staff at the ground were also reported to be shocked at the seriousness of the injury. No official comment on his condition was immediately available but the BBC said on their Web site (bbc.co.uk) that he had broken his left leg. Born in Rio de Janeiro, the 24-year-old moved to Croatia at the age of 15 to join Dinamo Zagreb as an apprentice although he later returned home to play on loan for two seasons at Bangu, a minor club in Rio's sprawling western suburbs. After obtaining Croatian nationality, he made his full international debut against Ireland in 2004 and is one of a number of Brazilians playing for other national sides. He joined Arsenal in July. Television commentators drew a comparison with the injury to Coventry City defender Dave Busst, whose career ended after he suffered a compound fracture of his right leg against Manchester United in 1996. Play was interrupted for 10 minutes before Busst was stretchered off and blood from his wounds was washed off the pitch
