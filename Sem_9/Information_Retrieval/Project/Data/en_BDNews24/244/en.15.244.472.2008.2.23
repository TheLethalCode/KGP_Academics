<TITLE> Lenin`s follower left out in cold in Russia vote </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Ulyanovsk, Russia, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Even in Lenin's birthplace Gennady Zyuganov, Communist candidate in Russia's presidential election, cannot escape the Kremlin machine. On a campaign trip to this Volga river town, Zyuganov led a procession of supporters to lay a wreath at a statue of the Bolshevik revolutionary who was born 137 years ago. To get there, they had to pick their way through a crowd of teenagers at a pop concert the pro-Kremlin United Russia party was laying on in Lenin Square. The scene in Ulyanovsk was typical of Zyuganov's campaign for the March 2 election. He is the main opposition challenger but his bid has been dwarfed by the political apparatus behind Dmitry Medvedev, the 42-year-old backed by outgoing President Vladimir Putin to be his successor. The state-owned VTsIOM pollster forecasts Zyuganov will take second place with 15 percent of the vote. Medvedev, a former law professor, is predicted to win more than 70 percent of the vote. Every evening Russia's three main television stations give lavish coverage to Medvedev's trips around the Russian provinces. Zyuganov, also criss-crossing the country, rarely makes it on to the prime-time news. "Elections without open dialogue cease to be elections. They are parodies," Zyuganov, an imposing man with a rumbling baritone voice, told his supporters in Ulyanovsk. PULLING HIS PUNCHES? A 63-year-old life-long party functionary, Zyuganov strikes a chord with people who feel nostalgia for Soviet rule. "We were a great power," he said in Ulyanovsk. "Back then when the Chinese didn't have one serious factory, we sailed in the best submarines. We made the best airplanes." The average age of the people listening to him in the regional philharmonic hall was around 60. With Russia enjoying strong economic growth, most of the population is doing too well out of capitalism to seek a return to communism. Some of Zyuganov's critics say there is another reason he is failing to mount a real threat. They suggest he does not challenge too hard for power and in return officials help him keep his job as party leader. Zyuganov lost presidential elections in 1996 and 2000. His party's strength in parliament has fallen from 157 seats in 1995 to 57 today. "They (Kremlin officials) promise ... to 'solve the questions' that Gennady Andreyevich (Zyuganov) has raised, and Gennady Andreyevich promises to 'work up the party's position' on some other issues," said a former Communist Party campaign manager, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "That is how the bargaining goes on ... In the most difficult moments in his party biography, Gennady Andreyevich has gone to the Kremlin for help," he said. "Since 1996 he has never aspired to power." Zyuganov's spokesman Alexander Yushchenko called these allegations "a sham and without foundation". He listed what he said were cases of official pressure on the party, including Communist candidates being barred from elections and intimidation of party workers at polling stations. "The measures which are being taken by local officials (against the party) show that the battle is being conducted in earnest and without compromise," he said.
