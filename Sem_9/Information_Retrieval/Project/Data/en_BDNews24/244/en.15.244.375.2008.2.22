 Dhaka, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League's highest policymaking body Friday sat in a crucial meeting to determine the party's agenda for dialogue with the Election Commission, slated for Feb 25. The meeting at the Gulshan home of acting party chief Zillur Rahman could not reach a decision although talks staggered into late Friday night, a party spokesman said. The commission is set to sit with the party for a second time to discuss possible reforms to electoral laws. The EC has sent all political parties a draft proposal based on the outcome of the first spell of similar discussion on reforms. Friday's meeting began after Maghrib prayers but failed to reach an immediate decision, AL leader Akhteruzzamn Khoka quoted the party's acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam as saying. Khoka said a news briefing would be held on the matter Saturday after a meeting of the party's central working committee. He told waiting reporters that there would be no briefing Friday after the meeting. bdnews24.c
