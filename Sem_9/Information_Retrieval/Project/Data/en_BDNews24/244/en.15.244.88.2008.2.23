<TEXT>
 Colombo, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A bomb blast tore through a passenger bus on the southern outskirts of the Sri Lankan capital on Saturday morning, the military said, blaming the attack on Tamil Tiger rebels. There were no immediate details of any casualties or fatalities from the blast, which occurred at a bus stand in the town of Mount Lavinia, just south of Colombo. It was latest in a series of bombings blamed on the rebels in recent months. "It seems the bomb was planted in the bus," said a military spokesman, declining to be named in line with policy. "Obviously it was the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam)," he added. "Nothing but them." An eyewitness said he could see smoke rising into the air and ambulances rushing to the scene. "There was an explosion that hit a bus. I can see the smoke," said Haren Fernando, a private sector worker who was standing beside the road in Mount Lavinia.
