 BEIJING, Feb 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police in the Chinese capital Beijing have vowed to detain anyone caught distributing nude photos of several Hong Kong pop stars that were recently posted on the Internet, state media reported on Thursday. Hong Kong police said some 1,300 private shots of the celebrities had been stolen by the staff of a computer repair shop from a faulty laptop believed to belong to Canadian-born singer and actor Edison Chen.

Authorities in mainland China have ordered Web sites and Internet service providers to exercise self-censorship, filtering and deleting the photos, but private sharing through instant messengers and other software remains rampant. A Beijing Internet content watchdog has cited Chinese search engine giant Baidu for spreading the photos, asking it to apologise to the public, state media reported. Tabloid newspapers in celebrity-mad Hong Kong have devoted wide coverage to the scandal, in which photos appear to include at least six stars including actress Cecilia Chung and singer Gillian Chung.
