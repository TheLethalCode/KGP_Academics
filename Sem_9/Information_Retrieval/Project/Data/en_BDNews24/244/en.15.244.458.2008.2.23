<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com)  A six-scalper from paceman Shahadat Hossain helped Bangladesh bundle South Africa out for 170 in the first innings on the second day of the first test Saturday. Hosts Bangladesh took a slim 22-run lead in the first innings, for the sixth time in Bangladesh's test history. Shahadat claimed six for 27 at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium, eclipsing his previous best of 5/86 against Sri Lanka in Bogra in 2006. After the lunch break, the 21-year old pacer uprooted Makhaya Ntini's stumps to wrap up South Africa's first innings before trapping Mark Boucher leg before for 11. Just before the lunch break, Shahadat struck a double blow to reduce South Africa to 158 for eight, having Morne Morkel caught out by Mushfiqur for a five-ball one and removing Johan Botha for 25. Mohammad Ashraful broke the 68-run sixth wicket partnership between Botha and AB de Villiers removing the latter in his first delivery of the day. Steve Bucknor gave a controversial out to Villiers, who got a thick edge while trying to pull on an Ashraful double bounce delivery. Villiers, believing it was a dead ball, stayed at the crease until Bucknor raised his fingers. Villiers, who was dropped on 30 by Ashraful off Mohammad Rafique, and survived a bold appeal for lbw from Rafique in the next delivery, scored 46 off 73 balls hitting seven fours and one six. After having resumed the day on 76 for four, South Africa lost an indecisive Prince in the day's second over to be reduced to 77 for five. Prince was unable to make up his mind after driving Shahadat at cover, and keeper Mushfiqur Rahim did not hesitate to whip off the bails from a throw by Shakib Al Hasan. South Africa having resumed on 76 for four to add 94 losing remaining wickets to finish at 170 all out, allowing the hosts to a 22-run lead. bd
