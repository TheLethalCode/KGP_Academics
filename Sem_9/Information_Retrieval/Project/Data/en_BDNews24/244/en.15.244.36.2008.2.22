 Felicia Loo SINGAPORE, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil drifted down to $98 a barrel on Friday, pulling further away from its recent record above $101 as rising U.S. crude and gasoline stockpiles added to evidence of slowing demand in the world's largest consumer. U.S. crude futures for April delivery eased 39 cents to $97.84 a barrel, extending Thursday's $1.47 fall. Prices have now fallen 3.4 percent from the record of $101.32 a barrel achieved on Wednesday before the March contract expired. "There is an opportunity for a sell-down, particularly from the rising U.S. crude stockpile," " said Gerard Burg of National Australia Bank in Sydney. "There is little to sustain prices above $100." U.S. government data showed a sharp 4.2 million barrel build in crude stockpiles last week, the sixth straight week of gains and nearly double analyst forecasts. Despite lower refinery utilization due to seasonal maintenance and operational hiccups, gasoline stocks swelled 1.1 million barrels to a 14-year high of 230.3 million barrels. Analysts said the data show consumers in the U.S. are struggling with high pump prices and a slowing economy as the credit crunch and housing slump take their toll. Prices surged earlier this week as investors and speculators piled back into commodities as a hedge against inflation and as financial markets stalled, but concerns about U.S. fuel demand returned to the fore on Thursday. Investment bank Merrill Lynch said the United States is in a recession that could be much worse than it faced in 2001, and closer to the sharper economic slump of the 1990s. Data out on Thursday also pointed to a weaker economy. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank reported a sharp pullback in Mid-Atlantic manufacturing activity, while another report showed leading economic indicators fell 0.1 percent in January for a fourth straight monthly decline. Comments by OPEC ministers that the group could hold or even reduce output at a March 5 meeting helped send oil on the record rally approaching the inflation-adjusted high of $102.53 hit in April 1980, a year after the Iranian revolution. But the International Energy Agency, which advises industrialized countries on energy matters, has urged OPEC to at least keep oil production unchanged to rebuild low crude stocks.
