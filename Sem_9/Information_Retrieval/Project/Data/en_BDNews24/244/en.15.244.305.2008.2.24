<TEXT>
 MADRID, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazil striker Luis Fabiano scored twice as Sevilla hammered 10-man Real Zaragoza 5-0 with the help of two own goals in the Primera Liga on Saturday. Sevilla ran the visitors ragged with an exhilarating display of attacking football that put them firmly back in the hunt for Champions League qualification places as they climbed to fifth. Luis Fabiano, who leads the league scoring charts with 19 goals, turned in Daniel Alves's cross for the opener after 20 minutes, and a slick passing move with his Brazilian compatriot put him through for his second soon after. A swift counter-attack finished with the ball rebounding off Zaragoza defender Roberto Ayala and into his own net for the third, two minutes before the break. Zaragoza's Uruguayan full back Carlos Diogo put the ball in his own net under pressure from Luis Fabiano soon after the restart, and followed that up with a wild challenge that saw him sent off in the 54th. Mali midfielder Seydou Keita completed the rout with a header from an Alves free kick in the 67th. Zaragoza remain 13th five points above the bottom three. Earlier, Valencia's poor home form continued to haunt them as they were held to a 1-1 draw by lowly Recreativo Huelva. Forward Juan Mata opened the scoring for the home side in the 39th minute after a wonderful pass from Argentine midfielder Ever Banega, but Recre's Portuguese midfielder Carlos Martins levelled from outside the area just after the restart. Ronald Koeman's side, who have a King's Cup semi-final first leg against Barcelona next week, missed a host of chances to wrap up the points but remain ninth. The rest of the league action takes place on Sunday when second-placed Barcelona are at home to bottom club Levante, and leaders Real Madrid host near neighbours Getafe at the Bernabeu
