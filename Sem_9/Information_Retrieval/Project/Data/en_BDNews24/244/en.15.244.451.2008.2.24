 Dhaka, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com)  Two quickfire bursts from skipper Wayne Parnell and Jonathan Vandiar powered South Africa to a fighting total of 242 against Bangladesh in the ICC U/19 World Cup quarterfinal at Bayuemas Oval, Kuala Lumpur, Sunday. Sent in to bat first, Bangladesh got off to a fine start with pacer Shubashish Roy rattling the top order, but they failed to keep the momentum as Parnell and Vandiar blazed 57 and 45 respectively. Roy struck first having opener Pieter Malan (17) caught by Ashraful Hossain in 10.1 overs while Saikat Ali ran out one-down Rilee Rossouw to reduce South Africa to 40 for two in 10.2 overs. Vandiar and Yaseen Vallie defied the Bangladesh attack to put on 66 runs for the fifth wicket after Roy and Nasir Hossain dismissed opener J Smuts (16) and Reeza Hendricks (22) respectively to reduce South Africa to 69 for four in 17.4 overs. Saikat Ali, playing his first match, broke the 66-run fifth wicket partnership removing Vandiar, who smashed five fours and one six in his 47ball knock. Dollar Mahmud sent Vallie (28) back to the dressing room before Rubel Hossain had Roy Adams caught by Suhrawardi Shuvo for 14. But skipper Parnell and Bradley Barnes blunted the Bangladeshi bowlers to add 59 runs for the eighth wicket before Rubel removed Parnell in the last over. Parnell hit eight fours facing 60 balls while Barnes remained unbeaten with 22 off 28 balls. Shubashish and Rubel grabbed two wickets each for 30 and 41 respectively. bd
