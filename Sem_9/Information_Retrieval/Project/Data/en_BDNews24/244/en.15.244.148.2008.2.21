<TITLE> Gaffar Chowdhury deplores 'drift from secular values' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Maskwaith Ahsan bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, Feb 21 (bdnews24.com)Secular values are dwindling. "Religious fanaticism is taking a firm foothold in our midst." This is what Abdul Gaffar Chowdhury, long based in London, says in a phone interview with bdnews24.com. The writer and columnist regrets that the odyssey Bangladeshis startedinspired by the supreme sacrifices of 1952 Language Movement martyrsveered in a different direction, which is less than expected. Chowdhury deplores the fading values of secularism that shaped the emergence of an independent country in 1971. The lyrics of the song amar bhaier raktey rangano Ekushey February has powered Chowdhury to popularity as its creator, lyricist and composer. A pertinent question was inevitable, and so was Chowdhury's reminiscent response. "I happened to compose the lyrics as my impromptu reaction to the Feb 21, 1952 police firing on the Language Movement processionists," he says. "As soon as I heard about the firing, I rushed to the emergency room of Dhaka Medical College Hospital. I found a body lying therethe skull blown off. I thought it was Barkat'smy brother's corpse. I came to know subsequently that it belonged to the language martyr Rafiq." "Abdul Latif had first composed the music and sung Amar bhaier...." Two years later, Shaheed Altaf Mahmud composed the music again, which has since been sung by millions through the month of February every year, and especially as the solemn song for morning processions on Feb 21. "The song was disbanded along with the periodical that contained it, by the then Pakistani rulers," he says. "Zahir Raihan's masterly use of the dirge in his film Jivan Thekey Neya' made it a soul-reaching song sung by almost everybody." "As Feb 21 was accorded international recognition as International Mother Language Day, the song too started to be sung internationally. It has, in the meantime, been translated into Swedish and Japanese." Asked how he evaluates the achievements of the nation from Feb 21, 1952 through to Feb 21, 2008, Chowdhury says, "There is ample space for rousing even the most pessimistic soul." "What saddens me is the trauma the nation has been suffering of late. The trend of drifting from a secular nationalist conscience into an extremely religion-based fanaticism has tarnished our attainments to a considerable extent." On how he looks at the adulteration of the mother language, that is, the trend of speaking Bangla in unfamiliar accent or writing the language in 'Banglish' form, interspersing it freely with half-cooked English, Chowdhury says: "Well, Bangla has enriched itself through borrowing from other languages it interacted with. That was a natural process." "In West Bengal, some people speak Bangla mixing it with Hindi and I'll object to a similar practice in the case of Bangla." "Satyajit Ray had cast Babita in his 'Ashani Sanket' because he wanted her to speak Bangla properly." Chowdhury considers it was a folly to ban English from the higher education curricula, because it made English accessible to a handful, giving rise to disparities. Bangladesh should have kept English in use, just as any other foreign language, which would have facilitated learning the most-spoken international language and accessing global knowledge bases without difficulty, he says. Chowdhury seems happy with the performance of the young writers from Bangladesh. "Bangla literature today has broken its rural shackles and its boundaries have widened to reach global heights. Today's litterateurs are portraying our people boldly, experimenting with forms, dictions and sub-languages too. I'm encouraged," Chowdhury says. He, however, censures and accuses some of dealing with shallow themes and hollow glamour. "Young writers must not engage in writing bestsellers alone. They shouldn't be blinded by the glitter of showmanship," he warns. "The Bangalees read Tarashankar or Manik; some also doted on Niharranjan or Nimaiboth popular. But in the end, you see, it's Tarashankar or Manik who ruled the readers' conscience." Asked to comment on the use of 'politics' in contemporary Bangla literature, Chowdhury says: "No, religious fanaticism or politics is not being portrayed by our contemporaries as some of our predecessors, such as Syed Waliullah or Abul Kalam Shamsuddin had done so naturally and boldly.' "But I have vowed to remain optimistic about our future and attainment of our goal." bdnew
