 MUMBAI, India, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chennai splashed out $1.5 million for Indian one-day captain Mahendra Dhoni on Wednesday in a player auction for India's new money-spinning cricket tournament. Dhoni was snapped up by the southern metropolis side in the first round of a glitzy sale to determine who plays where in the Twenty20 Indian Premier League starting in April. Retired Australian spin-bowler Shane Warne was the first player to go under the hammer in a five-star Mumbai hotel conference room filled with Indian sportsmen, celebrities and tycoons. Warne fetched his base price of $450,000 and was bought by Jaipur. The eight franchise teams of the IPL -- Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Kolkata, Mohali and Mumbai -- have a budget of up to $5 million each for a maximum of eight contracted players. They are bidding for 78 players and the closed-door auction could last up to 12 hours. Twenty20 cricket is a shortened version of the game designed to be attractive to both spectators at the ground and TV viewers. In this form, both teams play a single innings and bat for a maximum of 20 overs. The 44-day IPL starts on April 18 and will feature 59 matches. BOLLYWOOD STARS Some of the country's biggest companies, including India's most valuable company Reliance Industries, and spirit company UB Group have bought franchises. Bollywood stars Shah Rukh Khan and Preity Zinta have bought into the Kolkata and Mohali franchises, adding further glamour to the league. No single event has made global cricket news in this manner since Kerry Packer's circuit over thirty years ago, but unlike the IPL, the late Australian media magnate's event was a breakaway league. Australian 'keeper-batsman Adam Gilchrist, who last month retired from test cricket, went to the Hyderabad franchise for $700,000, but Dhoni was the costliest purchase, going for almost four times his base price of $400,000. Sri Lanka's Muttiah Muralitharan went to Chennai for $600,000. His base price was $250,000. The players are being put up for bidding in sets of 12 according to their annual base price, multiple-skills and expected availability for the inaugural year. Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene was bought up by the Mohali franchise for $475,000, nearly twice his base price of $250,000 while temperamental Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar went to Kolkata for $425,000. Akhtar's base price was $250,000. The player contracts are for a period of three years
