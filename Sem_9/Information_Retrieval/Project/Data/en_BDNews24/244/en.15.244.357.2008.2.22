 MELBOURNE, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Michael Clarke and Mike Hussey both scored half centuries to rescue Australia's innings in their triangular one-day series against Sri Lanka on Friday. Clarke scored 50 while Hussey was 64 not out as the world champions posted a miserable 184 for seven off their 50 overs. Mitchell Johnson was six not out with Hussey while Farveez Maharoof, who bowled his 10 overs unchanged, was the pick of the Sri Lankans with figures of 2-20.

Matthew Hayden looked to impose himself on Sri Lanka's bowlers and moved to 23 but he mistimed a delivery from Maharoof and hit it straight to Chamara Silva. Australia captain Ricky Ponting's recent poor form continued when he was run out for 11 with the score on 44 and he was followed back to the pavilion shortly after by Andrew Symonds (four) who got an inside edge to a Maharoof delivery that was easily taken by wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara. Hussey and Clarke then combined for their face-saving partnership before the latter was caught and bowled by Muttiah Muralitharan just after he reached 50. The off-spinner grabbed a second wicket when James Hopes overbalanced and was stumped by Sangakkara for 11, while Brad Hogg was well caught low down by Tillakaratne Dilshan at point off Lasith Malinga for four. Sri Lanka must win the match to give themselves any chance of making the finals of the triangular series, that also includes Indi
