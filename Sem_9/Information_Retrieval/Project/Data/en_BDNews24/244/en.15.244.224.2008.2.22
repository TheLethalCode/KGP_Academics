<TITLE> UK consulting over nuclear clean-up fund </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain has started consulting on the best way for nuclear operators to handle costs from disposing of radioactive waste from a new generation of reactors and from breaking them up at the end of their lives. Britain gave the go-ahead to a new generation of nuclear power stations last month, setting no limits on nuclear expansion and adding momentum to atomic energy's worldwide renaissance. "Funds will be sufficient, secure and independent; it will be a criminal offence not to comply with the approved arrangements, and we are taking powers to guard against unforeseen shortfalls," said Business Secretary John Hutton. The ruling Labour government considered nuclear power unattractive as recently as 2003 but now says it will help Britain meet its climate change goals and avoid overdependence on imported energy amid dwindling North Sea supplies. Nuclear power stations provide about 18 percent of Britain's electricity now, but many are nearing the end of their lives. Nuclear operator British Energy said it had always agreed that operators should fully fund clean-up costs and work without subsidies. The government could demand that over 200 million pounds ($393 million) is put in a secure fund for dealing with the waste from each 1 gigawatt nuclear power station, according to figures in the 2006 energy review. The charges will include the cost of enlarging a planned nuclear storage site deep underground to take operator's future waste. Industry sources say this is most likely to be built in Cumbria, northwest England. But the government will also demand operators pay a heavy premium to cover the risk the geological disposal facility exceeds its budget or is not ready on time. A further 300 million to 600 million pounds could also be demanded to cover the cost of shutting down the stations at the end of their lives, breaking them up and returning the sites to something close to a natural "greenfield" state. "That fund won't be needed for decades, so will be ring-fenced to ensure no-one will be able to dip into it for any purpose whatever other than waste and decommissioning," said a source familiar with government thinking. "There'll be no possibility of raiding this particular pension fund or risky pension holidays," added the source.
