<TITLE> Nissan to take humble approach in India </TITLE>

 Rina Chandran CHENNAI, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co will take a humble approach to India where it is a late entrant, using its alliances to build a strong vehicle line-up in a market that can help offset softness in the United States, a senior company official said. Nissan and partner Renault on Friday signed an agreement for a $1.0 billion car and engine plant in southern India after a local partner dropped out, and expect to commence production from 2010. Nissan, which has just two vehicles in the Indian market now, expects to have eight vehicles in the market by 2012, including commercial vehicles for which it has a venture with Indian truck maker Ashok Leyland, said Colin Dodge, senior vice president, general overseas market operations, Nissan. The fast-growing markets of Brazil, Russia, India and China are a top priority for Nissan, as its main U.S. and Japanese markets saturate. A weaker dollar, another concern for carmakers, is not having as big an impact on Nissan, as it produces "more than 60 percent in the currency where we sell them", Dodge told Reuters late on Friday after the signing of a memorandum of understanding for the plant with Tamil Nadu. "But in terms of the actual U.S. market declining, that's a bit of a pain," he said. "There has been a recent upsurge in places like Brazil, Russia, China and the Middle East, which can offset that somewhat, but the U.S. is the most profitable market and it's quite difficult to compensate entirely for it." "There may be a slowdown in the short to medium term, but I think the U.S. will always be a 15-16 million car market," he said. A new business plan is scheduled to be unveiled in April for the three years to March 2011. Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of Renault and Nissan, has signalled accelerating growth with more than 33 new models compared with 28 during the past three years. Dodge said he expected the plan to reflect global economic changes such as record-high oil prices and volatile commodity costs. But he was optimistic about the new financial year from April, he said. "This year looks better than last year: Russia, China and the Middle East are booming and there will be more new products." The timing of the start of manufacturing in India was later than they would have liked, Dodge said, but not irreparably so. "We had the same conversation about China four years ago, but we've done a good job of recovering from the late start there," he said. "Maybe we would've preferred to come in here a year earlier, but we will have a humble approach: our first priority is to get the product right, get the distribution right, and make this a solid base without worrying about market share." Japan's third-biggest carmaker has four car models in the pipeline for the Chennai plant, including an A-segment entry-level hatchback, a first for Nissan, which it will also export. "Obviously, if you want to be in India you have to have a compact car," Dodge said. Small cars make up more than two-thirds of sales of passenger vehicles in India, which are expected to nearly double to 2 million units by 2010. About half the market is controlled by Suzuki Motor Corp's India unit, followed by Hyundai Motor Co and Tata Motors. Tata Motors, also the top truck maker, last month rolled out the Nano, a small car priced at just above $2,500, or roughly half the price of the cheapest car in India now. The Renault-Nissan combine is studying the feasibility of a $3,000 car with Indian motorcycle maker Bajaj Auto to take on Nano, and expects to sign a deal this year. Nissan will also move quickly to roll out trucks in India with partner Leyland. "Nissan has done very well in LCVs elsewhere. We won't be long entering the market here," Dodge said.
