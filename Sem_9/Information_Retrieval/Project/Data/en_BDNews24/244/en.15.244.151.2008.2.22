<TITLE> Oil up near $99, Turkish incursion supports </TITLE>

 London, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil rose towards $99 a barrel on Friday, led higher by strong prices for heating fuel and supported by rising tensions in the Middle East after thousands of Turkish troops crossed into northern Iraq. U.S. crude futures for April delivery rose 30 cents to $98.53 a barrel by 1324 GMT, resuming its climb after sliding on Thursday on rising U.S. crude and gasoline stockpiles. London Brent crude rose 39 cents to $96.63 a barrel. "Gas oil cracks have strengthened and have pulled up crude as well," said Mike Wittner, head of global oil research at Societe Generale. The premium of ICE gas oil futures to Brent crude, known in the industry as cracks, rose as high as $19.890 a barrel, the strongest level since mid-October 2005, a sign that supply of the product is tight at a time of intensifying cold weather. Oil's March contract hit a record high of $101.32 on Wednesday, taking it near its all-time inflation-adjusted high of $102.53 hit in April 1980, boosted by a tide of investor cash chasing commodities as a safer investment option at a time of rising inflation and overall market turmoil. However, prices fell on Thursday after official U.S. data showed a sharp 4.2 million-barrel build in crude stockpiles last week, the sixth straight week of gains and nearly double forecasts, and gasoline stocks also rose to a 14-year high. Analysts said the data showed U.S. consumers were struggling with high pump prices and heightened fears of a recession in the economy roiled by a credit crunch and a housing slump. But continuing demand strength in China and India is likely to keep oil well supported through any slowdown in the west, as are threats to supplies from Africa and the Middle East. Thousands of Turkish troops crossed into northern Iraq in their hunt for Kurdish PKK guerrillas, a senior military source said on Friday, in an escalation of a conflict that could destabilise the region. The northern part of Iraq is an oil producing region. The surge in prices earlier this week came despite persistent concerns about the U.S. economy, the world's top oil consumer, and with it worries about oil demand. Investment bank Merrill Lynch said the United States is in a recession that could be much worse than it faced in 2001, and closer to the sharper economic slump of the 1990s. "With oil demand growth risks skewed to the downside in the US we believe there is a growing risk that oil prices are now entering overbought territory," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a research note. Oil has averaged $93.02 a barrel this year, up nearly a third on the average in 2007 of $72.30.
