 Mutare, Zimbabwe, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe's main opposition party vowed on Saturday to sweep President Robert Mugabe from power in next month's elections and restore the African nation's shattered economy and international reputation. The Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) has come closest to unseating Mugabe in recent elections, but it is limping into the March 29 poll, weakened by a violent government crackdown on anti-Mugabe activists, divisions within its ranks and the emergence of a rival presidential candidate from Mugabe's party. Launching his election campaign in this eastern border town near Mozambique, Morgan Tsvangirai, the leader of the largest of two MDC factions, told supporters Zimbabweans were ready to end Mugabe's 28-year rule and hand the MDC power. "We remain the legitimate voice of democratic change in this country," Tsvangirai said in a stadium in Mutare, some 265 km (165 miles) east of the capital Harare. "All of Zimbabwe is in the custody of a dictatorship. We're all bleeding, but we're marching on. We're weak and with hunger, but we're stronger with anger." Political analysts say Mugabe, 84, who officially launched his re-election campaign on Saturday with a rally in Beitbridge on Zimbabwe's border with South Africa, may face the most serious political challenge of his career next month. Tsvangirai and former Finance Minister Simba Makoni are the main contenders running against Mugabe in the presidential poll. The country is also holding parliamentary and municipal elections. Makoni's candidacy in particular has stirred Mugabe's anger. The ruling ZANU-PF party expelled the challenger earlier this month, and Mugabe compared his younger rival -- Makoni is 58 -- to a political prostitute. INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT But the opposition could divide the anti-Mugabe vote and hand the veteran leader another five years in office. Tsvangirai, who accuses Mugabe of rigging past elections, has refused to run a joint campaign with Makoni, while a splinter MDC group has thrown its weight behind the former finance minister. Both Tsvangirai and Makoni are campaigning on a platform of ending Zimbabwe's economic crisis, which they and Western nations blame on government mismanagement and policies, such as the seizure of thousands of white-owned farms. Zimbabweans are struggling to survive amid surging inflation, now above 100,000 percent, unemployment of more than 80 percent and chronic shortages of food, fuel and water. Millions have left the country to look for work and food. Tsvangirai on Saturday raised the prospect that a new government could tap the goodwill of Western nations and others who want to see Mugabe and the ZANU-PF administration ousted. "We need the international community to help us rebuild our economy, but we cannot rely on outside help in perpetuity," he said. "Robert Mugabe is one of the greatest tyrants of the 21st century, when we bring him down, they (international community) will be there to help us, I can assure you this." Although Tsvangirai's MDC has said it doubts the general elections will be free and fair, it has decided to contest them anyway. "I want to restore the dignity of every Zimbabwean again," Tsvangirai said.
