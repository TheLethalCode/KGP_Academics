 SINGAPORE, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An election planned by Myanmar's generals must be credible, the Association of South East Nations said on Wednesday, adding the outcome would affect all members of the 10-nation group. Myanmar's ruling generals earlier this month announced a referendum in May on a new constitution, to be followed by an election in 2010. If held, the poll would be the first since a 1990 election whose outcome the military ignored. "What we are concerned about is the credibility of the process," Singapore's Foreign Minister George Yeo said on Wednesday. "There must be provisions for independent verification and many of us expressed the view that Myanmar cannot ignore the international dimension," he told reporters after a meeting of ASEAN foreign ministers in the city-state.

But isolating the junta could drive Myanmar further into China's embrace and to ASEAN's disadvantage. ASEAN has instead opted for "engagement" with Myanmar, calling on the junta to work with the United Nations towards democracy and to release political detainees. Myanmar's generals last held elections in 1990, but ignored them when Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy won a landslide. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate has spent more than 12 of the past 18 years under some form of detenti
