<TITLE> British prostitute killer gets life without parole </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A married British man who murdered five young women in 2006 was sentenced on Friday to life in jail without the chance of remission. Forklift truck driver Steve Wright, 49, asphyxiated the women, all drug addicts aged under 30 who worked as prostitutes in the town of Ipswich, northeast of London. Wright, who had sex with four of the five women, left two of the bodies in a crucifix position with arms outstretched. "It is right you should spend your whole life in prison," judge Peter Gross told Ipswich Crown Court. "This was a targeted campaign of murder." Drugs and prostitution had exposed them to risk but neither, he added, had killed them. "You did -- you are responsible for their deaths," he told an expressionless Wright. "You killed them, stripped them and left them in rural or semi-rural locations. "Why you did it may never be known but as the jury have concluded, disbelieving your denials, murder them you did. As a result, there is only one sentence -- that of life imprisonment." Wright consistently denied the allegations even though his DNA was found on three of the victims and bloodstains from two of them were found on his jacket at his home. After Wright's conviction on Thursday, the families of two of the dead women called for the return of the death penalty. Wright's father told newspapers he had disowned his son and wanted him to die for his crimes. Wright, labelled the "Suffolk Strangler" by the media, had murdered the five women while his 63-year-old partner Pamela was working night shifts. Their bodies were found in the space of just 10 days around the city. After two days of deliberations, the jury of nine men and three women found Wright guilty on Thursday of murdering Gemma Adams, 25, Tania Nicol, 19, Anneli Alderton, 24, Paula Clennell, 24, and Annette Nicholls, 29. The court had heard that in the three months before his Dec. 19, 2006 arrest, Wright, the son of an RAF policeman, had sex with a dozen prostitutes. Detective Chief Superintendent Stewart Gull of Suffolk Police said the "appalling crimes left a community, a county and a nation in a state of profound shock".
