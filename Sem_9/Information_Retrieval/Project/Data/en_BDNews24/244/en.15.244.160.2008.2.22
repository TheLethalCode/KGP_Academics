<TITLE> Congo peace deal faces hitch over massacre charges </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Kinshasa, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A month-old peace accord in east Democratic Republic of Congo faced a fresh hitch on Friday when Tutsi rebels halted participation in a ceasefire commission in protest at UN allegations they had massacred civilians. The move announced by renegade Tutsi General Laurent Nkunda posed a potential threat to the Jan. 23 ceasefire and peace pact signed by Nkunda's rebels, Congolese President Joseph Kabila's government and rival eastern militia groups. The United Nations and Western governments brokered the deal in the hope of establishing a lasting peace in Congo's turbulent east, where rebel and militia violence has persisted long after the formal end of a 1998-2003 war in the central African state. Nkunda was reacting to allegations by U.N. investigators that his Tutsi fighters killed at least 30 Hutu civilians last month while his rebel group negotiated the peace deal, which has already been strained by renewed skirmishes in the east. "We are demanding these things be verified by a mixed investigation made up of the government, the U.N., and us," Nkunda told Reuters by telephone. Denying his rebel group was involved in the alleged massacre, Nkunda said: "They are spreading rumours, and we cannot accept that this continues". Nkunda said that until an independent inquiry was launched, his representatives were suspending their participation in an ad hoc commission tasked with sorting out technical aspects of the ceasefire and plotting the future course of the peace process. But a rebel spokesman said the move did not mean that Nkunda's National Congress for the Defence of the People (CNDP) insurgent group was withdrawing definitively from the ceasefire and peace pact signed last month. There was no immediate reaction to Nkunda's statement from the U.N. Mission in Congo (MONUC), which has 17,000 peacekeeping troops in the vast, mineral-rich former Belgian colony. Despite the signing of last month's peace deal and the creation of around 30 U.N. peacekeeping bases in a buffer zone between the warring factions, almost daily clashes have been reported between Nkunda loyalists and Mai Mai militia. U.N. IMPARTIALITY QUESTIONED The U.N. rights investigators' report, which became public this week, alleged that Tutsi fighters loyal to Nkunda shot, hacked with machetes, or beat to death with hammers at least 30 Hutu civilians on Jan. 16 and 17 around Kalonge, around 100 km (64 miles) west of Goma, capital of east North Kivu province. Nearly all the victims were men, though a one-year-old baby, a 14-year-old boy, and a woman were also killed. At the time of the killings, Nkunda CNDP delegates were attending talks in the North Kivu capital Goma on the ceasefire and peace pact subsequently signed on Jan. 23. While announcing its withdrawal from "all meetings relating to the Act of Engagement", as the Jan. 23 deal is known, the rebel CNDP said nevertheless it was willing to cooperate with international mediators to clear up the massacre allegations. But it questioned MONUC's impartiality, saying the allegations made by the U.N. investigators infringed the U.N.'s role as a mediator in the eastern Congo peace process. Some 450,000 North Kivu residents fled fighting between government troops, Nkunda loyalists, Rwandan Hutu rebels, and Mai Mai in the year leading up to last month's peace deal. The conflict has its roots in neighbouring Rwanda's 1994 genocide in which around 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were slaughtered. Nkunda says the rebellion he has led since 2004 seeks to protect east Congo's ethnic Tutsi minority against the Rwandan Hutu rebels he says are backed by Congo's government. Human rights watchdogs accuse all parties in the conflict of rapes, killings and looting.
