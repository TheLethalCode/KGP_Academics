<TITLE> Hispanic voters key to Clinton hopes in Texas </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Pharr, Texas, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gloria Colmenares has known tough times and says that's why she cast her ballot for Hillary Clinton in early voting in the Texas Democratic primary. "I know she has money but she still wants to fight for people's rights. And I'd like to see universal health care and more help for the elderly," the 65-year-old widow told Reuters at her modest home in a blue-collar Hispanic neighborhood in this south Texas border town. Clinton's hopes of reviving her struggling presidential campaign rest heavily on Hispanic voters like Colmenares supporting her against Barack Obama on March 4 in the race for her party's nomination for the November election. Analysts say she probably has to win the Texas primary and the same day's Ohio contest to keep her hopes alive. Energized by tough Republican rhetoric and policies against illegal immigration, Hispanics could play a big role in the Democratic vote in Texas -- and to date they have largely backed the New York senator over Obama. But that support no longer seems guaranteed as Obama, on a roll of 10 straight nominating contest wins, makes inroads into Clinton's perceived base of supporters such as women and older voters as well as Hispanics. Obama has momentum on his side and interviews with many potential voters in this heavily Latino region point to the younger generation leaning to the black senator from Illinois. "I have friends and family over there (Iraq) and Obama will end the war," said 18-year-old Jenissa Arrambide, a student at the University of Texas at Brownsville. Several other students indicated a preference for Obama. "I would like to see something new," said Jesus Alaniz, 18, alluding to Obama's presentation of himself as representing change from the Washington politics as usual. According to the Pew Hispanic Center, younger Hispanics mirrored the voting pattern of their parents on the "Super Tuesday" primaries on Feb. 5 and mostly supported Clinton. In 16 Super Tuesday states where there were exit polls, 63 percent of all Hispanics voted for Clinton and she won 62 percent in the 17 to 29 year-age group, said Susan Minushkin of the Pew Hispanic Center. "But this was February 5th and things can change on March 4th," she said in a telephone interview. Both campaigns are scrambling to get the Hispanic vote out. "Latinos have seen a rising share of turnout and given that they are 25 percent of the electorate in Texas and lean Democrat," they could be crucial, said Minushkin. GET OUT THE VOTE Colmenares, who exercised her right to vote days ahead of the contest, voiced concerns about the economy and a lack of affordable health care that are common here, where many Hispanics have felt politically marginalized in the past. The paved road in front of her house was a dirt track until the 1980s, when she also got hooked up to the municipal sewage and water system. Down the road, 40-year-old Andy Franco, a truck driver, said he liked Clinton because of the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, which her husband Bill championed while president. Obama has a more protectionist platform, he said. "NAFTA is good because it helps lots of our businesses," said Franco. Most people also said race was not a factor in their decision despite speculation that Hispanic Americans could be reluctant to vote for a black president. Many voters also approved of Clinton's universal health care plan. Obama's health care plan is similar and would provide coverage for nearly all Americans. At a local public health clinic offering free or subsidized services, about 40 people sat patiently in waiting rooms, underscoring the resonance of the issue here. "We are familiar with the Clinton family and their issues. In particular health which is very important," said Juan Hinojosa, the local state senator in the Texas legislature.
