 Brussels, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union urged Pakistan on Friday to move quickly to form a new government and called for the immediate release of political prisoners. A statement from the Slovenian EU presidency welcomed the holding of parliamentary elections last Monday and said they provided a basis for new democratic development. "The EU hopes to see swift moves towards the formation of a stable and functional government," it said. The government would need to address issues such as strengthening the democratic system, reestablishment of an independent judiciary, respect for human rights, and regional peace and stability, the statement said. The statement said the presidency "deeply regrets" that not all political detainees, including judges and lawyers, had been freed and so had been prevented from participating in the polls. "The EU renews its call for their immediate release. It also reiterates the need for freedom of the media," the statement said. Leaders of the two opposition parties that won the election, the Pakistan People's Party and the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), vowed on Thursday to work together to form a government but said they still had details to work out. This raised the prospect of a government intent on forcing from power President Pervez Musharraf, a key ally of the West in the battle against Islamist militants. Musharraf lost support with a crackdown on opponents and the media last year. Pakistan's Election Commission is expected to issue official results on March 1. Musharraf should then convene an inaugural session of the National Assembly. But how soon after may depend on whether there is a government-in-waiting, as the president must invite a member commanding the confidence of the majority to become prime minister.
