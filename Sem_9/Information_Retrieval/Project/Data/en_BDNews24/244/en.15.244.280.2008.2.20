 ACCRA, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ghanaian President John Kufuor greeted US President George W Bush on Wednesday in a former slave fort overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, which millions of Africans crossed in chains on their way to the Americas. Bush, on the fourth leg of a five-nation tour that will end in nearby Liberia, was due to unveil a plan to fight neglected tropical diseases that cause misery for millions of people on the poorest continent. Thousands lined the streets to greet Bush and school children in uniforms waved Ghana's green, yellow and red flag. Kufuor and Bush, both due to step down after elections due this year, walked down a red carpet together before beginning a meeting at Osu Castle. The imposing former trading fort was built by European colonists and is now more generally known as "The Castle" -- the seat of government in the former British "Gold Coast" colony. Ghana's thriving economy, built on gold and cocoa exports and the promise of oil production within three years, and its stable democracy that stands out in volatile West Africa, has made it a darling of Washington and other donors. History, and a string of accessible former slave trading forts from which captive Africans boarded boats through a "door of no return", have also made it a draw for African Americans seeking their ancestral roots. During his tour, Bush has backed efforts to solve crises in Kenya and Darfur. But his itinerary, taking in Benin, Tanzania and Rwanda, has sought to highlight success stories on a continent often portrayed as a morass of conflict, coups, corruption and famine. Bush's support for multi-billion-dollar anti-malaria and anti-AIDS projects in Africa has earned him an unusually warm reception there despite widespread condemnation of his foreign policy toward Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan. HELP TO FIGHT DISEASE While in Ghana, the U.S. leader planned to announce a plan to help fight neglected tropical diseases like elephantitis, river blindness, hook worm and round worm, a White House official said. Ghana, stable for more than a decade after a period of military rule, is a leading recipient of US aid in Africa, and gets $547 million in US assistance under a five-year anti-poverty programme managed by the US Millennium Challenge Corporation. "Under President Bush, Africa has got more from US foreign policy than any previous American presidency," Ghanaian Foreign Minister Akwasi Osei-Adjei told Reuters in an interview before Bush's arrival. But Osei-Adjei said Ghana would not host any increased US military presence on the continent under the US military command for Africa (Africom), created last year by Washington with a view to strengthening the US presence in Africa. US officials talked initially of plans to move the Africom headquarters to Africa, but African opposition led Washington to change course and say that Africom will not bring any more US troops or bases to the continent. A base for 1,800 US troops exists in Djibouti. On Thursday, Bush visits Liberia -- Africa's first republic, formed by freed slaves from America in 1847. It has offered to host Africom, and Bush says he'll consider this serious
