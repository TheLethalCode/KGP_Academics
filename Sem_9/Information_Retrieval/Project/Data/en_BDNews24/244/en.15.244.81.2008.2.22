 COLOMBO, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tamil Tiger rebels said Sri Lankan government fighter jets killed five civilians in an air raid on their northern stronghold on Friday. Fighting between the military and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam has intensified since the government formally pulled out of a six-year-old ceasefire pact in January, though a renewed war has been raging since 2006. The Air Force said it had bombed and destroyed an isolated rebel boat yard in the village of Kiranchi, west of the Tigers' de facto capital of Kilinochchi, on Friday morning. It declined to comment on the Tiger assertion.

It also came a day after US-based Human Rights Watch called on the UN Security Council to impose sanctions on the Tigers and a splinter faction seen as allied to the government for using children as soldiers. Human Rights Watch also called on the Security Council to publicly condemn the Sri Lankan government, saying it was failing to investigate cases of child abduction and recruitment in territory it controls. It also wants the government reprimanded, accusing elements of the security forces of complicity in abduction of children by the splinter 'Karuna' faction, which analysts say helped the government to evict the Tigers from the ea
