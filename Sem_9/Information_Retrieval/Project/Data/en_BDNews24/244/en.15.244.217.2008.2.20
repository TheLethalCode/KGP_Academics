 MADRID, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid believe their impressive form at the Bernabeu will help them overturn a 2-1 first leg defeat against Roma and advance beyond the last 16 of the Champions League for the first time in four years. "We'll be playing at home, we'll have the support of our home fans and with the way we play, I think we've got a great chance of getting through to the next round," Real Madrid playmaker Guti told reporters after Tuesday's match. "We've got to stay calm and controlled during the second leg because there are still 90 minutes to go and a 1-0 win will see us through." The nine-times European champions took an early lead at the Olympic Stadium with skipper Raul scoring his 60th goal in the competition when he diverted a Guti shot into the net in the eighth minute. But despite dominating for long periods, Bernd Schuster's side were undone by two sharp finishes from David Pizarro and Mancini. "We started pretty well, but just when we had most control over the game they scored their first goal," said Guti. "The result is a little unfair, but that's the way it is with Italian football. They made the most of their strengths and got the result." Real's Italian centre-back Fabio Cannavaro agreed with his team mate. "It was a very strange game because we played very well and it is hard to explain why we did not get a positive result out of it," said the former Juventus defender. "It will be different in Madrid.... At the Bernabeu we will need to show the same sort of enthusiasm only with greater concentration because they can score a goal at slightest opportunity. But it won't be easy for them at the Bernabeu." Real have won all 14 home games in the league and Europe this season, with their only slip-ups coming in the Spanish Super Cup and the King's Cup
