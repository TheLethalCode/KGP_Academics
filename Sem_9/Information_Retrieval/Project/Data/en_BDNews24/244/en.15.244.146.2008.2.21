 SINGAPORE, Feb 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil climbed back above $100 on Thursday, about a dollar off record-highs, on hedge fund inflows and OPEC supply concerns, with traders weighing U.S. economic worries against hopes of more Fed cuts. The new front-month U.S. crude for April delivery rose 48 cents to $100.18 by 2:38 a.m. EST. The March contract, which expired a day ago, rose for five-straight sessions to hit a record of $101.32 on Wednesday, before closing at $100.74 a barrel, the highest settlement ever. "It's almost become self-perpetuating. People are buying because people are buying," said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch & Associates in Galena, Illinois. Crude oil prices are now hovering near the all-time inflation adjusted high of $101.70 hit in April 1980, a year after the Iranian revolution, the International Energy Agency said. London Brent LCOc1 rose 50 cents to $98.92 a barrel. Analysts said funds were rushing into oil and other commodities such as gold as a hedge against inflation, drawing in momentum trades and exacerbating price pressures. U.S. oil inventory data due later in the day are likely to show crude oil stocks rose by 2.3 million barrels last week, the sixth build in a row, a Reuters poll found. Unusually high gasoline stocks were expected to rise by 1.1 million barrels, while distillates should fall by 1.7 million barrels after a spell of cold weather. The oil inventory report is due at 10:30 a.m. EST, delayed a day due to Monday's U.S. Presidents' Day holiday. While U.S. economic data painted a gloomy picture for oil demand in the world's biggest consumer, investors appeared more focused on worsening inflation. The U.S. Consumer Price Index rose faster than expected in January and for the second straight month. And the U.S. central bank lowered its 2008 economic growth forecast, raising fears the world's biggest economy is heading into stagflation -- when growth slows and inflationary pressures persist -- but lifting hopes the Federal Reserves would cut rates further to revive the economy. "That's another reason why oil's been so strong. Markets have been pricing in another interest rate cut. This will weaken the dollar and is bullish for U.S.-dollar denominated commodities," Ritterbusch said. A host of supply risks also lent support to prices, including U.S. refinery problems, the row between Venezuela and Exxon Mobil and expectations that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will hold output levels steady or even reduce them when they meet next month. The International Energy Agency wants OPEC to keep oil production levels unchanged, at the very least, to rebuild low crude stocks, an agency analyst said on Wednesday. Several members including Iran have said high prices are due to speculation, not fundamentals, and they see no need for OPEC action given healthy inventories, but Iraq's oil minister said the cartel is ready to take any measures, including a review of output, to stabilize the market in the wake of record prices.
