 CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US space shuttle Atlantis left orbit on Wednesday and headed toward a landing in Florida ahead of a US military operation to shoot a dead spy satellite out of the sky. Flying over the Indian Ocean, shuttle commander Stephen Frick and pilot Alan Poindexter fired Atlantis' twin braking rockets at around 8 a.m. EST (1300 GMT) to begin an hour-long descent back to Earth. Touchdown at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida was expected at 9:07 a.m. (1407 GMT). "The weather's looking real nice," astronaut Jim Dutton radioed to the crew from Mission Control in Houston. Atlantis blasted off 13 days ago to deliver Europe's first permanent space laboratory, Columbus, to the International Space Station. NASA took the unusual step of staffing its backup landing site in California for the shuttle's first landing opportunity in case weather at the Florida spaceport prevented a touchdown there. The U.S. military wanted the shuttle down as soon as possible so it could proceed with a plan to shoot down an ailing spy satellite, which will create a debris cloud at the edge of the atmosphere, presenting a possible hazard to a returning space shuttle. The debris is expected to burn up in the atmosphere within a few days. The military has said it will fire a ship-based missile at the satellite, which died shortly after a 2006 launch, because it is carrying toxic rocket fuel that could endanger populated areas if it re-entered the atmosphere without human intervention to guide it into the ocean. The shootdown could come as early as Wednesday night. The satellite is lower than the space station, which orbits 200 miles (320 km) above Earth, and the military says the missile should therefore not be a danger to the stati
