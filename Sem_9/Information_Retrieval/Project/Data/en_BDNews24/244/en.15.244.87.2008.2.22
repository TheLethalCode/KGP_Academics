<TITLE> Suppose they held a telecoms show and nobody turned up </TITLE>

 Martyn Warwick London, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com/telecomtv.com)  As the tens of thousands of delegates and visitors who attended the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona last week struggle to regain their equilibrium after one of the most enervating and expensive weeks of their lives, some of those that had been due to exhibit at another of the world's most prestigious international telecoms meetings have said "enough is enough" and are boycotting the event. Major telecoms operators including AT&T, BT, Deutsche Telekom and Tata Communications have all withdrawn their support for the Intelsat-hosted Global Telecommunications Meeting, (GTM) that has been held annually in Washington DC for the past 34 years. GTM has long been regarded as one of the world's pre-eminent venues for bilateral negotiations, last year attracting 3,500 delegates from 700 global carriers. But now major players representing some 70 per cent of global telecoms traffic have swung their support behind an alternative event, International Telecoms Week, which is also scheduled to be held in DC during the same week in June. Organised by the UK-headquartered industry publisher Capacity Media, the new event will take place at the Washington Hilton, a mile down Connecticut Avenue from the Marriot Hotel where the emasculated GTM show will be staged. The telcos are boycotting the event for one simple reason  the greed of the organisers. In a widely circulated industry email, Sydney, Australia-based iBasis sales executive Stuart Thornton writes that major carriers have "complained to Intelsat about the unjustifiable price increases and the changes it is making to GTM, essentially turning it from an efficient global trade meeting into a wasteful trade show, contrary to the interest and desire of the industry." The email continues, "Intelsat failed to reply with an acceptable proposal so we decided to fully support the creation of a new event, International Telecoms Week, to replace GTM." In a separate and earlier email, Mr. Thornton's colleague, Valerie Tartrou, writes, "Unfortunately, in planning the 2008 event, the organiser of GTM has intensified its effort to transform it from the efficient and useful trading event that it has been into a trade show by raising prices dramatically  by almost 300 percent over the past two years  and by forcing participating carriers to commit to buying exorbitant sponsorship packages, filled with unwanted, wasteful activities, as a prerequisite for securing sufficient meeting rooms." Valerie Tartrou also reveals that final decision to proceed with ITW was taken only late last month after the carriers presented Intelsat with an ultimatum  an ultimatum that was ignored. The rebellion against the perceived greed of the organisers is widespread. The founding supporters of the new event are AT&T Wholesale, Belgacom, BT, Capacity Magazine, China Telecom, Chunghwa Telecom, Deutsche Telekom ICSS, iBasis, IDT Telecom, Orange, PLDT, Reach, Rostelecom, Singtel, Sprint, Tata Communications, Telecom Italia Sparkle, Telefonica, TeliaSonera International Carrier, Telekom Austria, Telekom Malaysia and Telecom New Zealand  all of whom say they will not attend GTM. Meanwhile, having had its bluff well and truly called, Intelsat is trying scrape something together from the ruins. In an email to past attendees, and back-pedalling like a demented unicyclist on the conditions it was earlier trying to impose, Intelsat says, "GTM 2008 promises to be the best event yet, designed to deliver a memorable and productive event for all. GTM has been, and will remain, an efficient trading and networking convention. Enhancements slated for GTM 2008 are in clear support of that mission: Expanded networking opportunities; more meeting space; and more effective, efficient delivery of services. Conference options include a 'request for meeting space only' category along with participant packages ranging from Platinum to Patron level sponsorships." The mass boycott of GTM is not without precedent  carriers from the Philippines have refused to attend the annual Pacific Telecommunications Council gathering in Hawaii after, back in 2003, several of their executives were subpoenaed by the US Department of Justice in their Honolulu hotel rooms. While the DoJ's investigations into an international trade spat over the termination rates charged by Philippines telcos eventually blew over, the anger and outrage felt in the country did not. The telcos set up their own rival Asia-America carrier gathering that is now in its third year and attracted 450 delegates last time around  a respectable number. Furthermore, industry outrage at the exorbitant prices involved in attending the ITU World Telecom event in Geneva eventually resulted in the venue being moved to Hong Kong. That show two years ago, was a shadow of its former self and generally regarded as a monumental flop. Thus the next World Telecom will be back in Geneva, a dour city renowned the world over for its rip-off prices and abysmal service. This time though, says the ITU, things will be different and the UN agency claims that it has secured a promise from the canton that prices will not be raised for the event and that the traditional Swiss pastime of fleecing of the delegates will not take place. Few believe it and time will tell. However, should prices even begin to approach their previous astronomical levels, it will be the kiss of death because the industry really has had enough. That reality, and today's story, should perhaps give the organisers of other big events pause for thought. Some are pushing the patience of the industry to its limits, and what's happened in Washington could just be the start of a trend.
