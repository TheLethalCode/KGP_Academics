 LONDON, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Premier League leaders Arsenal suffered a double blow at Birmingham City on Saturday when they were held to a 2-2 draw and lost striker Eduardo da Silva to a terrible leg injury. James McFadden equalised for Birmingham with a penalty five minutes into stoppage time after Theo Walcott's first league goals for Arsenal early in the second half had put his team 2-1 ahead and on course for an eight-point lead in the title race. The match was overshadowed by the third-minute tackle by Martin Taylor that left Eduardo with a broken left leg. The Brazilian-born Croatia international needed eight minutes of treatment before being taken to hospital. Taylor was shown a straight red card for the tackle. Ten-man Birmingham took the lead after 28 minutes when McFadden was fouled on the edge of the box by Mathieu Flamini and the Scotland striker curled in a glorious free kick. Manchester United can close the gap to three points in their late kickoff at Newcastle United. In other matches Liverpool host Middlesbrough and Portsmouth face Sunderland
