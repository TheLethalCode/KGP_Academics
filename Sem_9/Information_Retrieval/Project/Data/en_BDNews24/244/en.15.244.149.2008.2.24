 HONOLULU, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - David Beckham had a hand in both Los Angeles Galaxy goals as his Major League Soccer side clinched third place in the Pan Pacific Championship with a 2-1 victory over Sydney FC on Saturday. With three minutes gone, the England midfielder's long cross was met by Ely Allen, who scored with a crisp left-foot volley. Sydney FC equalised three minutes before halftime through Brendan Renaud, who let fly with a left-foot strike from 30 yards to beat goalkeeper Steve Cronin. "It is always good at pre-season to get games in," said Beckham. "You can do all the training you want but your match fitness that comes from games is important." Beckham provided the spark for what would be the Galaxy's winner just before halftime. His low cross was fumbled by Sydney goalkeeper Ivan Necevski, and Josh Tudela was on hand to turn the ball into the net. "The right foot seems to be working," Beckham added. "That is what I do, I get into positions and deliver balls that can help my team mates and the strikers. "I like having assists and tonight I was lucky enough to get two so it was a good night." Japanese side Gamba Osaka won the inaugural competition with an emphatic 6-1 win over MLS side Houston Dynamo. Brazilian striker Bare scored four goals, with Lucas and Masato Yamazaki also getting on the scoresheet. Ricardo Clark managed Houston's only goal
