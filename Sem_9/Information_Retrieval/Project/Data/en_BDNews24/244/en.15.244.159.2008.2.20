"I remember their invaluable contribution with gratitude and pay deep respects to the bright memories of them," he said. "Amar Ekushey is one of the greatest achievements of the nation. It is the symbol of our national unity." "Today we have to make independence meaningful being imbibed with the spirit of the Ekushey," he said.
