 Dhaka, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)  Security officials Friday barred international human rights lawyer William Sloan from holding a press conference at Sonargaon Hotel in Dhaka, lawyers said. Sloan, who was reportedly invited to Bangladesh by detained former prime minister Sheikh Hasina's family, was not allowed to come out of his room at Sonargaon Hotel. The police, Ansars and officers in plainclothes did not let journalists enter the hotel to cover the press conference. Some officers on duty told bdnews24.com that the "government had cancelled the press conference". In instant reaction, Barrister Shafique Ahmed and advocate Mannan Khan, counsels for Hasina, criticised the "government decision" after they came out of the hotel. But Atiqul Islam, deputy police commissioner for Ramna zone, told bdnews24.com: "I know the press conference was not held. But I don't know who did not let it happen." Also, Ramna police chief Doulat Akbar said he was not aware of any government decision. Advocate Mannan Khan said Sloan came to Bangladesh to observe the human-rights situation here. "But he was not allowed to speak and it's the violation of his democratic right." Sloan was scheduled to leave Bangladesh Saturday, Hasina's lawyers said. bd
