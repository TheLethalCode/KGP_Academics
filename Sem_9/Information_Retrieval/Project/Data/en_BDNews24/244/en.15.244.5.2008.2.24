<TITLE> North Korea's music tugs at heart, defends nation </TITLE>

 BEIJING, Feb 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gershwin and Dvorak are coming to North Korea. But it's the music created and inspired by the dynastic rulers of the communist state that truly tugs at the heartstrings of one of the world's most isolated peoples. At least, so says North Korea's propaganda machine, which has kicked into high gear ahead of an unprecedented concert by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra in Pyongyang on Tuesday. The North Korea's KCNA news agency last week reminded readers how, during the 1950-53 Korean War, its soldiers had "mowed down the US imperialist aggressors," after being inspired by such tunes as "Song of Defending Homeland" and "My Song in Trench".

Its official songbook includes "The Sea of Blood", "Let Us Hold High the Red Flag", and "A Rich Apple Harvest". Kim Il-sung and his son, the current leader Kim Jong-il, have been credited by the breathless official media for creating new musical genres, penning revolutionary operas and inspiring legions of soldiers to sing praise to them. Earlier this month, at the same venue where the New York Philharmonic will play in Pyongyang, there was a performance of the symphony called "Rich Harvest Comes to the Chongsan Plain". It had, wrote KCNA, "gay rhythms and melodies of such national musical instruments as small and big gongs well harmonised artistically with Western instruments". According to Kim Cheol-woong, once a leading pianist in North Korea who fled to the South: "North Korean music is not pure music but a political tool to brainwash people and praise the two Kim
