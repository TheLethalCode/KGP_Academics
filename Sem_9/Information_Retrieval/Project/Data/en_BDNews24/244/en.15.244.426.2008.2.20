<TITLE> Congo rebels massacred 30 during peace talks: UN </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KINSHASA, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tutsi rebels in Congo shot, hacked and beat to death at least 30 Hutus last month while their leaders negotiated a peace settlement, United Nations investigators said. The killings, carried out by soldiers loyal to renegade General Laurent Nkunda, took place on Jan. 16 and 17 around the village of Kalonge, around 100 km (64 miles) west of Goma, capital of the violence-torn North Kivu province. At the time, a delegation representing Nkunda's National Congress for the Defence of the People (CNDP) was in Goma attending talks that would broker a ceasefire on Jan. 23 between government troops, Nkunda loyalists, and local Mai Mai militia. "It seems almost certain that it was CNDP soldiers who carried out the killings," a UN human rights team concluded in a confidential report seen by Reuters on Wednesday. "The massacre of this number of civilians is classified as a crime against humanity ... Also, given the fact that all the victims identified so far are Hutu, the incrimination of genocide should not be precluded." Nkunda could not be reached for comment, but CNDP spokesman Rene Abandi told Reuters he was not aware of the incident. According to the report, for two days CNDP soldiers occupied positions in and around Kalonge, in one instance manning a barricade along a trail leading to a grouping of villages there. Nkunda loyalists arrested passing civilians, questioned them, and if they were believed to have travelled from areas under the control of a rival Mai Mai militia, killed them. The area had been the scene of ongoing clashes between the CNDP and the Mai Mai in the weeks leading up to the killings. Nearly all the victims were men, though a one-year-old baby, a 14-year-old boy, and a woman were also killed. "The victims were killed by gunshot, machetes, and hammer blows to the head," the report said. "That victims were arrested, tied up, beaten and shot at close range, some literally hunted down in their fields, suggests that the killings were deliberate," it said. Some 450,000 North Kivu residents fled fighting between government troops, Nkunda loyalists, Rwandan Hutu rebels, and Mai Mai in the year leading up to last month's peace deal. The conflict, which has its roots in neighbouring Rwanda's 1994 genocide in which around 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were slaughtered, has raged on despite the official end to Congo's broader 1998-2003 w
