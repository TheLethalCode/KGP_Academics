 Rohan Ziad bdnews24.com Business Correspondent Dhaka, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka stocks witnessed falling indices and slumping turnover through the past week as the market was short of funds despite regulatory moves to inject more money. Market watchers cited merchant banks' cautious stance on issuing loans as part of the reason for a slowdown. "As the merchant banks were overcautious about giving loans to clients, investors sold off shares at lower prices to invest in new," Dhaka Stock Exchange chief executive Salahuddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com. The Securities and Exchange Commission came up with a series of measures to pour funds into the market as direct listings of state-owned Jamuna and Meghna oil companies caused a huge outflow of funds from the market. On Jan 30, the regulator withdrew the restrictions on financial adjustment or netting facility it imposed on July 30 last year as excess liquidity had overheated the market. The decision effective from Feb 3 enabled investors to buy shares with the money gained from selling other shares the same day. Earlier with the restriction in force, an investor had to wait three days after trading to buy other shares. Farhad Ahmed, executive director of the market watchdog, said lack of liquidity in the market led to the move. On Jan 30, investors took to the streets demanding regulatory interventions to stabilise the market that slumped as the DSE general index at some point in trade fell about 51 points. The SEC however denied any connection between the two incidents. On Feb 3, the SEC reset the margin loan ratio for merchant banks at 1:1 taking a U-turn on its Nov 15, 2007's ratio at 1:0.5a decision taken on the same old groundsmarket overheating, that is. But the following weeks showed that the latest initiative did not work out as expected by market participants, after merchant banks became overcautious about issuing loans let alone disbursing at the ratio ceiling of 1:1. Some market analysts lauded the merchant banks' attitude. A top official of a brokerage house said merchant banks had acted responsibly. "Our investors will usually act on rumours in such a situation which would create more instability," the official told bdnews24.com. The past week saw four trading days as Feb 21 was a public holiday. Dhaka Stock Exchange's turnover amounted to Tk 6.53 billion from Tk 10.70 billion the previous week. Daily average turnover slipped to Tk 1.63 billion from the last week's 2.14 billion. The benchmark DGEN or general index opened on 2969.70 Sunday and fell 129.48 points or 4.36 percent over the week to close at 2840.22 Wednesday. The DSI or all share price index was at 2400.98 on the week's closing day, falling 110.87 points or 4.03 percent from the opening day's 2501.85. The bourse's blue chip DSE-20 closed at 2294.88 Wednesday, down 48.16 points or 2.06 percent from Sunday's 2343.04. Market capitalisation also cut 3.25 percent from the opening day's Tk 810.846 billion to Tk 784.475 on the last trading day. The week's most talked-about issue was the Securities and Exchange Commission's fine of Tk 10 crore on AB Bank. The SEC slapped the fine on Arab Bangladesh Bank's merchant banking unit on charges of approving loans to clients, mostly relatives and employees, far exceeding the permitted limit. AB Bank was also accused of skewing the market situation by creating artificial price hikes in certain issues, according to the SEC. bdn
