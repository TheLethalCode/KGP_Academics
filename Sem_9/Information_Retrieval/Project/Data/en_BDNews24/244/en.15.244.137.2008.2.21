 NEW YORK, Feb 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil vaulted to a record over $101 a barrel on Wednesday as OPEC supply concerns and hedge fund buying countered worries about the US economy. US crude ended up 73 cents at $100.74 barrel, the top settlement on record, after hitting an all-time high of $101.32 a barrel earlier in the day. London Brent settled 14 cents lower at $98.42 a barrel. The gains extended a record rally that sent crude to $100.10 on Tuesday, on expectations the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will hold output levels steady or even reduce them when it meets next month. Analysts said a rush of buying by funds seeking a hedge against inflation helped push oil to new highs, with further support coming from supply uncertainty from OPEC members Nigeria and Venezuela. "Traders are going into the oil market because it's what is causing the inflation. and those assets are most likely to appreciate," said Rob Kurzatkowski, futures analyst with optionsXpress. "It has almost become a self-fulfilling prophecy with crude -- everyone is worried about inflation so they dump their money into crude oil which is causing inflation to ramp up," he said. A steady rise in U.S. consumer prices in January pointed to persistent inflation pressures despite fresh signs on Wednesday that the declining housing sector remains a drag on the economy. The U.S. Consumer Price Index, a broadly based gauge of U.S. inflation, rose a faster-than-forecast 0.4 percent for a second straight month and was up a steep 4.3 percent in the 12 months through January, a Labor Department report showed. The U.S. Federal Reserve said lowered its growth forecast for 2008 to between 1.3 percent and 2 percent due to the deepening housing contraction and tight credit. DEMAND WOES U.S. crude broke into triple digits for the first time in early January, before concerns wider that economic problems could dampen demand in the world's top consumer sent prices tumbling. "We could still go up a few more dollars, but I do not think it's onwards and upwards," said Mike Wittner, oil analyst at Societe Generale. "The US is in an economic slowdown. We don't know how deep and for how long. The oil demand concerns are still there." US retail gasoline demand last week increased slightly from the previous week ahead of a long holiday weekend, but demand was still 4.4 percent lower than a year earlier, MasterCard Advisors said on Wednesday. A Reuters poll of analysts forecast a 2.3 million barrel rise in US crude inventories in the week to Feb. 15 and a 1.1 million barrel gain in gasoline stocks. Distillates were forecast to have fallen 1.7 million barrels. Further support for prices came from US refinery problems and the row between Venezuela and Exxon Mobil over the takeover of a heavy oil project also lifted prices. The gains came alongside rallies for platinum and soybeans as commodities remained in favor among investors seeking to beat returns in other markets, such as equiti
