 LOS ANGELES, Feb 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British rock band Coldplay will release its new album through EMI Group this summer, the band's manager was quoted as saying on Thursday, a month after he threatened to withhold the record in protest of major cost-cutting by the beleaguered London label's new owners.

EMI is the smallest of the four major labels in North America, the world's largest music market, but does a bit better internationally. Its roster also includes the Rolling Stones, who have made noises about jumping ship, Kylie Minogue, and Lily Allen.
