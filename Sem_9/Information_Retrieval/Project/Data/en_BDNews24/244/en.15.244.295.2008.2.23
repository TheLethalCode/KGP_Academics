<TITLE> Boobytrap bomb explodes in Basque Country </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Madrid, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A booby-trapped bomb, thought to have been placed by Basque separatists, exploded at a radio and television transmission station in Spain's Basque country on Saturday as a police robot moved it. The explosion, which came less than two weeks before general elections in March, caused no injuries or damage when it exploded around midday outside the hilltop facility at Arnotegi, near the city of Bilbao, police said. Authorities received a warning call at 0750 GMT that ETA guerrillas had planted the bomb and it would go off at 0900 GMT, police said. The 4-5 kg (9-11 lb) bomb exploded at 1100 GMT when the police robot moved the cardboard box containing it. "It was a booby trap bomb against the police with some kind of movement activated device," said a police spokesman. The explosion appeared to be ETA's second attack in 2008 after a bomb hidden inside a backpack caused considerable damage to a courthouse in Spain's Basque region earlier this month. Spain's Socialist Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, fighting to retain office in the March 9 election, faces criticism over failed ETA peace talks and has launched a crackdown on the Basque separatist rebels and their allies. ETA has killed more than 800 people during its four decade campaign for an independent Basque state. The most recent deaths were in December, when ETA guerrillas shot dead two undercover Spanish policemen in southern France.
