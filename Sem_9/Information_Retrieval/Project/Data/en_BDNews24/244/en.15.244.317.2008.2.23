 Ehsanul Haque Ahmed Dipu Dhaka, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com) - The government has suspended five engineers of the Roads and Highways Department earlier this month on charges of corruption linked to the Dhaka bypass construction project, a senior official told bdnews24.com in a recent interview. A total of 37 employees of the Roads and Highways Department have so far been suspended on charges of corruption since March 2007. Communications secretary Mahbubur Rahman told bdnews24.com that the communications ministry has begun the process of penalising 31 other officials of the department, including an additional chief engineer. The engineers who were suspended earlier this month are executive engineer of Dhaka region Nazmul Haq, deputy divisional engineer AKM Azad and three deputy assistant engineers Emdadul Haq, Mohammad Ali and Kazi Nazrul Islam. The communications secretary said actions were taken against them on the basis of specific allegations. "The accused will have scope to defend," he said. He also said there was no reason for honest officials to be worried. An official of the ministry said the BNP-led alliance government implemented the Dhaka bypass road project (Debgram-Madanpur-Bhulta) at a cost of approximately Tk 300 crore to ease traffic congestion in the capital city. But many parts of the road fell into disrepair shortly after it was opened to traffic. The present caretaker government formed a five-member committee to look into the matter that found irregularities in the project implementation and charged 40 officials of the Roads and Highways Department with corruption. Joint secretary of the communications ministry (development) Md Tajul Islam headed the committee. A sub-committee consisting of experts from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology had also been assigned to examine the technical aspects of the road's construction. According to the report, the committee checked at 26 points of the road and found that construction materials were not used on the road as per the conditions of the tender. The bill was paid to the contractors without verification, according to the report. The report further alleged that 40 officials connected to the project were directly involved in corruption. The communication ministry official said the file to dismiss an additional chief engineer awaited approval from higher authorities. Files have also been sent to the chief adviser for approval to sue three superintendent engineers. The establishment ministry was also asked to take action against two deputy secretaries for their links to corruption. In addition to this, the communications ministry asked the Roads and Highways Department to take action against 25 of its staff. Action could not be taken against four other officials involved in the project for the time being as they are now retired. The government had earlier suspended 22 employees of the department including two executive engineers and four deputy divisional engineers for links to corruption while collecting toll money on the Tongi-Ashulia road. Twenty-five others faced punishment for neglect of duty. Apart from this, an additional chief engineer, a superintendent engineer, two executive engineers and three other officials were suspended after police caught them red-handed distributing bribe money. Two superintendent engineers and an executive engineer had earlier been suspended on charge of corruption. bdnews24.c
