 BERLIN, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The prime minister of Liechtenstein dismissed German criticism of the tiny alpine country's financial policies as misguided ahead of a Wednesday meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Liechtenstein has come under fire in Germany after prosecutors announced last week they were investigating hundreds of people suspected of evading taxes by parking money in secret bank accounts in the principality. Since the investigation came to light, German politicians have said tax havens like Liechtenstein have no place in Europe and vowed to press for changes to its secretive banking rules. Writing in the Financial Times, Prime Minister Otmar Hasler defended Liechtenstein's record and said the tax-evasion probe was a matter for German authorities, not his country. "I am convinced that accusations levelled in the heat of the moment against the financial location of Liechtenstein are completely out of place," Hasler wrote. "In recent years, we have made great efforts to bring to justice criminals who are guilty of money laundering, the financing of terrorist acts and corruption." Liechtenstein, a tiny slice of land between Switzerland and Austria, whose economy is heavily dependent on the financial sector, is one of only three countries on the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) black list of uncooperative tax havens, alongside Andorra and Monaco. Merkel and German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck are expected to press Hasler for better cooperation and more transparency on cross-border tax issues when they meet on Wednesday in Berlin. Merkel and Hasler are scheduled to hold a joint news conference at 4 p.m. (1500 GMT). Liechtenstein's Crown Prince Alois was sharply critical of Germany on Tuesday, suggesting Berlin broke laws by paying an informant over 4 million euros ($5.89 million) for stolen bank data that has formed the basis of the nationwide probe. The investigation has led to the resignation of Deutsche Post Chief Executive Klaus Zumwinkel and threatens to claim other high-profile victims. In the FT, Hasler also questioned whether it was legitimate for Germany to "aid and abet criminal activities". "We cannot yet foresee the consequences of such actions, but we do not rule out the possibility of copycat acts that would have tremendously harmful consequences for us and for other countries' legal orders," he wrote. Separately, German business daily Handelsblatt, without citing its sources, reported on Wednesday that Liechtenstein had asked a number of German legal teams and academics to compile a report for them that would prove Germany's purchase of the evidence on suspected tax dodgers was illegal. In a document leaked to several German newspapers, the Berlin finance ministry went on the attack, blaming the principality for facilitating tax evasion. "As a financial location, Liechtenstein offers the typical conditions that enable non-residents to evade taxes in their home country without any great risk," the document re
