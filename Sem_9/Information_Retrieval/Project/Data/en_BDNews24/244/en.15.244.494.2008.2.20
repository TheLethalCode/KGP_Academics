 NAIROBI, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kenya's opposition threatened to resume street protests in a week if talks led by Kofi Annan fail to end a post-election crisis that has killed more than 1,000 people and tarnished the country's reputation for stability. Kenyans and world powers alike have called on President Mwai Kibaki and opposition leader Raila Odinga to agree a deal to halt turmoil that has also displaced 300,000. Odinga's Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) is demanding constitutional changes creating a powerful post of prime minister for their man -- something Kibaki's Party of National Unity (PNU) has looked unlikely to concede. As anxiety over the delays grew, the opposition accused the government of not being a "serious partner" in the talks, and of using stalling tactics to cement its hold on power. "The ODM proposes that parliament be summoned within the next one week to enact the necessary changes in the constitution to implement these mediation proposals," said ODM secretary-general Anyang' Nyong'o. "If that does not happen ODM will resume peaceful mass action." Previous opposition protests after the vote brought mayhem and deaths to Kenyan cities as demonstrators battled police. The chaos has caused massive damage to the region's largest economy. The opposition accuses Kibaki's team of stealing victory at the Dec. 27 polls. Kibaki's side says it won fairly and accuses ODM of instigating tribal violence following the final results. The government team is resisting calls by U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, chief mediator Annan and other western nations to allow a power-sharing deal or "grand coalition". CONSTITUTION DEBATE On Tuesday, Kibaki said he was "willing to work together and share responsibilities in government" with ODM, but that any deal "must be in tandem with the current Kenyan constitution". The government's insistence on sticking to the constitution -- a colonial-era treaty which all sides agree is long overdue for reform -- could block any special new arrangement to accommodate ODM like a premier's post for Odinga, analysts say. Nyong'o accused PNU hardliners of zealously defending the country's "imperial presidency" at the expense of Kenyans. Many Kenyans fear a return to bloodshed if a final deal is not struck soon, and local media say gangs in some conflict-hit areas have been re-arming with crude weapons. The United Nations has also warned of looming food shortages as the unrest affected crop planting, particularly the Rift Valley where about half of Kenya's cereals are grown. A deadline set by former UN boss Annan for a political deal by mid-February has passed, despite a trip last week to a secluded safari lodge to focus minds. But the Ghanaian has vowed he will stay until the talks reach an "irreversible" point. The delays at the negotiations have irked many Kenyans. "The hardening of positions by both sides -- obviously due to the high stakes in the event the deal is sealed -- promises a longer and more torturous path to a compromise," local columnist Jackson Mwalulu wrote in the Daily Nation. "The PNU and ODM negotiating teams have so far succeeded in making a complicated job nearly impossible. From outside looking in, it is more about egos and sibling rivalries. Each side is too careful not to be seen to have been the first one to blin
