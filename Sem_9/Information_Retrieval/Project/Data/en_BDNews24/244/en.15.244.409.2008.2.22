 Dhaka, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com)  Double strikes from Shahadat Hossain and Mohammad Rafique helped the Tigers gain some honour against South Africa on the first day of the two Test series opener at Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium Friday. Hosts Bangladesh reduced South Africa to 76 for four at the close of Day 1 after being bundled out for 192 in 54.4 overs in the first innings. Trailing by 116 runs, Ashwell Prince (9) and Johan Botha (5) resume the second day Saturday. Shahadat struck an early blow to remove both openers Neil McKenzie (5) and Graeme Smith (10) leaving the visitors at 19 for two in 5.3 overs before Rafique made two hits just before close. Hashim Amla and Jacques Kallis tried to repair the damage but left-arm spinner Mohammad Rafique broke the 35-run partnership between them trapping Amal lbw for 25. Then, Rafique dismissed Kallis, who never got out against Bangladesh in Test matches, for 17. The 37-year-old Rafique returned two for 29, four wickets shy of his 100-Test scalps while Shahadat gave away 17 runs in return of two wickets. Earlier, put in to bat first, an insipid batting display saw Bangladesh folded at 192 just after the tea break as Morne Morkel produced his best test figure of five for 50. Pacer Dale Steyn made the inroads into the hosts batting line-up while Morkel and Johan Botha wrecked the middle and late orders. Aftab Ahmed and Shakib Al Hasan produced some resistance in the middle after Bangladesh were reduced to 82 for five before lunch, but their fight didn't take the Tigers beyond the 200-mark. Aftab showed enough nerve to have played an uncharacteristic 84-ball 44 before losing his concentration to drive off-spinner Johan Botha to Makhaya Ntini at mid-off, ending a courageous 70-run partnership with Shakib Al Hasan. Five balls later, Shakib (30 off 69) returned to the dressing room, giving a catch to AB de Villiers at the second slip off Morkel, who in the next delivery trapped Mohammad Rafique for a first-ball duck. The Tigers went on the back foot after opener Tamim Iqbal spooned the second ball of the match, via his pad, back to Steyn, who in his second over removed warn-up match's centurion Junaed Siddique for 1. Keeper Mark Boucher took Juaned with a flying catch to draw level with Adam Gilchrist as the wicketkeeper with the most dismissals. Then, Morkel had Habibul Bashar caught by Neil McKenzie at third slip for 11 before having Shahriar Nafees also caught by Graeme Smith at first slip for 25, leaving the hosts at 60/4. Skipper Mohammad Ashraful drove Botha for two successive fours before giving a return low catch in the next ball to the same bowler for 34 off 27 balls that included seven boundaries. Steyn bowled Mashrafee Bin Mortaza for a 42-ball 29 to wrap Bangladesh's first innings up, and returned three for 27. Morkel was the peak of the attack with five for five while Botha took two for 57. bdn
