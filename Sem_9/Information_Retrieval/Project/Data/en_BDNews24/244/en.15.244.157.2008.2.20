<TITLE> Jan tax bonanza gives UK's Darling budget boost </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bumper tax receipts helped Britain's public finances notch up a record monthly surplus in January, providing a timely boost for embattled finance minister Alistair Darling ahead of his inaugural Budget next month. Wednesday's surprisingly strong figures follow months of dismal news about public finances and mean the government is back with a fighting chance of hitting its full-year borrowing target. Darling will deliver his first Budget on March 12. His reputation has recently been bruised by the crisis at mortgage lender Northern Rock and accusations of a climbdown on his capital gains tax proposals. "Like the US cavalry in a 1950s Western today's public finance figures arrived in the nick of time to get the Chancellor out of a tight spot on his borrowing forecasts ahead of the Budget," said John Hawksworth at consultancy PWC. The Office for National Statistics said the public sector posted a net cash repayment of 22.118 billion pounds last month, more than two billion pounds higher than analysts had forecast. The government's preferred accruals-based measure recorded a surplus of 14.138 billion pounds. This was more than four billion pounds above forecast. January is traditionally a prime month for tax receipts but both measures were the highest since records began in 1984 and 1993 respectively. CHALLENGES AHEAD Despite January's windfall, government borrowing for the fiscal year to date is running six billion pounds above the total for the same point in 2007. A slowing economy will create additional headwinds. Weaker profits growth will hit corporation tax receipts, softer retail sales will hurt value-added tax and a housing market downturn will severly curb revenues from stamp duty. With the liabilities of the newly-nationalised Northern Rock bank coming onto the government's books in the coming months, the government's target of keeping net debt below 40 percent of gross domestic product is bound to be missed. A downward revision to estimates for public spending in the first nine months of the year also flattered the figures. The Office for National Statistics now reckons public borrowing over the period was three billion pounds lower than initially thought. "The slowdown we are currently witnessing is likely to place further stress on the public finances going forward at a time when previous economic strength should have already led to a lower deficit," said George Buckley, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank. Adam Chester, at Bank of Scotland agreed: "It doesn't get them out of the hole but it's a slight reprieve for now." Corporation tax receipts gave a major boost to the total, up one-fifth on the previous January. Self-assessment income tax and national insurance contributions were also higher. In his pre-Budget report in October, Darling raised its borrowing projection for the current fiscal year to 38 billion pounds. The government's forecast last March had been 34 billion pounds, With two months of the fiscal year to go, government borrowing is running at 26.5 billion pounds. However February and March are typically deficit months for the public finances calend
