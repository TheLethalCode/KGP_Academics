 MANILA, Feb 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Philippine soldiers hiked through a remote central province on Thursday to deliver food, water and clothes to thousands of evacuees after raging flood waters drowned 14 people and forced whole communities to flee. Days of rain triggered the flooding in Eastern Samar, submerging roads and destroying bridges, making the remote rural province even more difficult to traverse. "If the weather permits us, we're using helicopters to bring the relief goods," Lieutenant-General Pedrito Cadungog, head of the air force, told reporters after he dispatched a C-130 Hercules transport plane.

Days of rains inundated rice fields and washed away wooden bridges, causing damage estimated at 500 million pesos ($12.2 million). Separately, on the southern island of Mindanao, six people were killed in a landslide in Lanao del Norte province, burying several houses and destroying two small bridges late on Wednesday. The weather bureau predicted more rains in the coming days because of an area of low pressure. Landslides and floods are common in the Philippines, which is lashed by about 20 typhoons each year. Environmental groups blame illegal logging for making flooding worse, particularly in the central Philippines, where more than 5,000 people died in 1991 in floods triggered by a typhoon. In February 2006, about 1,000 people were buried alive when a a mudslide from a barren mountain covered a farming village on a central isla
