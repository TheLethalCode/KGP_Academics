 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com Telecoms Correspondent Dhaka, Feb 21 (bdnews24.com)M&H Telecom and Getco Telecommunications Thursday clinched two licences to install long-distance telephony infrastructure, known as interconnection exchanges. The firms that beat 26 other competitors in a marathon open bidding agreed to pay Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission 65.75 percent of their revenue earnings. BTRC organised the auction at Radisson Water Garden Hotel, which continued from 10:00am Wednesday to 8:30am Thursday. ICXs carry phone calls from international gateways (IGWs) to landline and mobile users. As the bidding ended, BTRC chairman Manzurul Alam said: "A new era has just started in the telecommunication sector through awarding IGW and ICX licences. A level-playing field will be available to all telecom operators from now." The final call for bidding was answered by M&H Telecom, offering a 65.75 percent share of revenues. Getco, the second highest bidder, capped the race by increasing its offer to equal 65.75 percent. The ICXs will be set up in the private sector in addition to the existing ICX of state-owned Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board. Each of the two operators will be able to set up three interconnection exchanges, according to the regulatory and licensing guidelines. Two exchanges will be located in Dhaka and one will be in Chittagong, Khulna, Sylhet and Bogra each. Earlier, on Tuesday, the BTRC sold three international gateway licences to the private companies to carry overseas calls in and out of Bangladesh, ending BTTB's monopoly over internet telephony. The commission invited bids in October 2007 for the ICX licences from Bangladeshi enterprises under the International Long Distance Telecommunication Services Policy 2007, which bars the existing telecoms licence holders and foreign firms from taking part in the bidding. Wednesday's bidding took off with an offer to share 20 percent of total revenues with the BTRC. The commission has also fixed Tk 5 crore in acquisition fees for each exchange licence initially for 15 years. The interconnection exchanges will have connections to international gateways and all access network service operators must interconnect through the exchanges. bdnews24.com
