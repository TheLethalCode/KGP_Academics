<TEXT>
 Baghdad, Feb 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The head of Iraq's national journalists' union was seriously wounded when gunmen opened fire on his car on Saturday, relatives and colleagues said. Shihab al-Tamimi, 74, was shot in the face, chest and shoulder in the Baghdad attack. Tamimi is an independent journalist working for many local newspapers. He is known for his outspoken views against the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and the continued presence of U.S. troops on Iraqi soil. He is also a stern critic of Iraq's sectarian violence. "This was an assassination attempt," his nephew, who gave his name only as Alaa, told Reuters at the hospital where Tamimi was being treated. "He was going to a meeting. A car pulled up beside his and opened fire." Tamimi's 25-year-old son, who was driving the car, was also wounded. Reuters TV footage showed Tamimi lying in a hospital bed with multiple bandages but still conscious. "He is a well-known personality," said Muaid al-Lami, Tamimi's deputy in the union. "But I can't think of anyone who would be trying to target him -- it was just gunmen." The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists has called the Iraq war the deadliest conflict for journalists in recent history, with 126 journalists and 50 support workers killed since 2003.
