 YEREVAN, Feb 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Armenia will send police to tackle opposition protests over this week's presidential election if they step outside the law, the man declared winner of the vote told Reuters in an interview. Thousands of protesters were expected to gather in the capital on Friday for a third day to complain the election, won by Prime Minister Serzh Sarksyan, was rigged. They say they will keep up their protests until a new vote is called. "I don't think it's a lawful demand," Sarksyan told Reuters in an interview late on Thursday. "We have had a positive assessment from international observers and foreign embassies." "We'll need to persuade them (the protesters) not to violate law and order, not to violate others' rights," 53-year-old Sarksyan said.

Kocharyan and Sarksyan are both natives of Nagorno-Karabakh, a region over which Armenia and neighbouring Azerbaijan fought a war in the 1990s. Some analysts say the still-unresolved conflict could flare again into violence. During the war, Turkey closed its border with Armenia and froze diplomatic relations in solidarity with Turkic-speaking Azerbaijan. Relations have still not been restored, and are also complicated by the massacres of Armenians by Ottoman Turks during World War One. Turkey strongly denies Armenian declarations that the killings were genocide. "I've declared many times that Armenia is ready to establish diplomatic relations with Turkey without any preconditions," Sarksyan said. Turkish president Abdullah Gul congratulated Sarksyan this week on his election win and said he hoped for an improvement in relations between their countri
