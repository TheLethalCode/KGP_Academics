 LONDON, Feb 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Arsenal must become the first English club to beat AC Milan in European competition at San Siro or else force a score draw to qualify directly for the quarter-finals of the Champions League. They could, of course, draw 0-0 again and take their chances on penalties but, whatever the outcome, the European champions will start the second leg of their first knockout round tie on March 4 as the favourites to reach the last eight. Milan have played 11 home matches against English clubs in European competition since 1958, winning seven and drawing four. Arsenal have never been eliminated from Europe by an Italian club and won 5-1 on their last visit to San Siro in November 2003 against Inter Milan who share the ground. No knockout round tie has ended goalless since the Champions League format was introduced in 1992-93 and on Wednesday's evidence goals are likely in the second leg. Arsenal played some excellent football but failed to capitalise on their home advantage at The Emirates. Arsenal created most of the chances in an entertaining game and almost stole victory in the fourth minute of stoppage time when Emmanuel Adebayor headed against the bar. EXCELLENT RESULT Milan skipper Paolo Maldini, 39, said the result was an excellent one for his side who are seeking a sixth successive appearance in the quarter-finals. "In my experience a 0-0 draw away from home is a good result in Europe," he told reporters after the game. "The fact they went for broke in the last five minutes to get a goal suggests to me they thought a 0-0 draw was not the best result for them. "We now have the big advantage of playing at home in the second leg." However, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger claimed he was not entirely dissatisfied with the outcome either. "0-0 is not a bad result at home in the first leg. I didn't dream of 0-0 but not conceding a goal means it is not a bad result," said the Frenchman. Italian media felt Milan's dogged defence had given the European champions the edge in the tie with the headline "Milan's London Wall" in the Gazzetta dello Sport. The paper emphasised how important Adebayor heading against the bar seconds from the end could be. Maldini, playing the 1,001st match of his professional career, was also lauded for his performance, which could be his last match abroad before he retires at the end of the season. The English media suggested Arsenal now had it all to do. "Wenger faces a struggle at San Siro as Milan defence stifles Gunners," wrote the Daily Mail. The Daily Mirror said: "Edgy Arsenal need miracle in Italy to make it into last eight
