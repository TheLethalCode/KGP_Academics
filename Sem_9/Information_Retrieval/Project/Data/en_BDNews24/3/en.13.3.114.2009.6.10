<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com)A spokesperson for private television channel ATN Bangla has said the company owns the property at 69 Gulshan Avenue, which armed intruders broke into in the early hours of Wednesday morning to try and forcibly evict an octogenarian couple from their decades-old home. Saiful Bari, chief adviser to ATN Bangla, told bdnews24.com the 21-katha plot was bought for Tk 2.25 crore in March this year. Chairman of the TV station Mahfuzur Rahman purchased the land from Abdur Rashid Khan on ATN Bangla's behalf, Bari said. "The number of the plot is CWOS (A) 13. However, RAJUK has changed the number. Rashid has taken the house as lease from the RAJUK and it has not been handed over to him (Rashid) as well." He showed this correspondent a money receipt of RAJUK as proof that Rashid owned the plot. "But no one from ATN Bangla tried to illegally grab the house; those who did so are not associated with ATN Bangla," said Bari. He said a signboard seized by police bearing ATN Bangla's name was not theirs. Asked why they bought the land whose ownership had been disputed, Bari said most of the lands had complications over ownership. Even though Bari claimed that Rashid himself had not been handed over the house, the land documents say Rashid had been living in that house without any receiving claims from others about the ownership. He had also been paying annual tax and utility bills. Bari said the 21-katha plot was bought at Tk 2.25 crore, but according to current market price each katha of land in Gulshan area costs around Tk 2 crore Armed intruders, claiming to be from the private TV station, sought to forcibly occupy the valuable Gulshan Avenue property. The gang broke into the home of retired civil servant Abdul Qaiyum at around 1:30am and tried to overpower the night guards, but faced stiff resistance from neighbours' security men. Qaiyum, who began his civil service career in the colonial era, retired as chairman of BIWTA in the Pakistan days and is widely respected among neighbours. A number of neighbours alleged police complicity in the whole affair. "They were refusing to arrest the 11 already tied up by the guards," alleged one. "And when my son called the OC, the officer was clearly reluctant to respond, pretending he did not know where the place of occurrence could be," the neighbour said. "This is absolutely unacceptable ... how can this happen in the middle of the night? And on Gulshan Avenue?" fumed another neighbour, who saw at the first hand much of what followed the abortive bid to oust the helpless couple. "This is daylight robbery in the middle of the night," a Qaiyum relative said. Police arrested 11 of the assailants, but at least four managed to escape. A number of witnesses said police appeared "reluctant to respond". Qaiyum's nephew Ruhul Quader told bdnews24.com the attackers had entered the house by breaking down the doors. But four of the raiders were detained by guards from the house next door, belonging businessman Abdul Awal Mintoo, a former FBCCI president. The other seven were overpowered inside Qaiyum's house compound. The eighty-seven year old Qaiyum said: "We bought this house and have been living in it since 1970. How could this happen?" Salman F Rahman, former FBCCI president and Qaiyum's relative, went to the scene after he was informed of the incident. The Qaiyum family said a general diary had already been registered with the Gulshan police by ATN Bangla, which claimed the house belonged to the TV station. "The attackers came with a huge signboard," said a neighbour. The board, still propped up in the driveway hours later, read: 'ATN Bangla have bought and own this plot 3WS(A)69'. Detainees remanded A metropolitan magistrate gave Gulshan police two days to question the 11 detainees. Investigation officer Jahangir Alam Mondal asked for seven-day remand. Metropolitan magistrate Munshi Abdul Majid rejected their bail petitions. The case statement seems to be shrouded in mystery, Majid said. Defence lawyers advocates AKM Sohrab, Rafiqul Islam Ripon, Golam Sarwar said in the hearing that the case had been filed upon a heated argument over non-payment of house rent. The bail petition claimed the prime accused in the case was the nephew of the "house owner", who had an altercation with the plaintiff over the payment of house rent as the latter had not paid overdue rent for long. How it all happened Shafiqul Islam, a guard of the house of Qaiyum, told bdnews24.com that a few people knocked at the main gate while two to three men got over the wall, held him hostage and opened the gate. Some eight to 10 armed people with black clothes wrapped around their faces got down inside the house complex from a microbus, which had no number plate, Shafiqul said. Qaiyum's domestic help Razia Begum said that assailants were armed with rods, hockey sticks, machetes, knives and firearms. The intruders took Qaiyum to the microbus and also tried to take his wife out of the house. They vandalised the furniture of the house, she said. Ruhul Quader, a relative of the Qaiyums, said as neighbours came out, the intruders tried to flee. Seven of them were arrested from Qaiyum's house and four others from Abdul Awal Mintu's house. Ruhul said the ATN Bangla authorities filed a general diary with Gulshan Police Station a few days back, claiming that the house belonged to the TV station. Harun-Or-Rashid, assistant police commissioner of Gulshan Zone, said the ATN Bangla chairman, Mahfuzur Rahman, claimed the house to be his and mentioned Quaiyum as tenant in the diary. Ruhul said police officers 'Sharif' and Hasan Mahmud from Gulshan Police Station had came to the house two to three days back and said Qaiyum was not the owner but a tenant. They wanted to talk with Qaiyum. The arrestees are Kabir Chowdhury, Ashraful Ari, Saifur Rahman, Sujan, Mokhtar, Nazmul, Sohel, Azim, Shahidul Islam, Rashedul Islam and Shahin. bdnews24
