 Dhaka, June 14 (bdnews24.com)Mohammadpur police arrested three suspected bullet-hit muggers early on Sunday from Rayer Bazaar in the capital. As many as 23 people have so far been injured and two killed in one month since May 13 in alleged 'shootouts' with police in the capital. Shahjahan Kabir, Mohammadpur police chief, said a police patrol challenged passengers cruising around suspiciously in a black cab in Rayer Bazaar Boddhyobhumi (killing ground) area at 4am on Sunday. At that, the taxi passengers opened fire and police retaliated, he added. Two or three miscreants managed to escape the scene. Police arrested injured cab driver Lutfar Rahman, 45, Mahbubur Rahman, 40, and Noor Hossain, 40, with bullet injuries from the spot and seized the cab and sharp weapons. Police filed a case against the three. The injured were admitted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. In another incident, one Bachchu Mia, 40, a security guard of a house on Sher Shah Shuri Road, was shot and injured. Sub-inspector Kaiser Ahmed said some youths knocked at the doors of 73 Sher Shah Shuri Road, looking for a man named Monir. As Bachchu did not let them in, an altercation followed and the strangers shot the guard in both legs. The injured Bachchu has been admitted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. Miscreants have so far shot and killed a cable TV connection provider and injured another four by spraying bullets in June in Mohammadpur. bd
