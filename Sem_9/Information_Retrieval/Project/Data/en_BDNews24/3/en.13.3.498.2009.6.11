 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com)Subsidy for fertiliser has been reduced to Tk. 3,600 crore from Tk 5,785 crore in the proposed budget whereas the government has set a target to increase the agricultural loan to Tk 10,000 crore. Finance minister AMA Muhith said in his budget speech on Thursday that Tk. 4,285 crore had been allocated in the budget of FY 2008-09 for subsidy for fertiliser and other agricultural inputs to help the farmers. "Due to abnormal price hike of urea and non-urea fertiliser in the international market around that time, the amount of subsidy was raised by Tk 1,500 crore to Tk 5,785 crore for keeping the market price at an affordable level for the farmers." Recently, the price level has come down to a third of that in the international market. "Against this backdrop, I propose to allocate Tk 3,600 crore as subsidy in this sector for the next fiscal year," he said. Muhith said in FY 2008-09 the target was to distribute Tk 9,379 crore in farm loan and until March Tk 6,907 crore had been disbursement, which was 73.6 percent of the target. In the next fiscal year, the government plans to increase the target of agricultural loan from Tk 9,379 crore to Tk 10,000 crore and continue loan programmes at specially reduced rate of interest in the hill districts. "Our economy is agro-based. We have, therefore, given highest priority to overall agriculture and rural development sector. "The contribution of our agriculture sector to the economy is 22 percent of GDP and 48 percent of our labour force is engaged in this sector," minister said. He added that the government planned several steps for increasing food production. "These include expansion of irrigation facility using surface water in southern areas, addressing water logging in the south-western region, expanding cultivable land by improving drainage system in the haor areas and by creating opportunities for multiple-cropping. "I propose to allocate Tk 4,000 crore for FY 2009-10 to implement these projects." "To increase crop production in FY 2009-10, we have taken seven programmes and six projects for developing high yielding variety seeds at a cost of Tk 280 crore, to be implemented by BADC and Agricultural Extension Department." The minister proposed allocation of Tk 185.21 crore for agricultural research and agricultural rehabilitation assistance for maintaining the growth of crop production. The proceeds from investment of Agriculture Research Endowment Fund, created in FY 2007-08, will be used for agriculture research. "I propose to allocate Tk. 5,965 crore, development and non-development combined, for the Ministry of Agriculture in FY 2009-10." "We have a plan to provide incentives to 12,000 farmers for increasing milk and meat production. We have also a plan to establish farms for lambs and buffaloes. To implement these programmes, the budget allocated Tk 716 crore combining development and non-development budget, which is 19 percent higher than the revised budget of the current year.
