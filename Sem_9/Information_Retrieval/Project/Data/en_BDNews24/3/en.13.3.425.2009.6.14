<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 14 (bdnews24.com)Stock market leaders have praised the budget proposed for the next fiscal year, saying no other budget attached so much importance to the capital market. "The finance minister in his budget speech emphasised raising funds from the capital market rather than opting for syndication loans from commercial banks," Dhaka Stock Exchange president Rakibur Rahman told a press briefing on Sunday. He also lauded the government's move for an extended three-year amnesty to draw 'black money' into the capital market, start-up industries and physical infrastructure. "The decision is very encouraging...it would strengthen the capital market leading to a faster industrialisation of the country." On scathing criticism made by some economists and experts on the budget provision of the legalising undisclosed money, the DSE chief said that the "specialists" missed the main point. "It is an conditional offer upon investment...its not like paying 7.5 percent tax and whitening money like the previous time," he said. Rakibur urged undisclosed money holders to invest and "sleep peacefully". The Chittagong Stock Exchange also welcomed the budget. CSE president Nasiruddin Ahmed Chowdhury said in a statement that the move to update the taxation system and forming of a National Tax Tribunal is "commendable". He suggested raising tax-free income limit for private service holders to Tk 2 lakh to offset the effects of high commodity prices in the wake of pay hike of government employees beginning July 1, when the 2009-10 fiscal year starts. Both the stock exchange leaders however, asked for a revision of the rate of turnover tax for stock brokers. Finance minister AMA Muhith proposed the turnover tax at 0.025 percent from existing 0.015 percent. They also urged the government to cut the corporate tax rate for bank, insurance and financial institutions.
