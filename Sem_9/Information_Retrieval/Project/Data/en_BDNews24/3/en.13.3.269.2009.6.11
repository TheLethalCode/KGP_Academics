 JOHANNESBURG, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand's coach has warned the side's Confederations Cup opposition against taking them lightly after the All Whites scored three goals in a narrow defeat to Italy in a warm-up international on Wednesday. "We could be the dark horses in the tournament, who knows?" Ricki Herbert told reporters after New Zealand led three times against the world champions before succumbing 4-3 in Pretoria. Herbert, who played for New Zealand at the 1982 World Cup finals in Spain, described his side as "a young team with lots of self belief". "I was very proud of the way we played and to get a hat-trick of goals against a team of Italy's pedigree was superb. We now go into the tournament with a real degree of confidence," he said. Ranked 82nd in the world, New Zealand open their Confederations Cup campaign against European champions Spain in Rustenburg on Sunday. Hosts South Africa and Asian champions Iraq are the other teams in Group A. "Our agenda at the tournament was to finally get a point or a win, but to get to the semi-finals is now a realistic dream," Herbert added. "We also want to keep the momentum going for the World Cup qualifying play-off matches we have coming up at the end of the year.
