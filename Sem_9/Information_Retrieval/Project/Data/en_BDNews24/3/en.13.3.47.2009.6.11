 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com) Parliament on Wednesday extended the controversial speedy trial law for two years. The Law and Order Infringement (Speedy Trial) (Amendment) Bill 2009 and Public Procurement (Amendment) Bill 2006 are the first two laws passed in the current budget session. Main opposition BNP did not join the session on its fifth day. Home minister Sahara Khatun tabled the speedy trial bill in March to keep the law in force until April 6 2010 to combat crimes such as mugging, extortion, terrorism and vandalism in the streets. The BNP-led government introduced the law in 2002, with provision for extension every two years, amid protest by then the opposition Awami League. This is the fifth time the law has seen its term extended, including one through an ordinance by the 2007-08 caretaker government. The government said a total of 159 cases were under investigation and 1,246 others on trial under the law up to Mar 3, 2009. Planning minister AK Khandaker placed the Public Procurement (Amendment) Bill 2009 in the House on Mar 29. Telecommunications minister Raziuddin Ahmed Razu presented the annual report of Bangladesh Telecommunications Regulatory Commission for 2007-2008 fiscal years before the passage of the bills. Speaker Abdul Hamid adjourned the session until 3.30pm on Thursday. bd
