<TITLE> Continued SIM tax a barrier to growth: AMTOB </TITLE>

 Dhaka, June 14 (bdnews24.com)  Mobile telecom operators have expressed disappointment over the continuation of the Tk. 800 SIM tax, saying growth projection for the industry, in the proposed budget for FY2009-2010, would remain a "paper projection". They also said keeping the telecom tax goes against the government's vision of a Digital Bangladesh. 'Barrier to growth' SIM tax is seen to be the biggest barrier to the growth of the mobile phone industry, the Association of Mobile Telephone Operators, Bangladesh said at a press conference Sunday. AMTOB president Zakiul Islam said mobile operators had so far invested more than Tk 30,000 crore in building countrywide networks. "We fear that with the SIM tax in place, future investment in the sector will suffer." "This is particularly true because new customers are from low income groups, and there is no business case for the operators to continue subsidising the SIM tax, since each new customer brings low revenue," he said. The association chief said mobile-specific taxes levied on customers, such as the SIM tax, had been fully subsidised by the mobile operators for the customers from 2006 to 2008 in the interest of growth. "However, growth almost ceased after operators removed the subsidy from late last year to avoid further losses." Odver Hesjedal, CEO of GrameenPhone, said SIM should be removed as telcos were going for greater coverage in rural areas. Telecom taxes in India were the lowest, and growth in that country the highest, in South Asia, he added. Muneer Faruki, CEO of Warid, the newest entrant in the market, said he feared smaller operators might have to "pack their bags and quit". 'Paper projection' The operators point out that the projected revenue from SIM tax, shown in the budget, will remain as a "projection on paper", while the reality is that the government's revenue from SIM tax has declined by 65 percent between Q1 '08 and Q1 '09, to Tk 147 crore from Tk 426 crore. A survey by mobile operators shows that withdrawal of SIM tax will result in higher market penetration to reach 56.5 percent of total population in 5 years and will yield Tk 5,000 crore revenue for the government by 2013. On the other hand, if SIM tax continues, penetration will not cross 37 percent and the dream of a Digital Bangladesh will never be met, said AMTOB. The association hoped that government would withdraw the SIM tax to support continued growth of the industry.
