 TEHRAN, Sun Jun 14, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iranian police again clashed on Sunday with demonstrators protesting in Tehran against the re-election of hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Supporters of defeated moderate Mirhossein Mousavi, who has dismissed Ahmadinejad's victory in Friday's election as a "dangerous charade," gathered in the city center, chanted his name and threw stones at police, a Reuters witness said. Police on motorcycles drove through the crowd to disperse the protesters. At least one person, a woman, was injured. Police briefly detained journalists filming the violence. The unrest that has rocked Tehran and several other cities since official results were declared on Saturday is the sharpest expression of discontent against Iran's leadership for years. Police have detained more than 100 reformers, including the brother of former President Mohammad Khatami, a leading reformer said on Sunday. A police official confirmed some detentions. Ahmadinejad was planning celebrations in the capital later on Sunday. His unexpectedly overwhelming victory and its violent aftermath raised fresh questions about how Iran will respond to U.S. President Barack Obama's diplomatic overtures. Analysts said the election result would disappoint Western powers trying to convince the world's fifth biggest oil exporter to halt nuclear activities they suspect are aimed at making bombs. Obama had urged Iran's leadership "to unclench its fist." FRENCH CONCERN French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner voiced concern about events in Iran after the election, saying "brutal" repression of opponents was closing the door to dialogue. "Brutality and never-ending military development will not bring any solutions," Kouchner said after meeting US special envoy to the Middle East George Mitchell in Paris. Mohammad Ali Abtahi, who served as a vice president under Khatami, told Reuters the former president's brother Mohammad Reza Khatami was one of more than 100 members of Iran's biggest reformist party Mosharekat who were held on Saturday. "There are reports a political party was involved in yesterday's incidents. Some of them have been arrested," Iran's deputy police chief Ahmed Reza Radan was quoted by the Fars news agency as saying. He said Khatami was not among 10 people arrested, but did not say if he had been summoned and released. Mousavi's wife, Zahra Rahnavard, denied reports that her husband himself had been detained or put under house arrest. "He is following the issue of the election. He says he is with the people and beside them," Rahnavard told Reuters. "The Iranian people voted to change Ahmadinejad, but this vote became a vote to solidify Ahmadinejad. People are tired of dictatorship," said Rahnavard, who took a high-profile public role in her husband's election campaign, which drew tens of thousands of supporters onto the streets of Tehran. "People are tired of not having freedom of expression, of high inflation, and adventurism in foreign relations. That is why they wanted to change Ahmadinejad," she said. An aide to Rahnavard said she had tried to speak at Tehran University on Sunday, but had been prevented. Mousavi has rejected Ahmadinejad's victory, saying it had been achieved by vote-rigging that would "jeopardize the pillars of the Islamic Republic and will establish tyranny." Interior Ministry officials have rejected accusations of fraud and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's top authority, has called on Iranians to back their president. POWER STRUGGLE The anti-Ahmadinejad camp was "taken by surprise and is scrambling for a plan," according to Trita Parsi, director of the Washington-based National Iranian American Council. "Increasingly, given their failure to get Khamenei to intervene, their only option seems to be to directly challenge -- or threaten to challenge -- the supreme leader," he wrote. A senior Western diplomat in Tehran said he believed the street unrest would soon end. "It will not be allowed to spread. They will apply all their force to subdue it," he said. But while Ahmadinejad had won, his re-election battle had exposed a polarizing power struggle between radicals and moderate conservatives which in the long term could affect the Islamic Republic's stability, the diplomat said. "There is turbulence in the whole system," he added. Protests also broke out on Saturday in the cities of Tabriz, Orumieh, Hamedan and Rasht, where crowds chanted for Mousavi. In Isfahan, police made arrests after students at Sanati University set equipment and furniture on fire, a witness said. In Tehran, municipality spokesman Mohammad Hadi Ayazi said protesters had torched seven buses on Saturday, destroyed 60 rubbish bins and set several banks on fire. Ahmadinejad, in a televised address to the nation, said the election had been "free and healthy." US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States was monitoring the outcome of the election closely and hoped the result reflected the will of the Iranian people. A senior State Department official insisted Obama's decision to engage Iran was not based on any particular electoral outcome and the path ahead would be hard no matter who
