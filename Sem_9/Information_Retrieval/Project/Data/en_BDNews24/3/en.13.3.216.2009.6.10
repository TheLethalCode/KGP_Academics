<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com)The government is set to invite bids soon for the Dhaka metro rail project to ease traffic snarls in the capital, the communications minister said on Wednesday. "The dream of a metro rail has been unrealised for too long," Syed Abul Hossain told reporters after a ministry meeting. "Today's meeting has decided to invite tenders as soon as possible. The ministry will form a committee to finalise the terms of the tender, he said. The proposal on forming the committee will be placed for approval within seven days at the cabinet committee on economic affairs. "On approval, the committee will finalise terms and conditions and be set to invite tender," said the minister. Hossain said bidding would be invited for the complete works including feasibility. The bidder would eventually hand over the charge to the government, he said. In reply to a query on another major proposed transport system for the capital, the minister said the government would initiate both the metro rail and elevated expressway "simultaneously." The minister chaired the meeting, attended by cabinet secretary Abdul Aziz, roads and railways secretary ASM Ali Kabir, members of the planning commission, and representatives of ministries and department concerned. bdn
