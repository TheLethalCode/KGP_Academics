<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 14 (bdnews24.com) - Water resources minister Ramesh Chandra Sen has said a joint survey by India and Bangladesh will determine the full impact of the Tipaimukh dam project. "The Indian government has said that no water will be permanently diverted or withdrawn through the Tipaimukh dam, which is a hydropower project," said Sen, replying to questions in parliament on Sunday. "A survey will determine whether the project will cast any negative impact on Bangladesh," said Sen in answer to a written query by BNP MP Shahid Uddin Chowdhury Anny. Steps have been taken to undertake the joint survey according to 14th meeting of India-Bangladesh Joint River Commission in January 1978, he said. "It will determine whether flooding can be controlled in Bangladesh and other benefits reaped through this project," he said. In answering to a separate question, from Workers Party of Bangladesh president Rashed Khan Menon, he said the government has decided to send a parliamentary team to visit the Tipaimukh Dam site in India. The next step on the issue will be taken after the committee submits a report, said Sen. Trial of War crimes The government will file the cases against alleged war criminals, under its own initiative, the law minister said, replying to a query from Awami League MP Muhibur Rahman Manik. The cases will be filed under the International Crimes (Tribunals) Act 1973 on the basis of the investigating agencies' reports, Shafiq Ahmed said. Appointment of ombudsman The government has plans to appoint an ombudsman to establish rule of law in the country, Shafiq said. The ombudsman will be appointed in line with recommendations from parliament, he said, in answer to a query from Jatiya Party MP AK Moinul Islam. bdnew
