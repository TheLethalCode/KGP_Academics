 Dhaka, June 13 (bdnews24.com)An all-party parliamentary panel recommended raising the retirement age of lower court judges to 60 years from present 57. The sub-committee, formed by the parliamentary standing committee on law ministry, also recommended a pay hike for judges of the lower court. "After discussion, all members have agreed that the retirement age of the lower court judges should be 60 years," Suranjit Sengupta, the standing committee chairman, told bdnews24.com after a meeting on Saturday. This is first parliamentary move to increase the retirement age of over 1,000 judges of the lower court. The five-member sub-committee was formed on June 7 with former law minister Abdul Matin Khasru at its head. It submitted its recommendations to the main committee at its meeting on Saturday. "They also favoured raising the judges' salaries considering the country's socio-economic conditions," Abdul Matin Khasru told bdnews24.com. "We have only proposed the pay hike, the government will fix it as per the final recommendations of the standing committee," he said. State minister for law Quamrul Islam, BNP's Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury, and Awami League MPs Fazle Noor Taposh and Nurul Islam Sunjon are the other members of the sub-committee.
