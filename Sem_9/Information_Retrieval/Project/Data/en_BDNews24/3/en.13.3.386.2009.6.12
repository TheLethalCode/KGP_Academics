 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com)A smoking tube light caused panic at parliament on Thursday after its budget session ended. Fire fighters rushed into the Sangsad building as panicked people called the stand-by fire brigade to extinguish the 'fire'. "There was no fire," Kazi Emdadul Haq, parliament's security chief, told bdnews24.com. "Some people called the fire fighters saying there was a fire in the building."
