<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 14 (bdnews24.com)  Senior US official Robert O Blake has said his country will assist Bangladesh in the trial of war criminals and safeguarding border areas. "The US supports our efforts to try war criminals and will extend assistance in this regard," home minister Sahara Khatun told reporters after a half-hour meeting with Blake, US assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian affairs. US ambassador James F Moriarty also attended the meeting. "We informed [Blake] that we are committed to the interests of the people in trying war criminals," said Sahara. "If countries like the US and UK say do your work, we support you', it is a big support for us," she said. On what kind of assistance US might offer in protecting frontiers, Sahara said: "We do need their assistance for the protection of our border areas. The foreign ministry can explain further." Asked whether Bangladesh faced any problem with border security, the home minister avoided a direct reply. Blake arrived on Saturday afternoon on a two-day visit, his first to Bangladesh since succeeding Richard A Boucher in May. Demands from civil society for the trial of those who committed crimes against humanity, during Bangladesh's war of independence from Pakistan, have gathered momentum in recent years. The Awami League-led government, coming to power in January, is now taking steps to hold trials with the international community voicing support. The exact number of people killed by the then occupying Pakistan army and their collaborators in Bangladesh is not known, though most estimates put the figure at around three million. According to some reports, an estimated 200,000 women were raped during the bloody nine-month war in 1971. To date, no one has been brought to justice for these crimes. bdnew
