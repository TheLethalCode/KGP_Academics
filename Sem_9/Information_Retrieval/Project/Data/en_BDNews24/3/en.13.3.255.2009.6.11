<TEXT>
 PRETORIA, South Africa, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World champions Italy had to come from behind three times to beat New Zealand 4-3 in a breathless warm-up for the Confederations Cup on Wednesday. Vicenzo Iaquinta struck twice in the second half to spare Italian blushes against the 82nd-ranked team in world football. Italy started with an experimental line-up but were stunned into bringing on more established players to turn things around. Shane Smeltz opened the scoring for New Zealand in the 13th minute before Alberto Gilardino headed in Fabio Quagliarella's chip for the first equaliser. Chris Killen headed in from a corner for 2-1 before Gilardino got his second. Killen won and converted a penalty in the 57th minute as New Zealand again took the lead and that prompted Marcello Lippi to send on five more experienced players in quick succession. Iaquinta's first came after a defence-splitting pass from Andrea Pirlo and the second when he reacted fastest after New Zealand goalkeeper Glen Moss had failed to hold Riccardo Montolivo's shot. New Zealand play their first game of the Confederations Cup against European champions Spain on Sunday in Group A while Italy's opener is against the United States in Group B on Monday
