 Dhaka, June 14 (bdnews24.com)  The reward money offered for information leading to capture of border guards, who remain fugitive following the BDR mutiny in February, has been doubled to Tk 1 lakh, a home ministry spokesperson said on Sunday. "The information provider will be given Tk 1 lakh and his identity will be kept secret," home ministry public relation officer Md Shahenur Mia Shahin told bdnews24.com. The home ministry originally announced a reward of Tk 50,000 in April. Thousands of border guards, guilty and innocent among them, fled the Peelkhana headquarters in the chaos of the bloody Feb 25-26 mutiny that left at least 70 people dead, mostly army officers deputed to the border force. Many also fled battalions and camps after unrest in other parts of the country. While most ranks reported back to duty in the days that followed, authorities launched 'Operation Rebel Hunt' to round up an estimated 1,000 who were still on the run in March. Most of the fugitives were arrested or surrendered in the following weeks, while lists of those still missing have been sent to police stations, airports and border posts, say officials. BDR authorities published its latest list last month, of 25 BDR men that were still fugitive up to May 19. On May 24, however, the family of Sepoy Md Abdus Samad of 44 Rifles Battalion, one of those listed, said he was already in jail. A case was filed on Feb 28, in the wake of the mutiny, accusing over a thousand BDR men. Over 1,100 border guards have been arrested to date in connection with the case. bd
