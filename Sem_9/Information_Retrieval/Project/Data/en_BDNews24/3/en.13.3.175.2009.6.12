 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com)The proposed budget for FY 2009-10 has allocated an additional Tk 124 crore for expanding rationing facilities for law-enforcing agencies and fire service. "Alongside helping the law enforcing agencies enhance their professional skills, the aspects of their needs and security also come up quite relevantly," finance minister AMA Muhith said in his budget speech on Thursday. "We've already increased the rationing facilities for the 1, 91, 780 members of our police, ansars and VDP, fire service and civil defence and national security intelligence directorate." "The government incurs an additional expenditure of Tk 124 crore on that account alone." The finance minister said realistic reforms are a requirement to raise a professional law and order enforcers' army who'll be above all influence and intimidation. The government is mulling over a board based on people's representation to supervise and oversee such reforms needed for the purpose, he added, allocating Tk 5, 801 crore to the home ministry at the same time. The minister informed the parliament that the war crimes trial will be ensured and appropriate measures were also being taken to tackle the Islamist militants and other extremist elements. The trial of the murderers of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the four national leaders will also be completed as soon as possible, he said. Muhith said the government will not tolerate any extra-judicial killings and ensure judicial enquiries into all such unwarranted incidents. The government is reviewing the Supreme Court verdict on the fifth amendment to the constitution and considering amending the constitution based on the present deliberations. b
