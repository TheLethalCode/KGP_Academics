<TEXT>
 PUERTO ORDAZ, Venezuela, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Uruguay dropped out of the qualifying places in the South American World Cup qualifying group after they were held to a 2-2 draw in Venezuela on Wednesday. Diego Forlan ended a spell of Uruguayan pressure by putting the visitors 2-1 up in the 73rd minute, but Venezuela kept their hopes of a first World Cup appearance alive when Jose Manuel Rey scored from a trademark free kick two minutes later. Uruguay, on 18 points from 14 games, dropped to sixth in the 10-team group, two behind Ecuador. Venezuela have 17 points. The top four qualify directly for South Africa while the fifth has a two-leg playoff against the fourth-placed team from CONCACAF. Venezuela took an early lead when Tomas Rincon flicked a deft pass through a square Uruguay defence and found Giancarlo Maldonado, who clipped the ball over Juan Castillo. However, the hosts failed to build on their lead and Uruguay took control, Luis Suarez testing Renny Vega with a 20-metre shot and hitting the crossbar shortly afterwards with another effort from outside the area. Uruguay deservedly equalised on the hour when Cristian Rodriguez fed Suarez and his shot slipped through Vega's arms. Forlan struck from close range in the 73rd minute after Sebastian Abreu headed Diego Perez's cross into his path, but the lead last only two minutes as Rey equalised with a free kick. Forlan was twice deprived a late winner for the frustrated visitors
