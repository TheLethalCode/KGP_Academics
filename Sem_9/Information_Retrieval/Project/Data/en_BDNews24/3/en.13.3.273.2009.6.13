 Dhaka, June 13 (bdnews24.com)  Law minister Shafiq Ahmed Saturday called on public prosecutors to take up 'alternative dispute resolution' to tackle the massive backlog of cases jamming the courts. "Many countries have alternative means of resolving cases out of court," Shafiq said at a daylong training for PPs at the Justice Administration Training Centre. "We should introduce such a system to free the courts through quick disposal of thousands of unresolved cases." He also criticised the delays caused by lawyers seeking time extensions. Many of the thousands of pending cases can be resolved quickly by two means, firstly by not seeking time extensions and lengthy adjournments, and secondly by settling them through alternative means," the minister said. Alternative settlements can be applied in both criminal and civil cases, he added. Public prosecutors must be up-to-date about the changing face of crime and new laws, he said. "State lawyers should play a better role in discharging their duties by knowing and presenting all the required information and arguments on behalf of the government," he said. Meanwhile, public prosecutor Abdul Mannan voiced concern, which he said many shared, by the appointment of "too many PPs". "There is not enough office space or desks," he said. "There used to be 35 PPs, generals prosecutors, additional PPs and assistant PPs in Dhaka. The number is now 98," he said. "Eighteen new appointments were made in place of three additional PPs," Mannan said. The law minister said those appointments were made in line with recommendations from lawyers, "not for any other reason". "The government is moving to solve the problem of space. You will see a quick solution," Shafiq added. bdnews
