 Dhaka, June 7 (bdnews24.com)  The conditioning camp of the national booters in a bid to raise their power and stamina has been deferred by six days and will now get underway on June 21 instead of June 15 in Cox's Bazar. "We have deferred the camp by six days because of the unavailability of the BKSP dormitory as well as few players' participation in the Champions Club Cup," said BFF vice-president Badal Roy on Thursday. He added that after three weeks' camp in Cox's Bazar the players were supposed to get training at the BKSP, but the BKSP dormitory would be available after June 15. Bangladesh's Brazilian coach Edson Silva Dido has already picked 30 players for the SAFF Championship in December as well as the 2010 South Asian Games. bd
