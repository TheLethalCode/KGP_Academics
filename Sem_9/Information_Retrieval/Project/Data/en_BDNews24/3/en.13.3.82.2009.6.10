 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com)Police on Wednesday arrested two BNP activists in connection with the shooting of a youth by Union Parishad chairman Monir Hossain in Kamrangirchar the previous day, but the chairman was still absconding. Mawla Reza, a local Swechchhasebak League, filed a case with Kamrangirchar police on Tuesday night accusing 18 people, including the UP chairman and his two brothers, of murder, vandalism and looting, police said. Kamrangirchar police chief Nazrul Islam named the two arrestees as 'Hashu' and Nazimuddin. "The search is going on for Monir Hossain," said Nazrul Police were deployed at the chairman's house, he added. The Sultanganj UP chairman fired shots at a crowd of angry protestors in Kamrangirchar on Tuesday, killing 18 year-old woodworker Hasan Mia. Mahfuzur Rahman, a fellow woodshop worker, said Hasan received a bullet in the chest as the chairman opened fire at the mob in the middle of a heated dispute. Hasan was rushed to Mitford Hospital around 3pm where the duty doctor declared him dead, said Mahfuz. Witnesses told bdnews24.com that a group of locals, protesting about the expansion of a local road, had surrounded the UP chairman in his car at Lohar Bridge. The protestors mobbed the car as Monir was trying to drive away, they said. After the shooting, Monir managed to flee, but hundreds of furious locals went on to attack his Ashrafabad residence. The mob set fire to his garage, burning a second vehicle belonging to the chairmanan SUV. Lalbagh Zone fire brigade's senior officer Manikuzzaman said firefighters rushed to the spot to extinguish the blaze, bringing it under control at around 3.30pm. Family members claimed Monir, a local BNP leader, was "forced to fire" with "a licensed gun" at local Awami League leaders who "attacked him". Local Awami League leaders said they had not attacked or provoked him in any way. AL leaders and supporters in the area were only gathering at Lohar Bridge for a meeting, Kamal Hossain Shipon, joint secretary of AL's Kamrangirchar unit, told bdnews24.com. Sonia Akhtar Maya, wife of the UP chairman's younger brother, claimed local AL leaders and activists had attacked his car so he shot at them to escape. He fled the scene by car to save his life, she said. bdnews2
