 By John Mehaffey LONDON, June 12 (Reuters) - Sri Lanka showed off the depth and versatility of their bowling on Friday when they beat Pakistan by 19 runs in their opening Twenty20 World Cup second round match at Lord's. Defending a modest total of 150, Sri Lanka reduced Pakistan to 36 for three after six overs. Pakistan captain Younus Khan and Misbah-ul-Haq gave their side a flicker of hope with a composed partnership of 66 from 10 overs before the latter was caught for 21 at mid-wicket off Muttiah Muralitharan. Shahid Afridi fell in identical fashion off the next ball and Younus's dismissal for 50 in the following over effectively ended Pakistan's hopes. They finished their 20 overs on 131 for nine. Sri Lanka opened their bowling with Angelo Mathews and Nuwan Kulasekera before unveiling their big three of Malinga, Muralitharan and Ajantha Mendis. Mathews bowled Salman Butt for a duck with his third ball, finishing with a respectable one for 23 off his four overs. Malinga was the pick of the bowlers, taking three for 17. Pakistan had made an awful start after losing the toss when Sohail Tanvir conceded 18 runs from an 11-ball over which contained three wides and two no-balls. Sanath Jayasuriya (26) and Tillakaratne Dilshan (46) prospered from some further erratic bowling by stroking 65 from the first six overs with Jayasuriya hitting the first six of the match, swivelling on one leg to pull the ball over the boundary. But after reaching 86 for one off the first 10 overs, Sri Lanka added only 64 in the second half of the innings as the Pakistan spinners Afridi, Shoaib Malik and Saeed Ajmal put a brake on the scoring. Afridi, who took four for 11 against the Netherlands in the first round, was again the pick of the bowlers with two for 23 with his quick leg-spin
