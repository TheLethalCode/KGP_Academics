 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com)The provision for 'whitening black money' in the proposed budget is a discouragement for genuine taxpayers, a top BIDS researcher said on Thursday. "The government should not have extended the offer to whiten black money as it undermines the confidence of real taxpayers," BIDS research director Zaid Bakht said. "They may be deterred from paying taxes." Finance minister AMA Muhith, in his budget speech in the day, proposed an unprecedented three-year amnesty to draw black money into the mainstream economy. "No questions will be asked" on source of funds provided a flat-rate 10 percent tax is paid and the money is invested in one of 42 sectors from July 1 2009 to June 30, 2012, said the finance minister. A similar "no questions asked" policy is also offered to home buyers in the new budget. Such schemes have been offered in the past, but only for months at a time. In the lead up to the budget, analysts on the whole as opposed to the business communityhad been critical of such amnesties for tax dodgers, on both ethical and practical grounds. The finance minister in his budget speech said the facility was being given to boost investment, employment and to create more homeowners. There are many potential sectors of our economy where investments could carry forward our efforts for change," said Muhith, in a preamble to the proposed three-year amnesty. Says Bakht: "Some shareholders may be benefited if the secondary market sees a boost but it will not foster industry." "The size of the budget also holds major challenges. Though the budget projects huge revenue earnings, revenue collection will undoubtedly face limitations," he said. On the annual development programme, he said, "We always have problems in implementing ADP." "We failed to utilise Tk 20,000 crore under the ADP in the outgoing fiscal year, while the proposed budget has allocated Tk 30,000 crore for the same programme," said Bakht. Terming it an "expansionary" budget, he said: "The main objectives of the proposed budget are to fulfill electoral pledges and overcome the onslaught of global recession." bdnew
