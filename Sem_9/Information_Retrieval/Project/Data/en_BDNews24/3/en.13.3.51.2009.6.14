 Dhaka, June 14 (bdnews24.com) - Peul Smriti Sangsad of Jhenidah bounced back in the Bashundhara Champions Club Cup football tournament with a massive 5-0 win over Youngmens Club Fakirerpool of Dhaka in Group B match at the Shamsul Huda Stadium in Jessore on Sunday. Peul Smriti, who went down 6-1 against Feni Soccer Club in the group opener, enjoyed superior ball possession throughout the game that resulted in a 3-0 lead in the first half with Khaled opening the account in the 13th minute. Four minutes later Ujjal doubled the margin and Ripon made it 3-0 in the 30th minute. Khaled struck his second and team's fourth in the 60th minute before Jahirul sealed the match in stoppage time. Despite their massive win in their second and final match, Peul Smriti have a little chance to make it into the semi-finals as the Jhenidah outfit will have to wait for the outcome of Fakirerpool and Feni Soccer Club, who just need a draw in their group final match to see them in the last four. Away at Cox's Bazar, Shuktara Jubo Sangsad of Narayanganj made a winning start after thrashing Chittagong Mohammedan SC (Blues) 3-0 in the Group C opener. Khokon gave Shuktara a 14th minute lead before Monir Hossain struck twice in the 52nd and 68th minute to ensure all the points. bd
