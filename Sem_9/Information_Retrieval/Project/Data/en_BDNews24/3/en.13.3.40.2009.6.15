 Dhaka, Jun 15 (bdnews24.com)General Moeen U Ahmed retired on Monday after four years as army chief, spending his last days in office in relatively low-key fashion. "I've tried to give my best despite many limitations," said the general, widely perceived to be a key player in the '1/11 changeover' in 2007, which entailed a state of emergency and formation of a caretaker government that went on to rule for an unprecedented two years. "The people will judge my actions," Moeen told TV reporters on Sunday, after meeting president Zillur Rahman at Bangabhaban. Asked how he would pass his time in retirement, the man who was considered by many to be the 'de facto' ruler of the country for two years, said he wanted to keep working in some capacity. "I'm certain that I want to take up a job in the future, but I have yet to decide what kind of job," he said. Moeen, who was repeatedly forced to deny the possibility of an army takeover during the two turbulent emergency years, also took leave of prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Sunday. Hasina's government took over in January from the so-called 'military-installed' caretakers, under whose regime her party won a landslide election and Bangladesh saw what is considered to be the freest and fairest elections in the country's history. Just weeks after coming to power Hasina, with Moeen, faced the horror of the BDR mutiny in which scores of army officers were killed. Moeen U Ahmed was appointed chief of army staff on June 15 2005. His term was extended by another year in 2008. He was previously attached to the diplomatic mission in Pakistan as a Defence Attache, and prior to that served as a UN Peacekeeper in Rwanda. He was the first army chief from among the officers commissioned in independent Bangladesh and the first serving officer to become a four-star general after the liberation war. Gen Mubeen takes up the mantle Monday Lt Gen Md Abdul Mubeen, who succeeds Gen Moeen as army chief, will be promoted to general as he takes up his new office on Monday. A former GOC in Jessore and Chittagong, Mubeen was made Principal Staff Officer to the Armed Forces Division on June 4 2008, in a major reshuffle of top army posts. He came to public notice with a well-received televised statement on the night of Feb 27 to clarify that the government's announcement of a 'general amnesty' during the Feb 25-26 BDR mutiny did not mean that those involved in killings, arson and other crimes would go unpunished. Mubeen also served as the coordinator of the national coordination committee against corruption during the caretaker government's anti-graft drive against top politicians and businessmen. bdn
