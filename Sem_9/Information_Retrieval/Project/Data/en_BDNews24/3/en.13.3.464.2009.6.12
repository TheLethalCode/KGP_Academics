<TEXT>
 ROME, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The purchase of Kaka and massive bid for Cristiano Ronaldo will not lead to Real Madrid being burdened by a huge amount of debt, new president Florentino Perez was quoted as saying on Friday. Real were given permission to negotiate with Ronaldo after Manchester United accepted a world record bid of 80 million pounds ($131.2 million) for the Portugal winger on Thursday. Three days earlier, Brazil playmaker Kaka joined the Spanish giants from AC Milan for a fee reported to be around 67 million euros. "On the contrary, we think can improve our accounts by aiming for three goals," construction magnate Perez was quoted as saying by Friday's La Gazzetta dello Sport when asked about the debt issue. "Increasing ticket sales, increasing bank loans and increasing the club's economic value". He added that Real generated enough revenue to cover these massive transfer market investments, with more expected to come, without him having to use his own funds. "(The money) is exclusively the club's, not mine," said Perez, who twice broke the transfer record in taking "galacticos" Zinedine Zidane and Figo to the Bernabeu in his previous stint as president from 2000-06. "Real Madrid takes about 400 million (euros) a year, the fruit of three sources of incomea third from ticket sales, a third from television rights and a third from merchandising." ($1 = 0.605 pounds
