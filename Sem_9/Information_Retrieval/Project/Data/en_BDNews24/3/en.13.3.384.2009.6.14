 Dhaka, June 14 (bdnews24.com)  A 13-member committee is being formed by the government to monitor the printing and distribution of free textbooks at the primary and secondary level. The committee, to be headed by Prof Md Akhtaruzzaman of Islamic history at the Dhaka University, will consist of educationists, journalists and administrative officials, said an order of the education ministry on Sunday. The committee will be able to co-opt more members if needed and will give financial and secretarial assistance to the National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB). To resolve the crisis of textbooks, the NCTB has started its work with the target to finish printing within October, said the ministry. Prof Akhtaruzzaman said on Sunday that he was yet to be notified formally. "I will start work after getting an official letter and according to the committee's jurisdiction," he said. An earlier committee was formed, also led by Prof Akhtaruzzaman, to ensure the timely distribution of textbooks for lower secondary (class six to eight) and secondary (class nine to ten) students. The committee submitted a report to the education minister recommending distribution of textbooks free of cost. The government made the decision to do so a few days ago. On Thursday, finance minister AMA Muhith proposed a Tk 300 crore-allocation for the measure. He also said that new books would be given to all at primary level from next year. At present, new textbooks are given up to class three and students of class four and five are given both new and used books. Others in the 13-member committee are Prof Syed Manjurul Islam of the English Department of Dhaka University; director of secondary and higher education directorate; director of the technical education directorate; Prof Aziz Ahmed Chowdhury, former director of primary education; a representative of the Dhaka divisional commissioner (of deputy commissioner rank); additional director of RAB (operations); chairman of inter-education coordination board sub-committee; chairman of Madrasa Board. They also include Prof Kofil Uddin Ahmed, former chairman of NCTB, news editor of ATN Bangla Manzurul Ahsan Bulbul; Md Abul Kashem Bhuiyan, deputy secretary for primary and mass education; Md Alefuddin, deputy secretary for education. b
