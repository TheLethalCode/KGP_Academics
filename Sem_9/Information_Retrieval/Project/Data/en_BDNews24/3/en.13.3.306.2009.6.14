 JOHANNESBURG, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa have no injury worries and are all set to "get the party started" when they face Asian champions Iraq in the opening match of the Confederations Cup, coach Joel Santana said on Saturday. The 61-year-old Brazilian told an eve-of-match news conference at Ellis Park stadium that all his players were fit and despite picking up a knock in training on Saturday, playmaker Teko Modise would face Iraq in their opening Group A match. "We had a few knocks and bruises this morning, but nothing serious," he said. "We are now ready and want to start this party as soon as possible. We know there are great expectations on us because we are the hosts, but we are optimistic we can do well and start with a good performance against Iraq." Aaron Mokoena, South Africa's skipper, said he was beginning to detect the start of a "new vibe" in the country with the imminent start of the eight-team tournament, the test event ahead of next year's World Cup finals. "We feel that mood already, Mokoena said. "For us players it is so encouraging to do know that so many people are coming to the game and driving to training, you can really see that the vibe is starting and the mood is there." He also felt that South African president Jacob Zuma's presence at the squad's training session on Saturday had galvanised the players. "The fact the president was there made our day, to be honest," Mokoena said. "I remember a couple of months ago he came to watch our game against Equatorial Guinea and his being there was an extra boost for us. That he took time from his busy schedule this morning to come and address the players and wish us the best of luckit meant a whole lot for us. "Hopefully tomorrow we can take that into the game and come out with a victory. To have five minutes with the president meant a lot to us." South Africa need a win over Iraq as their slump in form over the years has seen attendances at national team matches decline. They have also slipped to 72nd in FIFA's world rankings. Already eliminated from next year's African Cup of Nations in Angola, South Africa will need the competitive experience of the Confederations Cup before the real thing begins next June
