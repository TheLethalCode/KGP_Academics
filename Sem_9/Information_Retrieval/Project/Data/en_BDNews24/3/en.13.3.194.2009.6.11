<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com)Tk 2100 crore has been allocated for the newest avenue of this year's budget, Public Private Partnership (PPP). Finance minister AMA Muhith in his budget speech Thursday stressed measures to attract private investment in critical infrastructure projects. "I propose to create three new 'expenditure heads' in the FY 2009-10 budget to facilitate new projects under PPP," said the finance minister. The first expenditure head named PPP Technical Assistance would see allocations of Tk 100 crore for feasibility studies and preparatory works before involving the private sector. The proposed budget sets aside another Tk 300 crore in Viability Gap Funding as subsidy or "seed money" to attract private sector spending for power plants, hospitals, schools, roads and highways which are non-profitable but essential for public services. Another Tk 2100 crore has been allocated to accelerate the process of investment through PPP by setting up an Infrastructure Investment Fund. The government would use the fund to provide equity or loan to the private investors to ensure government's participation. The finance minister added that the challenge was to set up an institution for proper of PPP allocations. "According to our plan we hope that PPP budget management will be fully operational by next September." bdnews
