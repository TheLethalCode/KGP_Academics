 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com)Fearing a slump in revenue due to falling imports, the finance minister has proposed both enhanced rates of customs duties and an expanded income tax and VAT base. Import duties alone contribute 42 percent to Bangladesh's total revenue, and a battling A M A Muhith said in his budget speech on Thursday that he would protect local industries, promote exports but at the same time slap higher rates on items that only the rich afford. He hoped to raise Tk 23,236 crore in import duties. The minister also aimed to increase receipts from Value Added Tax, now nearly a third of the total national revenue. The proposed budget targets Tk 20,735 crore from VAT. The minister has had all the reasons to be extra careful. In 2008-9, the revenuethe revised target is Tk 53,000 crorefell short of the original goal, Tk 54,500 crore. If the proposed measures get the parliamentary go-ahead, top-end mobile phones will be costlier, so will carsnew, reconditioned, old, used and air conditioners, refrigerators, luxury lamps, imported ceramic items. A 25 percent duty depending on value will replace existing flat Tk 300 for any phonecheap or expensive. An increased duty on expensive cars is designed to "discourage" import of such vehicles. "To augment revenue collection and to discourage imports of luxury vehicles, I propose to increase supplementary duty on the imports of luxury vehicles and restructuring of duty slabs," the minister told MPs. "I propose to fix the consolidated rate of depreciation at 30% for old, used and reconditioned vehicles not exceeding five years. "Dealers' commission for deduction from the value of such vehicles shall be 10% instead of existing 20%." But cars to be imported for use as taxi cabs will be spared. "To enable importation of durable and standard vehicles to be used as taxicab, I propose to attach the conditions of minimum engine capacity of 1500 CC and import of at least 10 vehicles in one consignment by any taxicab company. "I also propose to waive all customs duty in excess of 20% and all supplementary duty and regulatory duty for taxi cabs fulfilling the above conditions." Cars that consume less fuel will cost less. "In order to offer exemption from supplementary duty against import of hybrid motorcars, which is fuel efficient, I propose to create a new HS code for separate classification." Luxury items will cost more. "Government is pledge bound to discourage imports of luxury items and products detrimental to public health. In view of that, I propose to impose 5% regulatory duty against tariff lines with 25% customs duty." Cheaper basic raw material The finance minister, however, sought to make basic industrial raw materials cheaper, with proposals to reduce duty rate from seven percent to five percent. "I propose to reduce ... in order to make our local industries more competitive both in local and international market," he said. "However, other slabs of 3 percent, 12 percent and 25 percent would remain unchanged." In 2008-09, import duty structure comprised 3 percent on capital machinery and parts, seven percent on basic industrial raw materials, 12 percent on intermediate raw materials and 25 percent on finished products. Zero tariff will stay for imports of major foodgrains, seeds, fertiliser, medicine and raw cotton. "I propose to withdraw VAT on the imports of raw materials to produce pesticides to keep pesticides easily available for farmers." The minister proposed withdrawal of duties on solar panels, locally-produced generators, energy saving lamps, and ocean-going vessels. VAT to go up "VAT is the highest contributor to the domestic tax revenue. Therefore, to meet the growing demand for domestic revenue, I propose to enhance the rate of VAT to 2.25% from the existing 1.5%. Smokers will pay more, but not because the government needed more revenue. "Considering the demand from various anti-smoking campaigners including Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, I propose to increase the price slab for cigarettes and tariff value for domestic production of bidi alongside imposition of 10% supplementary duty on Zarda and Gu l. "Besides, I propose to increase the rate of supplementary duty applicable on the domestic production of beverages, polished and unpolished stones, tiles, mosaic, ceramic bathtub & jacuzzi, sink, basin, commode, bathroom fittings and impose 10% supplementary duty on local production of glass sheet. Protection for local producers Muhith sought to protect local newsprint producers, proposing to slap a five percent duty on imports for the newspaper industry. "Moreover, I propose to withdraw the VAT applicable for importation of pulp that is a virtual raw material for this industry." Similar support was suggested for many other local products. "To offer protection to the local dairy industry, I propose to impose 5% regulatory duty in addition to 12% customs duty on milk powder imported in bulk. "Our local industries are seriously hurt due to significant decline in prices in the international market. "So, to offer protection to the local industries producing footwear, ceramic tiles, tableware, sanitary ware and other ceramic items, I propose to raise supplementary duty from existing 20% to 45% and impose 20% supplementary duty on the imports of particle board, hard board, medium density fibre (MDF) board, plywood, leather goods, such as bag, suitcase, vanity bag etc., mosquito coil, imitation jewellery and corrugated cartons. "Moreover, I propose to impose 45% supplementary duty on imported tooth brush . "Similarly, to protect local biscuit factories I propose to impose 100% supplementary duty in place of existing 60%. "Besides, to prevent valuation fraud in importation of biscuits and dry cell batteries, I propose to fix tariff value on these items. "Likewise, to protect local liquid glucose , dextrose producing plants, I propose to impose 20% supplementary duty on their imports. "In Bangladesh, air-conditioners are still used by the affluent section of the society for their homes and offices. "The use of this product entails huge electricity consumption. Besides, our power generation is still lagging behind its demand. Under the circumstances, I propose to increase the supplementary duty on importation of air-conditioner to 60% from 20% and impose 45% supplementary duty on its parts. "I also propose to enhance the supplementary duty on refrigerators from 20% to 30% and increase supplementary duty on luxury light fittings and fixtures from 20% to 60%. Doctors, cancer patients to benefit The minister proposed withdrawal of VAT on doctors' fees as well as "domestic production of drugs for preventing cancer". Rural small industries, agriculture and diary will also enjoy no-VAT facility. "To protect the interest of the domestic dairy industries, I propose to withdraw 2.5% supplementary duty applicable on the processing of liquid milk to convert into powdered milk. "Moreover, to make the VAT more bearable, I propose to fix tariff value for powder milk at Tk. 100/kg. This would result in only Tk. 15/kg as VAT instead of current Tk. 50/kg. He also referred to the proposed duty increase for bulk milk powder imports "to protect this industry" and said: "I hope this should expedite the development of dairy industry. "To offer incentives for complete manufacturing units, which create more value addition and generate more employment opportunities, I propose to offer VAT exemption for the next one year for complete manufacturers of refrigerators and motorcycles . "Besides, I propose to withdraw VAT on local production of hard board . Keeping money in banks for small savers is set to be cheaper. "As an incentive to small savers, I propose to raise the threshold level for imposing excise duty on bank deposits to Tk. 20,000 instead of existing Tk. 10,000. No VAT on Internet in schools The minister proposed withdrawal of VAT on the internet services used in the educational institutions "to keep this service within the reach of students and also to signify our commitment towards Digital Bangladesh". "To promote development of good films, I propose to withdraw VAT and supplementary duty on the screening of Bangladesh made films awarded national or international prizes and films produced with the assistance of government grants." But the VAT net will catch many more areas of economic activity. "It is essential to broaden the tax base for VAT to ensure progression of this tax over time. Besides, to ensure a more equitable tax system, existing exemptions should be phased out gradually. "For this and in the interest of the revenue augmentation, I propose to bring the services of event management , human resources supply or management, inspection and certification service provision, floor space rental for commercial purposes, plants & equipment lease for any particular period under the purview of VAT. "I also propose to withdraw the VAT exemption facility enjoyed by travel agents , indenting firms , manpower exporters, manufacturers of utensils, sanitary ware and other kitchenware made of aluminium and enamel, homeopathic , ayurvedic, unani and herbal medicine and plastic furniture. Chanachur not spared! "To ensure equity among various classes of taxpayers, I propose to bring the manufacturers of lozenges, energy drinks and juice, chanachur , cosmetics, items of hair treatment ... biscuits under the purview of VAT irrespective of turnover level. The minister proposed to deploy more tax collectors throughout and upgrade some collection points. bdnews2
