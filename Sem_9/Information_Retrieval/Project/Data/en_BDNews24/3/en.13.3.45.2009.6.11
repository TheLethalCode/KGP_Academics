 NEW DELHI, Thu Jun 11, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States wants India and Pakistan to resume peace talks, but would leave it to the two countries to decide the way forward, a US official said on Thursday. "The scope and the character of that dialogue is something for Indian and Pakistani leaders to decide on how and when to approach that dialogue," Undersecretary of State William Burns told a news conference after talks with Indian leaders. India has "paused" a slow-moving peace process with Pakistan after 10 gunmen killed 166 people last November in Mumbai.

"I think we are making good progress and I am very hopeful that we will be able to get past that issue and move ahead to expand defense cooperation between us," Burns said. "So, yes I think we are closer."
