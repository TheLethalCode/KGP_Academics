 Dhaka, June 13 (bdnews24.com)  Public prosecutors, in a meeting with the law minister on Saturday, voiced concern over the appointment of "too many PPs". Dhaka PP Abdul Mannan said so many new prosecutors had been appointed by the government that there was not enough office space or desks. Many shared the concern, he said at a daylong training for public prosecutors at the Justice Administration Training Centre. "There used to be 35 PPs, general prosecutors, additional PPs and assistant PPs in Dhaka. The number is now 98," he said. "Eighteen new appointments were made in place of three additional PPs," Mannan said. Law minister Shafiq Ahmed said all those appointments were made in line with recommendations from lawyers, "not for any other reason". "The government is moving to solve the problem of space. You will see a quick solution," Shafiq added. 'Alternative dispute resolution' He also called on public prosecutors to take up 'alternative dispute resolution' to tackle the massive backlog of cases jamming the courts. "Many countries have alternative means of resolving cases out of court," said Shafiq. "We should introduce such a system to free the courts through quick disposal of thousands of unresolved cases." These cases can be resolved quickly by two means, firstly by not seeking time extensions and adjournments, and secondly by settling them through alternative means, the minister said. Alternative settlements can be applied in both criminal and civil cases, he added. Public prosecutors must be up to date about the changing faces of crime and new law. Training courses can be helpful for them, he said. "Lawyers should play a better role in discharging their duties by presenting all the required information and arguments on behalf of the government," said the minister. bdnews
