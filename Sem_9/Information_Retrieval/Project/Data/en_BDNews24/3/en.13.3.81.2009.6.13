 HALLE, Germany, June 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Huge transfer bids such as Real Madrid's world record 80 million pound offer for Cristiano Ronaldo should be kept secret to avoid adverse public reaction, leading tennis player Novak Djokovic said on Friday. Real Madrid's world record offer for Ronaldo, which has been accepted by his English club Manchester United, was described by UEFA president Michel Platini as "excessive" and "puzzling" in the current economic climate. "You can look at it from an athlete's perspective or someone who earns 2,000 euros a month," the 22-year-old Djokovic told Reuters during the Halle tournament. "In this crisis this is not the best way to show off how much money (the club) is willing to offer. "It reflects on social life very quickly, psychologically. These are incredible amounts." "There is another way of doing this," Djokovic added. "I am not saying he does or does not deserve it but the amount should not reach the media." Djokovic, the world number four, has so far earned more than $12 million in prize money alone since turning pro in 2003
