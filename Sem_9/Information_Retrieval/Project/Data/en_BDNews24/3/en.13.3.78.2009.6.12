 TEHRAN, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iranians began voting on Friday in a closely-fought presidential election pitting conservative President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad against more moderate rivals seeking better ties with the West. Voting started at 8 a.m. (11:30 p.m. EDT) in the country of 70 million people. Preliminary results are expected early on Saturday. If no clear winner emerges from Friday's vote, a run-off will be held on June 19 between the two front-runners. "Voting for the 10th presidential election started throughout the country," state radio said, referring to the number of presidential polls held since the 1979 Islamic revolution. Four candidates are standing but Ahmadinejad's strongest challenger appears to be the moderate Mirhossein Mousavi, whose supporters have paraded through Tehran in their thousands to demonstrate their backing.
