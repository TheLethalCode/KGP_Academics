<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com)Power plants with combined production of 3520 megawatts will be set up by 2014 to boost the crisis-ridden national grid, the prime minister told parliament on Wednesday. "A programme has been undertaken under short, medium and long-term plans with participation of private and public sectors," Sheikh Hasina said, speaking in a question-answer session. "Some 726 MW electricity will be available by June 2009 on short term; 900 MW by June 2012 on medium term and 1895 MW by June 2014 on longer term," she elaborated. "This power will be added to the national grid." Besides, some 45 MW electricity would be added by setting up small plants under the rural electrification board, she said. Hasina replied to nine questions of which two were written and six were supplementary. BNP was absent from the house like other days of the current budget session. Asked by Shahiduzzaman Sarkar of Naogaon about the navigability of the rivers, she said, "The government has taken up a master plan to dredge rivers to make them navigable." "A high-powered committee headed by the prime minister has been formed for the purpose." "We will go for dredging all the rivers of the country. We have discussed (the matter) with the World Bank and donor agencies." "Dredging is planned for big rivers like the Padma, Meghna and Jamuna. Rivers will get back their navigability and amounts of land will also increase as a result." She had announced on World Environment Day on June 5 that rivers would be reverted to their earlier grandeur at any cost. Replying to a supplementary of Rashed Khan Menon, she said, "To check climate change and environment, the present government is collecting money for different projects from donors without any condition." "We will not take money with condition. Besides, by creating water reservoirs in haor areas, moves will be taken for generation of electricity." The Prime minister called upon all to go for increased greening and aforestation in North Bengal to save it from desertification. Replying to a question from Majibul Huq Chunnu, she said the government has decided to take up a programme styled 'work for the absolute poor' in 480 upazilas for the year 2009-10. Under the programme, priority will be given to rickshaw-pullers in the capital and slum dwellers who want to go back to the village. The government will restart 'Go back home' programme of 1996. Hasina responded to a supplementary query of Independent MP Fazul Azim to say that vocational training institute will be set up in each upazila. "Besides, arrangements will be made to provide small loans to the unemployed under the self-employment programme." On a question from Mollah Jalauddin of Khulna she said unbridled rises in prices of essentials had been checked due to firm steps of her government. bdnew
