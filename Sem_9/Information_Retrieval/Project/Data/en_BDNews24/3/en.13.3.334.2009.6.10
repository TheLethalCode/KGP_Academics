 Abdur Rahim Harmachhi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com)Having finessed details in the past few days, finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith is all set to propose the first budget of the Grand Alliance government for fiscal year 2009-10 on Thursday, with introduction of a much-touted PPP sector in a bid to fulfill campaign pledges. The finance minister would not enlarge much on the ensuing budget on Tuesday night except that the proposed budget aimed to fulfill the government's campaign commitments and combat the impacts of the global financial crunch. "Public-private partnership is the novel aspect of the coming budget. It will be an addition to the traditional revenue and development budgets." Asked what might be the total size of the budget, Muhith said it had to be above Tk 1,00,000 crore. It should be around Tk 1, 15,000 crore as indicated by the media. In more than one pre-budget discussions, the finance minister indicated that the next budget will be an ambitious one. The budget will have to be expanded to an extent to deliver on the election pledges, enhance civil servant' pay and perks as per the Seventh Pay Commission recommendations and adopt measures to cope with the financial downturn. The total revenue expenditure in the budget exceeds Tk 82,000 crore, of which Tk 30, 500 crore in annual development programme (ADP) allocations have been finalised by the National Economic Council. The FY 2009-10 budget will have a block allocation of Tk 2, 200 crore to finance the much-discussed public-private partnership (PPP) entrepreneurial efforts. The total revenue earnings have been targeted at Tk 85, 000 crore. The size of the FY 2008-09 budget was Tk 99, 962 crore, which had a revenue earning target set at Tk 69, 382 crore (including NBR and external sectors). The minister assured all time and again in the recent past that people would not be burdened with new taxes, but the scope and limits of levying existing taxes will be further expanded. The taxation system will be made more effective to make sure none can dodge tax collectors, he added. The new budget will announce increasing the number of taxpayers from seven lakh to 10 lakh, a National Board of Revenue official said in condition of anonymity. The total number of taxpayers with TIN are over 22 lakh, of whom only seven lakh pay taxes and the number has been decided to be raised to 10 lakh. The finance minister said the number of recipients of allowances payable to aged people, freedom fighters and widows, and other social security stipends will be increased alongside enhancing the dole sizes, which should be in line with the election commitments. PPP to come Muhith said a separate controller's office needed to be set up to run the PPP initiatives. "They will be fully run by the private sector and from the private sector again a chief will be recruited." "The total project will be funded by private sector entrepreneurs." For example, Muhith said, "We can invite the private sector to be a party to build residential halls for public universities." "BIRDEM will have new hospitals in the north-western region through PPP." Tk 2,200 crore for PPP A block allocation of Tk 2, 200 crore in the new budget for the new PPP sector will be utilised to fund six projects. Four will be implemented in Dhaka, one in Chittagong and one in the coastal belt, costing an estimated Tk 76, 245 crore in total. The projects are Dhaka-Chittagong express highway, sky railway skirting Dhaka City, underground railway in the capital and the Dhaka City elevated expressway under the communications ministry, he said. The power and energy ministry project proposes the construction of two 900 megawatt coal-fired power plants and the shipping ministry eyes a deep sea-port in Chittagong. According to the finance ministry data, the cost of Dhaka-Chittagong express highway has been estimated at Tk 22, 101 crore, Dhaka City underground railway Tk 21, 390 crore, the sky railway skirting Dhaka City Tk 19, 320 crore, Dhaka City elevated expressway Tk 8, 487 crore and the two 900 megawatt coal-fired power plants in the coastal belt will together cost Tk 621 crore. The projects being colossal in dimensions, their implementation will take five to seven years, the ministry official said. Besides, construction of smaller link and approach bridges, flyovers, underpasses and tunnels, university residential halls and hospitals will be undertaken under the PPP. In the changed circumstances during military-installed Fakhruddin Ahmed-led caretaker government's regime, then the finance and planning adviser, AB Mirza Azizul Islam, had presented two budgets for the fiscal years 2007-8 and 2008-9. Earlier in 1995, professor Wahiduddin Mahmud as the finance adviser to the then caretaker government had presented the nation with an interim budget for three months.
