<TITLE> US backs probe of border guard deaths </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 14 (bdnews24.com)A senior US official has urged Bangladesh to investigate the deaths of border guards who have died in custody since the bloody BDR mutiny in February. Visiting US assistant secretary of state Robert O Blake said proper investigation into the deaths would provide the basis for "increased cooperation with Bangladesh Rifles" as they reconstitute themselves after the mutiny. "There has been a serious investigation into what occurred in the Bangladeshi Rifles. But we also discussed the deaths in custody and we talked about how it is important for the government to investigate those, to carry out a credible investigation," said Blake. A visiting European Union delegation last week also urged the government to investigate the deaths of at least 20 BDR personnel who have died in custody since the Feb 25-26 mutiny in which over 50 army officers were killed. Authorities have reported the custodial deaths as 'suicides', or being caused by 'illnesses' including 'heart attacks'. The government has said it would investigate the deaths after local media and international rights groups highlighted the issue. The visiting US official also stressed the need for investigation into 'extra-judicial killings'. The Awami League government, that took over from a two-year military-backed caretaker regime in January, has received criticism recently for what appears to be a continuation of 'crossfire' killings by security forces in the country. "In all our discussions with our friends in the government of Bangladesh, we emphasised the importance for investigating extra-judicial killings and bringing those responsible for the killings to justice," said Blake. Blake, assistant secretary for South and Central Asian affairs, met foreign minister Dipu Moni and home minister Sahara Khatun on Sunday morning and was scheduled to meet prime minister Sheikh Hasina in the evening. This is Blake's first visit to Bangladesh since succeeding Richard A Boucher in May.
