 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com)  The government has proposed Tk 217.55 crore for the development of youth and sports for the 2009-2010 fiscal which is Tk 67.45 crore less than the allocation of the 2008-09 fiscal. The amount of the 2008-09 allocation, however, decreased by Tk 179 crore in the revised budget. Finance Minister AMA Muhith on Thursday made the proposal in his budget speech in parliament. The finance minister said that the government would take all necessary initiatives to raise the current profile of the country's sports arena to an international standard and that they would like to see sports free from politics. They would take planned initiatives to extend infrastructure and training facilities. Muhith also said he proposed an allocation of Tk 217.55 crore, development and non-development combined, in next year's budget for the development of youth and sports. Most of the money will be spent for the 2010 South Asian Games in Dhaka as the Bangladesh Olympic Association has sought Tk 48 crore for hosting the meet. Besides, the National Sports Council has also sought Tk 28 crore to buy sports equipment as well as the renovation of different venues. Apart from the SA Games, the Bangladesh Football Federation president Kazi Salahuddin had also earlier met the finance minister to seek at least Tk 25 crore for youth development. In the budget speech, the finance minister said, "It is our electoral pledge to create a congenial atmosphere for the pursuit of culture across the country. We will provide financial assistance to those poor and insolvent people, who are dedicated to the pursuit of culture. We will set up public libraries everywhere to develop the reading habit of the youth and formulate an integrated policy for the supply of books to those libraries." bd
