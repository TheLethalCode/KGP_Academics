 BUENOS AIRES, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Argentina's World Cup fear of heights resurfaced on Wednesday when they lost 2-0 in Ecuador while Brazil and Chile both moved closer to a trip to South Africa with home wins. South American group leaders Brazil came from behind to beat Paraguay 2-1 in a top-of-the-table clash while surprise package Chile thumped a negative Bolivia 4-0. Argentina, who have 22 points from 14 games, stayed in the top four positions which guarantee a place in South Africa but are only two points clear of fifth-placed Ecuador after their defeat at altitude in Quito. The team which finishes fifth in the 10-team group must play off over two legs against a team from CONCACAF. Uruguay, who have 18 points, and Venezuela, who have 17, stayed in contention after their 2-2 draw in Puerto Ordaz while Colombia, also on 17, kept their hopes alive with a 1-0 win over Peru. Argentina paid for missing several first-half chances before Ecuador's Walter Ayovi and Pablo Palacios scored in the last 20 minutes in rainy Quito at 2,800 metres above sea level. Diego Maradona's men were thumped 6-1 by Bolivia in their last away fixture at altitude in La Paz two months ago. Lionel Messi missed a glaring chance in the 10th minute before Carlos Tevez had his penalty saved by Argentine-born Ecuador goalkeeper Marcelo Elizaga. "The didn't do anything in the first half," Maradona told reporters. "In the second half, they got a couple of rebounds and they scored two goals. PHILOSOPHICAL BIELSA Chile were faced by five defenders and three defensive midfielders against Bolivia in Santiago but finally broke through with a Jean Beausejour header just before halftime. Two goals from Alexis Sanchez and one from Marco Estrada in the second half completed their third win in four qualifiers. Chile's enigmatic Argentine coach Marcelo Bielsa was philosophical about his team's chances of a first World Cup appearance since 1998. "Like the public, we have dreams and clear objectives in this sense," he said. "But football is so full of the unexpected that it's never a good idea to pre-announce something which has still not happened." Brazil coach Dunga was more direct in his assessment of the win over Paraguay in Recife. "We need three more points to be sure (of qualifying)," he said. Salvador Cabanas gave Paraguay a shock first-half lead with a deflect free kick. However, Robinho volleyed the equaliser four minutes before halftime before a fortuitous Nilmar goal in the 50th minute gave the hosts their third straight win. Paraguay, who have taken one point from their last four games, dropped to third with 24 points. Brazil have 27, one more than Chile. Uruguay appeared set for a win in Venezuela when Diego Forlan put them 2-1 ahead in the 73rd minute only for Jose Manuel Rey's free kick to earn the hosts a point two minutes later. Radamel Falcao Garcia scored the only goal in Medellin as Colombia handed Peru their eighth straight defeat
