 Dhaka, June 12 (bdnews24.com)Finance minister A M A Muhith has said the budget he proposed on Thursday set a target of 5.5 to 6.0 percent GDP growth, not 5.5 percent, for FY2009-10. He pointed out a few corrections at the start of a post-budget press briefing at National Economic Council auditorium in the capital on Friday. He laid out the Tk 114,000 crore budget in the parliament amid an opposition boycott. "In section 80 of page 24 of the budget speech I had said in the face of global recession our economic growth will be 5.5 to 6.0 percent. "But the media reported that the economic growth rate for the next fiscal year has been set at 5.5 percent. Muhith said he had said in the speech that that the growth would hover between 5.5 and 6.0 percent. The copy of the budget text made available to the media by the parliament secretariat on Thursday said the growth will be 5.5 percent in the next year and go upward in the next two years. The finance minister further said that the section 24 of page 7 should read the foreign exchange reserve stood at $ 6.88 billion, instead of $ 6.52 billion, until May 3, 2009. Section 324 of page 84 said the existing tax holiday provision, which will be in force up to the year 2012, will not be extended. It should read 2011, instead of 2012. Again, section 321 of page 82 said any mobile-phone company transforms into publicly-traded company by offloading a minimum 10 percent of its paid-up capital on the stock exchange, the budget proposes 35 percent tax on that company. Muhith said it was in fact 37.5 percent, not 35 percent. bdn
