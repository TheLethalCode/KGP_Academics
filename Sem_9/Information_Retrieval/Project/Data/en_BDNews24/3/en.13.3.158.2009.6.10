 MADRID, June 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid are in talks to buy more players after sealing the transfer of Brazil forward Kaka from AC Milan, sporting director Jorge Valdano said on Tuesday. "We have needs and we will try to satisfy them with more signings which must make us better," Valdano said in comments published on the club's website (www.realmadrid.com). "But we are beholden to the market and things are not as fluid as we would like," he added after Kaka became the Prmera Liga club's first signing under new president Florentino Perez. "We will be working on purchases and sales at the same time and see then what squad we are left with, certainly a better one than last season which is the main aim," said Valdano
