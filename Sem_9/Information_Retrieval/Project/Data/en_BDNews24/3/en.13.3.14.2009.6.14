<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 14 (bdnews24.com)The United States has urged Bangladesh "not to politicise" the issue of trial of 1971 war criminals, stressing accountability of the government. "Let me say on the question of war crimes that the United States believes strongly in the importance of accountability," the visiting US assistant secretary of state Robert O Blake told a press conference on Sunday. "But in my discussion with the friends here in the government we also urged that this not become a politicised issue," Blake, who arrived in Dhaka Saturday on a two-day visit, told reporters at the American Club. Elaborating the US position on trying the war criminals, he said, "Your country has just had freest and fairest elections in your history, democracy has been strengthened. "It is important that no actions be taken that would be considered by the people of Bangladesh as mechanisms to weaken democracy, and undermine the progress that has been made." The assistant secretary of state in charge of South and Central Asian affairs met foreign minster Dipu Moni and home minister Sahara Khatun at their offices in the morning. He will also meet Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Sunday evening. This is Blake's first visit to Bangladesh since succeeding Richard A Boucher in May. Demands from civil society for the trial of war crimes committed during Bangladesh's war of independence from Pakistan, have gathered momentum in recent years. The exact number of people killed by the then occupying Pakistan army and their collaborators in Bangladesh is not known, though most estimates put the figure at around three million. According to some reports, an estimated 200,000 women were raped during the bloody nine-month war. To date, no one has been brought to justice for these crimes. The Awami League government, coming to power in January, has finally initiated the process of trying war criminals including the top leaders of Bangladesh Jaamat-e-Islami which opposed the country's independence from Pakistan. 'Govt should probe BDR deaths' Blake also told the press conference that the government should investigate all extra judicial killings including the deaths of border guards who have died in custody since the bloody BDR mutiny in February. "There has been a serious investigation into what occurred in the Bangladeshi Rifles, but we also discussed the deaths in custody and we talked about the how it is important for the government to investigate those, to carry out a credible investigation and to bring those, who might have been responsible for the deaths in custody, to justice," said Blake. "Those kinds of actions will help provide the basis for increased cooperation with the Bangladesh Rifles as they reconstitute themselves after the incident that took place", he said. A visiting European Union delegation last week also urged the government to investigate the deaths of at least 20 BDR personnel died in the custody. Authorities have reported their deaths as 'suicides', or being caused by 'illnesses' including 'heart attacks'. On regional terrorism Blake supported Dhaka's move to form a South Asian Taskforce for combating terrorism in the region, but made it clear that the US had no role to play in the proposed taskforce. He said Bangladesh government should work in such way so that both domestic terrorist groups like JMB and transnational terrorists could not harm Bangladesh and other countries in the region. Blake said the US would assist to protect people from terrorism and safeguard Bangladesh's maritime boundary. "We are here to help you to protect your people from those who wish to destabilise your democracy through terrorism and extremism," he said. "I know that there are proposals here in Bangladesh to establish a South Asian taskforce and that might be one of the mechanisms to increase cooperation between countries not only in the SAARC region, but in the other region." "And certainly that is a good possibility, but we don't have any particular role to play in that," said Blake.
