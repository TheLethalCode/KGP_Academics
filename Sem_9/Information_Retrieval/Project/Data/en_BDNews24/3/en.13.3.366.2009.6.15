 Dhaka, June 15 (bdnews24.com)  Newly appointed army chief General Md Abdul Mubeen took up his new office on Monday, the Inter Service Public Relations said in a statement. Mubeen formally signed in the command takeover document at the Army Headquarters and took the baton from outgoing army chief General Moeen U Ahmed. On assuming office, the new army chief called on the prime minister as well as defence minister, Sheikh Hasina, the statement said. Navy chief rear admiral ZU Ahmed and air chief air marshal SM Ziaur Rahman wore Mubeen the rank badge in presence of the prime minister . Defence secretary Kamrul Hassan and other high military officers watched the ceremony. Gen Mubin, former GOC in Jessore and Chittagong, was made Principal Staff Officer to the Armed Forces Division exactly a year ago, on June 4, 2008, in a major reshuffle of top army posts. Mubin, named new chief on June 4, made a well-received televised statement on the night of Feb 27 to clarify that the 'general amnesty' the government had declared during the Feb 25-26 BDR mutiny did not mean that rebel BDR border guards involved in killings, arson and other crimes would go unpunished. Earlier, the outgoing army chief placed floral wreaths at Shikha Onirban at the Army Headquarters. He paid tribute to the martyred armed force members and signed in the visitors' book. A smart contingent of armed forces offered Moeen guard of honour at Senakunja. He was seen off in an armoured vehicle, according to the army tradition. bdne
