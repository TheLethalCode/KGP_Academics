 MELBOURNE, June 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's soccer players arrived in Australia on Saturday wearing face masks as a precaution against 'swine flu' before their final World Cup qualifier. Australian officials said Wednesday's Asian World Cup qualifying Group One match in Melbourne would go ahead as scheduled despite the sharp rise of H1N1 flu cases in the country. The flu has already caused disruptions to Australia's sporting calendar with a swimming meet in Melbourne cancelled last week. A handful of top-flight rugby and Australian Rules players were also quarantined after testing positive for the virus. Wednesday's match has effectively become a dead rubber after both teams safely booked their places in next year's World Cup in South Africa last weekend. Japan arrived in Australia without several key players, including Celtic midfielder Shunsuke Nakamura, but were taking no chances with the health of those who did make the trip. Passengers arriving at Australian airports have been subjected to thermal scanning and issued with hygiene warnings. All of the Japan players and coaching staff were wearing face masks upon arrival but removed them after leaving the airport. The Japan players shook off the cobwebs from their overnight flight with a light training session at a suburban park later on Saturday. "We have 15 points (from seven games) which was our objective," Japan coach Takeshi Okada told Japanese media before leaving Tokyo on Friday. "It hurts that Australia have 17 points. They'll be at full strength and we expect a tough game but we plan to return home having finished top of the group." Australian media reported more than 130 new cases of the virus last weekend. The H1N1 flu has infected almost 30,000 people in over 70 countries with 145 deaths reported, according to the World Health Organisation
