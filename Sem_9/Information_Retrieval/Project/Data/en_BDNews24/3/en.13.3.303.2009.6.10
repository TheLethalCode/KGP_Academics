<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 10(bdnews24.com)  Legal steps are being taken by the government to get back 28 houses allotted in the past to influential political leaders under real and fake names, state minister for housing and works Abdul Mannan Khan said on Wednesday. "The ministry will take back the houses as quickly as possible," Khan told reporters after meeting German ambassador Frank Mayke. He said the ambassador requested him to hand over house NW(I)-6 at Gulshan for the German Embassy, as has been long-allotted. The house could not be handed over to the embassy because of legal tangles, the minister said. Haris Chowdhury, political secretary to former prime minister Khaleda Zia, at one point took possession of the residence from one Fakir Mahbub Anam, though the house now lies vacant. "The embassy will be allotted another property if this one cannot be given," the minister said. In return, the German Embassy will make similar arrangement in Berlin for the Bangladesh High Commission, he said. On the allotments of plots at Purbachal, the minister said 65,000 applications were filed for 6,000 plots. "It is very difficult to select 6,000 eligible applicants. But the government will complete the allocation in a transparent manner," he said. "The prime minister has given a special directive in this matter," he added. bdne
