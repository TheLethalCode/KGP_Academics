 Abdur Rahim Harmachi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Jun 14 (bdnews24.com)Debate has been raging among the country's trade bodies since the finance minister, laying out the government's maiden budget last week, extended the facility to 'whiten black money', imposing a 10 percent tax and with the proviso that it was invested in certain sectors. The country's apex trade body FBCCI has welcomed the move, a number of other business bodies including the MCCI, BGMEA, BKMEA and the FICCI have slammed it. In an unprecedented measure, the government has proposed a lengthy three-year amnesty to draw 'black money' into the capital market, start-up industries and physical infrastructure. The Federation of Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FBCCI) president Annisul Huq thanked the government for the move on Saturday. "Investment will get a boost. More jobs will be generated." On the other hand, the Foreign Investment Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) president Waliur Rahman said it was a shame that the FBCCI had appreciated the proposal. "Those who regularly pay tax will be frustrated with the move of three years' scope for legalising undisclosed money. It will erode the culture of paying taxes built over the years," Waliur told bdnews24.com on Sunday. "This will cause reduction in revenue collection and no business body can support such a proposal." Abdus Salam Murshedi, president of Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), said the culture of allowing 'black money to be whitened' should end. "Undisclosed money is being encouraged as repeated scopes are being given to legalise it. How long will it continue?" said Murshedi. The Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI) has long been protesting any scope for whitening black money. The finance minister proposed "acceptance of undisclosed money without any question during the period from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2012 provided that a payment of 10% tax is made and it is invested in certain new industries  physical infrastructure facilities and shares of listed companies of stock exchange."

The infrastructure facilities include ports and container facilities, fly-overs and elevated roads, mono and underground railways, telecoms sector except mobile phone, water and waste treatment plants and solar energy plant. Homeowners too will have the chance to buy with no questions asked. "To address the housing problem, I propose to accept the investment incurred for the purchase of flat or construction of houses without any question by paying a tax at a specific rate according to the measurement of the flat/house," said Muhith in his budget speech. 'Money whitening' facilities have only ever been offered for months at a time by previous governments. In the lead-up to the budget, analysts on the wholeas opposed to the business communityhad been critical of such amnesties for tax dodgers, on both ethical and practical grounds. Muhith, the day after presenting his budget in parliament, said reality forced him to extend the provision to boost flagging investment. "Ethics lost out to expediency on the question of giving the scope to whiten black money," he told reporters at a post-budget press briefing on Friday, as economists and analysts came down hard against the provision. Muhith too has been consistently opposed to 'money whitening' schemes in the past, even speaking out against them in the lead up to the budget. "I personally believe the provision for whitening black money is unethical," he said again on Friday. "The prime minister is also against it, but politics is the highest art of compromise," he said, explaining the rationale for the move. The finance minister in his budget speech last Thursday said the facility was being given to boost investment, employment and to create more homeowners. "We would like to open up opportunities for employment for the common man and attain economic prosperity. There are many potential sectors of our economy where investments could carry forward our efforts for change," he said in his preamble to the proposed three-year amnesty. He also said housing was "a fundamental right of the people". "People invest their long saved money for buying flats or construction of own house, which they subsequently find difficult to explain to the income tax department," said Muhith. bdn
