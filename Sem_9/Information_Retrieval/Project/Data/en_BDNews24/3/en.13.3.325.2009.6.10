<TITLE> Beijing ambitious for Asia Trophy despite top four snub </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIJING, June 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Beijing hopes that hosting the Asia Trophy will help it become the continent's soccer centre despite the absence of a top four finisher from the English Premier League for the first time in the tournament's history. Tottenham Hotspur, West Ham United and Hull City will contest the tournament with Beijing Guoan on July 29 and 31 as part of the Beijing International Football Festival, which also includes the Italian Super Cup between Inter Milan and Lazio on Aug. 8. "The 2009 Asia Trophy will bring splendour to the festival," Beijing Football Association (BFA) director Hu Zhaoguan told a news conference on Wednesday. "It will help us improve the status of Beijing in world sport and make Beijing the capital of Asian football." It will also, however, be the first time that the biennial tournament will not feature one of the top four clubs from the preceding season after Chelsea (2003), Everton (2005) and Liverpool (2007) played in the previous three versions. The Premier League's Richard Masters said Chelsea, who finished third last season, had expressed an interest in taking part but subsequently decided not to, adding that the league were "very happy" with the trio of clubs involved. "It's not really a commercial enterprise in the sense that it doesn't make finance for the Premier League," Masters, director of sales and marketing, explained. "What it does is provide something back. What we export at the moment is a television signal. I think it's very important for us to be visible here. "We don't always have the big clubs coming so it provides an opportunity for the smaller clubs to experience Asia and build their fan bases here." PACKED STADIUMS Perhaps mindful that even the pull of clubs like Manchester United and Real Madrid has failed to fill stadiums in China in recent years, organisers said tickets would be priced with the aim of getting as many fans into the stadium as possible. "We want to be playing to packed stadiums," said Dan Johnson, the league's head of press. "We want not only to market the English Premier League but also help improve the status of professional football in China." While the Italian Super Cup will take place at the Bird's Nest on the first anniversary of the opening of the Beijing Olympics, the Asia Trophy will be at Guoan's home Worker's Stadium with a capacity of 49,000 for the event. The Premier League will also run raft of coaching initiatives, refereeing schemes and community programmes around the tournament, providing what they hope will be a lasting legacy. "This is the start of the process, not the end," Johnson added
