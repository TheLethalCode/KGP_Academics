 Dhaka, June 13 (bdnews24.com)  Speaker Abdul Hamid has again asked the opposition to return to parliament to discuss issues of national importance. "After everything, I request all opposition members to join parliament immediately and discuss, before the nation, serious issues like budget," the speaker said Saturday at a workshop of the public accounts committee. The opposition has refused to join the parliament since the start of the budget session, as it refused for most of the maiden session, over an ongoing seating dispute. Hamid reiterated that it was not possible to provide the opposition more seats in the front row. "Five seats have been provided after much consideration," he said. Both the ruling and opposition chief whips were consulted over the issue, he said. Parliament Secretariat and World Bank jointly organised the workshop at the Dhaka Sheraton. BNP MPs MK Anwar, public accounts committee chairman KH Rahiduzzaman, acting World Bank country representative Tahseen Sayeed and parliament secretary Ashfaq Hamid were at the workshop. MK Anwar said if the public accounts committee worked actively it would help increase accountability of the government. bdne
