<TITLE> Vettori matures into considerable cricketer </TITLE>

 LONDON, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Daniel Vettori is a master of self-deprecation, a handy attribute for a captain of the New Zealand cricket team. Asked earlier this year why he had not welcomed new team manager Dave Currie with a haka, the Maori war dance preceding All Blacks' rugby matches, Vettori replied: "Skinny white men with glasses shouldn't do hakas." Leading a team who habitually struggle on the world stage encourages both stoicism and wry humour. As a spin-bowling all-rounder Vettori also carries an unusually heavy burden. It helps that he is an unusual man. For a start there is the name. Daniel Luca Vettori, son of an Italian father and New Zealand mother, stands out in a team and country where, unlike Australia, the settlers have been predominantly English and Scots-Irish. Then there is the precocious start, 10 days after his 18th birthday, when he was selected for the New Zealand side and put a planned university career on hold. He is still the youngest player to represent his country. Finally there was the image. Long-haired, slender and bespectacled, Vettori looked every inch the student cricketer. Twelve years on Vettori has filled out, the hair is shorter and he has grown a beard. He is now not only the captain in the current Twenty20 World Cup in England but also his team's key player, who has been sorely missed in the opening matches while recovering from an injured shoulder. HARD WORK Vettori has plied his trade as an orthodox left-arm spinner at a time when batsmen have started using bats with surfaces like trampolines and pitches that have offered little to finger spinners. He has responded by evolving into a modern master of flight, who is regularly rated as the best bowler in 50-overs cricket and who was the most economical at the inaugural 2007 Twenty20 World Cup. A genuine tailender in his early days, he has by hard work and intelligent application made himself into the best number eight in test history. In a test against Bangladesh in Chittagong last October, Vettori became the first man to score more than 50 runs in each of his team's innings and capture at least four wickets in each of the opposition's innings. The shorter format of the game suits New Zealand, who lack the playing resources of their rivals -- something that is exposed in a five-day test. Talking to reporters before the Twenty20 tournament opened, Vettori said New Zealand were striving for consistency in a game which can turn on one over. HIGH EXPECTATIONS "This is the chance in this tournament to put some of this consistency together. We have high expectations of ourselves and I know the New Zealand public has high expectations of us. "We feel that and, although we fly under the radar in terms of world cricket, the people who care about New Zealand cricket had high expectations," he said. "I think you can handle when an individual takes the game away from you, it's when your team doesn't put a performance together. It is difficult because guys play so aggressively your risk of failure is higher than any other format of the game." Vettori said he and his team, who came into the tournament equal with Australia as the two most experienced Twenty20 nations, had learned to make the adjustment from 50-overs cricket. "You just take parts of the one-day game out of it. It's the first 10 overs and the last 10 overs of a one-day international so a lot of our guys have played so much international cricket now they understand the quick switch and I think they have a good feel for it," he said. Spinners play a substantial role in Twenty20 cricket. Again, Vettori keeps it simple. "I think the thing with spin bowling is you know batsmen are going to be aggressive to you so you don't have to second-guess yourself," he said. "I've found throughout my career that guys are going to come down and try and put you out of the park. If you can nullify that then you become a good spin bowler in this format of the game." Vettori, who modified his action after back problems, is still only 30. He is eight tests away from reaching the hundred landmark and seven wickets short of becoming the eighth man to score 3,000 test runs and take 300 test wickets. The others are his compatriot Richard Hadlee, New Zealand's finest cricketer, Ian Botham, Imran Khan, Kapil Dev, Shaun Pollock, Chaminda Vaas and Shane Warne. Vettori belongs in their company
