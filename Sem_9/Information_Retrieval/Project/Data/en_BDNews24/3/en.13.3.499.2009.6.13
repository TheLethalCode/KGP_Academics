 CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Jun 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - NASA filled space shuttle Endeavour's fuel tank on Friday for an early-morning liftoff on a mission to deliver the last part of Japan's laboratory to the International Space Station. Endeavour and its seven-member crew are scheduled to blast off at 7:17 a.m. EDT (1117 GMT) on Saturday from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. With good weather expected for launch, technicians began pumping a half-million gallons (1.9 million litres) of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen into the shuttle's fuel tanks around 10 p.m. EDT on Friday (0200 GMT on Saturday). Endeavour is carrying a Japanese-built porch that will be installed on the space station's $2.4 billion Kibo complex, Japan's primary contribution to the $100 billion orbiting research outpost. The lab includes a robot arm and a small airlock so science experiments can be installed outside the station and retrieved without the need for spacewalks by station or shuttle crew members. Endeavour also is carrying laboratory racks, experiments, supplies and dozens of spare parts, which will be stored aboard the outpost in preparation for when the shuttle is no longer flying. NASA has eight shuttle missions remaining to complete construction of the space station. It plans to retire the three-ship fleet at the end of 2010. The Endeavour crew plans to spend 12 days at the station and conduct five spacewalks to install the porch, replace batteries and tackle a long list of maintenance tasks. The mission is NASA's first since the station's live-aboard crew was expanded from three to six members last month. When the shuttle crew arrives, it will bring the total number of people aboard the space station to a record 13. The combined crew includes two Canadian astronauts -- station flight engineer Robert Thirsk and Endeavour astronaut Julie Payette -- Japan's Koichi Wakata, Europe's Frank De Winne, Russian cosmonauts Gennady Padalka and Roman Romanenko and seven US astronauts. Wakata will be returning home with the shuttle crew after a three-month stay on the station. His replacement is NASA astronaut Timothy Kopra, one of Endeavour's four rookie fliers
