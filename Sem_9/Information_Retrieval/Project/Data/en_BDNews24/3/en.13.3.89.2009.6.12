 SARAJEVO, Fri Jun 12, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Bosnian war crimes court jailed a Bosnian Serb wartime commander for 25 years Friday for ordering a mortar attack in 1995on a northern town that killed 71 people and wounded more than 150. Novak Djukic was found guilty of war crimes against civilians and violations of international law and the Geneva conventions on the protection of civilians during warfare, the court council said. "Novak Djukic is guilty ... because he ordered on May 25, 1995 his artillery unit on the Mountain Ozren to shell Tuzla, which had been declared a United Nations safe zone," said Darko Samardzic, the court council president.

He added the court was aware the sentence would be regarded as mild by families of the victims, and harsh by Djukic's brothers-in-arms. Hilmo Bucuk, who led a group of parents of child victims to the Sarajevo court, said the prevailing mood was one of satisfaction that Djukic was punished, but that they had hoped for a life sentence.
