<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com)A comment by a Pakistan foreign officer that war crimes trials in Bangladesh may lead to a straining of relations between the countries was "misconstrued", the high commission in Dhaka said in a statement on Wednesday. An additional secretary to Pakistan's foreign ministry, Masood Khalil, told visiting Bangladeshi media in Islamabad on June 6 that Pakistan's relations with Bangladesh might "cast a shadow" if Dhaka went ahead with the trials. "We hope nothing will be done to create a slow down in our relations," Masood had said, when asked to comment on Dhaka's latest move to try the crimes against humanity during the 1971 war of independence from Pakistan. The comment caused concern in Bangladesh. Law minister Shafiq Ahmed has said it violated norms of international relations. The Pakistani high commission in its statement Wednesday said: "Remarks attributed to an official of the Pakistan foreign ministry have evidently been misconstrued and quoted out of context." It also said: "Pakistan enjoys good, friendly and brotherly relations with Bangladesh. "It is determined to further strengthen these relations on the basis of equality, mutual respect, mutual benefit and non-interference in each other's internal affairs." Foreign minister Dipu Moni had told parliament just the previous day that the government would not tolerate any country's "interference" in the trial of war criminals. She also said Bangladesh's relations with any country would "not influence" the trials.
