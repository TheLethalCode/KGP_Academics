<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com)  Twelve cases against prime minister Sheikh Hasina will be revoked on the grounds of 'political harassment', the state minister for law said on Wednesday. The Anticorruption Commission filed ten of the cases against Hasina during the immediate past caretaker government on various charges. The decision came from the first meeting of the scrutiny committee on petitions for cancelling 'political harassment' cases, Kamrul Islam told reporters after attending the meeting at the home ministry. The committee also decided to repeal another 50 cases against leaders of the ruling Awami League that include nine against Tofael Ahmed, 13 against Kamal Ahmed Majumdar, six against Abul Hasnat Abdullah, four against Bahauddin Nasim and two against Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir, said Islam. They also include one each against Mosharraf Hossain, Hazi Moqbul Hossain and state minister for public works Abdul Mannan Khan. The committee reviewed 113 cases in total in the meeting, the minister said. No petitions of the opposition BNP leaders have yet been sent to the home ministry, he added. 'Directions' The relevant deputy commissioners will be given directions and the Anticorruption Commission will be requested to take steps to withdraw the cases, said Islam. "The home ministry will write to the deputy commissioners and government lawyers to directly revoke those cases, filed under CrPC. And the cases filed by AAC will be forwarded for legal actions attaching comments." Asked whether the comments attached could be interpreted as 'interference from government', Kamrul replied, "We are speaking of those cases filed with political motivation, where the ACC did not work independently." "Of course the government would not as a rule interfere in the ACC's activities. The ACC will work according to its rule." All AL to date A total of 824 petitions were submitted to the home ministry up to Wednesday after filtering through different phases, said Kamrul Islam. All of them were from ruling party Awami League members. He said his committee found 62 cases revocable among 113 filed petitions in the first meeting. Of these, 36 were filed under the Criminal Procedure Code and the rest filed by the Anticorruption Commission. The state minister speculating that the number of petitions received after filtering through the district level committees may be around 5,000 out of the tens of thousands of applications submitted countrywide. Kamrul said the committee's final decisions will be executed quickly. However, the scrutiny committee has requested the home ministry to extend its deadline up to June 30, he said. Its second meeting will be on June 21. Vetting for 'real criminals' The committee was formed on Feb 22, after the law ministry said it would look into "cases of political harassment under the past BNP and caretaker governments". The law minister later said that "politically motivated" cases filed during any previous government could be appealed. "We are being very careful to ensure that any real criminal can not abuse this offer to revoke only political harassment cases," said Islam. "The recommendations would only be made for fully politically motivated ones." bdnews
