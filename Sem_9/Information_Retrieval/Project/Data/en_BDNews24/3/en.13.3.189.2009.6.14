 JOHANNESBURG, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hosts South Africa or Asian champions Iraq could well be on course for a semi-final place if they can win their opening match in the Confederations Cup which kicks off on Sunday (1400 GMT). With European champions Spain expected to win the group and Oceania champions New Zealand widely predicted to finish bottom of the Group A quartet, the runners-up spot is up for grabs with the prize a place in the last four. South Africa's Brazilian coach Joel Santana said on Saturday that his team were all ready and that playmaker Teko Modise would start the game against Iraq despite being clattered in training on Saturday morning. Bora Milutinovic, Iraq's widely-travelled coach who has only been in charge of the squad for a few weeks, said he was relishing the biggest challenge of his life and was optimistic his team would do well against the hosts, despite the vociferous home support they will receive at Ellis Park. The second match of the day is at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenburg (1830 GMT) where Spain look to extend their 32-match unbeaten run against a New Zealand team that led world champions Italy three times in a friendly in Pretoria on Wednesday before going down to a 4-3 defeat. Spain, top of FIFA's world rankings for a year and among the favourites to win the World Cup in South Africa in 2010, have won their last 12 matches and have brought a strong squad to South Africa, including Fernando Torres who scored in their 1-0 win over Germany in the Euro 2008 final. Spain have never met New Zealand in a full international and their only previous meeting dates back to the 1997 World Under-17 Cup when Spain beat the "All Whites" 13-0. Spain are unlikely to enjoy such mastery again on Sunday but it will be a major upset if they do not chalk up their 13th successive victory and take their own first step towards the last four
