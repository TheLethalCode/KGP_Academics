 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnedws24.com)Finance minister A M A Muhith on Thursday rolled out an extensive Tk 1,13,819 crore budget aiming to boost domestic spending and rev up recession-hit growth, forecast to be sliding toward a seven-year low of 5.5 percent. The annual outlay for 2009-10 fiscal year starting on July 1 saw a 15 percent rise on the previous year to turn the wheel on an economy in virtual recession. Accent was put on raising investment, boosting agriculture, enhancing rural and industrial development, and widening the social safety net for the poor. The annual development programme is ambitious, at Tk 30,500 crore, up by 32.6 percent from the outgoing one, which was revised to Tk 23,000 crore. Muhith proposed an unprecedented three-year amnesty to draw black money into the mainstream economy. "No questions will be asked" on source of funds provided a flat-rate 10 percent tax is paid and the money is invested in one of 42 sectors from July 1, 2009 to June 30 2012, the minister said. It also focused on much-needed improvement of collapsing infrastructure and transport links and scaling up power generation. To ride out the global recession impacts, the minister unveiled a new stimulus package worth Tk 4993 crore for the last quarter of current fiscal to help deal with the impact of global financial meltdown on the readymade garment and other export-focused sectors. But the apparel exporters who cried for government support to face "unprecedented" challenges got no allocation of any additional incentives under the package. "The global recession impacted our economy on three fronts: exports, imports and remittances," Muhith said. "Except for ready-made garments and the domestic textile sector, exports of all other commodities have declined compared to the previous year," he said. "We will not let the export industry, which is currently undergoing a setback, get sick," he said. The first budget of the Awami League-led government, presented in absence of opposition parties in parliament over an ongoing seating dispute, will carry an overall deficit of Tk 34,358 crore, assuming revenues of Tk 79,461crore taka. Muhith proposed to meet the deficit with loans of Tk 20,555 crore from internal sources and another Tk 13,803 crore from foreign aid. Growth is targeted at just 5.5 percent. And with falling commodity and fuel prices, along with favourable production conditions, annual average inflation would come down to 6.5 percent from 7 percent, he predicted. It allocates Tk 2100 crore to finance public-private partnership (PPP)projects tied up with private equities to invest in disintegrating roads and power networksand Tk 3,600 crore in subsidies to agriculture, which contributes 21 percent of GDP. Muhith sought to help senior citizens and pensioners with a reduced direct tax burden but said the much-abused tax holidays will be replaced with low rates. Muhith proposed to set up a new court styled National Tax Tribunal and listed plans to make more people pay. He also proposed acceptance of undisclosed money "without any question" for an unprecedented term of three years, from July 1 to June 30, 2012, provided that a payment of 10 percent tax is made for stocks, start-ups in textiles, garments, leather, drugs, BMRE and physical infrastructure. Public employees will get enhanced pay and perks from next month in line with the Pay Commission recommendations. The finance minister has sought to make basic industrial raw materials cheaper, with proposals to reduce duty rate from seven percent to five percent. Tk. 4,285 crore had been allocated in the budget of 2008-09 fiscal year for subsidy for fertiliser and other agricultural inputs to help the farmers. Tk 21,367 crore has been allocated for education and technology and health sectors together, which is 19 percent of the total budget. Mobile-phone sets, airconditioners and personal cars, among others, will get pricier as the budget has proposed revising the tariff structure. bd
