<TITLE> No systematic violence in Zimbabwe: Tsvangirai </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 HARARE, Jun 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai said there was no signs of systematic intimidation and violence in Zimbabwe, remarks that may reassure Western donors who have called for improved human rights in the country. "There is no evidence that there is a general campaign of intimidation and violence in the country," he told Al Jazeera television in an interview which will be broadcast Friday. A new unity government was formed by President Robert Mugabe and Tsvangirai in February but their power-sharing deal has not been fully implemented. Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) has long accused Mugabe's ZANU-PF of carrying out violence to further its political aims, charges it denies. Arrests of MDC activists have strained the new government. Western donors have said aid will only flow when a democracy is created and economic reforms are implemented. Tsvangirai's comments may point to an easing of political tensions in the new administration
