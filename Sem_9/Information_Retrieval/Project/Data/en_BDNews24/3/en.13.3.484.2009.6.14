 DERA ISMAIL KHAN, Pakistan, Sun Jun 14, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suspected US drone aircraft fired a missile on Sunday killing three militants in northwest Pakistan, while elsewhere in the region, a bomb blast in a market killed seven people, officials said. Nuclear-armed Pakistani is struggling to push back a growing Taliban insurgency and security forces have made progress in more than a month of fighting against Taliban militants in the Swat valley, northwest of Islamabad.

Pakistani warplanes struck another Mehsud stronghold on Saturday in retaliation for the killing of an anti-Taliban cleric in a suicide bomb attack in the city of Lahore the previous day, the military said. The Sunday bomb attack was in a market in the northwestern town of Dera Ismail Khan. "It seems the bomb was planted. At the moment, we have at least seven dead and 50 wounded," Syed Mohsin Shah, the top government official in the city, told Reuters. Rising violence has raised fears for Pakistan's stability and for the safety of its nuclear arsenal but the offensive in Swat has reassured the United States, which needs its Muslim ally's help to defeat al Qaeda and stabilize neighboring Afghanistan. On Thursday, the US House of Representatives approved tripling aid to Pakistan to about $1.5 billion a year for five years to help combat extremism through development.
