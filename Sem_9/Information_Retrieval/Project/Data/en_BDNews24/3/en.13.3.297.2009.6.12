 Dhaka, June 12 (bdnews24.com)  The target GDP growth 5.5 percent, in the proposed budget of 2009-10 is 'surprising', said economic think tank Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD). The growth target was not clear and it could have been set higher in the changed situation under an elected government. "In spite of many setbacks 5.9 percent GDP was achieved last year," CPD's honourable fellow and former executive director Debopriya Bhattacharya said in a post-budget discussion, pointing out the weaknesses. "It indicates that we are moving backward," he added. "From that perspective the budget is not ambitious, rather it is far from reality," said Bhattacharya. Finance minister AMA Muhith proposed Tk 1,14000 crore budget on Thursday. The annual outlay for 2009-10 fiscal year starting on July 1 saw a 15 percent rise on the previous year to turn the wheel on the economy. CPD put emphasis on five sectors to implement budget in the next fiscal year. These are keeping up agricultural development, export earning and remittance in the midst of global recession; increasing revenue earning; reviving developmental efforts and keeping administration running. However, CPD has found some innovativeness in the budget, including infrastructural renovation in case of financial planning, reviving midterm planning, district-wise budget. But it thinks there is a lack of transparency in some sectors in case of allocation. CPD executive director Mustafizur Rahman was also present at the discussion at BRAC centre at Mohakhali. b
