<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com)The main opposition BNP, who remained absent from parliament during the finance minister's speech Thursday, has called the Awami League government's maiden budget "a web of dreams". BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar made the comment to reporters in an instant reaction on the budget soon after watching the speech live on TV. "The budget is full of empty rhetoric. The finance minister is weaving a web of dreams," he said. He said it was "highly ambitious" and "unachievable." "The budget will fail to play any role in public welfare. The people of the country will cast it aside." Delwar was flanked by a panel, called together for an instant analysis, that included former ministers Osman Faruq, Abdul Moin Khan, former FBCCI president Abdul Awal Mintoo, former vice chancellor of Jahangirnagar University Mostahidur Rahman and Dhaka University professor Mahbub Ullah among others. Delwar said, "No budget can be implemented unless rule of law is established but the finance minister said nothing on the establishment of good governance." He also blasted the government for leaking data about raised duty on certain products. Former minister Osman Faruq said, "It seems to me that the finance minister is dreaming." "The sectors which have received allocation have no consistency with the projected growth," he said. Muhith's budget targets 5.5 percent GDP growth for the coming year, down from 5.88 percent growth in the outgoing fiscal. "The government will have to depend on bank borrowing to implement the budget,"he added. "The optimism of the finance minister will remain a mere dream as spending will exceed earnings." Moin Khan said, "The budget has disappointed us as it seems to me that it is a cut and paste version of the old budget." BNP has been boycotting the House over a seating dispute with the ruling partysince the new parliement convened in January. bdnews2
