<TEXT>
 NOTTINGHAM, England, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Aaron Redmond crashed 63 from 30 deliveries to help New Zealand crush Ireland by 83 runs in the opening World Cup second-round match on Thursday. Ireland, replying to New Zealand's 198 for five, never threatened to upset the Kiwis and were bowled out for just 115 in 16.4 overs. Redmond, officially cleared to replace the ailing Jesse Ryder in New Zealand's squad, upstaged opening partner Brendon McCullum with an innings which belied his reputation as a dogged batsman. Redmond's dominance was shown when New Zealand's fifty was registered by a McCullum six that sailed over the square leg boundary, the hundredth maximum of the tournament. Redmond was then on 40 and proving a worthy replacement for Ryder, who was undergoing tests in hospital for an infection. He was eventually lbw to medium-pacer Alex Cusack but his departure was followed by a solid partnership of 61 between Scott Styris (42) and Martin Guptill (45 not out). Ireland's batsmen struggled against the off-spin of Nathan McCullum, brother of Brendon, who completed figures of three for 15. Brendon McCullum was leading the side in place of the injured Daniel Vettori. Ireland next play on Sunday against Sri Lanka at Lord's and New Zealand meet Pakistan at The Oval on Saturday
