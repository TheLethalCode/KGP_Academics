<TEXT>
 RECIFE, Brazil, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Striker Nilmar capitalised on a piece of good fortune to earn Brazil a 2-1 home win over Paraguay on Wednesday that keeps them top of the South American World Cup qualifying table. Nilmar, who had a quiet first half, chested a Felipe Melo pass towards Kaka, only for the ball to come back to him off the unfortunate Julio Cesar Caceres and the striker managed to scramble it home in the 50th minute. Paraguay went ahead midway through the first half when Salvador Cabanas's free kick from outside the box took a deflection off Elano and looped over Brazil goalkeeper Julio Cesar. Robinho then volleyed an exquisite equaliser four minutes before halftime from Daniel Alves's cross from the right. Brazil have 27 points with four matches to go in the 10-team South American group. Paraguay are third with 24 points, two behind second placed Chile, with Argentina fourth (22). The top four qualify automatically for next year's finals in South Africa. "It was a match in which we had to be patient and persistent," Brazil coach Dunga told reporters. "We had to try playing on the wings, at speed, changing sides. Everyone plays tight away from home and that makes it difficult to win. "We need three more points to be sure (of qualifying)," he added. END-TO-END ACTION Brazil squandered several chances towards the end of an exciting second half, played in a torrential downpour in front of a crowd of 66,000 in the tropical city of Recife. Paraguay had less possession but posed more threat with their counter-attacks in the first half, midfielder Carlos Bonet shooting just over the bar and busy striker Osvaldo Martinez going close from a tight angle before Cabanas opened the scoring. His goal was only the second conceded by Brazil at home in the qualifiers and Julio Cesar had to be alert to prevent Cabanas from scoring again in the 70th minute. Paraguay keeper Justo Villar made a diving save from Robinho close to the hour and the striker also went close with a free kick and shot over near the end after a good cross from Kaka. Kaka, who signed for Real Madrid earlier this week, was guilty of a miss himself when he put the ball wide from a metre out following a low cross by marauding central defender Lucio. Brazil visit arch-rivals Argentina in their next match, with the home side clinging desperately to an automatic qualifying berth after a 2-0 loss away to Ecuador
