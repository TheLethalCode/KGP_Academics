<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com)In an unprecedented measure, the government has proposed an extended three-year amnesty to draw 'black money' into the capital market, start-up industries and physical infrastructure. A "no questions asked" policy is also offered to home buyers in the new budget. Finance minister AMA Muhith proposed "acceptance of undisclosed money without any question during the period from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2012 provided that a payment of 10% tax is made and it is invested in certain new industries  physical infrastructure facilities and shares of listed companies of stock exchange."

The infrastructure facilities include ports and container facilities, fly-overs and elevated roads, mono and underground railways, telecom sector except mobile phone, water and waste treatment plants and solar energy plant. 'Money whitening' facilities have only ever been offered for months at a time by previous governments. In the lead up to the budget, analysts on the whole - as opposed to the business community - had been critical of such amnesties for tax dodgers, on both ethical and practical grounds. The finance minister in his budget speech said the facility was being given to boost investment, employment and to create more homeowners. "We would like to open up opportunities for employment for the common man and attain economic prosperity. There are many potential sectors of our economy where investments could carry forward our efforts for change," he said in his preamble to the proposed three-year amnesty. He also said housing was "a fundamental right of the people". "People invest their long saved money for buying flats or construction of own house, which they subsequently find difficult to explain to the income tax department," said Muhith, in a somewhat finessed statement. "To address this housing problem without much pain I propose to accept the investment incurred for the purchase of flat or construction of houses without any question by paying a tax at a specific rate according to the measurement of the flat/house."
