<TEXT>
 ROME, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazil forward Alexandre Pato and Italy midfielder Andrea Pirlo will not leave AC Milan to join their former boss Carlo Ancelotti at Chelsea, the Serie A club's new coach Leonardo said on Thursday. "They are not moving from Milan," Leonardo was quoted as saying by La Gazzetta dello Sport's website (www.gazzetta.it). "They are both very important for the team. They are fundamental parts of a recent victorious past, Pirlo especially." Both players raised doubts about their futures this week after being linked to Chelsea, sparking fears among Milan fans that Brazil playmaker Kaka's move to Real Madrid could start an exodus from the San Siro. Pato even said he planned to hold talks with Ancelotti before deciding on his future. Chief executive Adriano Galliani also sought to reassure Milan fans that the 19-year-old Brazilian, who has been a constant goal threat since joining from Internacional in 2007, is going nowhere. "All the big names will 99.9 percent (certainly) stay," Galliani told reporters. "Pato, the best 19-year-old striker in the world, (will stay) 100 percent." Galliani reiterated that Milan want to buy VfL Wolfsburg striker Edin Dzeko even though the German club have said the Bosnian is not for sale. He also confirmed Andriy Shevchenko and Philippe Senderos will not be staying after their loans from Chelsea and Arsenal elapsed
