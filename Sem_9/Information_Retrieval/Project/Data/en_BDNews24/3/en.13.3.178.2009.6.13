<TEXT>
 PRETORIA, June 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro will miss his country's opening match at the Confederations Cup on Monday because of injury and could be out for their next game too, according to Italian officials. Cannavaro, 35, has a calf strain that stopped him from training with the rest of squad this week or playing in the warm up matches ahead of the start of the eight-team tournament, team doctor Enrico Castellacci told reporters on Friday. Italy meet the United States in their opening Group B match in Pretoria and play Egypt next on Thursday. The World Cup winning captain, who is returning to Juventus after a spell at Real Madrid, missed the 4-3 win over New Zealand in midweek and a training match against a local team on Friday. Cannavaro is two matches away from matching Paolo Maldini's record of 126 caps for Italy
