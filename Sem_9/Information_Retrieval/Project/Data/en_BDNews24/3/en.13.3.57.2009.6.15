 Sunamganj, June 15 (bdnews24.com)A polls official was relieved of his duty on charges of irregularities as voters were casting their votes on Monday to elect their MP in the Sunamganj-4 by-election. Abul Khair, an assistant presiding officer on polling duty at PTI Government Primary School in Sunamganj town, was relieved of his responsibilities as there were allegations of irregularities in conducting his duties. Mizanur Rahman, the returning officer for the by-election there, said as a voter had complained against Abul Khair practising unfair means, he checked and found Khair guilty and relieved him immediately. Khair was being quizzed at the election office subsequently, Rahman said. The seat became vacant on the death of Jatiya Party MP Momotaj Iqbal in April. Polling which started at 8am is due to continue through to 4pm. "Voter presence looks rather poor, but the polling is being conducted properly," Sirajul Islam, presiding officer, Shologhar Primary School, Sunamganj, told bdnews24.com in the morning. Candidates contending for the seat include the ruling Awami League-led Grand Alliance's Matiur Rahman, BNP-led four-party alliance's Fazlul Haque Aspia and the National People's Party's Krishak Mohammad Sadek. A total 230,835 voters are registered to cast their ballots at 105 polling stations throughout the constituency. bdnews
