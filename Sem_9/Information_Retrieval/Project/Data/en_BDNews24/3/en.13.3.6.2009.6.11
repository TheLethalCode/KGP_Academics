 NOTTINGHAM, England, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India seamer Zaheer Khan took four for 19 to set up a comfortable eight-wicket victory over Ireland in the final group match of the Twenty20 World Cup on Wednesday. Both teams had already qualified for the second round of the tournament. Left-arm swing bowler Zaheer, continuing his recovery from a shoulder injury, helped restrict Ireland to just 112 for eight after the match was was reduced to 18-overs a side following a rain delay. "It feels great playing after a long time, this is the second game for me, and to take a few wickets at any level is definitely boost to the confidence," Zaheer told reporters. Man-of-the-match Zaheer was well supported by spinner Pragyan Ojha, who completed figures of two for 18 from four overs. Irish all-rounder Andrew White top-scored with 29 but most of his team-mates struggled against an attack spearheaded by Zaheer. He bowled Jeremy Bray, knocking two stumps out of the ground, had Ireland captain William Porterfield and Andre Botha caught at slip in the same over and dismissed White caught behind. Rohit Sharma (52 not out) and Gautam Gambhir (37) put on 77 for the first wicket for defending champions India who reached 113 for two with 15 deliveries remaining under the Trent Bridge floodlights. India play West Indies in their first Super Eights match on Friday and Ireland face New Zealand on Thursday
