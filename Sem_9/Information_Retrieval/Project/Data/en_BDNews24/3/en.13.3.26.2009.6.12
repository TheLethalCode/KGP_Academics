 BEIRUT, Fri Jun 12, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US envoy George Mitchell said on Friday a Middle East peace agreement would not come at Lebanon's expense and praised this week's election as an "important milestone" for the country. Mitchell, who has Lebanese roots, is on a tour that has taken him to Israel, the West Bank, Egypt and Jordan as part of US President Barack Obama's Arab-Israeli peace push. He is due to travel to Syria later on Friday. Washington is seeking a swift renewal of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks as well as a comprehensive peace deal which not only involves Israel and the Palestinians, but Syrians, Lebanese and other surrounding countries.

Obama called President Michel Suleiman to congratulate him on the election. "These elections were an important milestone for this country. The United States remains steadfast in its support for a sovereign, free, and independent Lebanon," Mitchell said. "We look forward to continuing to build our strong bilateral relations, to working with the new government, including in the effort to bring comprehensive peace and stability in the entire Middle East," he said. Mitchell has assured the Palestinians of Washington's commitment to a state of their own, saying its establishment was the only viable to solution to their conflict with Israel.
