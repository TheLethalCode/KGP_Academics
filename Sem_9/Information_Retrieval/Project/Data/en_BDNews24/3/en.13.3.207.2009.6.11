 SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Carlos Pavon struck an early goal to give Honduras a 1-0 win over neighbours El Salvador, putting them back on course for a place at the World Cup finals. The win lifted Honduras to third in the CONCACAF World Cup qualifying tournament with seven points from five games. El Salvador are fifth with five, one below Mexico, who beat Trinidad & Tobago 2-1. The top three teams qualify directly for South Africa and the fourth plays off against the fifth-placed South American side for another place. Honduras and El Salvador, who fought a five-day war 40 years ago after a series of World Cup qualifiers fuelled existing bad feeling over Salvadorean immigrants in Honduras, are both trying to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1982. El Salvador, boosted by a shock 2-1 win over Mexico on Saturday, began brightly but it was the hosts who took the lead when 35-year-old Pavon scored from a rebound in the 14th minute. Honduras, despite missing striker David Suazo through injury, almost went 2-0 up just after halftime when Pavon's shot was cleared off the line
