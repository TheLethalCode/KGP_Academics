 CANBERRA, Fri Jun 12, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Generation Y-ers expecting parents to foot their bills could be in for a rude awakening since the economic crisis hit, according to a poll. A survey for Australia's St George Bank found almost two-thirds of Generation Y-ers -- people born from the mid 1980s to early 1990s -- are expecting their parents to help them out with their rent, their wedding and when buying a home. However, the poll found many parents were no longer in a position to fund their children, with 70 percent of "baby boomers," or people in their 50s and 60s, suffering financially as a result of the global financial crisis.

These expectations left more than 50 percent of parents feeling guilty when their children asked for help or support. Four in five parents of adult children wished their children planned for their future better and spent less on non-essential items, saved more and become more financially independent. Moore said the survey found that many Generation Y-ers just did not know how to budget or save. "One in four Gen Ys say they have never had to budget and/or save, and a further 35 percent have only done so for a short period when saving for a particular item or holiday," he said. "With the increasing pressure their parents are under with the GFC (global financial crisis), I strongly recommend that Gen Y take a more active role in managing their finances as they will be less able to turn to their parent for h
