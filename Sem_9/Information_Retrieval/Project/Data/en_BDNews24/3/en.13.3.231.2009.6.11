 Mintu Chowdhury bdnews24.com Chittagong Correspondent Chittagong, June 11 (bdnews24.com)In spite of the deaths in two landslides in consecutive rainy seasons, thousands of families continue to live in perilous settlements at the peaks, flanks, foots and on fringes of around 30 hills of the port city. Around 2,000 families are living illegally in seriously risky settlements and 4,000-5,000 families in less perilous settlements, the Department of Environment (DoE) says. "Serious damage to property and loss of life can happen if the settlers are not moved from there," said Abdus Sobhan, director of DoE. "Some influential people are behind this illegal settlement bringing the homeless to the fore," he said, quoting a survey. These settlements are not knocked down because of a lack of effective initiatives by the administration and for local influential people, said environmental activist Sharif Chouhan. "Tough implementation of the hill cutting laws is needed," he said. Nine of the 30 hills belong to Water and Sewerage Authority (Wasa), Bangladesh Railway (BR), Chittagong City Corporation (CCC), Bangladesh Police and Chittagong Medical College authorities. The most perilous areas are police line in the Kusumbagh area, hills adjacent to the Garibullah Housing Society, Wasa-controlled Motijhorna Pahar and adjacent areas, Gol Pahar adjacent to Ispahani Textile Mills, hills adjacent to the Lakeview residential areas of north Pahartoli, Tankir Pahar of Bayejid area, Siraj Shah Colony and Amin Textile, foot and rolling plains of the hills adjacent to the staff quarters of the medical college. The less perilous ones are Bishwa Colony, North Kattali Nandan Housing, Khulshi Brick Field, South Khulshi Zakir Hossain Society, South Khulshi residential area, SB Nagar, Khulshi Valley residential area, Suchana VIP residential area, Dolphin, adjacent hills of King of Chittagong Community Centre and foot and surrounding areas of Samara Hill. As many as 128 people died in landslide at the Tankir Pahar in Motijhorna area at Lalkhan Bazar, Kusumbagh area, Kaichaghena adjacent to cantonment and Lebu Bagan on June 11, 2007. A committee of experts, formed to investigate the incident, made some recommendations to stop hill cutting, take steps against those involved and settlements in the foot and flanks of the hills. But none of those has been implemented. District administration and CCC took initiatives last rainy season to shift the families but they are still there. Again, 11 people died on Aug 18, 2008 in the landslide of Tankir Pahar. Later, unsafe settlements were removed from many places, said divisional commissioner MN Siddiq. But he admitted that there were settlements in several unsafe areas. A notice has been served on BR to remove illegal settlements from the hills of north Khulshi area adjacent to Foy's Lake, said Sobhan. Soon similar notice will be served on other entities, he added. bdnew
