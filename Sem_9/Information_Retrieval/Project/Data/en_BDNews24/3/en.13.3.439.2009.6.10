 NOTTINGHAM, England, June 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sanath Jayasuriya thrashed 81 from 47 balls to set up Sri Lanka's 15-run win over West Indies on Wednesday in the teams' final group match of the Twenty20 World Cup. Both teams had already qualified for the second round. West Indies, chasing Sri Lanka's 192 for five at Trent Bridge, managed 177 for five in reply with Dwayne Bravo top-scoring with 51. They were left needing 28 from the last over. Jayasuriya, 40 this month, added 124 from 78 deliveries with opening partner Tillekeratne Dilshan, who scored an equally rapid 74 from 47 balls -- his second consecutive fifty after his 53 against Australia. Jayasuriya plundered ten fours and three sixes. West Indies fought back through medium-pacer Lendl Simmons, who claimed the first four wickets for 19 runs from three overs. He was denied the chance to become the first man to take five wickets in a T20 international when Jerome Taylor bowled the 20th over. West Indies captain Chris Gayle was rested because of a sore right knee, sustained in the match against Australia on Saturday. Sri Lanka meet Pakistan at Lord's on Friday in the Super Eight (1230GMT). West Indies play India in the later match (1630)
