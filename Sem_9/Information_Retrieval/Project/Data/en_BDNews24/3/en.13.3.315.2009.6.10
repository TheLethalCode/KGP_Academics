<TITLE> Capello ready to unleash Walcott against Andorra </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON COLNEY, England, June 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Winger Theo Walcott can play a key role in helping England beat Andorra on Wednesday and rack up seven wins from seven World Cup qualifiers, manager Fabio Capello said. "Theo will be important, we have to attack and width is very important," he said of the 20-year-old Arsenal player who missed four months of the season through injury. "He's training very well, he needs to play to recover his best condition." England made hard work of beating Andorra 2-0 in their first qualifier last September and also started slowly in Kazakhstan on Saturday. Although they won that match 4-0, it took them 38 minutes to make the breakthrough with Gareth Barry's goal. Capello looked furious at times during that game and said he had left the players in no doubt about his feelings afterwards. "Yes, I spoke to them about mistakes, about a lot of things," he told a news conference at England's training base on Tuesday. "But I think tomorrow will be a different game, we have to play in the midfield of the opponent, we have to attack." England captain John Terry added: "The main thing is we get the right result. We need to get the ball wide and move the ball quickly and we should be okay." Capello, hoping to sign off his first full season in charge with a much more convincing win at Wembley, said his first 18 months in charge had been an important learning process for both him and his men. "This experience for me and for the players this year is very important," said the man who replaced Steve McClaren after England failed to make the finals of the 2008 European Championship. "I've learned a lot and the players have also learned a lot my system, what I want them to do during games, the different styles we have played in every game. "It's the same players but we've changed it a lot. We've changed the position of the players on the pitch during the game." A victory over Andorra would leave England needing just three points from their remaining three games in Group Six to be assured of progress to next year's finals in South Africa. However, Terry remained cautious saying: "let's not get too carried away at the moment. "Hopefully, we can make it seven out of seven. But it's important the fans and the players and the press keep our feet firmly on the ground because we have done nothing yet". With Croatia, Ukraine and Belarus all fighting for second place and taking points from each other, England are virtually assured already of topping the group. "I watched them (Andorra) against Belarus on Saturday (in a 5-1 defeat) and they played 10 players in front of the box, waiting and waiting," said Capello. "It will be the same, they will wait for us in front of the box. "If you score quickly it will be an easy game but I remember in Barcelona in the first game against them it was 0-0 at halftime." A proposed strike by London Underground train staff means there is likely to be travel chaos in the Wembley area. FA officials said there would be no extra overground rail services, no extra car parking and the kickoff would remain at 19.15GMT
