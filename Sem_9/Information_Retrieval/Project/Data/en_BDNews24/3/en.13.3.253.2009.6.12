 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League government in its maiden budget has allocated Tk 700 crore to manage climate change risk. Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has pledged Tk 490 crore as budgetary support during the next three years to cope with the environment-related disasters, Muhith said in his budget speech in parliament on Thursday. "Japan has proposed to contribute Tk. 700 crore from their Japan Debt Cancellation Fund (JDCF) facility in managing the risk due to climate change." Finance minister said to counter the impending disaster we need much larger fund. I, therefore, propose an allocation of Tk. 700 crore in FY 2009-10 towards that fund. He said, as a basic strategy, the government may put forward the demand to establish rights to obtaining the status of global citizen for the affected people. The creation of a Multi-Donor Trust Fund with support from donors is in progress. The proposed Fund received a commitment of US$ 97.9 million from the Governments of UK and Denmark, he added. "A special initiative will shortly be taken to save the Buriganga from pollution." "Adequate arrangements are not available in various industrial sites to prevent environment pollution. We want the management of industrial units to take appropriate measures to properly dispose toxic industrial waste." "We will provide loans to them on easy term on this purpose. But they have to complete this task within stipulated time. "No new industrial units will be allowed to be set up in the area without putting in place an appropriate waste disposal system. At the same time, all hospital authorities will also take similar measures for disposing their clinical waste." "There is a plan to bring 20 percent of our land under afforestation programmes by 2015 to attain self-sufficiency in forest resources. We have a target to bring 4,314 hectares of land under afforestation programme, create strip gardens over an area of 2,355 kilometres and plant 23 lakh saplings." A development programme has been taken up for maintaining ecological balance and biodiversity in Sudarban area at a cost of Tk. 650 crore, he said. Total allocation for environment and forest ministry is Tk. 278 crore and it is Tk. 8882 for food and disaster management.
