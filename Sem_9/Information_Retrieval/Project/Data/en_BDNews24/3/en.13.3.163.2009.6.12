<TITLE> Budget '10: Execution is key </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 by Mamun Rashid If he had been alive, Tajuddin Ahmed, Bangladesh's first prime minister, would have been most happy today to see so much public debate on the national budget and, more importantly, what could be called a 'conscientious budget' being drafted in line with major national issues. Credit goes to our rising economic journalism, retired but `eager to speak' ex-bureaucrats, think tanksand thanks to a very articulate finance minister, the nation was almost familiar with this budget even before it was placed in parliament. We knew the outlay was going to be around BDT 114,000 crores, with revenue earnings of around BDT 80,000 crores and a BDT 34,000 deficit. We also knew the annual development programme would be about BDT 30,500 crores. We also came to know the revised budget for the outgoing fiscal would be BDT 94,000 crores with ADP being revised downward from BDT 25,600 crores to BDT 23,000 crores. We knew prices of luxury items, such as cars and air conditioners would go up. We knew the government would encourage large companies to float shares in the capital market and do everything to revitalise agriculture and rural Bangladesh. So, what was new on Thursday? Public private partnership (PPP) or 'Digital Bangladesh'? Not really. We also knew the new government was going to refocus on PPP to drive infrastructure development. On Thursday, we came to know the government has allocated BDT 2100 crores for this. A 'Digital Bangladesh' was an election pledge of the new government. Information is power, and access to information can significantly reduce corruption while an integrated information network can ensure efficiency and transparency in the whole system. The budget speech has disclosed government eagerness to integrate all upazilas through a wide area network and subsequently deliver technology to the doorstep of the rural people. Acceptance of undisclosed money 'without any question' was also on the cards. This time the facility has been given from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2012 with a 10 percent tax and provided it is invested in the stock market, physical infrastructure or certain new industries and BMRE of units of the same industries. We needed power, bridges, development of SMEs. The FM has kept adequate allocations and policy support to augment those sectors. He has demonstrated a clear understanding of `where the shoe pinches' in Bangladesh. Eight percent GDP growth has been targeted by 2013 and 10 percent by 2017 which would be sustained until 2021. We also came to know of a target of $28 billion in FDI by 2013-14. The budget deficit is estimated to be within 5 percent of GDP of which 2 percent will be financed from external sources and the remaining 3 percent will be financed from domestic sources. In 2009, 500 MW of additional power will be generated through 4 projects under the public sector and 440 MW will be added from 11 projects under the private sector. The bidding process for the construction of a 450 MW Bibiyana Power Plant is underway. By 2013, some 2,810 MW of power will be produced through 13 projects under the public sector and another 1,350 MW, under 3 projects of the private sector including Bibiyana. The stimulus package is also to be expanded, with a provision of BDT 5,000 crore in the proposed budget. Major proposals related to tax include: Lower the age bar from 70 years to 65 years to help reduce the personal income tax burden on senior Bangladeshi citizens. There is a proposal to reduce the corporate tax rate for mobile phone operators to 35 percent subject to the condition that they are listed in the stock exchange as a publicly traded company and at least 10 percent share of the company's paid up capital is transferred. The budget proposes accepting the investment incurred for the purchase of flat or construction of house without any question by paying a tax at a specific rate according to the measurement of the flat/house. Imposition of tax on vehicle at a specified rate on the basis of engine capacity (CC) and imposition of duty on luxury import vehicles were other measures, along with increase of duty from 20 percent to 45 percent on shoes, tiles, sanitary wire, biscuits, suitcases, mosquito coil, jewellery. There is also proposal to include withdrawal of VAT exemption facility enjoyed by travel agents, indenting firms, manpower exporters, manufacturers of utensils, sanitary ware and other kitchenware made of aluminium and enamel, homeopathic, ayurvedic, unani and herbal medicine and plastic furniture. Zero rate tax rates will continue for major food items and fertilisers. A 5 percent regulatory duty against tariff lines with 25 percent customs duty on luxury items is proposed. A 25 percent customs duty on mobile phone sets on an ad valorem basis instead of existing specific duty of Tk. 300/set applied irrespective of quality and waive all existing VAT, supplementary duty and AIT is included. On the clean energy front is exemption of Solar Panel from all VAT at stages of import, domestic production and supply. The budget looks good but ambitious. An almost 33 percent increase on the ADP and 21 percent increase on the revenue budget. Very much in line with the election manifesto. But the question remains can the present political regime, local government and development administration drive this large expenditure budget to closure? If yes, where will the drive come from? What is needed is lots of energy and synergy too. We have to speak the same language, sing the same song. Is it possible? At Harvard we were referred to a book called Execution: The Discipline of Getting Things Done. After many long years, the title comes to mind again.
