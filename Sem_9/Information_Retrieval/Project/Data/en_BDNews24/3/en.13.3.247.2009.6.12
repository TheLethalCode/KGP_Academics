 JOHANNSBURG, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuter) - The Confederations Cup kicks off in South Africa on Sunday and offers Spain a chance to build on a 32-match unbeaten run and the hosts an opportunity to test their credentials ahead of next year's World Cup finals. Both sides are in Group A action on the first day with Spain facing Oceania Nations Cup winners New Zealand in Rustenburg after South Africa open the eight-team tournament against Asian champions Iraq in Johannesburg. While the Spanish will be hoping to test their credentials as a possible World Cup winner with a 14th straight triumph, South Africa know their match is the first step in a stiff examination of how competitive they will be when the world arrives in 2010. "Bafana Bafana" have been far from convincing in recent years and the prospect of a poor run at next year's tournament is seen as potentially damaging to the event. "Drawing or losing is not an option. We need three points to build added confidence, not just in the squad but among our fans," captain Aaron Mokoena told reporters on Thursday. "We are aware of the pressure on us and we are ready to meet those challenges." Scheduled to face Iraq and then New Zealand in their opening matches, South Africa were initially confident of advancing to the semi-finals but have since tempered their gusto after solid midweek performances by their opponents. Iraq impressed in a 1-1 draw with Poland in a warm-up game in Cape Town on Tuesday while New Zealand scored three times before losing 4-3 to world champions Italy in Pretoria a day later. "We underestimate them at our peril. There is no way we are going to do that," Mokoena added. New Zealand's strength at set pieces caught Italy napping but Spain are expected to be better prepared for the All Whites at the Royal Bafokeng Sports Palace, roughly 180km northwest of Johannesburg. FAVOURITES TAG A 6-0 warm-up win over Azerbaijan on Tuesday reaffirmed the Spain's status as favourites at the two-week tournament. "We are not really all that bothered about records," defender Carlos Puyol told reporters on Thursday. "We play to win and if we set records at the same time so much the better." "We earned the right to be favourites but we have to take it a step at a time. We want to continue, to keep up our confidence but we must carry on working hard," the Barcelona captain added. Spain's main competition for the trophy comes from Brazil and Italy, who play their first Group B matches on Monday. Holders Brazil open against Egypt in Bloemfontein while Italy line up against the United States a few hours later in Pretoria. The final is in Johannesburg on June 28
