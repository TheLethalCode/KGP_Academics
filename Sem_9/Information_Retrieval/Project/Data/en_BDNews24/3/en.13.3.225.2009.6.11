<TITLE> ATN Bangla land papers fake: Rajuk </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com)Private television channel ATN Bangla's claims of owning the land at 69 Gulshan Avenue have no legal basis, a Rajuk official said on Thursday. City development authority Rajdhani Unnayan Kortripakkha assistant director Mostafa Jamil Khan (estate-1) told bdnews24.com that the channel had bought the 21-katha plot from a fake owner. Abdur Rashid Khan, from whom the TV station said it had purchased the plot in March, was not the real lessee. "He was hanging around in the office with fake lease papers. He came to us. But after scrutinising the papers it was found that his papers were phony." Armed intruders broke into the home of retired civil servant Abdul Qaiyum in his 80s at around 1:30am on Wednesday and tried to forcibly evict him and his wife from their decades-old home. They overpowered the night guards, but faced stiff resistance from neighbours' security men. ATN Bangla chairman Mahfuzur Rahman purchased the land from Rashid on the company's behalf, Saiful Bari, spokesperson for the TV station, said on Wednesday. According to document shown by Bari, they bought the 21-katha plot for Tk 2.25 crore, but according to current market price each katha of land in upscale Gulshan neighbourhood costs about Tk 2 crore. Bari showed Rajuk the service charge receipt as the proof of ownership by Abdur Rashid but could not show any lease papers. "The number of the plot is CWOS (A) 13. However, RAJUK has changed the number. Rashid has taken the house as lease from the RAJUK and it has not been handed over to him (Rashid) as well." "But no one from ATN Bangla tried to illegally grab the house; those who did so are not associated with ATN Bangla," said Bari. He said a signboard seized by police bearing ATN Bangla's name was not theirs. Asked why they bought the land whose ownership had been disputed, Bari said most of the lands had complications over ownership. Even though Bari claimed that Rashid himself had not been handed over the house, the land documents say Rashid had been living in that house. Qaiyum, who began his civil service career in the colonial era, retired as chairman of BIWTA in the Pakistan days and is widely respected among neighbours. A number of neighbours alleged police complicity in the whole affair. "They were refusing to arrest the 11 already tied up by the guards," alleged one. "And when my son called the OC, the officer was clearly reluctant to respond, pretending he did not know where the place of occurrence could be," the neighbour said. "This is absolutely unacceptable ... how can this happen in the middle of the night? And on Gulshan Avenue?" fumed another neighbour, who saw at the first hand much of what followed the abortive bid to oust the helpless couple. "This is daylight robbery in the middle of the night," a Qaiyum relative said. Police arrested 11 of the assailants, but at least four managed to escape. A metropolitan magistrate on Wednesday gave Gulshan police two days to question the 11 detainees. A number of witnesses said police appeared "reluctant to respond". Qaiyum's nephew Ruhul Quader told bdnews24.com the attackers had entered the house by breaking down the doors. But four of the raiders were detained by guards from the house next door, belonging businessman Abdul Awal Mintoo, a former FBCCI president. The other seven were overpowered inside Qaiyum's house compound. The eighty-seven year old Qaiyum said: "We bought this house and have been living in it since 1970. How could this happen?" Salman F Rahman, former FBCCI president and Qaiyum's relative, went to the scene after he was informed of the incident. The Qaiyum family said a general diary had already been registered with the Gulshan police by ATN Bangla, which claimed the house belonged to the TV station. "The attackers came with a huge signboard," said a neighbour. The board, still propped up in the driveway hours later, read: 'ATN Bangla have bought and own this plot 3WS(A)69'. How it all happened Shafiqul Islam, a guard of the house of Qaiyum, told bdnews24.com that a few people knocked at the main gate while two to three men got over the wall, held him hostage and opened the gate. Some eight to 10 armed people with black clothes wrapped around their faces got down inside the house complex from a microbus, which had no number plate, Shafiqul said. Qaiyum's domestic help Razia Begum said that assailants were armed with rods, hockey sticks, machetes, knives and firearms. The intruders took Qaiyum to the microbus and also tried to take his wife out of the house. They vandalised the furniture of the house, she said. Ruhul Quader, a relative of the Qaiyums, said as neighbours came out, the intruders tried to flee. Seven of them were arrested from Qaiyum's house and four others from Abdul Awal Mintu's house. Ruhul said the ATN Bangla authorities filed a general diary with Gulshan Police Station a few days back, claiming that the house belonged to the TV station. Harun-Or-Rashid, assistant police commissioner of Gulshan Zone, said the ATN Bangla chairman, Mahfuzur Rahman, claimed the house to be his and mentioned Quaiyum as tenant in the diary. Ruhul said police officers 'Sharif' and Hasan Mahmud from Gulshan Police Station had came to the house two to three days back and said Qaiyum was not the owner but a tenant. They wanted to talk with Qaiyum. bdnew
