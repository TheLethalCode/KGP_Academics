<TITLE> Rifts in BNP because of competition: Mosharraf </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 14 (bdnews24.com)BNP is experiencing ripples of conflict as competition heats up among its young leaders vying for positions in the organisational ladder, senior party policymaker Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain has said. "Once the effective leadership pattern emerges through the councils, there will an end to such conflicts," Mosharraf, a national standing committee member, told reporters at his Segunbagicha office on Sunday. "The convening committees are an interim arrangement. Around the convening committees at a few places, some leadership crises have been reported, which will be soon resolved." Questioned whether there would be change in the post of secretary general, Mosharraf said, "The chairperson only can appoint or change a secretary general. I, however, will welcome any proposal of selecting a secretary general through the central council." The former minister alleged that the ruling Awami League-led alliance was keeping the opposition from joining the ongoing parliamentary session unfortunately. Main opposition BNP is staying away over a seating arrangement dispute. To the government, a seat in the front row in parliament is more precious than the main opposition's presence, he said. "Since you have all the seats in parliament, can't you forego only one front row seat and have BNP in the House?" he asked the government: BNP will make a documentary film highlighting projections of probable damages the much discussed dam India proposes to erect at Tipaimukh might wreak on Bangladesh rivers downstream and the environment in general, Mosharraf said. The film will be screened at home and abroad to sensitise people everywhere of the threats the proposed dam poses. He told reporters that the standing committee at a meeting on Saturday discussed the Tipaimukh menace and the construction of the Asian Highway. b
