 BUENOS AIRES, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Argentina's latest away defeat in South American World Cup qualifying has left them looking nervously over their shoulders at a pack of teams who are closing in behind. Beaten 2-0 in Ecuador on Wednesday amid growing doubts over Diego Maradona's coaching abilities, Argentina remained in the top four where they need to finish to qualify directly for South Africa. But their five-point cushion over fifth placewhich would force them into a two-leg playoff against the fourth team from CONCACAFhas been eaten away. Ecuador are lurking only two points behind on 20, Uruguay have 18 and Colombia and Venezuela 17 each. Worryingly for Maradona, Argentina's run-in features three of the toughest matches in the 18-game campaign. They host a rampant Brazil in September and face a tricky visit to third-placed Paraguay, who have become direct rivals for a place. After a straightforward game at home to table-propping Peru in October, they finish their 18-match programme at arch-rivals Uruguaythe last place they would want to go needing a win. "We've put ourselves under pressure again and now we have to concentrate on beating Brazil," said Maradona. AUSTRALIA PLAYOFF It is the first time Argentina have struggled since South America's current system of qualifiers, in which all the teams play each other twice, was introduced for the 1998 World Cup. Four years ago, Argentina qualified with three games to spare and in 2002, when an identical fixture list was used, a 2-0 win in Ecuador sealed their place in Japan and South Korea. Having suffered in the shorter formats used previously, Argentina are big supporters of the present system which is often criticised by European clubs because of the number of transatlantic trips their South American players have to make. In 1993, Argentina were forced into a two-leg playoff against Australia after finishing second in a four-team group behind Colombia who memorably beat them 5-0 in Buenos Aires. Back in 1969, they failed to qualify altogether from a three-team group which also featured Bolivia and Peru. Most commentators agreed there was a general improvement in Wednesday's performance compared to Saturday's 1-0 home win over Colombia, when Maradona's team were in complete disarray. The midfield formation, with Fernando Gago and Sebastian Battaglia in front of the defence, Maxi Rodriguez on the right and Jonas Gutierrez on the left, worked well for the first 70 minutes when Argentina created more chances than the hosts. But they were made to pay for dreadful finishing which included a Carlos Tevez penalty miss in the first half. Maradona admitted he had no idea how he would face the Brazilians. "I don't know what we're going to do between here and the airport, let alone in three months time," he was quoted as saying by the Clarin newspaper
