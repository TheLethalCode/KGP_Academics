 Liton Haider bdnews24.com chief crime reporter Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com)Armed intruders, claiming to be from a private TV station, sought to forcibly occupy a valuable Gulshan Avenue property in the small hours of Wednesday morning by dislodging an octogenarian couple from their decades-old home. The gang, alleging "ATN Bangla owns the property", broke into the home of retired civil servant Abdul Qaiyum at around 1.30am and tried to overpower the night guards, but faced stiff resistance from neighbours' security men. Police arrested 11 of the assailants, but at least four managed to escape. A number of witnesses said police appeared "reluctant to respond". Qaiyum's nephew Ruhul Quader told bdnews24.com, at the scene, he was woken by a call just after 1.30am. "My cousin Shireen (Alam Cowdhury, Qaiyum's daughter) was screaming for help. She said 10-15 armed intruders had broken into the family house with knives and iron bars." Ruhul said when he got to the house at 69 Gulshan Avenue the front gate was smashed and a maroon microbus, with number plates removed, was parked in the driveway. The attackers had entered the house by breaking down the doors. "They were holding my uncle in the front seat of the vehicle and were trying to force my aunt to get in too." Some of the men had black cloths covering their faces, he said. But neighbours and nearby security guards had gathered by then to confront the attackers, chasing them down. Four of the raiders were detained by guards from the house next door, belonging businessman Abdul Awal Mintoo, a former FBCCI president. The other seven were overpowered inside the Qaiyum house compound. Police eventually arrested them. "Four still managed to escape in the microbus right in front of police," said Ruhul. At around 5am, bdnews24.com chief crime correspondent Liton Haider spoke to a frail Qaiyum. After a three-hour ordeal, the eighty-seven year old had only the strength to say: "We bought this house and have been living in it since 1970. How could this happen." His wife Mahbuba Qaiyum was too upset to speak. The Qaiyum family says a general diary had already been registered with the Gulshan police by ATN Bangla, which claimed the house belonged to the TV station. "The attackers came with a huge signboard," said a neighbour. The board, still propped up in the driveway hours later, read: 'ATN Bangla have bought and own this plot 3WS(A)69'. Qaiyum, who began his civil service career in the colonial era, retired as chairman of BIWTA in the Pakistan days and is widely respected among his neighbours, a number of whom alleged police complicity in the whole affair. "They were refusing to arrest the 11 already tied up by the guards," alleged one. "And when my son called the OC, the officer was clearly reluctant to respond, pretending he did not know the address," the neighbour said. "This is absolutely unacceptable ... how can this happen in the middle of the night? And on Gulshan Avenue," fumed another neighbour who had witnessed the night's events. "This is daylight robbery in the middle of the night," a Qaiyum relative said. No one from ATN Bangla could be reached immediately for comment
