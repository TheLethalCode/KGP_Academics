<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com)Tax holidays will not be extended after 2012, every industry will have to pay some level of tax after that period, according to AMA Muhith's new budget. "Tax holidays act as an impediment to the taxpaying culture," the finance minister told parliament in his budget speech Thursday. "So, this existing system of tax holiday, which remains in force until 2012, shall not be extended any further," he proposed. Muhith said it would be more appropriate to replace existing tax holidays with tax incentives. He said it would more enable an environment for industrialisation, investment and job creation in the country. A reduced tax rate for certain sectors which would vary for newly established industries from location to location has been also proposed in the budget. According to the proposed new budget, new industries in Dhaka and Chittagong divisions except Rangamati, Bandarban and Khagrachhari would have to pay taxes at 5 percent for the first and second year, 10 percent for the third and fourth year and 15 percent in the fifth year. In Rajshahi, Khulna, Sylhet, Barisal divisions and in the hill tracts of Chittagong division the figure would be 5 percent for the first three years, 10 percent for the following three years and 15 percent in the seventh year.
