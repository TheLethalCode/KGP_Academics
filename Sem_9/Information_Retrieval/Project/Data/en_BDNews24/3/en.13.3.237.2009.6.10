<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com)The government has said it will form a committee to explore the reasons behind the disastrous performance of the national cricket team in the ICC World Twenty20 in England. "We will look into the matter of Bangladesh's losses in the Twenty20 World Cup," Chittagong Hill Tracts affairs minister Dipankar Talukdar told parliament on Wednesday, on behalf of the state minister for youth and sports, who was absent. "Bangladesh are also due to play in the upcoming 2011 World Cup, and the government will take the measures to keep the nation's honour up," Talukdar said in reply to a query from Awami League MP Mostaq Ahmed Ruhi. Bangladesh were miserably knocked out of the series after a six-wicket defeat to ICC associate member Ireland and a 25-run loss to defending champions India. A dejected team returned home Wednesday morning after their disappointing campaign. Ireland broke the Tigers' hearts, handing them a comprehensive wicket defeat to dash their hopes of playing the Super Eights, a place Bangladesh qualified for in the inaugural World Twenty20 in South Africa. Bangladesh, who also went down against India in the first match of the series, were the first team to land in the host country and the first to catch the return flight home. They arrived at Zia International Airport minus Australian coach Jamie Siddons, captain Mohammad Ashraful and all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan. Siddons returned to Australia to accompany girlfriend Kim, who is expected to give birth of their first child next week while Ashraful and Shakib stayed back in England for treatment. Shakib had a pre-appointment with a doctor but Ashraful surprisingly informed the team management that he needed to visit an eye specialist. Vice captain Mashrafee Bin Mortaza was left to face the heat from the national media on their return. Asked the reasons behind the defeat against Ireland, Mashrafee's reply was simple. "We went down against Ireland as we could not play better." "The batsmen did not click properly, which resulted in a top order slump and the team never recovered from that early pressure," said Mashrafee. When asked about Siddons' comment, that "our boys tend to do things their way a lot, they don't listen that well and it is time some pressure is put on them to listen, from the captain down", Mashrafee said that he had no idea about that. But he remembered to give the well-worn statement after a disappointing performancehe promised that they would "learn from the mistakes and do better next time." bdnew
