 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com)The SSC examinations in the next year will have two subjects tested in the newly proposed creative questions system (CQS ) and in 2011, another two subjects will be included, the education minister has said. According to a previous decision, the system was to be followed for tests in all subjects for the SSC exams in 2011. In the next year's SSC exams, tests in Bangla and Religious Studies papers will be taken as per the new system, Nurul Islam Nahid said on Thursday at a press conference at the education ministry. "In 2011, another two subjects will be added to Bangla and Religious Studies papers," said Nahid. The minister further said geography and general science in the humanities stream, business studies and general science in the commerce stream, and social science and chemistry in the science stream would be included in the 2011 SSC exams. The parliamentary standing committee on the education ministry on June 2 recommended the introduction of the much discussed 'creative questions system' in the SSC examinations, taking tests in only two subjects next year and increase subjects in phases. The ministry had decided in April last year to introduce the 'new system' next year starting with Bangla paper I and religious studies to improve the quality of education. It was also decided then to apply the method to all the subjects while holding the 2011 SSC exams. Many of the guardians, however, had been opposing the new proposition saying that that the examinees were yet not ready for it. Under the CQS, the test paper will have two parts: one section will carry questions framed in the current system and the other will be meant to test an examinee's analytical capacity. An analytical question will have four parts againthe purpose of which should be to promote creative genius. Rashed Khan Menon, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on education, education secretary Syed Ataur Rahman, joint secretary Moyezuddin Ahmed, secondary and higher secondary education director general professor Nomanur Rashid and Dhaka board chairman Md Shamsul Haque were present at the media briefing. bdne
