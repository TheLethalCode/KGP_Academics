<TITLE> BGMEA slams 'money whitening culture' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jun 14 (bdnews24.com)The culture of allowing 'black money to be whitened' should come to an end, readymade garment exporters said on Sunday, though they did not go so far as to demand the scope offered in the new budget. "Undisclosed money is being encouraged as repeated scopes are being given to legalise it How long will it continue?" said BGMEA president Abdus Salam Murshedi. "We would want it to come to an end this time," he said at a post-budget press conference in the capital. The last three governments have offered scope to legalise undisclosed income by paying a penalty. The Awami League-led government in its proposed budget for the coming year has also offered the 'black money' amnesty, but this time for an unprecedented three-years stretch. Finance minister AMA Muhith has levied a 10 percent tax and set the condition that the money must be invested in the capital market, industry or physical infrastructure projects. Murshedi said it will have "negative" impacts, but the association will not ask the government to cancel the offer. He recommended the government create a transparent tax system, through which it would net more taxes. The BGMEA president also criticised the proposed budget saying that it has neglected the export sector. "Although the government has allocated Tk 3,424 crore in combating the global economic slump, there is no specific allocation for readymade garments, on which around two crore people depend for their livelihoods," said Murshedi. He said 63 garment houses have already collapsed due to the recession, while 200 more on the edge. There was no specific direction in the budget on the allocation of Tk 5,000 crore as assistance for the recession-hit institutions, he added. bdne
