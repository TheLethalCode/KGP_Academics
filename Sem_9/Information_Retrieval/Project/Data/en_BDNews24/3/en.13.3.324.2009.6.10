<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com)Opposition BNP leader Moudud Ahmed on Wednesday said those who harassed and persecuted politicians during the 2007-2008 emergency rule should be named and put on trial. He agreed with law minister Shafiq Ahmed's remarks that the caretaker government had harassed and persecuted politicians. "Those who were behind and involved with such oppressions must be tried," said Moudud, a former law minister and now an MP. Shafiq had blamed 'joint forces' for harassing politicians during the last caretaker government regime, saying they commandeered the Anticorruption Commission to serve the purposes of the past caretaker government. "The Anticorruption Commission filed cases against politicians at the instruction of joint forces," the minister told reporters after meeting the EU Troika delegates on Tuesday. The ACC had no other alternative then than suing the politicians, Shafiq added The BNP leader said both the prime minister and the opposition leader were jailed then. A number of politicians were not only arrested, but were also physically tortured. "Those violations should be tried in the court," said Modud, an MP, also. He himself was persecuted while in the custody of the joint forces, he admitted. The former law minister said, "Some military officers having wrong notions tarnished the image of our army during the emergency by implementing their own agenda." "Those officers must be identified and tried in the court of law, which may be possible if the government is keen enough to do that. We are ready to cooperate with them in this case." He also demanded that a White Paper delineating the caretaker government's rule be published. b
