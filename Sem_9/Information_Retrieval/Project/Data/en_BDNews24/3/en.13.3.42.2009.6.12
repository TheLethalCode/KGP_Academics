 KARACHI, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's former chief selector, Abdul Qadir, said on Friday he resigned because of high-level interference which undermined the team. Qadir, who abruptly resigned last week while Pakistan was in England for the ICC World Twenty20 tournament, also accused captain Younis Khan and Shoaib Malik of encouraging divisions within the team. "I resigned because I was not allowed to work indepedently. There was too much interference from the board chairman and by the team management. I cannot work in such conditions," Qadir told a news conference at his home in Lahore on Friday. Qadir, 53, a leg-spinner who appeared in 67 tests and 104 one-day internationals, said Pakistan would struggle to compete because of interference that ignored the views of selectors. Meanwhile, a senior official of the Pakistan Cricket Board told Reuters they had fined all-rounder Abdul Razzaq 500,000 rupees ($6,000) for playing in the unofficial Indian Cricket League (ICL). Razzaq, 29, who recently resigned from the ICL, flew to England on Friday to join the national team in the super eights stage of the Twenty20 tournament, replacing injured pace bowler Yasir Arafat. He is the first of the players who played in the ICL to be reinstated for international cricket
