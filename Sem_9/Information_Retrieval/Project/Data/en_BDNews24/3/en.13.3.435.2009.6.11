 LONDON, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Italian Fabio Capello refused to speculate on England's World Cup chances following their 6-0 demolition of Andorra on Wednesday, despite the obvious improvement in the 16 months since his first match in charge. Victory maintained England's perfect record in Group Six with seven wins from seven matches, meaning they only need three points from their last three qualifiers to ensure their place in next year's finals in South Africa. It would need a monumental collapse of form for England not to reach the finals but still Capello would not be drawn. "It is too far away," he said. "But tonight we were very strong. We created two chances to score before Wayne Rooney's first goal. Always when you play against a team that isn't strong you have to win the ball back and we did this." Rooney scored twice to take his international tally to 24 and become the first player since Gary Lineker in 1990-91 to score 10 competitive goals in a season for England. Jermain Defoe also scored twice with Frank Lampard and Peter Crouch scoring one each. The improvement over England's opening qualifier against Andorra in Barcelona last September was also evident. Then, they failed to score until the second half in a 2-0 win but on Wednesday they were 3-0 up by half-time. "We did not start so well against Andorra and we suffered," he said. "We couldn't score in the first half but, step by step we have moved on and improved." Skipper John Terry praised David Beckham after the 34-year-old made his 100th start for England and won his 112th cap. "Some of his passes were so good, they were some of the best I have ever seen," said Terry, who added that the team wanted to give the fans who battled through a Tube strike something to celebrate. "I am delighted he is in the team and I am sure the fans who got here despite the Tube strike loved it.
