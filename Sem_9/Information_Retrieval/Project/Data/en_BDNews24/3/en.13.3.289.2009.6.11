Muhith proposed to set up a new court styled National Tax Tribunal and listed plans to make more people pay. He proposed to "lower the age bar from 70 years to 65 years to help reduce the personal income tax burden on senior Bangladeshi citizens". "I also propose to keep income emanating from Pensioners' Savings Certificates tax free," he said. "Revenue from imports is going down significantly for various reasons.
