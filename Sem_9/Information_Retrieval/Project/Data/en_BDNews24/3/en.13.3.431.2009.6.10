<TITLE> Top judge in Russia's volatile Ingushetia shot dead </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, June 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gunmen firing automatic weapons shot a top judge Wednesday in Russia's troubled republic of Ingushetia as she was driven through town, Russian news agencies said, the latest attack in the mainly Muslim North Caucasus. The deputy chairwoman of the supreme court of Ingushetia, Aza Gazgireyeva died later in hospital after her car was attacked in Ingushetia's largest town of Nazran Wednesday morning, the agencies reported. The gunmen opened fire on the car carrying Gazgireyeva at 08.40 local time (0440 GMT), injuring bystanders before escaping in two cars, state-run Itar-Tass news agency quoted a local interior ministry official as saying. "Aza Gazgireyeva was a judge with 25 years experience ... the reason for her murder was her professional activities," Supreme court chairman Mikhail Zadvornov was quoted by Interfax news agency as saying. As security in Ingushetia's neighboring republic of Chechnya has improved, instability has worsened elsewhere in the region. Violence by Islamic insurgents against the authorities has increased in Ingushetia and Dagestan this year, where poverty and tough government crackdowns have provided a fertile recruiting ground for militants. In a spate of attacks, a sniper killed Dagestan's interior minister last Friday at a wedding celebration and gunmen shot dead two people Tuesday -- hours after President Dmitry Medvedev had sought to rally officials there in their fight against Islamic insurgents. Medvedev described the assassination of the interior minister as a "cynical challenge to the authorities" and ordered officials to track down the killers. Analysts say Moscow's fragile control over the mainly Muslim North Caucasus region could be undermined as the sharp economic downturn hits an already poor area.
