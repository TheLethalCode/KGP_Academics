 LONDON, June 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa edged New Zealand by one run in an exciting if ultimately meaningless Twenty20 World Cup Group D match at Lord's on Tuesday. Both teams had already qualified for the second round at the expense of Scotland and the result made no difference to the draw for the Super Eight. South Africa, defending a meagre total of 128 for seven after reaching 61 for one in 10 overs, fought their way tenaciously back into the match after New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum looked to be winning the contest for the Kiwis. McCulllum was deputising again for Daniel Vettori who decided to rest his sore left shoulder for a second match in succession. After McCullum's dismissal for 57 with the score 93 for four off 17 overs, New Zealand lost momentum. Fifteen from the final over bowled by left-arm paceman Wayne Parnell proved just too much even though Jacques Kallis spilled a catch at long-off off Jacob Oram. Sri Lanka play West Indies and defending champions India face Ireland in the last group matches at Trent Bridge on Wednesday (1230) with all four teams already assured of places in the second round
