 SRINAGAR, Fri Jun 12, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - As violence ebbs in Kashmir, the government is planning to withdraw some troops from towns across the disputed Himalayan region, the country's home minister said on Friday. Kashmir is a core issue between rivals India and Pakistan, and tens of thousands of people have been killed in the mainly Muslim region since a rebellion against Indian rule broke out there in 1989. A partial withdrawal would mark the first troop reduction in the region's urban areas since separatists started their campaign 20 years ago. "It is our intention to redraw the lines of responsibilities. The army holds the responsibility for conventional defence at the borders and for fighting infiltration," Home Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram told a news conference.

Chidambaram's comments came after the rape and deaths of two Kashmiri Muslim women, allegedly by security forces triggered large anti-India protests across the region. One protester has died and hundreds have been injured in the protests. Police say medical tests confirmed the rape and murder of the pair aged 17 and 22, but they are still looking for the culprits. Experts described India's decision to cut troops as a sign of changing times. "A strong new government in Delhi is feeling confident to deal with the Kashmir problem," said Masood Ahmed, a Srinagar-based political analyst. "It does not surprise me as violence has nearly disappeared in Kashmir and that is why they are thinking of cutting down tro
