 Dhaka, June 15 (bdnews24.com)  Former Transparency International, Bangladesh chairman professor Muzaffer Ahmed on Monday asked prime minister Sheikh Hasina to side with the people on the issue of Tipaimukh dam project. "People elected you to protect the interest of the country. Don't forget their interest. You have to take position against the construction of Tipaimukh dam alongside the people." "The dam project has turned into a life-threatening problem for us. It is not a political issue," he told a seminar on 'Tipaimukh dam: responsibilities of Bangladesh'. "All of us will have to protest against the project and launch a movement. Those who are on behalf of the project are not the friends of the country," Muzaffer said. The project will destroy the water sources and resources. The land, biodiversity and human resources will also be endangered. Not only Bangladesh many Indian states including Mizoram will be affected. People in Mizoram form human chains and rallies every day but neither the Bangladeshi nor the Indian media report them. "One can see the news on the websites of Mizoram," Muzafer said. He asked all to raise public awareness and hold protest rallies against the move. The ex-TIB chairman asked the MPs and cabinet members to work in the interests of the people. "I request you who do not want to protect the interest of the country to quit the position." Surma Kushiara Meghna Banchao Andolan organised the seminar at National Press Club. b
