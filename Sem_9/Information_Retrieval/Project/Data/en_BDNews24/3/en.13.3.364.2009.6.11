<TEXT>
 QUITO, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Carlos Tevez missed a first-half penalty as Argentina slumped to a 2-0 defeat away to Ecuador in their World Cup qualifier on Wednesday. Left-back Walter Ayovi, with a superb 25-metre strike, and Pablo Palacios scored in the last 20 minutes to hand Argentina their second defeat in four World Cup qualifiers under Diego Maradona. Lionel Messi also squandered a superb early chance for Argentina, who at least improved on their 6-1 defeat to Bolivia in another high altitude match in April. Despite the result at 2,800 metres above sea level, Argentina remained in the top four of the 10-team South American group with 22 points from 14 games while Ecuador jumped to fifth place on 20 points. The top four in the 10-team group qualify directly for South Africa and the fifth plays off over two legs against the fourth team from CONCACAF. "The didn't do anything in the first half," Maradona told reporters. "In the second half, they got a couple of rebounds and they scored two goals. "If we had scored a goal, it would have finished the game off." Ecuador coach Sixto Vizuete said: "These three points are worth their weight in gold and we're satisfied because we beat great opponents." OUTSTANDING CHANCE Messi wasted an outstanding chance after 10 minutes when he side-footed Gabriel Heinze's low cross wide of the goal from six metres. Argentina had an even better chance when Tevez was upended by Ecuador goalkeeper Marcelo Elizaga just inside the penalty area and referee Carlos Chandia pointed to the spot. Argentine-born Elizaga escaped the red card, even though he was the last man when he lunged at Tevez, and then saved Tevez's weak penalty by diving low to his left in the 28th minute. Messi, who fired over from the rebound, then created another chance with a solo run but shot into the side-netting. Ecuador's best first-half efforts were long-range shots from Jefferson Montero and Antonio Valencia. Ecuador took control after halftime and continued to try their luck from long-range as Ayovi tested Mariano Andujar with a dipping free kick and Segundo Castillo forced him to turn a powerful drive around the post. The hosts broke through when Argentina lost possession and Palacios laid the ball into the path of Ayovi who scored with a rising shot from 25 metres. Substitute Palacios fired home the second from inside the penalty area with seven minutes left before Valencia hit the post with another long-range effort in injury-time
