 Dhaka, June 14 (bdnews24.com)The main opposition BNP will not go to the parliament unless it is offered a 'respectable number' of seats and the issue of party chairperson Khaleda Zia's cantonment house is resolved, the opposition chief whip has said. "It is an unprecedented move to offer seats of the opposition to the ministers," Zainal Abdin Farroque told reporters on Sunday at the parliament's media centre. "We have told the speaker to offer us seats in the front row. Many of our MPs sit in the back row," Farroque said. "But, we have received no good answer from the speaker on the issue." Farroque also alleged that the speaker had not resolved the issue of the parliament's daily agenda for opposition chief Khaleda's house. Her personal doctors and staffers were being stopped entering her house in Dhaka Cantonment and using her car allotted from the parliament, he also alleged. "Under this circumstance, we believe there is no environment (for us) to be back in the parliament." The government is virtually withdrawing police security from the chairperson's political office in Gulshan, Farroque further alleged. The BNP wants to go to the parliament and also wants to cooperate the government. But, the government party does not want so." The BNP has been absent from parliament demanding more seats in the front row though budget session started on June 4. The speaker allotted one more seat but the party wants at least four front-row seats. b
