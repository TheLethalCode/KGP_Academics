 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com)The government has allocated Tk 4,310 crore to the power and energy sector in the proposed budget for FY 2009-10, a 48 percent jump on last fiscal year's revised budget, in a desperate bid to rev up the energy-starved growth engine. "Our development efforts are severely constrained by the dismal state of the energy and power sector," hfnance minister Abul Mal Abdul Muhith told parliament on Thursday in his budget speech. He said prime minister Sheikh Hasina's new administration was considering setting up a government-financed 1,000 MW nuclear power project at Roopur. "Only 45 percent of our entire population has access to power. Currently, our per capita power consumption is only 172 kwh, which is 325 kwh in Sri Lanka, 408 kwh in Pakistan and 665 kwh in India," the minister said. "At present, our average power demand is about 5,000 MW, against which as of now the existing power plants can only generate 3800 MW of electricity." "We are determined to take appropriate steps to increase power generation assuming its demand to be 20,000 MW by 2021." In 2008, there had been an additional power generation of 307 MW in the private sector. In 2009, 500 MW of additional power will be generated through four projects under the public sector and 440 MW will be added to the national grid from 11 projects under the private sector. "If we go ahead as planned, we hope that by 2013, 2,810 MW of power will be produced through 13 projects under public sector and another 1,350 MW, under 3 projects of private sector," Muhit hsaid. "Besides, we are continuing dialogue with our neighbouring countries to import power for mitigating the power crisis on a short term basis." The minister said the government took up a Tk. 105 crore project to produce energy-saving bulbs to save 350 MW electricity. "Additional 837 kilometres of power grid line, 17 sub-stations and 15,000 kilometres of distribution line will be constructed." "The gas reserve in the country is depleting. At present, the proven reserve of gas is 7.3 TCF while the probable reserve is 5.5 TCF." "It is, therefore, important to take up the task of on-shore and off-shore exploration to increase the gas reserve." The government was mulling over a Gas Development Fund to enhance the capacity of BAPEX for exploration of oil and gas and an Energy and Coal Policy is nearing finalisation, the finance minister said.
