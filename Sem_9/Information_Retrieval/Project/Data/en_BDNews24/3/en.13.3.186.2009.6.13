 LONDON, June 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United have tabled offers for Wigan Athletic's Ecuador winger Antonio Valencia, the Premier League club's chairman Dave Whelan has said. "They (United) have been in touch with us and we will be starting negotiations very shortly, I would imagine," Whelan told Sky Sports News when asked about Valencia. "United have been in touch with us over Antonio for the last two or three months, expressing an interest and actually putting cash offers on the table. "Those things have got to be picked up now. I think they were waiting to see if Ronaldo actually went to Real, which has happened." United said on Thursday they had accepted an 80 million pound ($132 million) bid for Ronaldo from Real Madrid. The 23-year-old Valencia, who has featured 34 times for his country, plays in a similar position to the Portugal winger. British media said on Saturday that Valencia would command a fee of about 17 million pounds. "Things will develop over the next seven to 14 days," added Whelan. "The master, which is (United manager) Sir Alex (Ferguson), he makes his moves when he is ready. Whelan said he was not desperate to sell Valencia. "If I can keep that lad, I'm going to keep him. He is one brilliant player. "So there is no pressure on me, or our football club to sell him. If Man United don't want to make a (written) offer, I'll be delighted and we will have him in our team next season." However, Whelan added he would not stand in Valencia's way if he wanted to move to Old Trafford. "If Antonio Valencia says to me, 'Chairman, I want to go to Manchester United' and we get the right fee, the deal will be done.
