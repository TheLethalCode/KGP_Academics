<TEXT>
 MADRID, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid's bid of 80 million pounds ($132 million) for Cristiano Ronaldo generated some sharp criticism in Spanish internet posts on Thursday, with many commentators slamming the club for spending outrageous sums in the middle of a severe recession. Coming just days after Real president Florentino Perez paid around 67 million euros ($94.02 million) for Brazilian Kaka, the move for Ronaldo prompted widespread anger in a country with an unemployment rate of 18.1 percent, the highest in the European Union.

Either it's one of the greats or it's not Madrid. "What Florentino is doing seems positive to me," Leonidas III wrote on El Mundo. "Or have all you others done more in your life than he has? Do you think he doesn't know what he's doing?" EmiCR7 wrote on El Mundo that Real had to buy players like Kaka and Ronaldo if they wanted to generate the most revenue. "Florentino is unique in this and will turn Madrid into a club with income of more than 600 million euros." But the overwhelming majority of posts were critical. "From an (as of today) ex-soccer fan it seems to me both immoral and an insult to people's intelligence," Frankie wrote on El Mundo. "Where have soccer's sporting values gone? Far, far away.
