<TITLE> Warne takes aim at Buchanan for helping English </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SYDNEY, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Australia leg spinner Shane Warne has taken a swipe at his old coach John Buchanan's decision to work in England. Buchanan recently accepted a job to coach some of England's best young players although he will not be directly helping England's senior players in the upcoming Ashes series. Warne was an outspoken critic of Buchanan's methods in the past and could not resist taking another shot at his fellow Australian for helping out the English. "I think that's a great move because that means we've got more of a chance," Warne told reporters Friday. "Hopefully Buck (Buchanan) will be doing his stuff and he'll be working and doing all his things and hopefully overcomplicating things. "I reckon it gives our chances a big boost and makes our blokes more hungry." Warne, who retired from international cricket after the last Ashes series in Australia but still plays in the lucrative Indian Premier League, said Australia's early exit from the World Twenty20 may turn out to be a blessing. "I wish we were still in it, it's a wonderful game to play, it's an important form of the game," he said. "(But) the positive is our guys can prepare for the Ashes and just rely on those warm-up games and all the talking, focus and preparation will be on the Ashes.
