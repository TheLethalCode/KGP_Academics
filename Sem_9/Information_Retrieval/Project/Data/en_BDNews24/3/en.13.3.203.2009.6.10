 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com) Opposition chief Khaleda Zia is being provided the security as much as she deserves in accordance with the law, the home minister said on Wednesday. "The opposition leader is being provided security as per the law. It won't change in the future," Sahara Khatun told reporters at the Secretariat, a day after the BNP had alleged that the government had withdrawn police deployed for her security. Sahara also said security had been beefed up at all court premises across the country fearing the terrorist and militant attacks. She referred to the series bomb attack in 63 districts including at court premises in 2005. "That's why we have taken the precaution on being alerted to possible attacks," she said. The minister called on all to watch out for the militants and hand them to the law enforcers. She said the investigation agency would be formed as soon as possible to speed up the process for the trial for war crimes. The home, law and foreign ministries will take joint measures to this end, she added. The law ministry had previously said formation of tribunal, investigation agency and appointment of lawyers would be finalised by June 30. Earlier, Saudi Arabia's ambassador Abdullah-bin-Nasser Al Bushahi met with the home minister at her office. "We have discussed sending trained workers to Saudi Arabia, providing facilities to the Bangladeshi hajj pilgrims and ensuring facilities for the Bangladeshi workers there," Sahara said. Meanwhile, the home ministry's public relations officer Md Shahinur Miah said state minister for home Tanjim Ahmed flew to the US on Tuesday night and was expected to return home on July 7. b
