<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 12 (bdnews24.com)Finance minister A M A Muhith says reality forced the government to extend the provision for legalising black money to boost flagging investment. "Ethics lost out to expediency on the question of giving the scope to whiten black money," he told reporters, with a tinge of disappointment, at a post-budget press briefing at the National Economic Council auditorium in the capital on Friday. Muhith has in the past been consistently opposed to 'money whitening' schemes, on ethical grounds, even speaking out against it in the lead up to the budget. "I personally believe the provision for whitening the black money is unethical," he said again on Friday. "The prime minister is also against it, but politics is the highest art of compromise," he said, explaining the rationale for the move. "The cabinet discussed the issue before the budget. The opportunity has been offered on the basis of concerted opinion," said Muhith. The finance minister had harsh words for the proceeds of corruption, but at the same time stated "expediency cannot be avoided." "Black money is bred by corruption." "It is not so easy to curb corruption," the finance minister said. "But sometimes, an opportunity has to be given, so corruption can be avoided in the future." Muhith said the opportunity was given to increase investment and employment. "Considering all these things, the provision for legalising black money has been proposed," he said "But we will monitor the issue," he said, adding the provision would be totally withdrawn after 2012 if it was abused or did not lead to the expected rise in investment and employment. Agriculture minister Motia Chowdhury, planning minister AK Khandaker and information minister Abul Kalam Azad and health minister Ruhul Haq also spoke. The finance minister placed the Tk 1,14,000 crore maiden budget of the Awami Leauge-led Grand Alliance government on Thursday in parliament amid a boycott by opposition parties over a seating arrangement row. Muhith proposed "acceptance of undisclosed money without any question" during the period from July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2012 provided that a 10 percent tax is paid and it is invested in certain new industries and also in physical infrastructure facilities and shares of companies listed on stock exchange. The new industries include start-ups in textiles, garments, leather, drugs, IT enabled services and ship building. The infrastructure facilities include ports and container facilities, fly-over and elevated roads, mono and underground railways, telecoms sector except mobile phone, water and waste treatment plants and solar energy plant. The finance minister in his budget speech said the facility was being given to boost investment, employment and to create more homeowners. "We would like to open up opportunities for employment for the common man and attain economic prosperity. There are many potential sectors of our economy where investments could carry forward our efforts for change," he said in his preamble to the proposed three-year amnesty. The industries in which black money can be utilised are: agro-processing industry (fruits processing, baby corn packeting, fruit juice producing and rubber industry), textiles spinning, textile machinery, garments, leather goods, toys, furniture, information technology enabled services (ITES), drugs pharmaceuticals, light engineering, melamine, plastic products, ceramics, sanitary ware, steel, MS rod and CI sheet from iron ore, fertilizer, insecticide, pesticide, computer hardware, petrol chemicals ,agricultural machinery, boilers, basic raw materials of drugs, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, compressors, ship-building and diamond-cutting industry, shrimp-processing industry, milk-processing industry, accumulator and battery industry, tour operators, energy-saving bulb producing industry, jute goods-producing industry, recycling industry, herbal medicine, basic chemicals and dyes, cosmetics and toiletries, tourism industry, footwear, MS billet and any other category of industry as the government may by notification in the official gazette specify.
