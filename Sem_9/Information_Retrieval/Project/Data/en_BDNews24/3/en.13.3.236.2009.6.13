<TITLE> WTCC dispute to be probed </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 13 (bdnews24.com)The home ministry has formed a three-member probe body to investigate Friday's dispute over a meeting of the Water Transport Coordination Cell at Agrabad in Chittagong, a home ministry spokesperson said. "The home minister Sahara Khatun at a meeting on Saturday morning has decided to form a probe body to investigate the WTCC conflict and asked the body to submit its report within seven days," home ministry public relations officer Md Shahinoor Miah Shahin told bdnews24.com on Saturday. The WTCC began operations on Friday after dropping MP and CCCI president Mohammed Abdul Latif from the post of adviser and convenor, leading to a 'scuffle' between the MP and police when he tried to force his way into the meeting. Shipping minister Afsarul Amin and Chittagong City Corporation mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury attended the launching programme. The WTCC was formed in 2005 in association with the Coastal Ship Owners' Association and Bangladesh Cargo Owners' Vessel Owners' Association. It was stipulated at the time that the Chittagong Chamber of Commerce and Industry president and senior most vice-president would hold the post of adviser and convenor respectively. But Latif, Awami League MP from Chittagong-10, allegedly thrust himself into the post of both adviser and convenor on being elected CCCI chief eight months back. The aggrieved ship owners sat with the shipping minister who on June 3 directed senior vice president of the chamber Mohammed Abdus Salam to take the charge of convenor. Ignoring the minister's directives, Latif expressed his desire to retain the convenor's post and got related papers signed by the chamber directors. He decided to launch WTCC operations without intermediaries of the ship owners' association, while the latter went ahead with Friday's meeting without the MP. Around 10am on Friday when Latif, accompanied by some hundred supporters, attempted entering the WTCC office, the police stopped them and an altercation arose. Rebuffed by the police, the MP reportedly manhandled both Nirmalendu Bikash Chakravarti, an assistant police commissioner, and local police chief AKM Manjurul Haque. Latif, who sustained minor injuries, alleged, "Shipping minister Afsarul Amin and Chittagong mayor ABM mohiuddin Chowdhury set the police to stop me entering the WTCC office." The probe body, headed by additional secretary for home Md Golam Hossain, includes deputy inspector general of Chittagong police headquarters Mainul Rahman Chowdhury and deputy secretary for home Zakir Hossain. bdne
