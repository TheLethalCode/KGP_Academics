 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com) - It may spur growth of local industries but is not so export friendly, said business leaders in reaction to the finance minister's budget speech in parliament Thursday. "Emphasis has been laid on domestic industry in the budget," former FBCCI president Mir Nasir Hossain told bdnews24.com. The budget proposes to reduce import duty on raw materials and increase it on finished goods. "This will help our industries to grow," he said. Finance minister AMA Muhith has offered to reduce duty from seven percent to five percent on industrial raw materials. "It will make local industries more competitive in national and international markets," said Hossain. Duty would be raised on newsprint, powder milk, shoes, suitcases, finished leather goods including bags, ceramic products, particle board, plywood, mosquito coil, imitation jewellery, among others manufactured products. This encourages domestic production of these goods, said Hossain. The budget emphasises power, too, he said. Some 2,810 MW extra power production is targeted for 2013. In an unprecedented move, the budget has proposed a three year term to legalise undisclosed money at a rate of ten percent duty and providing it is invested in certain sectors including the stock market, start-up industries and physical infrastructure. "Although there is a question over such proviosions, it would be positive if undisclosed money can be channelled to the mainstream economy." The total deficit in the proposed budget has been estimated at Tk 34,358 crore, with Tk. 16755 crore to be made up by domestic bank loans. "This will create pressure on the banks if," said Islam. Not export, business friendly Former BGMEA president Anwar-ul-Alam Chowdhury Parvez believes the proposed budget is not export and business-friendly. "I have been surprised at the biggest export sectorstextiles and ready made garmentsnot having any place in the budget," he told bdnews24.com. "Sixty lakh people are directly and around two crore are indirectly employed in the sectors." "Much importance has been put on micro sectors, and major ones avoided in the budget," he said. Pointing to a huge gap between projected expenditure and earnings, he said, "It will cast a shadow over industries." "The government will have to go to banks for borrowing to fill the deficit, which means banks may show reluctance in investing in industry." "Industry is the foundation of future growth. Farm land is on the decline," said Parvez. "So, the government has to keep in mind that the economy must be carried forward by industry." On public-private partnerships, to be supported by a proposed Infrastructure Development Fund, he said, "The government should have a regulatory body in this case." "We should also see whether the policy can be more business-supportive." "None can reap benefit from these if the government aims to participate with private initiatives on an equal footing." On the government offer to offer public service employment to students after passing HSC or equivalent exams, he said, "It is very unrealistic." He said the government must view things "from a realistic angle, not a political one". "They should be going to the private sector. Job creation will be foiled if the government wants to offer them jobs," said Parvez. "But overall human resources development and social safety net aspects are positive." "And this budget sets GDP growth targets on a long-term basis, which is also good," he said. bdnew
