<TITLE> South Africa captain wants ICC ruling on Broad actions </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NOTTINGHAM, England, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa captain Graeme Smith wants the International Cricket Council to clarify whether England bowler Stuart Broad's actions are within the spirit of the game, he said on Thursday. Halfway into his bowling run-up Broad has on several occasions looked away and pointed, which can break the batsman's concentration. He repeated the gesture in Thursday's Twenty20 World Cup match at Trent Bridge, which South Africa won. "We saw it happen from the dugout and obviously discussed it," Smith told reporters. "I don't know what the rules stipulate. The match referee and umpires need to discuss that." "Whether it is in the spirit of the game is a tough one. Bowlers are trying to find different angles in terms of getting an edge but it's probably best we leave Stuart to answer that one (if it is fair). It needs clarifying," he added. England captain Paul Collingwood said it was OK with him and another way to gain an advantage in a batsman-dominated game. Cricket has made efforts in recent years to ensure fair play and certain tactics can be outlawed if they are thought to contravene the spirit of the game
