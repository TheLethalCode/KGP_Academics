 Dhaka, June 12 (bdnews24.com) Opu Munshi, 25, son of Awami League MP and former BGMEA chief Tipu Munshi, apparently committed suicide on Thursday midnight, police said on Friday. Opu's bullet-hit body was recovered from their Uttara residence. "On being informed, we went to the former BGMEA president's house in sector 5 of Uttara," Obaidur Rahman, Uttara police chief, told bdnews24.com "People there showed us to Opu's room on the first floor. The door was bolted from within. After we failed to open the door, RAB and fire brigade personnel were called in. "The door was eventually broken open at 2am on Friday, when Opu's blood-stained body was found on the bed. His father's licensed revolver was lying beside." As Opu was taken to United Hospital in Gulshan, the duty doctor there declared him dead after examination. After talking to Opu's family, police primarily guessed that it might be a case of suicide. After studying at Uttara High School, Opu had gone abroad and studied in Singapore, USA and Canada before returning home only days back. The family said that Opu had been mentally deranged and that he had been treated abroad. No case has been filed until Friday noon. b
