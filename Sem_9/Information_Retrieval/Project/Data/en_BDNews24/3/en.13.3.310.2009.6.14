<TEXT>
 LONDON, June 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Umar Gul confirmed on Saturday his right to stand among the Pakistan pace bowling giants with the first five-wicket haul by any bowler in a Twenty20 international. Gul, 25, captured five for six from three overs as Pakistan thrashed New Zealand by six wickets in their Super Eight match and was denied a fourth over and the chance for more wickets when the Kiwis were all out for 99. Gul now owns three of the best top 10 analyses in Twenty20 cricket to go with his 76 wickets at 31.34 from 18 tests. New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori said Saturday's match was the first time he had witnessed reverse swing, the art perfected by Gul's Pakistani predecessors, in a Twenty20 match. "I have never seen anybody reverse the ball after 12 overs," Vettori told a news conference. "I don't know of anybody in Twenty20 cricket who has made the ball reverse." Pakistan introduced reverse swing to test cricket through Sarfraz Nawaz and Imran Khan in the 1970s and early 1980s. The skill of making an old and battered ball move in the air in the opposite direction to conventional swing was developed into an art form in the following decade by their successors Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis. It has now been copied throughout the world and was instrumental in England's 2005 Ashes triumph over Australia. Pakistan captain Younus Khan said Gul, the sixth and final bowler used on Saturday, had the perfect action for reverse swing and had been given the ball after it had been knocked about on the field and sent flying into the crowd. "He has pace and reverse swing," Younus said. "This isn't the first time." Gul had played only nine first-class matches when called up to the Pakistan side after his country's disappointing performance in the 2003 World Cup. He is fast without possessing express pace, gets bounce off the pitch and, as well as reversing the ball, bowls an excellent yorker. Before Saturday Gul already had the second best figures in Twenty20 cricket with four for eight against Australia in Dubai this year. He was the leading bowler at the first Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa two years ago. "The yorker and changes in pace are the two big weapons in this cricket," he told the cricinfo website recently. "It is a batsman's game, but there is so much of it now that there is an opportunity to really hone these two skills.
