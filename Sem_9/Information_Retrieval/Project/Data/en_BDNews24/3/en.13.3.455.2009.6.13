 Dhaka, June 13 (bdnews24.com) -The government's proposed budget is mostly unrealistic and not wholly consistent with the Awami League's polls pledges, opposition party Jama'at-e-Islami said on Saturday. The scope for 'whitening black money' will encourage corruption, discourage regular taxpayers and increase tax evasion, the party said in a statement after a meeting of its central working committee. Jama'at, on the other hand, termed as positive the expansions of social safety net and raised allowances for widows, vulnerable women, aged and wounded freedom fighters. The minor opposition party pointed out that the small allocation for education and technology, compared to the previous budget, was not consistent with the Awami League-led alliance's election pledge to 'digitalise' Bangladesh. Jama'at made a 14-point recommendations to put in parliament for consideration.

The party incorporated its observations and recommendations in a press statement after its meeting, chaired by Jama'at chief Matiur Rahman Nizami. b
