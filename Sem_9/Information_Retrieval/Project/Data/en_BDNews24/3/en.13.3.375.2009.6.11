<TITLE> Communications to get crucial boost </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com)The planned budget allocates Tk 6100 crore to crumbling communications, a much-needed 34 percent boost over the outgoing fiscal year, and outlines an ambitious integrated transport policy with support from the newly introduced PPP initiative. "Physical infrastructure as well as the communication sectors have still to go a long way to meet our needs," said finance minister AMA Muhith in his budget speech Thursday. "The communication network that has been built (since independence) combining roads, railways, waterways and airways is neither integrated nor consistent with the socio-economic realities of the country," said Muhith. "Coordinated development" of road, rail and waterways will be undertaken through the newly introduced public-private partnership scheme, he said. Steps have already been taken to implement the construction of Padma Bridge Project at Mawa and the construction of Karnafuli Hanging Bridge projects on a priority basis, said Muhith. Feasibility studies for construction of the four-lane Dhaka-Chittagong Expressway are also well underway, he added. Modern rail In order to modernise railways, the Bangladesh Railway Sector Improvement Project is being implemented at a cost of about Tk 3,601 crore, said Muhith. The project, to be completed by 2014, will build a double-line rail track between Tongi and Bhairab Bazaar with signaling system. There is also a component to turn Bangladesh Railway into a corporate entity. A feasibility study project has been taken up for construction of an underground metro system. According to an agreement to integrate Bangladesh with the Trans-Asian railway system, the government will also consider development of both metre-guage and broad-gauge tracks along the same routes while modernizing the Bangladesh Railway. Dhaka STP The Government has approved a Strategic Transport Plan for Dhaka, said Muhith. A feasibility study project for the construction of an elevated expressway and a tunnel between Tejgaon and the Airport is under consideration. Steps have also been taken to construct the Dhaka Eastern bypass. All alternatives to reduce traffic jam will be explored carefully, he said. In order to solve the problems of public transportation in Dhaka city and to ease traffic gridlock, an existing project for circular waterways around the city will be made effective. Ports The construction of the New Mooring Container Terminal on a Supply, Operate and Transfer basis is well underway to enhance the capacity of Chittagong Port, said Muhith. Plans for setting up a deep seaport at Sonadia is well in progress. A project for procurement of cargo handling equipment and capital dredging for Mongla Port is being implemented. With a view to modernising the Mongla Port, the government has taken up a plan to construct a multi-purpose jetty with highly sophisticated facilities and to excavate the Poshur river and the harbour areas, said Muhtih. Two incomplete jetties at Mongla Port will be developed "in the long term". A decision has also been taken to operate 12 land ports under the Bangladesh Land Port Authority on a BOT basis retaining only one at Benapole under government management, said Muhith. bdn
