 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com)The United Arab Emirates said on Wednesday it will not recruit more Bangladeshis during the ongoing economic recession but promised to take people in after the Gulf nation gets over the downturn. The UAE's foreign minister Shaikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, during an eight-hour visit to Dhaka, also pledged to resolve problems Bangladeshi workers face in his country. At a joint press conference with foreign minister Dipu Moni, he said his country would invest in Bangladesh after signing deals on avoidance of double taxation and protection of investment. Nahyan had talks with prime minister Sheikh Hasina and foreign minister Dipu Moni on UAE investment in power, infrastructure, tourism and agriculture sectors. "We are very much interested in investing in tourism, but before we get into these details we have to have the right and proper dynamics, then we orgainse it. "That is why, I have mentioned the importance of having and finalising an agreement on avoidance of double taxation and the importance of finalising an agreement on protection of investment," Nahyan told reporters at the foreign ministry before leaving Dhaka for India. Dipu Moni said, "They have shown interest in investing in the infrastructure, power, agriculture, tourism and other sectors. "But the joint commission, which last met 17 years before, headed by the finance ministers, will meet sometimes before September to finalise the deals on investment protection and avoidance of double taxation," she said. "The two deals are at the final stage of signing." The bilateral trade volume between Bangladesh and the UAE is about $350 million. On recruitment of more workers, the UAE foreign minister said, "Of course, I have heard that from the foreign minister asking for more Bangladeshis to be appointed. "But for the time being, it will be very difficult to do that. As you know that the UAE economy is privately driven. "It is very difficult for us to come up with quotas or ask our private sector to bring one more national. "But I believe the Bangladeshi workers are quite professional." The minister said more Bangladeshis would be appointed after the current economic slowdown was over. "I tell you one good news that the global economic meltdown has not been as bad as many of experts have predicted. So, it may not last long," he said. He admitted that 700,000 Bangladeshi workers had been facing problems from the recruiting companies. "There are some problems. We do not undermine it anyway. "But the UAE has been taking the lead in our part of the world in solving these issues and preparing the infrastructure to ensure better way of life including health and education," he said. Nahyan said the Gulf emirate had already implemented a decision on providing workers the salaries through banks. The minister arrived in Dhaka at 12:30pm and left at 8:30pm.
