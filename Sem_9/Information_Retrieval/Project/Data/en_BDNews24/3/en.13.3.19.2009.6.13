 LONDON, June 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Dwayne Bravo produced a tremendous performance with bat and ball to help West Indies register an upset win over defending champions India in their Twenty20 World Cup second round match at Lord's on Friday. Bravo followed up his four for 38 in India's 153 for seven with an unbeaten 66 from 36 balls, ending the match with a flourish by lofting Zaheer Khan for six over extra-cover. West Indies won by seven wickets with eight balls to spare. India struggled from the outset after electing to bat in their first Super Eight match against some express bowling from Fidel Edwards. Edwards regularly exceeded 145 km an hour during his opening spell from the Pavilion End, taking two early wickets as India managed only 40 runs from the opening six overs when the fielding restrictions were in place. At 66 for four from 12.1 overs, India were in real trouble but Andre Fletcher dropped Yuvraj Singh off Bravo and the left-hander celebrated with 67 from 43 deliveries. Fifty-six came from the final five overs. West Indies captain Chris Gayle, who flayed Australia for a match-winning century in the first round, was unusually subdued after Fletcher (0) had thrown his wicket away, scoring 22 from 28 balls. Lendl Simmons (44 from 37) played some fluent shots off his legs and Bravo, haring between the wickets, lifted the tempo, adding 58 for the third wicket from 41 balls. Bravo, with West Indies requiring 45 from 30 balls, found the perfect partner in the experienced Shivnarine Chanderpaul (18 not out). Sixteen runs came from the 17th over and 15 off the 18th, setting the scene for man-of-the match Bravo's heroics
