<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 14 (bdnews24.com)  Reconditioned car dealers have urged review of the proposed new duty structure in the budget, terming it "in excess" and saying it threatened to close down businesses. Bangladesh Reconditioned Vehicles Importers and Dealers Association (BARVIDA) said most of the cars on which there are proposals to increase duty are used by the middle class. The budget, rolled out last week, proposed to cut dealer's commissions to 10 percent from 20 percent, increase advanced trade VAT to 2.25 percent with a 5 percent regulatory tax. BARVIDA says the new budget also proposes to raise duty to 101.53 percent on cars of 1000 cc and under, up by 23.55 percentage points. Duty on 1001-1500 cc SUVs and cars would be hiked by 46.46 points to 124.44 percent. It will go up 72.14 points to 208.44 percent for 1501-2000 cc. For 2001 to 2750 cc, duty will be raised 242.88 points to 437.51 percent. For SUVs and cars over 2750 cc, it will go up 395.60 points to 590.23 percent. Finance minister AMA Muhith, in his budget speech, said the new duty structure has been proposed to increase revenue collection and to discourage import of luxury cars. BARVIDA president Md Habibullah however, differed, saying most of the cars on which there are proposals to increase tax are used by the middle class. Small cars and microbuses can never be luxury cars, he told a press conference Sunday. "Cars over three to four thousand cc are luxury ones. The government can impose heavy duty on those". Habibullah said that they had some idea of the duty hikes before the budget as the finance minister gave them some hint. "But we had no idea that it would be so appalling and will lead to closure of our business." BARVIDA's secretary general, Mahbubul Haque Chowdhury, elaborated on how prices will increase given the new taxes. An additional cost of Tk 2.68 lakh would be levied for a 1300 cc Toyota Probox; Tk 3.93 lakh for a 1500 cc Toyota Corolla XG; Tk 4.12 lakh for a 1500 cc Toyota Fielder; Tk 4.37 lakh for a 1500 cc Toyota Allion and additional Tk 4.41 lakh is levied for a 1500 cc Toyota Premio, according to the trade body leader. Additional levies for SUVs would range from Tk 21 lakh to Tk 55.37 lakh, he added. For up to 1800 cc microbuses, it proposed to increase duty from 23.55 percent to 101.53 percent and from 72.14 to 208.44 percent for those over 1800 cc. The new duty structure would cost an additional Tk 2.10 lakh for a 1800 cc Toyota DX/GL microbus; Tk 7.96 lakh for a 2000 cc Toyota Noah/Voxy microbus and Tk 1.31 lakh for a 2000 cc Toyota Hi Ace microbus, said the BARVIDA leader. Chowdhury suggested a simplified duty structure. He proposed 30 percent duty for up to 1500 cc, 45 percent from 1501 to 2000 cc, 60 percent from 2001 to 2500 cc, 100 percent from 2501 to 3000 cc and 250 percent for over 3001 cc. The trade body also called for a 20 percent dealer's commission deducted as before, imposing zero AVT on microbuses and daily use cars. bdnew
