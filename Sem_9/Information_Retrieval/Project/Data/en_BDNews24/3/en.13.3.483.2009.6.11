<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Jun 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President Barack Obama has sent a letter to the Indian government, the US special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan said on Wednesday without providing details on the contents. The envoy, Richard Holbrooke, told reporters that US Undersecretary of State William Burns was delivering the "presidential letter" while visiting New Delhi this week. Holbrooke, who visited Pakistan last week to assess relief efforts to help the estimated 2 million people who have fled a Pakistani offensive against the Taliban, declined to comment on the contents of the letter. US officials would like to see a reduction in tensions between India and Pakistan in part in the hopes that Islamabad can redeploy troops from its eastern border with India to fight the Taliban on its western border with Afghanistan
