 Dhaka, June 13 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh Betar went fully 'on air' in Comilla on Saturday, after running test programmes for an hour each day since May 15. "The present government believes in free flow of information," information minister Abul Kalam Azad said, launching the new station. "Every citizen has right to information." Highlighting the importance of radio, he said it had an important role in involving people with public development work. He called on the media to play a greater role in raising overall public awareness of issues involving health, education, environment and social welfare. As Azad was formally launching the station, local MPs Mujibul Haq and Nasimul Alam Chowdhury asked the minister for a local television broadcasting centre too. The minister requested that all the MPS in Comilla press for it together. Mohammad Mahbubul Alam, director general of Bangladesh Betar, presided over the launch of the station at Bangladesh Betar Bhaban in Comilla. bdn
