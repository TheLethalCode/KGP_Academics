 Rohan Ziad bdnews24.com business correspondent Dhaka, June 15 (bdnews24.com)Supply of quality shares, including those of state-owned enterprises, is more important for the capital market than raising liquidity by allowing 'black money' in, say analysts. They say the option to pour in previously undisclosed funds would lure many to invest in shares but will not yield any long-term benefit, and may instead lead to overheating of the market. After repeated demands from many quarters, including the stock market, finance minister AMA Muhith's, presenting his maiden budget last week, extended the facility for 'whitening black money' for an unprecedented three years. Muhith offers the opportunity to legalise undisclosed money "with no questions asked", with a 10 percent tax levied and provided the money is invested in the capital market, industry and infrastructure. The budget has not cut the rate of corporate tax, however, despite calls from stock market players. SEC advisory committee member Abu Ahmed said that the offer to invest undisclosed money might perk up the market. "But, there is a possibility of 'black money' holders keeping back their funds right now and instead investing only during the last phase of the three-year period," he told bdnews24.com. The consequence would be a loss in revenue for the government, said Ahmed, a professor of economics at the University of Dhaka. Meanwhile, increased liquidity in the stock market will not contribute that much to the country's industrialisation process. "Some shareholders may be benefited if the secondary market sees a boost but it will not foster industry," said Zaid Bakht, an economic analyst at Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies. "The decision to cut duty on raw materials for local industry, on the other hand will very beneficial," added Bakht, who is a member of the SEC's advisory committee. Stockbrokers fear that inflow of huge funds without supply of new issues might lead to overpricing of issues. "Once black money starts to pour in, demand will shoot up for sharesbad news in a shallow market like ours," said investment consultant Bashir Ahmed of brokerage firm Stocks & Bonds. Salahuddin Ahmed Khan, a former CEO of Dhaka Stock Exchange agrees. "The issue for the Bangladeshi capital market is not lack of liquidity but the supply of shares." "The option to invest black money may perk up the marketbut what the market now needs is supply of fresh and quality scrips." Ahmed, who now teaches finance at the University of Dhaka, suggested measures to more private as well as government entities to be listed. The finance minister, in his budget speech, said the country's capital market witnessed a significant rise following offloading of SOEs. But Muhith said the coming year might not see the same. "I would like to mention that in the next fiscal year it may not be possible to disinvest any SOE considering the uncertain environment," said Muhith.
