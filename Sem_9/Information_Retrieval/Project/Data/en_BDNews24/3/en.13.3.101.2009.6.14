<TITLE> Iran situation `not good news' : French official </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PARIS, Sun Jun 14, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The situation in Iran is extremely worrying and has set back hopes of better relations with Tehran, French officials said on Sunday. "What is happening in Iran is clearly not good news for anyone, neither for the Iranians nor for peace and stability in the world," said Henri Guaino, one of French President Nicolas Sarkozy's closest advisors. Protesters have clashed with police in Tehran for two days running after Iranian authorities declared hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad outright winner in a contested presidential ballot.

Kouchner said the election campaign had raised hopes that there would be an open debate within Iran over its future direction and added that "civil Iranian society" clearly wanted such a dialogue. "France regrets that instead of openness there has been quite a brutal response... This will leave its mark, and the opposition will organise itself." Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has told all Iranians to rally behind Ahmadinejad, but opponents have denounced the vote as a fraud. Asked if he thought the election was rigged, Kouchner said: "Let's not throw any oil on the f
