 Dhaka, June 12 (bdnews24.com)Agriculture minister Motia Chowdhury has said National Service and Returning Home programmes proposed in the budget will not be politicised. Awami League had initiated Returning Home programme in its previous term in power, she told reporters at a post-budget press briefing at National Economic Council on Friday. Slum dwellers behind Sonargaon Hotel were sent back home for Tk 5,000 each. The government that time had not profiled them on their political affiliation, Motia said Tk 20 crore has been allocated in the proposed budget for professional and creative training programmes for the youth with higher secondary or equivalent qualification as a part of employment generation. The National Service project would be trialed in Barguna and Kurigram, she said. Tk 92 crore allocation has been proposed in the budget for Returning Home programme to train and employ slum dwellers in different professions after sending them back home, Motia added. Subsidy on fertiliser has been cut to Tk 3,600 crore from Tk 5,785 crore in the outgoing fiscal year. "Just on assuming office, Awami League government granted 50 percent subsidy on fertiliser, which no government did in the past," the minister added
