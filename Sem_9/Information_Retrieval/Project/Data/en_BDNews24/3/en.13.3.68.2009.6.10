 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, June 09 (bdnews24.com)The new Bangladeshi high commissioner to the UK has said one of his main tasks will be to help the government get documentary evidence on 1971 war crimes from the British authorities. "Britain provided all possible assistance for Bangladesh's independence in 1971," Sayeedur Rahman Khan, who joins his new office on Wednesday, told bdnews24.com in an interview. "So we expect they will provide us with the available evidence on war crimes committed by the anti-liberation forces for fair and transparent trial to which the government is committed," he said. Foreign minister Dipu Moni during a trip to London in May talked to her British counterpart David Miliband and sought documentary support from his country. "As a nation we are grateful not only to the British government but also to its people and media for their active support during our war of independence in 1971," said Khan. "In fact, London became the centre of overseas activities supporting our struggle for independence." "So, I feel extremely happy to go to London to represent Bangladesh as high commissioner," he said. Many British newspapers and television channels captured killings of civilians, by the Pakistan army and its local collaborators in 1971, on film and footage. Khan, a former vice chancellor of Rajshahi University, spoke of his challenges as high commissioner since he had little prior experience in diplomacy. "I am a teacher and I spent about 40 years in teaching and research. In that context this is a new avenue in my career." "But I believe, if one is committed, sincere and honest in his or her duties, to a cause, he or she must succeed," he said. "I have been studying and trying to learn the details of the diplomatic activities which I shall have to undertake." "The bilateral relations between the UK and Bangladesh are excellent, and I will definitely try to strengthen that relationship even further," said Khan. He said he would work to guarantee uninterrupted flow of aid flow to Bangladesh. "The UK is the largest bilateral donor to Bangladesh for development in many sectors. "The ongoing global economic recession has hit Britain and other partners. But I am sure Bangladesh will not be deprived of getting development assistance from Britain," he said. "I will try my best to convince the British government to continue the assistance they normally provide." The professor said he would also look after the interests of Bangladesh exporters. "I will try to see that export of Bangladeshi goods to the UK to remains unaffected." Khan said he would try to solve the problems of the huge number of British Bangladeshis working in the UK curry industry. He said the proposed catering institute in Sylhet should start functioning immediately. "I will also see that the industry is not affected due to the shortage of skilled or semi-skilled workers in the sector." "Many other such institutes can be established in the country in order to meet the need for skilled human resources in the curry industry. "Such institutes will also help curry restaurant workers learncommunicate with customersin the UK". "Of course I will give a patient hearing to all the problems facing the British Bangladeshi community in the UK and try to play my part to resolve them gradually," he said.
