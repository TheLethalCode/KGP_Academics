<TEXT>
 MADRID, June 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - David Villa scored a sparkling hat-trick as Spain strolled to a 6-0 win over Azerbaijan in a friendly in Baku on Tuesday. The European champions, playing their final match before this month's Confederations Cup in South Africa, dominated early possession and took a deserved lead in the 34th minute. Alvaro Arbeloa galloped down the right and Villa, who earlier hit the post, smashed the Liverpool defender's low cross high into net from the edge of the box. The Valencia striker's second came five minutes later when he unleashed a left-foot shot from just outside the penalty area that had too much pace for Azerbaijan goalkeeper Farhad Veliyev. Cesc Fabregas sustained a nasty head wound in winning a penalty shortly before halftime and Villa slotted home from the spot for his 28th international goal in 44 matches. Albert Riera, substitute Daniel Guiza and Fernando Torres struck in the second half to complete the rout and the win stretched Spain's unbeaten run to 32 matches going back to a 1-0 defeat to Romania in Cadiz in November 2006. It was their 12th straight victory since a 0-0 draw in the Euro 2008 quarter-final against Italy in June last year. Villa's three strikes lifted him above Emilio Butragueno and Fernando Morientes into third in the list of Spain's top scorers. He is now one behind Fernando Hierro and 16 short of top marksman Raul who netted 44 times
