In most cases, they interfere in the routine transactions in flagrant breach of the rules and regulations prescribed by Bangladesh Bank. The central bank sent a circular to the banks cautioning them against the irregularities The circular signed by the general manager of Banking Regulatory and Policy Department, Abu Hena Mohammed Razi Hasan, said that BRPD on July 2003 had issued a circular on responsibilities and accountability of board of directors and managing directors. The 2003 circular had said that they were assigned to perform distinct roles in loan and risk management, internal control, human resource management and development, income and expenditure, and other non-financial activities. But Tuesday's circular stated that a recent study found that chairman of the board of directors, board of directors and managing directors were interfering in the day-to-day banking activities including loan sanction process and were taking part in administrative tasks beyond their responsibilities. It also alleged that some bank directors were using the transports, telephones and rooms of the banks for personal comfort and even recruiting employees and officials in violation of regulation. The irregularities are alarming and a bar to good governance, it said The circular asked the banks to follow the rules and regulations stipulated in the previous circular. bd
