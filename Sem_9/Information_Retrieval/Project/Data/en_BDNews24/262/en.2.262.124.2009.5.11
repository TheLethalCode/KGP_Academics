 Kuala Lampur, May 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The leader of a banned ethnic Indian protest group said on Monday he would return to Malaysia from self-imposed exile in Britain after the release of three of his colleagues from detention without trial. Malaysia released the last members of the Hindu Rights Action Force (Hindraf) on Friday. They were held under the Internal Security Act (ISA), a measure that allows indefinite detention on national security grounds. "Now that my comrades have been released, I have decided that I shall return to Malaysia to continue and forge ahead with the objectives and goals of Hindraf in seeking what it had originally set out to, even at the risk of me being arrested under ISA or any other repressive laws," the group's chairman Waytha Moorthy said in a statement. Hindraf shot to fame in 2007 when it organised mass protests by the country's ethnic Indian community, who account for seven percent of the country's 27 million population and who are among the most economically deprived. Although a small grouping, Indian voters turned against the National Front coalition in national and state elections in 2008 when the government that has ruled this Southeast Asian country for 51 years stumbled to its worst losses. The Malaysian Indian Congress, which represents ethnic Indians and is a member of the coalition, was almost wiped out as a parliamentary force in the elections and is now seeking to woo Hindraf into its fold. The Hindraf detainees' release allows Malaysia to say it no longer has any political prisoners held under the ISA. Political analysts say the releases were window-dressing following dozens of arrests last week in the state of Perak.
