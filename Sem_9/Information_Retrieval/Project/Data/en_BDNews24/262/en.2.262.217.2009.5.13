<TITLE> Toilet snake attack: urban legend comes true? </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Taipei, May 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Taiwanese man became a sitting target for a snake, which bit his penis as sat on the toilet at his rural home, local media reported on Monday. "As soon as he sat down, he suddenly felt a knife-like pain and reacted instinctively by standing up," the China Times said. "When he looked down, he saw the big snake." The 51-year-old man, from Nantou County, was under medical care with minor injuries, a director at Puli Christian Hospital said. "As soon as he has passed the risk of infection, he can go," the director, who declined to be named, said. "A snake's mouth isn't always clean." Local television images showed the black and yellow reptile, reportedly a species of rat snake, being uncoiled and plucked slowly from the toilet bowl. Snakes regularly enter rural homes in Taiwan and other sub-tropical regions of Asia.
