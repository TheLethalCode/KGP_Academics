 New Delhi, May 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The following is a snapshot of recent developments in India's general election campaign. (The sources are mentioned in brackets). H.D. Kumaraswamy, former chief minister of Karnataka, and leader of the Janata Dal (Secular), met Sonia Gandhi, the Congress party chief at her residence late on Tuesday. After the meeting, Kumaraswamy whose party is a member of the Third Front, said he met Gandhi to discuss alliances in Karnataka. But the media speculated that the meeting was more about building an alliance and Kumaraswamy had his face covered as he entered Gandhi's house. (Mail Today) The Third Front, a coalition of smaller political parties, promising to form the next government, appears to be crumbling with senior leaders warming up to opposition parties. Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the main opposition in the country, is going all out to woo parties that are prepared to support Lal Krishna Advani for the prime minister's post, Venkaiah Naidu, a senior leader said. The BJP is in touch with the several parties in southern India as well as Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state to build post-election alliances. (The Times of India) The BJP has gained some momentum in the last few days in the race to build alliances over the Congress party, but cobbling a viable coalition remains difficult given the growing strength of smaller parties. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said the government was ready to discuss relief measures for flood victims in Bihar in what is seen as an attempt to reach out to the powerful ruling group there. Prime Minister Singh, spoke to Nitish Kumar, chief minister of Bihar over telephone late on Tuesday, a day after he criticised Kumar, for not utilising central funds for flood victims. (Indian Express, The Times of India) The Congress party, which has struggled to keep its allies together, is reaching out to regional parties to cobble together an alliance to regain power at the centre. WHAT THE NEWSPAPERS SAY The outcome of the last phase of the election process depends on a number of women candidates and women voters in several states going to polls. "The outcome of this endgame is linked to women. It so happens that three of the big states - Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh - have a major women leader at the heart of the electoral battle - Jayalalithaa, Mayawati and Mamata Banerjee," analyst Yogendra Yadav in The Hindu newspaper.
