 MOSCOW, Wed May 13, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia will charge US astronauts $51 million per return trip to the International Space Station (ISS) from 2012 and will resume selling seats to space tourists, Russian news agencies reported on Wednesday. NASA needs to use the Russian Soyuz capsule because its own Space Shuttle will be retired next year after nearly 3 decades in service and a replacement is not due until 2014 at the earliest.

He said the tourist would not be the last. "This form of tourism will continue," Perminov was quoted by Itar-Tass as saying. NASA and all other partners will be solely dependent on Russia for crew transport after the shuttle ceases operations. NASA plans to replace the shuttles with Apollo-style capsules that in addition to traveling to the space station will be able to fly astronauts to the moon's sur
