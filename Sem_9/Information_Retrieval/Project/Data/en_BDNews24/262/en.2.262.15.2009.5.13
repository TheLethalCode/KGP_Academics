 Dhaka, May 13 (bdnews24.com)The telecoms regulator was made to look like the police by the 2007-2008 military-installed emergency government, the chairman of Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission said on Wednesday. Many things had happened been to many sectors otherwise impossible in a democratic environment, Zia Ahmed said at a press conference at the telecoms watchdog's office in the capital. A democratic government makes decision in line with law, he said. The press conference was organised to mark the World Telecommunication and Information Society Day, to be observed on May 17. On hefty fines on rogue telecoms operators caught running clandestine VoIP operations during the Fakhruddin Ahmed-led caretaker government, the chairman said many of them alleged that they were forced to pay the fines. He had raised the same allegations in another press conference at the telecommunication ministry a few days back. A maximum of Tk 3 lakh can be realised under existing rules, he had pointed out Asked if he would investigate the allegations, Ahmed replied, "If the government wants to." "No organisation in Bangladesh is free. Each of them has to be accountable to the governmentHowever, we are enjoying great freedom." Questioned whether the realisation of fine under law was unjustified, the former army officer said the caretaker government had a different outlook. "The present government's position is different. I think whatever needs to be done should be done in line with law." "As a regulator, our fist duty is to expand the information technology sector, reach it to the people and streamline the sector." "The next task is policing." He said the drive against the illegal VoIP continued. The BTRC realised Tk 838 crore in fines from GrameenPhone, Banglalink, AKTEL and CityCell for illegal VOIP business. GrameenPhone paid Tk. 168 crore and Tk 250 crore, CityCell Tk 150 crore, AKTEL Tk 145 crore and Banglalink Tk 125 crore. Private land-phone company RanksTel was also fined Tk 15 crore. bdn
