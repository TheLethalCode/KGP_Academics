 Dhaka May 14 (bdnews24.com)The government will form a separate pay commission for teachers to restore their dignity, education minister Nurul Islam Nahid said on Thursday. "We want to restore dignity of the teachers. For that we want to form separate pay commission and recruitment board for them," Nahid said as he launched a project at Sheraton Hotel in the capital. "We have already started work to this end," he said, and added the teachers should work with dedication. The University Grants Commission initiated the World Bank-funded project for developing qualitative standard of higher studies. The minister said they would provide stipends for the disadvantaged students in tea gardens and hill tracts to prevent drop-outs. At present 40 percent students are provided stipends, he said. Nahid said the government had taken steps to purge the academic institutions of partisanship. UGC chairman Nazrul Islam said about the project that it aimed to develop academic and research activities in the higher studies. The project is designed to contribute to generating eligible and qualified human resources.
