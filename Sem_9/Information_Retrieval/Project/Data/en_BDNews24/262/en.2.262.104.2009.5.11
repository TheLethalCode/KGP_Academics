 NEW DELHI, Mon May 11, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's economy grew an estimated 6.5 percent in the just-ended 2008/09 fiscal year and consumer price inflation is expected to moderate in five to six months, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said on Monday. A global economic slump and slowdown in domestic demand have weakened economic growth in Asia's third largest economy, but falls in commodity prices have helped moderate prices. "The wholesale price inflation is already down to around 1 percent and there is a time lag for the consumer price inflation to also fall," Singh told a news conference at Ludhiana. "But I am sure CPI inflation will moderate in five to six months," he said at the last lap of a month-long election campaign in Punjab. India's wholesale price index rose 0.70 percent in the 12 months to April 25, above the previous week's annual rise of 0.57 percent. But annual CPI inflation stood at 9.63 percent in February, as prices of food products remained firm. Singh said the government estimated Asia's third-largest economy grew 6.5 percent the 2008/09 financial year, which ended on March 31. That would be well below 2007/08's 9 percent and the slowest since growth of 3.8 percent in 2002/03, but Singh said it was still the second-highest growth rate among major economies. The Reserve Bank of India has forecast growth to further slow to 6 percent in 2009/10. Private analysts have also scaled down growth forecasts for 2008/09 and 2009/10 after dismal export and factory output data. The government will release GDP data for 2008/09 on Ma
