 Dhaka, May 13 (bdnews24.com) Foreign minister Dipu Moni leaves on Thursday for Myanmar to ask her counterpart not to mobilise troops along the border to implement a recent decision to fence the frontier, a top foreign ministry official says. Myanmar on Mar 15 brought fencing equipment and put troops on standby along Bangladesh border to raise barbed-wire fence just across Naaf river in Cox's Bazar district without informing Dhaka. Foreign secretary Md Touhid Hossain said on Wednesday the foreign minister will discuss with Myanmar officials all bilateral issues such as maritime disputes and construction of the proposed cross-country highway to boost up trade. The foreign minister and her three aides will have talks with her Myanmar counterpart and other government officials on May 16 and 17 in Naypyidaw, the former Burma's new capital. This will be Dipu Moni's first visit to a reclusive country since she took office on Jan. 6 this year. Hossain said Dipu Moni would also raise the issue of implementing Bangladesh-Myanmar hydro-electric project in Myanmar to ensure cooperation in the energy sector. The two neighbours have been in discussion for implementing three hydro-electricity power projects with capacity of 1000 mega watts in Rakhain state for over 30 years. "There are reports of problems over the border management. "We will insist Myanmar not mobilise troops along the border to maintain peaceful atmosphere there," Hossain told bdnews24.com. Bangladesh mainly through media came to know about Myanmar's fencing activities, prompting Dhaka to keep its border troops on high alert. Myanmar has been trying to fence from Maungdaw township to Paletwa township, one home ministry official told bdnews24.com. "Of course, we will discuss disputes over maritime boundary delimitation in the Bay," the foreign secretary said. He said the two technical teams had been holding talks to settle down disputes over claim and counter-claim of waters in the Bay of Bengal. Myanmar in Dec 16 submitted a report to the United Nations claiming huge areas of Bangladesh's waters in the Bay of Bengal. The foreign secretary said they were at the final stages of preparing a protest letter over Myanmar's claim. Myanmar had sent navy ships to the disputed waters to assist South Korean construction giant Hyundai to set up rigs there despite Bangladesh's strong protest. The diplomatic standoff came to an end after Hyundai wound up its operation at Bangladesh's request.
