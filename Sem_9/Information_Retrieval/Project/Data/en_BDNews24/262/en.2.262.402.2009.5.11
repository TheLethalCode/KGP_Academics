 Prakash Biswas bdnews24.com court correspondent Dhaka May 11 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court on Monday served summons on former Jamaat-e-Islami chief Golam Azam, incumbent chief Matiur Rahman Nizami, secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammed Mojaheed, BNP leader Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury and 32 others to appear in court on July 20. Dhaka ninth additional district judge Iftekhar Ahmed issued the summons at 11:30am over a civil suit filed last year seeking court orders declaring them 'war criminals' and barring them from running elections. The 36 are to explain why they should not be declared "war criminals" for the crimes they had committed during Bangladesh's war of independence from Pakistan in 1971. . Chowdhury is the parliamentary affairs adviser to opposition BNP chief Khaleda Zia. Advocates Liton Mia, Safayet Hossain Sajib and Rajib Ahmed filed the petition with Dhaka District Judge's Court on Nov 13, 2008, a month before the general elections. . The chief election commissioner, Election Commission secretary and Dhaka deputy commissioner were also made defendants in the case. The court on Monday held a hearing on whether the case should be pursued before taking it into cognisance. It also set July 20 as the next date for returning the summons, defence counsel Syed Ahmad Mostafa Rana told bdnews24.com. The litigants in the petition said the 36 were 'war criminals' according to International Crimes (Tribunals) Act 1973, the relevant law on 1949 Geneva Convention and the Representation of People Order (Amendment) 2008. They said the 36 were identified as war criminals after the war though they were yet to be brought to justice. Azam, Nizami, Mojahid were among those who had formed militia outfits such Al Badr, Al Shams and Rajakar, and aided and abetted the Pakistan army in the killing of around 30 lakh people and rape of nearly 3 lakh women, the suit said.
