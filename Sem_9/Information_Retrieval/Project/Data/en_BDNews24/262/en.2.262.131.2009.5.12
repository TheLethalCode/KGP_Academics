 Reazul Bashar bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, May 12 (bdnews24.com)The government can set up an exclusive, high-tech industrial zone for 500 handicrafts entrepreneurs to wring more foreign currencies from exports, the industry spokesman says. "International buyers are not coming to our country as handicrafts manufacturers are not concentrated in particular places," Bangladesh Handicrafts Manufacturers and Exporters Association (Bangla Craft) president Golam Ahsan says. Handicrafts worth $ 5.9 million were exported during July to March of the current fiscal year, around 23 percent from the same period of the last year and over 16 percent from the export target. Bangladesh fetched nearly $5.5 million during 2007-08 fiscal year from handicrafts exports mainly to EU countries. The handicrafts include cane furniture, home textile, earthen ornaments, clothes made by the indigenous people and earthen tiles. On the prospects of handicrafts, Ahsan says, "The German import handicrafts worth around 750 million dollar every year while Vietnam exports ten times more than we do." "It is not possible for an entrepreneur to avail themselves of modern technology but all entrepreneurs can be benefited if an industrial zone equipped with latest technology is established," Ahsan observes. He led a delegation to a meeting with industries minister Dilip Barua on Monday to get the industry a shot in the arm. The minister said the government will suggest single-digit bank interest rate for handicrafts sector. The handicrafts industries need not any raw materials from abroad which are costly and take time, he added. The former president of Bangla Craft, Ashrafur Rahman, tells bdnews24.com that 450 enlisted entrepreneurs employ nearly two lakh people. b
