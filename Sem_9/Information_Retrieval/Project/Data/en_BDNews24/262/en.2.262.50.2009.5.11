 Amit Talukdar bdnews24.com Legal Affairs Correspondent Dhaka , May 11 (bdnews24.com)The chief justice on Monday referred the petition of Khaleda Zia to a fifth bench of the High Court after yet another bench declined to hear the appeal against an executive order asking the opposition leader to vacate the cantonment house. The bench of justices Syed Rifat Ahmed and Mainul Islam Chowdhury will hear the petition on Tuesday morning Earlier in the day, a fourth bench of justices Md Anwarul Haque and Farah Mahbub said it was unable to hear the appeal because a judge of the two-strong bench had given his views on the house as a law ministry joint secretary. They referred the case to the chief justice for further orders. Chief justice M M Ruhul Amin had constituted the bench on Sunday after a third bench felt embarrassed to hear the petition. At the start of the hearing, when Khaleda's lawyer TH Khan, himself a former HC judge, appealed for more time, Md Anwarul Haque, the senior judge of the bench, since he had given his views, he would not be able to hear any petition on the matter. He cited the code of conduct for the judges to express his inability. But the bench did not feel "embarrassed". Khan said the bench was obligated to hear the petition according to the oath of office of the judges. "But you are breaching the oath." Justice Haque showed him the code of conduct. "A judge will be unable to hear any petition if s/he gave opinion on the matter earlier," he said. "As I had given my opinion on the matter earlier I am not able to hear the petition," Justice Haque said. Another counsel for Khaleda, Moudud Ahmed, said the court could examine the matter after hearing the petition. Additional attorney general MK Rahman and Murad Reza stood for the state. On Sunday, the bench of justices Jinat Ara and A K M Abdul Hakim felt embarrassed to hear the writ petition and sent the file to the chief justice. The former prime minister on Sunday night served a legal notice on the government to cancel the supplementary notice it had sent on May 7. Her lawyer Mahbubuddin Khokan sent the notice by courier service and registered post asking the government to withdraw the notice within five days. On May 3, the bench of justices Ara and Hakim had admitted the petition and adjourned the hearing until Sunday on the attorney general's assurance that the government would not move in a week to evict the former prime minister. Earlier, the bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Quamrul Islam Siddiqui had felt embarrassed to hear the petition that sought a stay on the government order. Another bench, made of justices Tariqul Hakim and M Azizul Haque that had permitted the lawyers for the opposition leader to submit an affidavit prior to filing the writ appeal also felt embarrassed. Military lands and cantonments directorate served Khaleda the notice on April 20 asking her to vacate her cantonment house. In a modified notice on May 7, it asked the opposition BNP chief to leave the house within 15 days. The cabinet on April 8 cancelled the lease on the house on grounds that the leasing process had been faulty and that she violated lease terms. Khaleda responded to the government's first notice with a legal notice of her own on Apr 23. After murder of her husband, army chief-turned-president Ziaur Rahman on May 30, 1981 during a military mutiny, his widow, Khaleda, was given another house in Gulshan in addition to the house in the cantonment the family had been living since the 1970s. The 2.72-acre mansion was originally the official home of the army chief, a position held by then Lt Gen Zia who then converted himself into a civilian head of state through martial law proclamations and controversial votes. Before the cabinet took the decision to cancel the lease, prime minister Sheikh Hasina said in parliament that she would ask the slain general's wife to vacate the house and that blocks of apartments would be built in the prime land for families of army officers killed in the Feb mutiny
