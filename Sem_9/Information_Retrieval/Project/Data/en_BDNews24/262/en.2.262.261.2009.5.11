 Dhaka, May 11 (bdnews24.com)Police have sued some 500 unnamed students of North South University on charges of vandalism on attack on the law-enforcers who after the students on Sunday demonstrated against the authorities' decision to hike credit fees. Gulshan police sub-inspector Helal filed the case on Sunday night, another sub-inspector Mahmud Hasan said. Additional contingent of police has been deployed on the university's Banani campus to thwart a flare-up of violence following news that three demonstrators had been arrested on the campus on Monday morning, Gulshan zone deputy police commissioner Hafiz Akter said. He said police arrested anyone on the campus. The private university declared the campus closed for Monday and Tuesday but the students said they would stage more demonstrations against the arrests, fee hike and police attack. Hundreds of protesters vandalised the administrative building, prompting police to fire tear-gas canisters to disperse the demonstrators, who retaliated by hurling stones. Police then charged baton on the students who blocked the streets on the campus and confined teachers inside the building. Gulshan zone deputy police commissioner Hafiz Akter said three policemen were injured in the clashes. The authorities hiked each credit fee to Tk 5,500 from Tk 4,000, said Ashfaq Alam, a student of the last semester. University's public relations officer Masudur Rahman on Sunday had said the credit fee for the existing students was hiked to Tk 4,500, while it would be Tk 5,500 for fresh admission-seekers. Rahman had said the university was yet to reach a decision on the demand of the students. Authorities had told students that they would not increase the fees when agitations had started in February. But the hike was announced this month, Alam, the student, said. Students, who came to pay fees in the morning, found the new notice and started demonstrations without depositing the money. The authorities then sought one and a half hours from the students to resolve the issue but failed, prompting the students to pour out onto the streets. bdn
