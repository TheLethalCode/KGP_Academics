<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Wed May 13, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States said on Wednesday it was very concerned by video of a member of the ruling family of Abu Dhabi allegedly torturing an Afghan man, footage that could stall a civilian nuclear deal with the United Arab Emirates. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said the department was consulting with Congress about the agreement, which could be blocked if an outcry over the video grows. The deal could be worth billions of dollars to US energy companies that build and operate nuclear power plants. "We, of course, are very concerned by this video," Kelly told reporters when asked whether the 2004 torture video was holding up implementation of the agreement, which was signed in the final days of the former Bush administration and has to be sent to Congress for review by President Barack Obama. "We think it's an important agreement, but, as I said, we are right now in the stage of having consultations with Congress," Kelly said. "At the appropriate time, we'll make the decision," he told reporters. In part of the video, which has been shown on US television networks as well as at a congressional hearing on Wednesday, an Afghan man is shown being abused with an electric cattle prod, beaten with whips and a plank of wood with a nail on it and driven over by a car at a desert location in 2004. Kelly declined to draw a link between the video and possible stalling on the deal. But another US official, who declined to be named, confirmed the graphic footage was an issue. Some lawmakers also believe the UAE is not doing enough to curb Iran's atomic ambitions. They also want more transparency over the nuclear deal that establishes a legal framework for commerce in nuclear energy between the United States and UAE. NO TIMELINE FOR NUCLEAR DEAL A senior US official, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the issue is sensitive, said the video was "shocking" and that the Obama administration had discussed it with the UAE. "We have urged them to have a thorough and prompt review and to take appropriate follow-up action," said the official. The senior official refused to speculate on when Obama might sign off on it. "I will not comment on internal deliberations or speculate about timing," the official said. Abu Dhabi's judicial department said on Monday that prosecutors had detained Sheikh Issa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, a brother of the UAE crown prince, pending an outcome of an investigation into the video. The UAE is a federation of seven emirates, each run by a ruling family. The reported investigation is the first of a ruling family member of Abu Dhabi, the capital of the UAE. Lawmakers aired a 10-minute video at a Capitol Hill hearing on Wednesday showing three incidents of abuse involving the royal family member. One of the men in the video, whom the U.S. network ABC said last month was Sheikh Issa, is seen pouring what the network said was salt into the man's wounds. A man in police uniform takes part too. "In each case, Sheikh Issa is seen beating and terrorizing his victims -- and in each case, he is assisted by uniformed individuals, some of whom, especially in the group incident, appear to be official uniformed security or police members," Rep. James McGovern, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said in a statement at the hearing. McGovern wrote to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton last month urging her to hold off on the nuclear deal until the issue over the video was resolved. In his April 23 letter, McGovern urged a temporary hold on "further US expenditures of funds, training, sales or transfers of equipment or technology including nuclear until a full review" of the torture video. As a step toward implementing the deal, Obama has to issue a presidential determination over the agreement saying it is in the country's interests to proceed. Once Obama has signed the determination, Congress is then notified by Clinton and a 90-day review period begins after which the deal comes into force unless there are objections. McGovern, who urged any minors in the hearing room to leave before the video was shown, said it had been a hard decision to show the video publicly. "I cannot describe the horror and revulsion I felt when witnessing what is on this video," said McGovern at the hearing, which was called to look into abuses in the
