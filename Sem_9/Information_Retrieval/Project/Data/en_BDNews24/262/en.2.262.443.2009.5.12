 Dhaka, May 12 (bdnews24.com)A special court judge sent to BNP's Rashiduzzaman Millat, sentenced to 14 years in two cases, as the fugitive former MP appeared before him Tuesday. Judge Md Firoz Alam made the order after he turned himself in to the court at around 11am. The court on Jan 29 last year sentenced Millat eight years in jail for concealing wealth information. Another court on Nov 28, 2007 gave him six years for not paying taxes. Milliat had not been seen in public since the state of emergency was clamped on Jan 11, 2007. The judge ordered Millat, known to be a close aide of BNP senior joint secretary general Tarique Rahman, to jail as there is no jurisdiction to grant bail for a convict in the concealing wealth information case. On May 3, the High Court ordered the fugitive VIP convicts to surrender before trial court within two weeks. Millat was sent to jail under supervision of assistant commissioner of police prosecution department. He will be enjoying medical and division facilities in line with jail code. The same court sentenced him to eight years in jail and fined him Tk 10 lakh on charges of accumulating and concealing information about assets. He will have to serve another year in failure to pay the fine. On Nov 28, 2007 the former MP from Jamalpur was sentenced to six years in jail on charges of evading tax in a case filed by the National Board of Revenue. The court also sentenced Millat's wife Sabera Suraiya and their son Sayeed Bin Jamal to three years each in jail for assisting him in amassing wealth. It fined the two Tk 1 lakh each and they will have to serve one more month in prison in the event of non-payment. The two accused are on the run. bdnews24.co
