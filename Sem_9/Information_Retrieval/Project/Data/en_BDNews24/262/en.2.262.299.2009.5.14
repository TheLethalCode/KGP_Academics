 LONDON, May 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Carlos Tevez produced a stunning equaliser before Michael Carrick's late strike earned Manchester United a 2-1 victory at Wigan Athletic on Wednesday to move within one point of a third consecutive Premier League title. United trailed to Hugo Rodallega's first-half goal but the visitors surged back after the interval and now need a draw at home to Arsenal on Saturday to wrap up a record-equalling 18th crown. The champions, who have won seven league matches in a row, have 86 points to second-placed Liverpool's 80 with two games remaining. Tevez, who was quoted in Sunday's newspapers as saying he wanted to leave the club, came off the bench in the second half and produced a piece of magic after 62 minutes that left the 5,000 United fans in the stadium singing his name.

Rooney blazed another effort over the bar while Rodallega almost made it 2-0 before halftime. United were much better after the break especially after Tevez replaced Anderson in the 58th minute. The Argentine had only been on the pitch four minutes when he flicked an off-target Carrick shot through his own legs with his back to goal, directing the ball beyond Wigan keeper Richard Kingson in a flash. It was the signal for a United onslaught. Ronaldo fired one effort high over the bar but was involved in the winner when his low cross arrived at Carrick's feet and the midfielder sent an unstoppable shot past Kingson. "We just had to keep patient," said Ferguson, now on the verge of an 11th title with United. "It was a great second goal by Carrick and a really gutsy performance by
