 Dhaka, May 11 (bdnews24.com)At least 50 people were injured and 25 vehicles damaged when the workers of a readymade garment factory at Savar went on the rampage on Monday over pay held up for three months. The officer-in-charge of Savar Police Station, Nasirullah, told bdnews24.com that the garment workers put barricade on busy Dhaka-Aricha highway from around 2:45pm to 4pm, causing long traffic gridlock. The demonstrators vandalised 25-30 vehicles and set fire to a police pick-up. Police charged baton, fire rubber bullets and hurled tear-gas canisters at the protesters to bring the situation under control, Nasirullah said Some 50 workers were injured during the clash. A worker with bullet injury was admitted in a nearby clinic, the police officer added The workers of Doel Group started agitation inside the factory at around 2:30pm demanding three months' arrears and later blocked the highway.
