<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 12 (bdnews24.com)State minister for home Tanjim Ahmed says the government will not compromise in curbing terrorism and militancy. Militancy may be under control but that did not mean the country was free of the menace, he told reporters after the first meeting of a national motivation committee, formed on Apr 22, at the Secretariat. "We're announcing zero-tolerance [towards militancy]." Bangladesh will be purged of militancy through awareness campaign, Tanjim said. He said militancy is not a problem of madrasas alone; there could be members of militant groups at schools, colleges and universities as well. The government has formed the high-level 17-member 'motivation committee' to beef up intelligence surveillance and raise public awareness in tackling militancy. It includes secretaries from the prime minister's office, home, education, law, religion, social affairs, information and local government ministries. Other members of the committee include the chiefs of police, DGFI, NSI, BDR, RAB ansar and VDP. The junior minister said the committee took up a number of short and long-term steps that include directing the ministries of education, religious affairs, information and social welfare to launch a mass awareness programme. The committee also directed the local government ministry and security agencies to mount watch. bdnews24.c
