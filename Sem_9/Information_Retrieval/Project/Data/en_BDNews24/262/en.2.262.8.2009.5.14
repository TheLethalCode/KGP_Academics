 Barisal, May 14 (bdnews24.com)Barisal city police have banned public gathering in Barisal Club and Barisal Zilla School, the venues earmarked for rallying on Thursday by Bangladesh Madrasa Teachers' Council. BMTC is a opposition Jama'at-e-Islami-backed body which invited alleged war criminal and Jamaat leader Maulana Delwar Hossain Sayeedi to the meeting as chief guest. Police feared that the rally might cause security problems. Barisal Metropolitan Police commissioner Md Abdur Rahim enforced section 144, barring people from assembling at the venues. Maulana Motiur Rahman, member-secretary, BMTC's Barisal chapter had written to the local police chief on May 9 seeking permission to hold the rally. The list of guests to arrive attached with the application did not mention the name of Sayeedi though. Police, however, disbanded the rally before the BMTC organisers could begin rallying at the venues with Maulana Delwar Hossain Sayeedi as the chief guest. bdnews
