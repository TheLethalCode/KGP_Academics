 Dhaka, May 12 (bdnews24.com)The government decided on Tuesday to buy 420 Mitsubishi Pajero jeeps for as many Upazila chairmen. The decision came from a meeting, chaired by finance minister AMA Muhith, of the ministry's committee on public purchases. Those Upazila that have cars very old, useless or out of order will get new Jeeps, cabinet secretary Abdul Aziz told reporters. Each 2350cc Jeep will cost Tk 32.2 lakh and Tk 8 lakh will be spent on registration of each vehicle. The cars will be bought directly from the state agency 'Pragati Industries Ltd', Aziz said. Sources close to the Cabinet Division said early on April 1 that government's transport directorate invited tender for purchasing 471 Jeeps for as many Upazila chairmen. The committee at its Tuesday's meeting went for the bidder that quoted the lowest price to supply the vehicles. The cabinet secretary, however, said the cars will not be bought in one go, only 180 cars will be bought in the 2008-09 fiscal year ending on June 30. The remainder will be bought with funds allotted in the 2009-10 budget at the same price, he added. The government had braced for cost savings at the ministries and divisions to deal with the aftermaths of te global economic recession. Asked if it was necessary to purchase cars under the circumstances, Muhith said the were giving them the cars who can easily serve their electorate. The elections to the local government body were held on Jan 22 and 471 of the 481 Upazila chairmen have taken oath since. bd
