 CANNES, France, Wed May 13, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Animated comedy adventure "Up" lifted the mood at the start of the Cannes film festival as cinema's biggest and glitziest gathering prepared to unroll the red carpet on Wednesday. The 10th feature by Disney's Pixar studios was warmly clapped at its press screening, where journalists donned special goggles for its 3D effects and it should get a similar welcome at the formal ceremony that opens the festival in the evening. The 62nd edition of the festival is expected to feature fewer of the celebrity driven events that are its hallmark as studios cut budgets in the recession but the glamour of Cannes remains a powerful magnet for the industry. "The thing I'm looking forward to most is seeing all those people in their tuxedos and gowns looking at this movie in their 3D glasses," "Up" producer and Pixar co-founder John Lasseter joked at a news conference. The tale of a retired curmudgeon and a zealous boy scout who float off to South America in a house borne aloft by a colored balloons, "Up" looks back to an earlier era when filmmakers like Frank Capra cheered audiences with a mix of humor and emotion. "We were trying to evoke a lot of those films from the '40s and '50s," said director Pete Docter, whose earlier films include the Oscar-nominated "Monsters Inc." As such it provided some light relief at a festival where much early talk has focused on cancellations and cutbacks and where the main competition was dubbed by trade paper Variety the "biggest heavyweight auteur smackdown in recent years." GLAMOUR The competition includes a string of familiar faces from previous Cannes festivals, including several past winners of the coveted Palme d'Or award from Quentin Tarantino to Ken Loach and New Zealand's Jane Campion. Tarantino is back with his World War Two movie "Inglourious Basterds," starring Brad Pitt and has attracted much of the early media buzz. But there are plenty of other stars including Penelope Cruz who stars in Pedro Almodovar's "Broken Embraces" or former France and Manchester United soccer star Eric Cantona who appears as himself in Loach's "Looking for Eric." Campion brings "Bright Star" based on the romance between 19th century poet John Keats and Fanny Brawne, while Lars von Trier is presenting the horror movie "Antichrist." Other highlights include Ang Lee's "Taking Woodstock" about the rock festival and Lou Ye's "Spring Fever," made in defiance of a five-year ban from film making imposed by China for his previous movie "Summer Palace," also in Cannes. Out of competition, Terry Gilliam has perhaps the biggest movie in Cannes. "The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus" is the late Australian actor Heath Ledger's final screen role, which had to be completed by Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell and Jude Law. Hundreds more movies are shown outside the main competition, many of them on the market which runs throughout the festival and reinforces Cannes' importance in the world of cinema. The deal making will go on, as will the parties, but market players expect the mood to be more subdued than in recent y
