 KARACHI, Pakistan, May 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has recruited a psychologist to help strengthen the team's mental resolve at next month's Twenty20 World Cup in England. Pakistan coach Intikhab Alam told Reuters that Dr Maqbool Babri would be working with the players at a conditioning camp in the hill resort of Bhurban from Thursday. "He will hold one-to-one sessions with the players and also conduct group therapy," Alam said on Tuesday. "The World Cup is an important event for us. People have lot of expectations from us and the team must do well." The former test captain said that during the recent one-day series against Australia in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, he noticed players were often guilty of making poor shot selections when they came under pressure. "I think sometimes it is the fear of failing that makes a sportsman crack under pressure. The idea is to improve the self-belief in our players so they can perform to their optimum abilities," he said. The week-long camp is being held at a higher altitude to also improve the squad's endurance and stamina levels. Alam said Pakistan had been short of matches against top opponents since last year and the World Cup would be a big test. "The players need to be ready to cope with the pressure and expectations," he added, noting that a majority of leading sportsmen employed sports psychologists on a permanent basis. Pakistan are in Group B of the 12-team tournament and open their campaign against hosts England on June 7. The Netherlands are the other team in the group
