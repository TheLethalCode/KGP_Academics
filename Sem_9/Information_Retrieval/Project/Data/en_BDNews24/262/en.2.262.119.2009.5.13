<TITLE> US commander must enforce Afghan attack rules: UN </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Islamabad, May 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The new commander of US and NATO forces in Afghanistan will have to ensure respect for rules set by his predecessor that have cut the number of civilian casualties despite recent bloodshed, a UN envoy said. In a surprise move, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates removed the top U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan on Monday and picked a former special forces commander to oversee President Barack Obama's strategy against a growing Taliban insurgency. The change comes amid increased tension between Washington and Kabul over reports that scores of civilians were killed in U.S. air raids in the western province of Farah last week. U.N. envoy for Afghanistan Kai Eide said in an interview in Islamabad on Tuesday that outgoing commander General David McKiernan had made "tremendous efforts" to establish rules for the use of air power and cut the number of civilian casualties. With U.S. reinforcements on the way and fighting expected to intensify, it was vital that new commander Lieutenant General Stanley McChrystal ensured the rule were kept, Eide said. "It is one of the most important tasks that a new commander will have, to make sure that with all of these additional troops, and with intensified fighting this summer, that the rules set by General McKiernan are respected," Eide said. Afghan President Hamid Karzai has said as many as 130 civilians may have been killed in Farah and he has demanded the United States halt air strikes. Without giving any figure, the United States says the toll was probably lower and it cannot fight without air power. A spokesman for Karzai said earlier he hoped the new commander would take more steps to reduce civilian deaths. LOWER TREND But Eide said the trend was already lower with fewer Afghans killed by international forces this year compared with the same period last year. "In spite of the recent incident in Farah, we've seen a lowering of the number of civilian casualties caused by international military forces," he said. "The challenge, with almost 20,000 troops coming in, will be to maintain the trend." Eide said he did not believe a ban on the use of air power, as demanded by Karzai, was the right step. But rules on air power had to be reviewed in light of the Farah incident and kept under constant observation. "To ban the use of an asset which could be of critical importance to troop-contributing nations and could influence their decision to deploy troops -- that is very hard." U.N. investigators had been unable to reach the villages in Farah where the civilians were killed and the truth of the incident might never be known, he said. "It is quite clear to me that a number of civilians have been killed by the Taliban during the fighting. It's also quite obvious that civilians were killed during the bombing," he said. "What the ratio is, it's too early to say. Maybe we will never know." Eide, in Pakistan for a two-day regional economic conference on Afghanistan beginning on Wednesday, welcomed an improvement in relations between the uneasy neighbours. Ties were often tense between Karzai and former Pakistani leader Pervez Musharraf, in particular over Afghan complaints Pakistan was not doing enough to tackle militants in remote enclaves on the Pakistani side of the border. Pakistan last week launched a major offensive against Taliban militants in the Swat valley, northwest of Islamabad, and Eide said progress against the insurgency in Pakistan would have a positive impact on security in Afghanistan.
