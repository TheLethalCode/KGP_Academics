 Amit Talukdar bdnews24.com Legal Affairs Correspondent Dhaka , May 11 (bdnews24.com)A fourth High Court bench, formed on Sunday by the chief justice, declined on Monday to hear the petition by opposition leader Khaleda Zia against the government notice to vacate her Dhaka Cantonment house. The bench of justices Md Anwarul Haque and Farah Mahbub chief justice MM Ruhul Amin constituted yesterday after a third bench felt embarrassed to hear the petition said it was unable to hear the appeal. It referred the case to the chief justice for further orders. Md Anwarul Haque, the senior judge of the bench, told lawyers in the court that he had given his views in the file concerning the house as a government official. He would not be able to hear any petition on the matter, as the code of conduct for the judges stipulated, he added. At the start of the hearing, Khaleda's lawyer TH Khan appealed for more time. The court said the bench was unable to hear the petition, but it did not feel embarrassed. Khan said the bench was obligated to hear the petition according to the oath of office of the judges. "But you are breaching the oath." Justice Haque showed him the code of conduct. "A judge will be unable to hear any petition if s/he gave opinion on the matter earlier," he said. "As I had given my opinion on the matter earlier I am not able to hear the petition," Justice Haque said. Another counsel for Khaleda, Moudud Ahmed, said the court could examine the matter after hearing the petition. Additional attorney general MK Rahman and Murad Reza stood for the state. On Sunday, another bench, of justices Jinat Ara and A K M Abdul Hakim, feeling embarrassed had sent the file to the chief justice. Khaleda's lawyer, Mahbub Uddin Khokan said on Sunday, a legal notice would be served to cancel the supplementary notice. On May 3, the bench of justices Ara and Hakim had admitted the petition and adjourned the hearing until Sunday on the attorney general's assurance that the government would not move in a week to evict the former prime minister. Earlier two other benches had declined to hear the appeal. The bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Quamrul Islam Siddiqui had felt embarrassed to hear the petition that sought a stay on the government order. Another bench, made of justices Tariqul Hakim and M Azizul Haque that had permitted the lawyers for the opposition leader to submit an affidavit prior to filing the writ appeal felt, also felt embarrassed. Military lands and cantonments directorate served Khaleda the notice on April 20 asking her to vacate her cantonment house. In a modified notice on May 7, it asked the opposition BNP chief to leave the house within 15 days. The cabinet on April 8 cancelled the lease on the house on grounds that the leasing process had been faulty and she violated lease terms. Khaleda responded to the government's first notice with a legal notice of her own on Apr 23. After murder of her husband, army chief-turned-president Ziaur Rahman on May 30, 1981 during a military uprising, his widow, Khaleda, was given another house in Gulshan in addition to the house in the cantonment the family had been living since the 1970s. The 2.72-acre mansion was originally the official home of the army chief, a position held by then Lt Gen Zia who then converted himself into a civilian head of state through martial law proclamations and controversial votes. Before the cabinet took the decision to cancel the lease, prime minister Sheikh Hasina said in parliament that she would ask the slain general's wife to vacate the house and that blocks of apartments would be built in the prime land for families of army officers killed in the Feb mutiny. b
