 Dhaka, May 12 (bdnews24.com)The BGMEA took a dig at the government on Tuesday for 'doing nothing' to protect the violence-torn readymade garment industries from unions and NGOs, and said they were worried about the future of nearly $11 billion industry. "The entrepreneurs of the garment industry are suffering from a lack of security" said Abdus Salam Murshedi , president of Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Expoerters' Association said at a news conference at the organisation's office in Dhaka. "We want security and demand exemplary punishment of the extortionists and killers." Readymade garments are the country's main export, accounting for $10.7 billion, or 76 percent, of its annual export income in the fiscal year to June 2008. The apparel industry employs some 34 lakh people. "We have called you at a critical time when it is being asked whether the garment industries will exist in the face of worsening law and order in the garment sector," he said hours after the father-in-law of Delwar Hossain, owner of Tuba Garments at Gulshan, was gunned down. "The criminals were threatening Delwar over phone but we got no remedy even after informing the law enforcers," he alleged. Murshedi said over the last few days extortionists had been demanding money at many garment factories and threatening them with death in case the money was not paid.. "Some 25 garment factory owners received death threats over huge amount of extortion," he also said "We talked to the home minister over the worsening security situation but to no avail." Murshedi suggested formation of industry police and increase the number of force in police stations adjacent to the industrial zone. He also demanded effective measures to prevent subversive activities inside the industries. b
