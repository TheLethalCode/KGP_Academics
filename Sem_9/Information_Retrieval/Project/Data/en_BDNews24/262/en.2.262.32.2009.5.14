The decision to waive the increased amount for just one semester came from a meeting of board of directors of the university held Wednesday night on its new campus at Basundhara, PRO Masudur Rahman told bdnews24.com. "The waiver will be applicable only to current students," Iqbalur Rahman Rokon, proctor of the university, told bdnews24.com.

Old students, according to the existing rates, will pay Tk 4000 for per credit, Tk 1000 for student activity fee and Tk 1000 for Computer Lab Fee. They do not pay any library fees. In Feb, the NSU had responded to demands from students and guardians to freeze fees, the authorities said at a press conference Tuesday. But the new students were not spared. Hiked admission fees, a written notice later had said. 10, would be applicable only for those who will be admitted a new this year, they added. The university authorities announced the latest hike through its website on May 7 and said the new fees would be applicable for all. The students were on vacation during the announcement. The authorities hiked student activity fees to Tk 2,000 from Tk 1,000, computer lab fees to Tk 1,500 from Tk 1,000 and introduced Tk 500 more as library fee. Credit fees were also hiked by Tk 500. The students rose in protest. Scores of students were injured on Sunday as the police used baton on them while they took to the streets and allegedly vandalised the campus property while protesting the hike in fees. The Gulshan police filed the case on the night against some 500 unnamed students, charged with vandalising university property and attacking law-enforcers. Students said the hike ranged between 10 and 25 percent. Over 1000 students and guardians protested the fee hike in a press conference Tuesday. Students, on the day, also asked the authorities not to take any administrative action against their fellows who demonstrated against the authorities' decision to hike tuition fees.
