 Kuala Lampur, May 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Malaysia's appeals court on Tuesday granted a stay of execution of a lower court order restoring the opposition government in the northwestern state of Perak, the Sun newspaper said. The ruling came a day after the High Court ruled that the government acted illegally in toppling the elected state government in Perak without conduction a "no confidence" vote in the state assembly. The dispute is a litmus test for the administration of new Prime Minister Najib Razak as it tries to prevent new polls in the contested state that could see the government stumble to yet another electoral defeat.
