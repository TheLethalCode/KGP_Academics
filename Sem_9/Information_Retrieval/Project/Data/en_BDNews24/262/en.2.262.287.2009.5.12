 KARACHI, Pakistan, May 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan spin bowler Saeed Ajmal has been sent to Australia in an attempt to get his action cleared before next month's Twenty20 World Cup in England. The Pakistan Cricket Board said on Tuesday that Ajmal had left for Perth, where his technique would be reviewed by Australian biomechanics expert Dr Bruce Elliot. Ajmal's bowling action was reported by ICC umpires during the recent one-day series against Australia in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. The 31-year-old off-spinner, who has taken eight wickets in 10 one-day internationals, has been named in Pakistan's World Cup squad that leaves for England on May 30 but will be replaced if his action fails to get clearance in Australia
