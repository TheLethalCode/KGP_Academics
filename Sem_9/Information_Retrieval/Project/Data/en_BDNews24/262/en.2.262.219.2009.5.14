Phil Jaques, Beau Casson, Ashley Noffke, Shaun Tait and Adam Voges all lost their contracts while Matthew Hayden and Stuart MacGill were not considered after retiring last season. "It's obviously a very exciting time for players receiving their first contract, such as Phillip Hughes, who has had an outstanding start for Australia and will have an important role in the team's future," Australia's chairman of selectors Andrew Hilditch said in a statement.

"It's obviously an important time for Australian cricket with the Ashes on the horizon. I can't talk specifically about Ashes selection today as that will be finalised next Wednesday morning," Hilditch said.

Contracted players for 2009/10: Doug Bollinger, Nathan Bracken, Stuart Clark, Michael Clarke, Callum Ferguson, Brad Haddin, Nathan Hauritz, Ben Hilfenhaus, Brad Hodge, James Hopes, Phillip Hughes, David Hussey, Mike Hussey, Mitchell Johnson, Simon Katich, Brett Lee, Graham Manou, Shaun Marsh, Andrew McDonald, Marcus North, Ricky Ponting, Peter Siddle, Andrew Symonds, Shane Watson, Cameron Wh
