 KABUL, Tue May 12, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Four suicide bombers blew themselves up in the southeastern Afghan town of Khost on Tuesday, a spokesman for a NATO force with troops in the town said. The blasts killed at least six people -- four army soldiers and two civilians -- and wounded 13, said Hamid Padshah, a doctor from a hospital in Khost, adding the toll may climb. Despite reinforcements to foreign forces in Afghanistan, violence has surged to its worst level in the past year, the bloodiest period since US-led troops overthrew the Taliban government more than seven years ago. A police source in Kabul, who asked not to be identified, said the suicide bombers attacked the governor's headquarters and a municipal administrative building. He had no details on casualties among officials and civilians. Another security source said some Taliban fighters made their way into two government buildings and a brief gunbattle had taken place between the assailants and government forces. State television said security forces had besieged the municipal administrative building with Taliban fighters inside. Several assailants were killed outside another government building, it said. Militants in recent years have staged a number of high-profile strikes in Khost, near the porous Pakistani border and separated by mountains from other parts of Afghanistan, including suicide attacks by Taliban insurgents. The spread of Taliban attacks in Afghanistan and neighbouring nuclear-armed Pakistan has raised alarm worldwide. The new US administration is sending 17,000 soldiers to Afghanistan in the next few months, about half of whom will be deployed in Helmand. They are part of a wave of reinforcements that will see the total US force increase from 32,000 at the start of this year to 68,000 by the year's
