Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said the Congress would emerge as the single largest party after election results were announced at the weekend and the ruling coalition could form the next government at the centre. The prime minister's comments were likely to boost several allies of the ruling United Progressive Alliance (UPA), who are unsure about their future in the UPA. Congress leaders are already trying to woo back coalition partners like the Rashtriya Janata Dal, who deserted them before the country's staggered election got underway.

He said the Congress was "not untouchable", but added a decision would be taken only after the election results were announced. The Congress party has already indicated they were willing to take support of their former allies, who supported the government for four years, before withdrawing support over a civilian nuclear deal last year.
