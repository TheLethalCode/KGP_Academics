 Dhaka, May 13 (bdnews24.com)The High Court on Wednesday overturned a lower court judgement that sentenced Naser Rahman, son of former finance minister Saifur Rahman, to nine years in prison in Tk 2 crore extortion case. Two engineers, Abdul Khaleq and Shafiqul Islam, who were sentenced each to five years in jail in the case, were also not found guilty. The bench of justices Md Arayesuddin and Md Abu Tariq deliver the judgment on the appeal of the two engineers. "They were granted bail by High Court before," said barrister Rehan Hossain, the lawyer for the defendants. They were sentenced by the additional district and sessions judge of Sylhet on Sept 18, 2007. The same year they appealed to the High Court against the verdict. Deputy attorney general Kazi Izarul Haque Sagar took part in the hearing from government's side. The case was filed by contractor Nuruzzaman with the Kotowali Police Station of Sylhet on Feb 17, 2007. bd
