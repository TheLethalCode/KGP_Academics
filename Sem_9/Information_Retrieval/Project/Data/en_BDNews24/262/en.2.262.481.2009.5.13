 Chittagong, May 13 (bdnews24.com)  The court has given the CID police another 70 days to investigate the 10-truck arms haul case in Chittagong. Chittagong metropolitan sessions judge Bhabani Prasad Singh granted the time after the senior police superintendent of Criminal Investigation Department Moniruzzaman Chowdhury, who is investigating the case, petitioned for three more months. "The time of investigation has been increased to July 22," metropolitan public prosecutor advocate Kamal Uddin told bdnews24.com. Wednesday was the last day to complete the investigation. Another petition has been filed with at the court for cancelling bail of eight defendants. "The petition has been filed because the defendants should be quizzed for the investigation," Uddin said. The defendants are Haji Abdus Sobhan, Kabir Ahmed, Mohammad Rafiq, Munir Ahmed, Abdul Mannan, Abdul Malek, Monjurul Alam and Munir Ahmed, deceased. On Nov 19, 2007, then metropolitan public prosecutor Ahsanul Haque Hena petitioned the court for more investigation. Later CID assistant police superintendent Ismail Hossain was appointed new investigating in line with a court order. But he could not move the investigation forward even after getting two time extensions. Then the state petitioned for changing IO on Jan 18, 2008. Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Limited officials for arms delivery and quay, coast guard, truck owner, police and intelligence agency NSI officials were quizzed after Moniruzzaman took over. Among them, four have been arrested afresh and seven gave confessional statement at court. Police seized ten trucks of arms at the CUFL jetty on the bank of Karnaphuli River on April 1, 2004. Two separate cases, arms and smuggling, were filed by officer-in-charge of Karnaphuli Police Station Ahadur Rahman the next day. The eight defendants were arrested at different times after that incident who later secured bail. bdne
