 Dhaka, May 13 (bdnews24.com)  Favourites FC Ashgabat begin their AFC President's Cup campaign on Thursday taking on Sri Lanka Army at the Bangabandhu National Stadium. Bangladesh Television will telecast the Group B second match live from the venue at 6:00pm. Turkmenistan's FC Ashgabat, the semi-finalists of the last edition President's Cup, are being considered the top favourite in Group B and it seems they were not worried with Thursday's match against Sri Lanka Army, who went 2-1 down to the hosts Abahani, the other contenders in the group. The FC Ashgabat had their first training at the BNS on Wednesday and the players looked upbeat in the training. "We are not thinking of the match against Sri Lanka Army or even the group-phase matches as our main target is to clinch the trophy this edition and we are very confident to achieve our goals," FC Ashgabat manager Sahatov Nurgeldy told reporters during the training session on Wednesday. The FC Ashgabat are studded with eight national players and have been training for last two months, especially for this tournament. Having watched the Sri Lanka Army's first match against Abahani, it never seemed that the Lanka had something in their armour to beat a team like Abahani and undoubtedly, they will have to show something special against a former Soviet-block team, which are technically, physically and tactically sound than the South Asian teams. Sri Lankan coach Major Pathmanathan, however, on Tuesday at a press conference said that they would show fighting spirit in both of the games they would play. bd
