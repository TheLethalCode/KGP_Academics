<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 11 (bdnews24.com)The Prime Minister's Office has asked the Public Service Commission to take initiatives to resolve the problems over the disputed 27th BCS examinations. Referring to "directives of the prime minister", a PMO director, Md Maksudul Haque, wrote to the PSC secretary on May 5. "Complications regarding the 27th BCS exams should be resolved," Haque said in his letter. "Especially the issue of freedom fighters' family members should be sorted out. It is not clear why the future of so many young people was ruined." The parliamentary standing committee on establishment ministry has formed a subcommittee to suggest ways out of the mess. The committee that sits on Tuesday is expected to submit a report next month. Citing irregularities and political favouritism, the government halted medical tests of the selected candidates on Jan 21, 2007 after publication of the final results. The PSC then cancelled the oral results. The candidates went through the interviews again, and many of them selected earlier failed to qualify. The candidates, successful in the first test and dropped after the second scrutiny, felt they were unfairly treated and staged demonstrations in protest. Recently, the Supreme Court ruled out the petition filed by the students. The past caretaker government had said it would consider the cases of 'deprived' students. bdnew
