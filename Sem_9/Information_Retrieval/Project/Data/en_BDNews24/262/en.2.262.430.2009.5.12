 Dhaka, May 12 (bdnews24.com)  Abahani took a step closer to claiming the AFC President's Cup after defeating Sri Lanka Army 2-1 in their Group B opener at the Bangabandhu National Stadium on Tuesday. Defender Wali Faisal put the Sky Blues ahead in the 42nd minute but two minutes later Ghanaian Samad Yousuf scored an own goal before substitute striker Shahazuddin Tipu slotted a 75th minute winner. Abahani will now play their second and final match on Saturday against FC Ashgabat of Turkmenistan, who square off against Sri Lanka Army on Thursday. Abahani, studded with six national players were the far better side enjoying the majority of the ball procession from the start, but the players appeared to lack concentration. Though Wali Faisal and Jahed Parvez Chowdhury released crosses from both flanks nobody able to take advantage. Abahani should have taken the lead in the 12th minute but midfielder Abul Hossain was late to negotiate a Mamunul Islam corner while Jahid Hasan Emily nodded a Jahed cross straight to opponent goalkeeper Abiduduge Priyanga Ruwan in the 21st minute. Awudu Ibrahim came close to grabbing the lead when the Ghanaian striker capitalising on a square pass from Jahed, dragged narrowly wide of the far post in the 38th minute. Three minutes later the hosts were deprived of a certain goal after Sri Lanka Army defender Sanka Wijesiri cleared a Abul Hossain header off the line. Defender Wali Faisal gave Abahani a 42nd minute leader with an astonishing right-footer outside the box that rolled into the net after kissing the near post. But within two minutes Sri Lankan striker Izzadeen drove a shot to the far post inside the box and Abahani defender Samad found his own net while attempting to clear the ball, which was seemingly drifting wide. After resumption, striker Emily, who played in the AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers as a substitute, was presented a free header by Wali, the country's best striker but he failed to connect just one minute into the second half. The energetic visitors tried everything but they could not break the Abahani backline marshalled Samad, Sujan, Siraji and Wali and Abahani coach Amolesh Sen sent on Shahajuddin Tipu in place of Emily after 73 minutes. The substitute striker settled the game two minutes later as he found the back of the net with a powerful shot at the second attempt. bd
