 Dhaka, May 12 (bdnews24.com)Students of North South University Tuesday asked the authorities not to take any administrative action against their fellows who demonstrated against the authorities' decision to hike tuition fees. They also demanded withdrawal of cases filed on Monday against some 500 unnamed students, charged with vandalising university property and attacking law-enforcers. The students in a press conference at National Press Club said they would submit a memorandum to the University Grants Commission chairman, wear black badges on the university campus on May 13 and declared May 10 as "the black day". Students said the recent hike ranged between 10 and 25 percent. The NSU authorities hiked student activity fees to Tk 2,000 from Tk 1,000, computer lab fees to Tk 1,500 from Tk 1,000 and introduced Tk 500 more as library fee. Credit fees were also hiked by Tk 500, they said. Scores of students were injured on Sunday as the police used baton on them while they took to the streets and allegedly vandalised the campus property while protesting the hike in fees. The Gulshan police filed the case the same night. bd
