 LONDON, May 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The decision of the umpires will be final in this year's Ashes series after the International Cricket Council (ICC) said players would not be allowed to challenge close calls. However, cricket's governing body said trials of the controversial video review system over the past nine months had been positive and it could be introduced in a "phased roll-out" from October.

"I'm excited the committee concluded the umpire decision review system had a positive effect on the game," ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat said in a statement.

TRIAL PERIOD Lorgat said lessons learned during the trial period would be evaluated between now and October with further training given to match officials. The ICC board and ICC chief executive committee will meet in June to decide whether to rubber-stamp the system on a permanent basis. The Ashes series between England and Australia starts with the first test in Cardiff from July 8-12. Also on the agenda at Lord's was the possibility of a day-night test being staged in 2010. "The committee recognised the need to promote test cricket and was happy for talks on this matter to advance. However, before it gave the concept the green light it agreed several aspects needed to be firmed up first," Lorgat said. One of the worries is the colour of the ball. Trials are being carried out on various alternatives to the traditional red ball that would not be suitable under lights
