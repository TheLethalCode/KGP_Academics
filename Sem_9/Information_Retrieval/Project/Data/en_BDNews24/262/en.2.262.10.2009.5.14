 Dhaka, May 14 (bdnews24.com)The main opposition BNP has asked the government to fast-track the trial of the 'real perpetrators' of the Feb 25-26 BDR mutiny and go public with the findings. The party formed human chains in all districts and Upazila across the country on Thursday for one hour starting from 11am to reiterate the demands. "We want a proper and neutral investigation into the Peelkhana mutiny. But the government is trying to divert people's attention to hide the real culprits," secretary-general Khandaker Delwar Hossain told reporters from a human-chain programme in front of the National Press Club. Thousands of BNP leaders and activists formed chains in 19 spots from Jatrabri through Gabtoli in the capital carrying placards and portraits of party founder Ziaur Rahman and chairperson Khaleda Zia. Delwar was taken to BIRDEM Hospital immediately after he had fallen sick. Another BNP leader Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain said they wanted the investigation report of the Peelkhana carnage to be made public soon. "People want to know who were involved in the incident," he said. "People are now suffering from gas and power crises. They are worried about the law and order situation." The human-chain programme was a part of the party's month-long protest programme across the country. It would hold protest rallies on May 19 in the metropolitans, districts and Upazila to protest 'worsening law and order'. On April 23 Delwar announced the protest programmes also demanding an end to power, water, gas crises. The programme started on May 5. bdne
