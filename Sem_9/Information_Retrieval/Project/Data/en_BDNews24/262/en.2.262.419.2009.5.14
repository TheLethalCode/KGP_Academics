 VALENCIA, Spain, May 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Three goals in a devastating nine-minute spell at the start of the second half saw Barcelona to a 4-1 win over Athletic Bilbao in the King's Cup final on Wednesday and the first of three possible titles. Yaya Toure levelled for Barca in the first half before Lionel Messi, Bojan Krkic and Xavi struck after the break to give the club their 25th King's Cup. The Catalans could wrap up the Primera Liga title this weekend and they face Manchester United in the Champions League final on May 27. "The title is a reward for the players and all the people who have worked so hard to get us here," Guardiola told reporters. "Now we need to win the league as soon as possible so we can can prepare well for the Champions League final in Rome."

Just before Xavi's goal the match was held up briefly after Barcelona defender Daniel Alves was hit on the head by a tin can thrown from the stands. Alves was able to continue and television pictures showed police leading a fan away. Athletic, who have won the cup 23 times, were a broken team after that, but earn a place in next season's Europa League with Barca's place in the Champions League assured for next year. Bilbao's Spain striker Fernando Llorente told Radio Marca: "In the first half we had some chances, but in the second half they were much better.
