 KARACHI, Mon May 11, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police in the Pakistani city of Karachi were on alert on Monday, the eve of the second anniversary of bloody clashes between ethnic-based factions in the commercial hub. The provincial government has announced a public holiday and a day of mourning for Tuesday amid fear of violence after at least 27 people were killed last month in clashes in the country's biggest city. "We have not received any specific threats but we will be on alert to handle any situation," said a police official. Nearly 40 people were killed and about 150 wounded in two days of violence that began on May 12, 2007, when rival pro- and anti-government factions clashed when the country's then-suspended chief justice tried to visit supporters in the city. A central bank spokesman said Tuesday would not be a bank holiday. The main Karachi Stock Exchange was also expected to be open although exchange spokesmen were not available for comment. While stock investors are getting used to militant violence in the northwest, violence in Karachi has a more immediate market impact. The city has long been a tinder box. Serious violence between rival factions was common in the 1990s. The tension is between mohajirs, the descendents of Urdu-speaking people who migrated from India after the creation of Pakistan in 1947, and ethnic Pashtuns migrants from the northwest. Mohajirs are the city's biggest community and dominate the city's administration. The Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), which represents mohajirs and has been the dominant political force in Karachi for years, has raised fears of "Talibanisation" of Karachi by Pashtuns. Analysts say city politics rather than a real Taliban threat are at the root of the tension. The MQM fears changing city demographics, in particular the arrival of more Pashtuns, will weaken its power base. The Karachi Stock Exchange's benchmark 100-share index was up 0.3 percent by 0605 GMT. All provincial government offices and schools and colleges in Sindh province, of which Karachi is capital, will be closed on Tue
