<TITLE> Congress may lose key seats in Tamil Nadu </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CHENNAI, Tue May 12, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - In Tamil Nadu, a key southern state just a few miles from war-torn Sri Lanka, a coalition led by the Congress party may lose vital seats it needs to forge a winning alliance after the mammoth general election. A Congress party-led front swept prosperous Tamil Nadu in a whitewash in 2004, earning a large seat windfall seen as crucial to the party's surprise victory at national level. The state goes to the vote on Wednesday in the last stage of a month-long, staggered election. National results will be released on Saturday. But this time Congress has lost allies in the state -- two local parties and its former communist partners walked out -- and faces the resurgence of a party that once ruled Tamil Nadu and could become a powerbroker after the April-May polls. Boasting 39 out of India's 543 parliamentary seats, Tamil Nadu is one of the biggest prizes in a national battle between Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party. Both national parties rely on regional groups to win power, and Congress will probably need its main ally in Tamil Nadu, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), to help it gain a parliamentary majority. But a slew of grievances, including power cuts and high prices, may eat into the DMK, one of several signs across India that Congress's coalition allies may be struggling under the weight of economic problems. "Congress is worried about Tamil Nadu because they know the DMK front has become weak," Cho S. Ramaswamy, a political commentator, said in the capital Chennai. Snapping at Congress' heels is the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), led by Jayalalithaa, which once ruled the state but won no seats in parliament five years ago. Jayalalithaa, has joined the country's "Third Front", a group of smaller parties presenting themselves as an alternative to India's two giant coalitions. Investors see the bloc as an unknown quantity and worry about its rise as India grapples with the global economic crisis. A win for Jayalalithaa could boost the Third Front, which is led by the communists, but she is unpredictable and has allied in the past with both the BJP and Congress. In Tamil Nadu, there is no "sense of logic or loyalty when it comes to alliances", wrote Vir Sanghvi in the Hindustan Times. NO POWER TO THE PEOPLE Tamil Nadu has one of India's highest GDPs and is home to several foreign big hitters such as mobile phone maker Sony Ericsson and automobile giant Ford. Grand, smoothly paved flyovers criss-cross Chennai, pointing to the capital's growing prosperity and future aspirations. But industry and poorer voters alike complain of severe electricity shortages that hit the state in recent months as Tamil Nadu struggles to keep pace with its recent economic boom. Power cuts, high prices of basic goods and services, and an export sector hit by the slowdown could eclipse the DMK's schemes to woo voters, such as rice subsidies and free colour TVs. Both the DMK and its main rival ratcheted up rhetoric against the Sri Lankan government over Tamil civilians trapped in a tiny war zone, as the army tries to finish off the Tamil Tiger rebels fighting for a separate Tamil homeland. The state has been hit by protests and strikes in recent months as news of civilian casualties in Sri Lanka's war against Tamil Tiger rebels spread north. Critics say both parties in the state home to 60 million Tamils are posturing for political gain. Kunnam village is 50 km from Chennai and just a short drive from where former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, the husband of Congress chief Sonia, was killed by a suspected Tiger suicide bomber in 1991 and where a granite memorial now stands. In this area, local grievances, not Sri Lanka, dominate. "We are more concerned about our day-to-day living. We don't know much about Sri Lanka," said Roja, who runs a tiny food stall. "Life is a struggle. We have been given a free colour TV and gas stoves but we can't afford a gas connect
