 Dhaka, May 14 (bdnews24.com)The parliamentary panel investigating alleged corruption of former speaker Jamiruddin Sircar on Thursday served a summons on him, his deputy Akhter Hamid Siddiqui and former chief whip Khandaker Delwar Hossain to appear before the committee on June 10. The report on the findings of the investigation will be published on May 31 before it is discussed in parliament, Fazle Rabbi Mian, who heads the 11-stong body speaker Abdul Hamid formed on Mar 19, told reporters at parliament building on Thursday. The committee also questioned six public servants involved in the alleged irregularities in appointing staff to the parliament secretariat in 'violation of rules', he added. "No people should be punished unheard. They must get the chance to defend themselves," he had said on May 5 when the panel decided to issue summons. Mian said Thursday's meeting reviewed reports by two sub-committeesone on probing Sircar's 'corruption' in appointing staff and the other on misuse of the speaker's medical fund. Another sub-committee investigating purchase during Sircar's tenure would submit its findings soon, Mian said. The Mian committee at its April 13 meeting formed three sub-committees to make the investigation transparent. In the face of demands by the MPs, speaker Abdul Hamid formed the all-party probe committee to investigate the alleged irregularities by Sircar. The committee has also been investigating spending during Sircar's predecessor Abdul Hamid's time. Speaker Hamid was also elected speaker in July 2001 and served until Sircar replaced him on Oct 28, 2001. The committee is supposed to submit the findings to the speaker by May 20. 'No authority' Delwar on May 6 questioned the authority of the parliamentary standing committee to issue summons. Now opposition BNP secretary general, he said the committee had no jurisdiction to summon him. "The parliament speaker has no authority to convene such committees. And, no such committee can call anyone to clarify one's position about anything," Delwar had said. "There are valid questions about the way the particular parliamentary standing committee was convened." The committee convened to investigate former speaker Jamiruddin Sircar has now been deployed to look into the doings of the former deputy speaker and chief whip, which is not right, he added. He had also trashed the graft charge against him. "This has been a political moveill conceived and purposely done to ruin my political career and the image of my family."
