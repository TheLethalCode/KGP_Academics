 Dhaka , May 11 (bdnews24.com)Opposition leader Khaleda Zia has served the government with a legal notice to cancel the supplementary notice it had sent to her on May 7 to vacate the Dhaka Cantonment house, according to her lawyer. The former prime minister's counsel Mahbubuddin Khokan sent the notice last night by courier service and registered post asking the government to withdraw notice within 5 days. The notice was served on the defence secretary, cabinet secretary, the director of military land and cantonment directorate, the military land administrator and military estate officer. Khokan told bdnews24.com Monday that an illegal notice remained illegal despite changes and the modification proved that the first notice had been illegal. "Serving a supplementary notice while the writ petition is pending amounts to contempt of court and the second notice is contradictory to the first notice." In the notice it is stated that the supplementary notice is malafide, illegal and without jurisdiction and it has been served only to disrupt the process of law and with ulterior motive. "The supplementary notice served after filing the writ petition amounts to fraud on the court in as much that you have tried to subvert and undermine the Supreme Court against the established norms of the judicial process," the notice said. In a modified notice on May 7, it asked the BNP chief to leave the house within 15 days. The cabinet on April 8 cancelled the lease on the house on grounds that the leasing process had been faulty and she violated lease terms. Khaleda responded to the government's first notice with a legal notice of her own on Apr 23
