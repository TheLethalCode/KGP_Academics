 TEHRAN, Tue May 12, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US-born journalist Roxana Saberi is in good spirits and may leave Iran next week after she was acquitted on charges of spying for the United States, her lawyer said on Tuesday. Lawyer Abdolsamad Khorramshahi, speaking a day after Saberi's eight-year jail sentence was cut to a two-year suspended term, praised the appeal court's handling of the case as "very just."

Saberi, a citizen of both the United States and Iran, was arrested in January for working in the Islamic Republic after her press credentials had expired. She was later accused of spying, a charge that can carry the death sentence. The United States had said the spying charges were baseless and demanded her immediate release. Tehran does not recognize dual nationality and told Washington not to interfere. The two countries were already locked in an acrimonious dispute over Iran's nuclear program, which the West fears is aimed at making arms. Iran says it is to generate electricity. Obama has offered Iran a fresh start in relations, though Iran says Washington must first show real policy ch
