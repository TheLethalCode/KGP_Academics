 Dhaka May 13 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman has asked the chief executives of private banks not to allow the boards to meddle in the routine business. "The chairmen and directors are sometimes interfering in daily banking transactions and playing chief executives which is in no way acceptable" the central bank chief said at a meeting with the chief executives of the government, private and foreign banks on Wednesday But, he said, the chief executives had no reason to feel helpless as bank company law guaranteed their job. "We are observing with great concern that they were flouting the rules and regulations prescribed by the central bank." Asked about what was discussed in the meeting, he said, "We have reminded them of the responsibilities of the chairmen, directors and chief executives of private banks which are specified in the bank company law." On Tuesday, the central bank warned the boards for flouting rules and interfering in the routine transactions. The central bank sent a circular to the banks cautioning them against the irregularities The circular signed by the general manager of Banking Regulatory and Policy Department, Abu Hena Mohammed Razi Hasan, said that BRPD on July 2003 had issued a circular on responsibilities and accountability of board of directors and managing directors. The 2003 circular had said that they were assigned to perform distinct roles in loan and risk management, internal control, human resource management and development, income and expenditure, and other non-financial activities. But Tuesday's circular stated that a recent study found that chairman of the board of directors and the boards were interfering in the day-to-day banking activities including loan sanctioning process and were taking part in administrative tasks beyond their responsibilities. It also alleged that some bank directors were using the transports, telephones and rooms of the banks for personal comfort and even recruiting employees and officials in violation of regulations. The irregularities are alarming and a bar to good governance, it said The circular asked the banks to follow the rules and regulations stipulated in the previous circular. bd
