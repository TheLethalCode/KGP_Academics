<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 11 (bdnews24.com)The government is now at the final stages of starting the trial of war crimes committed during the war of independence from Pakistan in 1971, the state minister for law said on Monday. "We've taken a final decision to try the war criminals and the process of forming a tribunal, appointing investigating agency and lawyers in line with International Crime (Tribunal) Act 1973 has been finalised," Kamrul Islam told reporters at the Secretariat.. "At this moment, cases should not be filed against them (alleged perpetrators) sporadically," Islam said. Earlier in the day, a Dhaka court served summons on former Jamaat-e-Islami chief Golam Azam, incumbent chief Matiur Rahman Nizami, secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammed Mojaheed, senior BNP leader Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury and 32 others to appear in court on July 20. The summons followed a petition filed on Nov. 11, 2008 seeking court orders declaring them 'war criminals' and barring them from running elections. The 36 are to explain why they should not be declared "war criminals". The minister said the court orders will have no bearings on the trial process and that there was no need to file cases in court. "The government's decision to hold the trial will be considered as the first information report." The investigating agency will place war crime proofs before court, Islam added. He said such a "huge task" required time. bdnew
