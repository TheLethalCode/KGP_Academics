 Dhaka, May 13 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary watchdog has commissioned a committee to investigate alleged irregularities in the hajj management. The parliamentary standing committee on religious affairs ministry formed the body at a meeting on Wednesday as Hajj Association of Bangladesh and the ministry officials traded blames for the suffering to hundreds of thousands of pilgrims since 2001. Ruling Awami League MP Bazlul Haq Harun will head the committee which is to present its findings by the end of current month or early June, the standing committee chairman says. "The ministry officials tried to accuse the HAB of the hajj mismanagement in the past. "On the other hand, HAB put blame on the ministry officials for the same," Mojibor Rahman, the committee chairman, told bdnews24.com after the meeting at parliament building. "To know the causes of mismanagement in the hajj, we formed the sub-committee." A B M Abul Kashem, Sadhan Chandra Majumder, A K M A Awal and Motiur Rahman are the other members of the committee. The media quoting hajj pilgrims reported massive irregularities in the hajj almost every year since assumption of power by the BNP-led government in 2001. Renting houses for pilgrims in Mecca and Madina is one of the alleged areas of corruption, according to media reports.
