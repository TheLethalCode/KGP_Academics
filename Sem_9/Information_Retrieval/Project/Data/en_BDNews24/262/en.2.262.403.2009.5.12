<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 12 (bdnews24.com) A High Court bench Tuesday revoked its previous orders that halted the proceedings of an extortion case filed in 2007 by businessman Azam J Chowdhury against Sheikh Hasina, in what could be seen as a first step towards withdrawal of the case itself. The bench of justices ABM Khairul Haque and Md Mamtaj Uddin Ahmed made the orders on a petition filed by the prime minister. A lawyer for Hasina said the step was necessary to process her petition to withdraw the case. Azam Chowdhury has maintained he did not want to sue Hasina and indicated he was forced to sign the case documents under pressure from certain quarters in the military-installed caretaker government. The High Court on Sept 16 last year granted Hasina bail and froze the proceedings of the case. Barrister Rafiq-ul-Huq represented Hasina in the hearing while barrister Sheikh Fazle Nur Taposh assisted him. Taposh told bdnews24.com after the ruling that the prime minister had appealed for withdrawal of the case and that the stay order had to go first to proceed further with her plea. An appeal was filed with the HIgh Court on May 10 seeking withdrawal of the case. The home ministry in a circular on Jan 1 said it would accept petitions to withdraw 'cases for political persecution'. The businessman, whose interests range from energy to banking, filed the case against Hasina and her cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, a former minister, on June 13, 2007. He charged them with accepting a Tk 3 crore "bribe" from him. The charge sheet, submitted on July 24, 2007, later included Hasina's younger sister Sheikh Rehana. Charge framing against the accused was conducted on Jan 13 in the Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court. b
