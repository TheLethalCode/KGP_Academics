 Dhaka, May 12 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary watchdog will recommend against the plan to introduce 'creative questions system' in Secondary School Certificate exams from 2010, its chief says. Rashed Khan Menon, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on education ministry, said on Tuesday they would put forward the recommendations by two weeks. A final decision on the issue would be based on the recommendations and opinions from the stakeholders, education minister Nurul Islam Nahid said. Both spoke to reporters after a view-exchange meeting at National Academy for Education Management. Opinions were be elicited from educationists and parents of students at the programme which the parliamentary standing committee hosted on 'running creative questing system'. The ministry on Apr 20 had decided to run creative questioning system in Bengali first paper and religious studies from 2010 SSC exams. The system was to be followed for all subjects from 2011. Some parents have been demanding that the system not be run from 2010 on the grounds that the students were not prepared yet. Educationists Abdullah Abu Sayeed and Muhammad Ibrahim and Ratan Kumar Roy, director of secondary education sector development project, endorsed the introduction of the system while some guardians opposed. bdne
