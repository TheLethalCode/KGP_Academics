<TITLE> Bomb blast hits bank in Athens, no injuries </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Athens, May 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A powerful bomb damaged a bank in Athens early on Tuesday but caused no injuries, police said. The bomb, placed outside the Greek bank Eurobank in the southeastern Argyroupoli district, was the latest in a string of attacks that have rocked the Greek capital in recent months. "We believe it is a terrorist attack, the anti-terrorism squad is investigating the remnants of the bomb and the area," said a police source who declined to be named. Greece has suffered a string of anarchist and leftist bombing and arson attacks aimed at domestic and foreign firms since widespread rioting in December that was provoked by the police killing of a teenager. An unidentified caller warned a Greek newspaper about Tuesday's attack about 10 minutes before the bomb exploded, the police source added.
