<TITLE> No more new tax holidays: Muhith </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 14 (bdnews24.com)Finance minister AMA Muhith said on Thursday there will be no more tax holiday in the next budget to encourage new industries. But the institutions already enjoying the facility will continue to do so until the time specified. New production-focused industries will be given tax facilities through other measures, the minister said. "Industries established under tax holiday see profits as long as they enjoy the facility. But when the holiday ends, they count losses and eventually shut down," Muhith said at a pre-budget discussion organised by the Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Dhaka. "So, the next budget will not offer no tax holidays [to get the country] come out of this bad culture." The finance minister said the government would allow investment of undeclared income in some specific sectors in the next budget under strict conditions to boost investment, despite reservations from the MPs and the MCCI. On Wednesday, Muhith had said the government might allow investment of undeclared income in pharmaceutical, cement, toys, shoes and garments in the next budget. "The products are in great demand. So we are thinking about utilising undeclared money in these sectors," he had said. The next budget would stress on the farm sector to rev up rural economy, and on small and medium industries to generate jobs, he had said. "We've exchanged views with trade bodies, different professionals and MPs. Among them the MCCI and the MPs have been against providing any opportunities to allow undisclosed income to be legalised," he said on Thursday. "The scope to legalise undisclosed money has been given since independence. But except during the emergency rule the facility did not bring results." "Still, considering the global economic recession and the country's economic condition the facility will be extended to some specific sectors under strict conditions to further investment," he said. One or two more sectors may be added to the five sectors, the minister added. Asked about the conditions, a smiling Muhith replied, "All the mysteries of the budget should not be disclosed before it is announced. I've said the conditions will be strict, you will see." Muhith repeated that the GDP will grow at six percent in the current 2008-09 fiscal year despite the ongoing global economic recession. But the year was going to be tough because of the financial downturn. It appeared that the economy will be shaken by the global recession in the next fiscal year, leading to slowdown in the GDP growth, he said. However, once the recession is over, the GDP will grow at 7.5 to 8 percent in FY 2010-11, he said and added that the government will put in its best efforts to achieve the growth. bdn
