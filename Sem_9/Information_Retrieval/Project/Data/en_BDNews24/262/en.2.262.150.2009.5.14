<TEXT>
 Rangpur, May 14 (bdnews24.com) Five narcotics control men sustained injuries on Wednesday night as an angry mob manhandled them for taking bribe from a drug peddler and freeing him after arrest. Local journalist Shada Miah and Union Parishad chairman Abed Khan said assistant sub-inspector Nazrul Islam and constables Serajul Islam, Motaleb and Saiful led by narcotics control office inspector Manaranjan Pal on Wednesday evening went up to Bishmail Kauar Pukur village market under Pirganj upazila, looking for drug dealers Bablu, Emran and Sahar Ali. The raiders found only Bablu and arrested him. A good number of onlookers thronged the scene. Meanwhile Bablu reached an understanding with his captors and they eventually freed him. People then got infuriated with them and beat them up. Later, when Khan informed Pirganj police, a police contingent led by officer in charge Jahangir Hossain went to the spot, rescued the five, secured them by tying rope around their waists and brought them to the police station the same night. Hossain, when contacted, said that the narcotics officials had not found Bablu at home. As the narcotics men were coming back, people mobbed them, the narcotics men claimed, he added. Hossain also said the statements of different narcotics men differed. He had filed a general diary mentioning all the details and would also send to the police superintendent a report so that departmental disciplinary actions may be taken against the government officials when found guilty. Inspector GM Abu Hasan representing the Rangpur narcotics control deputy director went to the police station and took his office colleagues as his own charges. The police chief added that the narcotics men on Wednesday led by executive magistrate Najmul Hasan had raided five spots, failed to arrest anyone, cancelled the hunt due to torrential rains, ordered the narcotics men to return . Hasan himself returned to Rangpur at 5:30pm. But the reason of their raiding the notorious drug dealers again on their own in that very village was not clear, the OC said.
