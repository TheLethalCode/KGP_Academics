 Chittagong, May 12 (bdnews24.com)The investigation officer has sought another three months from court to make headway into the sensational Chittagong 10-truck arms haul case. Senior assistant superintendent Moniruzzaman Chowdhury of the police's Criminal Investigation Department filed the appeal with the Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court on Tuesday, a day before the deadline, extended twice, ends. "To complete the investigation in line with the previous directives from the court more time is needed," metropolitan public prosecutor Kamal Uddin told bdnews24.com quoting Chowdhury. "Hearing on his appeal has been set for Wednesday," he added. The then metropolitan public prosecutor Ahsanul Haque Hena appealed for time for a detailed investigation on Nov 19, 2007. Later, the court ordered for appointment of a new investigation officer, and following the order assistant police superintendent of CID, Ismail Hossain, was appointed. Hossain took time from court in two phases, but could make no progress. After his failure, following another court order, Chowdhury took over as the investigation officer. bdnews
