 TBILISI, Mon May 11, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili met opposition leaders on Monday after a month of street protests aimed at forcing him from power. Saakashvili agreed to the talks after violent clashes with police and a brief mutiny at a tank base increased the possibility of wider unrest in Georgia, a U.S. ally and an important transit route for energy flows to Europe. The meeting coincides with NATO war games in the former Soviet republic that have been condemned by Russia.

Hundreds of soldiers from more than a dozen NATO members and partners arrived last week to prepare for "crisis response" and peacekeeping exercises. Putin criticized the Western alliance on Sunday for pressing ahead in spite of events in Georgia. "Against all this they decide to hold military exercises. It cannot be seen as anything but support for the ruling regime," he told Japanese media. Analysts question whether the opposition has the numbers or the unity to unseat Saakashvili. The longer the stalemate drags on, the greater the risk of violence. Police firing tear gas and rubber bullets dispersed mass demonstrations against Saakashvili in 2007, to the anger of his Western bac
