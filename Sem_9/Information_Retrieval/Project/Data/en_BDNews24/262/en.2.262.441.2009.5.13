 Dhaka, May 12 (bdnew24.com)The High Court has stayed the proceedings of the case filed against three officials of YKK, the global zipper giant by a Bangladeshi readymade garment manufacturer on charge of deception, embezzlement and intimidation. The bench of justices Syed Refat Ahmed and Mainul Isam Chowdhury gave the orders upon a writ petition filed by YKK on Tuesday. The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court, Dhaka granted three YKK officials bail seizing their passports after they surrendered to the court on Sunday. The three officers are vicepresident of YKK Bangladesh outlet, Hiroshi Ikusaka, factory manager Yoshimine Kobayashi and senior sales manager Md Monir Uddin. The petition stated that it could be a civil case rather than a criminal one. Barrister Tania Amir argued for the defendants in the case. Filing criminal case was unlawful and amounted to harassment, she said. On Feb 19, the managing director of Sikdar Apparels Ltd Shahidul Haq filed the case against three YKK officials and two American businessmen with Khilgaon Police Station. The US traders are the chairman of Kark Roberts Trading Corporation and its managing director Robert Frederick Bob According to the first information report of the case, Shikdar Apparels got a work order through YKK for making 2.44 lakh pieces of clothes worth $ 13 lakh. In exchange, YKK was to take zippers from them. A pre-shipment inspection firm, SGS, chosen by the buyer, checked the materials within the deadline and those were sent to Chittagong port for shipping. But the buyer delayed to accept the dresses on various excuses, the FIR says. The buyer and SGS later said the zippers were substandard. Later, the accused cancelled the work order on July 21, 2008. Bangladesh representatives of YKK zipper senior sales manager Md Munir Uddin and human resource manager Masud Karim refused to say anything and referred to their lawyer. bdnews24.co
