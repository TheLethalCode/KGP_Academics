They sought the bail in the court of metropolitan sessions judge A.N.M. Bashirullah who said he will hear their appeal on June 2. The three who turned themselves in are former CID assistant police superintendents Munshi Atiqur Rahman, Md Abdur Rashid and Md Ruhul Amin. They had also tried to secure bail after surrendering to the High Court on April 13. The bench of justices M A Wahab Mea and Marjeul Haque directed them to surrender to the trial court in eight weeks. ABM Waliur Khan, the lawyer for the accused, told bdnews24.com that the judge did not hear their bail petitions since the eight-week period had yet to expire, on Tuesday.
