 LONDON, May 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The English Premier League, under pressure from soccer's authorities and the British government, plans to bolster its financial regulations, notably toughening rules on who can own or invest in a club. The proposals are in response to a request from British Sports Minister Andy Burnham to the high profile league and the Football Association for plans to curb debt and increase financial transparency as the game comes to terms with the worst economic slump in nearly 80 years.
