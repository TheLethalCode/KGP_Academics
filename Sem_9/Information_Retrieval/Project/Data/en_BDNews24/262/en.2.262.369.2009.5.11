 Dhaka, May 11 (bdnews24.com)A Jatiya Party leader filed a libel suit against the daily Naya Diganta editor, the publisher and the reporter over a report that claimed , party chief HM Ershad threw a party with his new wife. Shamim Ahmed Rizvi, student and education affairs joint secretary of the party, filed the case in the court of the metropolitan magistrate on Monday. Magistrate Kanika Biswas asked the acting officer-in-charge of Paltan Police Station to submit a report on the issue to the court by July 15. Rizvi alleged that Naya Diganta in the first-page report on Sunday had said that Ershad along with new wife Mita had given a party at the Dhaka Club.

He said Ershad did not marry any woman by the name of Mita. He said people read the false news that damaged the image of the former president.
