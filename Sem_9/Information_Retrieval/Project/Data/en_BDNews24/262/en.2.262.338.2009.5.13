 Dhaka, May 13 (bdnews24.com)Textile and food processing would be the avenues to invest for Bangladeshi businesses in Uganda, the Ugandan vice president says. Gilbert B Bukenya said on Wednesday at a news conference at the BRAC Centre Inn in Dhaka that the Bangladeshi textile was very good in quality and that it had a huge market in the African country. "Bangladeshi textile's major destination is the US where you have to face issues like quota and tariffs, but in Uganda we have no such conditions." Bukenya, capping a six-day visit, also said his country was fertile but it lacked the technology to process foods. "The Bangladeshi food industry can invest in Uganda as there is demand for the sector." Currently, the trade volume between the two countries is very low, not more than $ 1 million, according to the Ugandan high commissioner. "It is on a very basic level; cotton and coffee are the main products that are traded," said Nimisha J Madhvani, the envoy who is posted in New Delhi. Bukenya arrived in the capital last Thursday to see the empowerment of the poor by BRAC, one of the largest NGOs of the world. He told the press briefing that BRAC was doing 'a terrific job' to empower power people. "I am highly impressed by BRAC's initiatives to mobilise local people to borrow money to establish enterprises." The Ugandan vice president also lauded the health programmes of BRAC, saying that it was helping the rural people. "The system of BRAC is a complete one for development." Replying to queries, Bukenya said about 32 percent of his country's population lived under the poverty line, less than $ 1 a day. He added that they would implement the ideas of BRAC in Uganda to empower the poor. Sharing his experience of the rural Bangladesh, Bekunya said that he found many similarities with his country, especially the mindset of the people. "However, the process of employment is quite different over here." Bukenya said the cottage textile industry has impressed him a lot. "The fabric made out of those hand looms are so fine that they can be sold anywhere in the world." The Ugandan vice president visited field level projects of BRAC including microcredit, community development, education, health, water and sanitation programmes in Manikganj, Gazipur and Savar. Bukenya also had a meeting with president Zillur Rahman. BRAC chairpreson Fazle Hasan Abed, and defence attach of Uganda to Bangladesh Brigadier Geoffrey Muhesi were also present at the press briefing.
