 Dhaka, May 13 (bdnews24.com)The new central bank governor has spelled out the jobs he wants to do in his four-year term, and setting pro-people, welfare banking system sits high on the agenda. "Establishing a pro-people, welfare banking system is my main goal and for that GDP growth and new job generation will be continued through a close relation between agriculture and industries sectors," said Atiur Rahman who took over as Bangladesh Bank governor on May 1. In his first meeting with bankers since assuming office, he said he will also work to ensure "eco-friendly banking by not giving loans to the sectors that damage the environment". He unveiled the three-page plan after explaining the economic condition at the meeting with state-run, private and foreign bank executives and asked them for help to execute it. Rahman reiterated his remark of extending policy supports to the government in controlling the prices of essentials and concerted effort to combat the fallout of the ongoing global recession. "At the moment our first and foremost duty is to fight the fallout of the global recession," the governor told reporters after the meeting. He the is the price of fuel oil was spiked in line with spiralling international prices, it will also push the fertiliser prices, which in turn will hike the production cost. "Taking all these things into consideration, the banks should provide loans very carefully," he said, adding the bank loans should go only to productive sector. Digital banking Rahman said the entire banking system including the central bank will be digitalised. Automatic payment system will be introduced so that one did not have to wait three to four days to have fund transferred to another bank after submitting a bank cheque. The Credit Information Bureau of the central bank will be digitalised so that the entrepreneurs get loans swiftly online. The private bank executives' body the Bangladesh Association of Bankers chairman Kazi Mahmud Sattar also stressed on a digitalised credit information bureau. A bank asks for information about an entrepreneur when he applies for loan. If the applicant is a defaulter, he is considered ineligible for new loan. Loan approval is delayed as the bureau doe not have updated information, Sattar explained to reporters. The Bangladesh Bank boss advised the banks executives to help foster economic growth and stability, create new jobs, expand farm loans, cut poverty and rural development. He also directed them to reduce lending rates and spread as much as possible and banking charges, fees and commission to an acceptable level. Rahman asked the executives to boost defaulted loan recovery, increase remittance inflow and prevent money laundering. A roadmap will be prepared on these issues through more meetings with the bank executives. The economy will see positive outcome if the banking sector is conducted in line with the roadmap, Rahman said. bdn
