<TITLE> Myanmar's Suu Kyi recovering from illness: party </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 YANGON, Tue May 12, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Detained Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi is responding well to treatment for low blood pressure and dehydration but needs further medical checks, a spokesman for her party said on Tuesday. Nyan Win of the National League for Democracy (NLD) said a doctor had been allowed to see the Nobel laureate for four hours on Monday at her Yangon home, where she is under house arrest. "Daw Suu has recovered and improved, but she was suffering muscle cramps," Nyan Win said after speaking with Suu Kyi's assistant doctor, Pyone Mo Ei.

U.N. legal experts have said the 63-year-old Suu Kyi's confinement is illegal under Myanmar law, which allows for a detention of five consecutive years before the accused must be freed or put on trial. Analysts say it is unlikely the military, which has ruled the former Burma for more than four decades and rejected the NLD's 1990 election victory, would release her any time soon. The generals have vowed to press ahead with a seven-step "roadmap to democracy", which is expected to culminate in multi-party elections in 2010. The NLD and Western governments dismiss the "roadmap" and last year's army-drafted constitution as a cover for the generals to cement their grip on p
