<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 12 (bdnews24.com)A Rajshahi court Tuesday sent Nadim Mostafa, a former BNP MP who was convicted of graft and accused of abetting militants, to jail on surrender. "As my client turned himself in at 11:45 am, the court sent him to jail," Nadim's lawyer AKM Fakhrul Islam said. Mosammat Lutfa Begum, additional district and sessions judge, sent Mostafa to prison. The High Court on May 3 ordered the fugitive "VIP convicts" to surrender in trial courts within two weeks. A two-member High Court bench on Feb 23 delivered a split judgment on the appeals for bail and withdrawal of cases against convicted fugitives. The senior member of the bench, Justice Syed AB Mahmudul Haq, and the other member, Justice Mainul Islam Chowdhury, differed when the senior judge had ordered that the VIPs, upon surrender to trial court within eight weeks, would not have to go to jail. In that case, Justice Haq ruled, hearing on their appeal pending in the High Court will be held after execution of vokalatnamas by these convicts from the trial court. Justice Chowdhury, rejecting their appeal, ordered the VIPs to surrender to trial court, and accordingly they can appeal against the trial court verdict from jail as per applicable law. The bench had then sent the case briefs to the Chief Justice for necessary orders. The CJ gave the responsibility of disposing of the matter over to a third bench headed by Justice Md Iman Ali. The third HC bench Sunday disposed of the appeals filed for bail and cancellation of their cases of the several such convicts. They were: former communication minister Anwar Hossain Monju, Awami League leaders Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya, Alhaj Moqbul Hossain, Haji Selim and Md Mohiuddin, BNP leaders Nadim Mostafa, Abu Hanif Patwari, Md Babul Chowdhury, Saria Chowdhury, Mafruza Sultana, Masudur Rahman and Safiur Rahman Babu. bdn
