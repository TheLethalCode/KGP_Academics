<TITLE> US likely to feel pressure to move on Intel </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Wed May 13, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Now that European, South Korean and Japanese authorities have moved against chip giant Intel Corp for breaking antitrust laws, the question is: Are US officials feeling pressure to take some action, too? The European Commission fined Intel 1.06 billion euros ($1.45 billion) on Wednesday for abusing its dominant market position and ordered the US company to change its practices. "The size of the fine shows that there's been substantial harm to consumers," said David Balto, a former antitrust policy director for the US Federal Trade Commission. "That's going to compel the FTC to act." Intel is under investigation by both the FTC, which made its probe formal in June 2008, and the New York attorney general's office. The FTC rarely fines companies for antitrust infractions, but has ordered them to end anti-competitive practices. The EU said Intel had paid computer makers to postpone or cancel plans to launch products that used Advanced Micro Devices chips; provided illegal, secret rebates so computer manufacturers would use mostly or entirely Intel chips; and paid a major retailer to stock only computers with its chips. The EU ordered Intel to "cease the illegal practices immediately to the extent that they are still ongoing." Speaking before the ruling was released but after elements of it were reported, John Briggs, an antitrust expert with law firm Axinn, Veltrop and Harkrider, LLP, said he expected more legal trouble for Intel. "This kind of a ruling is going to motivate a lot of bees to go after a lot of pollen and honey," Briggs said. "There are a lot of people who will be wanting a piece of Intel." The size of the fine will matter to the FTC, said Bert Foer, president of the American Antitrust Institute. "That will put pressure on the FTC," he said. The commission might pursue Intel under Section 5 of the FTC Act, which forbids unfair methods of competition, rather than under antitrust law proper, said Michael Salinger, former director of the agency's Bureau of Economics. "A number of current commissioners are interested in expanding the scope of Section 5," Salinger said. "What's likely to occur with the FTC, is that they will use the Intel case to explore the reach of the FTC Act." Intel reached a settlement in 1999 in a previous FTC investigation. The FTC declined to comment for this story. BIG CHANGES FOR A TOUGH COMPETITOR? Smaller rival AMD has long accused Intel of abusing its dominance of the $280 billion chip market and filed its own lawsuit in 2005, but that case has not yet gone to trial. Japan's trade commission concluded in 2005 that Intel violated the country's anti-monopoly act. And in June 2008, South Korea fined Intel some $26 million, finding it offered rebates to PC makers in return for not buying AMD microprocessors. Intel, whose microprocessors power more than 80 percent of the world's PCs, has said from the beginning that it was guilty of nothing more than being a tough competitor. The company denied any wrongdoing on Wednesday and said it planned to appeal at Europe's Court of First Instance. But antitrust expert Briggs said there were big changes ahead for Intel. "It's going to be a rough day for Intel and its shareholders," he said. "They're going to have to pay a fine and will have to change their conduct in Europe." Ed Black, head of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, predicted trouble at home for Intel. "The evidence has been compelling to all those who so far reviewed it," he said. "Cutting-edge, high-tech industries will lead us out of the current recession and serve as the engine driving future economic growth -- if they're not squashed by unfair, illegal business practi
