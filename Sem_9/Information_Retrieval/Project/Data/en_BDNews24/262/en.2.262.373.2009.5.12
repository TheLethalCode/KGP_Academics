 Jamalpur, May 12 (bdnews24.com)  The law secretary, the Jamalpur deputy commissioner and two others were sued Monday on charges of breaching rules in recruiting Government Pleader. GP Delwar Hossain charged DC Kamal Krishna Bhattachariya, the law secretary, the law ministry solicitor and the newly-appointed GP Abdur Rashid. Senior assistant judge Zillur Rahman took the case into cognisance and ordered the accused to explain within three days. According to the law ministry rules, a lawyer with at least 10 years of experience and less than 60 years old is eligible to become a GP. But the DC, Hossain alleged, breached the rule by recommending the 70-year-old Abdur Rashid. bdnews
