<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 13 (bdnews24.com)  The national cricket team made a frustrating start in the first of three Twenty20 warm-up matches ahead of next month's ICC T20 World Cup in England as they suffered a six-run defeat against the Bangladesh A team in a low-scoring encounter on Wednesday. The senior team, chasing 129-6 laid by the opponents, were restricted to 123-7 in the stipulated 20 overs at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Opener Tamim Iqbal and Junaed Siddique got off to a flying start adding 39 runs in 4.5 overs before Mahmudullah dismissed Tamim for 17 to trigger a collapse in the top order. New faces Mohammad Mithun (1) and Samsur Rahman (8) could not justify their inclusion and Junaed fell to Arafat Sunny for 33 off 27 balls studded with three fours and one six, leaving the side wobbling at 79-4 in 13 overs. However, Rakibul Hasan and Nayeem Islam chipped in with 29 and 15 to take the national team almost to the target. Earlier, Bangladesh A side put in to bat, made a modest total with national discards Nafis Iqbal and Mahmuduallh Raid striking 35 and 34 runs respectively. Later, rain halted proceedings of the second match after the first innings of the national team, who posted a modest 133-9 in the stipulated 20 overs riding on a fifty by Tamim Iqbal. Tamim top-scored with 66 off 52 balls studded with eight fours while Nayeem Islam played run-a-ball 20 with the help of two boundaries, but no other batsman could reach double figures in the game. bd
