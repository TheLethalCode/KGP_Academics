 Karachi, May 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani stocks extended gains on Wednesday after the peaceful passing of an anniversary of violence in Karachi and as investors took heart from a government offensive against the Taliban, dealers said. The Karachi Stock Exchange's benchmark 100-share index, which gained 2.44 percent on Tuesday, was up 1.28 percent, or 93.45 points at 7,390.35 by 0505 GMT on turnover of 76.5 million shares. "There is a feeling among investors that the government is now committed to tackle the militants in Swat, which is good for sentiment," said Sajid Bhanji, a dealer at brokers Arif Habib Ltd. "Another positive for the market is that no violence was reported in Karachi yesterday. Many people were expecting trouble and they are now relieved," he said. Karachi, the capital of Sindh province, was shut down on Tuesday on the second anniversary of bloody clashes between ethnic-based factions that killed nearly 40 people and wounded about 150. The provincial government had announced a public holiday and a day of mourning amid fear of violence after at least 27 people were killed clashes between factions last month. While stock investors are getting used to deteriorating security in the northwest, violence in Karachi has a more immediate market impact.
