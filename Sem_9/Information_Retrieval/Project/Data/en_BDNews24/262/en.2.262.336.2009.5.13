<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 13 (bdnews24.com)The state minister for home, Tanjim Ahmed, has said the BNP-led coalition government created a culture of killing in custody based on a "politically-motivated hit list" and that those involved will be punished. "Following the confession of the arrested criminals, they would be taken to a place where they were killed," Tanjim Ahmed told reporters Wednesday after a top-level meeting on law and order. "If necessary, we'll investigate and punish those responsible for the deaths in custody." Replying to a question, the minister said, "(Normal) death in the safe custody of law-enforcers and (deliberate) killing on the pretext that there was an encounter are two different things." "This government will not allow extra-judicial killing. There will be no deaths in custody during the tenure of this government. "We'll never let that happen." But the minister, replying to questions, agreed the law-enforcers would have the right to defend themselves when under attack. "If the law-enforcing personnel in their fight against armed terrorists do not have the right to self-defence, it will be a violation of their human rights." But the crime-fighting will never aim to serve anyone's political interests. "We'll not prepare any list as the BNP-Jamaat government did. "The law-enforcing authorities will prepare the list of criminals and terrorists, and they will do whatever is necessary." Tanjim renewed his zero tolerance pledge to deal with terrorism and militancy. "Terrorists belonging to any party will not be let off. None is above law." Senior police officers from Dhaka and adjacent areas joined the state minister for a meeting lasting one and a half hours from 3pm. bd
