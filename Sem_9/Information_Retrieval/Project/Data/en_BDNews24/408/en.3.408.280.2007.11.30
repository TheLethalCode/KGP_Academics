 BRUSSELS, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Commission will launch a new bid next week to prise open one of the last business domains still resistant to EU rules on cross-border competition -- the bloc's jealously guarded defence market. All past efforts by the EU executive to apply legislation to the 35-billion-euro ($52 billion) market have been thwarted by EU capitals shielding national industries they see as vital to domestic security and jobs. EU officials behind proposals due to be unveiled on Tuesday believe governments are listening to their argument that more value can be squeezed out of stagnant defence budgets if they open tenders to more cross-border competition. Yet they acknowledge the risk that the plan could still be shot down, and will present the legislation as a bid to inject a dose of competition into the market while recognising that the defence sector must still be treated specially. "Obviously the market for tanks is different to the market for washing machines. There is an element of national security that must be taken into account," said one EU defence source. According to EU sources familiar with the plans, EU Internal Market Commissioner Charlie McCreevy will announce two draft directives -- one on procurement and one covering cross-border transfers of military goods between companies or governments. In broad terms, the moves will seek to encourage defence customers to look more beyond national markets, while paving the way for legal action in cases of abuse of single-market rules. "This is not an overnight solution," said a second source, acknowledging that even if the legislation sees the light of day, it could take years to transform procurement patterns. HELICOPTERS TO WINE GLASSES The procurement market covers everything from contracts for attack helicopters to wine glasses for officers' messes and in theory is subject to standard EU single-market rules. Yet in reality, governments make wide use of EU treaty Article 296 allowing them to shield contracts from open tender and deal exclusively with domestic suppliers by citing national security concerns. EU officials estimate that the Article 296 provision is invoked for around half of the market by value, frequently for run-of-the-mill contracts with no national security impact. Twenty-four of the bloc's 27 member states have since last year signed up to a "code of conduct" undertaking to open up tenders for sensitive equipment to non-domestic suppliers -- but the code is purely voluntary and non-binding. In a bid to chip away at improper use of Article 296, the Commission will propose that customers be allowed to seek commitments from suppliers that they will deliver any equipment come what may, for example even if they are taken over. The executive believes this proposal should address the "security of supply" concern commonly cited by governments as grounds invoking national security interests and awarding a contract to a domestic company without an open tender. In a second move aimed at reducing recourse to Article 296, the Commission will allow customers to require commitments from suppliers that any classified information made available during the process of awarding a contract remains secure. A third step will allow defence customers to opt for a tender procedure which will allow them to approach suppliers of choice and negotiate terms of a contract with them rather than the standard way of throwing it open to all-comers. "That is recognition of the complexity of awarding contracts for things like tanks," said one defence source. Such proposals are attempts to entice defence clients into making more cross-border tenders. But if accepted, they would be backed up by the threat of the Commission taking up its right to demand fines or other sanctions against those abusing the rul
