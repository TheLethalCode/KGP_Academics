 HARARE, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Robert Mugabe's government said on Thursday it hoped Zimbabwe's problems would not feature at an EU-Africa summit in Lisbon next month, but warned it was ready to confront its critics. Mugabe, accused by the West of widespread human rights violations but regarded in Africa as an independence hero, got an invitation to the Dec. 8-9 summit after previous efforts to convene the meeting floundered on whether he should participate. "In the event that any participant tries to attack Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe is more than capable of defending itself. Zimbabwe has an excellent case to present ... and that will be a wonderful opportunity," Foreign Minister Simbarashe Mumbengegwi said. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown is boycotting the summit over Mugabe's presence, saying nothing will be gained from dialogue between Britain and Mugabe whom he said must "take full responsibility" for the collapse of Zimbabwe's economy. Speaking to journalists on Thursday after a meeting with African diplomats accredited to Harare, Mumbengegwi said Mugabe had been invited because a majority of EU members realised Zimbabwe had no problems with the union but rather former coloniser Britain. "It has now been realised that the relationship between the two regions cannot be held ransom by a dispute of a bilateral nature between two of their members," he said. "It is hoped that when the two regions meet they focus on matters between the two regions, not a bilateral dispute between two countries." Mumbengegwi charged that Zimbabwe was a victim of a racist hate campaign triggered by Mugabe's seizure of white-owned farms for redistribution to blacks without compensation, after Britain refused to pay for the land. "The dispute between the UK and Zimbabwe is purely bilateral, arising from the colonisation of Zimbabwe by the UK and its refusal to honour obligations," he said. The Zimbabwean minister said Africa had taken a principled stand over Mugabe's participation because the EU had no right to decide on questions of political leadership on the continent. "The two regions meet as equal partners and the summit will take place in a spirit and atmosphere of sovereign equality." Analysts say the EU is determined this year's summit should take place, partly to solidify its position as Africa's largest trading partner in the face of rising competition from China. Zimbabwe is struggling with the world's highest inflation rate of about 8,000 percent, chronic shortages of food, fuel and foreign currency, soaring poverty and unemployment of about 80 percent. Mugabe, in power since independence in 1980, blames the economic crisis on sabotage by political opponents trying to end his rule.
