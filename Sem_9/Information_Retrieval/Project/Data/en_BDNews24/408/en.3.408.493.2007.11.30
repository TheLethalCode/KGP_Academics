<TITLE> EU Commission to go softly while treaty ratified </TITLE>

 BRUSSELS, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Commission will tread softly in legal action against member states and may delay sensitive policy proposals to avoid complicating ratification of the European Union's new reform treaty, senior EU officials say. Several senior sources said Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso aimed to avoid a rerun of 2005, when outcry in France over a plan by Brussels to throw open the market for services such as plumbers to cross-border competition helped doom a referendum on the draft EU constitution. There is no written instruction, but the officials said word had been passed from Barroso's office and the Commission's secretary-general, Catherine Day, to ease up on so-called infringement proceedings over breaches of EU rules. "We've been told to be very careful with infringement proceedings in the first half of next year. You won't be seeing a lot of them," one of the EU executive's top civil servants said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "Barroso is determined to learn the lessons of 2005 and make sure we keep a low profile." The Commission officially denied on Friday ordering any pause in the actions, which can lead to national governments being taken to the European Court of Justice and ultimately fined if they fail to conform with EU legislation. "As a matter of principle, The Commission does not pursue pointless infringements ... The Commission does not hound member states. Community law does exist and must apply," chief Commission spokesman Johannes Laitenberger told a news briefing. "MORE REALISTIC" But he said the EU executive had discussed "a more realistic procedure for dealing with infringements" and agreed to test the idea of dealing with such cases monthly instead of issuing huge barrages of legal action four times a year. Another Commission spokesman said Brussels considered the whole agenda, including the electoral calendar, when deciding on infringement proceedings, and tried to work with member states. "The secretary-general always looks at forthcoming events." Only Ireland is certain to hold a referendum on the EU reform treaty, which will introduce all the main institutional changes foreseen in the defunct constitution minus the symbols. EU diplomats said Barroso had asked Taxation Commissioner Laszlo Kovacs to hold back proposals for a common corporate tax base until after the Irish vote. Dublin has used its low corporate tax rate to attract foreign investment and business leaders are fiercely opposed to the EU proposals. France and the Netherlands, which both voted against the constitution, have decided to ratify the treaty in parliament, as has Britain, which had promised voters a final say. The Irish public are due to vote on the matter early next year, while several key member states, including France and Britain, are also planning their parliamentary ratification procedure in the first half of 2008. EU officials said politically sensitive proposals that had been delayed for further consideration include planned legislation to liberalise the market in health services and a revision of the EU's anti-dumping trade instruments. Both involve debate about the economic changes wrought by globalisation -- preserving public health services versus introducing private sector competition, and protecting firms that manufacture in Europe against companies, many of them European, that make goods in low-cost emerging natio
