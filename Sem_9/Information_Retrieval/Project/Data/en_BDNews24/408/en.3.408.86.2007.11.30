<TEXT>
 BRUSSELS, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spain gave its backing to the industrial plan for the European Union's satellite navigation system on Friday, diplomats said, establishing full EU support for the multi-billion-euro Galileo project. Twenty-six of the bloc's 27 member states backed a proposal late on Thursday that laid out how the work for the 30-satellite system would be distributed, but Spain opposed the plan while seeking assurances that it could house a ground control centre.
