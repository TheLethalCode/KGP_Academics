 ADDIS ABABA, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ethiopia's Prime Minister Meles Zenawi has denied accusations from rebels of massive rights abuses by troops including hanging and rape during this year's offensive against the Ogaden separatist movement. "I am absolutely confident that there have been no widespread human rights violations in the Ogaden, not only because we believe in the respect for human rights, but because we know how to fight the insurgency," he told reporters. Although overshadowed by other conflicts in the wider region, including Somalia and Sudan's Darfur, fighting in the Ogaden has increased this year as the government responded to a major rebel attack on a Chinese-run oil exploration field. Both sides say they have killed hundreds of the others' fighters, but no independent verification has been possible in the remote and arid southeastern area near the Somalia border. The Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF) says Ethiopian soldiers have been persecuting and killing locals, as well as blocking food and burning villages, in tactics intended to flush out rebels and their sympathisers. "Armed forces ... captured by the ONLF in recent months have reported on several occasions that they were under direct orders to hang villagers in 'trouble spots' throughout Ogaden as part of a continuing collective punishment campaign against civilians," an ONLF statement said on Thursday. "This brutal practice is increasingly becoming the terror tactic of choice for ... regime troops in the Ogaden and is well known to our nomadic population." Increasingly under pressure from the West over his rights record in recent years, Meles says the ONLF is lying, and is a terrorist group sponsored by arch-enemy Eritrea. "Massive human rights abuses and massive deaths in the Ogaden do not and will not exist," he said. Once a rebel leader himself, who helped topple former Ethiopian leader Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991, Meles said it would be counterproductive to terrorise locals. "After all, it is only 16 or so years ago that we ourselves were insurgents," he said. "The stupidest mistake a government does is to harass civilians." Meles generally gets high marks from Western diplomats for his anti-poverty strategies, but is frequently criticised for authoritarian tactics handling foes inside Ethiopia. After visiting the Ogaden this week, U.N. humanitarian chief John Holmes called for investigations into rights abuse accusations in carefully-chosen words. He also said that action was needed to prevent a major humanitarian crisis there.
