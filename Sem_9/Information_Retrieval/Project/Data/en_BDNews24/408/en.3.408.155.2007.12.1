<TITLE> Spain policeman killed in ETA raid in France: report </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Madrid, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Spanish guardia civil policeman was shot and killed in France during an operation against guerrillas of the Basque separatist group ETA, Cadena Ser radio station reported on Saturday. If confirmed, it would be the first killing by ETA since it called off a 15-month-old ceasefire on June 5 -- which it had effectively already broken by bombing Madrid airport last December. A Guardia Civil spokeswoman said she could neither confirm nor deny the report. Neither French police nor Spain's interior ministry were immediately available for comment. No further details were immediately available. The armed separatists have killed more than 800 people in four decades of armed struggle for independence for ancient Basque territories in northern Spain and southern France. Polls show most inhabitants of Spain's Basque Country, which already enjoys considerable autonomy, do not want full separation from Spain.
