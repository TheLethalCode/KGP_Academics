 Dhaka, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com)  The interim government has scrapped Nov 7 as public holiday from next year. A meeting of the Council of Advisers chaired by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed made the decision Wednesday night. The BNP and many of its allies observe Nov 7 as the "National Revolution and Solidarity Day". The day has been observed as public holiday since 1976 but the practice was halted by the Awami League government in 1996. Later, the day was reestablished as public holiday in 2001 when the BNP-led four-party coalition government came to power. This year's Nov 7 was also observed as public holiday. bdnewe
