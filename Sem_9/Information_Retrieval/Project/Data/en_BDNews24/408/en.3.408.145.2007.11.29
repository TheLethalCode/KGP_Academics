 TOKYO, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - About a hundred Japanese prosecutors filed into the vast Defence Ministry complex in central Tokyo on Thursday, in search of evidence in a bribery case involving the ministry's former top official. Takemasa Moriya was arrested the previous day after he admitted he had been treated to hundreds of expensive golf trips and other forms of entertainment by defence contractor Motonobu Miyazaki. Moriya's wife, Sachiko, who was present on many of the trips, was also arrested. "We'll fully cooperate with the investigation, Vice Defence Minister Kohei Masuda told a news conference. "Even if the search could affect our daily work, we have to accept it." The case has threatened to affect Finance Minister Fukushiro Nukaga, after Moriya testified under oath in parliament this month that he believed Nukaga had been present at a dinner party he attended with Miyazaki at an exclusive Tokyo restaurant. The main opposition Democratic Party called for Nukaga to answer questions in parliament on the issue. But a former Pentagon official who was present at the dinner said on Thursday that Nukaga was not there. "I have met Mr. Nukaga several times because he was a former defence minister," James Auer, now a professor at Vanderbilt University in the United States, told a news conference at the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's headquarters. "I met him at his office in the Diet (parliament) and also at his office at the defence ministry when he was defence minister. However, to the best of my knowledge, I have never had dinner or lunch or breakfast with Mr. Nukaga." Miyazaki was a top executive with Yamada Corp, until this year the sales agent in Japan for General Electric, but later left to set up his own firm. General Electric switched its contract to Miyazaki's new company, Nihon Mirise, in July, media reports say, but has since suspended business with both firms. Miyazaki has also been arrested for suspected embezzlement and bribery.
