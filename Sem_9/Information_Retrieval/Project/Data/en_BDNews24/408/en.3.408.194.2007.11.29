<TITLE> BNP will change constitution in council: Hafiz </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com)  The BNP will soon convene a party council to amend its constitution and apply to the Election Commission for registration well before the deadline, BNP acting secretary general Hafizuddin Ahmed said Thursday. "It's not because the chief election commissioner said so or for the satisfaction of any quarter; we'd like to amend and reform the party constitution as we realise the need to do so," Hafiz told reporters at his Banani home. "Our chairperson Khaleda Zia also holds the same opinion. We'll change the undemocratic elements of the constitution and make necessary reforms through the forthcoming council session," he said. Khandakar Delwar Hossain, the Khaleda-appointed secretary general of the opposing BNP faction, had Wednesday described as 'unnecessary interference" chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda's comment that many parties needed to change constitutions. "It's not the chief election commissioner's responsibility to define or suggest changes to be made by parties to their constitution. It will now be a difficult task for the Election Commission to convince people about their good intentions of holding a free and fair election," Delwar said. Huda during electoral reforms dialogue with Workers Party Tuesday said many political parties including BNP would needed to change their constitutions to get registered with the Election Commission. He said political parties not promoting democratic practices in their constitutions would not be allowed to register with the commission. "A number of political parties will have to change their constitutions, otherwise they won't be considered fit for registration." "I've read the party constitution of the BNP. I'm afraid they'll have to change theirs too," the top polls official said. Hafiz said even before chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda's remarks, former secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan had proposed reforms to ensure democratic practices in the party. He said he fully endorsed Huda's comment that many "talk a lot about democracy but do not practice democracy in their own party". The acting secretary general reiterated: "We have been proposing reforms for a long time now. We've been clamouring for changes even before the CEC pronounced them two days back." He, however, admitted that there had been no council session in the 14 preceding years because the party constitution had not been complied with. Even the national executive committee had failed to meet annually to review crucial matters, he added Blaming the BNP top brasses, Hafiz admitted: "I, too, am not exempted from such charges." On recent statements by the Delwar-led faction, he said: "What they are saying about provisions of an acting chairperson or an acting secretary general not being there in the party constitution is untrue." "Mirza Golam Hafiz acted as chairperson in the absence of Khaleda Zia in 1987. As our chairperson has been detained for some time now, the senior-most leader has taken up the responsibility of running business as usual. There's nothing odd about that." Hafiz cited other instances where senior leaders had also temporarily assumed the secretary general's office. Asked about the government cancelling the public holiday on Nov 7 that the BNP observed as National Revolution and Solidarity Day, he said: "The day is important in our national life and we'd request the government to review the decision." He said eight BNP teams had distributed relief in the southern districts and another team started for Mathbaria Thursday with relief materials including medicine worth Tk 6 lakh. bdnews24
