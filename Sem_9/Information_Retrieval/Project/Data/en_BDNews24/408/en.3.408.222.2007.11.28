 KOLKATA, India, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik is doubtful for the second test against India starting on Friday after failing to recover from an ankle injury sustained while playing soccer. Malik twisted his left ankle during a soccer game after his side's six-wicket defeat in the first test in New Delhi on Monday. After a scan on Monday the Pakistan management were optmistic that Malik would play but his ankle was still heavily strapped on Wednesday and he did not take part in practice. "He's nursing an ankle injury. It will take time," Pakistan manager Talat Ali told reporters. "He'll have a fitness test tomorrow." Ali said Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar, who took six wickets in the first test, was recovering from a viral infection. Akhtar stayed in hospital overnight after complaining of fatigue caused by fever. "He has recovered very well," Ali said. "Hopefully he will be at practice tomorrow." Fast bowler Umar Gul has also recovered from the back injury that forced him out of the first test. Security has been increased after police said they had received an e-mail from a little-known Islamic outfit threatening to disrupt the game
