<TITLE> China warns Japan over Taiwan activists </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Beijing, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China's Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi on Saturday urged his Japanese counterpart Masahiko Komura not to provide a forum for Taiwan's independence activists, a Japanese official said. In a bilateral meeting in Beijing, Yang said he saw Taiwan's plans for a referendum next March on whether to seek to join the United Nations as a threat, the official said. Yang urged that Japan not provide a forum for independence activists, nor send any "wrong messages". Komura said Japan could not support any one-sided attempt to change the current balance of power between Taiwan and China, the official said. Japan occasionally plays host to politicians from Taiwan, seen by China as a renegade province. Presidential hopeful Ma Ying-jeou paid a goodwill visit in November, while rival Frank Hsieh plans a similar trip this month, Kyodo news agency said. Yang and Komura were meeting ahead of a high-level economic dialogue involving six Japanese cabinet ministers and eight senior Chinese officials.
