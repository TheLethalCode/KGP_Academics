<TITLE> Pakistan's Musharraf starts 2nd term facing sea of woes </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ISLAMABAD, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's Pervez Musharraf began his second term as president on Thursday, facing widespread resentment at home, pressure from Western allies to tackle Islamist militancy and a difficult shift to life as a civilian. Musharraf was sworn in a day after quitting as chief of the army, which brought him to power in a military coup in 1999. He proffered an olive branch to old political rivals outraged by his declaration of emergency rule on Nov. 3, welcoming their return from exile as good for reconciliation. But in a sign of the anger he faces, lawyers chanting "Go, Musharraf, Go!" clashed with police in the eastern city of Lahore. Eleven lawyers and three policemen were injured. Musharraf's grip on power in nuclear-armed Pakistan will be less tight now he is out of uniform. He enters rocky political waters after a parliamentary election on Jan. 8 likely to install a legislature hostile enough to contemplate impeachment. The 64-year-old leader said the country would be stronger with him as a civilian leader and his hand-picked successor, General Ashfaq Kayani, in charge of the military. "This is a milestone in the transition of Pakistan to a complete essence of democracy," he said in his inauguration speech. Washington sees stability in Pakistan as vital to its campaign against al Qaeda and the fight against the Taliban in neighbouring Afghanistan. Pakistani army action against militants has sparked a suicide bombing campaign that has killed more than 400 people since July. EXILES RETURN Musharraf said he welcomed the return from exile of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif on Sunday as well as that of another old rival, Benazir Bhutto, last month. Musharraf deposed Sharif in 1999 and forced him abroad a year later "I personally feel this is good for the political reconciliation I have spoken of," Musharraf said. Sharif and Bhutto, also a former prime minister, say they may boycott the January polls, arguing the vote will not be free and fair if held under emergency powers. Most analysts expect them to take part, though Sharif's candidacy faces legal challenges. Musharraf, due to address the nation later on Thursday, made no mention of lifting the state of emergency. U.S. President George W. Bush on Wednesday urged him to end emergency rule before the elections. Musharraf won re-election in a vote by legislators on Oct. 6. He later suspended the constitution, declared emergency rule and purged the Supreme Court to block opposition legal challenges to his victory while still a serving officer. Sharif told reporters on Wednesday Musharraf's oath of office had no legitimacy and he demanded the reinstatement of judges sacked under the emergency. In Lahore, about 250 lawyers in black suits tried to push their way past police who fought them back with batons outside the city's main court. Both sides hurled bricks at each other. "We don't accept Musharraf even without his uniform. He has to go," said lawyer Malik Mohammad Arshad, his eye swollen and head bleeding after begin hit by a brick. Lawyers have led widespread opposition to Musharraf since he tried to dismiss the chief justice in March. Musharraf, who cited rising militancy when he imposed the emergency, said the military had "broken the back of the spread of terrorism" from remote tribal lands on the Afghan border towards urban population centres. "We have to defeat terrorism, there is no choice," he said, hours after five soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb near the Afghan border. As a military band struck up the national anthem, Musharraf snapped to salute before quickly lowering his arm, apparently remembering he was now a civilian. Many ordinary Pakistanis say it is time he left politics. "I don't consider him to be the president. After taking oath as president eight years ago, what has he done? Nothing," said Ali Imran, a 30-year-old government servant in Lahore. "What we want is a democracy like India." Pakistani stock investors, happy to see Musharraf sworn in and hopeful the emergency would soon be lifted, pushed the main index 0.58 percent higher. Investors like Musharraf's liberal policies that have brought strong growth, dealers said.

South African Kirsten was interviewed for the job on Monday and a decision is expected later this week when senior board officials meet. Board secretary Niranjan Shah told Reuters on Tuesday that Kirsten's appointment was "more or less finalised". "His skills as a player, as a player in a team which was successful, can help the team," Kumble told reporters." "At this point in time, having played against Gary, he was a very tough competitor and he was in a team which was successful in the late 90s, probably one of the top teams in world cricket." Kirsten, 40, a left-handed opening batsman, played 101 tests and 185 one-day internationals for South Africa in an 11-year career that ended in 2004. Kumble, who has played against the South African, was present when Kirsten met with the board's coach committee which includes three former captains Sunil Gavaskar, Ravi Shastri and Srinivas Venkataraghavan. India have been without a coach since Australian Chappell resigned after their first-round exit at the World Cup in March and the team have had interim cricket managers since the tour of Bangladesh in May. Another South African Graham Ford turned down the coach's job in June.

Reinforcing strong growth in India, the world's fastest-growing major economy after China, was now an integral part of maintaining global economic demand, he said on Thursday. "I think along with the Doha world trade talks, our FTA potentially has a very important role not just in boosting our economies but also the global economy as a whole," Mandelson told businessmen at an India-EU business summit. "An FTA will significantly increase Indian exports to the European Union, and EU imports and investment in my view have a valuable role in stimulating further the Indian economy." "Spurring Indian economic growth, poverty reduction, is of course very good for India, but it would also take up the slack if, as is widely expected, other parts of the global economy begin to slow." India's economy grew 9.4 percent in the fiscal year ending March 2007, its strongest pace in 18 years. Growth has averaged 8.6 percent over the past four years and policymakers expect about 9.0 percent this fiscal year. Mandelson said the EU was fully prepared to address issues of non-tariff barriers and intellectual property rights as it negotiates the India deal. Indian Trade Minister Kamal Nath restated his position that India wanted to seal a pact by the end of 2008. Mandelson gave little away in terms of a timetable. "The substance of this FTA is more important than the timing," he said. Nath added that India was looking for 90 percent of the items it trades with the EU to be included in the agreement, and said he expects the Europeans to place 95 percent of their tradeable items on the agenda. Indian and EU leaders will meet on Friday in an attempt to push forward the proposed free trade deal. The EU is increasingly drawing up a web of free trade pacts in Asia after the United States and Japan made inroads to tap into the high growth potential of these economies. European trade officials want to deepen discussions on sensitive areas with India, such as removing barriers to trade in services, intellectual property protection and public procurement. The EU is India's largest trading partner, accounting for a fifth of India's total trade, and is also one of its most important sources of foreign investment. "Growth in emerging economies will be a major driver for global economic demand and for maintaining a healthy global economy," Mandelson told businessmen. "It is a mark of India's growing weight alongside China that we look increasingly ... (for it) to play its role in the global economy."

Dutt, sporting a beard and closely cropped hair, walked free following more than a month in jail, and after being granted bail by the Supreme Court on Tuesday while his lawyers challenge the conviction. Wearing a white crumpled shirt and a streak of vermilion on his forehead, Dutt waved to the crowds outside the jail in the city of Pune before quickly getting into a waiting car. He carried a yellow bag containing his belongings. The actor was convicted for taking an AK-56 rifle and a pistol from gangsters linked to the bombings in which 257 people were killed in the financial capital, Mumbai, in 1993. Dutt had challenged the conviction last month and sought bail until the petition was heard. He is expected to be out of jail for a while as the appeal could take months to be heard and ruled on by a judicial system burdened by millions of cases. His lawyers say it could take at least two years for the case to be taken up by the Supreme Court. Dutt flew in a private plane from Pune to Mumbai where he was received by hundreds of shrieking fans and smiling family members. Sweets were distributed to passersby and reporters gathered outside his home. Fans gave him bouquets of red roses and burst firecrackers. "I want to thank family, my fans and the people of my country," Dutt told reporters. "I have full faith in the judiciary, I know that justice will be delivered." Dutt, 48, was among 100 people found guilty by a special Mumbai court, which sentenced 12 of them to death and varied jail terms and fines to the rest. Dutt's appeal says his conviction by a special anti-terrorism court was based on a confession he later retracted. It said the confession was obtained under duress. He has said he acquired the weapons to protect his family during communal riots in 1993. Dutt's friends and Bollywood producers said he would soon resume acting in films held up while he was in jail. About $12 million ride on Dutt in three films under production now. "For the time being at least, he is not inside ... he can focus on his career right now," said his friend Ajay Marwah.

The Dalai Lama has been considering options for choosing his successor, saying that senior lamas could follow Vatican practice and elect one of their number to succeed him, or that Tibetans might want to do away with the institution altogether. He has also mooted a referendum. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said that while China respected religious freedom, it could not accept the Dalai Lama's referendum idea. "The Chinese government has a policy of religious freedom and respects Tibetan Buddhism's religious rituals and historic conventions," Liu told a regular news conference. "The Dalai Lama's related actions clearly violate established religious rituals and historic conventions and therefore cannot be accepted," he said, without elaborating. Traditionally, a Dalai Lama's death provokes a search for his reincarnation among children born in Tibet at the same time. Many Tibetans fear the death of the current Dalai Lama, now 72, would be a major setback in their fight for more autonomy within China or independence, creating a leadership vacuum that Beijing could be expected to exploit. In hopes of circumventing this, the Dalai Lama has long suggested that his reincarnation be sought outside China. More controversially, he also suggested in Japan this month that his successor could be chosen before his death. China has ruled remote, mountainous Tibet with an iron hand since Communist troops marched in there in 1950, and Tibetans have chafed under the yoke ever since. Tibetan monks rioted last week after an altercation between them and a Han Chinese shopkeeper. It was the most recent of a string of incidents in Tibet, where tensions between Chinese and Tibetans remain high. Liu said that while he had no more details on the incident, the general situation in Tibet was stable and its economy was developing well. "Anyone who tries to disrupt Tibet's stability and development will not have the support of the people and will not succeed," he added.
