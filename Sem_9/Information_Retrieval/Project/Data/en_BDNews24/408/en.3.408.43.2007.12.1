<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com)  Election workers Saturday started photographing and fingerprinting voters for national ID card project at 140 polling centres under the jurisdiction of 16 Dhaka City Corporation (DCC) police stations. President Iajuddin Ahmed and his wife Anwara Begum were registered at the Bangabhaban Government Primary School registration centre in the presence of chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda and DCC mayor Sadeque Hossain Khoka, a Bangabhaban press statement. Voters had their pictures and finger prints taken at Nurjahan Memorial High School centre at Adabar Pisciculture Road. Allegations of inconsistency and irregularity in voter registration work, however, galore. Shah Alam, a local voter, complained, "No data collector visited houses No1 through No 20 at Road 10, Shekhertek. We have repeatedly told the thana election officer Anisur Rahman about it, but to no avail." District election officer Faisal Kader Khan said, "We will look into the issue. We are also working to fill up exempted voters' forms. We are working from morning to evening." Voters will be handed their national ID cards later. How long the work will take depends on the total number of voters, Faisal added. Faisal said the data entry server for Dhanmondi, Mohammadpur, Shyamoli and Adabar had been set up at Mohammadpur Physical Exercise College. The army was aiding poll roll registration work at Encyclopedia International School at Nabodoy Housing Society in Mohammadpur. The police was also present there. Some centres were crowded while others were relatively empty. Election commissioner Muhammad Sohul Hossain spoke to reporters about the difference in the number of voters at different centres. "I have heard of the matter. Data collectors have asked voters to come to registration centres on specific dates after giving them a slip. "But many voters were not able to keep the appointments. Perhaps that is why there is a rush at some centres on some days. Many omitted voters are being registered directly at registration centres. This could also be a reason." Deputy election commissioner Biswas Lutfar Rahman told bdnews24.com that work had started on Saturday in Airport, Uttara, Pallabi, Mirpur, Kafrul, Cantonment, Khilkhet, Khilgaon, Tejgaon industrial area, Sobujbagh, Motijheel, Adabar, Mohammadpur, Dhanmondi, Sutrapur and Demra areas. Data collection at DCC areas under 28 police stations on Nov 20. The total number of registration centres is 951. Data collectors had filled up forms of over 2.24 million voters until Thursday, Biswas added. bdnews24.c
