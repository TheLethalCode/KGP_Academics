<TITLE> Bolivia's Morales defends constitution rewrite </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 La Paz, Dec 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Evo Morales says his push to overhaul Bolivia's constitution will "hand power to the people" and dismisses claims by critics that the move is aimed at concentrating his power. The sweeping constitutional changes, a key Morales project, are at the center of a power struggle between the leftist leader and his conservative rivals. His foes shut down large parts of Bolivia on Wednesday in a one-day protest after his allies pushed through a draft of the constitution last weekend in an assembly boycotted by the opposition and amid protests that left at least three people dead. "This new constitution will hand power to the people and deepens democracy," Morales told Reuters in an interview. The new framework would allow Morales to seek re-election indefinitely, give indigenous groups more political power and increase state control over the economy in the mineral-rich country. Morales, Bolivia's first Indian leader, said the proposed overhaul "changes a colonial state, changes a neoliberal (economic) model." But it has deepened ethnic and regional divisions in South America's poorest country and heightened political tensions, with his critics accusing him of unilaterally forcing through his proposed reforms. It also leaves Morales confronting one of his most serious political crises since taking office in January 2006. His move to empower the poor, indigenous majority through the charter rewrite has angered many in the traditional white and mixed-race business elite, who accuse Morales of focusing solely on his political base. STATE-RUN RESOURCES "Bolivia's natural resources will never again be privatized," Morales, who nationalized Bolivia's natural gas industry last year, said during the interview at the presidential palace late on Friday. The new constitution envisions public services like water "as a human right that should be part of the state, not private," he said. "This a deep transformation." That vision clashes with the free-market economic support by many of his opponents. Based in lowland areas that are home to the agricultural heartland and natural gas reserves, his foes say they want a constitution that gives them more autonomy from the central government in La Paz. They accuse Morales of following the lead of his two main leftist allies, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa, in pushing for constitutional reforms to weaken opponents and win more time in office. The draft constitution still needs final approval by the assembly before being put to a national referendum. Morales, the son of a highland peasant who herded llamas as a boy, said the elite were trying to stymie his reforms because they do not like having an indigenous leader in power. "That's the mentality they have. The poor have to fight for social justice and there are groups that are resisting," he said. "That's Bolivia's problem -- rich and poor. The poor are looking for equality and the rich are looking to accumulate more wealth." bd
