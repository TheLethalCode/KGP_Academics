At 0814 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.5 percent at 1,509.19 points, adding to a 2.7-percent rise on Wednesday when prospects of another US interest rate cut and consolidation talk in financials boosted stocks. Banks were the top weighted gainers on the index, accounting for nearly 60 percent of the benchmark's increase. British lender Alliance & Leicester jumped 10 percent after it said that before writedowns, its profit was expected to beat consensus.

UBS added 1.9 percent, Credit Suisse 1.7 percent, BNP Paribas 2.1 percent and UniCredit 1.5 percent. The DJ Stoxx European banking index was up 1.4 percent. Defensive food and pharmaceutical stocks fell, with AstraZeneca down 1.2 percent. bdnews24.com/lq/1517hrs Analysts said the upswing might prove short-lived.
