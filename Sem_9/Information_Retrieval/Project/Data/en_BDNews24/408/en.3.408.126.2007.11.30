 MUZAFFARABAD, Pakistan, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Activists from an independence movement held a protest in Pakistani Kashmir on Friday calling for a truck service to be started between Muzaffarabad and Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian Kashmir. Around 100 people joined the demonstration in Muzaffarabad, before around three dozen took the protest to Chakothi, a small town close to the ceasefire line, or line of control, dividing the disputed Himalayan region. They were blocked from going any further by police. "A truck service between Muzaffarabad and Srinagar must be started soon if the two governments are sincere in helping Kashmiris. Otherwise we are right in believing that they are paying lip service to us," said Farooq Niazi, one of the demonstrators. The protesters belonged to the All Parties Nationalist Alliance, an umbrella organisation for nearly a dozen pro-independence Kashmiri groups. Residents in Chakothi said the protesters made speeches calling on India and Pakistan to let Kashmir become an independent nation. Indian Kashmir has been beset by separatist violence for years, but some Kashmiris in the Pakistani portion have also agitated peacefully for independence. India and Pakistan, which have fought three wars since partition in 1947, agreed in May 2006 to start a truck service between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad, one of many confidence-building measures undertaken since the two sides began a peace process in 2004. Several rounds of talks were held and the two sides have exchanged lists of items to be traded, but traders have been left waiting for the service to start.
