<TITLE> Accused Nazi guard fights deportation from US </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CINCINNATI, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A lawyer for accused Nazi guard John Demjanjuk argued on Thursday that a US immigration judge did not have the authority to deport the retired auto worker to his native Ukraine, the latest appeal in a 30-year legal battle. "You haven't heard the last from us," Ed Nishnic, Demjanjuk's former son-in-law, told reporters after a court hearing where the appeal was lodged. "We're trying to stop this process." The case against Demjanjuk, 87, once wrongly convicted of being the sadistic Nazi death camp guard "Ivan the Terrible," has come down to whether former Chief U.S. Immigration Judge Michael Creppy had the authority to rule on his deportation. Demjanjuk's lawyer, John Broadley, told the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati that Creppy was not authorized to judge the case because he had held an administrative, not adjudicative, position on the immigration review board. Broadley said the appeals court could take months to rule on the matter and family members promised to fight on to the US Supreme Court if necessary to prevent the deportation. Demjanjuk was ordered deported in December 2005 following a ruling that he had been a guard at a Nazi death camp in German-occupied Poland. In December 2006 Creppy dismissed an appeal by Demjanjuk to have a deportation order overturned. That decision is now being appealed. Demjanjuk, who had fought to keep his US citizenship for 30 years, has argued he could be prosecuted or face torture if he is sent back to Ukraine -- or Germany or Poland if Ukraine refused to accept him. Demjanjuk was first stripped of his US citizenship in 1981 and extradited to Israel, where he was sentenced to death in 1988 on eyewitness testimony from Holocaust survivors that he was the notorious Ivan of the Treblinka death camp, where 870,000 people died. The Israeli Supreme Court overturned his death sentence in 1993 and freed him after records from the former Soviet Union showed another man, Ivan Marchenko, was probably the sadistic guard at Treblinka. The United States restored Demjanjuk's citizenship in 1998 based on the wrongful accusations but the Justice Department refiled its case against him, arguing he had worked for the Nazis as a guard at three concentration camps. Demjanjuk was stripped of his citizenship again after a ruling in 2002 found in favor of the Justice Department. Demjanjuk was not in court on Thursday, and his son, John Demjanjuk Jr., and former son-in-law Nishnic said he was no longer following the details of the case. "He's old. He's not in good health," Nishnic said. "He's in a way oblivious to what's going on in the courtroom." Demjanjuk, who lives near Cleveland, immigrated to the United States in 1952 and became a naturalized citizen in 1958.
