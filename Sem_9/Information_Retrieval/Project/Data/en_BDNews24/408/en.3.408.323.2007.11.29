<TITLE> US to submit evidence against Iraqi photographer </TITLE>

 BAGHDAD, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US military will submit evidence to the Iraqi judiciary on Dec. 9 against an award-winning Associated Press photographer who has been detained for 19 months, the news agency said on Thursday. The US military has accused Bilal Hussein, a 36-year-old Iraqi, of working with insurgents in Iraq. He was seized in April 2006 in Ramadi, capital of western Anbar province, and has been imprisoned without charge ever since. The AP has repeatedly called for the immediate release of Hussein, who was part of its photo team that won a Pulitzer prize in 2005. It said in a news report from Baghdad that under Iraqi law, an investigative judge would review the evidence and decide whether to dismiss the case or send it to a three-member court for trial. "The move would be the first legal step in initiating formal charges against photographer Bilal Hussein," the AP said. The agency said it was notified on Thursday about the date for evidence submission. AP President and Chief Executive Officer Tom Curley wrote to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki this week to express concern that Hussein's lawyer had not been given enough time and information to prepare his defence, the AP report said. "While we are grateful that Mr. Hussein will finally have a chance to see and challenge the evidence against him, we are deeply concerned that US military authorities are doing their best to make it difficult for his case to receive a fair hearing," Curley said in his letter. "US military attorneys have had 19 months to prepare for this important day ... Mr. Hussein's attorney, on the other hand, will have no idea which allegations and what evidence he must seek to overcome with arguments and evidence of his own." The US military has said Hussein was detained for possessing material used to make roadside bombs, insurgent propaganda, and what it described as a surveillance photo of a coalition installation. US military spokesman Major-General Kevin Bergner said this month that Hussein's case had been reviewed several times by a board that periodically reviews the files of detainees. Hussein was still deemed a "security threat", he said. Hussein is just one of several Iraqi journalists who have been held by the US military without being charged. Reuters journalists have also been detained by the US military for months and later released without charges.
