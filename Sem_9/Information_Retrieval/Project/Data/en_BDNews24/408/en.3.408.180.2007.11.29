<TITLE> Germany arrests man for doing business with Iran </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BERLIN, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany's federal prosecutor's office said on Thursday it had arrested a German-Iranian man for doing business with Iran through a Frankfurt-based company which supplies goods for military and nuclear purposes. German law and United Nations sanctions prevent companies from supplying Iran with goods intended for nuclear or military uses. The West fears Iran is trying to build nuclear weapons. "The accused is suspected of breaking foreign trade law through dealings with Iranian businesses," the office said in a statement, adding that police had searched company offices in Frankfurt and Ludwigshafen, in south Germany. The 48-year-old, referred to as "Mohsen V." was arrested last week. Germany is one of Iran's largest trading partners in the EU, although exports have fallen sharply this year amid pressure from the United States for German firms to cut their ties to the Islamic Republic. Iran says its nuclear programme is for peaceful civilian energy purposes.
