 MOSCOW, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin's party stands to win an overwhelming majority in Russia's parliamentary election on Sunday but the victory is likely to be undermined by accusations the Kremlin has tipped the scales in its favour. Putin, 55, has repeatedly promised to step down after his second presidential term ends next May. But he wants to retain power and influence afterwards and says a strong victory for his United Russia party in parliament will give him that mandate. This, analysts say, has turned the election into a referendum on Putin, by far Russia's most popular politician. It is not a vote the Kremlin intends to lose. Giant billboards promoting Putin and United Russia dominate the streets in Moscow and other cities. State-run television news bulletins lead with long reports on the president and his government, while opposition figures appear briefly at the end. Reports in Russian media list instances of state employees being encouraged to vote at work, of pressure being applied to companies to fund United Russia and even of schools encouraging parents to do their patriotic duty and back the president. Putin has rejected any suggestion of foul play. "We know the value of true democracy and want to conduct elections that are honest, as transparent as possible and open," he told ambassadors in Moscow on Wednesday. "We are sure this is the way these elections will be." Meanwhile opposition parties complain of harassment, including arrests and the confiscation of leaflets. Foreign observers have had trouble getting visas. Numerous changes in the law make it far harder for Kremlin opponents to get elected. These include a new, seven percent hurdle to win any seats. Europe's main election monitoring watchdog ODIHR, seen by Western governments as a benchmark in measuring election fairness, will not be present at Sunday's vote. It pulled out, citing obstructions by Moscow, a charge the Kremlin denies. WIDESPREAD CYNICISM The effects of the lopsided contest have been two-fold. Opinion polls point to United Russia winning between 60 percent and 70 percent of seats in the Duma (lower house of parliament) on Sunday. But they also indicate widespread cynicism and indifference. This is not new -- in a strongly presidential system like Russia's, the Duma has long played a junior role. Putin has enjoyed a majority there for his nearly eight years in office. But it may matter more this time, diplomats say, because of Putin's wish to win a strong mandate to continue steering Russia from beyond the Kremlin. How he intends to do this in a country with a strong tradition of centralised power remains unclear. Speculation has included Putin as prime minister, as a party leader like the old Soviet general secretary, as head of a huge state energy corporation, as head of a revived KGB spy agency and even as a "national leader" along Chinese lines. In a country with a long tradition of authoritarianism, comparisons with Soviet times abound. "Elections without choice", commented the New Times, an independent political weekly, above an article illustrated by a Soviet-style poster urging the masses to back Putin. "The old Soviet mentality is alive and well and people are returning to their former ways," echoed political analyst Georgy Bovt in a newspaper article. Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov agrees. He has accused the Kremlin of "trying to create a new version of the Soviet Communist Party", though arguably the original is still doing well. Zyuganov's party is the biggest opposition grouping and the only one polls say is certain to enter the next Duma. Putin himself has struck a fiercely nationalistic pose in the campaign, attacking foreigners for "poking their snotty noses" into Russia's affairs, deriding opposition politicians as the lackeys of Western embassies and accusing the United States of plotting to undermine the election. He has not been shy about telling Russians how to vote, using a nationwide television broadcast on Thursday to instruct citizens to turn out on Sunday and choose United Russia in order to ensure Russia's continued stability and continuity. Avenues for protest are limited. The Supreme Court has rejected a complaint from the right-wing SPS party that Putin should be struck off the list of candidates for abusing his office to undermine the opposition. The Central Electoral Commission, now run by a former classmate of Putin's, has dismissed complaints by the opposition of unequal media coverage and irregularities in the campaign. And former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, an opposition icon, was serving a five-day jail sentence for leading an opposition march last Saturday.
