 TOKYO, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan will call for an early solution to a feud with China over disputed gas fields when foreign ministers meet for broad-ranging talks in Beijing this weekend, a Japanese ministry official said. Frosty relations between the Asian neighbours have thawed over the past year -- an improvement symbolised by this week's landmark port call to Tokyo by a Chinese missile destroyer.

Both sides are eager to secure new oil and gas supplies but disagree over where the maritime boundary separating their exclusive economic zones should lie. China's state-controlled CNOOC Ltd said in April that it had begun producing gas from Tianwaitian field and was ready to begin producing from the larger Chunxiao field in the area, raising fears in resource-poor Japan fears that such production could siphon gas from what Tokyo sees as its side of the zo
