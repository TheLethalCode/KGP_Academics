 STRASBOURG, France, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Court of Human Rights has fined Belgium for raiding the premises of a German reporter investigating financial irregularities within the European Union in a test case on confidential sources. The court fined Belgium 10,000 euros ($14,730) plus 30,000 euros costs after ruling that the raids in 2002 on the home and office of Stern magazine reporter Hans Martin Tillack contravened his right as a reporter to keep his sources secret. "The right of journalists to keep their sources secret ... is a true attribute of the right to information which is to be treated with the utmost regard," the Strasbourg-based court ruled in a judgment handed down on Tuesday. The judgment differs from an October, 2006, ruling by the European Union's Court of First Instance in Luxembourg, which dismissed Tillack's claim for damages, saying it had no reason to get involved. Belgian police seized documents, two computers, four portable telephones and a filing cabinet in raids carried out after the EU's anti-fraud office OLAF filed a complaint against Tillack on suspicion of paying an EU employee for information. The accusations have never been proved. Tillack, who wrote a series of articles about alleged financial irregularities at the EU's statistics arm Eurostat, has since got his documents back. Belgium hosts the EU's major institutions, NATO and dozens of international concerns and lobby groups. The European Commission said in a statement that it was "not a party to the proceedings", because it had not raided Tillack's home itself. The Belgian Justice Ministry said that a law had been passed in 2005 which reinforced the rights of journalists and the protection of their sources. "The law of protection of journalistic sources would not allow these raids now," said Annaik de Voghel, the spokeswoman of Justice Minister Laurette Onkelinx. She added that raids were now only allowed at the request of an investigative judge and if the information was vital to prevent someone being harmed, such as to prevent a bomb or to find a kidnapped child.
