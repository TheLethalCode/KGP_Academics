 MADRID, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid favour the creation of a new body to represent Europe's clubs in place of the G14, the Spanish champions' president Ramon Calderon said on Thursday. "In previous times the great differences in opinions between UEFA and the top clubs gave rise to the body known as the G14, to defend the interests of those clubs," Calderon told the Primera Liga side's Web site (www.realmadrid.com). "But the gradual improvement in relations between UEFA and the clubs, especially since the arrival of their new president Michel Platini, makes it necessary to reconsider the need for a parallel organisation. "Real have confidence in the current governors of UEFA and believe that through it we will be able to reach the best solutions for the problems within European football. "If this new climate continues..... we don't think the existence of an organisation like the G14 will be necessary and we would be happy to contribute actively to the creation of a true European association of clubs. "It would be independent but recognised by UEFA, and would allow us to resolve problems within this great family of clubs assuring collaboration and stability." The G14 said in September that it would expand from 18 to around 50 members by the end of the year to try to resolve differences with soccer's governing bodies over issues such as the calendar and release of players for international duty. The group includes powerful clubs such as Manchester United, Real and AC Milan
