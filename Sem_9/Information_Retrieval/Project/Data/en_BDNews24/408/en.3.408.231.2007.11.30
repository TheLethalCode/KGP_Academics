<TITLE> India's Jaffer looks ahead to Australia with caution </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KOLKATA, India, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Scoring an unbeaten 192 against Pakistan in a single day on Friday is a confidence booster for the tour of Australia starting next month, India opener Wasim Jaffer said. It will not make the tour any easier, though, said Jaffer, who shared in two century partnerships against a weak Pakistan attack on the opening day of the second test to steer India to a commanding 352 for three. "Obviously scoring runs before the Australian tour will help," Jaffer told a news conference. "(But) the conditions, pitch and the bowing will be different. Going into Australia, we don't want to think too much ahead." Pakistan were hampered by a half-fit Shoaib Akhtar, who bowled only nine overs in four spells. India will bank on Jaffer's solidity at the top of the order in Australia where they play four tests with the first beginning on Dec. 26. The 29-year-old Mumbai batsman, who took his tally to five centuries, is enjoying his good form. "I don't think I have batted so fluently in my test career; 192 in a single day, I haven't done it before," he said. "I'm used to scoring big. I've not been doing it frequently in international cricket and I'll try and do that from here on." India recorded a rare test series victory in England this year, where Jaffer scored two fifties, and will be looking to build on it in Australia where they squared a series in 2004. Though the middle order is in the safe hands of the experienced trio of Sachin Tendulkar, Saurav Ganguly and Vangipurappu Laxman, and Rahul Dravid is sound at three, the form of Jaffer's opening partner Dinesh Karthik is a concern. Karthik failed in a third straight innings on Friday when he edged left-arm quick Sohail Tanvir to slip for one. "I know how it feels. I wish him luck," empathised Jaffer, who scored a fifty in the first test which the hosts won by six wickets in New Delhi
