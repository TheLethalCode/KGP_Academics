<TITLE> Help S Leone's child soldiers more, UN judge says </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ABIDJAN, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A judge on Sierra Leone's war crimes court has appealed to foreign donors to fund projects to teach a trade to thousands of former child soldiers to bring them back into society. The West African state is slowly rebuilding after a civil war from 1991 to 2002 in which thousands of children were kidnapped, drugged and forced to fight for rival rebel groups. Many killed civilians or hacked off limbs. A disarmament and reinsertion programme for ex-fighters ended several years ago, but Renate Winter, an Austrian judge at Sierra Leone's UN-backed Special Court, said more was needed. "It's wrong for donors to just demobilise (combatants) then stop. You've only done half the job. You have to give them not only training but also a job," she told Reuters in an interview late on Thursday. In July, the Special Court sentenced three former militia leaders to long jail terms for war crimes and crimes against humanity, including the abduction of children for slavery and for service as soldiers. Winter attended a conference in Ivory Coast's main city of Abidjan this week organised by the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime to look at ways of preventing the forced recruitment of children. She estimated 5,000-10,000 child soldiers had fought in Sierra Leone's civil war. "They hang around in Freetown day and night to wait for someone to give them a job. This is a population that can became dangerous. If you do want to keep peace, you have to find a solution for those you have disarmed," Winter said. She suggested experimenting with projects that would not only teach job skills but also help young ex-combatants to find employment or set up in business by themselves: "If I train someone to become a plumber and I don't give him tools to start a small business, how is he going to continue?" She said some ex-combatants were no longer accepted in their own village or community because of their violent acts. Winter said Sierra Leone now seemed quite stable and that the population was tired of war. A UN peacekeeping mission ended in 2005. Other meetings similar to the Abidjan conference have taken place around the world and the conclusions will contribute to a global action plan to be presented in Vienna in February by the UN Global Initiative in the Fight Against Trafficki
