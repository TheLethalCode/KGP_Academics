<TITLE> Belgian coalition talks fail, negotiator to quit </TITLE>

 BRUSSELS, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Would-be Belgian prime minister Yves Leterme will resign as coalition negotiator on Saturday, signalling the collapse of marathon talks to form a four-party government, his party's spokesman said. Leterme's Flemish Christian Democrats, the Flemish Liberals and their French-speaking counterparts have held on-off negotiations for a record 174 days since a June 10 general election, but they appear to have failed over the central issue of devolving more power to the regions. Belgium's political future is now unclear with no obvious alternative coalition, fuelling speculation of a possible break-up of the linguisitically divided country. A spokesman for the Flemish Christian Democrats said Leterme would inform King Albert on Saturday. "He will give up his task," the spokesman said.
