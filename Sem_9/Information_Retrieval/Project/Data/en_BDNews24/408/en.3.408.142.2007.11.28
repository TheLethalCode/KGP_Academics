 WASHINGTON, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The White House on Wednesday welcomed a decision by Pakistani President Gen. Pervez Musharraf to quit as his country's army chief. "The president certainly considers that to be a good step," White House press secretary Dana Perino said. "President Musharraf followed through on his commitment to remove the uniform. It was significant for him." But Perino repeated the White House's call for Musharraf to end emergency rule in Pakistan.
