<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com)  The 10th anniversary of the Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Agreement is on Sunday, Dec 2. On this day in 1997 the Janasanghati Samiti (JSS) signed peace deal with the then Awami League government. The JSS, for the first time, was not holding a commemorative programme in Dhaka or Chittagong. The Bangladesh Adibashi Forum, a JSS supported group, was also commemorating the day. JSS district chairman and regional council member Sadhuram Tripura Milton told bdnews24.com's Bandarban correspondent that his organisation was not observing the anniversary due to the present situation of the country. "We are providing our full assistance to the incumbent government. That's why we did not take up any programmes." The bdnews24.com Rangamati correspondent said the JSS was not observing the peace agreement anniversary in Rangamati and Khagrachhari either. Hafizur Rahman Master, leader of the Hill Tracts Equal Rights Movement, said they would hold discussions and hoist black flags in Bandarban. The JSS alleged many terms of the accord had not been implemented yet. The peace deal concluded a two-decade bush war between the army and former guerilla groups. Some 70,000 Hill Tracts people returned from India after a decade-long existence as refugees. The anti-peace agreement United Peoples Democratic Front and JSS have clashed over the peace accord, resulting in the deaths of nearly 500 people over the last 10 years. bdnews2
