<TEXT>
 KOLKATA, India, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan fast bowler Umar Gul will return home because of back trouble and the injury-hit side have called for replacements before the second test against India starting on Friday, skipper Shoaib Malik said. "Gul is going back," Malik told reporters on Thursday. "He bowled all out yesterday at practice, but felt pain today, so he is being sent back. We've called for replacements and given the selectors a few options. We're hoping they will reach today." Gul, 23, missed the first test due to the injury. Malik is also doubtful for the match due to an ankle injury picked up while playing soccer on Monday after India won the first test by six wickets. "I walked and jogged but felt pain," he said. "I'll take a fitness test tomorrow and decide." Strike bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Sami also did not bowl at the nets for the second consecutive day due to chest infections, but Malik said both were recovering well. With in-form batsman Misbah-ul-Haq also recovering from a viral infection, the visitors are struggling to put up a fit starting 11 as they bid to stave off a resurgent India intent on sealing a rare series victory against their archrivals at home. Of the available bowlers in the 15-man squad only left-arm pacer Sohail Tanvir and spinners Danish Kaneria and Abdur Rehman are in shape to play. India last won a test series against Pakistan at home in 1979-80. "This is an opportunity for us to set the record straight," India captain Anil Kumble told reporters. "It seems to be a decent wicket and it should play well. But it is for us to take the momentum from Kotla (venue of the first test in New Delhi) and ensure that we turn the screws on early." The final test will be played in Banga
