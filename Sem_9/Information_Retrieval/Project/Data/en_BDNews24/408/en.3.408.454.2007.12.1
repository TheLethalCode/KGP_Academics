<TEXT>
 KANDY, Sri Lanka, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Matthew Hoggard and Monty Panesar shared seven wickets as Sri Lanka were bowled out for 188 on first day of the first test against England on Saturday. Hoggard was responsible for the early wickets, reducing the hosts to 42 for 5 before lunch, while left-arm spinner Panesar helped to finish off the lower order. Panesar finished with 3 for 46 from 14 overs and Hoggard returned figures of 4 for 29 from 14 overs. Kumar Sangakkara rescued the hosts from an embarrassingly low score with a fine 92, falling short of a century only because of a spectacular diving catch from Paul Collingwood at backward point. Sri Lanka's bowlers hit back before bad light stopped play early with Chaminda Vaas pinning Alastair Cook lbw in the first over of the innings. Fellow new ball bowler Lasith Malinga also had a good shout for lbw turned down against Michael Vaughan early on. Ian Bell scored freely to finish the day on 36 and Vaughan closed on 13. England were 49 for one at stumps. Sri Lanka had batted first after winning the toss on a dry pitch under clear blue skies, conditions that appeared to be ideal for batting at the time. However, Hoggard produced a superb 10-over spell with the new ball, claiming 4-21 after maintaining a tight line and finding some early swing. TUMBLING WICKETS Sanath Jayasuriya (10) started the innings positively with a brace of boundaries before being brilliantly caught by Kevin Pietersen at cover point off left-arm Ryan Sidebottom. Opener Michael Vandort (eight) mistimed a checked drive and chipped a simple catch to Vaughan at mid on. Straight after the first drinks break of the day the wickets started to tumble fast as Hoggard dismissed skipper Mahela Jayawardene (one) with a perfectly-pitched outswinger. Chamara Silva (two) fell to a similar swinging delivery, pushing forward and edging behind to wicket-keeper Matthew Prior. Five balls later Hoggard managed to seam the ball in the opposite direction and found another outside edge, this time off left-hander Jehan Mubarak who departed for a duck on his recall to the test team. Wicket-keeper Prasanna Jayawardene gave Sangakkara solid support, batting positively for his 51 from 102 balls with nine boundaries. The pair added 106 runs in 30.1 overs either side of the lunch break before left-arm spinner Monty Panesar snared Jayawardene at short leg. Sangakkara batted brilliantly, expertly negotiating the early swing movement and seizing on any opportunity to score, stroking 13 stylish boundaries in his 159-ball knock. Jayawardene's departure precipitated a further collapse as Panesar bowled Vaas (12) and snared Dilhara Fernando (nought) off a leading edge. England had earlier preferred all rounder Ravi Bopara to middle-order batsman Owais Shah and picked fast bowler James Anderson ahead of Steve Harmiso
