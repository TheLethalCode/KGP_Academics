<TITLE> EU agrees trade deals with Papua New Guinea, Fiji </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BRUSSELS, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Commission said on Friday it had initialled a new trade deal with Papua New Guinea and Fiji as part of its attempts to land a string of new agreements with former European colonies by the end of the year. The deal, initialled late on Thursday, would be a particular boost for fisheries exports of the two Pacific states, the European Union executive said. After more than five years of talks, Brussels has warned the African, Caribbean and Pacific group of nearly 80 countries they risk higher EU tariffs for their exports from Jan. 1 if they do not strike deals now. The ACP countries have long had preferential trade arrangements with the EU but they must be scrapped by Dec. 31, when a World Trade Organisation waiver expires. So far only a few states in three of the six ACP regions -- eastern and southern Africa as well as the Pacific -- have initialled the so-called Economic Partnership Agreements. EU negotiators this week flew from Brussels for urgent talks with the ACP's Caribbean countries and with Ivory Coast, Gabon and Cameroon whose exports of bananas and cocoa will be hit by higher EU tariffs from Jan. 1 without a deal. The deals agreed so far and most of those being negotiated are interim, covering trade in goods and aid but not services or investment rules which would be discussed in 2008. Only the Caribbean is likely to sign up at a first stage to a full EPA. Some ACP governments and campaign groups say the deals will open up developing economies to too much competition. But Brussels says the changes will be gradual and the deals will help foster regional economies, attracting investment and helping ACP nations diversify away from basic commodities.
