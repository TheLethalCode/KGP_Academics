 BRUSSELS, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Belgium plunged deeper into political uncertainty on Saturday when would-be prime minister Yves Leterme abandoned efforts to form a four-party centre-right government after the collapse of marathon talks. His Flemish Christian Democrats, the Flemish Liberals and their French-speaking counterparts have held on-off negotiations for a record 174 days since the general election, but failed to agree on the key issue of devolving more power to the regions. Leterme set a midday deadline for parties to accept his final plan. When one of them declined to do so, he went to King Albert to be discharged from his task of forming a government. The political future of the country of 10.5 million is now unclear with no obvious alternative coalition. This will fuel speculation of a possible break-up of the linguistically-divided federal state, which is home to the European Union's main institutions and NATO. Leterme told reporters in parliamentthat the talks had made progress on socio-economic challenges but that clear agreement could not be reached on a vital state reform. "I myself remain available to continue working towards solutions," he said. Talk of the 177-year-old country splitting into Dutch- and French-speaking parts has disturbed business leaders, who argue the deadlock will start driving away potential foreign investors and is already undoing a decade of budgetary discipline. WHAT NEXT? Carl Devos, political scientist at Ghent University, said it was not clear what would happen next. "That's the million dollar question. At this moment, the king will receive people and see what is possible," he said, adding that the four-parties could still form a government or the French-speaking Greens could be invited in. The socialists may also be sounded out. "It's hard to see a deal before Christmas," Devos said. Leterme, the former premier of Flanders, had asked all four parties to accept his plan for the state reform that the Flemish demand and French-speakers resist. He posed three questions. Were the other parties open to debate any possible issue? Were they willing to allow the regions to offer financial incentives to business? Could the measures be passed with no more than the required two-thirds majority in parliament? Three parties replied "yes", but the francophone counterpart of the Christian Democrats declined to do so. Dutch-speaking Flanders, the wealthier and more populous region, wants to gain control of labour market policy and be able to vary taxes, currently a federal government prerogative. French-speaking Wallonia, where the unemployment rate is double that of Flanders, feels it will lose out if its northern neighbour is able to entice companies with lower corporate tax. Political analysts believe Belgium will remain united despite growing strains, partly because untangling intertwined institutions and sharing the heavy national debt would be unfathomably difficult. The future of Brussels, a separate region within Flanders that is officially bilingual but with a large majority of French-speakers, would also have to be settled. Most Belgians also support unity, although the majority in favour among the Flemish population has slipped.
