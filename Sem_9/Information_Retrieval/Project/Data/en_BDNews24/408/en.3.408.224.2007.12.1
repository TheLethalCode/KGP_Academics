 BERLIN, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia's foreign intelligence services are accelerating efforts to recruit young lawmakers and academics in Germany, a German newspaper reported on Saturday. The domestic intelligence service (BfV) has information about efforts by Russian agents to recruit young members of the Bundestag, or lower house of parliament, Welt am Sonntag reported in a preview of its Sunday edition. Young officials from Germany's political parties and foundations were also being targeted with a view to gathering inside information or recruiting those with good career prospects, the paper said. It did not identify the source of its information. The BfV, which stands for federal office for the protection of the constitution, said on its Web site that Russia was among countries that continue to target Germany for intelligence gathering activities. It also cited China, Iran and North Korea. Officials at the BfV were not immediately available for comment on the report.
