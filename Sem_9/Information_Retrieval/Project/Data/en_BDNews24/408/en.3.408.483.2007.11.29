<TEXT>
 KARACHI, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - All-rounder Yasir Arafat will replace injured fast bowler Umar Gul in the Pakistan squad preparing for the second test against India starting in Kolkata on Friday. Pakistan selector Saleem Jaffer told Reuters Arafat would fly to India on Thursday night and would be available for selection. Gul, who missed the first test which India won by six wickets, has been ruled out of the three-match series because of a nagging back injury. Arafat, 25, last played for Pakistan in the Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa in September. Jaffer said he had been picked because the Pakiatan team, who are struggling with illness and injuries, needed more depth in their batting. Strike bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Sami did not bowl at the nets on Thursday for the second consecutive day because of chest infections and captain Shoaib Malik is doubtful because of an ankle injury. Opening bat Salman Butt has influenza and batsman Misbah-ul-Haq is recovering from a viral infection
