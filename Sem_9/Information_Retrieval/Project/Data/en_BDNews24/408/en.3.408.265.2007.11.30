 MADRID, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World number two Rafael Nadal has no problems that could prevent him pursuing a career at the top of his profession, his doctor Angel Ruiz Cotorro has said. "After carrying out routine tests, I consider Rafael to be in perfect condition to continue developing his career in the coming years," Ruiz Cotorro said in a statement carried in the Spanish media on Friday. The 21-year-old Spaniard's fitness was called into question on Wednesday when his coach and uncle Toni Nadal said in an interview that an old injury to his left foot was "very serious." Nadal and his coach quickly moved to deny the story saying it had been blown out of all proportion. "I am absolutely certain the said injury will not be a handicap (to his professional activities at the highest level)," Ruiz Cotorro continued. "He picked it up in April 2004. It was a stress fracture in the left foot. Once cured, a specific programme was instigated along with his fitness trainer Joan Forcades and physiotherapist Rafael Maymo." This included a physiotherapy programme and special insoles for his shoes to help improve the movement and musculature in the area. "From a medical point of view, by following the programme Rafael has been able to develop his professional career to the highest level winning 23 titles over the last three years," he added. Ruiz Cotorro is also the Spanish Tennis Federation's doctor
