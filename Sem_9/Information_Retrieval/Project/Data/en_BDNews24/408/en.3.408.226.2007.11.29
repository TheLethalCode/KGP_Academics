 Barguna, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com)  Hundreds of cyclone-stricken villagers demonstrated for immediate relief at the Barguna district headquarters defying emergency rule for a second day Thursday. Two weeks after the Cyclone Sidr slammed into the southern districts, hapless communities living in remote pockets are yet to receive life-supporting aid, reports bdnews24.com's Barguna correspondent. Those taking part in Thursday's procession from Dopati village told bdnews24.com that they were staging protests after waiting patiently for the past two weeks since the catastrophe. Authorities stopped the procession headed for the deputy commissioner's office on Sadar Road in Barguna. The demonstrators subsequently dispersed and returned home after DC Md Altaf Hossain and local joint forces commander M Basir Ahmed assured them that relief would reach them as soon as possible. One of the demonstrators Hemayetuddin Khan alleged that none from the local administration, including their UP chairman Abi Abdullah Bachchu Khan, had enquired about their welfare since Nov 15, when the cyclone struck. The UP chairman, however, told bdnews24.com that he had visited the worst-affected areas of his union and distributed relief through the local UP members. "We have been distributing relief in the district in phases and the allocations will soon increase," district commissioner Md Altaf Hossain told bdnews24.com. Hundreds of Sidr victims had demonstrated in front of Barguna Press Club the previous day. Wednesday morning saw a gathering of some 500 men, women and children of Uttor Khajurtala village, chanting slogans demanding emergency relief. They carried banners reading: "We survived the storm surge but may die now." "We need food, clothes and medical care immediately." bdnews24.com/corr/s
