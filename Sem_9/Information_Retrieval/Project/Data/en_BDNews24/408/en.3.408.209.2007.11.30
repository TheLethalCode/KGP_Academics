<TEXT>
 La Paz, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Leftist Bolivian President Evo Morales called on Thursday for talks with opposition leaders, but they said he must first make concessions in his drive to rewrite the country's constitution. After the opposition shut down six of the country's nine provinces with a general strike on Wednesday, Morales said, "We hope these people (the opposition) reflect profoundly and together we can commit to Bolivia. I want again to call the (regional) governors to dialogue." Speaking to reporters at the presidential palace, Morales accused the opposition of "talking of unity but shouting for independence, talking about democracy but calling for civil disobedience." The constitutional reform, which Morales says will empower Bolivia's poor, indigenous minority, has become the focus of a power struggle between the president and rightist rivals who want more autonomy for their regions. Morales' allies approved the new draft constitution in an assembly on Saturday held under military guard without opposition delegates who declared the maneuver undemocratic. Violent unrest over the weekend killed at least three people in the southern city of Sucre, some 435 miles (700 km) south of La Paz. Several conservative opposition leaders said they would only agree to meet Morales if he gave ground. The former coca farmeris now facing one of his biggest crises since he took office in January 2006, "Unless (Morales) goes back on the illegal acts, there won't be any dialogue," Branco Marinkovic, a prominent opposition figure in the eastern city of Santa Cruz, the economic hub of the natural-gas rich Andean country. "'Yes' to dialogue if he (Morales) asks for forgiveness for the deaths and the blood on his hands. 'Yes' to dialogue if democracy prevails once again," Santa Cruz Governor Ruben Costas told reporters. The impoverished country remained tense on Thursday and the Catholic Church called for worshipers to pray for peace and national unity in services on Friday. European Union diplomats expressed concern over the "climate of confrontation" after meeting Morales. Opponents of Morales accuse him of pandering to his Aymara and Quechua Indian power base and ignoring other Bolivians. A close ally of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, he is Bolivia's first leader of indigenous descent. The draft constitution still needs final approval by the assembly, and would then go to a national referendum vote.
