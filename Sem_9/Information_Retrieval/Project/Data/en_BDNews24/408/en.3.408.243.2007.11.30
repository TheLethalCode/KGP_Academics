 LUCERNE, Switzerland, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Euro 2008 organisers have resolved an argument with tax authorities in Switzerland by agreeing that players involved in the tournament should be taxed at source. In a statement released on Friday, the organisers said players would be taxed a flat rate of 20 percent on any prize money passed on to them by their national associations. The rule will not be applied to coaches, association officials or other non-playing delegates. European soccer body UEFA had argued that the players should only pay taxes in their home countries, while the Swiss authorities had called for taxes to be levied locally at rates set by the individual host cantons. Under the agreement, UEFA will now withhold part of the prize money awarded to the various associations, who will then have to provide details on the payouts given to each player before receiving any money left over. The flat rate tax will be applied to all players whether they play their matches in Switzerland or in co-hosting Austria. The statement did not say whether players would still be expected to pay additional tax back home, or if they would pay more tax in total as a result of the agreement. Organisers said the deal would involve an estimated total taxation of between four and eight million Swiss francs ($3.58 million and $7.15 million). Friday's announcement comes two days before the tournament's official draw takes place in the Swiss city of Lucerne. Sixteen teams including title holders Greece are taking part in the tournament from June 7 to 29
