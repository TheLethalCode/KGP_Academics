 OSLO, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Norway and Finland have protested against Afghanistan's release of five prisoners earlier sentenced to death for a bomb attack that killed one Finnish peackeeper and wounded three Norwegians, officials said. An Afghan civilian was also killed in the blast that struck the Norwegian-lead peacekeeping unit on May 23 outside a NATO base at Maimana, the capital of Faryab province. The five Afghans jailed for the attack on the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) convoy were freed recently in a presidential amnesty though they had initially been sentenced to death and later had their sentences commuted to 20 years. "It is not quite clear to us yet why they were released, and Norway has protested heavily against this," a Norwegian foreign ministry spokesman said on Wednesday. "Norway needs information on why they were released and what Afghanistan will do to apprehend the people responsible for this bomb," spokesman Paul Bjoerdal said. Norwegian envoy Kai Eide met senior Afghan officials on Monday to raise the matter, he said. Finland's foreign ministry said in a statement earlier this week that it had sent a note to Kabul demanding an explanation. "Finland and Norway have together reacted to the information and are clarifying what has happened," the Finnish foreign ministry said.
