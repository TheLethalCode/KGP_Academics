 MADRID, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spain's High Court issued 46 arrest warrants for members of the Basque group Ekin, suspected by the authorities of having political links with the guerrilla group ETA, judicial sources said on Friday. The Spanish authorities have been investigating the activities of the group, believed to be behind violent street protests, since 1998. The arrests have been ordered as the court thought some of the accused might leave the country, the sources said. They have been charged with having links or collaborating with a terrorist organisation. Spanish media reported police were making the arrests in the Basque Country and the neighbouring region of Navarre.
