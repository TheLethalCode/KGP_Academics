<TITLE> Kasparov leaves jail, warns of Russia dictatorship </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former world chess champion Garry Kasparov said on Thursday Russia risked becoming a dictatorship, as he left jail after serving a five-day sentence for organising an illegal opposition protest. Police arrested Kasparov last weekend after he tried to protest outside the central election commission headquarters over Sunday's parliamentary election, which opponents of President Vladimir Putin say is skewed in his favour. Speaking to reporters outside his home after he was released, Kasparov said his trial was a "kangaroo court". He added: "I hope people around the world can see what happens to opposition activists in Russia ... This regime is entering a dangerous phase of becoming a distatorship." Russian officials say Kasparov and his supporters are dangerous radicals with only marginal support who are trying to undermine Russia's political stability.
