<TITLE> Sarkozy seeks to give French confidence a boost </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PARIS, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Nicolas Sarkozy promised on Thursday to speed up reforms and take a tough line on rioters to try to rebuild French confidence dented by weeks of protests. Judges and courtroom officials became the latest group on Thursday to go on strike, adding to a list that already includes transport and electricity workers, civil servants and students. Violence, strikes and protests as well as a feeling that the cost of living is being driven up by high oil, food and lodging prices have helped send household confidence to the lowest level in over a year. But Sarkozy, a law and order hardliner who was elected in May on a pledge to push through difficult changes, said France would not solve its problems by shying away from reform. "I did these reforms quickly because it was urgent. People sometimes criticise their speed. In fact, I would like to go much more quickly ... in order to boost growth as quickly as possible," Sarkozy said in a speech to police officers. "I know perfectly well that these reforms will not come without effort and tension," he added. His comments came as thousands of judges, judicial employees and lawyers went on strike over a plan to close nearly 200 court houses to simplify the system and save money. Some student unions also called for protests on Thursday demanding an end to a law giving universities more independence. Twenty-seven university sites were blocked on Thursday, a drop of 22 since Tuesday, the UNEF union said. Energy unions have called for another one-day strike on Dec. 6, a follow-up to strikes held jointly with transport workers in November and October over Sarkozy's pension reforms. "We are in testing times. Everything is accumulating, everything is building up ," Le Figaro said in an editorial. "Nicolas Sarkozy is playing a high stakes game ... because all these delayed bombs of French society are exploding in his face. The suburbs, pensions, students, quality of life. And in a more general way, the attitude of a country facing its future." PURCHASING POWER Sarkozy's speech to police, in which he promised to crack down on the "thugocracy" he blamed for youth violence this week in a Paris suburb, came ahead of a long-awaited announcement on Thursday evening of steps to improve purchasing power. Although official statistics show that purchasing power has improved slightly, French people consistently complain they feel out of pocket. This was reflected in a survey on Thursday showing consumer confidence slid in November to the lowest level since June 2006, a worrying sign for economic growth which relies heavily on household spending. France is under pressure from the European Commission for slipping in its plan to bring the budget into balance and has little leeway to announce new tax cuts or spending to put money into French wallets, a problem made worse by sluggish growth. The government has tried to temper expectations on Sarkozy's purchasing power speech while opposition politicians have jumped on his difficulties, blaming billions of euros in tax cuts passed in the summer for the tight budget. "The fiscal package did not boost growth ... it made inequalities worse by being generous to the wealthy and it used up all the budgetary margins for manoeuvre," Socialist party leader Francois Hollande said on LCI Television.
