 Dhaka, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com)  Only one lawyer, instead of the scheduled three, met detained former prime minister Sheikh Hasina in the special jail Saturday, a prisons official said. "Advocates Sahara Khatun and Khandaker Moniruzzaman and barrister Fazle Nur Taposh were scheduled to meet Sheikh Hasina Saturday," deputy inspector general, prisons, Shamsul Haider Siddiqui, told bdnews24.com. Only Khandaker Moniruzzaman went to the special jail and stayed there for one hour. The remaining two did not say why they did not turn up, he added. Siddiqui said Hasina talked to Moniruzzaman about cases, the extortion case filed by businessman Azam J Chowdhury in particular. Moniruzzaman did not speak to reporters on his way out of the jail. Sahara Khatun, when reached by bdnews24.com, said she had no schedule to meet Hasina Saturday. The other lawyer, Taposh, could not be contacted. bdnews2
