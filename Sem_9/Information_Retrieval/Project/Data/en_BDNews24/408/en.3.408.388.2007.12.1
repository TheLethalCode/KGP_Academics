 ROCHESTER, N.H., Nov 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two hostages were released after being held by a man claiming to have a bomb strapped to his chest at a New Hampshire campaign office for Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton on Friday, local media said. But it was not clear whether there were any hostages remaining in the campaign office in Rochester, New Hampshire and police were still surrounding the building. Witnesses at the scene said a woman, described as one of the hostages and said to be a campaign volunteer, had emerged from the building and was escorted to safety. New Hampshire's WMUR television said a second hostage had been released but that it was unclear if more were being held. Clinton, who was not in New Hampshire, canceled a speaking date in Virginia immediately after news of the incident broke, Democratic Party officials said. "There is an ongoing situation in our Rochester, New Hampshire office. We are in close contact with state and local authorities and are acting at their direction," said a statement from the Clinton campaign in Washington. A New Hampshire state police bomb squad had barricaded the scene and sealed off the area. Located 75 miles (120.7 km) north of Boston in Massachusetts, Rochester is home to 30,117 people and the site of one of 16 of Clinton's offices in the state, according to Clinton's campaign Web site.
