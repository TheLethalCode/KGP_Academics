<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com)  A 152-run stand between Tushar Imran and Saqib Al Hasan put league leaders Khulna in control against holders Dhaka Thursday at the close of the third day of the sixth-round four-dayer of National Cricket League. Khulna took an overall 337-run lead against the visitors after finishing the day on 288 for five in the second innings at Bir Shrestha Shaheed Motiur Rahman Stadium. Hosts Chittagong were on way to their second straight win over Barisal, who were struggling at 117 for seven at stumps in the second innings at Bir Shrestha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium. Barisal took an overall 58-run lead. Rajshahi were leading by 148 runs after they made 24 for two at stumps in the second innings against Barisal, who were wrapped up for 293 in the first innings in reply to Rajshahi's 417 all out at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. Khulna vs Dhaka Khulna after losing opener Nazmus Sadat for only six ended the day with 288 for five, thanks to a superb fourth-wicket partnership of 152 between Tushar and Saqib, who play for the national team. Tushar was just eight runs short of his second league century when he was bowled by Mahmudullah for a stroke-filled 92 off 122 balls including three sixes and nine fours. Saqib, however, unbeaten on 82, was on way to his second century after opener Imrul Kayes (48) and one-down Mustafizur Rahman (42) gave a decent start to Khulna, who drew with Dhaka in the first round in Dhaka. Earlier, Khulna pacer Mashrafee Bin Mortaza took two wickets in the morning on a flat wicket and Saqib and Ziaur Rahman one each to end the first innings of Dhaka, who added only 31 runs to their overnight total of 173 for six. Chittagong vs Barisal After a scintillating century in the first innings, Shahriar Nafees fell on nine to spark a Barisal batting collapse in the second innings. Pacer Kamrul Islam (3/26) and Dhiman Gosh (2/2) shared five wickets to wreck the opposition top and middle orders. Rakibul Hassan (43), Raisul Islam (21) and Humayun Kabir (26) provided some resistance in the middle after Barisal lost two wickets without a run. Nafis Iqbal took his overnight total of 118 to 153 off 293 balls with 11 fours and one six as Chittagong added 82 runs to the overnight score of 270 for four. They declared their first innings at 352 for eight, taking 59 runs lead. Rajshahi vs Sylhet Resuming the third day on 88 for one, Sylhet fell in deep trouble after a fierce spell from Gazi Alamgir who removed four Sylhet batsmen in a row. However, Golam Mabud and Ejaj Ahmed put on 135 runs for the sixth wicket to steady things. Saqlain Sajib then unleashed a devastating spell in which he took five for 55 to wrap the first innings up. Saqlain had Ejaj (65) caught by substitute to start the slide and completed his second five-wicket haul in the league, having Rashidur Rahman caught by Shahajada. Saqlain bettered his previous haul of five for 92. Rajshahi also faced a mini collapse in the second innings as they slipped to 24 for two at stumps. b
