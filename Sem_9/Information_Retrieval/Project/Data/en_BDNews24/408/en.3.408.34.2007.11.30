<TITLE> BALI CONFERENCE Bangladesh to propose hosting climate adaptation centre </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com)  The government will submit a proposal, at the upcoming UN Climate Change Conference in Bali, to create an international climate change adaptation centre in Bangladesh, an adviser said Friday. Environment and forests adviser CS Karim said: "We need help to cope with climate change. The conference will provide an opportunity for an open discussion on the matter." The Bali Climate Change Conference is scheduled to be held on the Indonesian island from Dec 3 to Dec 14. The adviser told reporters at a press conference at the ministry of environment and forests that the biodiversity of the Sundarbans had to be recovered. "We will highlight the risks we face in order to take a strong stand. We have to create an atmosphere to seek reparation. The media can help with this," Karim said. "International pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions were not kept. Frequent natural disasters are seen as a prelude to changes in climate." "The impact of climate change will affect least developed and low-lying countries. It will jeopardise food security and health," Karim said. Environment and forests secretary AHM Rezaul Kabir, in a prepared statement, said international funds for least developing countries to adopt climate change strategies were not sufficient. A proposal would be made in Bali to enlarge the funds. Dr Asaduzzaman, of the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies, told assembled reporters that climate instability was growing. But, he added, it was difficult to establish scientifically the notion that climate change was causing specific weather events. Ainun Nishat, resident director of the World Conservation Union (IUCN), said floods, droughts and tidal surges occur naturally. Cyclones are normal phenomena in November and December. But global temperature rises are affecting sea temperatures, said Nishat, adding that catastrophic weather events were increasing in both severity and frequency. bdnews24.c
