<TITLE> Democracy within parties necessary for democracy at large: Mainul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com)Land adviser Mainul Hosein has said the lack of practice of democracy within the political parties is the main reason for failure to sustain democracy in the country as a whole. "It is not possible to sustain democracy in the country with the dictatorship attitude in party constitutions," Mainul told reporters after a meeting on land allocation at the ministry Thursday. "If the government wishes it can change the law. The Election Commission can also amend electoral rules. But the political parties have to reform their constitutions on their own." "We don't have any remarks on the reforms within the parties. They have to make their constitutions democratic," the adviser said. bdnews24.co
