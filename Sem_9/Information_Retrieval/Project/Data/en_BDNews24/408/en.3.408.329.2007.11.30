 SYDNEY, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australian soccer officials want the sport's world governing body FIFA to punish Dutchman Dick Advocaat for reneging on his contract to coach the Socceroos. Advocaat had agreed to take over as Australia's next coach in time for the start of the 2010 World Cup qualifiers but pulled out after being offered a more lucrative deal to remain with his Russian club Zenit St Petersburg. Football Federation of Australia (FFA) boss Ben Buckley has already started an international search for a replacement but wants FIFA to take action against Advocaat to ensure the same thing does not happen again. "We put a lot of hard work and effort into securing his services and to be told on the eve of the World Cup campaign that he was not going to fulfil his contract is very disappointing," Buckley told the Sydney Morning Herald on Friday. "We've now prepared our case, we intend to go to FIFA, and I think this goes beyond the issue of just compensation. "This is an issue which needs to be looked at by FIFA in terms of a coach putting a member association under some duress by not honouring a contract. There's a principle at stake that needs to be looked at." Advocaat told Sydney's Daily Telegraph that it was a difficult decision to turn his back on the Australian job but Zenit St Petersburg offered him a deal he could not refuse. "I definitely feel so sorry but at the same time you have to take a decision in life that is quite difficult to do," he told the newspaper. "I couldn't refuse this offer. It was quite a lot of money, to be honest. It was not double, it was more. Much more.
