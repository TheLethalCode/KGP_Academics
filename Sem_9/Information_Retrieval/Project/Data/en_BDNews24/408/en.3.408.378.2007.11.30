 Ankara, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com/euters) - A Turkish airliner with 56 people on board went missing in central Turkey on Friday, officials said. Turkish media said the wreckage of the plane had been found near the town of Isparta in a mountainous part of southern Turkey. No immediate comment was available from officials on the reports. The plane disappeared from radar screens shortly before it was due to land at Isparta, about 150 km (90 miles) north of the Mediterranean resort of Antalya. The plane was operated by the private AtlasJetair company whose chief executive Tuncay Doganer told the CNN Turk broadcaster there were 49 passengers and seven crew on board. The aircraft, the make of which was not immediately known, was flying from Istanbul. Turkey's state Anatolian news agency said aviation authorities lost contact with the plane early on Friday (6:36 p.m. EST on Thursday), just after the pilot said he was preparing to land at Isparta's Suleyman Demirel airport. "As the plane was approaching its descent, it sought permission to land and after receiving a positive reply from the tower contact was lost," the agency quoted local deputy governor Tayyar Sasmaz as saying. Police and emergency crews had launched a search and rescue operation and a crisis desk had been set up at the airport, the agency said. Turkey is now in the grip of winter with snow and fog common on higher ground across much of the country.
