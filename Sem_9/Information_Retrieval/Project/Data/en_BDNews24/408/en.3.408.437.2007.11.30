 Dhaka, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com)  Police halted a protest in the city's Shahbagh area Friday against a controversial government decision to transport archeological relics for an exhibition in Paris. Over a hundred students of Dhaka University's Institute of Fine Arts formed a human chain in front of the National Museum at about 10am holding a banner that read: "Stop smuggling the country's artifacts." Police asked the protesters to leave the area triggering a war of words. Two protesters were picked up from the scene, but released later in the afternoon. When contacted by bdnews24.com, a teacher of the Institute of Fine Arts said that the National Museum authorities had not abided by international rules in preparing to transport the artifacts out of the country. "No list of the artifacts being sent to France was published either," said the teacher, not wishing to be named. He demanded a fair investigation into the matter. Forty-five of the artifacts in question are reportedly from the National Museum, 118 from the Department of Archaeology Bangladesh and 24 from Varendra Research Museum. The High Court issued a stay order on Sept 17 on sending 187 archeological relics to Paris, after a public interest litigation was filed. The Supreme Court suspended the High Court stay order on Oct 4. The litigation, brought by seven members of the public, said that the government had moved to export the unique archaeological finds at undue risk without ensuring proper insurance value. The litigators also alleged the government had appointed a protocol officer previously found "guilty of corruption and smuggling antiquities." Lawyers argued that the process of sending the items for exhibition was part of a conspiracy for private dealers to grab the precious antiquities. They also mentioned that the government had issued a memo on July 31 stating that the cultural affairs secretary had signed an agreement with the French ambassador in Bangladesh to transport the items. "The cultural affairs secretary is not legally authorised to enter such an agreement against the national interest," lawyers had argued. bdn
