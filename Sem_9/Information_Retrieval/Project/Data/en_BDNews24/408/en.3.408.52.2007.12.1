 Dhaka, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com) - The national cricketers, under the supervision of new coach Jamie Siddons, start training camp Sunday for the coming tour of New Zealand. "I haven't seen all of our cricketers so far and hope to be introduced with them tomorrow," Australian coach Siddons told reporters Saturday at Nayaranganj Osmani Stadium during the National Cricket League's one-day match between Rajshahi and Sylhet. Bangladesh will play a three-match ODI and a two-Test series against the Kiwis in December-January. ".... I feel happy after being informed that a couple of batsmen were performing well in the domestic league," said Siddons adding that he would carry out different practice sets. "I will definitely try to put on something new, but prior to I first want to know what the cricketers expect from me," said former Australian's assistant coach, who watched the Khulna-Dhaka four-dayer for two days in Khulna. The Tigers will undergo only fitness testing Sunday at the Sher-e-Bangla Indoor complex in Mirpur. The nine-day training camp has been divided into two parts with skills and fitness training at one end and match scenarios at the other end. The Tigers will leave here for New Zealand on Dec 12. Siddons said he hoped they would be ready to take on New Zealand. "We are getting at least 20 days and a few practice matches before our first official match against New Zealand, and I think the preparation will not be a bad one," said the 43-year old coach.
