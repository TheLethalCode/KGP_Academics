 LONDON, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil surged more than $3 a barrel on Thursday after an explosion on a major pipeline cut crude oil imports to top consumer the United States by nearly a fifth. US crude jumped $3.25 to $93.87 a barrel by 1009 GMT, off a session high of $95.17. Brent crude leapt $1.93 to $91.74 a barrel.

The pipelines carry an estimated 1.9 million barrels per day (bpd) of Canadian crude to the United States, a fifth of US imports.

One of the set of four pipelines will require repairs and regulator inspections, while the largest is "not likely" to start up soon, an Enbridge spokesman said.

A Reuters poll of 21 banks, funds, consultants and traders showed a majority expecting OPEC to increase output by at least 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) when it meets. Top OPEC Gulf officials have expressed concern about oil's record run, but insist supplies are sufficient and do not support prices near $1
