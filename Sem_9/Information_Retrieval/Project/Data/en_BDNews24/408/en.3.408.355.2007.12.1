 Sylhet, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com)  Tangail DSA held Mohammedan Sporting Club to a goalless draw in the second fund-raising match for Sidr victims at Tangail Stadium Saturday. The 90-minute match was reduced to 65 minutes because Mohammedan arrived late in the first match against Sylhet on Friday. Some 10000-strong crowd enjoyed the game as both sides had some national booters. Muktijoddha Sangsad's goalie Aminul Islam, Arman Aziz and striker Alfaz Ahmed played for the popular black and white outfit. Tangail consisted of Brothers Union goalkeeper Mohammad Ali, Muktijoddha winger Saiful Islam Saif, Farashganj medio Kabir and Tutul along with the local guys. Former Mohammedan defender Kaiser Hamid also played for his old outfit. "Except scoring goal, both sides played an entertaining match," Mohammedan coach Shafiqul Islam Manik told bdnews24.com by phone. "We missed the target for three to four times though the opponents failed to cash in on an open chance," said Manik.
