 MADRID, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid cannot afford to relax despite needing only a point to qualify from Group C of the Champions League, warned striker Raul. The nine-times European champions lost 3-2 at Werder Bremen on Wednesday but remain top of the group and will progress to the last 16 if they avoid defeat to bottom side Lazio in the Bernabeu on Dec. 11. "We're well aware that if we beat Lazio we qualify and finish top of the group, but it is a very dangerous match," Raul said. "We're convinced we won't slip up at home but we need to be focused." The captain's warning came after his side missed their second chance to ensure qualification. Last time out they were held 0-0 away to Olympiakos Piraeus when three points would have effectively seen them through. But while Real have not won in their last four away games in all competitions, they have a 100 percent record at home in the Primera Liga and Champions League. Raul's strike partner, Dutchman Ruud van Nistelrooy, was confident Real would advance. "We didn't play well and it's clear that we have been having problems away from home recently," he said. "The good thing is the last game is at home where we have been winning all our games and we'll have the support of our own fans. We'll do it at the third attempt.
