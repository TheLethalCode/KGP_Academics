<TITLE> Excessive CT scans pose radiation risk: US doctors </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BOSTON, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - They save lives and speed diagnosis but the 62 million CT scans done in the United States each year may soon be responsible for 2 percent of all cancers, two researchers said on Wednesday. Because doctors underestimate the radiation risk from computed tomography or CT scans, a type of souped-up X-ray, they may be ordering too many of the scans, David Brenner and Eric Hall of Columbia University Medical Center in New York said. They also said a straw poll of physicians has suggested that perhaps one-third of the scans may be unnecessary or could be replaced by an alternative technique, such as ultrasound. "If it is true that about one-third of all CT scans are not justified by medical need, and it appears to be likely, perhaps 20 million adults and, crucially, more than 1 million children per year in the United States are being irradiated unnecessarily," they wrote in a commentary in the New England Journal of Medicine. But they acknowledged in a telephone briefing that the assertion is a "back of the envelope" estimate based on the impressions of doctors. They said no study has tried to gauge the problem of unnecessary CT scans. A typical CT scan can deliver 50 to 100 times more radiation than a conventional X-ray, depending on the site being examined and the age and brand of the machine. Children have a higher risk from the scans because their tissues are at least 10 times more sensitive to radiation. In addition, long-term side effects have more time to appear. "We were astonished to find when we were researching material for this paper how many doctors, particularly emergency room physicians, really had no idea of the magnitude of the doses or the potential risk that it would involve," said Hall. "It has been estimated that about 0.4 percent of all cancers in the United States may be attributable to the radiation from CT studies. By adjusting this estimate for current CT use, this estimate might now be in the range of 1.5 to 2.0 percent" once tumors from current exposures begin to appear, they wrote. Brenner and Hall said ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, scans should be used instead of CT scans whenever practical. CT scans are particularly overused in looking for childhood appendicitis, they said. Other solutions may include developing systems for discouraging doctors from performing unnecessary CT scans, reusing scans if patients are sent to another doctor or hospital, and urging patients -- or their parents -- to ask about the radiation risk involved in a CT scan, a question that, in itself, is likely to make doctors think twice. But Fred Mettler of the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque said one reason doctors are quick to order a CT scan is that it can quickly spot a variety of potential problems that could be missed by other tests. "It's a huge efficiency issue," Mettler told reporters on the briefing. Nonetheless, "I've seen people who are 30 years old who had at least 18 scans done. So this is a big problem," he said.
