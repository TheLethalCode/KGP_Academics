 FRANKFURT, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares traded higher by midday on Friday as financial stocks continued to rebound, lifted by comments from the US Federal Reserve, which signalled a possible interest rate cut in December. By 1127 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 0.9 percent at 1,522.42 points, after rising to 1,523.7, its highest in two weeks. "The mood has lightened up again," said Carsten Klude, chief economist M M Warburg. "What's driving the markets at the moment is primarily the expectation that the Fed will cut rates on Dec. 11 and that it will help the recovery of the financial sector," he added. Markets had already priced in a rate cut of 25 basis points, Klude said, adding he could also imagine a 50 basis point cut. By the end of next year, Klude expects the benchmark federal funds rate at between 3 percent to 3.5 percent from 4.5 percent now, he said. Fed chairman Ben Bernanke said late on Thursday that a resurgence in financial strains in recent weeks had dimmed the outlook for the U.S. economy and that the Fed would have to remain "exceptionally alert and flexible". Financial stocks, which bore the brunt in a credit crisis stemming from a meltdown in the U.S. subprime mortgages market, continued a rebound in which they have gained around 4 percent this week, helped by the acquisition of a state in Citigroup by Abu Dhabi. UBS, Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays all rose almost 3 percent each. The outlook on strong global economic growth also lifted mining shares with Anglo American up 3.9 percent, Xstrata up 2.8 percent and Rio Tinto up 1.8 percent. "For mining stocks the music's playing in emerging markets and so far there is little news about a growth slowdown in this area," Klude said. MINIMUM WAGE SUPPORTS A deal on minimum wages in the German mail sector, which the German government struck on Thursday, led shares like Deutsche Post 2.9 percent higher. Analysts said this would increase competitors' personnel expenses by 25 percent on average. Dutch mail company rival TNT NV added 3.7 percent. On the downside, retail shares were among the strongest decliners in weightage terms with Metro down 1.8 percent, Marks & Spencer down 1.1 percent and Tesco down 0.2 percent. Economic data showed earlier on Friday Euro zone inflation jumped more than expected in November to its highest in six and a half years, while economic sentiment worsened. German retail sales also fell by a much bigger-than-expected 3.3 percent on the month in real terms in October. Data on Thursday showed that Germany's labour market continued to recover with jobless total falling sharply to the lowest level in more than a decade in November. "We have an improvement in the labour market, but rising inflation negates this development as real earnings don't rise," Klude said. "Hope that consumption contributes stronger to economic growth doesn't bear fruit," he add
