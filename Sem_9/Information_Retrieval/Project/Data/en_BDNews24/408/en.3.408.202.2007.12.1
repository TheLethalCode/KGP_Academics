 Gazipur, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com)  Law adviser Mainul Hosein Saturday rubbished the notion that public discussion on the affairs of political parties was off-limits. "Any person can talk about the constitution of any political party." "It cannot be that democracy prevails in the country but not in the political parties," he said to reporters. Mainul said different laws related to land were being amended in order to bring transparency to and modernise the country's land management. The adviser spoke to reporters Saturday after launching a 42-day land survey and training programme for Bangladesh Civil Service (BCS) cadres and judicial officers at the Telecommunications Staff College in Gazipur. "Every inch of land in this country requires deliberate use. It is essential in light of the size of the country and increasing rate of population." "Land related complications will be resolved if these initiatives are taken," he added. bdnews24.
