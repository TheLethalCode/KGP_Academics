 Dhaka, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com)The US government will provide an additional $5 million (Tk 35 crore) for the cyclone-affected people of Bangladesh, raising the its contribution to over $19.5 million. "The US government through the US agency for international development (USAID) will provide 5 million dollars to the World Food Programme for the emergency operation in Bangladesh," a USAID statement said Friday. The announcement of the additional funding came a day after WFP announced it would feed 22 lakh (2.2 million) Sidr survivors for the next six months to prevent malnutrition. Following rapid assessment after Sidr struck, a USAID team of experts stressed that the cyclone-hit must be provided with potable water, food and shelter on an urgent basis.
