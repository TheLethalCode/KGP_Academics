 Barguna, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com)  More than two weeks after Sidr battered Bargunathe site of recent protests by aid-starved survivorsvillagers poured out their hearts to bdnews24.com correspondent Abu Noman Sajib, complaining of a lack of relief supplies and inadequacies in the distribution of aid. "The storm swept away everything. We eat on a banana leaf because there are no plates. I have received just two kilogrammes of rice so far. The union chairman has not come to see us. That was why I took part in the procession," said Abdul Khaleque of Khajurtala, Gourichanna. Villagers from two Gourichanna union villages staged protests for relief on Wednesday and Thursday, claiming their UP chairmen and members had neglected to supply relief materials since Cyclone Sidr struck on Nov 15. The elderly Abdul Kuddus Khan, from Khajurtala, said: "The chairman has not visited us once since the storm wrecked our village. Relief supplies were being handed out in his village, but what we received was totally inadequate. We got nothing. So I joined the protest." Gourichanna UP chairman Abdullah Bachchu Khan admitted that relief was inadequate. He blamed insufficient supplies of relief materials for the problem. Bachchu also admitted that he could not visit all areas of the union and said that it was impossible to enter many villages due to fallen trees on the road. Besides, he said, he was busy receiving aid allocations from the district council. He ruled out allegations of nepotism and partisanship in the distribution of relief materials, saying his opponents were carrying out propaganda against him. Barguna district deputy commissioner Altaf Hossain said: "We are being guided by damage assessments in allocating relief materials among union councils. But there is no arrangement to monitor relief distribution." Altaf said specific allegations would be investigated. Sushil Howladar of Padma village, Naltona union, said he received only 4 kg of rice since the storm hit the area. "They did not bring supplies to us; I had to walk four miles up to Babuganj Bazar for the rice," Sushil said. Naltona UP chairman Sultan Mahmud could not be contacted; his mobile phone was switched off. Md Minhazuddin of Dakhkhin Patakata village said he received only one and half kilogrammes of rice. He alleged that the chairman and members were busy with their party men. Bellal Hossain of the same village alleged that influential villagers had "gobbled up" relief materials among themselves. As the same story is heard repeated among numerous cyclone survivors in the area, claims of inadequate and unequal aid distribution continues to dog the relief effort. bdnews
