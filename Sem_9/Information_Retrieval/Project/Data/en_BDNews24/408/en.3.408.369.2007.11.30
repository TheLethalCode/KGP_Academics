 Chittagong, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com)Against the backdrop of the increasing demand for fertiliser, production at Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Ltd -- the largest urea producing plant in the country -- has remained suspended for the last 19 days, bdnews24.com correspondent Ruhul Amin Rana reported Friday from Chittagong. The plant, which supplies fertiliser to at least 22 southern districts, was shutdown on Nov 11 due to maintenance work being undertaken along the Bakhrabad gas supply line. Since then the national production loss in fertiliser has amounted on average to 1,500 metric tonnes a day. CUFL managing director Nazim Uddin told bdnews24.com: "We began operations again on Nov 18, as the gas line was repaired. But glitches in the plant's reformer stopped production again." "BCIC (Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation) and Chinese engineers and technicians are working hard to mend the plant's malfunctions," the MD said. "It may take another 4-5 days to render the factory productive again." "The government may have to import fertiliser in case we seriously fail to make up for the lost production," Nazim said. General manager Md Shah Jahan said the plant had failed to produce about 46,000 MT of fertiliser since July due to gas supply crises. "If the gas supply situation doesn't improve and the plant fails to meet its production target of 4.4 lakh MT, CUFL will face considerable financial loss," the GM said. "And the government will have to import the required fertiliser at a acost of more than Tk 100 crore." He believed it would be possible to meet immediate demands during the ongoing season with the existing stock of 28,000 MT of fertiliser. Jamal Hossain, the CUFL union's general secretary, was concerned that the workers would be deprived of the five percent bonus for fulfilling the production target, if the current stalemate isn't taken care of urgently. Not wanting to be named, a CUFL official told bdnews24.com the factory has suffered about 300-350 MT production loss daily since the start of the year due to gas supply glitches alone. He warned that other sensitive machine components may be seriously affected if the current gas pressure fluctuations continue. The fertiliser plant requires around 50 million cubic feet of gas daily to sustain its production smoothly. It was receiving only 44-47 mn cft, plant officials added. bdnews24.c
