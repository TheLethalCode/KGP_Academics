 PESHAWAR, Pakistan, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's former prime minister Benazir Bhutto took her election campaign to the power base of Islamist groups on Saturday, urging Pashtuns living on the Afghan border to vote for her. Bhutto, who survived an assassination attempt blamed on Islamist militants last month, said she was confident her Pakistan People's Party would sweep the Jan. 8 general election. "I have come here to seek your help and cooperation to turn this land of Pashtuns into a cradle of peace," she said while addressing around 2,000 party activists in Peshawar, the capital of North West Frontier Province that borders Afghanistan. "I appeal to you not to fall into the trap of those who believe in violence ... Reject those who want to form the government at gunpoint." Bhutto returned to Pakistan last month from an eight year self-imposed exile to challenge President Pervez Musharraf's grip on power. Musharraf's political allies are likely to fare badly in the election, putting a question mark over his long-term rule. Pakistani tribal areas along the border are known as safe havens for al Qaeda and ethnic Pashtun Taliban militants who fled US-led forces hunting them in Afghanistan following the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. But in recent years, militants have spread their activities towards urban centres of NWFP, including Peshawar, launching suicide bomb attacks and fighting police and army forces. Since government forces stormed the Red Mosque in the capital Islamabad in July to crush a Taliban-style movement, attacks have spread across the country and grown in intensity. Official sources say around 800 people have died in violence since July. BOYCOTT POSSIBLE Oxford and Harvard educated Bhutto had been regarded in the West as a potential partner for Musharraf, a crucial US ally in its fight against al Qaeda, but prospects for a power-sharing deal dimmed after Musharraf imposed emergency rule on Nov. 3. Musharraf retired from the army this week and promised to lift emergency rule on Dec. 16, fulfilling two of Bhutto's demands. But there are no signs they are resuming dialogue. She also wants the Election Commission reconstituted and local government leaders suspended to ensure a fair vote. "We are taking part in the election under protest because enemies of the people are trying to rig the polls," she said. Bhutto has left open the option of joining another former prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, who returned from exile on Sunday, in a boycott. Sharif, who might be barred from running because of criminal convictions he says were politically motivated, will meet Bhutto on Monday to convince her to boycott, a party spokesman said. Sharif's brother Shahbaz was barred from running by election officials on Saturday, citing financial irregularities. Party officials complained of victimisation and said they would appeal. A united opposition boycott would rob the vote of credibility and prolong instability. A boycott involving only Sharif and his allies, including the second biggest religious party and the small party of former cricket hero Imran Khan, would merely tarnish the election.
