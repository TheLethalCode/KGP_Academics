<TEXT>
 LONDON, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British Foreign Secretary David Miliband is to summon the Sudanese ambassador in London after a British teacher in Sudan was charged with insulting religion. "We are surprised and disappointed by this development and the foreign secretary will summon as a matter of urgency the Sudanese ambassador to discuss this matter further," a spokesman for Prime Minister Gordon Brown said on Wednesday. British teacher Gillian Gibbons, who was detained in Sudan after her class called a teddy bear Mohammad, was on Wednesday charged with insulting religion. "The first step is to summon the Sudanese ambassador so we can get a clear explanation for the rationale behind these charges and I think we'll consider our response in the light of that," he said. "We have to establish what the rationale is for the arrest before deciding the next step. Once the foreign secretary has met the Sudanese ambassador we'll consider further steps."
