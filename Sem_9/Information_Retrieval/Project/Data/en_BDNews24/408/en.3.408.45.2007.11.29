 Dhaka, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court dealing with high-profile corruption cases Thursday sentenced film actor and ward commissioner Monwar Hossain Dipjal to eight years in jail for tax evasion. Judge Amar Kumar Roy of Special Judge's Court-2 set up at the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban also fined Dipjal Tk 3.5 crore and said the convict will face another six months in jail on failure to pay. The court also ordered confiscation of his assets amounting to Tk 12 crore. The sentence comes into force from the day of Dipjal's arrest or surrender, as he has so far evaded arrest. The actor got five years for concealing wealth information and three years for falsifying his income tax statement. Dipjal, in effect, will have to serve eight years behind bars as the sentences will run simultaneously. On July 26, he was sentenced to 17 years in jail for illegal possession of arms and ammunition. He and wife Romana were both sentenced to seven years on Aug 20 in a separate arms case. Romana is currently serving her sentence in jail. The National Board of Revenue filed the tax-dodge case against Dipjal with the Metropolitan Senior Special Judge's Court for Dhaka on Sept 18. The court issued an arrest warrant against him the same day. According to case details, Dipjal concealed asset information of Tk 12 crore from tax years 1998-99 and 2006-7 and evaded paying Tk 26 lakh in taxes. Charges were framed in the Special Judge's Court on Oct 18 and 61 witnesses testified until Nov 21. bdnews24.com
