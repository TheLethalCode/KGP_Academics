 RAIPUR, India, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Maoist rebels set off a landmine in eastern India on Thursday killing 10 policemen travelling in a jeep, an official said. The attack took place in the rebel-infested Dantewada district of Chhattisgarh, the worst-hit among about a dozen states where Maoist insurgents are active. "The powerful blast ripped through the jeep, killing all 10 policemen," police officer Rahul Sharma said by phone, adding that several people, including villagers, could be injured. Maoist militants control large rural swathes across eastern, central and southern India and say they are fighting for the rights of poor peasants and landless labourers. The rebels are active in at least 13 of India's 29 states and the conflict has killed thousands of people in recent years.
