 Dhaka, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com)  Opener Nafis Iqbal smashed unbeaten century Wednesday to keep Chittagong in the hunt against visitors Barisal at the close of the second day of the sixth-round four-dayer of the National Cricket League. Chittagong were 270 for four at stumps in reply to Barisal's 293 all out in the first innings at Bir Shrestha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium in Chittagong. Holders Dhaka were struggling at 173 for six at stumps after restricting Khulna to 253 all out at Bir Shrestha Shaheed Motiur Rahman Stadium in Khulna. Riding on two centuries from Farhad Hossain and Anisur Rahman, Rajshahi posted a mammoth 417 all out in the first innings against Sylhet, who were 88 for one at the close of second day at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. Chittagong v Barisal Nafis also scored a scintillating 118 not out off 222 balls, including 16 fours after his partner Gazi Salahuddin fell on 17. He shared a 99-run partnership with Nazimuddin (57) for the second wicket and added another 78 runs with skipper Ehsanul Haq (42) for the fourth wicket to take Chittagong to a strong position. Dhaka v Khulna Khulna, having resumed the day on 239 for seven, were all out for 253 as Dhaka pacer Mahbubul Alam made a light work of the tailenders in the morning. The visitors, however, failed to keep the momentum and struggled all day long in the face of some tight bowling from Khulna. Despite losing opener Al Shahriar Rokon on one, Dhaka were 113 for three at a stage, but they slipped to 140 for six as Mahsrafee Bin Mortaza (2/27) and Saqib Al Hasan (2/27) took two wickets each. Mahmudullah defied the Khulna bowlers for nearly four hours before he was caught behind the wicket off Saqib for 51 off 144 balls. Dhaka, still trailing by 80 runs, will resume the third day with Nadif Chowdhury on 27 and Anwar Hossain on 14. Rajshahi v Sylhet After Farhad Hossain and Anisur Rahman laid the foundation with two centuries on the first day, Farhad Reza (55), Khaled Mashud (33) and Mohammad Shahajada (32) consolidated day to take Rajshahi beyond 400-mark. Left-arm spinner Enamul Haq Junior captured four wickets for 107 but could not stop marauding Rajshahi batsmen, who added 161 runs to their overnight total of 256 for four. Sylhet also responded well in the afternoon to end the day with 88 for one thanks to a stroke-filled 65 from opener Imtiaz Hossain, who clubbed 14 boundaries. b
