 Dhaka, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh has turned down an Indian proposal to send helicopters for relief and rehabilitation operations to cyclone-hit areas, the Indian foreign minister said Saturday. "We offered [the Bangladesh government] helicopters for relief operations if necessary. But they said it was not necessary," visiting Indian external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee told reporters at a press briefing at the Radisson Water Gardens Hotel. He declined to comment on the arrival of US warships in the Bay of Bengal. "That is for Bangladesh to decide. Who am I to comment?" Pranab said in response to reporters' questions about his reactions to the presence of US warships in the Bay of Bengal. The Indian foreign minister visited the Sidr-struck area of Sarankhola in Bagerhat district, following talks with chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed and foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury. bdnew
