 KOLKATA, India, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India ran up an imposing first-innings total of 616 for five declared on the second day and grabbed an early wicket to take a grip on the second test against Pakistan on Saturday. Vangipurappu Laxman and Saurav Ganguly joined Wasim Jaffer in the list of centurions before Anil Kumble trapped Yasir Hameed lbw to leave the visitors at 50 for one at stumps. Opener Salman Butt and stand-in captain Younis Khan were at the crease on 26 and three respectively when poor light stopped play. Laxman struck 112 not out after Ganguly followed Jaffer's double hundred with his first century in his home ground to pile on the agony for Pakistan. Left-hander Ganguly cracked 102 and shared in a 163-run stand for the fifth wicket with Laxman after opener Jaffer (202) fell shortly after reaching his double century. Jaffer, on 192 overnight, struck two boundaries off fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar to achieve the second double hundred of his career in style after the hosts resumed at 352 for three. Jaffer, who shared in two century partnerships on Friday, was caught by Kamran Akmal off Sohail Tanvir's first ball of the day.

Ganguly, playing in his 98th test, drove fluently and punched hard for his first test century in his home ground and his first against Pakistan. His 156-ball knock was studded with 14 boundaries. Laxman, who scored 72 not out in his team's six-wicket victory in the first test, struck 15 boundaries, the pick of which was a delectable flick off Shoaib through mid-wicket. Ganguly reached his century, also his first against Pakistan, with a single past mid-off off leg spinner Danish Kaneria, who bowled tirelessly as a swelling Eden Gardens crowd roared in celebration. Former captain Ganguly was caught at short long-off by Tanvir giving part-time spinner Butt the charge. Laxman reached his century with a single off Shoaib during his 78-run stand for the unfinished sixth wicket with Mahendra Dhoni, who blasted a fifty
