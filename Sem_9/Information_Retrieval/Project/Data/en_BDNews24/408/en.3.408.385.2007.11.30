 AMSTERDAM, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Dutch government decided on Friday to keep troops in the south of Afghanistan, where they are serving as part of a NATO force, until 2010. The cabinet opted to extend the troops' mandate in Uruzgan province which is in the front-line of the battle between NATO's 40,000-strong peacekeeping force and Taliban insurgents. The Dutch government had come under conflicting pressure from NATO to extend its mission and from the Dutch public worried about increasing casualties. "The cabinet has agreed to keep troops in Afghanistan until 2010," a government spokesman said. Parliament must now give final approval. The Netherlands has between 1,500 to 1,700 soldiers in Afghanistan, whose mandate was due to expire in August 2008. Twelve Dutch soldiers have died in Afghanistan, including one suicide. Afghanistan has been hit by an increase in violence this year and as many as 5,000 people have been killed since January. "NATO welcomes this decision by the Dutch cabinet which is a demonstration of the continuing commitment to this mission and to the Afghan people," NATO spokesman James Appathurai said. Last month NATO's commander in Afghanistan said NATO was taking a risk by not sending enough troops to Afghanistan and restrictions on the deployment of some countries' soldiers hampered operations. The United States has said it wants more NATO countries to get involved in the heavy fighting against Taliban forces in the south and east of Afghanistan, a task done mainly by US, British, Dutch and Canadian troops.
