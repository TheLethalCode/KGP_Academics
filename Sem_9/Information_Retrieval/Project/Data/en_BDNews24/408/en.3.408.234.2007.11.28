<TITLE> Nobel literature winner Lessing to miss ceremony </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 STOCKHOLM, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British novelist Doris Lessing, winner of the 2007 Nobel Prize for literature, will not attend the prize ceremony in Stockholm in December, the Nobel Foundation said on Wednesday. "Doris Lessing has been ill for some time but had very much hoped to be able to come to Stockholm. Unfortunately her medical advisers have said that she must not travel," the foundation said in a statement. Lessing will instead pre-record the annual Nobel literature lecture, which will be aired at the Swedish Academy on Dec. 7. The 87-year-old will receive her prize in London. Although Turkish writer Orhan Pamuk, the 2006 literature laureate, attended the glittering Nobel Week festivities in Stockholm, the two winners before him -- Austrian novelist Elfriede Jelinek in 2004 and British playwright Harold Pinter in 2005 -- had to give the ceremony a miss. Lessing won the 10 million Swedish crown ($1.81 million) prize for a body of work that looked unflinchingly at society's ills and inspired a generation of feminist writers.
