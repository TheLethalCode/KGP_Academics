 Dhaka, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com)  A suspected narcotics peddler died in custody at the Department of Narcotics Control Saturday, his relatives alleged. Roni Islam Ramzan, 25, who was arrested Wednesday by the officials of the department at his home in Old Dhaka, died in Rashmano Hospital at about 10.45am. Roni's relatives alleged he was tortured to death. DNC officials denied the allegation saying Ramzan was injured after he jumped out of an upper storey window to flee. The Department of Narcotics Control filed an unnatural death case with Ramna Police Station, Ramna police chief Dowlat Akbar told bdnews24.com by phone. Pappu Islam, Ramzan's younger brother, said Ramzan had a cosmetics business in Chawk Bazar. He left home Wednesday after an argument with his mother over his sister's wedding before he was arrested, Pappu said. "They (the officials) made him walk with them. He was not sick at all. People of the area witnessed it. Now they are saying that he jumped from an upstairs window. They beat my brother to death." Roni's mother Anwara alleged the same. Roni's wife is pregnant. Selim Reza Shyamol, who works at the front desk of Rashmano Hospital, said Roni was admitted at 4am Wednesday with respiratory problems. He had suffered head injuries, Reza said. DNC deputy director Fazlur Rahman said his department raided a house in Islambagh in Lalbagh on information that liquor was produced there. DNC Gulshan zone inspector Helaluddin Bhuiyan led the raid. They seized 25 bottles of liquor from the house, 23 empty bottles of liquor and two litres of rectified spirit. After a primary investigation, Roni was taken to the police station at about 7pm. He jumped out of the van and ran to a 10-storey building and jumped from the second floor, Fazlur Rahman claimed. He was rushed to Dhaka Medical College Hospital and was later transferred to Rashmano Hospital in line with the advice of DMCH doctors for his treatment in the Intensive Care Unit. bdnews24.
