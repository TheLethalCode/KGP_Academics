<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com)  A committee of freedom fighters Saturday demanded the trial of war criminals in a special tribunal, an end to the distortion of history of the liberation war and a ban on religion-based politics. The demands were raised at a discussion meeting organised by the Committee for the Implementation of Freedom Fighters' Demands and the Observation of Freedom Fighters' Day. The discussion was part of events to mark Freedom Fighters' Day, observed on Dec 1. Former army chief retired major general KM Shafiullah presided over the meeting. AL presidium member Abdur Razzak said: "We have placed a number of demands. But why must we make demands? We continue to struggle today for the implementation of the spirit of the liberation war. "Those who do not accept the independence of Bangladesh are amidst us." "Those who do not accept the country's independence are enemies to the country. They should be tried right away." Tofail Ahmed, another member of the AL's policymaking wing, said, "Late president Ziaur Rahman facilitated anti-liberation forces' politics by amending the constitution." He asked the government to take steps against those still speaking against the liberation war. Referring to law adviser Mainul Hosein's remarks that 'Those who did not try war criminals in the last 36 years should be tried first', Rashed Khan Menon, the Workers Party president said, "The remark raises the question of which side they are on?" Earlier the freedom fighters paid their respects at the Shikha Chironton at Suhrawardy Udyan. bdnews24
