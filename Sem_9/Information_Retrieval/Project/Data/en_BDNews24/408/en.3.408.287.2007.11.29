 MANILA, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Philippine government said on Thursday it would impose a curfew from midnight to 5 a m in the capital Manila and two surrounding regions. Interior Secretary Ronaldo Puno said the curfew was being imposed to ensure law and order after security forces foiled a coup bid by renegade soldiers, and would hopefully only be in place for one. Philippine president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo said on Thursday renegade soldiers arrested after a botched coup bid would be charged shortly.
