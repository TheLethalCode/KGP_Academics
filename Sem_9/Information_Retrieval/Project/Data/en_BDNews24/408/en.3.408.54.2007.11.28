 RIYADH, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Saudi Arabia said on Wednesday it had arrested 208 people for involvement in several cells planning attacks on an oil installation as well as clerics and security forces. The state television said one of the cells was planning to smuggle missiles into the country, which has faced a campaign by al Qaeda sympathisers since 2003 against the US-allied monarchy. A cell of eight militants led by a foreigners planned an attack on an oil facility in the Eastern Province, home to key oil installation in the world's largest oil exporting nation. The report, citing an Interior Ministry statement, said 18 of those arrested belonged to a cell led by an "expert in launching missiles" who had infiltrated into the country. Another 22 were part of a group that plotted to assassinate clerics and security forces, it said. It also said the arrests included a "media cell" of 16 in Medina which aimed to promote "takfiri" ideology -- the idea that supports violence against Muslims branded as infidels and apostates.
