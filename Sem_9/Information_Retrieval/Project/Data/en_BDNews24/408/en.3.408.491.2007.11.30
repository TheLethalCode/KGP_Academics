 Dhaka, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong took sweet revenge on Brisal in the National Cricket League when they handed a convincing seven-wicket defeat to the visitors in the return-leg four-dayer Friday. At the Bir Shrestha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium in Chittagong, the hosts raced to 137 for three on the fourth and final day, chasing a winning target of 134 set by Barisal, who defeated Chittagong by five wickets at Shaheed Chandhu Stadium in Bogra in the first-leg. League leaders Khulna with first innings lead drew against Dhaka at Bir Shrestha Shaheed Motiur Rahman Stadium after the first leg-leg match between them also ended in a draw in Dhaka. Rajshahi with first innings lead drew with Sylhet, who lost their first-leg match to the last year's runners-up by five wickets, at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. After the sixth round, Khulna consolidated their lead with 72, five points clear of second-placed Rajshahi, who have 67 points after securing 12 points from the sixth round match. Holders Dhaka have one point more than Chittagong, who toppled Barisal to take up the fourth position with a second straight win to raise their point tally to 53. Sylhet remained at the bottom of the six-team point table with 33 from six outings. Chittagong vs Barisal Chittagong faced no trouble in tasting their second straight triumph as openers Gazi Salahuddin and Nafis Iqbal provided the hosts a solid foundation of 76 runs for the opening stand before the latter was run out for 25. Salahuddin later followed Nafis to be caught by Barisal skipper Shahriar Nafees off Arafat Salahuddin for a stroke-filled 60 off 71 that clubbed 11 boundaries. Dhiman Gosh (33 off 28 balls) and Aftab Ahmed (run-a-ball two) remained unbeaten to steer Chittaogng home. Earlier, Barisal having resumed the final day on 117 for seven, added 75 runs to finish the second innings at 192 all out, giving the port city to chase 134 runs to win. Tailenders Arafat Salahuddin (31) and Sajedul Islam (37) kept Chittagong bowlers at bay after putting on 69 runs for the eighth wicket playing the first session, but the fall of the eight- wicket stand prompted Barisal's second innings collapse with losing the last three batsmen in seven runs. Pacer Tareq Aziz raised his wicket tally to three for 58 after two of the three wickets. Khulna vs Dhaka Khulna declared their second innings on 327 for five to set Dhaka to chase an improbable 377 to win after Saqib Al Hasan reached his second league century. Khulna, who resumed the day on 288 for five, declared their innings as soon as Saqib took his overnight 82 to 103. Dhaka skipper Mohammad Ashraful (67) and Shamsur Rahman (51 not out) denied the Khulna bowlers to finish the day with 275 for four. Rajshahi vs Sylhet Rajshahi set Sylhet to chase an improbable target of 353 to win and Sylhet finished the final day with 19 for two in 3.4 overs after Rajshahi pacer Farhad Hossain removed both batsmen. Resuming the second innings on 24 for two, Rajshahi played cautiously and almost batted daylong before being bowled out for 228, taking an overall 352-run lead. Middle order Nayeem Islam top-scored with 50 while first-innings centurion Anisur Rahman, Farhad Reza and Khaled Mashud chipped in with 47, 36 and 30 before Alok Kapali returned with five for 73. Sylhet scored 293 all out in reply to Rajshahi's first innings total of 417.
