 LONDON, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran vowed to pursue its disputed atomic programme come what may, reducing the chances that talks on Friday with the European Union would avert US pressure for tougher international sanctions against the Islamic Republic. Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki said late on Thursday that nothing would deflect the Islamic Republic from its pursuit of nuclear technology and that Washington had "lost" in its attempts to stop them. "The Iranian nation will never return from the path that they have chosen and they are determined and decisive to continue this path (to obtain nuclear technology)," Mottaki was quoted as saying by the official IRNA news agency. If there is no progress at Friday's talks in London, six world powers due to meet in Paris on Saturday will try to agree new penalties to propose to the UN despite differences in their approach to halting Irans's nuclear programme. The West says the programme is aimed at building atom bombs and wants a freeze on its enrichment of uranium. Iran, a major oil exporter, says enrichment efforts are meant only to produce electricity which it says is an inalienable right. Attempts by the six nations -- Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States -- to stall Iran's programme have failed and they vowed to pass a new UN Security Council resolution if there was no progress by December. The five permanent members of the Security Council plus Germany plan to draft a new resolution imposing wider financial, trade and visa restrictions to increase pressure on Tehran to stop enriching uranium, which can be used in atomic bombs. But diplomats and analysts say Iran will see little reason to suspend uranium enrichment given that the six powers remain at odds over how soon to resort to more United Nations penalties, or how harsh they should be. Russia and China, and to a lesser extent Germany, have close commercial ties to Iran and are likely to tailor their new sanctions proposals accordingly, taking a less hawkish approach than that of the United States, Britain and France. "America is angry with Iran over its nuclear programme but they know that the cost of attacking Iran will be very high," Mottaki told a gathering of the Basij religious militia. "America has lost in its nuclear challenge with Iran." "NOTHING HAS CHANGED" Tehran said earlier this week that Iran's chief nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili would put forward "new initiatives" to European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana in London on Friday, without giving further details. But it said there will be no talk about suspension of nuclear fuel work and Solana's spokeswoman said on Friday the European Union had nothing new to put on the table. She said they had taken note of Mottaki's comments before the meeting, that started at about 1000 GMT. "We have to see what Jalili says at the meeting ... nothing has changed." Jalili replaced Ali Larijani as chief nuclear negotiator in October. Close to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, he is seen by analysts as signalling a hardening of Iran's position. "They (Western countries) shouldn't make threats because threats make Iran more determined," former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani told worshippers at Tehran University. Rafsanjani, who is also the speaker of the powerful Assembly of Experts, said Iran was cooperating with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), referring to an August agreement under which Tehran pledged to the Vienna-based body to clear up suspicions about past secret atomic activities. Iran has barred inspections beyond uranium production sites since its case was referred to the UN Security Council in February 2006, fuelling suspicions in the West that it has a covert parallel military nuclear programme. The IAEA sees wide-ranging access to Iran's sites under its Additional Protocol with member states as key to verifying there is no such programme. "Iran has no programme to discuss the Additional Protocol at its parliament and Iran has no commitment regarding the implementation of the Additional Protocol," Mottaki sa
