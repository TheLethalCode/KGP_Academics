<TEXT>
 Barguna, November 30 (bdnews24.com) - Communications adviser and chief relief and rehabilitation coordinator MA Matin Friday warned against deriving political mileage from the distress of Sidr survivors. "Anybody attempting to capitalise on the distress of the people for political gain will be seriously dealt with. Anyone committing excesses in this regard will face arrest," he said while speaking to cyclone victims at Dhupati village, Gourichanna union, Barguna. "The government has sufficient stock of relief materials and intends to aid cyclone victims in every manner." "You don't have to take out processions to get relief. Just inform the administration and arrangements will be made to get relief to the spot," Matin told cyclone survivors on an impromptu visit to the area. Villagers from two Gourichanna union villages had staged protests for relief on Wednesday and Thursday, claiming their UP chairmen and members had neglected to supply relief materials since Cyclone Sidr struck on Nov 15. Matin said public servants found guilty of nepotism or irregularities will be excluded from relief operations. "The government has waived SSC and HSC examination fees in the disaster areas. Families in these areas will be allotted 15 kilogrammes of rice each from December through the vulnerable group feeding (VGF) cards," the adviser said. "Employment opportunities will be created by initiating test relief projects," he added. Matin distributed 10 kg of rice, potable water and a blanket to each of about 400 Sidr survivors in Dhupati. Villagers Abdul Aziz and Monwara Begum told the adviser that this was the first relief they had received after the Nov 15 cyclone. "Life doesn't stop. You must start your life anew. The government will always be there to support your struggle for survival," Matin assured them. The adviser attended a views exchange meeting at the deputy commissioner's office on his visit to the cyclone-hit Barguna district. He later visited Dhupati village and distributed relief there. Joint forces members and local administration officials were present during the adviser's relief distribution and address to villagers. bdnews24.co
