 Dhaka, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League leaders Friday denied that their party had become factionalised, pointing out the party was not divided along pro-and-anti reform or pro-and-anti Hasina lines. Awami League and Sheikh Hasina are inseparable, party leaders said at a discussion on the first death anniversary of former Dhaka city mayor and city AL chief Mohammad Hanif. AL presidium member Suranjit Sengupta, acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam and organising secretaries Saber Hossain Chowdhury and Abdul Mannan were among those present. "Our party has unitedly decided to fight the legal battle against the false cases accusing our leader (Hasina). We expect justice," Suranjit said. He criticised law adviser Mainul Hosein for saying that certain parties would not be registered unless they change their constitutions, saying: "The law adviser talks more than Election Commission officials." "He should keep in mind that according to the law only the Election Commission can talk about the registration of political parties, not the government." "Which party did he start his political career with? Doesn't he remember that he was part of a political party and became an MP? Did he become a member of that party without reading its constitution?," Suranjit said referring to Mainul. "It is the Awami League that will make reforms to the Awami League, not the government." Syed Ashraful Islam said: "The trial of Hasina must be transparent. The change of venue from one court to another raises questions," adding that the higher courts should have been overhauled long ago. "There is no alternative to unity in the party," the AL general secretary. bdnews24.
