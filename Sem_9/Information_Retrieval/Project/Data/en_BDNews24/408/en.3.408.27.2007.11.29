<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com)  US aircraft manufacturer Boeing Company has offered to sell Biman Bangladesh Airlines 12 airplanes including the latest 787 and 777 models, an official said Thursday. The Boeing 787 is a relatively fuel-efficient aircraft. Boeing has told Biman that it could supply the planes by 2011, the Biman official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to brief the media, told bdnews24.com. The Biman board of directors held a meeting Wednesday night to take a decision on the proposal but the meeting ended without any, the official added. The decision will be finalised after Biman's purchase committee gives its opinion, he said. The national flag carrier invited international tenders to buy four big planes after leasing them four months ago. Due to a lack of responses to the tender, Biman decided to deal directly with aircraft companies. Biman is planning to bankroll its new plane purchases and sell off old aircraft. A Biman source said most of its aircraft, many of which are 25-year-old vintage planes, were out of order for minor technical difficulties. The planes included five DC-10s, four Airbuses and four F-28s. bdnews2
