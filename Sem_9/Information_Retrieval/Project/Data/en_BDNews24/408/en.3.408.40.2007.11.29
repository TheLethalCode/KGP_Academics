 LONDON, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil surged by more than $4 a barrel towards $95 on Thursday, after a pipeline explosion cut crude oil imports to top consumer the United States by nearly a fifth. US crude jumped $4.10 to $94.72 a barrel by 0904 GMT, reversing the previous session's loss of $3.80. Brent crude leapt $2.74 to $92.55 a barrel.

The pipelines carry an estimated 1.9 million barrels per day (bpd) of Canadian crude to the United States, a fifth of US imports. "This is a fast reaction to the accident, and it will be good news for bull players," said Tetsu Emori of Astmax Futures.

One of the set of four pipelines will require repairs and regulator inspections, while the largest is "not likely" to start up soon, an Enbridge spokesman said.

A Reuters poll of 21 banks, funds, consultants and traders showed a majority expecting OPEC to increase output by at least 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) when it meets. Top OPEC Gulf officials have expressed concern about oil's record run, but insist supplies are sufficient and do not support prices near $1
