 LIVERPOOL, England, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez said Wednesday's precious 4-1 Champions League win over Porto would change nothing in his dealings with the club's American owners. Benitez has been at odds with Tom Hicks and George Gillett over transfer policy but said he had no personal problems with the two men. Gillett and Hicks arrive in England for a planned meeting on Dec. 16 with Benitez, who was given the fans' backing at Anfield on Wednesday with many joining a march to the ground to show their support and singing his name during the game. Benitez denied suggestions he was getting too big for his boots and did not believe Wednesday's emphatic win would improve his bargaining power in his discussions with the owners. "I have heard things said about it being my ego," he told a news conference. "But it is not about my ego, it's about my responsibility. "And I don't think this game has made my position any weaker or stronger. I'm in the same position and have the same ideas as I had before." As for his rapport with the Americans, he said: "I don't have any personal problems with the owners George Gillett or Tom Hicks. We need to talk about the future and we will see what happens. TEAM RESPONSIBILITY "I have been trying to look after my team and I need to do that because it is my responsibility. "It would be easy not to say anything and take my wages at the end of the month, but it is my club and my responsibility." Wednesday's win means Liverpool need a victory in their final Group A game at Olympique Marseille to reach the last 16. Porto coach Jesualdo Ferreira saw his game plan wrecked when striker Fernando Torres scored his second goal in the 78th minute, giving Liverpool a 2-1 lead soon after the Portuguese coach had made attack-minded substitutions. "We played a good first half and after 25 minutes of the second half we played well," he said. "In the first half Porto were much the better team and it was hard for them to come forward as we passed the ball well. "I changed and sent on Raul Meireles to try and push forward more and it coincided with them scoring and that was difficult for us," Ferreira said. "Porto did not deserve the result...we didn't deserve to lose by so many goals.
