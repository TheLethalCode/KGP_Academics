 BEIJING, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China's Foreign Ministry condemned the Dalai Lama on Thursday for suggesting that his successor as Tibet's spiritual leader might be chosen by referendum, saying that would "violate religious rituals". The Dalai Lama has been considering options for choosing his successor, saying that senior lamas could follow Vatican practice and elect one of their number to succeed him, or that Tibetans might want to do away with the institution altogether.

Many Tibetans fear the death of the current Dalai Lama, now 72, would be a major setback in their fight for more autonomy within China or independence, creating a leadership vacuum that Beijing could be expected to exploit. In hopes of circumventing this, the Dalai Lama has long suggested that his reincarnation be sought outside China. More controversially, he also suggested in Japan this month that his successor could be chosen before his death. China has ruled remote, mountainous Tibet with an iron hand since Communist troops marched in there in 1950, and Tibetans have chafed under the yoke ever since. Tibetan monks rioted last week after an altercation between them and a Han Chinese shopkeeper. It was the most recent of a string of incidents in Tibet, where tensions between Chinese and Tibetans remain high. Liu said that while he had no more details on the incident, the general situation in Tibet was stable and its economy was developing well. "Anyone who tries to disrupt Tibet's stability and development will not have the support of the people and will not succeed," he add
