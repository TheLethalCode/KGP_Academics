<TITLE> Fire shuts key Canada-US pipeline, oil leaps $3 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 HOUSTON, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An explosion hit the main pipeline that supplies Canadian crude to US Midwest refineries on Wednesday, forcing operator Enbridge to halt nearly a fifth of US imports and sending crude prices $3 higher. One of the set of four pipelines will require repairs and regulator inspections, while the largest is "not likely" to start up any time soon, Larry Springer, a spokesman for Calgary, Alberta-based operator Enbridge Inc, said on Thursday. The smaller two lines were several hundred feet from the fire and appear to be undamaged, but will be inspected soon before they are restarted, Springer said by phone. Two employees were killed in the incident, which came after one pipeline was shut to inspect a small leak. The explosion about 3.0 miles (4.8 km) southeast of its Clearbrook, Minnisota, terminal, shut down a line that carries an estimated 1.9 million barrels per day (bpd) of Canadian crude, equivalent to about 9 percent of total U.S. oil demand. Oil prices roared more than 2 percent higher on the news, with traders fearing that the outage would leave mid-continent refiners short of crude. US futures stood $2.81 higher at $93.43 a barrel by 0803 GMT, rebounding from Wednesday's fall. "My initial impression is that (this) will put a halt to the slide in oil prices and put us back on the march towards $100 a barrel," ANZ senior commodities analyst Mark Pervan said. "The timing is pretty bad. We are coming to the strongest demand period for crude with the approach of the northern winter." Canada is the biggest supplier of foreign crude to the United States, accounting for almost one-fifth of its over 10 million bpd of imports, government data show. IMPORT] Nearly all of that is delivered via the Enbridge system. Springer declined to give a specific timeframe for restarting the lines, but a spokeswoman for the county said the fire could burn for another three days. "The area under fire now is 100 feet (30.5 metres) by 100 feet, it is anticipated to burn for up to three days," Jeanine Brand, County Attorney and Public Information Officer for Clearwater County, told Reuters by telephone. Enbridge was not able to say what caused the blast but said it was working with federal and state authorities to begin a thorough investigation. BIG OUTAGE A lasting disruption to Lines 3 and 4 -- which combined pump over 1.1 million bpd of mainly heavy and medium crude -- would put a strain on landlocked Midwest refiners such as Flint Hills Resources, Marathon Oil Corp and Koch Industries, which have few immediate alternatives to the Canadian supplies. That in turn could drain stocks in the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery point for New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) oil futures, although the Enbridge line does not flow directly there. Previous disruptions caused by leaks on the Enbridge system earlier this year have been patched up quickly enough to avoid any significant impact on customer deliveries, and the company was hopeful of restarting the smaller lines quickly. "There is nothing from any other sources that would make us think there is any damage (to Lines 1 and 2), but as prudent operators we have to inspect them before we start them back up," Enbridge's Springer said. The fire occurred at a main juncture in the line shortly before the US portion splits into a network of other lines. It supplies 62 percent of the crude refined in the Chicago area and 82 percent of Ontario's demand, according to the Web site of US arm Enbridge Energy Partners,
