<TITLE> Cuts will not hit quality, says BBC Trust chairman </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The chairman of the BBC Trust defended deep budget cuts to the corporation, insisting on Thursday that "genuine efficiency does not affect quality". Sir Michael Lyons said the controversial reforms, which will include thousands of job cuts, fewer programmes and better use of technology, will maintain or increase quality. Speaking at a London conference, Lyons said that in order to justify what he called the enormous privilege of the licence fee, the BBC must concentrate on the things that build its reputation as a public service broadcaster. He announced a greater public involvement in BBC decisions in a document entitled "Promise to Audiences". In it, he said the BBC would be more open and transparent in its decision-making, adding that it would be spin-free. Public trust in the corporation has been dented this year with the revelation of a series of rigged phone-ins and doctored documentary footage. The BBC's six-year cost-cutting drive, announced in October by Director-General Mark Thompson, will involve the loss of some 2,500 jobs, the sale of its West London headquarters and a 10 percent cut in programmes. Lyons said at the time he was satisfied the package would "safeguard the core values of the BBC at a time of radical change in technology, markets and audience expectations." But unions have threatened to take industrial action if the cuts go ahead. Strike ballot papers go out to members next week. If the vote is for action, it could take place from mid-January. "The Trust has set the BBC testing efficiency targets over the six-year period to ensure that management keep costs under tight control and release money for new investment that will benefit licence fee payers," Lyons said. "To describe this simply as about cuts misses the crucial point that money is being reinvested. "Genuine efficiency does not affect quality. It maintains or increases quality, while reducing costs through, for example, better use of technology, or new ways of working."
