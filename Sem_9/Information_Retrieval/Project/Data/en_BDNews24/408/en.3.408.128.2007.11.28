 Dhaka, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Wednesday acquitted all accused of charges of killing a student leader of Dhaka University. The verdict came after 17 years of the killing of Shahidul Islam Chunnu, who was a vice president of Sergeant Zohurul Haque Hall Chhatra Sangsad of the university and belonged to Bangladesh Chhatra League. Chunnu was shot dead in a firefight between Bangladesh Chhatra League and Bangladesh Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal near Haji Mohsin Hall on Feb 25, 1990. Chunnu's younger brother Mafizul Islam Munnu later filed a case with Ramna Police Station. The then inspector of Ramna Police Station Akhteruzaman Bhuiyan charged 11 Chhatra Dal leaders with the murder on March 19, 1991. Judge Md Abul Bashar of Dhaka Metropolitan Additional Sessions Judges Court-1 in his verdict said all 11 former Chhatra Dal leaders had been cleared of charges as the state side failed to prove the case. Only the investigating officer and the record officer of the case gave their deposition during trial. No other witnesses gave their depositions. The judge in his verdict said the plaintiff of the case did not come to the court for giving his statement despite repeated reminder by the court. Other witnesses also did not respond to the court call, he said, adding that the state failed to prove the case in the court. Assistant public prosecutor Ali Haider Kiran stood for the state while advocate Monjur Alam defended the accused. bdnews2
