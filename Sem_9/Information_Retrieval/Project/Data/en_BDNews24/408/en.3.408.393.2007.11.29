<TITLE> Venezuela's Chavez breaks Colombia diplomatic ties </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CARACAS, Nov 28 (bdnews24Reuters) - Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez broke off relations with Colombia on Wednesday, vowing not to restore ties while President Alvaro Uribe is in power, due to the collapse of mediation talks with leftist rebels. Uribe, Washington's top ally in South America, last week abruptly canceled Chavez's role as a mediator in negotiations with Colombia's Marxist rebels over freeing hostages, sparking a war of words between the two leaders. After recalling his ambassador in protest, Chavez went a step further on Wednesday, escalating a crisis that he has said could hurt the Andean neighbors' $6 billion bilateral trade. "I'm telling the world: As long as President Uribe is president of Colombia, I will not have any type of relations with him or with the government of Colombia. I cannot," the leader told a political rally in a state bordering Colombia. There was no immediate reaction from Colombia. Political analysts said the dispute would likely remain diplomatic without hurting economic ties. Chavez, one of the world's most vocal anti-US voices, burnished his nationalist credentials before he faces his toughest vote fight to date. Venezuelans cast ballots in a referendum on Sunday on a constitutional overhaul that could allow him to run for re-election indefinitely. "With Colombia, there is a lot of rhetoric on Chavez's part. It's good for him to keep this issue alive right now. But I doubt this will affect commercial relations, which are enormous," said Luis Vicente Leon of pollster Datanalisis. Chavez also froze relations with Spain this weekend in a spat that erupted when he called an ex-prime minister a fascist and Spain's King Juan Carlos told him to "shut up." Chavez has recalled ambassadors from Mexico and Peru in the past, although there was little impact on trade. The Cuba and Iran ally constantly rails at the United States, but has never stopped selling oil to Venezuela's top energy customer. Chavez branded the pro-U.S. Uribe on Tuesday as a "pawn of the empire." Conservative Uribe had refused to withdraw his ambassador in Caracas. He said on Wednesday that Chavez should stop acting emotionally. HEADSTRONG HEADS OF STATE "Heads of state should think not about their personal rage and their own vanity, but more about the need to respect the people they represent," Uribe said. The barbs contrasted with the presidents' apparent personal chemistry. The ideological opposites often engaged in light-hearted banter at their cross-border summits. The dispute is the worst between the neighbors since 2005, when Chavez withdrew his ambassador after bounty hunters snatched a Colombian rebel in Caracas and dumped him over the border to be arrested by Colombian police. "These are two headstrong, proud presidents that are going to find it difficult to repair their personal relationship," said Michael Shifter of the Inter-American Dialogue think tank in Washington. "(But) the governments will have to maintain a pragmatic relationship with one another." Uribe invited Chavez to help mediate a deal with leaders of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia to exchange jailed guerrillas for around 50 key hostages they are holding, including a French-Colombian woman and three U.S. men. But Uribe, who has received billions in aid from Washington to battle insurgents and drug traffickers, appeared to lose patience with Chavez's handling of the delicate talks. Uribe suspended Chavez's role as a mediator, saying he broke an accord by speaking directly to a general. Known for harsh insults, Chavez usually focuses his attacks against the United States during campaigns, but this year the Bush administration has avoiding being drawn into a spat. Wall Street economists say the fights could help distract voters from debating unpopular details in his reform package, such as wresting control over reserves from the central ba
