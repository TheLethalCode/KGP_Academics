<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com)  The National Board of Revenue would produce a Citizen's Charter within two weeks to reduce taxpayer's hassles, its chairman Wednesday said. At a meeting organised by the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industries, Mohammad Abdul Majid said the revenue authority wanted to create a tax-friendly atmosphere. Tax-related laws and a taxpayers' to-do list for paying taxes will be listed in the charter. Majid churned FBCCI president Mir Nasir Hossain's demand that the time to submit personal income tax returns be extended by 15 days. He said the time could not be extended. But taxpayers affected by the cyclone could submit their tax returns after the deadline in consultation with tax officials. Majid said the time had been extended twice before. Income tax returns will be received until 8pm Sunday as November 30 is a government holiday, the NBR chief added. Mir Nasir said domestic products could not compete with imported products as the government in the budget for fiscal year 2007-08 raised the duty on raw materials to 10 percent from earlier rates between 0 and 5 percent. He demanded that the duty on raw materials be cut in the interest of local industry. He sought the help of the NBR chairman to reduce the government weekend at land ports to one day a week. The NBR chairman said: "A Better Business Forum has been formed. The Regulatory Reforms Commission has started work. Both the FBCCI chairman and I are members of both committees." bdnews24
