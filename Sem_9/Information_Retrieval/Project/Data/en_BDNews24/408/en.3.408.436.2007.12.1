 Dhaka, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com)  Runaway leaders Rajshahi made it six wins on the trot Saturday while Dhaka and Barisal fetched their third and second win in the National Cricket League. A superb all-round display from Farhad Hossain kept Rajshahi at the top of the point table, handing a five-wicket defeat to Sylhet in the sixth round one-dayer at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. Dhaka avenged their 39-run loss in the first leg to Khulnawho slipped to a third straight defeatdefeating them by eight wickets at Bir Shrestha Shaheed Motiur Rahman Stadium. At Bir Shrestha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium, four fifties from Kamrul Islam, Arafat Salahuddin, Rakibul Hasan and Imran Ahmed powered Barisal to an exciting 15-run win over hosts Chittagong, who had beat Barisal by eight wickets in first leg. After the sixth round, Rajshahi topped the six-team point table with a maximum 12, six clear of joint second-paced Dhaka and Khulna. With their second straight win, Barisal joined third-placed Sylhet and Chittagong with four points. Rajshahi vs Sylhet Pacer Shafaq Al Zabir and Delwar Hossain justified Rajshahi captain Khaled Mashud's decision to bowl first by removing opener Imtiaz Hosssain (1) and Mushfiqur Rahim (8) for 24 for two. Two-down Alok Kapali repaired the damage with a strokeful 69 off 64 balls, including six fours and two sixes, while makeshift opener Rajin Saleh and Golam Mabud chipped in with 31 and 26. Kapali left the side at 134 for four, but the middle order failed to keep the momentum as spinner Farhad Hossain wiped the tails to restrict Sylhet to 206 all out with three balls to spare. Farhad clamed five wickets in a row for just 16 runs. In reply, Rajshahi lost opener Jahurul Islam (9) in the third over, but Rabiul Karim (54) and Farhad Hossain (41) put on 90 runs for the second wicket before the league leaders faced a little hiccup, skidding to 126 for four. However, Nayeem Islam (52 not out) and national discard Mushfiqur Rahman (40 not out) steered Rajshahi to 209 for four in 46.5 overs. Dhaka vs Khulna Pacer Mahbubul Alam Robin proved Khulna skipper Mashrafee Bin Mortaza's decision to bat first wrong by running through the top order with four for 34. Khulna struggled eventually plunged to 51 for six and never recovered. Abdur Razzak topscored with 39 off 56 balls to help Khulna finish on 125 all out in 37.2 overs. Dhaka easily reached home making 126 for two in 33.2 overs after Shamsur Rahman and Mehrab Hossain Opee (22) laid 60 runs for the opening stand. Abdur Razzak finished with two for 24. Shamsur (53) and Al Shahriar Rokon (35) remained unbeaten to propel Dhaka to their third win in six matches. Chittagong vs Barisal Despite the early losses of openers Hannan Sarkar (15) and Shahriar Nafees (2), Barisal posted a challenging 289 for five in 50 overs after being asked to bat first. Imran and Rakibul made sure there were no further damage by adding 95 runs for the third wicket before Chittagong captain Ehsanul Haq broke the stand. He had Imran (50) caught behind and then bowled Rakibul for 56. Kamrul and Salahuddin blunted the opponent bowlers to add 143 runs for the fifth wicket. Kamrul played an unbeaten run-a-ball 78 with the help of six fours and one six and Salahuddin blasted a 46-ball 68, smashing five sixes and two fours. Chittagong appeared on course to overhaul the target despite being reduced to 50 for four, but finally 274 all out in 47.5 overs. Barisal pacers Talha Jubair and Sajedul Islam tore through the top order. Middle orders Nazimuddin (84), Ehsanul (57) and Faisal Hossain (45) raised hopes, but the run outs of Ehsanul and Faisal threw Chittagong out of the game. bd
