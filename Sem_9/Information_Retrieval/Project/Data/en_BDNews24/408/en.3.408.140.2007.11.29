 Dhaka, Nov 29 (bdnews.com)  Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Thursday said only 11 percent of Annual Development Programme (ADP) for 2007-08 was implemented and called it a 'disappointment'. "Government officials, involved in other jobs due to natural calamities, could not give proper attention to ADP implementation. As a result, in the first four months (July to October) of the current financial year, ADP implementation did not take place as expected," he said at a news briefing. "Only eleven percent of the ADP has been implemented and this is not at all satisfactory," he said. Mirza Azizul was speaking to the media after an Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC) meeting presided over by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed at the NEC conference room at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar. The chief adviser asked officials at the ECNEC meeting to prioritise projects that contributed to cutting down on poverty, the finance adviser said. "The ECNEC meeting approved the Tk 1,214 crore Second Emergency Flood-Loss Rehabilitation Project that the Asian Development Bank will finance. "The foreign aid component of the project is Tk 860 crore. The remaining amount will be locally arranged." The adviser said ECNEC approved a Tk 85 crore project for improved rice, wheat and jute seed production preservation and distribution. It also approved a similar project involving Tk 28 crore, he added. Replying to a question on whether the ADP will be cut down in size, the adviser said, "No ADP has so far been implemented a hundred percent. Nothing can be said about slashing the ADP during the initial period of the financial year." The government will review the issue in detail in December, after which a decision on the issue will be taken, he said. bdnews24.co
