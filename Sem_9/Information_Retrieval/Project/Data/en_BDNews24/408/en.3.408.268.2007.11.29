<TITLE> Totti ready to give Italy emergency cover for Euro 2008 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ROME, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - AS Roma striker Francesco Totti has said he would come out of international retirement for Euro 2008 if Italy coach Roberto Donadoni needed him. "If I was needed because of some injuries or an emergency (I would be willing)," the Roma captain told GQ magazine. Totti took a break from international duty after picking up a 2006 World Cup winners' medal, but then announced he was quitting the national team completely in July this year. He added in the GQ interview that he did not want to steal the place of any of the existing members of the squad and said he only wanted to be considered as an emergency option. "It's right that the 22-24 players who have won qualification (to Euro 2008) go. If I took someone's place, it wouldn't be right." He cited the example of Zinedine Zidane, who came out of international retirement to help France qualify for, and reach the final of, last year's World Cup. The 31-year-old Totti, who made 58 appearances for Italy scoring nine goals, had ruled out making an Azzurri return just last week. Totti's offer is unlikely to tempt Donadoni, who has frequently expressed irritation at having to answer questions about a player who has ruled himself out of his plans. Meanwhile, Rolando Bianchi has said he aims to win a regular place in the Manchester City starting lineup to earn a crack at an Italy call-up. "My dream is to play for Italy and I want to realise it as soon as possible," the striker told Mediaset television. "I'm working hard to win my place here and to have a chance to play for the national team. I must keep working as I have been and give 200 percent.
