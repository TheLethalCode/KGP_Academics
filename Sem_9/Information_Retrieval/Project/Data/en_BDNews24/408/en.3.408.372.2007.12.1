 BUDAPEST, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hungary's trade unions plan to lobby deputies of the ruling Socialist party who they think may be susceptible to vote against a key health reform bill this month, a top union official said on Saturday. The bill will allow the government to replace the state-owned health insurance fund with 22 regional funds in which 49 percent stakes would be sold to private companies. Liga union group and the VDSZSZ, the main railway union, have called a general strike from Dec. 17 -- the day parliament votes on the bill -- and said trains will not run until the government gives up its health reform plans. Liga President Istvan Gasko said the union had a list of about 40 Socialist deputies who it thinks can be persuaded to vote against the bill on Dec. 17. "We know the Socialist MPs by name who we can hope that after brief 'conscience training' will represent the interests of (health care) contribution payers," he told the daily Nepszabadsag in an interview. The Socialists hold 190 seats in the 386-member parliament and their liberal coalition partner, SZDSZ has 20. Liga is one of Hungary's six main trade union groups. The other groups also oppose the planned health reform which they say will hit the poor, but they have not joined Liga's strike call. The bill has also created tension in the coalition as the Socialists wanted weaker management rights for the private investors than SZDSZ, less guaranteed profits to the funds and more state revenue from the sale of the stakes. The bill is a key part of the government's efforts to cut the bloated budget deficit in a sustainable way. Its tax hikes and spending cuts have caused sharp falls in the ruling parties' popularity, triggering concern among their MPs.
