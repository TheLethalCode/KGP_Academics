<TITLE> Show seeks to love match migrants and US citizens </TITLE>

 PHOENIX, Dec 02 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Los Angeles company is touting a new reality game show called "Who Wants to Marry a US Citizen" that aims to create televised matrimony between legal citizens and immigrants who have temporary visas. The show's backers at Morusa Media hope to make a sort of love match between reality TV and a national obsession with immigration. But the producers make no promise that a marriage will occur or lead to US citizenship. Show creator Adrian Martinez said that Morusa Media has not yet found a network to produce or air the show, but he is currently in talks with one cable TV network and already has signed up contestants for six episodes. "It's this generation's 'Dating Game,' but with a twist -- it aims to show love knows no borders," Martinez told Reuters. As in the "Dating Game," which ran on network TV for more than two decades starting in the 1960s, a single US citizen gets to ask contestants various questions. Toward the end of the show, he or she decides which one to select as a potential mate. So far, most of the contestants are Hispanic immigrants, although at least one is from the Philippines, Martinez said. In a statement, Morusa said that while it does not guarantee marriage or legal status, it will pay for a wedding party and honeymoon should a marriage result. "We're just out to play matchmaker," said the show's host, Angelo Gonzales. "There are thousands of US citizens seeking a spouse, and just as many immigrants seeking the same. So we want to make it a win-win situation for all involved."
