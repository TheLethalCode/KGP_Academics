 Sylhet, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka's Mohammedan Sporting Club played a goalless draw against Sylhet DSA in a fundraising match for Sidr victims at Sylhet Stadium Friday. The game was enjoyed by a 5,000-strong crowd. The 90-minute match was reduced to 60 minutes because Mohammedan arrived late. B League runners-up Mohammedan pumped up their side with Muktijoddha Sangsad loan defender Hasan Al Mamun, medio Arman Aziz and goalie Aminul Islam. But they still failed to find the back of the net. The local side, Sylhet, hired former national striker Alfaz Ahmed and former national defender Jewel Rana to hold Mohammedan. "Both sides played well but missed a few opportunities," said Mohammedan coach Shafiqul Islam Manik, whose side will play the second fundraiser against Tangail on Saturday. Sylhet DSA general secretary Fazlur Rahman Babul told bdnews24.com that funds raised from the match would be provided to Sidr victims along with another Tk 2 lakh earned from ticket sales to different clubs and banks. bdnew
