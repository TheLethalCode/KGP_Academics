 ISPARTA, Turkey, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Turkish budget airliner crashed in the mountains in south-west Turkey on Friday, killing all 56 people on board, officials said. Private AtlasJet Airlines Chief Executive Tuncay Doganer said the cause of the crash was not clear as weather conditions were normal and the aircraft had no known technical problems. Officials said all on board appeared to have been Turkish. The 165-seat MD 83 plane, manufactured by McDonnell Douglas, crashed in the early hours of Friday near the town of Isparta. It had been flying from Istanbul with 49 passengers and seven crew. The crash occurred 12 km (7.5 miles) from Isparta's Suleyman Demirel airport. The aircraft's black box should explain what happened, Doganer told reporters. Turkey is in the grip of winter with snow and fog common on higher ground across much of the country. "No matter what measures you take, plane accidents happen and we see that 80 to 85 percent are due to human error," said Transport Minister Binali Yildirim, adding regular inspections had been carried out on the leased plane. Rescue workers reached the mountainous crash site after military helicopters spotted the wreckage of the airliner. A reporter from state-run Anatolian news agency who arrived with a military helicopter said she saw bodies strewn around the area of the crash, with personal belongings and luggage scattered on the hillside along with aircraft debris. Some dead passengers were still strapped to their seats. The area was later sealed off as rescue workers removed the bodies to take them to local hospitals. Turkish television showed a large section of the plane, with emergency exits open, intact on the side of a forested hill. It appeared the front and back of the aircraft were smashed. Anxious relatives arrived at Istanbul's Ataturk airport seeking news of the passengers. "They have great pain. This is a terrible thing, we should all support them," Istanbul deputy governor Cafer Yildiz told reporters. He said a plane carrying the relatives would fly soon to Isparta. The aircraft disappeared from radar screens shortly before it was due to land at Isparta, about 150 km (90 miles) north of the Mediterranean resort of Antalya. Aviation authorities lost contact with the plane just after the pilot said he was preparing to land at Isparta. "As the plane was approaching its descent, it sought permission to land and after receiving a positive reply from the tower, contact was lost," the agency quoted local deputy governor Tayyar Sasmaz as saying. The aircraft was leased by Turkish-based World Focus Airlines to AtlasJet, which operates 15 plan
