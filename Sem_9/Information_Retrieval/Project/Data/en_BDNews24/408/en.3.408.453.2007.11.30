 LONDON, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran's main nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili said on Friday it would pursue its atomic programme even if the United Nations Security Council were to impose new sanctions on the Islamic Republic. "Iran has removed concerns and cooperated with the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency). But if some countries want to use the UN Security Council and its resolutions to stop Iran's atomic work, surely they will not be successful," Jalili told reporters in London.
