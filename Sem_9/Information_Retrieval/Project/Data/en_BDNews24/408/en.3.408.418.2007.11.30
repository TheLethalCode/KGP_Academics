 Bogota, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Colombian government broadcast videos on Friday of kidnapped politician Ingrid Betancourt and three Americans in the first proof since 2003 that the high-profile rebel hostages were still alive. The videos, which also showed Colombian military officers kidnapped by guerrillas, were confiscated from three suspected rebels captured in Bogota and included images from October, Peace Commissioner Luis Carlos Restrepo said. Betancourt, a dual French-Colombian citizen and former presidential candidate captured in 2002, and the Americans are among the most well-known captives held by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia or FARC rebels waging Latin America's oldest insurgency. "In a Colombian army operation against the FARC's urban networks, three people were captured and in their possession was found proof of life of a group of kidnap victims," Restrepo told reporters. Brief clips of the videos broadcast by local television showed images of Betancourt sitting in jungle surroundings and the Americans. U.S. contractors, Thomas Howes, Marc Gonsalves and Keith Stansell, were snatched by the FARC when their aircraft crashed on a counter-narcotics mission. Restrepo said letters and photographs from hostages were also found. Started in the 1960s as a leftist insurgency, the FARC is now deeply engaged in Colombia's cocaine trade and has kidnapped scores of police, soldiers, business owners and lawmakers for ransom and political leverage. While violence from Colombia's 4-decade-old conflict has ebbed under President Alvaro Uribe, the conservative leader is under pressure to resolve the plight of hostages still held in secret jungle camps, some for as long as nearly a decade. The FARC wants to exchange around 50 hostages for jailed rebel fighters, but recent efforts by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to broker a hostage deal fell apart after Colombia suspended his role as mediator in any talks to free rebel kidnap victims. The failed hostage release efforts triggered a diplomatic spat between Uribe and Chavez, who has said he will have no relations with Colombia while Uribe is in office. Negotiations over the FARC hostages have been stalled over rebel demands Uribe demilitarize an area the size of New York City in southern Colombia as a condition for talks. The US ally has refused such a safe haven under rebel terms saying it would allow the FARC to regroup.
