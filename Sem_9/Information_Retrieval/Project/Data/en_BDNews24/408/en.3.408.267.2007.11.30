<TEXT>
 HARARE, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Shivnarine Chanderpaul scored an unbeaten century in vain as West Indies lurched to a shock defeat to Zimbabwe in the first one-day international on Friday. The hosts posted a total of 274 for eight from their 50 overs with half centuries for Chamu Chibhabha and Stuart Matsikenyeri before Chanderpaul's defiant 127 helped the tourists fall 30 runs short at 244 for eight in reply. Zimbabwe, who were put in to bat, slumped to 78-3 in the 18th over before Chibhabha and Hamilton Masakadza righted the innings with a fourth-wicket stand of 90. They were parted in the 36th over when off-spinner and captain Chris Gayle trapped Chibhabha in front for 73. Gayle dismissed Masakadza for 36 in identical fashion in his next over, but Zimbabwe were kept on course for their challenging total by a partnership of 89 between Elton Chigumbura and Matsikenyeri. Matsikenyeri kept a firm hand on the latter overs of the innings before being bowled for 55 by fast bowler Jerome Taylor in the 49th over. Medium pacer Chigumbura quickly removed Gayle (2) and Devon Smith (5) to reduce West Indies to 22-2 in the seventh over. Chanderpaul and Marlon Samuels (25) fought back with a stand of 55, and Runako Morton scored 54 to help Chanderpaul add another 118 runs for the fourth wicket. But while Chanderpaul scored briskly, overall the runs came at too slow a pace to keep the West Indians in the hunt and their required run-rate rocketed to double figures in the second half of the innings. Chigumbura took 3-25. The second game in the five-match series is in Harare on Sunday
