 KANDY, Sri Lanka, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England fast bowler Matthew Hoggard was delighted after he played an instrumental part in bowling out Sri Lanka for 188 in the first test on Saturday. Hoggard claimed four for 29 as England, who finished the day on 49 for one, took control of the match. "After losing the toss this is a great position to be in," Hoggard told reporters. "If you'd said at the beginning that we would lose the toss and be 150 behind with one wicket down we would have taken it," he added. "We said the night before that it was a good toss to lose as history shows the first innings here is the lower-scoring of the two," he said. "We knew it was going to swing and we kept the balls in the right areas. "The bowlers did really well and that created the pressure for us. "We've got a good start and it's now up to us to make sure we follow it through and get a big first-innings total." Kumar Sangakkara, who top scored for Sri Lanka with 92, paid tribute to Hoggard. "It was a pretty tough day out there for the batters although there were no demons in the track," Sangakkara said. "Hoggy bowled well at the start, putting the ball in the right areas and getting the ball moving just enough to take the edges. "We've now just got to learn from this and move on quickly. We have to show some character and drag the match back," he added. "The pitch is still very good but there were some balls that kept low at the end of the day and that is a good sign if we can exploit it.
