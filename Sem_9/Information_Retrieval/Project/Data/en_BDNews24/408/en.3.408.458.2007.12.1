 Dhaka, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com)  The Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry are divided over their organisation's fate as the extended tenure of the executive committee ends Dec 6. Some members want the incumbent committee to continue while others want an administrator, according to the members present at the annual general meeting Saturday. "That's right. These were the two positions at the AGM," FBCCI president Mir Nasir Hossain told bdnews24.com. Hossain said he did not want to say more on the subject. "I'm ready to quit the committee on Dec 6." Elections to the FBCCI's executive body were scheduled for Nov 22, but a legal tangle over the voter roll has stayed the election process. The ministry of commerce extended the tenure of the current executive committee until Dec 6. But the court case is still pending, throwing the elections into uncertainty. The government may appoint an administrator to run the FBCCI until a new elected leadership takes over. "We don't want an administrator at the FBCCI," said Helal Uddin, an FBCCI director. "An administrator can't safeguard the interests of businessmen." "We want the disputes to be resolved as early as possible," he added. He said a board meeting had been called for Dec 6 to decide the issue. Earlier, BGMEA leaders Annisul Huq, Mohammad A Salam, Faisal Samad, ABM Shamsuddin, and Ferdous Parvez Bivon were dropped from the FBCCI voter list. FBCCI dropped the five names from the voters' roll following a petition filed by businessman Mahbub Minhaz claiming that the BMGEA members had been elected to the executive committee through a flawed poll. The arbitration council of FBCCI in its verdict said the BGMEA election was held in violation of court orders and the results were illegal and void. bdne
