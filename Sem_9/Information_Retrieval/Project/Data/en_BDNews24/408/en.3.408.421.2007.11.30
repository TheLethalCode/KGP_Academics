 Abu Noman Sajib bdnews24.com Correspondent Barguna, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com)  Dozens of cyclone-hit microfinance debtors and their families in Barguna fled their homes in fear of angry loan collectors. Many villagers alleged that NGO workers threatened to remove the tin-sheet roofs off their houses. Some were allegedly threatened with arrest. "No NGO worker came to the village in the first week after the storm. They started coming in the second week for to collect loan repayments," Rina Begum of Nimtalir Char under Barguna Sadar Upazila told bdnews24.com Thursday. bdnews24.com correspondent Abu Noman Sajib travelled around Barguna and Patuakhali districts and spoke to over 100 people who were in debt to NGOs. The villagers alleged ASA, a microcredit organisation, had launched a loan programme in the cyclone-hit areas to collect repayments. Some NGOs earlier said they had suspended loan repayment collections. ASA president Shafiqul Haque Choudhury, a former adviser to the caretaker government, told bdnews24.com on Nov 24 that his organisation had postponed repayments. Rina said she took Tk 8,000 in loans from Grameen Bank three months ago and bought her husband a rickshaw. She also bought a cow for Tk 8,000 with money from an ASA loan with a weekly repayment instalment of Tk 200. The cow did not survive the storm. They rickshaw was sold for money for food. Rina fled home fearing the NGOs' wrath saying an NGO worker asked her to take fresh loans to repay the previous loan. She alleged that NGO workers threatened to take the tin sheets off her house in the event that she failed to repay the money. Rina now lives in a roadside thatched shanty. "The cow used to give us 2.5kg of milk a day. I used to repay the loan with money we got from selling milk. The storm took away my cow and rickshaw. How shall I feed my children?" Rina said. Grameen Bank workers asked her to attend a meeting Monday where the date to start loan repayments would be fixed through discussion. ASA workers said they would come Saturday. Shahinur Begum of the same village told bdnews24.com a similar tale. She took a Tk 8,000 loan from Grameen Bank to build a house and a Tk 8,000 from ASA to buy her husband a rice thresher. The cyclone destroyed her home. The thresher was broken. ASA manager for Barguna Sadar upazila region-1 Md Nasiruddin told bdnews24.com that the NGO was giving interest-free loans to help cyclone-distressed people. He denied allegations that the NGO was disbursing loans in order to secure previous repayments and interest. "This money is being given to people to buy rickshaws or build houses. Repayments on this loan will start three months later," he said. Riazuddin, ASA branch manageralso in Barguna districtsaid collections on previous loan repayments had been suspended indefinitely. The ASA official said that 50,808 people received microcredit in the district. bdnews24.
