 Dhaka, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com)  The probe committee on the Bangabandhu National Stadium press box roof collapse submits its final report Thursday, 50 days after the 150-capacity suspension box fell sometime after the World Cup pre-qualifying tie between Bangladesh and Tajikistan October 8. "We are going to submit the final report on Thursday morning as all members of the committee finalised the report Monday in light of two laboratory test reports," probe committee chief Abdur Rahman told bdnews24.com Wednesday. "We have not considered who was contractor, designer or consultant for that job as all five members of the committee have reached a consensus on the final report," said Rahman. After the press box mishap, the National Sports Council (NSC) formed a five-member probe committee, head by NSC director (planning and development) and asked it to submit a preliminary report in one working day. The committee did accordingly. The committee, however, recommended that the debris be tested at a lab for more information and samples were sent to the Bangladesh University of Engineering Technology (BUET) and the Military Institute of Science and Technology (MIST) before the Eid-ul-fitr in October. The NSC got the MIST lab report on October 31 and the BUET lab repot on November 10, but the committee took a bit more time to finalise the report citing unavailability of its members. "I will send the report to the NSC chairman and Bangladesh Army chief General Moeen U Ahmed as soon as I get it," said NSC secretary Aminul Islam.
