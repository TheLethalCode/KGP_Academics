 BELGRADE, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The family of Bosnian Serb war crimes fugitive Stojan Zupljanin urged the former police commander on Saturday to "sacrifice" himself for the nation and turn himself in. Serbia's path to European Union membership has been blocked by a failure to arrest war crimes fugitives, who are regarded as heroes by some 30 percent of the Serb population. "The Serb people and the two states where they live are exposed to big pressure," said a letter addressed to Zupljanin and published in Serbia's top-selling Blic daily. "These states have to survive and there is a need for a sacrifice to be made," the family wrote. "The decision is yours." Zupljanin is one of four war crimes suspects from the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s still on the run. Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic, his army commander Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic, a Croatian Serb leader, are also wanted under indictments by the United Nations tribunal in the Hague. They are all believed to be hiding either in Serbia or in the Serb-run half of Bosnia. Carla del Ponte, the chief prosecutor of the Hague court, arrives in Belgrade on Monday to determine if Serbia is making any headway and deserves to sign the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, the first step to membership. MAKING HEADWAY Del Ponte was quoted on Saturday as telling the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant she expects Mladic to be arrested in December or January. "I am 80 percent certain that Mladic will be arrested before year-end. "This is a crucial moment. Serbia is at the end of negotiations to become a candidate for European Union membership. The political pressure to extradite Mladic is very big," she said. Del Ponte said she also expected Serbia to deliver Karadzic but did not say when this could happen. The EU has so far only initialled the accord with Serbia, pending del Ponte's recommendation or the delivery of more suspects. Zupljanin's son Mladen told Blic that the family, who live in a small Bosnian Serb town, has had their house raided several times by police in search of the fugitive. "We cannot have normal lives, we cannot get jobs," he told the newspaper. "I wanted to put out a public appeal to my father to surrender." Zupljanin, charged for crimes against Muslims and Croats during the 1992-95 Bosnia war, is regarded by Serb media as the most accessible of the four fugitives. They have reported several times that he was in custody, with authorities waiting for the right time to give him up. Both Serbia and Bosnia say they have no information on the whereabouts of Mladic and Karadzic, the top suspects wanted on two counts of genocide.
