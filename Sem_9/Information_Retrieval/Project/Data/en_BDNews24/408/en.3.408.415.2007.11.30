 HARARE, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thousands of Zimbabwean war veterans gathered in Harare on Friday to lead a `million-man march' in support of President Robert Mugabe's bid to extend his rule despite a severe economic crisis blamed on his government. Mugabe, 83 and in power since Zimbabwe's independence from Britain in 1980, is seeking re-election in presidential and parliamentary elections set for March 2008 after some senior officials in his ZANU-PF party failed to stop him from running. Mugabe, who looks fit for his age and remains combative in the face of a crumbling economy and growing discontent -- has mobilised his independence war veterans, his shock political troops, to assert his authority. Thousands of ZANU-PF supporters -- ferried into the capital Harare by bus and train -- converged at various points in the city on Friday, singing revolutionary songs and pledging support for one of the world's most controversial leaders. Men and women, both young and old, jogged around as they prepared to march for miles to Zimbabwe Grounds -- a sprawling sports arena in Harare's Highfield township -- where Mugabe was due to address them later in the day.

But some ZANU-PF officials quietly say the economy and their business interests suffered under Mugabe's leadership and want him to step aside and appoint a successor capable of reviving the economy and improving strained ties with key Western donors. War veterans leader Jabulani Sibanda told state media that the "one million men and women march" was meant to demonstrate that Mugabe, who co-led Zimbabwe's independence war in the 1970s, enjoyed solid support despite Western powers' opposition to his rule. "Comrade Mugabe is our leader, and we are prepared to wage another war to defend his leadership and our sovereign right to choose our own revolutionary leader," he said. The economy has all but collapsed since Mugabe ordered the seizure of white-owned farms to give to landless blacks in 2000, gutting the key commercial agriculture sector. Zimbabwe has suffered a wave of sporadic labour strikes over pay, forcing Mugabe to print money to keep his grip on the economy, analysts s
