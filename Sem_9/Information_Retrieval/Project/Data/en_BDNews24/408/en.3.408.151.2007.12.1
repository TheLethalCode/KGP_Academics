 Dhaka, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com)  Indian external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee said Saturday goods of the least developed nations including Bangladesh under Saarc would get duty-free access to Indian market. Pranab, who is in Dhaka on a single-day visit, said that an official notification by India was expected to settle the long-drawn issue by Dec 31. He made the comment after meeting foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury at state guesthouse Padma. Earlier in the day, he arrived in the capital to see firsthand the devastation of tropical Cyclone Sidr in southern coastal region amid pledges that India would do everything needed for the cyclone victims. Pranab said India was willing to allow sale of about 500,000 tonnes of rice to Bangladesh since it was desperately looking for food aid from donors to tackle the post-cyclone demand. The announcement came amid the government's statement that the country would need import of about 1.9 million tonnes of rice, according to CS Karim who heads the agriculture ministry. Karim at a news briefing in Bangladesh Secretariat made the statement, saying the cyclone damaged crops worth about Tk2,000 crore in 30 districts. Pranab Saturday acknowledged that India was exporting more to Bangladesh but importing less from its Muslim-majority neighbour, which currently chairs the least developed countries (LDCs). Bangladesh suffers from a huge trade imbalance with India, and the government has long been demanding India takes measures to curb the imbalance. The annual volume of trade between Bangladesh and India is about $ 2 billion. "India is thinking of narrowing the imbalance," Pranab said, adding that a commerce-secretary level committee of two countries was working out a plan on that. India expressed shock at the loss of lives and property to the cyclone that battered a vast swathe of the southern Bangladesh on Nov 15. The official death toll has crossed 3,200 while the millions of survivors left hungry and homeless are struggling to restart their life. Earlier in the morning at Zia International Airport, Pranab said his government would continue to support Bangladesh in the struggle of rebuilding the battered region. At the tarmac, he handed over 36.4 tons of relief goods to the foreign adviser, which included 10 tons of milk powder, water filter, 6,000 blankets, ready-to-eat food stuffs and medicines. "I would like to make more announcements today. Given the magnitude of the natural calamity, India has decided to waive the ban on the exports of rice to Bangladesh for an additional five lakh tonnes of rice," he told reporters after he arrived at ZIA at 9:15am. India had earlier announced to waive ban on 50,000 tonnes of rice. Pranab called on chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed and told him that the Indian government decided to waive the ban on export of rice. He added that India would express to Bangladesh its willingness to adopt 10 severely-affected coastal villages for rehabilitation. India had earlier imposed a ban on all rice exports to meet its domestic demand after summer floods damaged crops. New Delhi had earlier eased that ban and agreed to sell 50,000 tons of rice to Bangladesh in the wake of heavy crop losses in monsoon floods in Bangladesh. On the train services between Dhaka and Kolkata, the Indian minister said the services could not be opened yet because of 'some technical reasons'. bdnews24.co
