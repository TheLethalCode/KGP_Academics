<TITLE> US unsure over Iran's weaker role in Iraq: general </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 HELSINKI, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran's activities in Baghdad have drastically declined but the United States is not sure how to interpret Tehran's weakening role inside Iraq, a retired US general and White House military advisor said on Thursday. General Jack Keane, a former Army vice chief of staff, said the training of Shi'ite militia and the use of rockets, mortars and enhanced IEDs -- or advanced remote-controlled bombs -- had fallen in the last six weeks. "We don't know yet whether that's a reflection of an Iranian policy decision which would mean that it appears that the US has swung this war in its favour ... or whether they are just having a strategic pause ... and then it will escalate even further," Keane told Reuters at an event in Helsinki. Washington accuses Tehran of funding, training and arming Shi'ite militias in Iraq. The military often displays weapons, including rockets and roadside bombs, it says have been supplied by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' elite Qods Force. Tehran denies the charge and blames the violence in Iraq on the U.S.-led invasion in 2003. In recent weeks, US officials in Iraq appeared to have softened their tone towards Tehran, although US commander Don Farris said earlier this week that Shi'ite militias in Baghdad continued to receive support from Iran. Keane said the United States was very "concerned" about Iran's move and he expected the next two to three months to show what was behind recent developments. "We've defeated the Al Qaeda operationally. There remains a risk with the Iranians and we are not sure what they are up to, to be frank about it," he said. "The Iranians have told us that whatever perception we have of their involvement is wrong ... Fundamentally, we don't trust them. They look into your face and lie to you."
