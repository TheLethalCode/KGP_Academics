 Dhaka, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com) - With the slogan, "man stands for man", the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) has stood by Sidr-affected people by organising a best-of-three football match series to raise funds. The country's two popular outfits--Abahani and Mohammedan--will play the series at Bangabandhu National Stadium on Dec 3, 5 and 7. "We will be happy if our little effort helps the Sidr survivors," BFF acting general secretary Manzoor Hossain Malu said at a news conference at the BFF House Thursday. Malu urged the general people to come forward to extend their helping hands through watching the matches at the big bowl. Mohammedan SC general secretary Lokman Hossain Bhuiyan and Abahani director Kazi Nabil Ahmed, also co-chairmen of the series, and Bangladesh Olympic Association chief operating officer Col (retd) Waliullah were present at the briefing. "Though it is a noble service for the affected people, the series will be competitive and the fans will enjoy each of the three matches," said Nabil, urging the Abahani supporters to turn up at the stadium to watch the matches. "It is a humanitarian service rather than a series between two arch-rivals who I believe will play well as in the past," said Lokman. He urged Mohammedan supporters to extend their assistance to the Sidr victims through watching the matches. The BFF has already taken a massive initiative to attract the people and are publicising their ideas through all Dhaka clubs, referees, coaches, footballers and organisers. "We have opened 21 booths in the city from where the tickets will be sold," Malu said. "Many former booters and organisers have been pushing the ticket sale and we are hopeful that the matches will be held in a 35,000-capacity stadium." The gallery ticket has been fixed at Tk 30 and the VIP gallery at Tk 100. A three-match gallery ticket has been fixed at Tk 75. Journalists and organisers who will watch the matches will also have to pay. The match starts at 4:30pm each day. bdne
