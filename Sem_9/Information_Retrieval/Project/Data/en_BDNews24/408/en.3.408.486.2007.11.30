<TITLE> New Papal encylical blasts atheism, promises hope </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 VATICAN CITY, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pope Benedict, in a new encyclical released on Friday, launched an attack on atheism, saying it was responsible for some of the "greatest forms of cruelty and violations of justice" in history. In the second encyclical of his papacy, Benedict urged Christians to put their hope for the future in God and not in technology, wealth or political ideologies which can often be deluding. The 75-page "Spe Salvi," which takes its Latin title from a quote by St Paul (in hope we were saved), is an appeal to a pessimistic world to find strength in Christian hope. The document is a theological and sociological tour de force written in a highly academic, professorial style in which the Pope quotes saints, philosophers and writers to make his point. He said that atheism could be seen by some as a "type of moralism", particularly in the 19th and 20th centuries, to protest against the injustices of the world and world history. "A world marked by so much injustice, innocent suffering, and cynicism of power cannot be the work of a good God. A God with responsibility for such a world would not be a just God, much less a good God," he wrote, reciting arguments made by atheists. History has proven wrong ideologies such as Marxism which say humans had to establish social justice because God did not exist, the Pope wrote. "It is no accident that this idea has led to the greatest forms of cruelty and violations of justice," the Pope said, adding that such a concept was grounded in "intrinsic falsity". Marxism, the Pope wrote, had left behind "a trail of appalling destruction" because it failed to realise that man could not be "merely the product of economic conditions". HOPE IN GOD, NOT MAN In the encyclical, which is the highest form of papal writing and addresses all members of the Church, the Pope urged Christians to put their hope for a better future in God. "We have all witnessed the way in which progress, in the wrong hands, can become and has indeed become a terrifying progress in evil. If technical progress is not matched by corresponding progress in man's ethical formation, in man's inner growth, then it is not progress at all, but a threat for man and for the world," he said. "Let us put it very simply: man needs God, otherwise he remains without hope." Christian hope also meant protecting the planet, even if people feel powerless to make any changes in their lifetimes. "We can free our life and the world from the poisons and contaminations that could destroy the present and the future. We can uncover the sources of creation and keep them unsullied, and in this way we can make a right use of creation, which comes to us as a gift..." he said. Benedict's first encyclical, "Deus Caritas Est" (God is Love) was about erotic and spiritual love in a personal relationship. The Pope, who was elected in 2005, is believed to be working on a third encyclical on the theme of social justice. It is due to be released next ye
