<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com)  Visiting Indian external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee Saturday appealed to developed countries to put commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions into effect. He said natural disasters would be repeated if climate change was not tackled. "This (climate change) is an issue that the international community will have to address... and this type of incident (cyclones) is likely to happen in future. "Please undertake the responsibilities and commitment which have been made at the Kyoto conference," Pranab said at a press conference at the Radisson Water Gardens Hotel. "I am surely quite convinced that this is an area where we have to work together. I do hope that at the Bali conference which is taking place next week, the international community will be able to find some solution to this problem." bdnew
