 Dhaka, Nov 28 (bdnews24.com)  The top Asian Development Bank official in Dhaka Wednesday said poor IT infrastructure stymied the growth of Bangladesh's capital markets. Hua Du, the ADB's Bangladesh country director, said a lack of access to trading information was a barrier to greater investor confidence. She also identified deficiencies in financial disclosure, weak corporate governance and a lack of investor confidence in fixed income securities as major constraints to the growth of the capital markets. The country director was speaking at a workshop titled "Bangladesh Capital MarketsEngine of Economic Growth" co-organised by the ADB and Citigroup Global Markets (CGM) Bangladesh Private Ltd at Hotel Sheraton. She said Bangladesh's capital markets needed to meet international standards, and had to establish guidelines and procedures for participants in the securities business. Speaking as the chief guest, SEC chairman Faruq Ahmed Siddiqui emphasised co-ordination between banks, financial institutions and regulatory bodies to develop the markets. He said more entities, both public and private, should participate. The SEC chief lauded the government's move to offload shares of public sector entities on the bourses. He said private sector participation was sluggish and the reasons should be identified. Siddiqui stressed the need to review IPO face values because they increased significantly a day after being listed on the exchanges. This did not benefit issuers, he added. He said the SEC was outlining measures to review IPO prices before they appeared on the bourses. The workshop was led by international and local experts from the ADB and Citigroup to share best practices in global capital markets. The meeting was attended by regulators, financial market intermediaries, leading listed and non-listed corporations in Bangladesh and other important stakeholders. bdnew
