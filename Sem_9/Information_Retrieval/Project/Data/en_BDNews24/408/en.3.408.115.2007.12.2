 Moscow, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Russia was voting on Sunday in a parliamentary election expected to hand a big victory to President Vladimir Putin's United Russia party and help him keep a hold on power after his term ends next year. The following is a breakdown of how Russia voted in the last election to the lower house of parliament, or State Duma, in 2003. A direct comparison is not possible because the Dec. 2 election is being run under new rules, under which lawmakers are elected exclusively from party lists. In 2003, there was a mixed party list and constituency system. SEATS IN PARLIAMENT United Russia......................300 Communist Party....................52 Motherland (a nationalist party not running in this year's election ..........................37 LDPR (a nationalist party).........36 Independents ......................23 Seats left vacant .................3 This breakdown changed during the parliament's term because lawmakers joined other factions and the Motherland faction ceased to exist. SHARE OF THE NATIONAL VOTE (percentage of votes cast for each party in the party list section of the election) United Russia......................37 Communist Party....................13 LDPR...............................11 Motherland.........................9 TURNOUT: just under 56 percent (62 percent in the previous parliamentary election in 1999) bd
