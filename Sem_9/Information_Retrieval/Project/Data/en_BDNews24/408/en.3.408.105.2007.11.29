<TEXT>
 SINGAPORE, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks rallied while the low-yielding yen and bonds struggled on Thursday after comments from a top Federal Reserve official increased expectations of interest rate cuts to support the US economy. The positive mood was set to extend to Europe, with financial bookmakers expecting shares to extend Wednesday's sharp gains. Commodity prices rose, led by oil which jumped more than $1 on news of a pipeline fire disrupting Canadian supplies to the United States. US crude traded near $92 a barrel, up from Wednesday's two-week low of $90.33. Gold which serves as a hedge against inflation and often tracks oil prices, also recovered some ground to trade above $806 an ounce. Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Donald Kohn signalled a willingness to lower borrowing costs, saying financial market turmoil could slow the US economy and the Fed had to be flexible. His comments, which came just a day after two other Fed officials hinted they would not support a rate cut at the next policy meeting on Dec. 11, sent Wall Street stocks soaring. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 2.6 percent, its biggest percentage gain in 4- years. Asian markets followed suit with Tokyo's Nikkei average closing up 2.4 percent at a two-week high and the MSCI's measure of other Asia Pacific stocks climbing 3 percent by 0630 GMT. The MSCI index is still some 10 percent off its Nov. 1 record high, but is up a third this year, triple the 10 percent gain for MSCI's key world stock index "Markets are jumping on relief there might be a rate cut at the moment," said Neale Goldston-Morris, head of equity strategy at Macquarie Equities in Sydney. "But there is still a lot of pain to go through." "Until credit markets restore normality, it's hard to see equity markets making any consistent headway." Indicating a tentative revival in risk appetite, yield spreads between emerging market debt and US Treasury notes -- a gauge of risk aversion -- tightened a further 4 basis points after crunching in 15 ticks overnight. Safe-haven Japanese and US government bonds dipped, sending yields higher. Japanese 10-year bond futures were down 0.14 point, moving further away from last week's 22-month high. BANKS SHINE Bank stocks, recently pounded by worries about billions of dollars being written off in credit losses, led the rebound with Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ rising 6.1 percent and Citigroup jumping nearly 8 percent in Tokyo. In Hong Kong, Ping An Insurance soared 7.3 percent after buying a stake in European financial services firm Fortis. Resource stocks were back in favour following a recent slide touched off by worries about the outlook for global growth. BHP Billiton added 1.7 percent and Toho Zinc climbed 4.6 percent, helped by stronger prices for base metals such as copper and zinc. Among major markets in the region, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index soared 4.1 percent, while Singapore's and South Korea's benchmarks jumped 3 and 2.3 percent respectively. YEN STRUGGLES Rising stocks put the low-yielding yen under pressure. The dollar hit a one-week high against the Japanese currency overnight, before giving up some ground in Asian business to trade around 110 yen The euro dipped below Wednesday's two-week high of 163.60 yen to around 163 yen and held above $1.48 after bouncing off the overnight low near $1.4710. Oil, which hit an all-time high above $99 earlier this month, pulled back this week after signals OPEC may pump more crude and higher-than-expected US inventory data. But prices are still some 40 percent above mid-August levels and news of a fire at an oil terminal in Minnesota revived supply concerns on Thursd
