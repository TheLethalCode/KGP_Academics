<TEXT>
 New Delhi, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A free trade pact between India and the European Union would provide a big boost to both economies and would shore up global demand if the world economy begins to cool, EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson said. Reinforcing strong growth in India, the world's fastest-growing major economy after China, was now an integral part of maintaining global economic demand, he said on Thursday. "I think along with the Doha world trade talks, our FTA potentially has a very important role not just in boosting our economies but also the global economy as a whole," Mandelson told businessmen at an India-EU business summit. "An FTA will significantly increase Indian exports to the European Union, and EU imports and investment in my view have a valuable role in stimulating further the Indian economy." "Spurring Indian economic growth, poverty reduction, is of course very good for India, but it would also take up the slack if, as is widely expected, other parts of the global economy begin to slow." India's economy grew 9.4 percent in the fiscal year ending March 2007, its strongest pace in 18 years. Growth has averaged 8.6 percent over the past four years and policymakers expect about 9.0 percent this fiscal year. Mandelson said the EU was fully prepared to address issues of non-tariff barriers and intellectual property rights as it negotiates the India deal. Indian Trade Minister Kamal Nath restated his position that India wanted to seal a pact by the end of 2008. Mandelson gave little away in terms of a timetable. "The substance of this FTA is more important than the timing," he said. Nath added that India was looking for 90 percent of the items it trades with the EU to be included in the agreement, and said he expects the Europeans to place 95 percent of their tradeable items on the agenda. Indian and EU leaders will meet on Friday in an attempt to push forward the proposed free trade deal. The EU is increasingly drawing up a web of free trade pacts in Asia after the United States and Japan made inroads to tap into the high growth potential of these economies. European trade officials want to deepen discussions on sensitive areas with India, such as removing barriers to trade in services, intellectual property protection and public procurement. The EU is India's largest trading partner, accounting for a fifth of India's total trade, and is also one of its most important sources of foreign investment. "Growth in emerging economies will be a major driver for global economic demand and for maintaining a healthy global economy," Mandelson told businessmen. "It is a mark of India's growing weight alongside China that we look increasingly ... (for it) to play its role in the global econom
