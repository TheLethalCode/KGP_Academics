<TITLE> China property tycoon gets 16 years for graft </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SHANGHAI, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A disgraced Shanghai property tycoon was jailed for 16 years on Friday for corruption, his lawyer said, sealing the downfall of a former snack-shop owner who rose to become one of China's richest men. Zhou Zhengyi, who only a year ago completed a three-year jail term for stock market fraud and falsifying documents, was found guilty of five charges including misappropriation of funds, bribery and forging VAT receipts. The court described the verdict as lenient and said it took into account the fact Zhou had confessed to some of his crimes and returned much of the embezzled amount. Zhou, 46, once named China's 11th richest man with a net worth estimated at $320 million, was detained last year in a crackdown that followed the ousting of Shanghai's former Communist Party boss Chen Liangyu. Chen himself faces a criminal investigation for his part in a 3.7 billion yuan ($500 million) social security fund scandal. Dozens of other officials and executives have been jailed or investigated in connection with the case. The defence had yet to consult Zhou on whether to appeal, lawyer Xu Lanting told Reuters. Zhou's company was fined more than 3 million yuan ($406,400), Xu said. He declined to comment further. Prosecutors said last year they had uncovered Zhou's problems when probing the social security fund scandal, but their lengthy indictment paper did not mention the case or implicate any senior officials, the Southern Weekend newspaper said. Zhou, known in Hong Kong as Chau Ching-ngai, was president of Shanghai-based property firm Nongkai Development (Group) Co. as real estate in China exploded to become one of the country's most lucrative, and graft-scarred, sectors. He was accused of bribing officials with the Shanghai Futures Exchange as well as managers from state banks for funds and loans worth tens of millions of dollars from 1997-2003, the newspaper said. Zhou was also accused of bribing a senior prison official with 200,000 yuan through her sister for special treatment during his first jail term, the newspaper said. Chinese media have reported that several prison officials were sentenced for granting Zhou perks such as TV, an air conditioner, refrigerator and frequent visits by friends. Dozens of people had gathered outside the Shanghai Second Intermediate People's Court before Zhou's latest verdict was announced, many later whisked away in security vans. The reason was not immediately clear, but Zhou's controversial project to develop a prime plot of land in downtown Shanghai has made him a hate figure among thousands of evicted residents. Zhou is not the first of the country's super-rich to fall afoul of the law as China's wild-west economy booms and regulators struggle to keep pace with market reforms. Sun Shuhua, whose wealth was once estimated at $170 million, was arrested in May on fraud charges. Last year, Zhou Yiming, who in 2005 was the youngest entrant on Forbes' list of China's richest 400, was jailed for life for fraud. ($1=7.382 yu
