<TITLE> ASEAN's Surin says people may be ashamed of elite </TITLE>

 SINGAPORE, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Association of South East Asian Nations must change from being an elitist leaders' club to one owned by the people, who may be chafing over some members' slow moves to democracy, the next ASEAN chief said on Friday. ASEAN's signing of a landmark charter last week calling for a regional human rights body and economic integration was overshadowed by an international outcry over military-ruled Myamar's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protests. Surin Pitsuwan is set to face controversy over member Myanmar when he becomes ASEAN Secretary-General from January. "ASEAN has been an issue of the elites, by the elites, for the elites...what we need is that sense of ownership and belonging," Surin said at an ASEAN-focused conference in Singapore. He acknowledged that people in the region, particularly the educated and non-governmental organisations, might be ashamed of ASEAN's progress on pressuring Myanmar. He said people may also be looking for more fundamental freedoms across the region. "The rest also wish that in their own particular context they had more space," he said, adding he would start a blog called loveasean.com. ASEAN members Laos and Vietnam have told Reuters they have no plans for democracy. Singapore and Malaysia's parliaments are controlled by one party, while the Thai military overthrew a democratically elected government last year. But the Philippines president has warned that her Congress could scuttle the charter by not ratifying it, unless Myanmar moved towards democracy. ASEAN's policy of non-interference in members' internal affairs has also come under fire from regional media. The United States has said a free trade deal with ASEAN was impossible because of the political situation, and the EU has also called for more progress on Myanmar. Both have slapped sanctions on junta members and associated firms. "The disappointment is a reflection of goodwill," the former Thai diplomat said, adding that the international community wanted ASEAN to succeed because it was the only bloc outside the European Union that "worked, or seemed to work". "There is no going back," Surin said, echoing ASEAN's stance on Myanmar that calls for the junta to follow a roadmap to democracy. Progress had been made, he said, since Myanmar would have been off-limits for discussion not so long ago. Diplomats have dismissed the junta's roadmap as a blue-print for the army legitimising its grip on power. Arrests have continued and the junta shut down a monastery, an opposition lawyer said on Friday, raising doubts over its sincerity. "There will be heartache and headache coming up, and Surin will have to deal with that," said outgoing ASEAN Secretary-General Ong Keng Yong, adding he would start a blog called saveasean.c
