 NICE, France, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - France and Italy are expected to sign an energy cooperation deal at a bilateral summit meeting on Friday that should see Italy's Enel take stakes in six new-generation nuclear plans in France. The deal with French electricity operator EDF, flagged well ahead of the meeting in the southern French city of Nice, has not yet been formally sealed and neither EDF and Enel have so far made any comment. But Italy's industry minister Pierluigi Bersani said on Thursday he believed French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi would sign at the summit. Contrasting remarks from the two leaders on the European Central Bank, could also have an impact at the meeting, which will kick off with a military salute in the picturesque main square of Nice's old town. In an interview with Italy's Corriere della Sera newspaper, Sarkozy repeated his longstanding line that governments should be free to comment on ECB decisions and had a role to play in foreign exchange policy.

But the deal with Enel, whose tentative bid last year for utility Suez was blocked by the French government, is expected to be the centrepiece of the meeting. According to the Financial Times newspaper, the long-awaited deal would see Enel buy stakes in French power generation assets worth some 2 billion euros ($2.95 billion), giving it up to 3 percent of the French power market. The assets would include a 12.5-percent stake in six new-generation nuclear power stations in France -- including one at Flamanville in Normandy where that size stake is worth about 370 million euros -- and holdings of 40-49 percent in gas-fired power stations. EDF would get access to Enel nuclear, coal and gas-generation assets in Slovakia, Bulgaria and Russia, the Financial Times said. The deal would be the main feature of a wider agreement on energy policy and Italian power grid Terna and its French counterpart could also reach an agreement on transmission capacity, diplomats have said. With the tense situation in France's volatile, multi-ethnic suburbs highlighted by a renewed outbreak of urban violence this week, immigration policy will also feature heavily. Italy's proximity to the African mainland has made it one of the main entry points into Europe for clandestine immigration and Sarkozy told the Corriere della Sera that he hoped the meeting would foster a joint approach to immigrati
