<TITLE> Secret donor to Britain's Labour blames party </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The millionaire businessman at the centre of the scandal over secret donations to British Prime Minister Gordon Brown's Labour Party laid the blame at the political grouping's door on Saturday. Property developer David Abrahams said it was the party's job to check donations and that he was not aware he had risked breaking the law by giving money through third parties. Scotland Yard has been asked to investigate revelations that Abrahams donated 600,000 pounds ($1.24 million) to Labour through intermediaries. But, writing in the Guardian newspaper, Abrahams said the affair -- which has battered Brown's public standing -- was a "product of cock-up, not conspiracy". "I trusted the party to ensure that its donations were being received and spent in the manner in which they were intended, as anyone in my position would," he wrote. He earlier told Channel 4 News that Brown's chief fundraiser Jon Mendelsohn knew about his method of making donations in April -- five months earlier than Labour said it did. But the Guardian said Mendelsohn flatly denied Abrahams' statements over the timing of their discussions. Mendelsohn earlier suggested he only knew about Abrahams' method of donating to prominent members of the Labour party via "agents" in September. The Labour Party was not immediately available for comment on Abrahams' statements on Saturday. The police investigation is likely to involve Mendelsohn and will seek to establish exactly who knew about the donations that might have breached electoral laws. Electoral Commission rules require those making donations on behalf of others to give details of the source of the money. Brown has said the funds from Abrahams had not been lawfully declared and would be returned. A survey this week put the Conservative Party 11 percentage points ahead of Labour -- its biggest lead since Margaret Thatcher was at her most popular in the 1980s. A number of senior Labour figures have become embroiled in the row, and opposition parties have stepped up their criticism. Deputy Leader Harriet Harman has said she acted in good faith in accepting a 5,000-pound donation from Abrahams through a go-between, a move newspapers said had involved Brown's campaign coordinator. And on Thursday, Work and Pensions Secretary Peter Hain said he had failed to register a 5,000-pound donation from Labour's chief fundraiser because of an administrative error. The scandal is the latest in a series of setbacks for Brown, who has also presided over the Northern Rock disaster -- the first run on a bank in Britain in more than a century -- and news last week the government has lost computer discs containing the personal details of 25 million people.
