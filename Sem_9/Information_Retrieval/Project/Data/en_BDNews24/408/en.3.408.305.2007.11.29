<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com)  There has been no such national disaster that may call for a halt to the 'election express', said chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda Thursday. "It's true that because of recent recurrent natural disasters, the Election Commission is faced with certain hindrances in voter registration in affected areas," he said during the EC's electoral reform dialogue with Samyabadi Dal (ML). "We've postponed voter listing in Patuakhali and Barguna districts, but the process is ongoing in the rest of the country," Huda said. The 10-member Samyabadi Dal delegation led by general secretary Dilip Barua followed other parties in proposing the barring of war criminals and anti-liberation elements from national elections. It also proposed stripping the armed forces of their powers to arrest during elections, using transparent ballot boxes, scrapping the 'no vote' option, establishing an independent EC secretariat and reducing election expenses to Tk 3 lakh per candidate. Speaking to reporters after the dialogue, the chief election commissioner said the national elections had not been held within 90 days of the caretaker government assuming power for various practical reasons. The Election Commission will notify the government as soon as it is ready to hold elections, he said, reiterating that the elections would be held by 2008 without fail. On voter registration for the permanent residents of the Chittagong Hill Tracts in accordance with the CHT Peace Accord, Huda said: "The constitution is the supreme law in the country and there will be a CHT voter list prepared constitutionally." "But certain steps for effecting the harmonisation of the peace accord with the constitution have to be taken." bdnews24.com
