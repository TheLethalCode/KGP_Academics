 ANKARA, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Turkish army said it entered northern Iraq on Saturday to tackle a group of between 50 and 60 Kurdish rebels. Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday his cabinet had authorised the armed forces to conduct a cross-border operation against Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) rebels. "As part of intelligence work, a group of 50-60 PKK terrorist group was spotted inside Iraq's borders," the army said on its website. "An intense intervention was made on the group and it was detected that the terrorist group had suffered heavy casualties." The army said it could step up its "intervention" in the region if this was needed. Turkey has amassed up to 100,000 troops near the mountainous border, backed up by tanks, artillery and warplanes, for a possible strike into mainly Kurdish northern Iraq against rebels of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) hiding there. Ankara has made many threats of military action but, under heavy US pressure, has so far shown restraint. Washington fears a large-scale operation could destabilise the most stable part of Iraq and possibly the wider region. Turkey's parliament approved a resolution on Oct. 17 giving the government the legal basis to order cross-border military operations if and when it deemed them necessary. The resolution, approved by an overwhelming majority of lawmakers, followed a series of deadly PKK attacks on Turkish security forces that fanned an angry wave of nationalism across Turkey, a NATO member that also wants to join the EU. That resolution was valid for one year. The cabinet decision this week effectively freed up the generals to act as they saw necessary without seeking further political approval. Erdogan held emergency talks with Bush on Nov. 5 in the White House, wringing from him pledges of closer cooperation, including more intelligence sharing against a group Washington also brands as terrorist. Northern Iraqi Kurdish authorities have taken steps to stop supplies reaching the PKK rebels in the mountains.
