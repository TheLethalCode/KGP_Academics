 SYDNEY, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jamaica's Asafa Powell will begin his 2008 campaign with two races in Australia, Athletics Australia said on its Web site on Thursday. The 100 metres world record holder will run in the Sydney Grand Prix on Feb. 16 and the World Athletics Tour meet in Melbourne on Feb. 21 as he continues his preparations for next year's Olympic Games. Powell, who set his world record of 9.74 seconds in Italy in September, won the 100m at last year's Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. "I am very excited about coming back to Australia," Powell said in a statement. "My experiences at the Commonwealth Games were amazing. I can really feel the support of the people of Australia. Nowhere outside of Jamaica have I felt so welcomed and supported by a crowd." The 25-year-old Powell finished third behind American Tyson Gay at this year's world championships in Osaka, Japan, a setback in his bid to win the Olympic gold medal in Beijing. Powell will be joined in Australia by training partners Michael Frater, Darrel Brown and Sherone Simpson
