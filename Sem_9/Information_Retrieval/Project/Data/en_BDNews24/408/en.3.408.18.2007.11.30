<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com)People must be made aware of the real situation with regard to the incidence and occurrence of AIDS in Bangladesh, said speakers at a press conference Friday organised by Asia Peoples' Alliance for Combating HIV-AIDS. Simply reporting the number of affected persons in the country was not effective in raising people's awareness to combat the disease, they said. The public also needs to know how the million-dollar funds brought in for combating HIV-AIDS are being spent, said member-secretary of the organisation Saqiul Millat Morshed. "Unfortunately, civil society, the media and the general public in Asian countries are still left out of all deliberationslimited though they areover the rights of AIDS patients to universal health care and related issues," Millat pointed out. Millat alleged that the government had allocated $40 million in funds received from the World Health Organisation to a group who claims to work in the field, without ensuring transparency and accountability. "Many are heard to be working on HIV-AIDS in Bangladesh, but no one really knows who are involved in the work and who all are doing what, when and how," Millat said. Poor human rights situations, lack of democratic practices, conflicts, religious fundamentalism and gender disparity have increasingly contributed to further complicating the incidence and occurrence of HIV-AIDS, said other speakers at the press conference. They stressed the urgent need for practicing accountability and transparency by all actors in the field in dealing with HIV-AIDS-related issues. bdnews
