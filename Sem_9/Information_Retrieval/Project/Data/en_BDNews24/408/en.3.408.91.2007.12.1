 Gaza, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Israeli missile strike killed at least five Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip on Saturday, Palestinian hospital officials and Hamas said. The Islamist Hamas movement, which seized control of the Gaza Strip in June after fighting with forces loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, said three other militants were wounded in the strike. It said the attack occurred near the southern Gaza town of Khan Younis. An Israeli army spokesman confirmed there had been an air strike against militants in Gaza. The Israeli army frequently carries out attacks against militants in the coastal territory to try to stop them from firing rockets at southern Israeli towns. bdn
