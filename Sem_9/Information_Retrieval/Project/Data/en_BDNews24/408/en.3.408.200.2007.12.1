 Dhaka, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com) - Teletalk, the state-run mobile operator, has earned the sponsorship of the best of three football matches series between Abahani Limited and Mohammedan Sporting Club, the two popular outfits, to raise funds for Sidr victims . The matches will be held on December 3, 5 and 7 at Bangabandhu National Stadium. "Teletalk accepted our proposal to sponsor the series for the Sidr victims and we hope the first-ever football series between Abahani and Mohammedan would be a competitive one," said Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) president SA Sultan at a press conference Saturday. The BFF and the Teletalk Saturday inked a deal in this regard at the BFF House. Teletalk will provide Tk 3 lakh for the sponsorship right. Sultan urged the supporters of both sides to turn up at the big bowl to extend their helping hands to the cyclone-affected people. "We support such initiative taken by the BFF and we hoped that everyone would help us as we have a little experience in sports," said Teletalk managing director Aminul Hasan. Shahnewas Chowdhury, marketing manager of Teletalk, said they would spend more to make the series a success. "From tonight (Saturday), we launch the campaign through SMS to our subscribers," said Chowdhury. The BFF has already opened 21 booths to sell tickets in the city. The football governing body will hold a rally Sunday starting from the BFF House and terminating at the National Press Club. bdn
