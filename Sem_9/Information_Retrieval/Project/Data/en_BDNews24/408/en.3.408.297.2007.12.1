<TITLE> Group slams Saudi rape ruling defence as "appalling" </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 RIYADH, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New York-based Human Rights Watch has criticised as "appalling" Saudi government attempts to defend a verdict of 200 lashes against a woman who was gang-raped. The 19-year-old Shi'ite woman was abducted and raped along with a male companion by seven men in a case that has drawn criticism from around the world, including US presidential candidates. Ruling according to Saudi Arabia's strict reading of Islamic law, a court originally sentenced the woman to 90 lashes for being alone with an unrelated man and the rapists to prison terms of up to five years. The Supreme Judicial Council last month increased the sentence to 200 lashes and six months in prison and ordered the rapists to serve between two years and nine years in prison. The Justice Ministry took the rare move of issuing two public statements defending the verdicts, arguing that the woman was having an extramarital affair. Her defence team says she was not married at the time and was not having an affair. They say the authorities are trying to ruin her reputation before Saudi public opinion. "The Ministry of Justice's response to criticism of its unjust verdict has been appalling," Human Rights Watch said in a statement on its Web site, quoting researcher on women's issues Farida Deif. "First, they attempted to silence this young woman, and now they're trying to demonize her in the eyes of the Saudi public." The second ministry statement appeared to accuse the woman of adultery, claiming she was having "forbidden relations" when alone with the man on the night of the rape. Human Rights Watch has called on King Abdullah to abrogate the verdict against the woman. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal tried to distance the Saudi government from the ruling at a news conference in the United States last week. "Unfortunately, these things happen. Bad judgments occur in legal systems," he said. "It is a process that is still going on. This is being reviewed by a legal process and we hope it will be changed."
