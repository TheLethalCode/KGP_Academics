<TITLE> JJB reassures on profit, but downbeat on Euro 2008 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Nov 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British retailer JJB Sports is no longer expecting a boost from the Euro 2008 soccer finals following the England team's failure to qualify last week, but reassured investors its 2007 results were on track. Shares in Britain's second-biggest sporting goods retailer, which have more than halved in value since May, climbed as much as 7.9 percent in early Thursday trading. "Following today's encouraging announcement we expect consensus forecasts (for 2007) to increase," Numis Securities analysts wrote in a research note, adding that they were expecting a pretax profit of 40 million pounds ($83 million) for the year ending January 2008 versus a consensus of 36 million. JJB, which runs around 420 shops and 40 health clubs, said like-for-like revenues rose 1.6 percent in the 17 weeks to Nov. 25, down sharply from a 5.2 percent increase reported after 8 weeks of that period. But it also said its gross margin -- a measure of profitability -- had increased by slightly more than the 380 basis points reported at the 8-week stage. This was better than most analysts had been expecting, though not all were impressed. Kaupthing analysts trimmed 1 million pounds from their profit forecast for this financial year to 37 million pounds and 3 million from their forecast for next year to 50 million. CAUTIOUS OUTLOOK "We continue to be cautious about the retail market outlook both in the run-up to Christmas and into 2008," JJB Chairman Roger Lane-Smith said in a trading update. This echoed the tone of other British retailers recently, such as electrical goods group DSG International on Wednesday, as a string of interest rate rises and a cooling housing market take their toll on consumer spending. Shares in JJB, which sells items such as soccer kits to bikes to golf equipment, were up 5.7 percent at 144.25 pence by 0915 GMT, valuing the business at about 338 million pounds. The stock has slumped this year, hit by the slowdown in consumer spending and a profit warning in September. Recently, it has suffered concerns that the England soccer team's failure to qualify for the Euro 2008 finals will knock sales of replica kits, after warnings to that effect last week from rival Sports Direct and kit maker Umbro. "The disappointing exit of the England team from the finals of the Euro 2008 competition is not anticipated to have any material impact upon the results of the current accounting period to end January 2008," JJB said in its statement. "As far as the next accounting period is concerned, JJB is not expecting any incremental revenues from Euro 2008." Umbro agreed to be bought by US sports giant Nike last month. But JJB bought a 10 percent stake in Umbro around the same time in a move it said was aimed at protecting its interests in relation to Umbro's contract with the England soccer team. Sports Direct owns 29.9 percent of Umb
