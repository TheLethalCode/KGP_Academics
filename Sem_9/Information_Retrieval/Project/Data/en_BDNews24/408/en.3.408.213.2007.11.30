 N'DJAMENA, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chadian anti-government rebels on Friday declared a `state of war' against French and foreign military forces in an apparent warning to a European Union peacekeeping force that plans to deploy there soon. French troops and aircraft are stationed in Chad under a bilateral defence accord. The EU force, around half of which will be French, is preparing to deploy near the eastern border with Sudan in coming weeks to protect refugees and aid workers.

Rebels have been fighting Deby in the east for two years. They have in the past criticised France's support for him, but have stopped short of direct hostilities with French forces. Chad is a former French colony, and France is providing around half of the 3,700 EU peacekeepers who are due to start arriving early next year on a UN mission to protect camps housing more than 400,000 Chadian and Sudanese refugees. The EU force for Chad, which will also send soldiers to the northeast of the Central African Republic, is intended to try to help contain a widening conflict in Sudan's Darfur region, which has pushed armed raiders and refugees across the border. It will complement a bigger United Nations/African Union peacekeeping force planned for Darfur, where political and ethnic conflict triggered by a 2003 rebellion has killed at least 200,000 people, experts s
