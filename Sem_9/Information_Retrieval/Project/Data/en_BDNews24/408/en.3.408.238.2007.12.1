 Baghdad, Dec 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Suspected al Qaeda militants killed 10 people when they raided a Shi'ite Muslim village north of Baghdad early on Saturday, police said. An unknown number of civilians were also wounded when the Sunni Islamist gunmen raided the village of Dwelah in volatile Diyala province north of Baghdad. The attack came a day after Iraqi government statistics showed the number of civilians killed throughout the country in November fell to the lowest level in nearly two years.
