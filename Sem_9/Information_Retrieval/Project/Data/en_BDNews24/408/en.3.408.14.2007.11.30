<TEXT>
 LONDON, Nov 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The British government said it would be pressing on Friday for the release of a teacher sentenced to 15 days in jail for insulting Islam by allowing her pupils to name a teddy bear Mohammad. Gillian Gibbons, 54, was sentenced to 15 days in prison followed by deportation by a court in Sudan on Thursday after being charged with insulting religion. The teacher, who was cleared of inciting hatred and showing contempt for religious beliefs, had faced the prospect of up to one year in jail, 40 lashes or a fine.

"It is unfortunate that the Sudanese authorities were found wanting in this most basic of qualities. They grossly overreacted in this sad affair and this episode. "Gillian should never have been arrested, let alone charged and convicted of committing a crime." Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, spiritual leader of the Anglican Church, also condemned the verdict. "I can't see any justification for this. It is an absurdly disproportionate response to what is at worst a cultural faux pas," he told BBC television. However Robert Boulos, headteacher of Unity high school where Gibbons worked, said it was fair. "We are happy with the verdict," he said. "We will be very sad to lose he
