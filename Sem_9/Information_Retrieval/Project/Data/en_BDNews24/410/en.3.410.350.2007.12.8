<TITLE> Hong Kong chokes on pollution for second day </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Hong Kong, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hong Kong is shrouded in the worst air pollution of the year for the second day running on Saturday, with hills across Victoria harbour invisible despite a sunny dry weather. Pollution monitoring station registered "very high" readings in several spots around the former British colony since Friday when the Environment Protection Department warned people with heart or lung problems to avoid outdoor activities. Residents are increasingly worried over the rising number of smog-ridden days caused by the city's coal-fired power stations, cars and trucks, and a booming manufacturing sector across the border in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong. The Air Pollution Index (API) surpassed 101, reaching what the department considers very high level at several places by mid-day after hitting 151 -- the highest level this year -- in the posh Central business district late on Friday. The city, which on a rare clear day offers a stunning view of sparkling ocean, green mountains and skyscrapers, is choking on smogs as 190 countries meet in Bali to launch a new international deal to fight global warming. CLP Holdings Ltd, the larger of Hong Kong's two power utilities often under attack by environmental groups, pledged on Friday it would cut the carbon intensity of its global power generation by 2050. But Chan Ka-keung, CLP Group's director of renewable energy, told the South China Morning Post that it has yet to enact definite plans to achieve the aggressive goal.
