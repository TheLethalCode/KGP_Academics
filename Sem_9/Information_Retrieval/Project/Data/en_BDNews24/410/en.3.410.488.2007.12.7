 Dhaka, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com)  A civil-society organisation has demanded $3000 million from the industrialised nations in compensation for devising strategies and combating climate change in Bangladesh. SUPRO (Shushashoner Jonnyo Procharavijan or campaign for good governance) made the demand Friday in a written statement prepared on behalf of the civil societies. SUPRO chief executive Pradeep Kumar Roy read out the demands at a press conference held at Dhaka Reporters' Unity at noon. The demands are to be forwarded to the ongoing Bali Summit on climate change for compensation from the developed nations whose activities have led to gross changes in the global climate regimes. The changes have resulted in exacerbating all types of natural disasters recurrently affecting the poorer and less developed countries more and more adversely, it said. The meeting cited the example of cyclone Sidr which ravaged the Bangladesh coasts only three weeks back. It said that the nations whose excesses had already caused and were still causing climate changes globally must pay befitting compensations to the affected nations who just cannot afford such catastrophic wastes. The other demands forwarded include reduction of GHGs (greenhouse gases) emission by at least 30 percent within 2020 by the industrially advanced nations and paying compensations to the poorer nations. Undertaking rehabilitation of the damaged environments and paying Bangladesh special carbon tax calculated as per carbon trading modes payable by the developed nations again. Speakers from Oxfam, ActionAid and other environmental action NGOs complained that global temperatures had been rising as a direct result of the industrialised nations emitting carbon dioxide at gargantuan rates. The emission has been causing sea level rise, salinity intrusion into the freshwater environments and recurrent devastating natural disasters such as, floods, cyclones, droughts and so on. Bangladesh's coasts too are seeing excessive salinity and higher tidal and wave actions resulting in land loss and grave agricultural production losses, they said. Mentioning and quoting from satellite imagery and demographic data in SUPRO's written statement, Roy said over 72 lakh people were displaced during the period 1981-1993 and large-scale riverbank erosion had rendered at least 40 lakh people homeless. The meeting urged raising a full-scale greenbelt along the Bangladesh coasts, building adequate number of cyclone shelters, strengthening the environment and forest ministry, raising mangrove forests, special budget allocations for disaster management and enhancement of allocations for the environment sector. Earlier in a press conference by the Development of Biotechnology and Environmental Conservation Centre, some civil society representatives demanded compensation, not aid, from rich nations as they are mostly responsible for human-induced natural disasters. DEBTEC chairman Syed Marghub Morshed and executive director Ferdous Begum were present. They said they would submit a memorandum to the United Nations secretary-general and the chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. bdnews24
