<TITLE> UK Minister orders cut in translations </TITLE>

 London, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Translating official documents and signs has undermined efforts to integrate people who don't speak English, the government said on Friday. Communities Secretary Hazel Blears said the current practice of widespread translation of everything from street signs to council leaflets means some immigrants do not learn English. Unveiling new guidance for public bodies, she called for a fundamental change, with fewer translations and more emphasis on integration. "Translation can never be a substitute for learning English and we need a fundamental rebalancing of our approach, putting a greater focus on learning English," she said in a statement. "Automatic translation of all public materials can just reinforce the language barrier, act as a brake on opportunity and make it harder to integrate non-English speaking residents into the country." Public bodies will not break race relations laws if they cut back on translations, she added. Councils spend about 25 million pounds each year on translators, according to media reports. The NHS spends at least 55 million pounds. Blears said it was unacceptable for councils to translate documents into languages that aren't spoken in their particular region. A common sense approach is needed, she added. The government has come under intense pressure from opposition parties to take a tougher line on immigration. Shadow Home Secretary David Davis has accused Labour of adopting an "open door" policy, underestimating the number of immigrants and failing to give councils enough money to cope. The government says migrant workers have helped the economy, but critics claim they have put pressure on public services.
