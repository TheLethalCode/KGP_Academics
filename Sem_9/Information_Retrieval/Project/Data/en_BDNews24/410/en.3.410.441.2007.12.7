<TITLE> Peru's Fujimori faces trial for civil war abuses </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LIMA, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - For 15 years, Raida Condor organized marches and lobbied Peru's Congress in pursuit of what seemed liked an impossible goal: putting former President Alberto Fujimori on trial for the murder of her son, Armando. That day finally comes on Monday when Fujimori will stand before justices of the Andean country's Supreme Court to face charges he violated human rights during his 1990-2000 rule. "We aren't looking for revenge, but we demand justice," Condor, who often appears in public with a large picture of her son on a string around her neck, told Reuters this week. He was one of nine students snatched along with a teacher from La Cantuta university by a government security squad in 1992. The 10 suspected leftists were later executed, their bodies dumped in a shallow grave outside the capital Lima. Fujimori's trial, which will be televised, is seen by rights activists as a remarkable turning point for a country long hobbled by a weak judicial system, impunity for the powerful, and painful memories of a civil war that claimed tens of thousands of lives. It is also a rare case of a former head of state facing trial in his own country on human rights violations. "This is an opportunity to address human rights abuses, affirm Peru's commitment to democracy ... and allow the judiciary to regain its independence," said Walter Alban, a law professor who served as Peru's rights ombudsman after Fujimori left office. "Fujimori was elected, but he governed as a dictator," Alban said. The Supreme Court will hear charges that Fujimori ordered his security team to carry out the massacre at La Cantuta, another one that claimed 15 lives, and two kidnappings. If convicted, Fujimori faces up to 30 years in prison. A separate trial will follow for charges that his intelligence agency wiretapped political opponents and paid bribes to broadcasters and members of Congress. Prosecutors say their case is airtight after Chile's Supreme Court studied the charges and extradited Fujimori in September. The ruling ended seven years of exile for the 69-year-old former president, five of them in Japan. KIDNAPPINGS, DISAPPEARANCES Condor's son Armando was just one of many Peruvians ensnared in counter-insurgency campaigns against two left-wing rebel groups -- the Maoist guerrillas known as the Shining Path and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement. Critics say Fujimori's administration often violated civil rights and sometimes targeted innocent people in its zeal to stamp out guerrillas and leftist militants. Universities were seen as breeding grounds of rebellion so spies were planted in student groups. Suspected radicals were put under surveillance and some were tortured and murdered. Fujimori used the threat of terrorism to consolidate power, shutting down Congress in 1992 to pass tough laws targeting armed leftist groups. Months later, Fujimori scored a major political victory when police caught Abimael Guzman, the supreme leader of the Shining Path, whose soft-spoken demeanor belied his deep faith in using violence as a tool for political change. Even after the capture of Guzman, who was arguably the biggest threat to Peru's government, Fujimori's grip on power tightened during the next eight years. Some people without any links to leftist groups were persecuted, apparently to settle personal scores. "They threatened to kill my wife and each of my daughters ... and said I wouldn't make it home alive," Gustavo Gorriti, a journalist who was kidnapped by the military, told Reuters. He had written stories in the 1980s linking Vladimiro Montesinos to drug traffickers and was later targeted during Fujimori's rule when Montesinos, a former military officer turned lawyer, led the government's intelligence apparatus. Montesinos, who was once Fujimori's closest confidante and is now in jail, is expected to testify against him. Although polls show the majority of Peruvians oppose Fujimori, up to a third of voters support him. He is credited with bringing peace, ending hyperinflation and passing reforms that have helped turn Peru into one of the world's fastest-growing economies. His supporters say it is unfair to target the man who ended a vicious guerrilla war that erupted in 1980, when the Shining Path took up arms. Around 70,000 people died or disappeared in fighting and massacres between the military, the Shining Path, the Tupac Amaru, and peasants in poor mountain towns. Most were killed before Fujimori took office in 1990, and the violence quickly faded after Guzman and other Shining Path leaders were captured. "I think it's absurd to make the man who defeated subversives stand trial," says Fujimori's daughter Keiko, who is a member of Congress and often touted as a candidate for president in 2011.
