<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com)  A special judge's court Sunday deferred to Thursday the verdict on a tax-dodge case against former state minister Ziaul Haque Zia's wife Nasima Haque. The verdict was not handed down Sunday as the judge of Special Judge's Court-4 set up on the Sangsad Bhaban premises was on vacation. Prosecution lawyer Mahbub Ahmed told bdnews24.com, "The verdict was not delivered as the judge was on leave. In absence of the court, judge Ashraf Hossain of the Special Judge's Court-5 set Thursday for the delivery of the verdict." Nasima Haque is on the run. The same court on Nov 29 sentenced Zia to eight years in jail for not paying tax. Verdict in another tax-dodging case against their son Mashfiqul Haque will be handed down on Dec 13. On Sept 23, assistant tax commissioners Farzana Sultana and Pankaj Lal Sarkar of the National Board of Revenue filed two cases against Zia and Nasima. They charged them with submitting a flawed statement on their income tax, concealing information and wealth. Zia stands accused of evading tax on Tk 4.23 crore and Nasima on Tk 1.77 crore income and assets. bdnew
