 Tokyo, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japanese stocks hit a fresh one-month closing high on Friday, propelled by a weaker yen and buying of exporters such as Toyota Motor Co amid an easing of fears about the health of the US economy. Steel firms, construction and real estate also did well, among the majority of sectors rising on short covering by day traders, who provided most of Tokyo's market activity. US President George W. Bush unveiled on Thursday a mortgage assistance plan that includes an interest rate freeze for some of the most distressed borrowers boosting Wall Street and then Tokyo. "There's just too many big events lining up for next week, so given that this is just ahead of a weekend, nobody wants to hold positions and they began to get rid of them around mid-afternoon," said Masayoshi Okamoto, head of dealing at Jujiya Securities. US jobs data is due out later on Friday, with the market watching the figures keenly for clues to what the U.S. Federal Reserve will decide when it meets on Dec. 11. "An interest rate cut is basically already factored in, but the question is now whether it's 25 basis points or 50, and whether any of their statements hint at more interest rate cuts in the future," Okamoto added. "The jobs data will really determine a lot of what happens next week -- confirming everyone's feelings about a rate cut if they're bad, which will send the market higher. Expect active trade in Tokyo on Monday." Additional support in the early part of the day came from rises in other Asian stocks, particularly in Hong Kong, where the Hang Seng index opened more than 1 percent higher. "Positive sentiment in the rest of Asia, especially China, didn't have a direct impact on Tokyo, but the sentiment appears to have provided a bit of a boost all the same," said Masayoshi Yano, senior manager of investment information at Tokai Tokyo Securities. MSCI's index of other Asia Pacific stocks was up 0.4 percent at 0636 GMT. A late wave of profit-taking sales ate away much of the benchmark Nikkei's gains for the day, though it still finished up 0.5 percent at 15,956.37, its highest close since Nov. 7. Earlier it rose as high as 16,107.65, a gain of more than 200 points. The broader TOPIX index gained 0.6 percent to 1,561.76, also a one-month high. It earlier touched 1,578.39. EXPORTERS, STEEL SOLID Another factor for the week ahead will be the Bank of Japan's quarterly tankan survey, due out next Friday, which Okamoto said was likely to be poor. The dollar gained slightly against the yen during Asian trade and was hovering near 111.32 yen It neared a three-week high of 111.47 yen hit the previous day. With a lack of other active trading factors ahead of the jobs data, the market zeroed in on currencies, giving exporters a boost until the profit-taking trimmed their gains. Toyota, one of the key supporting stocks on the Nikkei 225, closed up 1.6 percent at 6,340 yen, with other car makers not far behind. Honda Motor Co rose 1.3 percent to 3,870 yen, and Nissan Motor Co gained 1.1 percent to 1,263 percent. Steel companies were late gainers, though market participants said all resource-linked stocks, such as trading houses, were doing well. JFE Holdings jumped 4.5 percent to 5,850 yen and Nippon Steel Corp rose 2.6 percent to 666 yen. Shares of home builders rose after the Nikkei business daily said the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's tax panel decided on Thursday to extend all housing-related tax breaks set to expire and to introduce new measures to support the ailing housing market. Sekisui House gained 3.5 percent to 1,340 yen while Daiwa House Industry Co jumped 6.5 percent to 1,597 yen. The panel has decided to extend by another two years a measure that halves the fixed-assets tax on new homes for three years after purchase, the Nikkei said. The measure is due to expire on March 31, 2008. Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp said after the close that it would invest 9.5 billion baht ($280 million) to build a small-car factory in Thailand that will start production in 2010. Trade was moderate on the Tokyo exchange's first section, with 2.2 billion shares changing hands, in line with last week's daily average. Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones by nearly two to one.
