<TITLE> Inefficiency, changes in technology pushing unemployment up: Azizul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com)  Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Sunday disagreed with the view that trade liberalisation has pushed the unemployment rate up in Bangladesh. "It is due to changes in technology and inefficiency rather than trade liberalisation," Azizul told a dialogue on 'Trade liberalisation in Bangladesh: Implementations for employment' at the BRAC Centre Inn. The adviser's comments came on the heels of a study presented by Centre for Policy Dialogue which claimed that trade liberalisation has caused an increase in unemployment countrywide. Azizul also claimed that trade policy was not responsible for the decline of the jute sector. He blamed inefficiency in its management for increase of losses in the industry. CPD in its study claimed employment in general has suffered due to trade liberalisation. It said the manufacturing sector's share of total employment was still very low and has not shown any increasing trend. Azizul denied the CPD findings saying that inefficiency in the management of industries not trade liberalisation has increased unemployment. He said export-oriented industries are getting the benefits of liberalisation. However, according to international studies, some least-developed countries could suffer net losses even from the partial liberalisation of trade contemplated in the Doha Round. Studies, such as those by World Bank, find that Bangladesh and some Sub-Saharan African countries could be net losers as they are net food importers and benefit from preferential access in European and American markets. There has been significant liberalisation of trade in Bangladesh through the 1990s. The maximum tariff rate has been cut to 25 percent from as high as 350 percent in the 1970s and early 1980s. Azizul also said the country's trade policy did not contribute to any rise in unemployment. If it did, he said, labour intensive industries would not be flourishing in Bangladesh. The adviser said today's trade policy has been formulated to encourage efficient, and discourage inefficient, industries. Sunday's dialogue, jointly organised by CPD and ILO (International Labour Organisation), was chaired by Prof Rehman Sobhan. bd
