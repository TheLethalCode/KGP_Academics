<TITLE> Kremlin dismisses report of new Putin role </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Reports that President Vladimir Putin plans to create a new role for himself heading a union of Russia and ex-Soviet neighbour Belarus are "sheer speculation", a Kremlin source told Reuters on Friday. Analysts have long suggested that Putin, who wants to keep power after his presidential term ends next May, might opt to head a new "union state" joining the former Soviet neighbours. Putin has not yet disclosed his plans. "There's this general madness going on right now," the Kremlin source said. "It's a kind of distorted form of public debate about Putin's political future. Nothing other than that." A source in the Belarus presidential administration said he knew of no plan to agree a union pact soon. "I doubt this is true ... nothing is known about anything as radical as that," he said. "You should not pay much attention to this report." The editorially independent Ekho Moskvy radio station had reported earlier on Friday, quoting sources in Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko's entourage, that Putin would sign a union state agreement with Belarus during a visit to Minsk on Dec 13-14. It said Putin would head the new union state. Talks between Belarus and Russia about a political union have dragged on for years. Belarus's desire to keep autonomy and disagreements over who might take the lead role in a merged state have prevented significant progress, though the two countries do have a customs and immigration union. Putin had a public argument with Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko last year when Moscow more than doubled gas prices to Belarus, an impoverished state still running a command economy largely unchanged from Soviet times.
