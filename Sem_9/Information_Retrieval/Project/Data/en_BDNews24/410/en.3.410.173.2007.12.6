 BRUSSELS, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union's 27 states are doing too little to fight terrorism, the bloc's anti-terror chief said on Thursday. Gilles de Kerchove, who became EU anti-terrorism coordinator in September, said in a report that EU states failed to share enough information, should do more to fight the financing of terrorism and needed to give support to non-EU states. "Considerable deficiencies remain in sharing information at national level ... those deficiencies constitute one of the main obstacles to cooperation at European level," the report said. "There still has not been much progress on the abuse of the non-profit sector by terrorist financers," de Kerchove wrote. The Belgian diplomat, appointed after the job had been vacant for six months, said the EU should step up the fight against terrorism on the Internet, including by blocking Web sites giving instructions on bomb-making and by tasking the EU police office Europol to conduct more Web surveillance. His job is to helps the EU set up and coordinate its anti-terrorism policies but he has no decision-making power. The European Commission last month proposed that all EU states make it a criminal offence to incite terrorism over the Internet or use the Web for militant recruitment. The EU executive was working on measures to prevent the distribution of violent radical content on the Internet, de Kerchove said.
