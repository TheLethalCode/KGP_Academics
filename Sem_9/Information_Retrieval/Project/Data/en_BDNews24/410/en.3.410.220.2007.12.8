<TITLE> Boca bank on "El Loco" magic in Japan </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Disallowed from fielding one prodigal son, Argentina's Boca Juniors are banking on captain Martin Palermo to lead them to Club World Cup glory in Japan. The talismanic striker will be immortalised at Boca after scoring twice in a 2-1 win over Real Madrid in the tournament's previous incarnation seven years ago. "That was an unforgettable night," Palermo told reporters on Saturday. "To score two goals to beat a great club like Real Madrid was incredible. You only get that sort of feeling once in a lifetime." South American champions Boca face the winners of Sunday's game between Mexicans Pachuca and Tunisia's Etoile Sahel in the tournament's first semi-final on Dec. 12. Barring any unforeseen shocks, a Kaka-inspired AC Milan loom in the final four days later in Yokohama. With Juan Roman Riquelme ineligible after missing FIFA's entry deadline following his return to Boca from Spanish side Villarreal, the pressure on Palermo will be immense. "We will miss Riquelme," said Palermo, huge diamond studs glistening in both ears. "He is a terrific player and took much of the responsibility on his shoulders. "But the rest of the players need to work hard to fill the gap left by his absence here. We're desperate to take the trophy back to Argentina." BRAZILIAN HAT-TRICK Brazilian clubs have won the last two versions of the revamped tournament, Sao Paulo beating Liverpool 1-0 in 2005 and Internacional stunning Barcelona by the same score last year. FIFA staged a first world club championship in 2000 when Brazil's Corinthians won on home soil, but pulled the plug on the competition in 2001 after the collapse of marketing partner ISMM/ISL. Boca won the Club World Cup's forerunner, a one-off game between the champions of Europe and South America, three times, the last time beating Milan on penalties in 2003. But the man known as "El Loco" is under no illusions about the task facing his side, who lost out on this season's Argentine Apertura championship last month. "No disrespect to our team but Milan are frightening," said Palermo, who also left Boca to join Villarreal, playing for them from 2001 to 2003 before spells at Real Betis and Alaves. "Nevertheless if we play them in the final it will be one game and it's in those situations where we thrive -- it doesn't matter who it is.
