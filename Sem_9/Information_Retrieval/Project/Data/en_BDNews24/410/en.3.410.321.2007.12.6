Youth and Sports Adviser Tapan Chowdhury announced the names of the athletes and organisers at his ministry's conference room Thursday breaking the previous tradition of declaring the names through a press release. "We tried to honour those athletes and organisers who are veteran athletes and also publicity- shy persons," said the adviser adding that many deserving persons for the award were ignored in the past.
