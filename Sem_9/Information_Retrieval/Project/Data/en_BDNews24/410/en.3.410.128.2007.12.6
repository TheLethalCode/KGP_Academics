 CAPE TOWN, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An African good governance report has praised South Africa's constitution and economy but raised concerns about the country's high levels of crime and effort to battle AIDS, a government spokesman said on Thursday. South African officials have been studying the delayed final report of the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM), which was set up to promote greater political accountability on the continent, since it was turned over to Pretoria last week. "The report highlights a number of strengths which characterise the South African society," Themba Maseko, the government's main spokesman, said in a video conference from the capital Pretoria. Maseko said the peer review had cast a favourable light in particular on the South African constitution, seen as one of the world's most liberal, as well as the country's legal system, strong economy and robust public financial management system. South Africa's controversial black economic empowerment policy, which has seen disenfranchised blacks given a larger stake in the economy, also was applauded despite criticism it remained the preserve of a politically connected elite. But Maseko conceded that the peer review, which was delayed in part because of South Africa's disagreement over what it described as "factual errors" in the original report, was also frank about the country's failings. "The report also highlights ... high HIV infection rates and high levels of violent crimes," he said. South Africa's government has drawn heavy criticism for failing to effectively battle violent crime as well as the AIDS epidemic. President Thabo Mbeki has horrified activists by questioning accepted AIDS science and initially refusing to make life-saving anti-retroviral drugs widely available in a nation where some 365,000 die annually from the disease. Other problems mentioned in the report included the challenges posed by racism and xenophobia and deficiencies in the education system. South Africa has denied allegations of dragging its feet on the APRM initiative in the wake of criticism that it had whitewashed its contribution to the report, which was supposed to be delivered at an African Union summit in January. "There were a number of factual inaccuracies that were included in the first draft of the report," Maseko said, adding that South Africa's disagreements with the report were incorporated as a supplement in the final version. The APRM country review and assessment, prepared by a team of "eminent persons" from the New Partnerships for Africa's Development (NEPAD), is a voluntary process that was agreed upon by 26 AU states. It is designed to show foreign investors that governments on the continent are serious about political and economic reforms. Only a handful of nations have completed their reviews.
