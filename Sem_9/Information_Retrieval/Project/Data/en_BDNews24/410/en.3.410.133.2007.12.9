<TITLE> Iran state bank, under sanctions, to sell shares </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TEHRAN, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran's state-owned Bank Mellat on Sunday brushed off the impact of US sanctions and said it was pressing on with a long-standing plan to sell its shares to the public. The United States imposed sanctions on Bank Mellat and other Iranian bodies, including part of Iran's military, in October as part of a bid to press Tehran to halt nuclear work that Washington says could be used to make bombs. Bank Mellat and its subsidiaries have dismissed as "baseless" the US charges, which included accusing the bank of providing banking services to support Iran's nuclear activities. "The banking operations are continuing ... business as usual," Ali Divandari, the 40-year-old chairman and managing director, told Reuters in his office overlooking Iran's sprawling capital. The bank plans to offer 5 percent of its shares to the public to help determine a price before more are sold, he said, adding that the initial offering was expected to go ahead this Iranian year ending in March. Official media said it would be the first state bank sold. The bank is being sold in line with Article 44 of the constitution, which was changed to encourage the sale of state assets. Divandari said the process to sell Bank Mellat began before the latest US moves to impose sanctions on Iran. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's top authority, has called for the swift implementation of Article 44 but progress has been slow. Private businesses have shown limited appetite for shares in state-owned firms. Divandari said Article 44 was "the turning point for the economy of the country, and other matters like sanctions are temporary". He said there was even interest in the bank's shares from abroad, although he gave few details. DEALING WITH RESTRICTIONS "Even foreign investors are negotiating with us, from some European and Middle East countries ... They can buy a maximum 10 percent of the shares." Divandari dismissed the impact of US sanctions because he said the bank had stopped U.S. dollar transactions and most of its work was domestic, based on 10 million Iranian customers. Operations abroad were dealing with any restrictions, he said. Asked about the London subsidiary, he said it had been "subjected to the American sanctions (and) that subsidiary has been doing its transactions (in currencies) other than dollars ... If they ever had any operational problems, they solved it." He again dismissed US accusations against the bank. When placed on the sanctions list, the US government said Bank Mellat had "facilitated the movement millions of dollars for Iran's nuclear programme since at least 2003". A US intelligence report released on Dec. 3 said Iran halted its nuclear weapons programme in 2003. Iran denies ever having had such plans. Divandari said the bank was opening an increasing number of letters of credit, a vital tool in international trade. Iranian executives complain that letters of credit opened by Iranian banks are increasingly refused by foreign suppliers, including firms in China, which has been resisting a US push for a third round of UN sanctions on Iran. Some executives say they now make direct transfers rather than opening letters of credit, which is more risky but often the only route. Even then, Iranians say the list of foreign banks willing to deal in transfers in and out of Iran gets shorter by the month.
