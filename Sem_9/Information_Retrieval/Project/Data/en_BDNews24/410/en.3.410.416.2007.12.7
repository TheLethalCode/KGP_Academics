 BRUSSELS, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - NATO ministers pledged on Friday to keep their KFOR peace force in Kosovo at current strength as it heads towards independence and to make more troops available as necessary to deal with any violence. Ethnic Albanian leaders of the breakaway Serbian province are expected to declare independence in the next couple of months after the failure of international mediation, potentially sparking new unrest in the Balkans. "KFOR shall remain in Kosovo on the basis of UN Security Council resolution 1244, unless the Security Council decides otherwise," ministers agreed in a final communique. "We renew our commitment to maintain KFOR's national force, contributions, including reserves, at current levels and with no new caveats," they added, using the military term for limits that nations sometimes impose on what their troops can do. Such caveats meant NATO was caught badly off-guard during rioting in 2004 which it struggled to control. International mediators will report to the United Nations on Monday that efforts to reach a compromise between Pristina and Belgrade failed. Russia wants further mediation, but the West says the time to settle Kosovo's status has come. Washington and the vast majority of European Union states are likely to recognise a declaration of independence by Kosovo, and are confident that its leaders will wait until around late January to enable NATO and the European Union to prepare for it. "It is increasingly likely that the Kosovars will act in consultation and in coordination with us," a senior State Department official told reporters. "I doubt to the vanishing point that this will happen next week."
