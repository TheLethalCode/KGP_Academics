 Dhaka, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com)  Grameenphone chief executive officer Anders Jensen Friday promised to take stern actions against the mobile phone operator's officials involved in the illegal VoIP business. "Some additional irregularities have been found relating to Grameenphone providing special service to illegal VOIP operators," Jensen said in a statement Friday after RAB raided overnight its headquarters in Gulshan. "An investigation is ongoing and Grameenphone is fully cooperating with the law enforcement agencies in this regard." He said he was unaware of his company providing special services to VoIP operators. "We are trying to get to the bottom of this whole affair and I can assure that stern measures will be taken against anyone involved within Grameenphone." "I have been completely taken by surprise by this latest development as all of this happened before I started my tenure as CEO," Jensen said. "Apparently not all information was given to me. I was assured by the relevant people in the company that all VOIP-related issues were already cleared," the GP boss said. bd
