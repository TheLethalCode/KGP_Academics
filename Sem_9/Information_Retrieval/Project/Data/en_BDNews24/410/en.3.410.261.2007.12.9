<TITLE> Gaddafi visits France on road to `redemption' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Paris, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi takes a further step towards shedding his status as an outcast of the West on Monday with his first visit to France in 34 years, and business deals will be high on the agenda. The five-day visit will include at least two meetings with French President Nicolas Sarkozy, demonstrating Gaddafi's newfound respectability and offering the French leader a chance to secure lucrative contracts in a relatively untapped market. "We hope that a large number of commercial agreements will be signed," Sarkozy's spokesman David Martinon said on Friday, citing talks on arms and nuclear energy contracts, but giving few details of Gaddafi's schedule during the visit. Sarkozy has made a point of inviting Gaddafi since Libya in July released six foreign medics accused of infecting Libyan children with HIV. Paris helped broker their release. Sarkozy's diplomatic adviser Jean-David Levitte told a parliamentary commission countries like Libya had a "right to redemption". "Here is a country that did everything to make itself a pariah ... and here is a country that progressively has done everything to come back into the concert of nations," he added. The West long accused Gaddafi of backing terrorism but ties with Tripoli have warmed since it scrapped programmes to develop weapons of mass destruction in 2003 and agreed compensation for families of victims of bombings of U.S. and French airliners. "If we do not welcome and we do not speak to countries that become respectable, that turn their back on orientations that were condemned by the international community, then what do we say to Iran, what do we say to North Korea?" Sarkozy said last month. He is also eyeing a third business bonanza in as many weeks, after trips to China and Algeria yielded more than $37 billion combined in contracts. Gaddafi, who will receive guests in his Bedouin Arab tent, also wants to develop his own economy. "Libya thought and still thinks that the key to re-entering the world political stage is in Washington and that the main European states, including France, have only a secondary role," said a senior European diplomat based in Tripoli. But Libya, rich in oil and gas reserves, still saw France and other European Union states as vital to developing its economy, he said. "Libya wants to be a member of the World Trade Organization and needs the support of France and other European states. Tripoli has a bold economic plan that needs foreign investment." BUSINESS VERSUS HUMAN RIGHTS? North African political analyst Ali Anzoula said Gaddafi, who has yet to be invited to the United States or Britain, was also banking on Sarkozy's close ties with Washington. "Gaddafi hopes his visit to Paris will help him speed the normalisation of ties with the United States and visit Washington soon," he said. Gaddafi's son Saif al-Islam said in an interview with newspaper Le Figaro published on Saturday that Libya would buy more than 3 billion euros ($4.4 billion) worth of Airbus planes, plus a nuclear power plant. It was also in talks to buy Rafale fighter jets, for which a foreign buyer has not been found in eight years, and wanted to buy "numerous" items of military hardware, he said. Gaddafi's son added, however, that Tripoli also wanted a retrial over the 1989 bombing of a French UTA plane over the West African country of Niger, for which six Libyans were convicted in absentia and for which Libya paid compensation. The visit could prompt fresh criticism of Sarkozy, who caused disarray in the EU this week by congratulating Russian President Vladimir Putin for his party's victory in a widely criticised election. Sarkozy's Socialist opponent in the presidential election, Segolene Royal, has called Gaddafi's visit "intolerable", and Amnesty International said the visit should not overshadow human rights violations in the North African state
